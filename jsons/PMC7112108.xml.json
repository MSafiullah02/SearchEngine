            "text": "MBR applications in China started as early as 1990 (Zheng et al., 2003; Zheng et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2010; Abass et al., 2015; Xiao et al., 2014). In 1999, the first pilot scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) application in China was tested, which was used to treat industrial wastewater with a scale of only 10 m3/d (Zheng et al., 2003). Since then, MBR research and applications in China have been growing dramatically in that the first MRB application with the treatment capacity of 100,000 m3/d was commissioned within 8 years in Beijing (Zheng et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2010; Abass et al., 2015). The total capacity of large-scale MBRs (\u226510,000 m3/d) reached 1.7 \u00d7 106 m3/d in 2010 (Fig. 1\n). Both the capacity and number of MBR applications increased rapidly. A national survey of membrane manufacturers and operators was conducted to characterize MBR applications in China. Based on the survey, the number of large-scale MBRs in China approached 192, with the total capacity exceeding 11.17 \u00d7 106 m3/d by 2017. Taking the under-construction projects into account, the number of large-scale MBRs is expected to approach 210 with the total capacity exceeding 14.04 \u00d7 106 m3/d by 2018. The MBR applications with a capacity of 50,000 m3/d or more are shown in Appendix A.",

The scientific and technical perspectives of MBR have received much attention in literature and engineering operations of MBR applications have also been investigated extensively in China (Wang et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2010; Zheng and Liu, 2006; Sun et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2012; Zheng and Liu, 2007; Zheng et al., 2005; Lv et al., 2006). A number of membrane materials and modules, such as hollow fiber membranes, flat-sheet membranes, tubular membranes, have been employed in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment facilities in China since the 2000s (Huang et al., 2010; Abass et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2008). The various anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic MBR (AAO-MBR) processes for municipal wastewater treatment have been extensively investigated and denitrification on these occasions was enhanced since the 2010s, such as Hefei Tangxihe WWTP and Wuxi Chengbei WWTP (Xiao et al., 2014).",

In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a contagious and sometimes fatal respiratory illness, occurred in China, which highlighted the importance of public health management and drew the attention of government and public into sanitary safety (Sun and Gu, 2007). The Olympic Games in 2008 were held in Beijing and the Asian Games in 2010 took place in Guangzhou. Both events were aimed to be green games to improve the environment and promote the games (Zheng et al., 2016).

The first membrane bioreactors were developed commercially by Dorr-Oliver in the late 1960s, with application to ship-board sewage treatment (Bemberis et al., 1971). The initial designs, specifically the sidestream MBR configuration are tailored towards a direct hydrodynamic control of membrane fouling and offer the advantages of easier membrane replacement and high flux production but at the expense of high energy consumption. The typical energy consumption of sidestream MBR was 6\u20138 kWh\u00b7m\u22123, almost ten times higher than conventional activated sludge process (CAS, 0.3\u20130.4 kWh\u00b7m\u22123). The high energy consumption by sidestream MBR limited its applications (Le-Clech et al., 2006; Judd, 2012).",

            "text": "To expand MBR applications, it is vital to reduce the energy consumption by MBR. In 1989, Yamamoto invented submerged MBR and removed the circulating pump which greatly reduced energy consumption (Yamamoto et al., 1989). By the early 1990s, Zenon introduced a series of immersed hollow fiber membrane modules (Urbain et al., 1996). Over this period, Kubota also developed flat-sheet membrane products with improved overall energy efficiency, introducing a double-decker design in 2003. The energy consumption for sidestream systems is usually one or two orders of magnitude higher than that of submerged systems, regardless of whether the system is used for municipal or industrial wastewater treatments (Gander et al., 2000). Generally, the external configuration provides more direct hydrodynamic control of fouling and offers the advantages of easier membrane replacement and high fluxes at the expense of high energy consumption (of the order 10 kWh\u00b7m\u22123) (Le-Clech et al., 2006). Several distinct advantages of submerged configuration are their much lower energy consumption, only 0.6\u20132 kWh\u00b7m\u22123, which is only 10 to 20% of sidestream MBR (Lin et al., 2012). The invention of submerged MBR remarkably improved MBR efficiency and promote applications of MBR worldwide. The research in China has improved membrane flux capacity from 8 to 12 L/m2/h to about 15\u201325 L/m2/h as well.",

            "text": "The research of MBR in China started in the 1990s which was much later than the first study on MBR abroad, but it developed dramatically. In 1990, Li (1990) firstly published a review of MBR and introduced MBR to China (Li, 1990). Fan et al. (1998) later used MBR to treat petrochemical wastewater. In 1999, Zheng et al. (2003) conducted a pilot test of MBR to treat textile wastewater and laid a foundation for the commercial applications of MBR in China (Zheng et al., 2003). The study of sidestream MBRs was dominant before 2001 while submerged MBRs were more popular since 2001 because of its lower operational cost. Since 2003, a modified sidestream MBR (also called as airlift external circulation MBR), replacing the recirculation pump by H-type recycling pipe, has been well studied for the treatment of toilet wastewater and municipal wastewater (Fan et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007; Fan et al., 2005). Another innovative submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor (SAMBR) was developed in 2004. The membrane fouling was controlled by recirculating the biogas and inducing the mixed liquor turbulence (Wang et al., 2008). Since 2004, many efforts have been dedicated to the study of this SAMBR for the treatment of high-strength alcohol-distillery wastewater. In order for broader applications of MBR, self-forming dynamic membrane bioreactor (SFDMBR), a process even without manufactured membrane, has been proposed, with cheap coarse pore-sized materials such as Dacron mesh, stainless steel mesh, glass fiber, nonwovens, etc., employed as filtration media (Fan and Huang, 2002; Wu et al., 2005; Chu et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2010). In general, among these studies submerged MBRs were mostly utilized for municipal wastewater treatment while the sidestream MBRs were commonly applied for particular industrial wastewater treatment. The objectives of research on MBR may lie in two aspects: utilization and optimization. Research on the utilization of MBR includes the exploration of new functions, pragmatization, scaling up and operation maintenance. The optimization aims at higher operational efficiency better performance for target pollutants removal, lower constructional and operational cost and lower energy consumption during operation. While the scientific research and studies in China are progressing continuously, the much more prominent phenomenon since commercial applications of MBR started in China is the remarkably growth in a short period. The summary of the MBR applications history is presented in the following section.",

In 1991, the first large-scale sidestream MBR system for treating industrial wastewater was constructed in North America at the GM Mansfield plant (Judd, 2012). Following this development, numerous MBR systems for treating industrial wastewater were installed in the United States and Canada. From the late 1980s to early 1990s, the government incentivized water recycling program prompted pioneering work by Yamamoto to develop an immersed MBR process in Japan. By 1996, 60 immersed flat-sheet MBR plants had been installed in Japan providing a total capacity of 5500 m3/d (Zheng et al., 2016; Judd, 2012).",

Appendix A provides a list of national plans and policies that has promoted MBR applications in the last decade. According to the Water Pollution Prevention and Control Plan, the wastewater reclamation rate in China should reach 20% by 2020, which provided a great opportunity for MBR technology to be widely used in the upgrading WWTPs due to MBR's distinct technical advantages of high treatment efficiency (Zheng et al., 2016). Additionally, the development of membrane materials has been outlined in the 12th National Five-Year Plan (2011 to 2015), such as Strategy of Accelerating Cultivation and Development of Emerging Strategic Industries, from both aspects of environmental protection and technological development. These national policies provided enormous opportunity for MBR applications (Huang et al., 2010; Abass et al., 2015; Xiao et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013). In general, public policy in China increase the demand on MBR application as it often promotes wastewater treatment and reclamation.

Therefore, the demand on advanced technology to treat hospital sewage is increasing. In addition, as large hospitals in China are often located in the city centers, where land prices and office rentals are prohibitively high, the ideal hospital sewage treatment systems should use minimal land and space. Generally, hospital wastewater is treated with primary treatment and disinfection process (often by chlorine, ozone and ultraviolet light) and infectious hospitals must use secondary treatment (Chen et al., 2006). MBR is an efficient technology in removing pathogenic microorganism. Its low SS of effluent is helpful to improve the efficiency of disinfection processes, minimize disinfectant, and reduce disinfection by-products (Zheng and Liu, 2007; Zheng et al., 2005). It improves disinfection effects and reduces the toxicity of effluent. In addition, it does not require secondary sedimentation tank and thus reduce land and space usage for wastewater treatment, which made it an ideal potential technology for treating hospital wastewater (Lv et al., 2006). The SARS event promoted MBR applications for treating hospital wastewater (Zheng et al., 2016). Table 1\ndemonstrates some typical MBR applications for treating hospital wastewater.

            "text": "Given that energy demand contributes significantly to the running cost of an MBR system, it is important to optimize the process energy consumption to make the technology more competitive. The high energy consumption of MBR plants is due to membrane fouling and clogging and high DO concentrations for a large amount of biomass. Energy cost of aeration plays a key role in the total energy consumption in MBR processes. Optimization of aeration is consequently believed as the most effective way to cut down energy requirement and eventually lower operating cost. Energy consumption was reduced in China by elevating the aeration efficiency for membrane scouring by bettering the configuration of membrane module, aeration system, and tank geometry. Much of the MBR plants development over the past 12 years has focused on maximizing the mixing imparted by membrane air scouring while minimizing the amount of air required for this, resulting in significant improvements in energy efficiency. According to some surveys, the energy consumptive could be as low as 0.5 kWh/m3 for large MBR plants. Table 9\nlists the specific electrical consumption of integrated/submerged-MBR. It indicates that the specific electrical consumption of integrated/submerged-MBR ranges from 0.31 to 0.70 kWh\u00b7m\u22123, and a little higher than that of average electrical consumption of CAS (0.34\u20130.38 kWh\u00b7m\u22123) in China.",

Membrane fouling could be reduced in these major ways: gas sparging, sustainable flux operation, activated carbon/coagulant/flocculent addition, membrane modification, backwashing, and physical and chemical cleaning. The demand for better fouling control strategies in China has set the pace for improvement of membrane materials and design in modern MBR systems. In contrast to that in Europe or North America, the development of advanced filtration is rapid in China. Polymer-based membranes, ceramic or inorganic membranes, and nano-composite membranes for MBR applications are all among these. It thus provides sound ground for the rational use of the technology in China. Inorganic membranes, such as aluminum, zirconium and titanium oxide, demonstrate better hydraulic, thermal, and chemical resistance when used as filters in MBR (Abass et al., 2015).",
