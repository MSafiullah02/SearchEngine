            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the major risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)1. However, the mechanism of HBV-induced HCC remains unclear2. The HBV genome is a partially double-stranded DNA molecule with four open reading frames (ORFs) termed S, C, P, and X3. The X gene of HBV (HBx) encodes a 154 amino acid polypeptide that is essential for viral infection and replication and plays a crucial role in the development of HCC4. Although HBx does not bind to DNA, it exerts a pleiotropic effect on diverse cellular functions as a transcriptional co-activator. HBx exhibits many activities in vitro. In a cell culture system, HBx is able to activate the transcription of host genes, such as c-Myc, as well as viral genes5, 6. HBx is also involved in different cytoplasmic signaling pathways. The majority of HBx is localized in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with and stimulates protein kinases such as protein kinase C, Janus kinase/STAT, IKK, PI-3-K, stress-activated protein kinase/Jun N-terminal kinase, and protein kinase B/Akt. HBx induces centrosome hyperamplification and mitotic aberration by activation of the Ras-MEK-MAPK pathway, which may contribute to genomic instability during hepatocarcinogenesis7. HBx can transactivate various cellular transcriptional elements, such as AP-1, AP-2, NF-\u03baB, and cAMP response element (CRE) sites. Consequently, HBx can affect the activities of various transcriptional elements in the host cell and elicit different cellular responses. Previously, we demonstrated that HBx upregulated both the expression and the activity of hTERT in hepatoma8. We also found that HBx was able to upregulate the expression of survivin, which suggests that survivin may be involved in the carcinogenesis of HCC that is mediated by HBx9. cDNA microarray is a powerful tool for identifying disease-related gene expression profiles in biological samples. Using cDNA microarray, we examined gene expression profiles in a model of hepatoma cells stably transfected with HBx10. These data from the hepatoma cell model showed progressive changes during tumor development. However, the mechanism of hepatoma mediated by HBx remains unclear.",

Double-stranded cDNAs (containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence) were synthesized from 1 \u03bcg of total RNA using the CbcScript reverse transcriptase with cDNA synthesis system according to the manufacturer's protocol (CapitalBio Corp, China) with the T7 Oligo (dT). cDNA labeled with a fluorescent dye (Cy5 or Cy3-dCTP) was produced by Eberwine's linear RNA amplification method and the subsequent enzymatic reaction and was improved by CapitalBio. The Klenow enzyme labeling strategy was adopted after reverse transcription using CbcScript II reverse transcriptase. All procedures for hybridization and slide and image processing were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The slides were washed, dried, and scanned using a confocal LuxScan\u2122scanner and the obtained images were then analyzed using LuxScan\u2122 3.0 software (both from CapitalBio Corp, China). The procedures were repeated for a replicate experiment with independent hybridization and processing. For individual channel data extraction, faint spots for which the intensities were below 400 units after background subtraction in both channels (Cy3 and Cy5) were removed. A space- and intensity-dependent normalization based on a LOWESS program was employed. To avoid false positive results, multiple testing corrections were considered. In each experiment, three types of positive controls (Hex, four housekeeping genes, and eight yeast genes) and two types of negative controls (50% DMSO and twelve negative control sequences from the Operon Oligo database) were used. Each probe was printed in triplicate. Furthermore, we performed the fluorescence-exchange microarray analysis. We performed three independent cDNA microarray experiments to obtain more precise data. For two-color designs, intensity reproducibility was calculated both within and across the two different dyes to assess the impact of the dye on the resulting measurement. For within-dye calculations, the technical replicates of samples labeled with the same dye across the microarrays were considered, and for across-dyes calculations, all replicates for a given sample labeled with either dye were evaluated. Comparisons between the combinations of P values and fold-change thresholds were given, with the differentially expressed genes identified using a one-sample t-test of the sample B to sample A (B/A) ratio data, including five replicates for each site. Two P values (P<0.05 and P<0.01) and three fold-change (FC) thresholds (FC>1.5, FC>2.0 and FC>4.0) were acceptable in the microarray analysis.",

The cDNA microarray showed that the expression levels of 152 genes were remarkably altered, 82 of those genes were upregulated and 70 genes were downregulated in the L-O2-X cells. The altered genes were associated with signal transduction pathways, cell cycle, metastasis, transcriptional regulation, immune response, metabolism, and other processes (Table 1). To avoid false positive results, each probe was printed in triplicate using a SmartArray\u2122 microarrayer (CapitalBio Corp Beijing, China). The cDNA microarray used was the fluorescence-exchange microarray. Additionally, we performed three independent cDNA microarray analyses to get more precise data. In Table 1, the expression of the selected candidates was either up- or down-regulated by at least two folds. When compared with the differential expression profiles in H7402-X cells10, we found that the data from the differential expression profiles in L-O2-X cells differed substantially. Only three genes, PCNA, BMP2, and IL-6, were altered in both H7402-X cells and L-O2-X cells.",

            "text": "Using a cDNA microarray technique, we identified and classified the genes that were altered as a result of their involvement in an HBx-mediated process (Figure 1). Our findings showed that 82 genes were upregulated and 70 genes were downregulated in L-O2-X cells (Table 1). Most were involved in the cell cycle, signal pathways, metastasis, immune response, metabolism, and other processes. Table 1 shows that many genes that have not been reported to associate with HBx in the literature were found by microarray assay, which provides us with valuable clues for the further investigation of HBx. Our data showed that cyclin A1, PCNA and Bcl-2 were upregulated, whereas p21 was simultaneously downregulated. Furthermore, the altered expression of PCNA and Bcl-2 was verified by Western blot analysis (Figure 2). HBx upregulates PCNA by increasing the recruitment of CBP/p300 to endogenous PCNA promoters19. Our microarray data were consistent with this report. Cyclin A1, a member of the cyclin A family, is related to some types of carcinogenesis20. p21 is a negative regulator of the cell cycle. BCL-2 family members form hetero- or homodimers and act as anti- or pro-apoptotic regulators that are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) play important roles in controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Defects in cell cycle regulation are common causes of the abnormal proliferation of cancer cells. Those proteins, which are mentioned above and are involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis, may greatly influence tumorigenesis. Another study indicates that many MAPK family members are upregulated in HBV-related HCC10, 21. Our present data showed that MAP2K2, MAP3K14 and MAX were upregulated, whereas Gadd45a was downregulated in L-O2-X cells; these changes may be related to rapid proliferation. All biological activities of c-Myc require its binding partner, Max22. c-Myc has been assigned roles in hepatocyte proliferation during liver development and regeneration, control of hepatic metabolism, and the dysregulated growth that occurs during heptocarcinogenesis23, 24, 25, 26. Therefore, the enhancement of Max may be consistent with the induction of c-Myc in L-O2-X cells to promote hepatocyte growth and proliferation. In our experiments, Gadd45a, a p53-regulated and DNA damage inducible protein, was downregulated. Gadd45 plays a role in G2-M arrest in response to DNA damage. Gadd45 can bind to multiple important cellular proteins such as PCNA, p21 protein, MTK/MEKK4 \u2014 an upstream activator of the JNK pathway \u2014 and Cdc2 protein kinase. Furthermore, some reports show that Gadd45 can inhibit cell transformation and tumor progression27, 28. Signaling by the Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins is essential both in normal embryonic cell-to-cell interactions and in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, including cancer29. First, Wnt proteins bind to receptors of the Frizzled and LRP families on the cell surface. Then, through several cytoplasmic relay components, the signal is transduced to activate transcription of Wnt target genes. Here, we found that both FZD10 (one of the Frizzled and LRP families) and CTBP2, which are involved in Wnt signaling, were increased. Additionally, BTRC, which may be a candidate for tumor-suppressive activities30, was decreased in L-O2-X cells. Indeed, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of CtBP2 (C-terminal binding protein family proteins) decreases cell invasion, and ectopic expression of CtBP2 enhances tumor cell migration and invasion. Importantly, the overexpression of FZD10 (a cell-surface receptor for molecules in the Wnt pathway) acts as a potential contributor to synovial sarcomas. Moreover, a humanized antibody against FZD10 might be a promising treatment for patients with tumors that overexpress FZD1031. Secreted-type glycoprotein WNTs can bind to FZD10 to transduce signals to the \u03b2-catenin-TCF pathway, the JNK pathway, or the calcium signaling pathway. Accordingly, variation in the Wnt pathway and other signals affected by the Wnt pathway that were seen in our study may contribute to the early carcinogenesis mediated by HBx.",

            "text": "Interactions between cells and their surrounding extracellular matrix are essential for the proper execution and regulation of survival, proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, and migration. Furthermore, cell-extracellular matrix contact regulates physiological and pathological processes, such as development, differentiation, and metastasis. Laminins, a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, are the major noncollagenous constituents of the basement membrane. Some reports suggest that a strong correlation between the high expression of LAMA4 (one of laminin family) and tumor invasion and metastasis indicates that it is a novel marker for the processes of tumor invasion and metastasis32. Our microarray data showed that LAMA4 was upregulated in L-O2-X cells. The chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted; CCL5) is a member of the CC-chemokine family, a group of small proteins with a highly conserved structure33. Using the cDNA microarray technique, we found that CCL5 was highly expressed in L-O2-X cells. Other studies indicate that CCL5s are inflammatory mediators with pro-malignancy activities in breast cancer and that they are shown to mediate many types of tumor-promoting cross-talk between the tumor cells and cells of the tumor microenvironment. Tumor-derived CCL5 can inhibit the T cell response and enhance the growth of murine mammary carcinoma in vivo34. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) induces either differentiation or growth of a variety of cells and also plays a role in cell interaction. In our study, IL-6 was upregulated in L-O2-X cells relative to L-O2 cells. Binding of IL-6 to its receptor initiates cellular events including activation of JAK kinases and activation of ras-mediated signaling. In addition, it has been suggested that IL-6 participates in the malignant progression of prostate cancer35. Adhesion of tumor cells to host cell layers and subsequent migration are pivotal steps in cancer invasion and metastasis. Organization of the cytoskeleton and cell adhesion molecules plays an important role in this event. Some candidates in our study were related to these cell processes, including CLDN4, CLDN7, CAV1, and CAV2. The family of more than 20 claudin (CLDN) proteins comprises one of the major structural elements within the apical tight junction apparatus, a dynamic cellular nexus for maintenance of a luminal barrier, paracellular transport, and signal transduction. Loss of normal tight junction functions constitutes a hallmark of human carcinomas. CLDN4 proteins are maintained or elevated in breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, whereas CLDN7 proteins are diminished in head, neck, and breast tumors36. The down-regulation of caveolin-1 (encoded by CAV1) and caveolin-2 (encoded by CAV2) is found in various types of primary tumors and cancer cell lines, indicating that these are candidate tumor suppressor genes37, 38.",

COX-2 is overexpressed in various cancers, including esophageal, gastric, colon, and pancreatic cancers39. It is possible that both tumor- and stroma-derived COX-2 could influence tumor proliferation, angiogenesis and/or immune function. Using the BrdU incorporation assay, we observed that HBx enhanced the proliferation of L-O2 cells by upregulating COX-2 (Figure 4). Our findings are concurrent with a report that HBx induces COX-2 through the activation of NF-AT to promote tumor cell invasion and metastasis40. LOXL2 catalyzes the crosslinking of collagen and elastin in the extracellular matrix and is assumed to be involved in tumor progress and cell adhesion. Some findings support the presumption that LOXL2 plays a role in malignant transformation41, 42.",
