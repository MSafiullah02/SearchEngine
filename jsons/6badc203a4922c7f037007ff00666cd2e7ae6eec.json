Thus, high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are considered to enhance the invading capacity of SARS-CoV-2.",

While ACE2 is moderately expressed in the bronchial epithelium and in type 2 pneumocytes, TMPRSS2 is strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of bronchioles and alveolar epithelial cells 18 . Although ACE2 was found to exist on alveolar epithelial cells at approximately similar level as in the whole lung, the expression level of TMPRSS2 protein was considerably different between the peripheral and central parts of the lung. Considering the peripheral parts of the lung to strongly express TMPRSS2, along with ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 may be considered to damage the peripheral area at the very beginning of infection. Thus, the present study could histologically resolve why chest CT reveals consolidation and ground glass opacities in the bilateral peripheral lobes in confirmed COVID-19 cases 19 . The tracheal epithelium, as well as nasal respiratory epithelium, was found to express both ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Unlike that in the nasal respiratory epithelium, TMPRSS2 was more strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of tracheal epithelium, hence suggesting the trachea to be more prone to developing clinical symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection than the nasal tissue.",

The palate displayed weak cytoplasmic staining of ACE2/TMPRSS2 in its epithelium, whereas the hypopharynx and esophagus had high expression of ACE2 and weak expression of TMPRSS2 in the epithelium. Weak-to-moderate co-expression of ACE2/TMPRSS2 in the squamous mucosa of the oropharynx and esophagus may explain the infrequent involvement of oral and throat symptoms in patients with COVID-19, without advancing to severity. Regarding ACE2 expression in the vocal cords, previous studies had provided conflicting results; while one study asserted lack of ACE2 expression in the vocal cords 18 , the other demonstrated ACE2 expression on the surface epithelium 20 ; the present study supported the latter.",

In the nasal respiratory columnar epithelium, while ACE2 was strongly positive in the cilia (red arrows), TMPRSS2 was weakly positive in the cytoplasm (red arrows). e\uff1aEpithelial cells of the palate showed diffuse immunopositivity for ACE2 and TMPRSS2.",
