            "text": "The enteritis complex was introduced by Whitney in 1976 to designate a group of diseases that include mucoid enteritis, typhlitis, typhlitis-diarrhea and hemorrhagic enteritis. Commonly observed symptoms include teeth grinding, anorexia, polydipsia, weakness, abdominal distension, profuse diarrhea, dehydration, hypothermia and death18. Enteropathies are recognized as a problem for domestic rabbits, being their etiology and pathogenesis poorly understood4. In commercial rabbit production, enteropathies are hard to diagnose; they can have a multifactorial etiology (hence the term \u201cmultifactorial enteritis\u201d) and are also known as \u201centeric syndrome\u201d14. This syndrome is a pathological complex characterized by various stressing and pathogenic factors acting synergistically, possessing varying degrees of virulence which can enhance their pathogenicity and cause damage to the intestinal tissue. Numerous studies have reported the isolation of Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium piliformis, Clostridium spiriforme, Escherichia coli\n21, 35, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp., Streptococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Campylobacter and Eimeria spp.,14, 19, 23, 24. Viruses seem to have an important but non-crucial role; overall, they are mild pathogens that do not induce severe clinical profiles14. Rotavirus16, Coronavirus4, and Parvovirus17 have been reported and it has been suggested that they could exert direct pathogenic activity by initiating the development of bacterial infections and/or of other viral pathogens by inducing minimal alterations in the intestinal epithelium17. Enteric diseases are important in rabbit production and cause severe economic losses, due to high mortality indexes, decrease in growth and reduction in the feed conversion ratio14. Studies in Cuba, Japan and Argentina have reported digestive pathologies as the main cause of mortality with percentages of 57.9%, 48.9% and 43% respectively24. In Mexico there are few reports concerning the agents involved in these pathologies39. Because of this reason, the aim of this study was to isolate pathogens from enteric disease in rabbits from Mexico.",

Biochemical tests of oxidase, catalase, triple sugar iron, ornithine decarboxylase, sulfide indol motility and urease were performed5, 10, 14.

The concurring presence of pathogenic agents identified in the intestine content samples is shown in Table 1\n. Results of the Fisher's exact test showed a statistically significant association of the clinical profiles and the presence of Eimeria spp. (p\n = 0.000), E. coli EPEC (p\n = 0.09), Mannheimia spp. (p\n = 0.001), Salmonella spp., Klebsiella spp., S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. (p\n = 0.006) (Table 2\n). In relation to the clinical profile observed, diarrhea (with varying characteristics) was the most frequent sign, followed by abdominal distension.",

Studies in other countries have reported the presence of eleven Eimeria species that affect rabbits in up to 70% of enteropathies, and, according to their level of pathogenicity, can cause reduced growth rate and feed conversion, and increased mortality19, 21. In this work we only identified by PCR six of the eleven Eimeria species in the samples, being E. magna and E. perforans the most frequently found, considered as mildly and lowly pathogenic respectively; however, although all the rabbits presented enteric disease, the association with other pathogens had not been reported. Interestingly in the present study, we found an association of Eimeria spp. with gram negative bacteria and less frequently with Gram positive bacteria. These results provide epidemiological evidence of synergism among Eimeria spp. and E. coli and other enteric pathogens. It seems that by being simultaneously present in the enteric profiles, these pathogens can increase their pathogenic potential3.",

These mechanisms are used by gram negative bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella spp. to increase intestinal wall disorganization, consequently invading the tissue6, 22, facilitating bacterial adherence and penetration27. Further, some Eimeria species enhance host mucogenesis since the mucus layer of the gastrointestinal tract is an excellent source of nutrients for some bacteria20. Blankets and globular particles of mucus associated with numerous bacteria on villi and extensive inflammatory lesions have been observed in rabbits with an enteric profile and bacteria were observed attached to the site of serious cell damage6.

Several authors suggest that rotavirus could be the main cause of enteric disease in rabbits and also be implicated as the etiological agent of severe enteric outbreaks16, 35. Lavazza et al.14 identified rotavirus in rabbits by electron microscopy (16.0%), detecting 3.3% to 36.6% in humans8, 27, 37, our findings show the presence of rotavirus in fewer cases (10.3%). The concomitant identification of rotavirus and other pathogens was detected in 5/6 (83.3%) samples. In vitro models of pathogenesis indicate that synergism between rotavirus and invasive bacteria involve specific biologic pathways: the attachment of, or the invasion through an up-regulation of specific receptors31. Bhavnani et al.3 found epidemiologic evidence of synergism between rotavirus and other enteric pathogens for producing enteric clinical profiles, either by enhancing attachment and bacterial invasion of intestinal epithelial cells or by producing inflammation promoting the development of bacteria by the release of fluid, mucin, cellular detritus and the secretion of antimicrobials, which could alter the composition of the gut microbiota, allowing pathogens to occupy their commensal niche. Lavazza et al.14, conclude that there was no association between viral positivity or negativity and the presence of bacteria. Our results agree with those of Dewr\u00e9e et al.6 and Rodriguez De Lara et al.23, about rotaviruses as the main cause of the epizootic outbreaks of diarrheas is questionable, particularly if considering that rotavirus are considered endemic and mildly pathogenic in commercial rabbitries. However, this is the first molecular report confirming the presence of rotavirus in the enteric profiles of rabbits from Mexico.",

Furthermore, they found Streptococcus as single isolates from rabbits with enteritis. Our results show the presence of S. aureus in association with Eimeria spp. in 5.2%. Streptococcus spp., were found both on their own (1.7%) and in a concurrent manner with protozoa parasite Eimeria spp. (1.7%). Isolation frequency was not as high as in the case of other pathogen, however, their presence indicates involvement in promoting enteric profiles in rabbits.",

It has also been isolated from an outbreak of diarrhea in nursing rabbits with 85% morbidity and 50% mortality; rabbits died within a 3 day period38. In the present study, we found Enterococcus spp., without any associated pathogenic agent in two samples of intestinal content (3.5%) related to diarrhea episodes, which suggests they could be etiologic agents.",

The presence of several pathogens in more than half of the intestinal content samples of the rabbits with enteric clinical profiles required to determine if these pathogens found concomitantly can act synergistically, and interestingly, if these clinical enteric profiles are different when they are produced by a single pathogen and if the presence of two or more pathogens, increasing pathogenicity.",
