In Hong Kong, peak influenza activities occur in both spring (January\u2013April) and summer (July\u2013September) [20]. PWH is a 1350-bed acute care general hospital operated by the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong that serves an urban population of 1.5 million. Each year, >200 adult cases of confirmed influenza are being treated at PWH [5, 21, 22]. A major nosocomial outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred at PWH in 2003 [15, 23]; since then, all patients hospitalized with acute febrile respiratory illnesses are put on droplet precautions; if influenza is confirmed, the patients will be isolated or cohorted in designated wards [21, 22]. As a hospital policy, all health care personnel working in medical wards are required to wear surgical face masks, and an on-duty nursing officer is responsible for monitoring compliance [5].",

Nosocomial outbreaks of infectious diseases, once identified, would be investigated by the outbreak management team (which consisted of physicians, microbiologists, infection control practitioners, nurses, and hospital epidemiologists) as part of the management protocol [23]. Affected cases would be reviewed daily, and clinicoepidemiological information collected real time as the outbreak evolved. These data were studied and discussed in daily meetings throughout the whole outbreak period. Control measures, including ward closure, patient isolation, and use of antiviral prophylaxis, would then be recommended. Virological investigations for influenza have been described elsewhere [21, 22]. In brief, nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were collected from symptomatic individuals and subjected to immunofluorescence assay and virus culture for diagnosis [21, 22]. In addition, for all confirmed cases, viral RNA was directly extracted for sequencing of the whole length of the hemaggultinin gene, as described elsewhere [24]; the nucleotide sequences in individual cases were then compared. Finally, a hemagglutination inhibition assay was performed (using the virus isolate obtained from the index patient as antigen source) to detect antibody rise in the paired serum samples collected from affected individuals [25].",

For the analysis, all patients who had ever stayed with the index patient during the period of his presence in the ward (from admission to transfer or isolation) and all health care workers (HCWs) who had worked in the same ward during the period were included. Attack rates of influenza among inpatients were calculated each day on the basis of their locating \u201cbay\u201d [15]. Univariate relationships between risk of acquiring influenza infection and spatiotemporal variables were analyzed using the \u03c72 test or the Fisher exact test. Variables with a P value <.1 were entered into a multivariate (stepwise) logistic regression model to identify independent factors associated with infection. Odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported for explanatory variables. In all analyses, a P value of <.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All probabilities were 2-tailed. Statistical analysis was performed using PASW Statistics software, version 17.0 (SPSS).",

Airflow rate through each supply diffuser, return grill, air purifier, and exhaust fan was measured in detail, as described elsewhere [15]. Dispersion of the hypothetical virus-laden aerosols, originated from the index patient's bed through the entire ward, was analyzed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The hypothetical virus-laden aerosols were modeled as gaseous and passive tracers, which have been shown to be able to model well the dispersion of droplet nuclei that were less than 5\u201310 microns in diameter. The commercial CFD software, Fluent, version 6.2, was used [15, 26]. The predicted concentration fields were compared with the locations of affected patients found in the outbreak.",

Although he was afebrile all along, his condition started to deteriorate, with increasing respiratory distress over the next few days. He became bed-bound. He developed type II respiratory failure on the evening of 31 March and underwent bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation support (the inspiratory positive airway pressure [IPAP] level was set at 14 cm H2O; inspired oxygen concentration, 50% at a flow rate of 7.5 L/min). After 16 h of ventilation in the ward, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit on 1 April for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Influenza H3N2 virus was subsequently isolated from a tracheal aspirate sample. He was given oseltamivir treatment and later recovered from his illness.",

The injecting air velocities from the HEPA air purifiers were substantially higher than that of the diffusers and thus dominated the overall airflow pattern.

In that study, CFD modeling demonstrated a close relationship between concentration of virus-laden aerosols and the risk of acquiring infection in various ward locations. We studied this outbreak using similar approach, and our findings provide further evidence to support the hypothesis that, under suitable clinical and environmental conditions, aerosol transmission of influenza virus can occur [2, 3]. In this outbreak, we postulate that infectious aerosols were generated continuously through the use of noninvasive ventilation for the index patient (which projected for at least 1 m sagittally to bed end) [29\u201331] for 16 h and these aerosols were blown toward the adjacent bay by an imbalanced indoor airflow created by an air purifier's outflow jet, which was located at patient's bed end. We believe that droplets and contact routes of transmission cannot entirely explain the outbreak because (1) the epidemic curve suggested a point-source mode of infection, instead of successive propagation (especially for the aggregation of symptom onset on 2 and 3 April); (2) the index patient and most other inpatients were immobile during their illnesses and, therefore, direct contacts should have been minimal; (3) patients >2 m away were affected; and (4) locations of affected patients coincided with dispersal pattern of aerosols and the directional airflow. In this outbreak, patients in the \u201cadjacent\u201d and \u201csame\u201d bay were similarly affected, but the \u201cdistant\u201d bay was spared. A more random distribution of infected cases would be expected if HCWs had acted as vectors, because they were responsible for the care of patients in all bays (duties were assigned on the basis of function and not location) [15]. Similarly, close patient-patient contact, visits to a contaminated common area, and transmission through a wandering, sick visitor are unlikely explanations in our setting [15]. Finally, high air velocities (>10 m/s), which can carry even large droplets beyond 2 m, were not found in our ward setting, and they would have been deposited too fast onto surfaces to account for the observed dispersal pattern [27, 28].",

However, accumulating evidences suggest that the aerosol route may have a contributing role [3, 13, 18, 19]. In animal models, influenza virus (eg, H3N2 or H1N1) has been shown to transmit efficiently through air, whereas fomite or contact spread is relatively inefficient [13, 18, 19, 32\u201334]. In clinical studies, virus- laden particles less than 5\u20136 \u00b5m (ie, within the respirable aerosol fraction) have been detected in exhaled breaths of patients with influenza and in the air sampled from an acute healthcare setting during seasonal peak [19, 35, 36]. In contrast to natural coughing or sneezing, artificially generated respiratory particles are often much smaller in size ( less than 5\u20136 mm), can penetrate more readily into the lower respiratory tract, and can cause infection with a smaller dose [3, 13, 18, 19]. It has been shown that certain clinical procedures (eg, endotracheal intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, noninvasive ventilation, and receipt of high-flow oxygen) can generate a large amount of respiratory aerosols [8, 9, 13, 16, 18, 29\u201331], and transmission of respiratory infection related to some of these procedures\u2014despite implementation of droplet precautions\u2014 has been reported [37\u201339].",

The policy of isolating or cohorting patients with suspected or confirmed influenza is reinforced; application of an aerosol-generating procedure is allowed only in adequately ventilated single rooms before influenza can be excluded; all patients with respiratory infections are required to wear face masks, which are freely provided, until symptoms subside; air-conditioning units and their settings are regularly checked to avoid airflow imbalance; and HCWs are advised to use N-95 respirators, face shields, gloves, and gowns while performing aerosol-generating procedures and to receive annual influenza vaccines [2, 5, 8, 9].We have adopted these measures on all medical wards, because there might be similar unsuspected or \u201cinvisible\u201d patients with influenza acting as infection sources. We did not encounter another influenza outbreak in open wards during the subsequent 24 month period, which included the first wave of the influenza H1N1 pandemic [7, 20]. Although each institute's infrastructure may be different, our findings suggest that the strategies of source and engineering controls might be important considerations to prevent nosocomial influenza transmission.",

We could not analyze the impact of influenza vaccination on the size of outbreak, because such information was unavailable from many patients; however, the general vaccine uptake rate in our community was reported to be very low [40, 41]. Also, we could not entirely eliminate the role of sick HCWs in transmitting infection, albeit no case of influenza was eventually confirmed among them. However, because all HCWs were required to wear surgical face mask during work and to report any influenza- like illnesses through a daily reporting system (the presence of which would immediately exempt them from duty), the chance of HCWs cross-infecting patients should be rather small [5]. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of cases could not be easily explained by HCW-to-patient or patient-to-patient transmission, as discussed above [15].",
