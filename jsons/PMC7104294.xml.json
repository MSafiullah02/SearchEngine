Schools, museums, cinemas, theatres, and any other social, recreational, or cultural centre must stay closed. Any gathering in public spaces is forbidden, including sporting events and funerals. Most shops must stay closed. Those selling essentials, such as supermarkets or pharmacies, need to ensure a distance of at least 1 m between customers.1\n",

Before March 5, when total deaths were 105, there was no description available of the characteristics of the deceased cases in Italy. Later data, still not including all deaths, revealed only one death in a patient under the age of 50 years,5 and 85\u00b75% of patients presenting with at least two pre-existing pathologies.6 While an open-access monitoring dashboard containing several essential indicators was created on March 8, no official Italian Government websites provide a full description of the characteristics (both age and comorbidities) of cases in the ICU, nor of those hospitalised, while unofficial and sometimes conflicting data are circulating in the media. Of the multitude of people tested for COVID-19 in Italy, as well as in other countries, it is not clear how many were asymptomatic versus symptomatic, and it is not clear whether a homogeneous criterion for testing has been applied. Data are lacking on the prevalence of the disease among asymptomatic populations, so the real prevalence of COVID-19, its spectrum of presentation, and the real mortality rate all remain unknown. Moreover, reported case fatality rates across countries are very heterogeneous, with Germany reporting very few fatalities compared with other European countries with similar populations and health systems that reported notably higher case fatality rates, thus suggesting a lack of uniform case definitions (table\n).",
