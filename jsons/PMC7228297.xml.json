WHO has expressed its fears that Pakistan is facing a major COVID\u201019 challenge. They mentioned that if effective measurements are not taken Pakistan might emerge as the next epicenter of this pandemic.\n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n It is believed that insufficient consideration is given to the basic infection control protocols including hand washing and personal protective equipment use in the educational and health care institutes of the country. The Ministry of Health, Pakistan has declared new guidelines for infection control which are based on the WHO recommendations.\n10\n However, the implementation of the basic infection control protocols is possible only when people and employees are made aware of the introduced policies by giving them clear guidelines. Awareness level and compliance of the educational and healthcare workers play an important role in the effective and timely prevention and control of a public health crisis.\n11\n To formulate a healthy policy, the multi\u2010disciplinary teams including key front\u2010line workers should be a part of the policy planning to ensure that these policies function effectively.\n12\n Pakistan faces many specific challenges about infection control that must be met by devising national policies.",

Questionnaires were filled by diverse groups of faculty, students, HCWs (physicians, nurses and lab staff). These questionnaires addressed access to information, training, confidence in the ability of faculty and HCWs to implement the introduced policies at their workplaces and asses the main threats which could lead to a possible public health crisis.

Feedback was taken based on their knowledge about COVID\u201019, its spread, and prevention and control measures implemented at their organizations. The questionnaire contained 21 different questions on basic knowledge of the infection, personal attitudes, and common practices during infection outbreak, control programs and policies, training and orientation conducted to bring awareness on origin, a common mode of transmission, signs, and symptoms.

The second question posed was regarding the origin of COVID\u201019, 82.45% of respondents said that they were aware of its origin, while 8.94% said that they did not know its origin, 8.61% of respondents were not sure whether they knew or not the origin of COVID\u201019. The highest uncertainty (50) about the origin of COVID\u201019 was found among the nurses. Based on professional awareness it was seen that 93.75% of physicians, 25% nurses, 100% lab technicians, and 81.61% of staff/students from educational institutions were aware of the origin of COVID\u201019.
