By one accounting, there are at least 1400 human pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, prions, protozoa, viruses, and worms, and of these, 100-150 appear capable of causing human epidemics.1, 2 Even this is likely to be an underestimate, as new and sensitive sequencing techniques continue to uncover new viruses at a steady rate.3 We human beings are remarkable in many ways, but why are we remarkable for playing host to so many infectious agents? Why is it that we must maintain high levels of vaccine coverage to prevent infectious agents from sickening or even killing large swaths of the population? The answers lie in the story of human disease epidemics, and it begins with human cultural and technological ascendance and what we now understand to be its inevitable consequences for pestilence and death. It is about our ingenuity, which has caused the retreat of many infectious diseases, but highlights a central tension in human existence\u2014immediate self-interest vs long-term collective welfare.4 The concept is not just academic; there are real-world implications that we can resolve with an understanding of human disease ecology. The notion is that we are not only culturally connected or genetically connected through a common ancestry. Rather, there is another fundamental concept that is, perhaps, not widely accepted or even understood. We are biologically connected, in the present, through our exchange of infectious agents and our common susceptibility to disease.",

Simultaneously, we domesticated animals and ourselves, and we sampled all of the viruses and bacteria existing in cows, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, and birds. Those that could replicate in human beings and spread from person to person by respiratory propulsion (or other means, such as fecal\u2013oral) became established evermore in the human population. This is the answer to why we are the most diseased species on earth. We are the only species to so profoundly and rapidly change the way in which we interact with each other and other animals; in other words, we invented for ourselves an entirely new ecosystem. So, in addition to the endless parade of cold viruses that circulate among us, we acquired a great many deadly infectious agents, such as those that cause diphtheria, influenza, measles, meningitis, mumps, plague, rubella, smallpox, typhus, whooping cough, and others.

What does the world look like in the face of measles?

The measles vaccine was licensed in 1963 and the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine was licensed in 1971. For the years between 1987 and 2000, the number dropped to 28 730 cases of measles in children younger than 5 years of age; 97 died, 43 contracted encephalitis, and 2480 contracted pneumonia. Since 1997, there has been less than 1 case per million population in the US.16 The global burden of measles in 1999 was an estimated 873 000 deaths that were reduced through a world-wide vaccination campaign to an estimated 164 000 deaths in 2008.17\n",

It took the idea of community out of the realm of philosophy and placed it as a fundamental property of life.

Below a certain threshold, the incidence of disease (frequency of new infections), even in unimmunized people, approaches zero. This is community protection, and it follows directly from basic epidemiology. Vaccination effectively reduces the number and density of the disease-susceptible people, making acutely infectious agents unsustainable in the population.22 Conversely, because vaccine protection is sometimes imperfect, a vaccinated individual living within a disease-susceptible population is at substantial risk. The risk of disease for any individual is thus most importantly dependent on the collective immunity of the population, especially those most susceptible to infection, usually the youngest children and oldest adults.",

In this case, each individual is defined narrowly in economic terms, acting as if he or she balances costs against benefits to maximize personal advantage. If most everyone cooperates (vaccinates), then everyone enjoys the benefits of being disease free. In contrast, the decision to cooperate may be perceived to have a cost, and individuals looking to maximize personal advantage will choose noncooperation at a certain probability. When no one is vaccinated and everyone is in danger, that probability is close to zero\u2014everyone is incentivized to vaccinate or risk the possibility of deadly disease. This must have been the dominant sentiment in the time of smallpox. As universal vaccination is approached, danger diminishes with or without vaccination, and the probability of noncooperation increases. For measles, the threshold for community protection is calculated to be 94.4%, that is, when 94.4% of the population has received 2 doses of MMR vaccine, the community is protected from disease.23 Under such conditions, some parents may decide not to vaccinate and thus avoid even very rare adverse effects. The consequence of this is that the rate of vaccination drops below the threshold, and the community is no longer protected. In other words, as we proceed toward elimination of a disease by vaccination, as we are for poliomyelitis, the invisible hand of the market pulls defeat from the jaws of victory. From this reasoning, elimination of a disease on a purely voluntary basis has been proposed to be unlikely, and the thought is that compliance to protect the population or eradicate a disease can only be achieved by a mandatory vaccination policy.24\n",

However, should we lapse in our vaccination vigilance, within one generation we could replay the disease devastation of the 16th century that included death of more than one-half of the native inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere.25 We are part of, what Watts and Strogatz called, a small-world network26\u2014with no more than 6 degrees of separation connecting the entire 7+ billion human beings on earth. Like the spread of Middle East respiratory syndrome from the Middle East to Korea, we can consummate those connections, wherever they may be, with a day's travel. A glimpse of a future with poor vaccine adherence occurred not too long ago, with an outbreak of measles originating in Anaheim, California. The infecting person (patient zero) almost certainly arrived from abroad, but most of the infected individuals were unvaccinated US residents.27\n",

Andrew Wakefield and 12 colleagues published an analysis of 12 children claiming to show a connection between MMR vaccination and the onset of a newly described \u201cpervasive developmental disorder\u201d that they summarized as a \u201cchronic enterocolitis in children that may be related to neuropsychiatric disorder.\u201d At face value, this is a tiny sample size with no controls. It linked 3 common conditions with MMR vaccination based on parent's recollections. Multiple large studies subsequently showed no such association, and the paper was retracted by 10 of the authors and by the journal after a prolonged study by the General Medical Council in the United Kingdom; however, it was not just a case of flawed science, it turned out to be fraud driven by avarice. In articles published by the British Medical Journal, the investigative journalist Brian Deer revealed how Wakefield had been hired to attack the MMR vaccine by a lawyer, Richard Barr. Wakefield and colleagues were paid to contrive the existence of a syndrome, he initially called, \u201cautistic enterocolitis\u201d for the express purpose of bringing a class action lawsuit against vaccine manufacturers; this occurred before initiation of the disgraced study.28 Another apparent moneymaking scheme was ironically to market vaccines. In a press conference given after the publication of his Lancet paper, Wakefield said he could not support the triple MMR vaccination and called for vaccination to each disease separately. He had previously patented a single measles vaccine. The British General Medical Council revoked his license to practice medicine, and he was asked to leave the Royal Free Hospital in London.",

For example, California Senate Bill No. 277, signed into law June 2015, requires vaccination for all children attending any public or private elementary or secondary school, childcare center, day nursery, nursery school, family daycare home, or development center. Exemptions for described medical conditions are permitted, but those based on personal or religious beliefs were to be phased out. Because California requires vaccination records for all schools, the effects of the bill could be tracked\u2014and the effects were dramatic. In 2014, more than 33% of school children lived in California counties with vaccination rates less than 90%, and 70% of children lived in counties with less than a 95% vaccination rate.30 Interestingly, the counties with the lowest rates of vaccination were of 2 types, rural counties largely located in the most northern part of the state and counties that include the tony urban communities surrounding San Francisco and Los Angeles.31 By 2016, more than 95% of children were from counties with greater than 95% vaccination. Nonetheless, the law only requires vaccination records for students as they enter each grade span (kindergarten, seventh grade, etc), and it recognizes personal exemptions previously on file. As such, there are still schools in which a single case of measles could spark a local epidemic.",

Another concern is that multiple vaccinations might \u201coverload\u201d the immune system, causing children to be more susceptible to unvaccinated diseases.
