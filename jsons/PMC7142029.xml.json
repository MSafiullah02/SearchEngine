In many patients, the main cause of infection cannot be identified based solely on the clinician\u2019s physical examination, especially in pediatric patients [2]. When infants who visit the emergency department exhibit fever without a clear source of infection, doctors must differentially diagnose various diseases from a simple viral infection to a serious bacterial infection [3]. The management of febrile infants aged <3 months is especially challenging because of the relatively high prevalence of serious bacterial infections such as bacteremia, meningitis, and urinary tract infection, and the lack of specific signs or symptoms to differentiate these infections from a simple viral infection [4,5]. A combination of medical history and physical and laboratory findings has been widely accepted as an approach to identify the source of infection in febrile patients [6].",

            "text": "Meningitis is one of the causes of fever, and lumbar puncture (LP) is required to determine the presence of meningitis by obtaining a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample. Making a decision of when to perform an LP to differentiate meningitis from other diseases can be difficult [7]. In early-onset sepsis in the neonatal period, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends performing an LP in the case of positive blood culture results, if the \u201cclinical course or laboratory data strongly suspect bacterial sepsis,\u201d or if the infant does not respond to antimicrobial therapy [8]. However, even with meningitis, young infant patients often do not present symptoms such as fever, vomiting, or headache, and blood culture examinations normally take a couple of days. Therefore, many clinicians rely on laboratory findings, including the level of C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute-phase reactant synthesized by the liver in response to tissue injury or inflammation, which is a sensitive marker for infection [9,10]. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published clinical guideline 149 (CG149) that suggests considering LP if the blood culture result is positive, the patient does not respond to antimicrobial therapy, or if the patient has a CRP level >10 mg/L [11]. Many studies have analyzed the diagnostic markers for serious bacterial infections in febrile infants, but markers indicating meningitis and the cut-off values for the diagnosis of meningitis have rarely been evaluated.",

Meningitis was defined as meningism without altered consciousness, with CSF WBC count \u22655/\u00b5L in infants older than 28 days and \u226530/\u00b5L in neonates [12]. Bacterial meningitis was confirmed based on the culture results of the CSF, Wellcogen (Remel Europe Ltd., Dartford, Kent, UK) bacterial antigen rapid latex agglutination test, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using dual priming oligonucleotide, Seeplex (MT Promedt Consulting GmbH, St. Ingbert, Germany). Viral meningitis was confirmed based on positive viral multiplex PCR results in the CSF. Aseptic meningitis was confirmed by negative bacterial growth in the CSF. For comparative analysis, we distinguished aseptic meningitis from viral meningitis. We confirmed that no bacterial pathogens were found in all investigated specimens from the aseptic or the viral meningitis groups. Undetermined fever was defined when the cause of fever was not revealed after 7 days of hospitalization. Urinary tract infection was diagnosed with pyuria (WBC >5/high power field) and the isolation of >100,000 colony-forming units per milliliter of a single pathogen from the urine collected in a urine bag. Cultures with more than one isolate were considered contaminated. Fever was defined as a tympanic membrane temperature of 38\u00b0C or higher.",

Particularly, febrile infants aged <3 months are frequently evaluated for the risk of invasive bacterial infections such as bacteremia or bacterial meningitis in the pediatric department [13,14]. The probability of serious bacterial infection without a definitive etiology is reported to be approximately 12% in the neonatal period and up to 9% between 1 and 3 months of age [15]. Diagnostic tests for differentiating severe bacterial infections from viral infections have long been the focus of several investigations [16]. Chest radiography has been used for diagnosing pneumonia. Urine and CSF samples have been used for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection and meningitis, respectively [17]. However, deciding the timing of LP for CSF sampling has been challenging [7]. For neonates with early-onset sepsis, the AAP recommends performing LP if the blood culture result is positive with clinical or laboratory findings strongly indicating bacterial sepsis or if the patients do not respond to antibiotic therapy [8]. Gajdos et al. [18] analyzed predictive factors of bacterial infection in febrile infants aged <3 months and found that only an elevation in WBC with >50% of neutrophils and an elevation in CRP levels >20 mg/L could predict serious bacterial infection, with a negative predictive value of 93%. Pulliam et al. [1] demonstrated that CRP level was a better diagnostic tool than WBC and ANC for predicting serious bacterial infection in a group of febrile children aged between 1 and 36 months.",

            "text": "During infection or inflammation, the plasma pro-calcitonin (PCT) concentration is known to both increase and return to normal concentration more rapidly than the CRP level [19]. The PCT level was also observed to increase faster than the CRP level 6 hours after the onset of severe infection or inflammation [20]. Therefore, the PCT test has been considered a useful tool for early diagnosis of infection [21]. In other studies, PCT was found to be a useful biomarker to distinguish between bacterial and viral meningitis [22]. Moreover, in Korea, several published studies have focused on the value of laboratory markers in discriminating serious bacterial infections, and Hur et al. [23] studied the diagnostic value of PCT and CRP simultaneously using blood samples from 1,270 patients with blood culture-positive sepsis. According to their report, the diagnostic utility of the PCT was better than that of CRP. However, in the case of diagnosing neonatal bacterial infection, the PCT test was found to be more expensive, with similar or better sensitivity than CRP and acceptable specificity [24]. Kim et al. [25] also reported that in febrile infants aged \u22646 months, there is no diagnostic value of measuring serum PCT concentration for determining bacterial infection. Since a PCT assay is more expensive than CRP level analysis and is not readily available in all facilities, only a few infants are analyzed for changes in the PCT level. In contrast, CRP can be determined in less than an hour using a small amount of blood and the CRP level test is not cost intensive. Hence, we determined a cut-off level for CRP for better diagnostic accuracy and ease of access to all patients.",

Our data also showed that different cut-off values of CRP levels had different diagnostic values (Table 3).

Second, we collected urine samples using urine bags rather than catheterization or bladder puncture, which could have increased the likelihood of contamination. Finally, a comparison between the bacterial meningitis group and the aseptic meningitis group could not be performed because there were only 3 cases of bacterial meningitis in this study cohort. Even with these limitations, this comparative analysis of laboratory markers for predicting meningitis in infants is significant in terms of its contribution to the literature.",
