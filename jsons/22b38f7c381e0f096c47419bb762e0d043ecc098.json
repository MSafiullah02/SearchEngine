The mental health response to the 9/ 11/01 terrorist attacks, culminating in a federally-funded health program, provides a template for how providers may serve affected individuals. Drawing on the 9/11 experience, we highlight effective prevention measures, likely short and long-term treatment needs, vulnerable subgroups, and important points of divergence between 9/11 and the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health monitoring, early identification of at-risk individuals, and treatment irrespective of financial barriers are essential for minimizing chronic distress.",

Many individuals may not make use of these short-term services, due to mental health stigma, denial, dissociative defenses, conflicting time demands, or general discomfort with emotional disclosure (particularly in group support/debriefing). Thus, individuals with the highest level of need may not engage when initial services are offered. The Mount Sinaibased mental health program for 9/11 responders lowered these barriers by partnering and co-locating with medical colleagues who were addressing 9/11 related physical health issues, and finding comparable integration will likely be essential to ensure COVID-19 related mental health programming reaches the greatest possible number of affected people.",

First, high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), clinical depression, and recurrent alcohol use problems are anticipated among healthcare workers, now on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, and serving as the most \"visible\" responder group during this crisis. Concerns have been raised around moral injury among healthcare workers given that hard choices may need to be made regarding rationing care, including ventilators (Williamson et al., 2020) . Moral injury has been associated with increased risk for psychiatric disorders and suicidal ideation (Bryan et al., 2018) . This issue recalls the identity conflicts faced by 9/ 11 uniformed responders: while trained to serve and protect others, many felt that they failed in this mission because so many people were killed and so few were rescued from the \"pile\" at Ground Zero. Just world assumptions were shattered then, as they likely will be for medical personnel now.",

This concern arises from striking parallels to the 9/11 experience. Non-traditional 9/11 responders (e.g. construction, cleanup, asbestos workers; city employees; and volunteers) have consistently higher rates of chronic PTSD than uniformed responders (e.g. police), potentially related to having greater pre and post-9/11 life stressors, higher rates of pre-9/11 psychiatric diagnoses, and lower social support around the time of 9/11 (Pietrzak et al., 2014) . Further, this group mostly lacked disaster response experience and found themselves taking on tasks well outside the scope of their jobs, often not by choice but due to economic necessity.",

Despite the many similarities between 9/11 and the COVID-19 pandemic, they must be seen through the lens of differences between two events, differences which suggest the possibility of even greater psychiatric fallout for the pandemic's responders. First, while the daily exposure of responders at Ground Zero took place over months, the acute impact proved to be more or less limited to 9/11/01 itself whereas the acute impact of COVID-19 is unfolding over at least months. Second, the militaristic conceptualization of the COVID-19 response as a \"war\" wherein healthcare professionals have been \"(re)deployed\" to work with COVID-19 patients underscores how obligation and immediate personal jeopardy may color this response far more than 9/11 ultimately did. Third, to the extent that problematic pre-disaster psychosocial circumstances are a risk factor for survivors' future risk of psychopathology, the heightened levels of political and social discord in the United States and elsewhere in the last several years is of concern.",

The tremendous loss of life will invariably lead to adverse mental health effects in the population, including family members of victims, health workers who tried valiantly to save the ill, and other essential personnel who continued to serve the public in the face of ongoing invisible life threat. Rather than the sudden jolt of fear and horror that accompanied the 9/ 11 attacks, the COVID-19 pandemic will likely bring a more insidious wave of anxiety, anger, and grief as casualties increase. Widely-accessible short and long-term mental health treatment services, such as those provided following 9/11, may prove necessary to respond to this need. ",
