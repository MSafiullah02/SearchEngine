The congress welcomed lectures discussing time-tested wisdom, updates in the management of complex situations, as well as innovative strategies and other contemporary topics. The dynamism of the field was underlined by over 100 posters submitted and presenting early stage research, clinical innovations, and reports of rare cases. The Congress and its Masterclass in Colorectal Surgery (#ECCStGallen) were granted 26 CME/CPD credits by the Swiss Society of Surgery, the nVnH/Dutch Colorectal Society and by the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland. Overall, 46 Expert lectures were given at another successful #ColorectalSurgeryWeek. The #ECCStGallen 2019 was further endorsed by the Swiss Association of Minimal Invasive Surgery (Swiss-MIS), the European Association of Endoscopic Surgery (EAES), and the European Crohn\u2019s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO). The full program of #ECCStGallen 2019 can be found on the congress website www.colorectalsurgery.eu.",

Technical points and controversies regarding transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME), complete mesocolic excision (CME), and lateral lymph node dissection were thoroughly addressed by leading experts Roel Hompes (Fig. 3), Paris Tekkis, and Peter Sagar, who shared their views and practice recommendations. Andr\u00e9 d\u2019Hoore reported his experience in construction and salvage of colorectal anastomosis, including the most recent developments in anastomosis techniques in inflammatory bowel disease. Ronan O\u2019Connell then discussed the timing of rectal cancer surgery following neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy in light of the growing literature. Last but not least, recent publications that have the potential to change and improve practice were discussed by Neil Mortensen, one of the giants of colorectal surgery.",

We were fortunate to have Robin Spiller, an expert gastroenterologist with a focus on the pathophysiology of functional diseases and the role of infection and inflammation, to discuss etiology and non-operative management. Atypical diverticulitis was then addressed by Dieter Hahnloser, while Willem Bemelman emphasized the disruptive and progressive shift away from Hartmann\u2019s procedure in most emergency situations and the selective use of laparoscopic lavage, including purulent and fecal peritonitis. Broader adoption of primary resection and anastomosis, eventually associated with protective ileostomy, was thus supported in a talk thoroughly documented by an extensive literature review of the most recent trials [1]. Hartmann's procedure reversal can indeed lead to difficult operative situations and Roel Hompes detailed the technical options at hand. He underlined the improved outcomes of minimally invasive approaches, in particular the benefit of a transanal approach when facing a short rectal stump, while he underlined the meticulous preoperative planning required in considering these options.",

Conversely, objective arguments to help the decision-making process in colorectal surgery are more abundant than ever before. The presentation of a treatment algorithm for volvulus of the colon by Peter Sagar illustrated well the many options facing a clinician in everyday practice.

Yet, the data available did not allow a firm conclusion, although ergonomic benefits for the surgeon were evident. Paris Tekkis then spoke about robotic multivisceral resections in locally advanced rectal cancer, which could expand the possibilities of minimally invasive resections in patients historically considered only for an open approach. Finally, Vic Verwaal, who has published randomized trials on cytoreductive surgery both in colorectal and ovarian cancers, summarized the lessons learned in two decades of practicing hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.",

In 1\u2032052 patients, it resulted in histological downstaging and 50% reduction of incomplete resections, thus opening the way to a new approach in the armamentarium against advanced colon cancer. Of course, one of the main limitations of this approach is its non-applicability to obstructive colon cancer, which still accounts for a significant proportion of colon cancers. Discussing this clinical situation, Neil Mortensen\u2019s after lunch lecture\u2014 \u201cRush to the OR or stent and dine?\u201d\u2014showed that stents in obstructive colon cancer should be broadly considered, both as a bridge to curative surgery or as a palliative option with minimal impact on quality of life. With an obstruction relief rate of 82%, low complication and low stoma rates, and no oncological downsides, his thorough review advocates that surgeons to skip dinner less often.",

Innovative predictors of good surgical response were identified, such as microbiome modifications and response to the newest medical treatment. These variables impact the course of the disease and may be combined with established predictors into a decisional algorithm to individualize surgical approaches to Crohn\u2019s disease. Tailored care was also at the heart of the discussion on how to handle dysplasia in IBD, presented by Janindra Warusavitarne, who devotes his practice exclusively to IBD patients. Justin Davies then gave a broad review of state-of-the-art practice in perianal Crohn\u2019s disease, emphasizing the importance of appropriate and immediate surgical care, including when necessary, a defunctionalizing stoma. Finally, Gerhard Rogler demonstrated the high potential of mesenchymal stem cell therapy which can achieve a 50% remission rate, that can rise to 67% when associated with anti-TNF treatment [4].",

Through the prospective GOSAFE study [6] reporting 504 unselected elderly patients undergoing major oncologic surgery, he showed that one-third of these patients suffered functional decline 90 days after successful surgery. Functional decline correlated strongly with preoperative frailty evaluation, so that he advocated for a change in clinical practice, namely a systematic evaluation of frailty and a focus in the frail on quality of life improvement and functional recovery over classical oncologic outcomes.",
