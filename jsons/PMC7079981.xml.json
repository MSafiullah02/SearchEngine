There is clear evidence that GBV-C is transmitted by sexual and percutaneous routes and is frequently found in populations at risk for blood-borne or sexually transmitted viruses. Thus, GBV-C is more frequently detected in groups at higher risk for hepatitis infection by similar routes of transmission and in patients treated with multiple haemodialysis procedures and a high number of transfused blood product units [1]. GBV-C prevalence among patients with HIV mono-infection varies from 14 to 43 %, depending on the population studied [2].",

These results were subsequently confirmed by this group and other research groups [6, 7]. Although the results were not always clearly significant [8], a meta-analysis underlined GBV-C\u2019s association with a beneficial effect of the course of the disease [9, 10]. Although there are currently no commercial systems for detecting specific markers of GBV-C infection, active GBV-C infection has been detected by RT-PCR [11], while past infection has been detected by the presence of anti-E2 antibodies [12] using an ELISA assay involving the E2 recombinant protein. The development of an anti-E2 detection method has led to a complete definition of the prevalence of GBV-C since E2 antibodies are several times more frequently detectable than RNA in blood donors [13]. Although the appearance of anti-E2 antibodies is considered to be an indication of past infection, and detection of these antibodies and the active presence of GBV-C [14] are unlikely to be concomitant, recent literature provides descriptions of results that feature duality in terms of the positive presence of anti-E2 antibodies and the presence of viral RNA [15].",

In particular, HCV-co-infected patients receiving interferon therapy are able to eliminate the virus without the development of anti-E2 antibodies. Thus, the elimination of the infection without antibodies against the E2 protein has raised questions about the usefulness of E2 antibodies as a marker of past GBV-C infection among HIV and HIV\u2013HCV-co-infected patients. The abovementioned results point to the need for further studies on the development of the antibodies in order to develop an understanding of the effect of exposure to GBV-C on human health in the context of other viral infections.",

The main interest in array technology lies in the capacity to analyse a large number of molecules in one single experiment. More specifically, the protein or peptide microarrays allow for the analysis of large-scale, high-sensitivity protein\u2013protein interactions, making them a very attractive technique in proteomic studies in search of biomarkers, in the screening of new drugs and in disease diagnosis trials [18, 19]. In fact, the use of microarrays has emerged as a very promising diagnostic tool in medicine. In particular, peptide microarrays have been used in both autoimmune and allergic human diseases. Therefore, immunoenzymatic peptide assays have been designed for the diagnosis of the human herpes and corona viruses [20] and to identify different serum profiles in rheumatoid arthritis [21].",

Eleven specific IgG surface-binding epitopes on the E2 GBV-C protein were identified. Peptide antigen microarrays were then constructed using the identified E2-binding epitopes for serum detection of IgG in GBV-C infection.

The pattern of each serum is a description of the peptides selected in which the median fluorescence value of the serum was greater than or equal to the corresponding cut-off (P##CO; Table 2). Thus, taking into account the number of P##CO in each pattern, we defined a serum as anti-E2 GBV-C antibody positive when the pattern included at least six peptides. Moreover, the three antigenic zones previously identified had to appear within these patterns in their entirety, and we therefore ensured that at least one peptide from each zone was also present in a pattern for a serum to be considered anti-E2 GBV-C antibody positive (Table 3). These patterns demonstrate that patient serum shows reactivity against different peptides, which on their own are less specific markers for GBV-C infection than when combined. The creation of these patterns is important for the improvement of diagnostic accuracy with a combined set of peptides. Thus, peptide microarray technology can help establish reliable diagnostic biomarkers by employing a combination of antigenic peptides.\n\n",
