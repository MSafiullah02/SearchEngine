These VFs provide a physical scaffold that brings together elements required for genome replication and morphogenesis 1, 7. VFs are usually formed by rearranging the host's cell membranes, reorganizing the cytoskeleton and recruiting specific organelles, like mitochondria (reviewed in 8). These viral driven events involve the association of replication complexes (RCs) with ER derived membranes to form a VF. Hence, intracellular membrane dynamics appear to be crucial for viral replication and survival.",

Similarly, the RCs of Togaviruses associate with endocytic membranes, while Nodavirus RCs associate with mitochondrial membranes (reviewed in 1). Thus, specific membrane compartments can be used as VFs by RNA viruses to concentrate viral replicases and key cofactors, and ensure efficient viral genome replication 10. In this context, both rubella virus (RUBV), a relevant human teratogenic Togaviridae virus 11, and Semliki forest virus (SFV), a member of the Alphavirus group of this family 12, couple their RNA synthesis to endosome and lysosome membranes modified by the association of virus specific components. The subsequent fusion of these late endosomes and lysosomes generates cytopathic vacuoles (CPVs) 13, 14 that are lined with small vesicular invaginations or spherules (viral RNA replication sites) 13, 14. CPVs establish complex and reversible contact with endocytotic vesicles through internal membranes interconnected with transport endosomes 8. For example RUBV forms VFs around CPVs via the recruitment of membrane structures from the ER cisternae, Golgi stacks and mitochondria 8 (Figure 1). The Golgi apparatus is a highly dynamic organelle with a sustained, functional flux of membrane proteins 15, and it can serve as a morphogenic mould for Rubiviruses, Coronaviruses, Arteriviruses and Bunyaviruses 1, 8, 16, 17. These RUBV factories connect viral replication with the assembly and maturation of nascent virions at Golgi membranes, contributing to the virus escaping from the host cell's defences 16.",

The RNA polymerase of the human poliovirus, a Picornaviridae family member responsible for poliomyelitis, can also assemble DMVs 22. Infection by this virus triggers the modification of different intracellular membrane structures and organelles (but not mitochondria), converting them into virus replication vesicles. In fact, poliovirus\u2010associated DMVs resemble autophagosomes, as also described for another Picornaviridae family member, Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3 23, 24: Figure 1). Autophagosomes are DMVs generated by membrane trafficking and they are related to the catabolic process of autophagy, which involves the degradation of cytoplasmic components within lysosomes 25, 26. Autophagy maintains the organism's homeostasis by sequestering undesired intracellular elements for lysosomal degradation and recycling 25, 26. Viruses often use autophagy to complete their lifecycle and evade immune responses, even though it is based on catalytic pathways 3, 23, 24. Poliovirus, like other positive RNA viruses, has evolved the capacity to convert autophagy into a key cellular motor for replication 3, 10, 23. During autophagy, a cytosolic form of the microtubule\u2010associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3\u2010I) conjugates with phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3\u2010II and associate with autophagosomal membranes, ultimately producing the degradation of LC3\u2010II during the late steps of autophagy 27. Conversely, the p62 protein (or sequestosome\u20101, SQSTM1) interacts with ubiquitinated proteins, LC3 and other proteins to ensure the correct degradation of undesired material. LC3\u2010II augments during active autophagy when p62 is degraded 28, 29. In this context, Poliovirus or CVB3 infection triggers the generation of autophagosomes with a higher LC3\u2010II/LC3\u2010I ratio and with LC3 foci, structures that support the RNA RC without promoting lysosome degradation (evident through p62 stabilization 23, 24: Figure 1). However, it is unclear whether these viruses block autophagosome maturation into amphisomes, avoiding autophagosome fusion with endosomes 30. Such events override the appearance of degradative autolysosomes 31 or they may provoke the formation of autophagosome\u2010like structures disconnected from catalytic pathways. It is also thought that these autophagosomes may ultimately serve as a membrane scaffold to permit the egression of nascent virions from infected cells, preventing cell lysis 30 (Figure 1).",

This involves regulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which relieves ER stress and prevents the formation of catalytic autolysosomes by suppressing their fusion with lysosomes 33, 34 (Figure 1). Apparently, the success of viral replication relies on the recruitment of membrane\u2010trafficking proteins to ER\u2010derived membrane scaffolds 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41. Hence, domain 1 of the non\u2010structural 5A (NS5A) protein and the helicase domain of NS3 are sufficient to achieve efficient DMV formation, which also depends on tightly regulated cis cleavage of the HCV\u2010polyprotein precursor 35 and requires cyclophilin A isomerase activity 36. NS5A associates with NS5B, a RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase, a complex that interacts with VAMP (vesicle\u2010associated membrane protein)\u2010associated proteins (VAPs) 37, 38 and recruits Ras\u2010like small GTPases (e.g. Rab1, Rab5 and Rab7), enlarging the viral replication compartment by docking membrane vesicles 39, 40, 41. This process also regulates autophagy 42, given that HCV\u2010induced autophagosomes support viral replication and the delivery of incoming viral RNA to the translation apparatus, and/or the recruitment of cellular factors for translation. However, some controversy still surrounds this issue, autophagosomes can mature into acidic amphisomes in HCV\u2010infected cells 43, 44, and subsequently fuse with late endosomes or lysosomes 44 (Figure 1). Autophagic membrane flux appears to be necessary to translate the HCV genome, yet it appears to be dispensable once viral infection has begun 45. Moreover, no changes in either p62 or the degradation of long\u2010lived proteins are observed 33, despite the enhanced autolysosome formation in cells expressing HCV replicons 46. While specific silencing of autophagy genes does not affect viral translation and RNA replication, it does apparently alter HCV morphogenesis 47. However, the silencing of factors critical for autophagosomes formation, like LC3 or Atg7, appears to suppress HCV RNA replication 48, while HCV replication is apparently potentiated when the UPR promotes autophagy 49. Conversely, HCV infection seems to promote autophagy without concomitant stimulation of the UPR and autophagy does not appear to be required as a platform for HCV RNA replication 50. Thus, doubts remain about the role of autophagy and the UPR in HCV replication, although the distinct interactions between autophagy and HCV replication suggest that such membrane flux promotes viral replication.",

            "text": "The dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito\u2010borne single positive\u2010stranded RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family that causes dengue fever 51. There are five antigenically related but distinct DENV virus genotypes (DENV\u20101 to DENV\u20105) 51, 52. Like HCV, there is evidence that autophagy may be implicated in DENV replication. Following cell entry and nucleocapsid uncoating, DENV RNA is translated into a single polyprotein that passes into the ER lumen where the different viral proteins are processed. In fact, DENV\u20102 proteins involved in translation and replication are found in or in close proximity to autophagosomes during viral infection 53, 54. Accordingly, inhibition of autophagosome formation dampens the production of infectious DENV\u20102 particles 53, while stabilizing autophagosomes and/or amphisomes by impeding their fusion with lysosomes enhances viral egression 55. Indeed, DENV\u20103 seems to promote autophagy during early infection 54, while inhibition of autophagosome formation also dampens the production of infectious DENV\u20103 54. Hence, DENV\u20102 and \u20103 appear to interact with the autophagy machinery in a different manner, and while it is conceivable that amphisomes or autophagosomes represent the site of DENV\u20102 translation/replication 54, 55, autophagolysosomes could be the crucial site for DENV\u20103 viral replication 54. The distribution of NS1 or DENV\u20102 and DENV\u20103 double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the different autophagy\u2010associated membrane structures confirms these observations (Figure 1). Moreover, nascent viral particles are formed and mature in these structures, then travelling through the trans\u2010Golgi network (TGN) to egress 56, 57. Remarkably, the precursor membrane (prM) protein of the DENV\u20101\u20134 genotypes behaves similarly and it is cleaved by the TGN\u2010protease furin in the secretory pathway 58, assuring viral assembly and the infectivity of nascent viral particles 59.",

            "text": "HIV is a single\u2010stranded RNA virus (Lentivirus genus of the Retroviridae family) that causes AIDS. HIV type 1 (HIV\u20101) alters the autophagic membrane flux of the host cell's organelles, thereby modulating the intracellular milieu in favour of viral replication and propagation 3 (Figure 1). When CD4+ T cells, monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) are infected with HIV\u20101, autophagic vacuole formation is blocked and the expression of autophagy proteins down\u2010regulated (e.g. LC3 and Beclin1 19, 60: Figure 1). Remarkably, the HIV\u20101 protein Nef (negative factor) blocks the autophagic flux of membranes, especially during the autolysosome stage of autophagy, resulting in an accumulation of autophagosomes and LC3 in macrophages (Figure 1). Thus, Nef prevents autophagic degradation of HIV\u20101 biosynthetic intermediates of virions by targeting the lipid class III phosphatidylinositol 3\u2010kinase (C3\u2010PI3K) complex and by associating with Beclin1 (Atg6\u2014autophagy\u2010related protein 6\u2014in yeast). Significantly, Beclin1 is actually part of the C3\u2010PI3K complex, together with the vacuolar protein sorting\u2010associated proteins 34 (Vps34) and 15 (p150). Nef therefore alters the sub\u2010cellular distribution of Vps34, potentially ensuring the survival of the viral progeny 3, 61. Indeed, Nef is thought to promote the appropriate HIV\u20101 Gag membrane localization and processing, thereby facilitating viral cell\u2010to\u2010cell transfer 62. Although the catalytic activity of autophagy appears to be impeded by HIV\u20101, autophagosome formation or accumulation is still promoted. Hence, the HIV\u20101 Gag protein promotes early stages of autophagosome formation by directly interacting with LC3 in macrophages, enhancing HIV\u20101 yields and Gag processing, a critical step in virion assembly and release 61 (Figure 1). Notably, newly identified components of the ubiquitin\u2010like conjugation system all seem to be involved in HIV\u20101 replication (e.g. Atg7, Atg8\u2014LC3 is its best characterized mammalian homologue\u2014Atg12 and Atg16L2\u2014responsible for vesicle elongation) 63. However, it remains unclear how these factors actually affect HIV\u20101 replication, which occurs in the nucleus of infected cells. Moreover, while autophagic vacuoles would appear to be fundamental for HIV\u20101 morphogenesis and egression, how HIV\u20101 overrides or uses autophagy to persist remains poorly understood. Hence, the infectious capacity of nascent HIV\u20101 virions depends on the uptake of the viral infectivity factor (Vif) during viral budding, a process influenced by histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), which promotes autophagic clearance of Vif 64. Other positive RNA viruses exploit the formation of ER\u2010derived membrane scaffolds and membrane autophagic flux to replicate (e.g. the Norwalk virus), because the membrane\u2010bound nsp48 protein also binds to VAP\u2010A 65.",

Giant viruses (also called nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses\u2014CLDVs) belonging to this order are double\u2010stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses with a genome and particle size comparable to those of small bacteria 74. African swine fever virus (ASFV; from the Asfarviridae family), poxviruses and iridoviruses are the three families of NCLDVs that terminate or undergo their entire replication cycle in the cytoplasm 75, 76, 77. This feature is not observed in herpes viruses or baculoviruses, other large DNA viruses of eukaryotes that undergo nuclear DNA replication and transcription 78. Giant viruses provoke VF formation in the cytoplasm of infected cells to permit genome replication and morphogenesis 73, 79. ASFV factories are similar to the aggresomes formed at the MTOC (microtubule organizing centre) 80, and they provoke a re\u2010arrangement of the intermediate vimentin cytoskeleton at the MTOC into a star shaped structure that resembles the microtubule aster formed during mitosis, a structure required for late gene expression 81. Together with an ASFV chaperone, the hsp70 cell chaperone is recruited to ASFV factories, along with mitochondria, facilitating the folding of viral structural proteins like the major capsid protein p72 82, 83. Nascent ASFV virions are formed from VF membranes through the assembly and recruitment of viral proteins in VFs. Thus, the viral membranes in VFs may be connected to cellular organelles, particularly given that resident ER markers are detected with the viral p17, p54 and pB318L proteins in new viral particles 84, 85, 86, 87. ASFVs are thought to reorganize cell membranes through viral proteins that contain a KDE motif, inducing the redistribution of ER\u2010associated proteins 88 and the viral p54 protein. The latter is required for the correct VF localization of the membranes and the collapse of the ER\u2010derived cisternae 89. ASFV infection is achieved by redistributing membranes from the secretory pathway and TGN 90. Therefore, these common biological features of giant virus replication and virion architecture could reflect a common origin, and the sharing of a large set of ancestral genes 74, 91.",

The structural Gag polyprotein is common to several retroviruses, like HIV\u20101 and the murine leukaemia virus (MLV), representing the minimal plasma membrane component required for viral assembly 92. HIV\u20101 Gag localizes to phosphatidylinositol\u20104,5\u2010bisphosphate (PIP2) rich plasma membrane regions, where PIP2 plays a critical role in HIV\u20101 virion assembly 93 (Figures 1 and 2). In fact, the matrix viral protein (MA) within the unprocessed HIV\u20101 Gag polypeptide drives Gag towards these PIP2 membrane domains 92, 94 in a myristoylation\u2010dependent manner 95, raft domains where HIV\u20101 buds 95, 96, 97. Phosphate hydrolysis by polyphosphoinositide 5\u2010phosphatase IV (5ptaseIV) diminishes the plasma membrane PIP2\n98, causing the Gag polypeptide to translocate from HIV\u20101 budding sites at the membrane to CD63 rich compartments, thereby inhibiting viral release 93. Similarly, Arf6/Q67L expression, a GTP\u2010bound mutant of Arf6, alters the trafficking of Arf6/PIP2\u2010associated vesicles, provoking their accumulation in the cytoplasm to where Gag is redirected. These complexes lie far from the budding sites at the membrane, thereby dampening virus release 93. Although the assembly of HIV\u20101 at the cell surface is only partially understood, several key steps in the membrane trafficking of viral proteins have been defined, shedding light on both the viral assembly and budding processes 92, 99.",

In addition, MVBs are important intermediates in endolysosomal transport 102 (Figures 1 and 2). Gag activity drives ESCRT\u2010III complex formation at the budding site of HIV\u20101, which binds to and recruits the ESCRT\u2010I complex and the ALG\u20102 (apoptosis\u2010linked gene 2)\u2010interacting protein X (ALIX). This ESCRT\u2010III complex promotes the excision of nascent virions at the cell surface, an event potentially equivalent to the cleavage of intraluminal vesicles from MVBs 103, 104 (Figures 1 and 2). Moreover, the tumour susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101) is a subunit of the ESCRT\u2010I complex that drives viral RNA transport and envelope fusion to late endosomes, processes required for infection and RNA release 105 (Figure 2). However, the interaction of viral Gag protein with the ESCRT machinery appears not to be absolutely required for HIV\u20101 viral budding 106, 107, 108.

Thus, it involves pathways that regulate cell\u2010free virus entry by modifying membrane dynamics. In this regard, most HIV\u20101\u2010infected GALT (gut\u2010associated lymphoid tissue) cells in intestinal crypts are infected by concentrated pools of free HIV\u20101 viral particles in HIV\u20101\u2010infected humanized mice. Fewer infected cells are found in the mucosal regions and the lamina propria, where VS presumably occur 130, explaining why infection of permissive cells by free viral particles is crucial for HIV\u20101 replication and pathogenesis in vivo. This is consistent with the recent identification of the key cell signals required for efficient early HIV\u20101 infection and the establishment of latency in CD4+ T cells 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136. Interference with retroviral cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission is not only produced by blocking cytoskeletal motility 137 and depleting membrane\u2010cholesterol 138 but also, by interfering with Arf6\u2010governed plasma membrane dynamics.

The flux and turnover of PIP2\u2010enriched vesicles from the plasma membrane, driven and coordinated by the Arf6\u2010GTP/GDP cycle, ensures cell surface membrane regeneration and it allows membrane exchange between the viral and target cell surfaces. This type of membrane trafficking, coupled with enhanced fluidity, is in strong synergy with the key HIV\u20101/receptor (CD4 and C\u2013X\u2013C or C\u2013C chemokine receptor type 4 or 5\u2014CXCR4 or CCR5), interactions that promote fusion pore formation in target cells. These interactions take place between the non\u2010regenerative HIV\u20101 viral membrane and the dynamic cell surface membrane, favouring efficient virus\u2013cell fusion, entry and infection, both for the free virus and in the context of the VS 4, 133, 135 (Figures 1 and 2).",

Conversely, it is not clear why viruses replicate in different subcellular membrane compartments, how they move across membranes and which host factors are involved in these events. Similarly, we still do not know how these changes in membrane dynamics enable viruses to avoid immune responses. Indeed, it remains unclear whether rearranging intracellular organelles enables viruses to escape the anti\u2010replicative activity of natural restriction factors, such as apolipoprotein B mRNA\u2010editing enzyme\u2010catalytic, polypeptide\u2010like 3 (APOBEC3) proteins, Tetherin (BST\u20102/CD317/HM1.24) or SAMHD1 (sterile alpha motif (SAM) and histidine\u2010aspartate (HD) domain\u2010containing protein 1) for HIV\u20101 149.

Viral proteins can enter secretory pathways by co\u2010translational translocation into the ER in order for them to be further transported to the Golgi complex, either in vesicles or in a coatomer protein complex (COP) II\u2010dependent manner. Viral complexes formed inside the VFs communicate with vesicles, mitochondria, Golgi cisternae and ER membranes. This interaction allows viral complexes to be transported through the Golgi network to the plasma membrane and it promotes their final release as viral particles. Alternatively, some viruses take advantage of the host's autophagic machinery for their own replication and pathogenesis. Viruses first initiate the formation of vesicles that bear key autophagic proteins, such as Beclin\u20101 and LC3, capturing portions of membranes from the ER and other cytoplasmic elements. This assembly evolves toward an immature double\u2010membrane vesicle (DMV) that serves as an aggresome compartment to recruit viruses or newly formed viral replication complexes. Several RNA viruses induce the formation of these autophagosome\u2010like vesicles (also referred to as DMVs) to enhance viral replication and non\u2010lytic egression, such as poliovirus and CVB3, HIV\u20101 and HCV. How these viruses trigger the accumulation of autophagosome\u2010like vesicles and DMVs remains unclear. Some theories involve blocking the fusion of nascent autophagosomes with late endosomes and lysosomes, as in the case of HIV\u20101 Nef, which appears to cause autophagosome accumulation by inhibiting their progression towards more mature stages. Indeed, autophagosome\u2010like vesicles may represent a trafficking pathway for these viruses, connecting to multivesicular bodies (MVBs), and assuring virus assembly and budding at the cell surface while protecting them from intrinsic antiviral factors and immune responses. The morphogenesis and release of mature and infectious HBV particles also require Tsg101 and depend on the ESCRT\u2010MVB system. Under standard conditions the lumen of autophagosomes acidifies after fusion with endosomes that carry vacuolar (H+)\u2010ATPase (V\u2010ATPase) to form amphisomes. The autophagic membrane flux progresses by fusing with lysosomes in order to form the autolysosome that contains the former's proteinases. Poliovirus inhibition of autophagosome formation attenuates viral replication while inhibiting autolysosome formation, and thus, catalytic activity does not affect the virus. However, degradation of cellular triglycerides by autophagy benefits DENV replication and autolysosome degradation dampens IFN activation following HCV infection",

            "text": "Figure 2: Virological synapse and spreading. At the virological synapse (VS), some viruses attach structural polyproteins to PIP2\u2010rich membrane regions of the infected cell for further budding and release into the intercellular space. PIP2 confers fluidity to the cell membrane and favours virus\u2013cell fusion. These virions then bind to specific receptors in order to infect the neighbouring target cell at the VS, fusing with its plasma membrane directly or after surfing on actin\u2010structured filopodia, or being internalized by endocytosis as is believed to occur with HIV\u20101. The VS represents an efficient environment for viral budding. It typically arises in PIP2\u2010enriched plasma membrane domains, where the membrane of the infected cell is polarized towards the synaptic junction through the movement of vesicles governed by the ESCRT/Alix\u2010Tsg101 machinery or by MVBs coordinating the translocation of the MTOC. This scaffolding facilitates subsequent viral infection and spread from the infected to the nearby uninfected cell. In addition, long membrane nanotubes may also form between neighbouring cells, promoting viral protein trafficking. Other dynamic membrane events involved in viral infection and spreading are trogocytosis, Arf6/PIP2\u2010mediated membrane dynamics and exosomal transport. Trogocytosis involves the exchange of cell surface membrane patches that may contain receptor clusters associated to viral particles, while exosomes are vesicles formed from MVBs that could participate in viral infection and spreading between cells",
