            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been identified as a novel pathogen causing human respiratory infections since 2012 [1] . Most MERS patients presented with viral pneumonia, and some of them developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure with a case-fatality rate over 30% [2] . Cytological examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from MERS patients exhibited large numbers of neutrophils and macrophages, indicating a massive pulmonary inflammation [3] . The postmortem study of a MERS patient revealed compatible pathological changes, including edematous alveolar septa with infiltration of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages, as well as diffuse alveolar damage [4] . A detailed examination of lung tissues of MERS-CoV-infected nonhuman primates including common marmosets and Rhesus macaques revealed similar pathological changes, reminiscent of prominent lung disease in severe MERS patients. Thus, the authors reached a central conclusion that robust viral replication, together with an intense local immune response to MERS-CoV infection, may result in severe respiratory disease in these experimental animals [5] .",

Macrophages sense and recognize invading pathogens or endogenous ligands through a broad range of sensors, and they generally elicit effective clearance via phagocytosis. On the other hand, macrophages may fail to eliminate invading microbes. Instead, they become inappropriately activated and initiate dysregulated inflammatory responses in some cases [6, 7] . We have previously reported that MERS-CoV productively infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and triggered aberrant proinflammatory response [8] , providing direct evidence to explain the massive inflammation observed in severe MERS patients and experimentally infected nonhuman primates.",

Ding et al [14] demonstrated the RLR-mediated signaling for nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB activation in transmissible gastroenteritis virus infection. Zalinger et al [15] elucidated the importance of MDA5 to host defense during murine CoV infection. Meanwhile, CLR signaling has shown the increasing importance for triggering inflammatory response upon viral infections [16, 17] . The transcription factor NF-\u03baB is an essential mediator of inducible gene expression of cytokines and chemokines. CLR induced signal transduction seems to mainly activate and modulate NF-\u03baB functions [17, 18] . The mechanisms by which CoVs evade host innate antiviral response, including MERS-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, have been extensively investigated [19] [20] [21] . However, it is poorly understood how the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV triggers the aberrant proinflammatory response, one of the pathological bases of severe respiratory diseases in MERS patients and experimentally infected animals. In this study, we sought to elucidate the contribution of RLR and CLR signaling pathway for mediating the exuberant inflammatory responses in macrophages upon MERS-CoV infection.",

Consistent with our previous observation, MERS-CoV infection globally stimulated an array of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines including interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1, RANTES, IFN-\u03b3, and IP-10 [8] . The induction of cytokine and/or chemokine was dependent on viral replication because the inoculation of the UV-inactivated viruses was unable to trigger these inflammatory mediators, except RANTES (Supplementary Figure 2) . It is notable that MERS-CoV-mediated induction of TNF-\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IP-10 was generally diminished in the presence of Amlexanox and R406, although Amlexanox treatment only marginally reduced TNF-\u03b1 production. In addition, the treatment of Amlexanox, but not R406, significantly attenuated the induction of IL-6 and RANTES. However, NLR signaling inhibitor VX-765 seemed to have minimal effect on these inflammatory mediators. Because the replication of MERS-CoV is the driving force for the induction of most cytokines and/or chemokines, we evaluated the viral replication in the presence of the inhibitors. It was shown that the addition of these inhibitors did not affect viral replication (Supplementary Figure 3) .",

Thus, we measured the mRNA profiles of RLRs and myeloid CLRs in MERS-CoV-infected macrophages. As shown in Figure 2A , the mRNA expression levels of RLRs including RIG-I, MDA5, and LPG2, as well as CLRs Mincle and Dectin-2 were significantly upregulated at 24 hpi. The positive modulation pattern of RLR and CLR, especially the increased expression of RIG-I and Mincle, was manifested as early as 6 hpi ( Figure 2B ), suggesting an accelerating activation of these PRRs during MERS-CoV infection. Overall, the above results suggested that RLR and CLR signaling might be involved in viral recognition and trigger the proinflammatory response upon MERS-CoV infection in macrophages.",

We then tested whether siRNA depletion of RIG-I, MDA5, and Mincle have any effect on MERS-CoV-triggered immune activation. As shown in Figure 4A , the receptors were depleted to approximately 30% at transcriptional level, which were verified by Western blot analysis. In RIG-I-, MDA5-, and Mincledepleted cells, the induction of IFN-\u03b3 and IP-10 was generally abolished; and MIP-1\u03b1 and RANTES expression were significantly reduced ( Figure 4B) . A significantly attenuated IL-6 induction was observed in RIG-I-depleted cells, but not in MDA5-or Mincle-depleted cells; whereas TNF-\u03b1 production was basically unaffected after depletion of these receptors individually. The induction of IFN-\u03b3 and IP-10 was constantly and significantly reduced in various assays, including the inhibitor treatment and siRNA depletion. In addition, these 2 proinflammatory mediators are highly stimulated in severe SARS and MERS patients [34] [35] [36] . Thus, we examined MERS-CoV-induced secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and IP-10 after genetic depletion of the above-mentioned RLR and CLR receptors and adaptors. IP-10 secretion was readily detectable from both MERS-CoV-infected and mock-infected MDMs; whereas IFN-\u03b3 secretion was below the detection limit, even in the virus-infected cells. Thus, we examined MERS-CoV-induced IP-10 secretion in MDMs upon siRNA transfection. As shown in Figure 4C , genetic depletion of RIG-I, or Syk and Mincle resulted in a signification reduction of IP-10 secretion. Knockdown of RIG-I adaptor MAVS also marginally attenuated IP-10 production. Taken together, we found that disrupting RLR or CLR signaling, especially at the adaptor level, largely dampened the production of MERS-CoV-induced proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.",

We then compared Mincle expression in NP + cells versus that in NP \u2212 cells at 24 hpi. In NP \u2212 cells, Mincle protein expression, ie, the percentage of Mincle-expressing cells and the abundance of Mincle protein (mean fluorescence intensity), remained similar in the NP \u2212 cells and the mock-infected cells. It is notable that Mincle protein expression was significantly elevated in the NP + cells ( Figure 6B ). Mincle upregulation in the virus-infected cells was verified by costaining of Mincle and NP.

CARD9 activation is not only mediated by phosphorylation and ubiquitination processes, but it is also enabled by upregulation [37] . R406 had a negligible effect on CARD9 expression in the naive macrophages. However, CARD9 was significantly upregulated in MERS-CoV-infected macrophages. In contrast to the mockinfected cells, inhibition of CLR signaling by R406 significantly suppressed the degree of CARD9 activation. Thus, the results revealed the importance of CARD9 as an essential adaptor to relay CLR signaling in MERS-CoV-infected macrophages.",

It has been recognized that the rapid viral replication in lung tissues, massive inflammation, and elevated proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine response collectively contribute to acute lung injury and underlie the high pathogenicity of this life-threatening human CoV [2, 5, 34, 38] . The postmortem examination of MERS-CoV patient's lung tissues, which were obtained by needle sampling shortly after death, revealed severe pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage and mixed inflammatory cell infiltration. Immunostaining revealed numerous intra-alveolar macrophages and infiltrating T lymphocytes in the parenchyma [4] , which are consistent with the histopathological changes in lung tissues of MERS-CoVinfected marmosets. It is notable that profound macrophage proliferation was the most prominent pathological change in the postmortem examination of lung tissues of fatal SARS patients [39] . It was postulated that the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines released from the proliferative alveolar macrophages play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of SARS [40] [41] [42] . We have reported that MERS-CoV can productively infect human macrophages and trigger exuberant proinflammatory response [8] . It is conceivable that the proliferating macrophages in lung tissue of a MERS patient and the dysregulated immune response in these cells may contribute significantly to the high pathogenicity of MERS-CoV.",

The attenuated production of most proinflammatory mediators including MIP-1\u03b1, RANTES, IFN-\u03b3, and IP-10 was replicated when RLR receptors (RIG-I or MDA5) or CLR receptor (Mincle) were depleted individually. However, the dampened inflammatory response was more prominent in adaptor depletion than receptor depletion, which could be ascribed to the fact that the activation signals from multiple receptors (eg, RIG-I and MDA5) converge at 1 adaptor (eg, MAVS). Upon MERS-CoV infection, multiple PRRs were activated in the macrophages ( Figure 2 ). Therefore, depleting individual receptors was unable to entirely block the activation signals.",

The RIG-I and MDA5 are inducible upon IFN treatment or virus infection. The activated RIG-I or MDA5 interacts with an essential RLR adaptor, MAVS, initiating a signaling cascade that includes the activation of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 kinases, which subsequently phosphorylate and activate the transcription factor IRF3 and NF-\u03baB. In this study, we demonstrate that RIG-I or MDA5 were both induced in macrophages upon MERS-CoV infection. The engagement of the receptors and subsequent signaling transduction were manifested in siRNA depletion of both receptors and their adaptor MAVS, as well as TBK1/IKK\u03b5 inhibition. Thus, RLRs indeed recognize replicating MERS-CoV and mediate the proinflammation response in macrophages.",

Mincle is known to associate noncovalently with the adaptor molecule FcR\u03b3. The phosphorylation of the adaptor serves to recruit Syk and induces downstream NF-\u03baB activation through the Syk-CARD9-BCL10-MALT1 complex. The in vivo genetic studies have revealed an essential role of CLR-triggered CARD9 signaling in host protection. CARD9-deficient mice exhibited deregulated innate responses and failed to control infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [43] . In addition, Mincle was identified as a lipopolysaccharide-inducible protein in mouse macrophages and was transcriptionally upregulated after exposed to various stimuli and cellular stress [44] . In human monocytes, fungus infection elevated Mincle expression [31] .",

(A) The inhibitors for various PRR signal pathways, the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ), and the working concentration used in the study are listed. (B) The MERS-CoV-infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were treated with the inhibitors or mock-treated in triplicate.
