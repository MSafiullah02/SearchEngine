This is due to direct costs of morbidity, mortality and treatment as well as long\u2010term effects on performance. A single case of pneumonia carries a mean cost of \u00a343.26 per sick dairy calf, and a mean cost of \u00a329.58 per calf for the rest of the group. Costs in suckler calves are higher with a mean cost of \u00a382.10 per sick calf, and \u00a374.10 per calf for the rest of the group (Andrews, 2000). These estimates do not include a value for the welfare costs endured by the calves, nor the emotional cost to the stockman and others within the industry (Robertson, 2000).",

The shed never housed more than 12 animals = 72 m3 required air space. Inlet area totalled 7.12 m2 with the large open\u2010fronted door accounting for more than half of this (it was open on the day of investigation but could be closed in adverse weather conditions). A side window which joined an adjacent building full of bulling heifers, accounted for most of the rest of the inlet space. A rough on\u2010farm calculation using 0.08 m2 as the required inlet area for animals weighing 60\u2013200 kg gave a total requirement of 12 \u00d7 0.08 = 0.96 m2. Therefore, inlet although poorly controlled was sufficient, but there was no outlet. Insufficient outlet is the main reason for poor ventilation in the majority of livestock accommodation (Kelly, 2002). Any building without an exhaust in the roof will not function simply by stack effect and openings in the sidewalls will be required to operate as both inlets and outlets. The active inlet area is therefore reduced in such a situation. The roof space will have the potential to accumulate heat and moisture, leading to condensation and an ideal environment for promoting the potential survival of microorganisms (Robertson, 2000).",

Until all these areas have been addressed there is little point in spending money on specific diagnostic and control measures (Gibbs, 2001).
