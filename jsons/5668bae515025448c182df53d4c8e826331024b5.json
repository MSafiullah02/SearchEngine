Instead, she was maintained on HFNC for apneic ventilation during intubation, as the transmission rate with HFNC has been shown to be less than with bag-valve-mask ventilation. 6 She was initiated on ARDS Clinical Network (ARDSnet) protocols with lung protective strategies but had persistent hypoxia with a Pao 2 :Fio 2 ratio (P:F ratio) <150 despite neuromuscular blockade. She was then ventilated in a prone position, which led to significant improvement in her P:F ratios.

First, the now well-described cytokine storm phase of COVID-19 can lead to a profound vasodilatory shock for which angiotensin II is well established as an effective treatment. 9 Second, acute renal failure is not uncommon in COVID-19, with up to 11.9% of patients requiring renal replacement therapy. 5 A post hoc analysis of the Angiotensin for the Treatment of Vasodilatory Shock (ATHOS)-III trial showed a significant benefit for the use of angiotensin II in patients with vasodilatory shock and renal failure, specifically showing a decrease in number of days on renal replacement therapy compared to other vasopressors. 10 This decreased need for renal replacement therapy could have a significant benefit in a resource-limited environment during a pandemic. Third, 1 recent article argues for a physiologic benefit of the use of exogenous angiotensin II to improve a possible angiotensin II deficiency and a possible downregulation of the ACE2 receptor. 5 However, the physiologic argument remains controversial. A Chinese study from February 2020 showed a correlation between elevated levels of endogenous angiotensin II and lung injury in patients with COVID-19, 11 which raises concerns about the use of exogenous angiotensin II in patients with COVID-19. However, elevated levels of angiotensin II were also noted in patients with vasodilatory shock in the ATHOS-III trial. This angiotensin II elevation was actually found to represent a relative deficiency when compared to markedly elevated angiotensin I levels. In fact, these patients showed significant hemodynamic improvement with angiotensin II infusion, 12 which could point toward a therapeutic use for angiotensin II in patients with COVID-19.",
