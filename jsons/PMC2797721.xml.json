Primer, probe, and assay design was performed in our laboratory. Many primer/probe designs were obtained using the Influenza Primer Design Resource and are described in further detail in Bose et al18; coverage based on all Flu A, Flu B, and RSV GenBank entries (from before November 2008) is presented in Table 1.18,19",

Samples were then combined with 1 ml of easyMAG lysis buffer, and RNA was extracted following the manufacturer's off-board lysis procedure with the generic 1.0 protocol. RNA was eluted in 25 \u03bcl of elution buffer. Then 3.4 \u03bcl of RNA was combined with 4.6 \u03bcl of RT-PCR mix containing 2\u00d7 Platinum Tfi mix, SuperScript III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and primers/probes for all targets including the internal control and loaded into a cartridge, which was placed in a Raider thermocycler. On the Jaguar platform, 475 \u03bcl of clinical sample (or surrogate samples prepared for analytical testing, as described later) was combined with 10 \u03bcl (4.75 \u00d7 105 plaque-forming units/ml) of MS2 bacteriophage and loaded into the Jaguar sample tubes. RNA was extracted and eluted in 10 \u03bcl of elution buffer and combined with 13.5 \u03bcl of RT-PCR mix (as described above). Then 8 \u03bcl of this mixture was transferred to one of two internal high-speed thermocyclers. All steps after sample addition proceeded in a fully automated format with sample transfer and cartridge loading occurring via a robotic arm. The final primer/probe concentrations in each platform were the same, as was the final amount of MS2/rxn (approximately 700 copies). The thermocycling parameters used in both systems were 20 minutes at 50\u00b0C (room temperature), 2 minutes at 95\u00b0C (denature), and 45 cycles of 15 seconds at 95\u00b0C, 30 seconds at 56\u00b0C, and 15 seconds at 76\u00b0C, followed by a subsequent melt analysis at 45\u201385\u00b0C at a rate of 0.1\u00b0C/second. This PCR protocol takes approximately 1.5 hours to run.",

Samples were considered positive if the FAM Ct value was \u226440, the amplification curve shape was appropriate, and the FAM melt profiles yielded a melting temperature (Tm) \u00b12\u00b0C of those expected for RSV (74\u00b0C), Flu B (68\u00b0C), or Flu A (63\u00b0C) (Figure 1A). Samples were considered indeterminate if the FAM Ct value was >40.0 with an appropriate FAM Tm and amplification curve shape; indeterminate samples were repeated once. Samples were considered negative if the internal control (MS2) was positive (Tm of 73\u00b0C in the AP-593 channel) (Figure 1B) and the FAM Ct value was >40.0 with an incorrect or nonexistent Tm or an abnormal amplification curve.",

After PCR, 5 \u03bcl of the reaction was probed with each of the probes according to well described protocols for RT-PCR-enzyme hybridization assay.1,10 Analytical sensitivity was determined by testing serial dilutions of quantitated stocks of Flu A/WI/629-9/2008, Flu B/WI/629-1/2008, RSV-A/WI/625-9-1/0708, and RSV-B/WV/14617/85 in M4 viral transport medium (Remel). Analytical specificity was tested using high concentrations (\u2265105 TCID50 or colony-forming units/ml for viruses and bacteria, respectively) of the same bacteria and viruses used for specificity testing of the easyMAG/Raider and Jaguar assays. Cytomegalovirus, S. pyogenes, E. faecalis, S. sanguinis, S. mitis, and E. corrodens were not tested in this assay.",

All analytes can be detected in both platforms at concentrations of less then 10 TCID50/ml, which is comparable with detection seen with the ProFlu+ assay (LOD range from 102 to 10\u22121 TCID50/ml). Although the LOD for most targets are equivalent on both easyMAG/Raider and Jaguar systems, two exceptions are that the LOD of Flu B is approximately 2 log units better on the Jaguar then on the easyMAG/Raider platform and the LOD of RSV-A was 1 log unit better on the easyMAG/Raider platform. Both assay formats are also very specific. Testing of 23 nonspecific organisms in both formats revealed that only adenovirus type 3 showed intermittent cross-reactivity in the easyMAG/Raider format at a very high concentration of 107 TCID50/ml. In addition, comparison of samples tested by tissue culture with those tested with the easyMAG/Raider, Jaguar, and ProFlu+ assays showed that all were 99% specific. The only discrepancies observed were that RSV was detected in a specimen that was negative by tissue culture. RSV was also detected in a Flu B-positive tissue culture sample, and its presence was confirmed during discrepant analysis as a dual Flu B and RSV infection. Clinical testing demonstrated that the easyMAG/Raider and Jaguar assays exhibited greater sensitivity than the ProFlu+ assay for all three analytes (although these differences are not statistically significant). Overall sensitivities of the easyMAG/Raider and Jaguar formats were both greater than that observed for the ProFlu+ assay.",

In addition, at least 15 samples of each virus were collected in Milwaukee, WI, in 2008 and tested with the assay (these samples were used to calculate clinical sensitivity and specificity). Collectively, these viruses were from various hosts (for Flu A viruses), collection years (dating back to 1977 for Flu A, to 2004 for Flu B, and to 1985 for RSV), and geographic locations and showed that Tm values ranged from 62.4 to 64.1, 68.1 to 69.8, and 73.0 to 74.7 for Flu A, Flu B, and RSV, respectively. These data are not shown because although each target was tested with the same analyte-specific primers/probes at the proper concentrations, the compositions of the nonspecific primers/probes were not necessarily the same as those in the completed assay. However, during the course of our assay optimization we observed that changing any of the oligonucleotides, with the exception of the analyte-specific probe, yielded very little change in Tm for a given virus. For this reason we are confident that the Tm ranges reported above for Flu A, Flu B, and RSV viruses are highly representative of their true ranges using the finalized version of the assay described in this article.",

Automated multiplex assays can decrease the numbers of laboratory tests ordered per patient, the technician time used per sample, the cost per virus detected, and the overall chance for contamination.293031 In addition, the Jaguar assay proved efficient in rapidly and accurately screening a large number of Flu A, Flu B, and RSV samples during the current outbreak of a novel Flu A (H1N1) virus S-OIV in Milwaukee, WI. Flu A samples were reflexed into several subtyping assays that also confirmed the Flu A typing result (including 23 Flu A-positive samples, which were confirmed as S-OIV by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's subtyping assay at the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene). These subtyping results indicated that this Flu A, Flu B, and RSV assay could successfully detect the matrix gene of all three circulating strains of Flu A (H1N1 human, H3N2 human, and H1N1 S-OIV). This outbreak demonstrates the importance of having rapid, reliable, sensitive, and specific assays that allow clinicians and public health officials to react quickly and effectively during viral outbreaks.",
