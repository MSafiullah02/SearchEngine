Although demyelination is the primary pathological process detected in the central nervous system of infected mice, axonal dysfunction and damage also occur concomitantly with demyelination. This process is T cell mediated, with either CD4 or CD8 T cells sufficient for MHV-induced axonal damage. A striking feature is that axonal damage occurs early in the disease process, at nearly the same time as demyelination is first observed. Axonal damage in MHV-infected mice has many similarities with the parallel process in humans with multiple sclerosis.",

In this adoptive transfer model, either CD4 or CD8 T cells can mediate demyelination and disease. T cells are necessary for the demyelinating process since transfer of splenocytes depleted of CD4 and CD8 T cells results in no demyelination. RAG1 / recipients of CD4 T cellenriched splenocytes (CD8 T cell-depleted) or CD8 T cell-enriched splenocytes (CD4 T cell-depleted) also develop demyelination, although with different kinetics than recipients of undepleted splenocytes. CD4 T cell enrichment results in a rapid course of disease, with mortality by day 7 p.i., while CD8 T cell enrichment results in a protracted course of disease (as compared to wild type), with mortality at day 14-16 p.i. or later. Strikingly, up to 50% demyelination is observed in recipients of CD8 T cell-enriched populations by 15 days p.i.

This infiltration of macrophages was accompanied by roughly half the level of staining for nonphosphoneurofilament H as detected in areas of frank demyelination. Areas of normal appearing white matter distant from demyelinating lesions, as assessed by staining with LFB, were generally devoid of macrophages and viral antigen, although scattered virus-infected cells were occasionally detected in these regions of the spinal cord. These areas had only limited staining with mAb SMI-32. This staining may have resulted from direct viral damage to the axon, since viral antigen has been detected throughout axons (19) .

This method quantifies total damage throughout the spinal cord, but because the majority of the spinal cord does not exhibit demyelination, tended to blunt differences between samples. To address this issue, the number of SMI-32 positive blebs in areas of demyelination, areas adjacent to demyelination, or normal appearing white matter was counted in a blinded fashion ( Figure C3-2B) .

This is the first time point at which demyelination is detectable. Surprisingly, axonal damage, as measured by SMI-32 positivity, was found in these mice. This occurred only in areas of early macrophage infiltration and viral antigen, suggesting that demyelination and axonal damage occur concomitantly, and are mediated at least in part by the same effector agents.",

We reasoned that these differences in phenotype could be related to differences in the amount of axonal damage mediated by these two cell types. Therefore, the adoptive transfer system was used to elucidate the contribution of CD4 and CD8 T cells to the pathogenesis of axonal damage. MHV-infected RAG1 -/ mice received splenocytes enriched for either CD4 or CD8 T cells three days p.i. We quantified the amount of axonal damage by measuring the number of pixels above background in spinal cords stained with mAb SMI-32 and analyzed by confocal microscopy.",

Surprisingly, no difference in total mAb SMI-32 immunoreactivity could be detected between the spinal cords of recipients of CD4 T cell-or CD8 T cellenriched splenocytes. The amount of axonal damage was not different statistically from that observed in recipients of undepleted populations of cells. In addition, the amount of axonal damage was not well correlated with the extent of demyelination. These results show that axonal damage did not explain the differences in clinical disease observed between the recipients of undepleted and T cell subset-enriched splenocytes.",

CD8 T cell-mediated demyelination is interferon-7 mediated, whereas CD4 T cell-mediated demyelination is increased in the absence of this cytokine (20, 21) . Demyelination itself is associated with changes in the cytoskeletal structure of the associated axon (22) . In mice with genetic disruption of the proteolipid protein gene, axonal dysfunction is observed in the presence of normally compacted myelin (23, 24) . In some models, demyelinated axons appear to be able to compensate for the loss of myelin by upregulating ion channels necessary to maintain conduction (25, 26) . Other demyelinated axons fail to do so, leading to severe conduction defects and axonal dysfunction. It is likely that T cells and macrophages/microglia, by creating a pro-inflammatory milieu, contribute to the pathogenesis of axonal injury. Important issues to be resolved include identifying the effector molecules and cells that cause axonal damage and determining if axonal injury is a necessary consequence of demyelination. Once the mechanisms of axonal dysfunction and damage are better understood, it may be possible to design therapy to minimize axonal disease in MHV-infected mice, and ultimately, in humans with MS.",
