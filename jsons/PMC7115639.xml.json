It has been estimated that about 20% of the patients with epilepsy using the first generation of antiepileptic drugs (Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Sodium valproate and Diazepam) were not able to acquire adequate control of seizure [1]. In fact, epilepsy is the third most frequent neurological disorder encountered in the elderly after cerebrovascular disease and dementia [2]. There is continuing demand for new anticonvulsant agents as several of the currently available antiepileptic drugs (AED) have been associated with severe side effects and fail to control seizures in about 30% of epileptic patients [3], [4], [5]. The search for antiepileptic agents with more selectivity and lower toxicity continues to be an area of investigation in medicinal chemistry.",

However, it has been observed that the maximum potency of the drugs that act on the central nervous system (CNS) is obtained with congeners having an optimum lipophilicity (log Po). In this study, we attempted to correlate the anticonvulsant activity of synthesized compounds with their log \nP value. The experimental log \nP values were determined using octanol-phosphate buffer method and the calculated log \nP values were taken from the software ChemOffice 6.0 and the results are shown in Table 1. Most of the synthesized compounds met the criteria for lipophilicty and showed good anticonvulsant activity with lesser neurotoxicity. Due to their higher lipophilicity they are expected to have rapid onset and shorter duration of action.",

In this model, the presence of thioamide and amide (HBD) fragment is essential for activity. Beside this, all of the compounds contained two hydrophobic units (A & R aryl rings) as a distal binding site and Isatin as electron donar (D). Five compounds showed better anticonvulsant activity and among these compounds 5h and 5i emerged as a lead compounds in the series when they were subjected to preliminary anticonvulsant screenings. They also showed marked lower neurotoxicity and, therefore, a higher protective index. These can be regarded as strong candidates for future investigations.",

After adding all indoline-2, 3-dione, flask was fitted with reflux condenser and the mixture was heated on water bath maintaining the temperature at 60 \u00b0C for 1 h to obtain the desired compound 5-nitroindoline-2, 3-dione (1). Content was then poured into a beaker containing 500 mL cold water, stirred in order to wash out as much acid from the desired compound. When compound (1) completely settled to the bottom, the upper acid liquor was completely poured off from the mixture. Then the residual liquid was transferred to the separating funnel and shaked vigorously with about 50 mL of water.

Animals are pretreated with various doses of the test compound (in the similar manner to the MES test, although a dose of 50 mg/kg (p.o.) is the standard for Test 2 scPTZ). At the previously determined TPE of the test compound, the dose of Pentylenetetrazole which induce convulsions in 97% of animals (CD97: 85 mg/kg mice; 70 mg/kg rats) is injected into a loose fold of skin in the midline of the neck. The animals are placed in isolation cages to minimize stress [26] and observed for the next 30 min for the presence or absence of the seizure. An episode of clonic spasms, approximately 3\u20135 s, of the forte and/or hindlimbs, jaws, or vibrissae is taken as the endpoint. Animals which do not meet this criterion are considered protected.",

In order to identify potential AED with this profile, some compounds were tested in the minimal clonic seizure (6 Hz or psychomotor) test. Like the maximal electroshock (MES) test, the minimal clonic seizure (6 Hz) test [27] was used to assess compound\u2019s efficacy against electrically induced seizures but used a lower frequency (6 Hz) and longer duration of stimulation (3 s). Test compounds were pre-administered to mice via i.p. injection. At varying times, individual mice (four mice per time point) were challenged with sufficient current delivered through corneal electrodes to elicit a psychomotor seizure in 97% of animals (32 mA for 3 s). The untreated mice would display seizures characterized by a minimal clonic phase followed by stereotyped, automatistic behaviors, described originally as being similar to the aura of human patients with partial seizures. Animals not displaying this behavior were considered to be protected.",

In rats, minimal motor deficit is indicated by ataxia, which is manifested by an abnormal, uncoordinated gait.
