To examine this, the complete genomic sequences of the two subpopulations of the VicS vaccine, VicS-v and VicS-del, were determined. Compared with VicS-v, the more attenuated VicS-del strain had two nonsynonymous changes in the non-structural protein 6 (nsp6), a transmembrane (TM) domain that may participate in autocatalytic release of the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, a polymorphic difference at the end of the S2 gene, which coincided with the body transcription-regulating sequence (B-TRS) of mRNA 3 and a truncated open reading frame for a peptide encoded by gene 4 (4b). These genetic differences could be responsible for the differences between these variants in pathogenicity in vivo, and replication in vitro. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome showed that VicS-v and VicS-del did not cluster with strains from other countries, supporting the hypothesis that Australian IBV strains have been evolving independently for some time, and analyses of individual polymerase peptide and S glycoprotein genes suggested a distant common ancestor with no recent recombination. This study suggests the potential role of the TM domain in nsp6, the integrity of the S2 protein and the B-TRS 3, and the putative accessory protein 4b, as well as the 3\u2032 untranslated region, in the virulence and replication of IBV and has provided a better understanding of relationships between the Australian vaccine strain of IBV and those used elsewhere.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious and widespread disease of chickens and is a major ongoing problem in all countries with an intensive poultry industry (Sapats et al., 1996; Casais et al., 2003) .

VicS-del lacks three Gly-Gly motifs seen in VicS-v that are located in the middle of nsp2, nsp6 and nsp14. These motifs may result in additional proteolytic processing of these three nsps, and the absence of them in VicS-del could alter their function. Nsp6 and nsp14 are reported to contain transmembrane (TM) and exonuclease domains (Ziebuhr, 2005) , while the function of nsp2 remains undetermined. Highly conserved Gly-Gly motifs were also found between nucleotides 2044 and 2049 (within nsp2), 3667 and 3672, 4426 and 4431 (within nsp3), 9199 and 9204, and 9391 and 9396 (within nsp5) in both VicS-v and VicS-del and in other IBVs. These motifs may also be further processed by PLP, although the previously characterized PLP cleavage sites (between nsp2 and 3, and nsp3 and 4) have an extended motif of Lys-Ala-Gly-Gly, which has been identified in all the complete genome sequences analysed in this study; this extended motif is not seen at these additional Gly-Gly sites.

The mutations in nsp6 of VicS-del (Table 1 ) may have implications for the replication of this virus, which would be consistent with data from previous in vivo studies (Hewson et al., 2012) . During infection 3CL, the main protease, is auto-catalytically released (Ziebuhr et al., 2001; Ziebuhr, 2005) . There may be an interaction between the 3CL (nsp5), the TM2 (nsp4) and the TM3 (nsp6) hydrophobic domains (Ziebuhr, 2005) , which are also referred to as MP1 and MP2 (Tibbles et al., 1996) , during this proteolytic process. The importance of TM3/MP2, the transmembrane domain downstream of the 3CL proteinase, in the autocatalytic processing of 3CL has been suggested by in vitro assays (Tibbles et al., 1996) . In this experiment, the further processing of a 66-kDa immature protein product into smaller, post-translationally cleaved products of 59, 42, 35 and 24 kDa (with the 35-kDa peptide the size predicted for the fully processed form of 3CL protease) did not occur if these two hydrophobic domains were not associated with microsomal membranes. Changes in TM3/ MP2, such as those detected in VicS-del, could affect the membrane association of this domain and thus the conformation of the protein, and the autocatalytic release of 3CL, which is essential for the initial stages of replication (Ziebuhr, 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 63, "end": 81, "text": "(Lim et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 82, "end": 96, "text": "Ziebuhr, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 434, "end": 449, "text": "(Ziebuhr, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1202, "text": "Ziebuhr (2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1305, "text": "Phillips et al.

The difference in the proportions of each of the nonsynonymous codons between the VicS-v and VicS-del populations, with a greater prevalence of the truncation phenotype in the VicS-del population, suggests that truncation of the S2 protein may be related to the difference in virulence between these strains. The carboxyl terminal end of S2 anchors the S protein to the virion and also assists in membrane fusion with target cells (Cavanagh, 2007) . Alternatively, the differing B-TRS sequences, CUGAA-CAA and CUUAACAA, which have both been identified previously in IBV (Mondal & Cardona, 2007; Woo et al., 2010) , may differ in their efficiency in regulating replication and transcription and thus may influence production of mRNA 3, which encodes the E protein.
