While other fields have previously explored social capital as a dimension of community integration, public health can find particular value in applying such concepts to disaster preparedness. A growing body of literature supports the integral role of social capital in all phases of disaster management i.e., preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. Though traditional disaster management emphasizes the value of physical, economic, and human capital, increasing research supports the notion that dimensions such as social cohesion and social networks particularly apply to preparedness work (Dynes, 2006) .",

This abrupt entrance of bioterrorism and preparedness as critical priorities has fundamentally reshaped public health in the new 21st century. Moreover, the emergence of H5N1 avian influenza has triggered renewed concerns about a possible global pandemic.

With respect to disasters and emergencies, such groups could include businesses, schools, religious organizations, community organizations and a host of government agencies, such as emergency management, health departments, fire departments or police departments, just to name a few. Such groups can improve disaster preparedness through collective socialization, preparation, and efficacy, e.g., formal joint training, drills and exercises, and practice of implementation of incident command systems. Individuals could range from vulnerable persons at risk in local communities to major leaders and officials in the groups noted above. At-risk individuals need to access resources through social engagement and support. Government agency leaders need to reach across to colleagues in other areas to ensure the highest levels of communication and coordination before, during and after a crisis.",

Once again, such concepts have special relevance to disasters and emergencies. A community with social cohesion may be better able to prepare for, and recover from, a flood than one less unified. Also individuals with ready access to support from family members and others in their community may be better able to cope with, or even avoid, the consequences of a disaster, compared to those without such networks. As one major example, Hurricane Katrina focused worldwide attention on the tragic outcomes of those without networks and resources. No doubt dimensions of social capital can influence emergency preparedness outcomes at the level of the individual, the community, the state, the country or indeed, the entire globe.",

As noted by others, bonding capital refers to resources accessed within social groups consisting of members alike with respect to social features such as class and race (Gittell & Vidal, 1998) . With respect to emergencies and disaster preparedness, examples include strengthening local communities through better information channels and mobilization of volunteers. Meanwhile, bridging capital refers to resources built through connections made across social identity boundaries. In preparedness, such examples could include creating connections between local communities and official agencies and building trust between local residents and authorities.",

For example, among environmental scientists, there is growing interest in the role of social capital and global climate change (Adger, 2001; Pelling & High, 2005) . In light of the causal link between global climate change and the increasing incidence of natural disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis and floods, researchers have identified social capital as an important tool in disaster mitigation. For example, Semenza, et al. (1996) found that during the 1995 heat wave in Chicago, in addition to location (i.e., living on the top floor of building) and access to air conditioning, variables related to social contact and networks were also strong predictors of mortality. Specifically, the authors found that individuals who participated in church or social groups had a significantly lower risk of death during the heat wave. It is clear from these findings that social networks and social capital are important tools in community coping with stresses, and serve to mitigate adverse outcomes of disasters and other events associated with climate change.",

Nakagawa and Shaw (2004) hypothesized that differing rates of post-disaster recovery following major earthquakes in Kobe, Japan and Gujarat, India could be attributed to disparate levels of existing social capital in the two cities. In the immediate aftermath of the 1995 Kobe earthquake, neighborhood groups (previously formed in the 1960s to protest polluting factories) quickly reconvened to assist with school evacuation, establish community kitchens, and help protect against looting. These actions accelerated response efforts and served to initiate rebuilding.",

Nevertheless, exceptions were notable. For example, within a matter of weeks, select tight-knit groups such as the Vietnamese enclave in East New Orleans were already engaged in rebuilding efforts (Hauser, 2005; Shaftel, 2006) . Many of the 20,000 Vietnamese in New Orleans had previously emigrated to the U.S. in the 1970-1980s and have since maintained strong social and cultural networks. Using a church as headquarters, the Vietnamese residents of East New Orleans formed neighborhood teams to rebuild, repair, and decontaminate houses, prepare meals for families visiting to check on their property, and drive one another to work, church, and temporary housing.",

One poignant illustration is the dramatic volunteer convergence on New York City following the terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001, documented to include over 15,000 individuals within two and a half weeks. A qualitative study conducted by Lowe and Fothergill (2003) found that the primary motivation for volunteering was a need \"to contribute something positive and find something meaningful in the midst of a disaster characterized by cruelty and terror\" (p. 298). The authors characterized the impact of such spontaneous volunteerism on both the community and the volunteers themselves, i.e., affecting both groups and individuals. One volunteer described the work as \"honoring our commitment to the American public\" (p. 303), implying a broad national community. Individual impact was noted when \"the volunteers found that by working with new groups of people. . . . . they experienced a sense of solidarity with different community members\" (p. 303). In another example outside of the United States, an estimated 2 million volunteers responded to assist with search and rescue, medical aid, transportation, and provision of shelter following the 1985 earthquake in Mexico City (Dynes & Quarantelli, 1990) .",

The National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) notes that regionalization has promoted coordination (of local public health and partners in public safety and emergency medical services), standardization (of resources and emergency plans) and centralization of local emergency response capability (Bashir, Lafronza, Fraser, Brown, & Cope, 2003; Hajat, Brown, & Fraser, 2001) . In so doing, improved collective efficacy can be realized. Analyses have noted that regionalization has served as a foundation for sharing resources, coordinating planning, conducting trainings and improving capacity. For example, in Massachusetts, regionalization led to emergency local capacity essential for pandemics and mass casualties, such as establishment of 24/7 emergency on-call capacity for all local public health officials in the state (when none previously existed) and mutual aid agreements for over 60% of local public health departments (compared to none previously). In fact, in the few short years of its existence, regionalization has facilitated the efficient organization of Hepatitis A immunization clinics in the face of food borne outbreaks, and coordination of seasonal flu vaccine distribution during the shortages of the 2004-2005 season (Koh, Shei, Judge et al., 2006) . Such examples reflect enhanced social capital within groups (e.g., nurses and allied health professionals) and bridging between groups (local health groups and state public health officials).",

Additional personnel needed for deployment in a crisis would include, in addition to physicians (approximately 800,000 in the U.S.) and nurses (approximately 2.2 M in the U.S.), veterinarians, pharmacists, mental health professionals and a host of other allied health professionals. Such providers would not only administer direct care to those who are sick but could also aid with mass prophylaxis efforts to the many more who may be exposed or at risk. To augment this national network, communities across the U.S. are engaging volunteers in emergency response. With respect to space, all hospitals have been charged by HRSA and other organizations to identify additional beds for use in pandemics and emergencies. In addition to staffed beds (beds that are licensed, staffed, and physically available), all acute care hospitals are ascertaining surge capacity by identifying other beds that: are licensed but not staffed, can be made available within 24 hours (by discharging patients and canceling elective procedures) or within 72 hours (through use of non-traditional locations such as hospital cafeterias, chapels, etc.). In the event that hospital capacity is still overwhelmed, professionals across the country are currently identifying other health care facilities such as community health centers (Koh, Shei, Bataringaya et al., 2006) or even non-medical sites such schools, gymnasiums, armories, and convention centers. Considerations for such facilities include dimensions such as bed capacity, sanitary facilities, food services, and security. The shortage of medical supplies has also prompted bridging outside the medical world to other parts of government and society to generate sufficient resources. Many have argued that preparing for pandemic influenza first entails mastering the proper coordination of national vaccination efforts for annual seasonal influenza, which yearly leads to 36,000 deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations (Thompson, Shay, & Weintraub, 2003 . In particular, the fragmented nature of the national seasonal influenza vaccine supply became starkly apparent during 2004-2005, when a national low of 61 M doses led to prioritization of risk groups for immunization for the first time. Production for 2006-2007 is now estimated to reach a high of 115 -120M doses, however (Fauci, 2006) . Shortages of antibiotics and antiviral agents may require interaction with the federal Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), managed by the CDC and DHHS. The SNS contains prepackaged pharmaceutical agents that can be deployed to states at the governor's request. All states have prepared preliminary plans for the receipt and management of stockpile materials, and many have initiated planning for emergency dispensing at the local level.",

There are approximately 105,000 ventilators in the U.S., with as many as 80,000 in use at any given time for medical care; and more that 100,000 required during a typical influenza season (Osterholm, 2005) .
