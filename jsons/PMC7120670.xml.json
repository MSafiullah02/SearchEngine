However, this does not imply that Singapore is safe, or immune from being affected by disasters. Singapore houses a population of 5.2 million, a ranking of the third highest population density in the world. About 80 % of Singapore\u2019s population resides in high-rise buildings (Asian Disaster Reduction Center 2005). A major disaster of any sort could inflict mass casualties and extensive destruction to properties in Singapore. Clearly, like its neighboring countries, Singapore is also vulnerable to both natural and man-made disasters alongside its remarkable economic growth. The potential risks may result from its dense population, intricate transportation network, or a transnational communicable disease. Moreover, Singapore can be affected by the situations in surrounding countries. For example, flooding in Thailand and Vietnam may affect the price of rice sold in Singapore.",

Chief among these, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 was the most devastating. The SARS outbreak brought about far-reaching public health and economic consequences for the country as a whole. Fortunately, the outbreak was eventually contained through a series of risk mitigating measures introduced by the Singapore government and the responsiveness of all Singaporeans. It is important to point out that these risk mitigating measures, along with the public\u2019s compliance, were swiftly adjusted to address the volatile conditions\u2014such as when more epidemiological cases were uncovered.",

To achieve our research objective, we utilized a triangulation strategy of various research methodologies. To understand the principles and practices of Singapore\u2019s approach to disaster risk management, we carry out an historical analysis of official documents obtained from the relevant Singapore government agencies as well as international organizations, literature reviews, quantitative analysis of economic impacts, qualitative interviews with key informants (e.g. public health professionals and decision-makers), and email communications with frontline managers from the public sector (e.g. the Singapore Civil Defense Force, the Communicable Disease Centre) and non-governmental organizations. The authors also employed the \u2018cultural insider\u2019 approach by participating in epidemic control procedures against SARS.1 In particular, we use the method of case study to illuminate Singapore\u2019s approach to disaster risk management. The rationale of doing a case study of SARS along with Singapore\u2019s all-hazard approach is that the case study can best showcase the contextual differences, those being political, economic, and social. This case study aims to highlight the lessons drawn from past experiences in a specific context and timeframe, through which we are able to focus more on the nature of the risks, and the processes and the impacts of the disaster risk management and policy intervention. We also examined relevant literature on risk mitigating measures against communicable diseases in order to establish our conclusions. We evaluated oral accounts provided by key health policy decision-makers and experts for valuable insights.",

Applying the approach to a case study, our research enriches the vocabulary of risk management, adding to the body of knowledge on disaster management specific to the region of Southeast Asia. Indeed, the dominant perspective in this field holds that the state must be able to exercise brute force and impose its will on the population (Lai and Tan 2012). However, as shown in our paper, this dominant perspective is incomplete as the exercise of authority and power from the government is not necessarily sufficient to contain the transmission of transnational communicable diseases. Success in fighting epidemics, as most would agree, is also contingent on a concerted effort of partnership between governmental authorities and the population at large. As discussed in the first section of this volume, community and family ties along with government responses can mitigate disasters.",

However, the high-rise buildings that are built on soft-soil in Singapore are still vulnerable to earthquakes from far afield (Asian Disaster Reduction Center 2005). This is because Singapore is at a distance (nearest) of 600 km from the Sumatran subduction zone and 400 km away from the Sumatra fault both of which have the potential of generating large magnitude earthquakes. This geographic vicinity may produce a resonance like situation within high-rise buildings on soft-soil. Recent tremors from the September 2009 Sumatra offshore earthquake were experienced in 234 buildings located mainly in the central, northern and western parts of Singapore. On the front of potential tsunamis, Singapore has developed a national tsunami response plan which is a multiagency government effort comprising of an early warning system, tsunami mitigation and emergency response plans, and public education.",

The floods take place due to heavy rainfall that aggregates over short periods of time. The worst floods in Singapore\u2019s history took place on 2 December 1978. The floods claimed seven lives, forced more than 1,000 people to be evacuated, and the total damages reached SGD10 million (Tan 1978). The swift and sudden floods in 1978 were caused by a combination of factors including torrential monsoon rains, drainage problems, and high incoming tides. Over the following years, Singapore saw a series of flash floods hit various parts of the city-state. For example, 2006\u20132007 Southeast Asian floods hit Singapore on 18 December 2006 as a result of 366 mm rainfall in 24 h. From 2010 onwards, Singapore has experienced a series of flash floods due to the higher-than-average rainfall. One severe episode occurred on16 June 2010 that flooded shopping malls and basement car parks in its most famous shopping area\u2014Orchard Road.",

For example, the Greek tanker Spyros explosion at the Jurong Shipyard in 1978 was Singapore\u2019s worst industrial disaster in terms of lives lost (Ministry of Labor, Singapore 1979). In 1986, the six-storey Hotel New World collapse was Singapore\u2019s deadliest civil disaster claiming 33 lives. The collapse was due to structural faults. The SCDF, together with other rescue forces, spent 7 days on the whole relief operation. After the collapse, the government introduced more stringent regulations on construction building codes, and the SCDF went through a series of upgrades in training and equipment (Goh 2004).",

The haze in 1997, called the Southeast Asian haze, was caused by slash and burn techniques adopted by farmers in Indonesia. The smoke haze carried particulate matter that caused an increase of acute health effects including increased hospital visits due to respiratory distress such as asthma, pulmonary infection, as well as eye and skin irritation. The haze also severely affected visibility in addition to increasing health problems. As a result, Singapore\u2019s health surveillance showed a 30 % increase in outpatient attendance for haze-related conditions (Emmanuel 2000). Apart from healthcare costs, other costs associated with the haze included short-term tourism and production losses. A study by environmental economists of the 1997 Southeast Asian haze indicated a total of USD$74.1 million in economic losses in Singapore alone. Singapore is actively involved in various regional meetings to deal with trans-boundary smoke haze pollution in order to reduce the risk (Singapore Institute of International Affairs 2006).",

The unexpected outbreak of SARS led to greater uncertainty in the Singapore economy. Singapore\u2019s financial markets were severely affected due to the loss of public confidence and reduced floor trading. The impact of SARS on the stock market reflected in the Straits Times Index (STI) (see Fig. 15.1). The market did not react well to the SARS epidemic. In the first fortnight of the epidemic, the STI closed down 76 points. Even though more cases were reported, the STI climbed progressively up 86 points over the next fortnight, eclipsing the earlier falls. This could be attributed to the strict measures which the Singapore government introduced. The STI remained relatively stable over the immediate fortnight as new cases were reported. However, it started a downward plunge over the following fortnight as the number of cases peaked once more. The STI plunged 96 points. However, the resilience of the STI was shown when it climbed back up, surpassing the level reported at the beginning of the SARS period.

The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) revised the forecast for Singapore\u2019s annual GDP growth down from 3 to 0.5 %. This forecast was later revised upwards to 2.5 %. There were a number of channels by which the SARS epidemic affected the economy. The economic impacts will be discussed from the positions of demand and supply shocks. The main economic impact of the SARS outbreak was on the demand side, as consumption and the demand for services declined (Henderson 2003). The economic consequence caused fear and anxiety among Singaporeans and potential tourists to Singapore. The hardest and most directly hit were the tourism, retail, hospitality and transport-related industries, for example airline, cruise, hotel, restaurant, travel agent, retail and taxi services, and their auxiliary industries (see Fig. 15.3 and Table 15.1). Visitor arrivals fell by one third in March 2003, and two thirds in April 2003. This had a direct impact on hotel occupancy rates, which declined sharply to 30 % in late April 2003. Cancellation or postponement of tourism events increased by about 30\u201340 %. Revenues of restaurants dropped by 50 % while revenues of the travel agents decreased by 70 %. SARS had an uneven impact on various sectors of the economy. A four-tiered framework to assess the impact on the respective sectors showed that Tier 1 industries, such as the tourism and travel-related industries were most severely hit. Tier 1 industries account for 3.5 % of GDP. The Tier 2 industries, such as restaurants, retail and land transport industries were significantly hit, which account for 7.5 % of GDP. The next two tiers were less directly affected by the SARS outbreak. Tier 3 industries include real estate and stock broking, which account for close to 19 % of GDP. The remaining 70 % of the domestic economy in Tier 4 includes manufacturing, construction and communications. These industries were not directly impacted by the outbreak of SARS. All in all, the estimated decline in GDP directly from SARS was 1 %, equaling SGD875 million.\n\n",

The trend for visitor inflow is that visitor inflows fall sharply. This is especially true in the case of Singapore, when visitor stays tend to be shorter and the high-end visitors stayed away. As a result, tourism and other related industries were nearly crippled due to a significant reduction in both leisure and business travel. For example, tourist arrivals saw a significant drop of 15 % in March 2003. The drop in tourist arrivals was 67 % in April 2003, and 65 % for the month of May 2003 until the first week of June 2003.

A more comprehensive analysis of the economic costs of SARS will need to consider the direct impact on consumer spending and indirect repercussions of the shock on trade and investment (Asian Development Bank Outlook 2003). The economic costs from a global disease, such as SARS, go beyond the immediate impacts incurred in the affected sectors of disease-inflicted countries. This is not just because the disease spreads quickly across countries through networks related to global travel, but also because any economic shocks to one country spread quickly to other countries through the increased trade and financial linkages associated with globalization. However, just calculating the number of cancelled tourist trips, the declines in retail trade, and some of the factors discussed earlier do not provide a complete picture of the impact of SARS. This is because there are close linkages within economies, across sectors, and across economies in both international trade and international capital flows. Thus, analyzing the tourism sector alone may not be sufficient in analyzing the overall financial impact of SARS. SARS inflicted a heavy toll on businesses and immediately impacted severely the viability of business.",

As the workforce shrunk due to absenteeism, business operations, for example supply chain, flow of goods worldwide and provision of services, were all affected both locally and internationally. In terms of retrenchment, the job prospects of employees in affected companies appeared miserable. A survey performed during the SARS period showed that the jobless rate increased more than 5.5 %, the highest for the last decade in Singapore (Ministry of Manpower, Singapore 2003). In absolute numbers, overall employment diminished by 25,963 in the second quarter of 2003, the largest quarterly decline since the mid-1980s recession. Unlike previous retrenchment that affected mainly blue-collar labor, SARS also affected white-collar employees too. The implementation of workplace SARS control measures added to operational and administrative costs. For example, the policy of temperature taking was implemented at workplaces in the private sector. Numerous private establishments installed thermal-scanners in their entrances from day one. However, such precautionary measures were necessary to contain the disease. This helped to restore business confidence and investment potential (a lower level of investments will lead to slower capital growth). But the reduction in an economy\u2019s capacity may linger on for a few quarters before it is restored to pre-SARS levels. The loss of productive working days from quarantine, and implementation costs incurred to monitor movements of employees contributed to the reduction in the aggregate supply front. Some of these economic effects may have worsened the public health situation if strategic planning was not in place.",

Such uncertainty of contracting a highly contagious disease actually deteriorated the fear of security breaches, and the panic of overexposure (Tan 2006). Responding to the uncertainty of disease transmission, the Singapore government instituted many draconian public policies, such as social distancing, quarantine and isolation, as risk mitigating measures. All of these control measures created an instinctive withdrawal from society for the general population. This brought about a behavior which resulted in the public avoiding crowds and public places with human interaction. On 24 March 2003, the MOH invoked the Infectious Disease Act (IDA) to isolate all those who had been exposed to SARS patients. After IDA was invoked, on 25 March 2003, schools and non-essential public places were closed. Public events were cancelled to prevent close contact in crowds. Singaporeans with contact history were asked to stay home for a period of time to prevent transmission. Harsh penalties, such as hefty fines of more than USD4,000 or imprisonment, were imposed on those who defied quarantine orders. In a drastic move reminiscent of a police state, closed-circuit cameras were installed in the houses of those ordered to stay home to monitor their compliance with the quarantine order (ABC News Online 2003). At the height of SARS, 12,194 suspected cases were ordered to stay home, all of whom were monitored either by cameras or in less severe cases, by telephone calls. Quarantine, regardless of its effectiveness, received strong criticism from the general public during the outbreak of SARS due to the invasive nature of that measure (Duncanson 2003). Impact of social distancing remains unclear, but WHO has recommended such control measures depending on the severity of the epidemic, risk groups affected and epidemiology of transmission (World Health Organization 2005). Singapore\u2019s MOH advocated the practice of social distancing during the outbreak of SARS. The sole intention of social distancing was to limit physical interactions and close contact in public areas to slow the rate of disease transmission. Additionally, social distancing measures in particular have a psychological impact. The practice of social distancing led to a social setback in businesses that suffered economic losses as a result (Duncanson 2003). The psychological impact of SARS is longer lasting. The most immediate and tragic impact was the loss of loved ones.",

Only 2 days later, after more SARS cases were reported and a better epidemiological understanding of the strain was developed, the Singapore government swiftly declared SARS a notifiable disease under the Infectious Disease Act (IDA) (Ministry of Health, Singapore 2003a). In the case of a broad outbreak, IDA made it legally permissible to enforce mandatory health examination and treatment, exchange of medical information and cooperation between healthcare providers and the MOH, and the quarantine and isolation of SARS patients (Infectious Disease Act 2003). In particular, the government amended the IDA on 24 April 2003 requiring all those who had come into contact with SARS patients to remain indoors or report immediately to designated medical institutions for quarantine (Ministry of Health, Singapore 2003b). Asa legacy of Singapore\u2019s British colonial past, the Singapore legislature is unique and well-known for passing laws in a swift and efficient manner. The uniqueness in Singapore\u2019s legal framework allows Singapore to swiftly amend the IDA during health crises to suit volatile conditions, for instance when more epidemiological cases were uncovered and the virus was better understood. All in all, the IDA played an adaptive role in terms of facilitating a swift response to the outbreak of this particular epidemic. On 22 March 2003, the CEG designated the restructured public hospital\u2014Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) as the SARS hospital (James et al. 2006; Tan 2006). That is, once a suspected SARS patient was detected at a local clinic or emergency department, he or she would then be transferred to TTSH immediately for further evaluation and monitoring. The national healthcare system prioritized life-saving resources such as medicine and medical equipment to allocate manpower and protective equipment to the TTSH. To ease the flu-like patient influx into the TTSH, the government diverted non-flu patients away from TTSH so that the sudden surge in the number of flu cases at TTSH did not paralyze its service delivery.",

To mitigate SARS impact on Singapore\u2019s economy, the government took every precaution and spared no effort to contain the SARS outbreak in Singapore. Two aspects of SARS warranted government intervention to mitigate economic impact. First, the information that needs to be collected and disseminated to effectively assess SARS displays the characteristics of public good. Second, there are negative externalities related to contagious diseases in the sense that they affect third parties in market transactions. Public good and negative externalities are typical areas where government action is needed (Fan 2003). There are three major factors which can explain why some economies are more vulnerable and susceptible to the effect of SARS than others (Asian Development Bank Outlook 2003). These factors are structural issues (e.g. shares of tourism in GDP and the composition of consumer spending), initial consumer sentiments, and government responses. As the research shows, the Singapore government implemented a USD 132 million (SGD 231 million in 2003) SARS relief package to reduce the costs for tourism operators and its auxiliary services. On the other hand, an economic relief package worth USD 131m (SGD 230m) was created to aid businesses hit by SARS.5 In addition, the government incurred USD$109m (SGD 192m) in direct operating expenditure related to SARS, and committed another USD 60m (SGD105m) development expenditure of hospitals for additional isolation rooms and medical facilities to treat SARS and other infectious diseases. The government\u2019s economic incentives worked when seeking cooperation of other healthcare providers (such as public hospitals and local clinics) so that they would absorb additional cases of non-flu illnesses.",

When SARS first surfaced, the nature of this virus was largely unknown. As a consequence, health authorities worldwide were mostly unable to detect and monitor suspected cases. Health authorities in Singapore encountered this same problem. But with the aid of WHO technical advisors, Singapore managed to establish in a timely manner identification and reporting procedures. Furthermore, the MOH also expanded the WHO\u2019s definitions for suspected cases of SARS (to include any healthcare workers with fever and/or respiratory symptoms) in order to widen the surveillance net (Goh et al. 2006). As the pace of SARS transmission quickened, the Singapore Parliament amended the IDA on 25 April 2003 requiring all suspected SARS cases to be reported to the MOH within 24 h from the time of diagnosis.",

The movements of HCWs in public hospitals were also heavily proscribed. Unfortunately, except for TTSH, these critical measures were not enforced in all healthcare sectors until 8 April 2003, and this oversight resulted in a number of intra-hospital infections (Goh et al. 2006). In addition, the policy of restricting the movements of HCWs and visitors to hospitals was taken further. More specifically, their movements between hospitals were now restricted. Patient movement between hospitals, meanwhile, was strictly restricted to medical transfers. The number of visitors to hospitals was also limited and their particulars recorded during each visit. It is also important to point out that these somewhat draconian control measures required strong public support and cooperation.

A dedicated TV Channel called the SARS Channel was launched to broadcast information on the symptoms and transmission mechanisms of the virus (James et al. 2006). The importance of social responsibility and personal hygiene was a frequent message heard throughout the SARS epidemic. As an example, when Tan Tock Seng Hospital was designated as the SARS hospital at the peak of SARS epidemics, the government undertook many efforts in public communication and education to seek cooperation and support from other healthcare providers, such as public hospitals and local clinics, so that they would absorb the additional cases of non-flu illnesses. Many organizations displayed prominent signs in front of their building entrances that reminded their staff as well as visitors to be socially responsible.

In Singapore\u2019s case, we also notice the success of containing an uncertain, high-impact disaster has to rely on surge capacity.",

            "text": "In the context of this paper, surge capacity refers to the ability to mobilize resources (such as PPEs, vaccines and HCWs) to combat the outbreak of a pandemic. Singapore\u2019s response to SARS in 2003 illustrates the importance of being able to increase surge capacity swiftly to deal with an infectious disease outbreak. In the Asia Pacific region, this problem continues to hamper many countries\u2019 ability to combat infectious diseases (Putthasri et al. 2009). For many public health organizations in Asia, it is a matter of fact that they are unable to deal with pandemics because the resources to do so are simply absent (Balkhy 2008; Hanvoravongchai et al. 2010; Lai 2012b; Oshitani et al. 2008). Meanwhile, there are evidences which suggest that surge capacity alone is not the full answer. For example, during the SARS outbreak, abundant resources contribute an important but not all-encompassing element in the fight against these pandemics. As it turned out, when different stakeholders brought to the task-at-hand their unique skill sets and resources, they actually complicated the fight due to their lack of synergy. In fact, abundant resources without synergy might even undermine collaborative efforts. Therefore, it is essential that the ability to link up various stakeholders must be complemented by some type of synergy between them. Such ability can be enhanced through close collaboration. This brings us to the third implication for disaster management: collaborative governance at regional level.",

Therefore, it is clear that collaborative capacity of various stakeholders is central to the fight against transboundary communicable diseases (Lai 2011; Lai 2012b; Leung and Nicoll 2010; Voo and Capps 2010). While member states that are of advanced economic development typically lead such efforts, the inclusion of other developing countries, non-traditional agencies, and organizations (including non-governmental ones) is necessary and ultimately, inevitable. Indeed, major countermeasures such as border control and surveillance are often made possible with the aid of regional collaboration.

The ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response (AADMER) provides a comprehensive regional framework to strengthen preventive, monitoring and mitigation measures to reduce disaster losses in the region. In recent years, Singapore has been active in providing training and education for disaster managers from neighboring countries. Singapore has an ongoing exchange program with a number of Asia Pacific nations and Europe.
