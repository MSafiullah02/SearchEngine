            "text": "International adoptees often face challenges that can affect their transition to their new families. Some of these include language barriers, cultural differences, and environmental changes, which may result in disturbances in sleeping, eating, and overall behavior. Many adoptees will be malnourished and developmentally delayed.9, 10, 11, 12 In addition, life in institutionalized settings with limited caregiver involvement can result in self-stimulatory behaviors and altered responses to new sensory stimuli. Without knowledge of these issues, the initial presentation of some children can cause concern for the caregiver unfamiliar with internationally adopted children who have just arrived to the United States. While the transition of living in an orphanage to joining a loving family is often a difficult transition for internationally adopted children, it is also important to realize that the parents\u2019 transition is often just as difficult. Parents are often physically and emotionally exhausted and frequently lack confidence in their role as new parents. Awareness of these issues can provide insight into the psychological state of the family so that the best care can be provided. Because parents often have little command of their child\u2019s birth language, it is often difficult to obtain information about the child\u2019s symptoms. Utilizing interpreter services, especially for children two years and older, can be extremely helpful.",

Because of the high prevalence of intestinal parasites and tuberculosis in resource-poor countries and the lack of perinatal screening for hepatitis B, syphilis, and HIV, international adoptees are at increased risk for these infections.7 The importance of an initial screening evaluation was demonstrated in a study where 67% of internationally adopted children were diagnosed with hepatitis B, intestinal pathogens, or tuberculosis.13 Most of these infections were only identified by doing these screening tests since infections with tuberculosis, hepatitis B, syphilis, and intestinal parasites are often asymptomatic. The American Academy of Pediatric\u2019s Committee on Infectious Diseases recommends that international adoptees be screened for these infections shortly after arrival to the United States (Table 1).\n7 In addition, specialists in the field have recommended other tests be done as well.3, 6, 13, 14, 15, 16 Some children may not have had their initial evaluation, thus the ED physician should determine whether testing has been done, and if not, these screening tests should be completed or recommended to the family. Other testing may be indicated based on the child\u2019s symptoms and clinical findings as well as the child\u2019s country of origin and other risk factors identified from their past medical history.",

While lower respiratory tract infections may be caused by common viral or bacterial pathogens, tuberculosis must also be considered in any internationally adopted child with pneumonia.

An adherent membrane over the tonsils, pharynx, or nose can be seen on physical examination. Symptoms may progress to diffuse cervical lymphadenitis or neck swelling with complications of upper airway obstruction, toxic myocarditis, and peripheral neuropathies. The diagnosis is made by obtaining cultures from the nose, throat, or mucous membrane lesions. The laboratory should be notified if there is a suspicion of diphtheria since special media and precautions are required.7 If the diagnosis is strongly suspected, local public health officials should be notified. Because infection can lead to rapid clinical deterioration, any clinical diagnosis or suspicion warrants administration of a single dose of equine antitoxin. In addition, erythromycin or penicillin should be given for a 14-day course.7\n",

The paroxysmal stage follows with sudden recurrent coughing episodes interspersed with inspiratory whoops. The diagnosis is made by obtaining a specimen from the nasopharynx by aspiration or swab for culture on special medium.7, 32 A direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA) can be done, but it is not as reliable as culture as there is variable sensitivity and low specificity.7 Polymerase chain reaction assays are available and can provide rapid and sensitive results.7 Lymphocytosis in a child with clinical symptoms of pertussis supports the diagnosis. Erythromycin estolate is the treatment of choice; however, azithromycin or clarithromycin may be as effective and may have fewer side effects with increased compliance. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for contacts.7\n",

The number of international adoptees with measles has increased from 2% (1 case) in 1997 to 20% (10 cases) in 2001 in the United States.18 In 2001, an outbreak of 14 measles cases occurred in international adoptees from China, their family members, and close contacts.18 Because measles is so infrequently encountered in the United States, physicians need to be aware of the clinical findings of measles and have a high index of suspicion in any foreign-born child with a fever and rash. The classic presentation is fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, an erythematous maculopapular rash, and pathognomonic enanthemas known as Koplik spots.7 Children may also have otitis media, bronchopneumonia, croup, diarrhea, and acute encephalitis.7 A rare post-infectious neurologic complication of measles, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, was reported in an adoptee from Thailand 9 years after arrival in the US.19 The initial diagnosis of measles is made on clinical grounds and is confirmed by obtaining a single IgM serum antibody test for measles.7 Treatment is supportive, however Vitamin A supplementation is recommended for children 6 months to 2 years of age who are hospitalized with measles or its complications.7\n",

In international adoptees, rates have been highest among Romanian adoptees from the early 1990s where 53% had markers of past or present hepatitis B infection and 20% of children had active infection.21 More recent studies have consistently shown a 3% to 5% prevalence of HBV in international adoptees.2, 5, 11, 14, 21 Adoptees are most often infected from their birth mothers and are therefore at high risk of having chronic infection. Acquisition can also occur from exposure in the orphanage or from blood products or contaminated needles. Children are commonly asymptomatic and are therefore only identified through serologic screening. Initial serologic testing should include hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), and hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb). Children with HBsAb alone have evidence of HBV immunization. Those with HBsAg and HBcAb have either acute or chronic HBV infection. The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B infection is made if the HBsAg persists for greater than 6 months. Children with HBsAb and HBcAb have recovered HBV infection and are not contagious and do not need further immunization. Because HBV has a long incubation period, negative serology may not reflect infection just before immigration; therefore, repeat testing 6 months after arrival to the United States is recommended.7 If a child is found to have hepatitis B infection, it is important to assess whether there have been any exposures and whether prophylaxis is needed. In addition, plans should be made to assure all family members have been immunized. Children with chronic hepatitis B infection should be referred to and managed by a pediatric hepatologist. Therapy with interferon-alpha and lamivudine have been effective in some patients with chronic hepatitis B infection but appear to be less effective in infections acquired during early childhood.7\n",

Screening recommendations include serologic testing for both HIV-1 and HIV-2 shortly after arrival to the United States with consideration for repeat testing 6 months later with antibody-based assays.7\n",

While intestinal parasites are felt to be more prevalent than bacterial infections or viral infections, the latter have not been systematically examined in adoptees. The prevalence of intestinal parasites has varied from 9% to 51%, depending on age and country of origin, with an increased risk in older children and children originating from countries other than Korea.2, 5, 11, 14, 21\nGiardia lamblia is the most commonly identified pathogen in all series, with as many as 19% of children infected.2 The highest rates of Giardia were in children from Eastern Europe (Bulgaria 67%; Romania 50%; Moldova 36%) with lower rates in Russia (25%) and China (15%). Other protozoal infections include Blastocystis hominis, Dientamoeba fragilis, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Entamoeba histolytica.2, 11, 14, 21 Helminth infections are seen less often but include Hymenolepis species (tapeworm) and Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura (roundworms).2, 11, 14, 21, 44 A number of non-pathogenic parasites may also be identified through ova and parasite testing2, 14, 45\n(Table 3). While these pathogens do not require treatment, they should prompt further evaluation for pathogenic parasites. Children with intestinal parasites may be asymptomatic or have symptoms ranging from acute watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, or protracted intermittent diarrhea with foul-smelling stools, flatulence, abdominal distention, and anorexia. Anorexia and malabsorption can lead to weight loss, failure to thrive, and anemia. Asymptomatic infections are common and may not be identified until the adoptee has lived in the United States for some time.33\n",

Although SARS was never identified in international adoptees during this outbreak, the potential for such transmission in a population involving global travel raises the issue as being pertinent to this review, especially with 25% of all adoptees originating from China. The ED may serve as the first medical encounter for patients with this acute infection. Following standard infection control guidelines on a daily basis and being aware of which children are at risk for SARS can help identify children who may have this infection and prevent the spread of disease. Because the clinical features of SARS are indistinguishable from most febrile respiratory illnesses, the clinician will need to base their clinical suspicion of SARS on both clinical and epidemiologic data. Patients with fever and a respiratory illness as well as a history of travel to a SARS-infected area or close contact with a SARS patient meet the case definition as a probable case of SARS requiring further evaluation. If SARS is suspected, there should be a coordinated effort between the child\u2019s physician, infection control, the infectious disease physician, and the clinical laboratory to identify the cause of the child\u2019s illness as well as to assure prevention of transmission. The diagnosis is made through laboratory testing done at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and stool can be performed. Serologic testing can be done within the first week of symptoms.50 Treatment is supportive as there is no specific therapy of proven efficacy.",

However, malaria should always be considered in the differential diagnosis in any febrile child from tropical areas of the world where malaria is endemic Figure 3, Figure 4.\nClassic symptoms of malaria are cyclical high fevers with chills, rigor, sweats, and headache.7, 49 Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, arthralgia, and abdominal and back pain. Signs of malaria include anemia, thrombocytopenia, pallor, jaundice, hypotension, and hepatosplenomegaly.7, 49 The clinical presentation of malaria varies by species type. Plasmodium falciparum infections are seen within the first weeks after arrival and commonly present as a nonspecific febrile illness. Severe complications may occur including cerebral malaria and shock. Patients with other malaria species may present later after arrival. P vivax and P ovale infections commonly manifest as anemia and hypersplenism, while P malariae infections are often asymptomatic or presenting with nephrotic syndrome.",

During a febrile episode, a complete blood count may reveal thrombocytopenia or anemia.49, 51 Electrolytes should be evaluated for hypoglycemia or acidosis associated with complications of respiratory or renal failure and a blood culture obtained to evaluate for bacteremia. Severe malaria is defined as parasitemia with greater than 5% of red blood cells, CNS or end-organ involvement, shock, acidosis, or hypoglycemia. Treatment is based on the infecting species, possible drug resistance, and disease severity. If the species type cannot be determined, treatment for drug-resistant P falciparum should be initiated. Oral therapy can be given if disease is not severe and oral medications can be tolerated. Parenteral treatment should be given for severe malaria until the parasite density decreases to less than 1%.7\n",
