The aim of the ABCDE assessment is to identify most life-threatening problems firstOne of the most prominent systematic approaches for the assessment of seriously ill or injured patients is the ABCDE approach (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure). It can be used from the preclinical assessment on scene, through the arrival at the emergency room, to the re-evaluation on hospital wards or intensive care units. After the first overall impression (skin color, sweating, environment, etc.), systematic assessment is performed following the mnemonic acronym \u201cABCDE\u201d. Potentially life-threatening respiratory problems are considered first, followed by other respiratory issues in the second instance and thereafter hemodynamic problems, etc. (Table 1). Since life-saving measures must be initiated immediately, assessment and treatment accompany each other. After completion of the first ABCDE assessment, it should be repeated until stabilization is achieved. In the event of deterioration, immediate reassessment is necessary [2].",

In the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain, for example, inspection of the abdomen for the presence of Cullen\u2019s sign (superficial edema and bruising in the subcutaneous fatty tissue around the umbilicus) and Grey Turner\u2019s sign (bruising of the flanks) or evaluation of the hands for palmar erythema or white nails can point to either pancreas- or liver-associated disease. The palpation of Lanz\u2019s, McBurney\u2019s and Murphy\u2019s spot helps to distinguish appendicitis from cholecystitis. The evaluation of Meyer\u2019s (pain when palpating the calf), Homan\u2019s (pain in dorsal flexion) or Payer\u2019s (pain caused by medial plantar pressure) signs may not only indicate deep vein thrombosis, but potentially also an associated pulmonary embolism. In a similar manner, Kussmaul\u2019s sign (paradoxical inspiratory pressure increase in the jugular veins) may suggest pericardial effusion, Kussmaul\u2019s breathing suggests metabolic acidosis and a typical \u201cflapping\u201d during pronators drift test may indicate hypercapnia. The extraordinary range of potentially relevant findings and their interpretation require training and expertise [4].",

Early identification of the etiologic pathogen facilitates timely initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy at the Emergency Department [13]. POC blood tests for troponins and D\u2011dimer support timely diagnosis of chest pain of life threatening origin. POC testing of C\u2011reactive protein reveal relevant inflammatory processes. Rapid diagnostic tests allow for the reliable detection of Plasmodium antigens in the blood of febrile patients who have recently returned from tropical countries and are thus a valuable adjunct to microscopy for the early diagnosis of malaria. Similarly, several POC diagnostic assays are available for the detection of dengue virus. Secretion samples and smears can likewise provide clinically essential information; widely used guaiac-based stool-blood tests allow instant detection of fecal occult blood in human stool (e.g. in patients presenting to the ED with anemia of unknown origin) [13\u201317]. Nasopharyngeal specimens can be examined for the presence of Influenza A and B virus nucleoprotein antigens [18], respiratory syncytial fusion protein or Streptococcus pyogenes group A antigens within minutes. In patients with suspected meningitis, rapid fully automated multiplex PCR assays with turnaround times of only 1 h provide fast discrimination between bacterial and viral pathogens.",

Less clear ECG findings make ischemia diagnosis more difficult, delay therapy and may increase the risk of substantial myocardial damage.

It shows a 100% sensitivity for the identification of patients with LVEF <30% at a cut-off of >7 mm [35]. More sophisticated quantitative methods are made possible using Doppler-based methods. The Doppler phenomenon enables the echocardiographic representation of blood flow velocities. Pulsed (PW) Doppler measurements quantify velocities at certain points, whereas continuous (CW) Doppler measurements enable quantification of the overall flow velocity. Thus, cardiac output can be calculated from the integral of the LV outflow velocity time (LVOT-VTI) and the aortic valve opening area (AVA) [36].",

Conversely, a diastolic collapse of the RV indicates significant pericardial tamponade with high specificity (75% to 90%) but low sensitivity. It occurs when the intrapericardial pressure exceeds the intracardiac filling pressure; M\u2011mode through the RV free wall and the anterior leaf of the mitral valve enables imaging. Further, PW Doppler signals can be used to detect abnormal inflow velocities [28, 47]. PW Doppler signals usually show a restrictive LV and RV diastolic filling pattern, characterized by a high early velocity (E), a shortened deceleration time, and a reduced atrial wave (A). Often, but not always, mitral inflow velocity falls by as much as 25% to 40%, and tricuspid velocity greatly increases (> 40% to 60%) during? the first beat after inspiration [28].",

It is recommended as an initial diagnostic test for patients with a medium to high pre-test probability of DVT in the lower extremities [2]. The full compressibility of the femoral or knee veins most probably excludes thrombosis at this level [64]. In emergency medicine, three point compression techniques are usually applied to the areas with the highest probability (femoral, popliteal and calf veins) [64\u201367]. With a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 90%, quality levels close to a systematic radiological examination can be achieved with appropriate training in an emergency setting [63]. Vascular ultrasound also plays an important role in the non-invasive assessment of occlusive diseases of the arteries. Both B\u2011mode and Doppler methods provide information about the local conditions [62]. In addition to diagnostics, vascular imaging improves both safety and quality of puncture for central venous access in comparison to the use of anatomical features alone [68].",
