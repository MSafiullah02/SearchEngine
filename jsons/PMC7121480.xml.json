At the time, he was not aware of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 or the illness it causes (Covid-19). As the symptoms persisted, he decided to visit a private primary care clinic in Bangkok on January 23. The body temperature was 36.8\u00b0C (98\u00b0F). The clinic physician ordered a throat swab for influenza A and B; the swab was negative for both strains. Additional medications were prescribed for treatment of the patient\u2019s symptoms.",
