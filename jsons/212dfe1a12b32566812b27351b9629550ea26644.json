These include Nipah virus, Menangle virus, Hendra virus, and Australian bat lyssavirus. Evidence suggests that megachiropteran bats are carriers of Ebola virus [5] , and Rhinolophid bats, which are closely related to the megachiropterans, are carriers of SARS-like coronaviruses [1, 6, 7] .

Currently, serum neutralization assays are the most common tests used to detect the presence of antibodies to specific pathogens in bats, and are accepted as the reference standard [11] . However, serum neutralization assays require days to weeks for results, and require virus culture, which is labor intensive, slow, and involves live virus culture, representing a risk to personnel.
