            "text": "Tropical Asia is the homeland for slightly more than 169.4 million of the total world population of 178.2 million domestic buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) estimated in 2006. Domestic buffaloes in Asia are of two types: the swamp type for draught in the eastern half of Asia and the river type for milk in the western half of Asia. The river-type buffaloes, the once-neglected farm species, currently produce about 73.2 million tonnes of milk annually from some of the world's best buffalo breeds in India and Pakistan. They breed throughout the year, conceive at 250\u2013275 kg body weight, calve for the first time at 3\u20135 years of age following a gestation period of 305\u2013320 days, and produce two calves every 3 years. Lactating animals are fed mainly on straw, crop residues, and mineral supplements such as urea\u2013molasses\u2013mineral block (UMMB). In most rural areas, animals are hand-milked twice daily and the calf is used to stimulate milk letdown. The lactation period is 200\u2013300 days with first lactation milk yields of 1500\u2013800 kg. Breeding females are retained in the herd until about the ninth lactation (16 years of age) with reasonable economic returns. River buffaloes are vulnerable to most infectious and metabolic diseases affecting cattle. In India and Pakistan, milk is marketed through a network of milk cooperatives, which guarantee a stable price throughout the year for the farmer. Buffalo milk contains twice as much butterfat as cow milk. Besides ghee, several other products are manufactured from buffalo milk, such as butter, cheese, full cream milk powder, skim milk powder, and infant milk powder. Thus, the domestic buffalo is emerging as an alternative source for the manufacture of dairy products worldwide.",

The lower water and higher fat contents make buffalo milk better suited for the manufacture of fat-based and solid non-fat (SNF)-based milk products, such as cheese, butterfat, many kinds of traditional pastries, candies as well as ice cream, ghee, and milk powder (Table 6\n). In fact, swamp buffalo milk has higher fat (9\u201315%), protein (7.1%), lactose (4.9%), and ash (0.89%) contents. In general, calcium, iron, and phosphorus contents are higher in buffalo milk than in cow milk. The lower cholesterol content in buffalo milk should make it more popular than cow milk in the health-conscious public.",
