This structure provides an exchange interface between maternal and fetal blood, thereby establishing a nutrient supply to the fetus [1]. Despite the syncytins' key role in placental morphogenesis and likely in a number of pregnancy diseases [2], as well as their involvement in osteoclast fusion during bone formation [3], they remain poorly characterized molecularly. The syncytin genes are among the numerous endogenous retroviral elements [4] that account for 8% of the human genome [5]. Although the majority of such elements have accumulated mutations and sequence rearrangements that make them non-functional, some have preserved their open reading frames due to selective advantages for the host. The syncytins are prime examples of such appropriations, involving domestication of the retroviral genes coding for the viral envelope protein (Env), which mediates fusion of the viral lipid envelope with the plasma membrane of target cells during entry.",

They have been the product of independent endogenization events, with the earliest syncytin capture envisioned as the driving force behind the evolution of egg-laying vertebrates into placental mammals [1]. In humans, there are two syncytins, syncytin-1 and syncytin-2 (syn1 and syn2), that derive from the env genes of the human endogenous retroviruses W and FRD (HERV-W and HERV-FRD), respectively [8]. Both are gamma-retroviruses [9] that entered the human genome around 25 and 45 million years ago, respectively [10], [11], [12]. Human syncytins possess a gamma-type Env protein, which is present not only in gamma-retroviruses but also in delta-, alpha-, and in a subset of the beta-retroviruses [13].",

Class I proteins are type 1 single-pass transmembrane proteins that fold in the endoplasmic reticulum of the infected cell as a precursor that in most cases trimerizes directly upon folding. An activating proteolytic step cleaves the precursor in two - an N-terminal portion, termed \u201csurface\u201d subunit (SU) in retroviruses - which in general has a receptor binding function, and a C-terminal subunit, which carries the membrane fusion function and is termed \u201ctrans-membrane\u201d (TM) subunit, as it includes the trans-membrane anchor (TMA) near its C-terminal end (Fig. 1\nA). The SU subunit remains peripherally associated and in some cases is covalently linked to TM by a disulfide bond [13]. Cleavage of the precursor into SU and TM traps the complex in a metastable state (the \u201cpre-fusion\u201d form), with the TM subunit spring-loaded underneath a crown made by SU. Interactions with target cells induce the release of the SU crown, allowing TM to spring out and undergo a major conformational change that drives membrane fusion [15]. A specific feature of the gamma-type Env proteins is the presence of two cysteine-rich motifs in the primary sequence, CXXC in SU and CX6CC in TM (where X is any aa), which control formation of an inter-subunit disulfide bond in the pre-fusion form that is reduced upon interaction with a receptor to release SU and induce the fusogenic conformational change in TM required for entry [16].",

The fusogenic conformational change entails first projection of the fusion peptide to a distance about 10 nm or more away from its original location, such that it can reach and insert into the target cell membrane. In this transient conformation, the TM protein has the N- and C-termini at opposite ends of a long trimeric rod, thereby bridging viral and cellular membranes at a distance of about 15 nm [17]. The trimer protomers bend in half, adopting a \u201chairpin\u201d conformation that brings the N- and C-terminal ends of the TM ectodomain (TME) into contact, forcing apposition of the two membranes at a distance within 1 nm. The conformational change of TM thus lowers a kinetic barrier arising from short-range repulsive forces between the two membranes - resulting from the necessary dehydration of both outer leaflets to allow inter-membrane lipid contacts [18] - to catalyze lipid merger.",

These structures showed a long \u03b1-helix (termed N-helix) immediately downstream of the fusion peptide, which forms a characteristic central, parallel trimeric \u03b1-helical coiled-coil. The amino acid sequence in this region has characteristic heptad repeats (HRs), represented as positions abcdefg (Fig. 1B), where a and d are typically occupied by apolar amino acids that form the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil. Downstream the N-helix, the polypeptide chain makes an overall 180\u00b0 turn, such that the C-terminal segment runs backward, antiparallel to the coiled-coil and inserting an \u03b1-helix (the \u201cC-helix\u201d) along the grooves in-between the long N-helices in the trimer to complete the hairpin. The resulting 6-helix bundle (6HB) thus has the C-terminal segment connecting to the trans-membrane anchors in proximity of the fusion peptides projecting from the N-terminal end. The structure of the pre-fusion form of the retroviral Env ectodomain, in which the N-helix is broken into several short helices to maintain a more compact form underneath the SU crown, remains a challenge. HIV-1, which has a \u201cbeta-type\u201d Env, is the only retrovirus for which pre-fusion Env structure is known (reviewed in Refs. [26], [27]). In this case, as with other class I fusion proteins, the introduction of mutations interfering with formation of the post-fusion 6HB were necessary to stabilize the pre-fusion trimer and make it accessible to structural studies [28].",

We present here the structures of the complete syn2- and syn1-TME in post-fusion conformation, which allowed us to perform structural comparisons of syncytins with other class I fusion proteins, confirming the anticipated structural homology to the retroviral gamma-type Envs and also to GP2 fusion subunit of filoviruses and reptarenaviruses. Our results identified a vertical string of 9 salt bridges crisscrossing the N-terminal part of the N-helix and the C-terminal part of the C-helix, found in syn1 and not in syn2, in line with the higher thermal stability measured for syn1-TME. The new structures, together with their close structural homology with the filovirus counterparts, guided further functional studies with full-length syn1 variants carrying helix-breaker proline substitutions along the N-helix region. We thus identified locations in which the proline appeared to block formation of the post-fusion form - as monitored by their loss of function in a syncytium formation assay - but remained compatible with folding in the spring-loaded pre-fusion form as they were trafficked to the cell surface as efficiently as wild-type protein.",

We used structural information available for a number of postfusion retroviral TME conformations [22], [24], [25] together with aa sequence alignments and secondary structure/hydrophobicity plots [30], [31] to define the boundaries of the constructs we used for the structural studies. These analyses (Fig. S1) suggested that the fusion peptide spans the TM N-terminal 23\u201324 aa and that the HRs begin 6-7 residues downstream, encompassing around 48 aa in total for both syncytins. The N-terminal end in the previously reported X-ray structure of a syn2-TME fragment [29] was about 10 residues downstream these predictions, suggesting that the N-helix was truncated. In the C-terminal segment, our predictions indicated a roughly 25-residue long \u03b1-helix downstream the characteristic gamma-type Env CX6CC motif, which would correspond to a C-helix that was absent in the reported syn2-TME structure (Figs. 1A and 2\n; PDB accession code 1Y4M\n[29]). A relatively hydrophobic element is present between the predicted C-helix and the TMA, most likely corresponding to the amphipathic membrane-proximal external region (MPER) identified in a number of other retroviral Env proteins. From these analyses, we designed expression vectors for a recombinant TME core, termed here syn1-TME (residues 342\u2013435) and syn2-TME (residues 375\u2013468) starting immediately downstream of the fusion peptide and ending before the putative MPER (Fig. 1B).",

Upon purification by nickel affinity followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), we obtained yields of about 30 mg of each protein per liter of cell culture. Both proteins formed trimers with a molecular mass of ~36 kDa as judged from their SEC elution profiles (data not shown). Syn1-TME crystallized in a rhombohedral space group (H32), and the crystals, which contained one protomer in the asymmetric unit, diffracted to 2.1 \u00c5 resolution. Syn2-TME formed trigonal crystals (space group P3221) that diffracted to 2.2 \u00c5 and had a trimer in the asymmetric unit. The corresponding structures were determined by molecular replacement using the truncated syn2-TME structure as search model (PDB accession number 1Y4M). The final map displayed clear electron density for residues 345\u2013433 in the crystals of syn1-TME, with the first three and last two residues of the construct being disordered. For syn2-TME, the trimer is local, and residues 380\u2013465 are resolved in all three chains of the trimer, with individual protomers displaying additional N- or C-terminal extensions ordered because of stabilization by crystal packing contacts. The atomic models were refined to the maximum resolution of the diffraction data to Rwork/Rfree of 0.22/0.24 and 0.21/0.26 for syn1- and syn2-TME, respectively. The statistics concerning the structure determination and refinement of the atomic model are listed in Table S1. The crystallographic details are described in the Materials and Methods section.",

Belt 1 involves the side chains of several glutamine residues in syn1 and syn2. In the 6HB of MPMV and XMRV TME, numerous electrostatic interactions were described between charged residues mapping to the same region (Fig. 3D) [22]. In addition, the syn1 6HB contains a string of 8 inter-chain and 1 intra-chain salt bridges that tie the first 5 turns of the N-helix to the C-helix of the adjacent protomer in a vertical fashion, i.e. by establishing numerous successive inter-chain and intra-chain contacts (Fig. 3B). The corresponding residues in the C-helix of the syn2 6HB are uncharged (Fig. S2, Fig. 3D), and therefore no salt bridge is formed. Instead, the syn2 6HB features two different salt bridges, one inter- and one intra-chain, in the upper half of the bundle (Fig. 3C, Table S3). Akin to what we observe here in syn2, electrostatic interactions also clip the termini of the N- and C-helices of MPMV and XMRV at the open end of the hairpin, although they are more dispersed and less numerous (1 and 2, respectively) (Fig. 3D).",

A direct test of the role of the residues involved in these interactions by site-directed mutagenesis is complicated by the fact that the 6HB forms only after the fusogenic conformational change, and the lack of functionality of any given point mutant could also be because of an alternative interaction in the pre-fusion form.

The single residue responsible for the ISU properties of syn2 (Gln427) resides in the \u03b7T helix (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Syn1, which does not have ISU properties, has R393 at the corresponding position. Another residue located in the syn2-TME T-loop, A433, is important for its fusion activity, and only the simultaneous introduction of these two mutations into syn1, R393Q and F399A (Fig. 1B), converts syn1 into a functional protein with both ISU and fusogenic activities [37]. These pairs of residues, Q427 and A433 in syn2-TME, are conserved in MPMV (Q471, A477), while a glutamic acid replaces the glutamine in XMRV (E526) (Fig. 2). Although syn1 is not immunosuppressive, the main chain conformation in the region spanning the ISU is the same as in syn2, MPMV, and XMRV, which all have functional ISU properties.",

[14]), and the breaks in the N-helix in the spring-loaded form have been mapped. In several of these structures, including filoviral GP, the break points were found downstream of a special turn in the N-helix that makes a \u201cstutter\u201d in the central coiled-coil. Stutters are defined as HR disruptions in the form of 4-residue insertions in between two HRs [46] and are found in most alpha-helical coiled-coils. The stutter-induced deviation from the ideal geometry results in local unwinding of the coiled-coil superhelix, and while the helical axes are almost straight for the first three turns of the N-helix, their twist becomes evident as the coil progresses towards the C-terminus (Fig. 2). Stutters have been proposed to impart structural plasticity to regions that function as conformational switches [39], in agreement with their potential to suggest possible sites for spring-loading the N-helix. Analysis of the coiled-coil by program TWISTER [47] revealed the presence of a stutter at the 3rd turn of the N-helix in both syncytin structures, residues 354LNGD357 in syn1 and 388IANN391 in syn2-TME (Figs. 1B and 2). A stutter is present at the same location in the 6HB of MPMV, XMRV, and BLV, as well as in CASV, two helical turns upstream in HTLV and two turns downstream in the filovirus GP2 6HB (Fig. S2).",

These cells constitutively express the syn1 receptor, the alanine\u2013serine\u2013cysteine transporter 2 molecule, which is required for syn1-driven cell\u2013cell fusion [53]. As expected, the GFP signal appeared in the cells transfected with wild-type syn1, indicative of its fusogenicity (Fig. 6\n, Fig. 7\nA). In contrast, no GFP signal was detected when transfected with the proline variants, including those that underwent efficient trafficking to the cell surface, indicating that the mutants were unable to induce cell\u2013cell fusion because they could not form the required 6HB. The variants carrying N382 mutations did induce GFP signal, although at \u226420% of what was observed for the wild-type syn1. N382D was more active than N382A and N382L, which showed essentially no fusion activity (Figs. 6 and 7A, Fig. S4), similar to what was observed when asparagine to aspartic acid or leucine mutations were introduced into BLV TME\n[25].

They also revealed close similarity to the more distant fusion GPs of the filoviruses MARV and EBOV, and of the filovirus-like CASV. The two polar layers described in the structures of the XMRV and MPMV TME\n[22] are also present in the syncytins and have their counterpart in the 6HB of all the proteins mentioned above. A number of these polar interactions on the MPMV and XMRV 6HB were tested by site-directed mutagenesis and shown to interfere with the fusion activity of the corresponding full-length protein [22]. The same residues, however, can potentially be involved in a different set of interactions in the pre-fusion form, and it is therefore difficult to draw strong conclusions about their specific role in stabilization of the post-fusion 6HB and its relation to the membrane fusogenic activity of the protein. Our studies also confirmed that the core TME fragment of syn2 reported back in 2005 [29] was truncated roughly at half the length of the protein core (Fig. 2), similar to the first described structure of a gamma-retroviral protein in the post fusion form of the murine Moloney leukemia virus reported 23 years ago [19] on which the construct had been based. In those structures, only the second polar belt was present, and as the C-helix was absent, there was no 6HB in the trimer.",

            "text": "To fully understand the role of the polar residues observed stabilizing the 6HB, it is important to also know the structure of the spring-loaded, (SU/TME)3 prefusion form. No such structure is available for any gamma-type retroviral Env protein, and the available structure of the beta-type HIV-1 Env protein is too distant to be a useful guide. In contrast, the structure of the fusion GP of the EBOV and MARV filoviruses in the pre-fusion (GP1/GP2E)3 spring-loaded trimer is available; in the filovirus GP, GP1 and GP2 are equivalent to the retroviral SU and TM subunits, respectively. The high structural similarity of the post-fusion GP2E 6HB suggests that the region spanning the N-helix in the gamma-type retroviral Env proteins can potentially undergo a similar change in going from the pre-fusion to the post-fusion conformation. Our helix-breaking proline-scanning mutagenesis studies, targeting the a and d positions of the HR downstream of the stutter, identified that proline residues can be introduced at turns 6 and 7 of the N-helix (mutants L365P, L368P, L372P; Fig. 5A) without interfering with full-length syn1 being transported to the surface of the transfected cells. This observation strongly indicates that the mutants were well-folded and consequently had passed the folding quality control system of the cell, which was not the case for the proline mutants engineered further upstream (Y347P, L350P, L354P, M358P at turns 1\u20133 i.e. between the N-terminus and the stutter) or downstream (L375P and L379P at turns 8 and 9, closer to belt 2), which led to decreased transport to the cell surface (Fig. S3).",

Remarkably, this region is also located two turns downstream of the stutter. The GP1 moiety of the filovirus GP is, however, most likely unrelated to the gamma-retrovirus SU, as the two fusion proteins have very different properties. For instance, filoviruses enter cells by fusion in late endosomes, and the EBOV GP requires further proteolytic cleavage of GP1 by cellular cathepsins after uptake into a target cell, partially removing the GP1 crown [57]. The remainder of GP1 then interacts with a second internal receptor upon this cleavage, the Niemann\u2013Pick C1 protein [58], and fusion ensues only at this late-stage membrane. As a result, the pre-fusion form of the filovirus (GP1/GP2E)3 spike is particularly robust, and no additional stabilization was necessary for the structural studies. The removal of the mucin-like domain, which is heavily glycosylated, and complexation with neutralizing antibody fragments served to improve crystal packing but were not required for stabilization of the pre-fusion conformation per se [43], [44]. In contrast, the syncytins act directly at the plasma membrane, and the fusion trigger is the interaction with their cell-surface receptor (reviewed in Ref. [59]). In this sense, they are more like the beta-type HIV-1 Env protein, which similarly drives fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane for entry. The syncytins are also reminiscent of the paramyxoviruses and pneumoviruses, which also induce fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membranes. These viral fusion proteins all required mutagenesis to maintain them in the pre-fusion form to maintain conformational epitopes to use as immunogens and to carry out structural studies [49], [50]. An initial structure of the pre-fusion form, however, guided those trials. With the syncytins, we have worked backward, devising trials by explicit homology of the postfusion form without any information of the pre-fusion form. Our results nonetheless now point to new ways of engineering the pre-fusion form of gamma-type retroviral Env proteins, using mutants with helix-breaking residues in the identified region of the N-helix to destabilize the post-fusion form. Such a strategy may also require further mutations directly stabilizing the pre-fusion state, in addition to those in the region identified here. Possible combinations include the SU/TM CXXC/CX6CC motif to lock the inter-subunit disulfide bond and avoid shedding of the SU subunit, and also the addition of a trimerization motif to keep the pre-fusion trimer together for a high-resolution structural characterization.",
