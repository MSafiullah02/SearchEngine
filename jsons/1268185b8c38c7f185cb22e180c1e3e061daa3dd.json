Although they generally behave as transient or permanent commensals, they can occasionally cause life-threatening pneumonia (Pneumocystis pneumonia; PCP) in immunosuppressed individuals. Several decades ago, the presence of Pneumocystis morphotypes (trophic forms and cysts) was described in the lungs of normal cats and cats with experimentally induced symptomatic PCP (after immunosuppression by corticosteroids); yet to date spontaneous or drug-induced PCP has not been described in the clinical feline literature, despite immunosuppression of cats by long-standing retrovirus infections or after kidney transplantation. In this study, we describe the presence of Pneumocystis DNA in the lungs of normal cats (that died of various unrelated causes; n = 84) using polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) targeting the mitochondrial small and large subunit ribosomal RNA gene (mtSSU rRNA and mtLSU rRNA). The presence of Pneumocystis DNA was confirmed by sequencing in 24/84 (29%) cats, with evidence of two different sequence types (or lineages). Phylogenetically, lineage1 (L1; 19 cats) and lineage 2 (L2; 5 cats) formed separate clades, clustering with Pneumocystis from domestic pigs (L1) and carnivores (L2), respectively. Results of the present study support the notion that cats can be colonized or subclinically infected by Pneumocystis, without histological evidence of damage to the pulmonary parenchyma referable to pneumocystosis. Pneumocystis seems most likely an innocuous pathogen of cats' lungs, but its possible role in the exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disorders or viral/bacterial coinfections should be considered further in a clinical setting.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The genus Pneumocystis is used to describe related fungi that have evolved to live in the lower respiratory tract of mammals. 1 They are transmitted by aerosols, with animals typically becoming infected during the neonatal period, resulting in persistent, sometimes lifelong infections. 2, 3 They generally are believed to be transient or permanent commensals, colonizing very limited portions of the lungs, while causing minimal or no damage to the host. 4, 5 Pneumocystis is highly adapted for an existence in host lung, with strict dependence on its mammalian host for nutrients and a stable environment, while utilizing efficient strategies for immune evasion, thereby facilitating persistence in its host. The Pneumocystis genomes sequenced to date have all demonstrated a contracted genome compared to those of other closely related fungi, revealing adaptative mechanisms to live exclusively in mammalian hosts, very similar to a parasite/host relationship. 6, 7 This group of fungi does, however, have the potential to behave as an opportunistic pathogen in certain settings, such as severe malnutrition (e.g., in child refugees after the Second World War), immunosuppressive drug therapy (e.g., after solid organ transplantation) or inherited or acquired immunodeficiency states (including AIDS due to long-standing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection). 3, 8 Generally, Pneumocystis species show great host selectivity, such that every mammalian group studied has only one or two specific Pneumocystis species with which it is strongly associated. 6, 9 Pneumocystis has the capacity to cause life-threatening pneumonia (Pneumocystis pneumonia; PCP) in immunosuppressed individuals, including human transplant recipients, patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs (corticosteroids, methotrexate, azathioprine, calcineurin inhibitors, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 [TNF\u03b1] antagonists, etc.) and patients with HIV/AIDS. [10] [11] [12] The parallelism between HIV/AIDS in human patients and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection in cats has been considered in relation to the pathogenesis of feline pneumocystosis, although no association could be established. 13 Perhaps more surprisingly, the same is true of the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). 14 Spontaneous PCP in cats has not been reported. Cats receiving renal transplants, for example, have never developed PCP despite being susceptible to numerous other opportunistic pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptococcus neoformans/ Cryptococcus gattii because of prednisone and cyclosporine administration. 15 PCP can, however, be produced in contrived experimental settings. 16 Pneumocystis in cats was first described by investigators in Mexico and Denmark from 1950 to 1980 [17] [18] [19] (reviewed in  Table 1 ) based on characteristic morphology of trophic forms and cysts in feline lung specimens. There was no evidence of symptomatic PCP in these cats, which therefore were considered to be colonized or infected subclinically. Later, a small number of studies investigated cats as potential animal models for Pneumocystis infection, probably drawing upon the notion that cats might be susceptible to recrudescent Pneumocystis infection, as they are to toxoplasmosis following reactivation of Toxoplasma gondii bradyzoite cysts. In these studies, cats were administered extremely high doses of corticosteroids, and as a result, a proportion of them developed PCP pneumonia 16, 20 (Table 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 126, "end": 127, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 287, "end": 289, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 290, "end": 291, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 456, "end": 458, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 459, "end": 460, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 964, "end": 966, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 967, "end": 968, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1371, "end": 1373, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1374, "end": 1375, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1565, "end": 1567, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1568, "end": 1569, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1929, "end": 1933, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1934, "end": 1938, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1939, "end": 1943, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2170, "end": 2172, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2261, "end": 2263, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2581, "end": 2583, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2650, "end": 2652, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2751, "end": 2755, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2756, "end": 2760, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2761, "end": 2765, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3454, "end": 3457, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3458, "end": 3460, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2766, "end": 2787, "text": "(reviewed in  Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 3461, "end": 3470, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Although lower airway disease in cats has been studied extensively in companion animal medicine using modalities including radiology, computed tomography, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytology, microbiology, and examination of lung tissues at biopsy or necropsy, no clinical cases of pneumonia due to Pneumocystis occurring in cats have been described in the clinical veterinary literature to the best of our knowledge.

The same observations have been made in human autopsy studies, in which Pneumocystis jirovecii can be detected without observation of obvious pulmonary lesions in immunocompetent infants. 2, 30 This might be a reflection of our study representing a single time-point analysis, whereas a sequential analysis using detailed microscopic morphometry to follow the course of Pneumocystis infection, including younger kittens during the primary stage of infection, would permit detection of Pneumocystis-associated pathology. Indeed, a recent rodent model study documented that subclinical primary Pneumocystis infection can induce progressive pathologic changes characteristic of airway disease in immunocompetent hosts, such as increased mucus production and thickening of the airway epithelium. 31 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular genetic investigation that describes Pneumocystis in cats or other felids using sequence-based PCR methodology. In 1999, Cho and colleagues 20 established that there were at least three distinct karyotype groups of Pneumocystis among mammals in Korea. Furthermore, it was shown that chromosomal band size for cat isolates resembled dog isolates but were larger than rat isolates (730 bp for cat/dog vs 300-700 bp for rat). The chromosomal band in cats and dogs was therefore the first band of Pneumocystis over 700 bp to be described. 20 Finding two distinct Pneumocystis lineages in cats is consistent with the heterogeneity seen in other animal species, where co-infection with different Pneumocystis ST (or species) in each mammalian host is well described, especially in rodents. 32 Only one ST lineage was found in any given cat. The two novel Pneumocystis lineages represented by our phylogenetic trees do not correspond to known Pneumocystis species or ST.

Thus, the natural route for transmission of Pneumocystis is most likely queen (mother) to kitten, and this would impact on the evolution of Pneumocystis in cats. On the other hand, it seems plausible that Pneumocystis from rodents (rats and mice), the natural prey of cats, might \"cross over\" during predation, although our data and the generally accepted species specificity of Pneumocystis argue against such a proposition. This is of course quite different from the situation when cats live in domesticated or semidomesticated life situations in close association with human society, where cat-to-cat transmission within households, or in areas where cats congregate outside (e.g., rubbish tips, cat shelters, and free-roaming colonies) is also possible.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 224, "end": 227, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 228, "end": 230, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In mammals, most Pneumocystis infections seem to consist of benign colonization, perhaps occasionally extending to subclinical disease as a co-pathogen to bacterial or viral primary respiratory pathogens.

The same is true also for macrobats, where, for example, Histoplasma capsulatum coexists with Pneumocystis spp. in many individuals. 45 In contrast, in pigs there seems to be a general tendency that concurrent viral and bacterial infections are less frequently observed in Pneumocystis-positive cases than in Pneumocystis-negative individuals. 29 A negative association between the presence of P. jirovecii and bacterial colonization was also shown in patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. 46 Thus, which factor(s) trigger multiplication of trophic forms and whether a simple infection with Pneumocystis (without the presence of other infectious agents) can induce lung injury and dysfunction appears to be unique in different host-environment-pathogen systems.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 252, "end": 255, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 256, "end": 258, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 436, "end": 438, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 526, "end": 529, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 530, "end": 533, "text": "36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 534, "end": 537, "text": "39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 538, "end": 540, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 862, "end": 866, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 867, "end": 871, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 872, "end": 876, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1031, "end": 1034, "text": "43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1035, "end": 1037, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1183, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1261, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1440, "end": 1442, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1651, "end": 1653, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1810, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the 1980s, cats affected by FeLV, an oncogenic feline retrovirus capable of causing severe acquired immunodeficiency, were studied as a potential animal model for the development of opportunistic infection in AIDS patients. In one study of FeLVinfected cats, acute bronchopneumonia, leukemic infiltrates, interstitial pneumonitis, and adenomatosis were all observed 13 (Table 1) , but despite a concerted search, there was no microscopic evidence for Pneumocystis infection. These findings suggested that Pneumocystis is not commonly a complication of FeLV infection, nor a cause of lethal interstitial pneumonia in cats 13 (Table 1) . Along similar lines, FIV is a very well-studied lentivirus of cats, and despite great scrutiny in both experimental and naturally occurring settings, no association has ever been made between development of PCP and long-standing FIV infection in cats with greatly reduced numbers of circulating CD4 cells. 14 Results of the present study support the notion that cats can be asymptomatically infected by Pneumocystis spp. Such cats are likely to be colonized or subclinically infected but not in association with substantial tissue destruction or injury, and thus with no discernible lung dysfunction. 47 None of the cats investigated in the current study were thought to have pathological pulmonary changes referable to pneumocystosis. As in humans, young cats seem more likely to be Pneumocystis-positive, but no other factors (sex, lifestyle, cause of death, etc.) in this study were associated with colonized cats. In experimental animal model studies, cats have been shown to be less susceptible to Pneumocystis infection when compared with rodents 28 (Table 1) . Indeed, corticosteroid treated cats generally developed only a mild Pneumocystis infection, in marked contradistinction with the heavy symptomatic PCP that developed in corticosteroid treated rats, 28 suggesting that cats are less susceptible to Pneumocystis disease than other mammals. Without evidence of Pneumocystis in a specimen (BAL or lung biopsy) from a cat with respiratory distress and radiological findings consistent with PCP, we cannot confirm or deny any role for Pneumocystis in the pathogenesis of feline lung disease.
