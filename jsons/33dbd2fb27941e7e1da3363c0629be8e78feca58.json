Unfortunately, the host defense mechanisms are very often not sufficient to prevent subsequent/repeated episodes of infection(s). Further insight into the interaction of infectious agent and host immune response, genetic factors, and environmental factors is needed for a better understanding of why humans repeatedly and frequently suffer from infections with respiratory agents and develop a disease syndrome known as common cold.",

However, when considered cumulatively, about 1 year of one's life span may be spent confined to bed, or at least at home, recovering from colds. More importantly, our responses to this infection vary significantly, both intra-and inter-individually. One explanation is that many viruses -over 100 serotypes of rhinovirus alone -cause this illness, thus manifesting disease in different manners. Nevertheless, even the same virus may be asymptomatic, or cause a mild illness in one person, while another person may develop a life-threatening illness. The exact mechanisms for these variations have yet to be elucidated, but interplay between the viral virulence factors, host immune response, and viral immune evasion strategies are likely involved. Viral infections may precede secondary infection by other pathogens, precipitate asthma exacerbations, cause severe disease in the lower respiratory tract, and even induce autoimmunity [1] . It is also important to acknowledge that uncomplicated common cold symptoms including sneezing, coughing, hypersecretion resulting in runny nose and local inflammation itself may be interpreted as a complex host defense mechanism with the goal to eliminate the pathogen.",

Increased incidence of colds during the cold winter months, and in those exposed to extreme cold weather gives us some insight into this defense mechanism [2] . A factor that contributes to the seasonality pattern of common cold may be cooling of the nasal mucosal epithelium, which inhibits mucociliary clearance as well as leukocyte phagocytic activity. On the other hand inhalation of warm vapor may alleviate nasal congestion associated with a cold. Nasal resistance as measured by a rhinomanometer increases with reducing room temperature [3] , and that increase is more pronounced in summer than in winter. The latter may be due to cold adaptation of the nasal mucosa in winter.",

In addition, the number of ciliated nasal epithelial cells decreases, their regeneration slows down, and their beating frequency and intracellular synchrony are changed.

Thus, mucosal epithelia represent an important surface barrier for agents causing respiratory diseases like common cold. The mucosa is protected by numerous effectors of the innate immune system that closely work together with those of the adaptive immune system. Induction of mucosal immune responses occurs in the respiratory tract in Waldeyer's ring, which includes nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue like adenoids and the tonsils, although the major part of organized mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) is located in the gut (gut-associated lymphoid tissue, GALT, e.g., aggregated Peyer's patches and isolated B-cell follicles). At least 80% of all immunoglobulin (Ig)-producing plasma cells and blasts are located in intestinal lamina propria. Approximately 90% of terminally differentiated B cells produce dimers or large polymers of IgA, which are transported externally as secretory IgA (SIgA) by an epithelial component (membrane secretory component, SC) [9] . The bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) is thought to represent a major site in which IgA isotype switch and differentiation of B cells occur [10] . Since this is not a constitutive feature of normal human lung, other parts of the human respiratory tract like the airway epithelium are believed to fulfill supporter functions, e.g., by constitutively producing interleukin (IL)-5, a cytokine with functions for the growth and differentiation of IgA-producing plasma cells [10] .",

            "text": "Common cold is of particular importance for infants. Therefore, when discussing local or mucosal immunology of common cold, it is necessary to briefly review the role of breastfeeding. The interaction between the innate and the adaptive immune system is a prerequisite for the successful defense against respiratory pathogens. This cooperation is of particular interest for newborns because of the immediate exposure to a broad variety of microorganisms after birth. In this context, breast feeding is important for two main reasons, (i) the transfer of antibodies, and (ii) the provision of immunemodulating properties. Lactating mammary glands reflect the status of the integrated mucosal immune system of the mother [9, 16] in both gut and airways. Secretory antibodies are targeted against infectious agents in the mother's environment (which are likely to be encountered by the infant during its first weeks of life). SIgA from breast milk has been shown to exhibit specificity to a variety of common intestinal and respiratory pathogens [9, 16] . Interestingly, the protection is not only demonstrable in populations living in poor sanitary conditions. The beneficial effect has also been demonstrated in developed countries [17] . In a recent analysis of approximately 400 observational studies, it was shown that a history of breastfeeding was associated with a reduction in the risk of acute otitis media, nonspecific gastroenteritis, severe lower respiratory tract infections, atopic dermatitis and asthma in young children [18] . In addition to the antibodies in the milk, numerous other factors are thought to protect the breastfed newborn. These are innate defense factors including lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidase, and complex oligosaccharides that may serve as receptor analogues as well as fatty acids and mucins. In addition, colostral leukocytes (~4 10 6 /ml) play an important role in the protection of the suckling newborn. Macrophages constitute 55-60%, neutrophilic granulocytes 30-40% and lymphocytes (mainly T cells) 5-10% of the cells in colostrums [9, 16, 17] . ",

Therefore, the pathogenesis of rhinovirus-induced disease is more likely due to inflammatory responses of the host, than to direct effect of the virus [34] . Although the link between the host's immune response to the clinical symptoms might be generally true for a variety of respiratory tract pathogens, it is safe to say that differences with respect to the interactions of individual pathogens with the host's immune system exist, resulting in a variety of clinical manifestations. For example, rhinoviruses are seen as typical pathogens causing common cold [34] , RSV is known to cause common cold, but RSV is also a major producer of bronchiolitis, pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infection [35] . Adenoviruses may play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [36] and a respiratory coronavirus, the SARS-coronavirus is able to cause a severe acute respiratory syndrome resulting in high mortality [37, 38] .",
