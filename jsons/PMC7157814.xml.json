In\nSierra Leone, local physicians treated approximately 100 Ebola patients with a combination\nof the two drugs. They noted \u201cremarkable improvement\u201d in survival.

Both statins and ARBs target the host response to\ninfection, not the virus (9). They act largely\n(although not exclusively) on endothelial dysfunction, which is a common feature of many\nvirus infections (17). Both drugs counter endothelial\ndysfunction by affecting the ACE2/angiotensin-(1\u20137)/Mas and angiopoietin/Tie-2\nsignaling axes (9).
