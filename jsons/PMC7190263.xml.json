Approximately 40% to 60% of SSIs are preventable.7 Correctly administered perioperative prophylactic antibiotics decrease the rate of SSIs.1,2 Clinical practice guidelines for antimicrobial prophylaxis published in the American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy recommend intraoperative antibiotic dosing intervals during surgical procedures based on the pharmacokinetics of each drug.2,8 In the cardiac surgical patient population, correct intraoperative antibiotic redosing has decreased SSI rates.3",

In May 2015, we gathered baseline data. Concurrently, monthly meetings were held with the SSI workgroup to review current processes. The SSI workgroup consisted of a surgeon from each subspecialty, a pharmacist from the Antimicrobial Stewardship Program, members from the Performance Improvement Department, an IT specialist, OR nursing managers, and 2 anesthesiologists. At these meetings, research into existing intraoperative antibiotic redosing guidelines and policies took place. Most committee members, including the anesthesiologists, surgeons, and OR nurses, were unaware of formal antibiotic redosing guidelines. However, we discovered that hospital guidelines did exist via a paper ordering sheet. In June 2015, members of the project team worked with members of the hospital\u2019s Antimicrobial Stewardship Program to establish perioperative antimicrobial guidelines utilizing information from the Infectious Disease Society of America and information compiled from hospitals that are part of the Children\u2019s Hospital Association Network (Table 3).8,11,12 This work outlined procedures and drug-specific timeframes for intraoperative antibiotic redosing. To be deemed compliant with the redosing, antibiotics needed to be administered 30 minutes before or after the electronic medical record (EMR) redosing due time, determined by the antibiotic administration start time. If a procedure was longer than 2 half-lives, the drug was to be readministered. Renal function did not play a specific role in the creation of the guidelines; however, the pharmacy looks at the creatinine clearance if available on each patient before fulfilling a requested redose.",

If a case required more than 1 redose, all required redoses needed to be administered correctly, or the case was considered noncompliant. As stated, most physicians were unaware of these guidelines. In June 2015, we assessed surgeon and anesthesia provider knowledge using a survey. Of the 48 who received the survey, 20 responded for a response rate of 41.7%. Only 41% of responders felt that they had a clear understanding of the redosing guidelines. The lack of clarity is evident by the average 2014 compliance rate of 11.2% (Fig. 1).",

The project team created laminated cards with the new guidelines and posted them at every anesthesia workstation. Education on the new guidelines, the time frame considered compliant for redosing, and the new EMR alert was provided at department meetings in August 2015 and sent via email to all anesthesiologists and surgeons. The process for ordering the antibiotics consisted of the OR circulating nurse calling the pharmacy to request a redose. All education was provided before the project go-live date of August 10, 2015.

            "text": "Following the project initiation, monthly evaluation of EMR data occurred. The Performance Improvement Department conducted an initial data review with potential cases of noncompliance sent to the anesthesiologists on the project team. The review of these noncompliant cases involved peer-to-peer conversations and revisions in the process followed by further education if required (Table 2). Anesthesiologists often notated in the record as to why the antibiotic redose was late or missed. This notation was crucial as sometimes the peer-to-peer conversations would take place 3 weeks after surgery, making recall difficult. By analyzing noncompliance, we identified oversights in the process, recurring issues with providers, and issues at specific locations or times of day (Table 2). Anesthesia providers received monthly updates on compliance rates. In October 2015, the anesthesia resident involved in a missed antibiotic redose was unaware of the hospital\u2019s new guidelines and thought the EMR alert was incorrect and therefore ignored it. Education sessions or emails about the process and guidelines excluded anesthesia residents as identified by the missed antibiotic dose. Anesthesia residents rotate through the ORs monthly and play an important role in direct patient care. To address this oversight, we included the Perioperative Antimicrobial Guidelines and education on the EMR alerts in the resident orientation. This oversight also highlighted the problem that redosing was strictly reliant on the anesthesia team. Therefore, the time-out process was updated to include a discussion on antibiotic redosing. The circulating nurse writes the redosing time on the surgical whiteboard for all members of the OR team to see, adding a layer of protection in the process. In November 2015, a provider recognized that the new guidelines did not address redosing in neonates. Team leaders discussed this with the team pharmacist, who created separate neonatal guidelines for those less than 28 days of age with normal renal function. In November 2016, during data analysis and with input from anesthesiologists, it was determined that misses or near misses were occurring off hours (after 5 pm and on the weekends) and in non-OR locations (such as the fetal care center). To account for this, we updated the EMR antibiotic reminder to alert 30 minutes before the time due, allowing staff more time to order and physically receive the antibiotics. Project leaders discussed these obstacles at group meetings and encouraged anesthesia providers to order the antibiotics early in these circumstances. The pharmacy representative on the team was also made aware of this problem to provide education to the pharmacy staff. Providers received updates when new PDCA cycles or updates in the process occurred.",

Our compliance rates increased the first month significantly (Fig. 1) and have remained high for over 41 months, averaging 99.2%. We believe that our compliance rates rose so significantly because our institution\u2019s previous guidelines were unclear and that our compliance rates are higher than those reported by other institutions because of the multilayered approach of our study.

Upon initial development of the reordering process, the project team wanted the EMR to alert the OR pharmacy when an antibiotic redose was near due; however, limitations in the EMR made this impossible, and we were unable to identify an alternative solution for pharmacy involvement in the reordering process. Per hospital policy, physicians order all antibiotics from the pharmacy to ensure administration of the correct dose, which can take additional time. And, as with any QI project, communication is imperative. Some providers remained unaware of the changes implemented with this project. The education initially excluded residents and new providers, as we identified with monthly audits. An additional limitation is that OR nurses do not always write the antibiotic redosing time on the whiteboard despite this being part of the time-out process. We have not initiated any PDCA cycles to improve this, but it is something we could consider in the future. Finally, we did not have a control group without intervention because the project included all cases meeting requirements for redosing by nature of the QI initiative.",
