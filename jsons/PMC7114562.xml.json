In 1971, PEDV was reported in the UK for the first time (Wood, 1977).

Since 2010, large-scale outbreaks of PED caused by PEDV variant strains have been emerged in China and other Asian countries (Sun et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012).",

The whole genome of PEDV is 28,033 nt, with a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), at least 7 open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 through 6), and a 3'UTR (Kocherhans et al., 2001). ORF1a and 1b encode non-structural proteins (nsps), ORF3 encodes one nonstructural accessory protein (ORF3, 27 kDa) and the remaining ORFs code for four major structural proteins including the spike protein (S,180\u2212220 kDa), the envelope protein (E,7 kDa), the membrane protein (M,27\u221232 kDa), and the nucleocapsid protein (N,55\u221258 kDa) from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 (Song and Park, 2012; Duarte et al., 1993; Huang et al., 2013; Kocherhans et al., 2001). Previous studies showed that the N-protein of coronavirus was highly phosphorylated and formed the helical ribonuclear protein (RNP) that composed the viral core intertwining with the viral genome RNA (Wang and Zhang, 1999; Macneughton and Davies, 1978). The PEDV N-protein was also shown to be associated with viral nucleolar localization, cell survival, upregulation of IL-8 production, and inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 expression (Xu et al., 2013; Olson et al., 2000; Shi et al., 2014, 2017).",

            "text": "The N-protein of coronavirus is a highly conserved structural protein and the predominant antigen produced in coronavirus infected cells (Sturman and Holmes, 1983). The N protein of SARS CoV is abundantly released in the patients\u2019 blood in the course of early infection, suggesting that the N protein is a suitable candidate for diagnostic applications (Zhang et al., 2011). N protein also can be used as the target for the accurate and early diagnosis of PEDV infection (Song and Park, 2012). N-protein epitopes play an important role in cellular immunity induction (Saif, 1993), thus can be used for the development of PED vaccines. However, there are only few studies on the PEDV N-protein epitopes, focusing on N1-10 (18\u2013133) and N2-10 (252\u2013262) (Wang et al., 2016). In a recent study, Lin and C.M et al., found cross-reaction based N-protein epitope in the antisera of PEDV and TGEV. They concluded that more crossover epitopes may be present in the N-protein (Lin et al., 2015). Ma et al., demonstrated two-way cross reactivity between PEDV and porcine Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in the conserved epitope (s) of N-protein (Ma et al., 2016). Therefore it is of great significance to establish a rapid and accurate diagnosis method to study and analyze the antigenicity of the PEDV N-protein.",

Based on the gene sequence of PEDV strain CV777, the primers of N truncated protein were designed using Primer 5.0 software. The upstream and downstream primers of the gene were inserted with BamHI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively (Table 1\n). All fragments were amplified by RT-PCR using cDNA of PEDV CV777 as a template. The PCR products of N truncated gene were cloned into a pET-32a (m) vector, a reconstructed plasmid with a MsyB label, replacing the TrxA label using XbaI and MscI restriction enzyme sites. The recombinant plasmid were transformed into the E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3). The proteins were induced by 1 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG).

The results demonstrated that McAb 1C9 reacted with polypeptide II (complete NEP-1C9 of CV777) but not with polypeptide I, III (partial NEP-1C9) and IV (complete NEP-1C9 of variant strains). The sera from mice inoculated with inactived PEDV SH had no reactivity with all of the four peptides. The OD450 of the YZ-sera reacted with peptide IV was higher than that with peptides I, II and III (Fig. 7\n), indicating that the integrity of NEP-1C9 was associated with its specificity and that the first amino acid residue His398 or Nsp398 was an important amino acid.",

The prevalence of Chinese variant strains has resulted in tremendous economic losses to the pig industry (Jung and Saif, 2015). The development of PEDV antibody-based assays is important for detecting infected pigs, confirming previous virus exposure, and monitoring sow herd immunity. However, the potential cross reactivity among porcine coronaviruses is a major concern for the development of pathogen-specific assays. Identification of viral antigenic epitopes and analysis of their conservation can deepen our understanding of antigen structure and virus-antibody interactions, help in establishment of rapid and effective clinical diagnostic methods and development of effective vaccine (Song and Park, 2012; Zhang et al., 2012).",

The S1 subunit participates in receptor recognition and is an important determinant of PEDV virulence (Suzuki et al., 2018), while S2 mediates virus-cell membrane fusion during entry. The S-protein contains multiple neutralizing epitopes and has been utilized for PEDV vaccine development and diagnostic reagents (Suzuki et al., 2018; Chang et al., 2002; Cruz et al., 2008; Li et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2008). An S-protein based ELISA was established and proved better than an N-protein based ELISA (Knuchel et al., 1992). However, the S-protein has great variability (Sun et al., 2008; Hain et al., 2016; Oh et al., 2014). Further, the neutralizing McAb of the protein could not inactivate PEDV strain with other genotype (Liu et al., 2017). The high heterogeneity of the S1 protein among PEDV isolates within and between genogroups limits the sensitivity of S-protein-based assays in the field (Lin et al., 2015).",

            "text": "The N-protein of PEDV, the most abundant viral protein expressed in the infected cells, is highly conserved among PEDV genogroups (96\u201399.7 % amino acid identity). Compared to other porcine coronaviruses, the amino acid similarity of the PEDV N-protein is lower than 35 %. PEDV N-protein can be detected early in the virus infection and is an ideal antigen for serological diagnosis (Lee and Yeo, 2003). However, the epitopes of N-protein are highly conserved among the family Coronaviridae and cross-epitopes with certain TGEV strains have been reported (Lin et al., 2015). The study of the N-protein specific epitopes is conducive to development of correct and rapid clinical diagnostic methods to distinguish from TGEV and effective vaccination, but currently there are few studies on epitope of N-protein. To our knowledge, only the epitopes N1-10 (18-133aa) and N2-10 (252-262aa) in the N-protein have been reported (Wang et al., 2016; Lee and Yeo, 2003). Shi et al. found that the 148-294aa of PEDV N-protein interactded with nucleolar phosphoprotein (NPM1) (Shi et al., 2017). In this study, using purified PEDV as antigen, five McAbs recognizing PEDV were screened through hybridoma technology. To confirm the specificity of the monoclonal antibody, the N, M, S1 and S2 protein expressed in prokaryotic cells were also used as coating antigen of ELISA. The results shown that these monoclonal antibody could not recognize M and S protein and three recognized N protein. To further confirm the specificity of the monoclonal antibody, N protein expressed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells were used as antigen in western blot. The results shown that two of the McAbs, 3H8 and 3H10, reacted with N-protein expressed by baculovirus expression system, but did not bind to N-protein expressed in the prokaryotic expression system. And the other three McAbs, 3F10, 1C9, and 6A11, recognized N-protein expressed in both baculovirus expression system and in the prokaryotic expression system. The results indicated that 3H8 and 3H10 specifically recognized the conformational epitope instead of the linearized epitope. 3F10, 1C9, and 6A11 recognized the linearized epitopes. Using iELISA and western blot, three epitopes, 56QIRWRMRRGERI67, 398HEEAIYDDV406 and 318GYAQIASLAPNVAALLFGGNVAVRE342 were recognized by the McAb 3F10, 1C9, and 6A11, respectively. NEP-3F10 was included in N1-10, consistent with previous reports (Wang et al., 2016). The two novel epitopes, NEP-1C9, and NEP-6A11 were firstly identified.",

The results demonstrated that the OD450 of the YZ-sera reacted with peptide IV was the highest compared with polypeptide I, II and III.

The Vero cells inoculated with CV777 could reacted with the five McAb and positive serum, and showed obvious green fluorescence on the surface.
