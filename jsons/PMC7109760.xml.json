            "text": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated from a patient in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in June 2012. Most of the approximately 1700 incident cases to date have been managed in the Middle East. However, this disease has been exported to 27 countries in North America, Asia, Europe and Africa. The majority of these were solitary cases that did not cause secondary spread. In June 2015, Korea experienced the largest outbreak outside of Saudi Arabia with an extended chain of transmission involving multiple generations of cases, including 186 patients and 36 deaths (20%).1 This demonstrated the potential of MERS-CoV in widespread human-to-human transmission, leading to disruption of health and socio-economic systems.",

            "text": "Anti-coronavirus therapy is challenging to develop. Coronaviruses are biologically diverse and rapidly mutating. Hence, effective agents for one strain, especially those that target replicative mechanisms, may be useless in another strain. Animal studies are logistically and technically difficult as the number of animal models available is limited and only found in designated biosafety level 3 laboratories.2 These challenges result in what we identify as a lack of novel and effective treatment modalities and the paucity of clinical trials. Most of the current treatment options for MERS are extrapolated from the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak. A heterogeneous range of treatments is used in MERS patients. For example, in a recent audit3 involving 51 patients in Saudi Arabia, 42 (82.4%) received broad-spectrum antibiotics; 5 (9.8%) received hydrocortisone; and 31 (61%) received antiviral treatments. The antiviral treatments included: interferon-\u03b2 in 23 (45.1%), interferon-\u03b1 in 8 (15.7%), and mycophenolate mofetil in 8 (15.7%).",

            "text": "There are fundamental differences between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that put in question the basis of applying the evidence from treatment of the former to the latter. Although MERS-CoV is phylogenetically related to the SARS-CoV, there are differences in their biological make-up, pathogenesis and clinical manifestations. In contrast to SARS-CoV, which binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors, MERS-CoV binds to the receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4/CD26).4,5 MERS-CoV in vivo targets a wide variety of cells, including type II alveolar cells, non-ciliated epithelial cells (Clara cells) and endothelial cells, but not ACE-2-expressing ciliated epithelial cells infected by SARS-CoV.6 MERS-CoV, unlike SARS-CoV, can also infect and replicate in human monocyte-derived macrophages.7 This increases the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I and co-stimulatory molecules leading to a more exaggerated activation of the immune response, including the expression of interleukin-12, interferon-\u03b3 and chemokines. These differences in receptor usage and susceptibility to type I and type III interferon may account for the differences in disease patterns, organ tropism and virus shedding.6,8\u201310",

A systematic review and meta-analysis by the University of Nottingham, which included 32 studies of SARS-CoV infection and severe influenza, concluded that there was a statistically significant reduction in mortality when convalescent plasma was administered early, compared with placebo or no therapy.51 However, the studies were deemed to be low quality and heterogeneous. They lacked control groups and the effects of convalescent plasma or IVIG could not be discerned from the effects of patient comorbidities, stage of illness or other treatments.",

The use of IFN-\u03b12a and ribavirin was described in four case reports76\u201379 and five retrospective cohort studies.80\u201384 These studies involved mainly critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation.

One of these studies investigated the impact of earlier administration of IFN and ribavirin.82 This study involved 44 mechanically ventilated patients. Twenty-two were given IFN-\u03b12a and ribavirin and the median time to therapy administration was 3 days.

There are retrospective and non-randomized interventional data obtained during the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks showing that convalescent plasma brought about a rapid decrease in viraemia and reduced mortality.18,43\u201351 Treatment with convalescent plasma is likely to be more effective when there is significant viraemia, hence early administration is key.51,52 A prospective human study investigating the use of convalescent plasma in MERS is ongoing, but is facing logistical and recruitment challenges. Plasma products and immunoglobulins vary geographically and will likewise vary in efficacy against MERS.55\u201357 Given the small number of MERS patients and the significant mortality of this infection, there may not be sufficient convalescent sera for this to be a scalable option, particularly outside of the Middle East. Cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV antibodies has been observed but is unlikely to be useful therapeutically.22 mAbs could offer a useful alternative as they are rapidly reproducible and have so far shown high potency and specificity. However, further development is likely to be tempered by the challenges of licensing and full-scale production at affordable costs for an undefined population.",
