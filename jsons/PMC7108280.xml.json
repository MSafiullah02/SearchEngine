Clearly, the spread of these diseases can continue to compromise mission capability and security.",

As shown in Fig. 1\n, the FRI incidence differed significantly over time. There were 2 distinctive surges of FRI that coincided with the peaks for influenza A virus in the months of June 2006 and January-February 2007. We observed a predominance of H3N2 subtypes at 38.0% (124/326) of all influenza A virus infections, and less H1N1 at 15.6% (51/326) (data not shown). The remaining influenza A-positive samples remained negative from the PCR-subtyping assays, suggesting that these specimens were of relatively low viral load. The pattern for influenza B virus incidence was sporadic throughout the surveillance period (Fig. 1). In May 2006, the incidence of influenza B virus superseded that of influenza A virus, resulting in a noticeable peak (Fig. 1). We speculate that this could represent a small outbreak among the recruits within the same training group, or sharing the same sleeping dormitories.",

Throughout the current one-year study, the laboratory findings identified influenza A and B viruses in 36% (485/1354) of the FRI cases, with H3N2 as the predominant annual subtype in Singapore. Two peaks were observed, in June 2006 where the proportion of influenza detected rose above 80%, and January-February 2007 (Fig. 1). This bimodal pattern and the predominant H3N2 subtype concurred with reports at the national level from the Singapore Ministry of Health.25, 26, 27 On the other hand, the sporadic pattern for influenza B virus incidence is in contrast with the cluster of infections reported nationally at the beginning of 2006 and 2007.25, 26 The laboratory-confirmed data suggests that the outbreaks in the military were related to the national outbreaks due to the interactions by the military personnel and the community. In addition, the influenza A cases in our study had significantly more symptoms of cough than other FRI cases (Table 2). The participants in Camp X were new recruits who were exposed to military activities for the first time, and we expected them to demonstrate increased vulnerability to respiratory infections. In the US military, it was reported that new recruits were 29 times more likely to be hospitalized for respiratory infections than other military personnel.2, 3, 4 The laboratory-confirmed incidence of H-AdV infections remained low throughout the study period, at 0.4% (5/1364). This is in contrast to more than 50% reported in South Korean and the US military recruits.9, 14, 16 No respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in the Singapore cohort.28 Instead 9 cases of HMPV (Table 1) were detected and majority were of the A2 genotype, reported to be associated with an increased severity in respiratory infections.29, 30\n",
