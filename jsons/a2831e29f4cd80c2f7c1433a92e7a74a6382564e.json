From a cost-benefit perspective, the largely remedial, as opposed to practice, interventions the social service system has chosen are extremely costly and highly unproductive for both client and practitioner in terms of targets, timing of intervention, ages, and contexts. Social, cognitive, and academic skills that individuals must master should provide the focus for intervention from a life-span development perspective. A review and analysis centering on social problems underscores the need for cost-effective, evidence-based, and preventive efforts. First, the personal and societal costs of child abuse, educational outcomes, violence in the schools, teenage sexuality, HIV/AIDS, drug abuse, crime, urban decline and homelessness, unemployment, marital conflict, race, retirement, and hospice are analyzed. Subsequent chapters review the personal, social, economic, and political benefits of prevention. Preventive models of service delivery are elucidated. The chapter concludes with specific applications and discussions.",

Practitioners do not take a passive role in the intervention process, but instead attempt to help clients learn how to exert control over their own behaviors and over the environments in which they live. Professional knowledge, expertise, and understanding of human behavior theory and personality development are used by the practitioner in the conceptualization and implementation of intervention strategies. Since their training equips them to evaluate scientifically any prevention procedure they have instituted, there is continual assessment of the prevention process.",

One informative example of this unfortunate policy is the curtailing of family planning services and teen pregnancy programs. Specifically, savings in public medical costs alone are estimated to be $5.68 for each $1 spent in contraceptive services to the typical clinic patient (Frost, Zolna, & Frohwirth, 2013) . Savings in income support and social services are greater yet. Approximately 13.9% women of reproductive age have no insurance (Guttmacher Institute, 2015) . State insurance commissioners should pressure planning services. Teens, single women, and poor women, who have the highest incidence of low-birth-weight (LBW) babies, are most likely to use publicly funded family services (Guttmacher Institute, 2016a) and these women tend to have far more unwanted pregnancies (Guttmacher Institute, 2016b).",

This proved to be a gross underestimation of the true extent of the problem. Since the 1960s, the number of reported victims of all types of maltreatment has steadily increased. By 1984, 1.7 million children were reported as victims, 2.4 million were reported in 1989, and 2.9 million were reported in 1993 (Ards & Harrel, 1993; Curtis, Boyd, Liepold, & Petit, 1995; McCurdy & Daro, 1993; National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN), 1988; NCCAN, 1995) . Allowing for duplicated counts, an estimated 2.3 million individual children were subjects of report in 1993 (NCCAN, 1995) . Of these, just over 1000 were fatalities related to child maltreatment (NCCAN, 1995) . Curtis and his colleagues have estimated, based on several national reports, that approximately 18,000 serious disabilities and 141,000 serious injuries arise annually from maltreatment (Curtis et al., 1995) . In 1993, about 24% of victims suffered from physical abuse and about 48% from neglect (NCCAN, 1995) . The most recent national statistics estimated 1670 children die of abuse or neglect at a rate of 2.25 per 100,000 children (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (U.S. DHHS), 2017). In relation to age groups of those reported as maltreated, the youngest group, aged birth to 1 year, is more likely than any other age group to be subjected to maltreatment, composing 24.2% of the victims (U.S. DHHS, 2017) . Children from families with low socioeconomic status were five times more likely to experience child maltreatment than children from families with higher incomes (Sedlak et al., 2010) ; children in a single parent home have over a 70% chance of being victimized than children with both parents in the home. Other risk factors have been identified as well.",

Violent crimes rarely occur in schools (Hahn et al., 2007) . However, the Department of Health and Human Services (2008) identifies youth violence as a significant public health problem. Despite the hint that violent crimes are more prevalent in communities as opposed to school houses, which have been beefed-up with armed, resource officers, the National Center for Education Statistics (2016) indicates that in the 2013-2014 academic year 65% of public schools reported one or more serious violent incidents. In 2014, among students ages 12-18, there were about 850,100 nonfatal victimizations at school, which included 363,700 theft victimizations and 486,400 violent victimizations (Morgan, Musu-Gillette, Robers, & Zhang, 2015) . Furthermore, research indicates that 740,000 violent crimes were committed against children at school in 2003 (Hahn et al., 2007) .

In 1985, for example, teenage pregnancy cost each US taxpayer $16.65 in Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Medicaid, and food stamps (Guttmacher Institute, 1985) . In another example, the city of Baltimore spent about $179,500,000 in 1987 on AFDC, Medicaid, and food stamps for families that were begun when the mother was a teenager. Had these births been delayed until the mother was at least 20 years old, Baltimore would have saved almost $72,000,000 in public outlays (Santelli, Rosenblatt, & Birn, 1990) . The cost borne by Medicaid for a birth to a teenager age 14 or younger has been calculated as $3494; the cost for 15-17 year olds is $3224; and for 18-19 year olds, it is $2696, exclusive of pediatric care (Armstrong & Waszak, 1990) . While the prevalence of teenage pregnancy has steadily declined since the late 1980s, the cost of this social problem to taxpayers continues to be of major concern. In 2010, taxpayers spent a total of $10.9 billion on costs related to teenage pregnancy, birth, and teenage motherhood. Each child born to a teenage mother today costs US taxpayers $1682 (The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, 2011).",

In addition, adolescents are the fastest growing segment of the population newly diagnosed with HIV in the USA. Many adolescents may acquire the infection and are not diagnosed until later. The latency period for the HIV infection can be as long as 10 years (CDC, 2010a (CDC, , 2010b . In 2008, the CDC estimated that of the 68,600 adolescents living with HIV, nearly 60% were unaware they were infected (CDC, 2012) . Within the adolescent population in the USA, males tend to acquire the virus more often than females. White men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for 61% of the new HIV diagnoses in 2009 (CDC, 2011). While gay and bisexual men continue to be the most affected population, the trend toward more transmissions occurring through heterosexual activity and intravenous drug use has occurred for several decades. Females most often acquire the disease through heterosexual activity (71%). Most startlingly in the USA, the disproportionately large number of HIV/AIDS infections found in African Americans. In 2009, this race accounted for more than 44% of new HIV/AIDS cases. Minority races, women, and children are becoming more and more represented in those with the virus. Considering geographic data within the USA, urban areas contain large proportion of HIV infections; however, rural area infection rates are increasing.

The reported overall cost of drug abuse exacts more than $740 billion annually (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2017). This is a 5.34% annual increase. A breakdown looks like this: health care costs comprising treatment, prevention programs, and medical consequences (HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B and C, and drug-exposed infant) total more than $15.8 billion; productivity losses (premature death, abuse related illness, institutionalization, etc.) more than $128.6 billion; and costs of other effects which addresses the criminal costs (police protection, supply reduction measures, and state and federal corrections) comprised an additional $36.4 billion (Lewin Group, 2004, pp. ix-xi) . However, careful scrutiny of these figures suggests gross exaggeration, e.g., they include private legal defense, abuse related figures in both the health care  table and the productivity table; incarceration is listed in the productivity table and  in the other effects table; and there is a category listed as crime careers accounting for more than $27 billion that appears to be a mystery.

The number of the homeless is a matter of dispute between governments and advocates for the homeless due to inconsistent definitions, methodologies, and samples studied (Kondratas, 1991; Mihaly, 1991; Morrison, 1989; Newman, 2001; Tsemberis, McHugo, Williams, Hanrahan, & Stefancic, 2007) . The number may not be in the millions, as estimated by homeless advocates, but most parties agree that it is as least in the hundreds of thousands, even without counting the rising number of families living doubled up with friends or relatives (Dyrness, Spoto, & Thompson, 2003) . Other homeless families can be found living in cars and abandoned buildings (Fertig & Reingold, 2008) . Moreover, all data indicate that poor families, headed up mostly minority, young, single mothers with children, people with mental health and substance use problem, occupy an increasing share of the rank and file of the homeless (Brown et al., 2016; Eisenberg & Keil, 2000; Rossi, 1994) . A major cause of homelessness is poverty. Families make up approximately one-third of all homeless and are the fastest-growing group of homeless (Rosenheck, Bassuk, & Solomon, 2001) . Children are estimated to make up between one-third and one half of the members of homeless families (Mihaly, 1991) . Most studies of the homeless indicate that the number of homeless families and extremely poor families with children who are precariously housed and thus at risk of homelessness is also increasing.",

In July 2012, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that 12.8 million people were unemployed. In the 1980s and 1990s, it has also become increasingly difficult for young people to negotiate the transition from school to work (Mann, Miller, & Baum, 1995; Sum, Fogg, & Taggert, 1988) . This is particularly true for young people with little education or training, but even those with college degrees find job acquisition more challenging (Sum et al., 1988) .

Needless to say, any such estimate runs into billions of dollars quickly. One recent study found that counties with higher unemployment rates had higher rates of depression hospitalizations as unemployment appeared to be risk factor for hospitalization. These high cost hospitalizations add to the overall social costs for the unemployed (Fortney et al., 2007) . A 1% rise in unemployment, for example, has been estimated to add $55 billion to the federal deficit. Given the range of health, social, and psychological problems associated with unemployment, such dollar estimates fall short of representing the full impact of unemployment on individuals, their families, and the larger community.",

Lower marital quality has been linked to high levels of depression and a lower quality of life (Amato, 2014; Choi & Marks, 2008) . Bray and Jouriles (1995) discussed the cost-effectiveness of marital therapy and noted that the majority of marital therapies that have been empirically evaluated are relatively brief in duration and below the standard 20-session limit imposed by health insurance companies. Using an average cost of $60 to $100 per session, an average course of marital therapy would cost between $600 and $1000. As stated by Bray and Jouriles, \"Even twice this amount seems certainly less than the cost of a divorce and pales in comparison to the costs of many medical procedures\" (1995, p. 469 ).",
