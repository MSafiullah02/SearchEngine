CPPs are a family of peptides that are structurally diverse but share the ability to translocate a wide range of different bioactive molecules into living cells [1]. The list of available CPPs has grown rapidly and CPPs have been employed for a variety of applications. CPPs serving as vectors can successfully facilitate the intracellular transport of cargoes, such as small-molecule therapeutic agents [2], proteins, quantum dots [3], and MRI contrast agents [4], both in vitro and in vivo [5]. In addition, this efficient transport system has lower cytotoxicity in a variety of cell lines compared with other delivery methods [6].",

            "text": "The mechanism of the internalization of CPPs and their cargo is not well understood and has recently been the subject of controversy. CPPs can interact with multiple cell surface molecules, including membrane lipids and membrane-associated proteoglycans [7]. CPPs can be taken up by cells via multiple pathways, such as direct translocation through the membrane bilayer or endocytosis-mediated uptake. Although molecules entering cells prefer the direct membrane translocation pathway, endocytosis, composed of two steps, endocytotic entry and endosomal escape, is the major cellular uptake pathway for most CPPs as most reports have pointed out [8]. Endocytosis occurs by various formats, which can be classified into caveolae and/or lipid raft-mediated endocytosis [9], micropinocytosis [10], through clathrin-mediated endocytosis [11] or via a cholesterol-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis [12]. The endocytosis pathway is proposed based on the fact that CPP uptake in cells was found to adopt an energy-dependent mechanism [13]. However, cellular uptake is not completely prohibited at low temperatures or in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors [13], suggesting a non-energy consuming route. Recently, the finding of strong peptide\u2013lipid interactions supports direct translocation of the peptides across the membrane [14]. In addition, many studies also propose cellular uptake can follow multiple routes depending on experimental conditions, specific CPP sequence, and the cargo structure [15].",

Antimicrobial peptides, a major class of antibacterial agents, share amphiphilicity and cationic structural properties with cell-penetrating peptides. All AMPs known by the late-1990s are cationic. However, the concept that AMPs need to be cationic was changed later with the discovery of negatively charged AMPs in 1997 [16]. For example, maximin-H5 [17] discovered from frog skin and dermicidin [18] secreted from human sweat gland tissues are both anionic peptides. They also have a positive net charge, normally in the range of +4 to +6, which is due to the frequent presence of lysines and arginines in the amino acid sequence [19]. Additionally, nearly 50 % of their structure often consists of hydrophobic residues. They kill a broad spectrum of microbes including bacteria and fungi by destroying their cell membranes and are important components of the innate immune system of many animals and plants [20].",

CPPs and AMPs are similar in the structural motif of amino acid composition, but differ in biological activities within the lipid membrane. Common to both groups are interactions of cell membrane components with the charged amino acid residues of the peptides. This is probably the first step in cell association that leads to cellular uptake. Anionic phospholipids or phosphate groups of lipopolysaccharides (for gram-negative bacteria) or acidic polysaccharides, teichoic acids, and lipoteichoic acids (for gram-positive bacteria) are the membrane components at the cell surface responsible for generating an overall negative net charge, making the binding of positively charged or amphipathic peptides possible [21]. Furthermore, the lipid bilayer of bacterial membrane contains mainly lipids with negatively charged phospholipid headgroups, while fungi, in contrast, exhibit a zwitterionic lipid bilayer composition, upon which the uptake is driven by hydrophobic N- or C-terminus or particular amino acids of the peptide sequence, resulting in the accumulation of the peptide, which finally induces strong hydrophobic interaction to the membrane.",

            "text": "Charge interactions between cationic residues and lipids are essential to the biological function of many membrane peptides and proteins, for example, cellular translocation of CPPs, and membrane disruption of AMPs. The ratio between the cationic lysine (Lys) and arginine (Arg) residues influences membrane selectivity since the guanidino functionalities of arginines promote a more efficient interaction with eukaryotic membranes as compared to lysine. This is, however, most often at the expense of increased cytotoxicity. A high Lys content has been correlated with selectivity toward bacterial cells over eukaryotic cells [22]. Furthermore, the ability of CPPs to permeate cell membranes appears to be directly linked to their propensity to fold into a well-defined secondary structure (\u03b1-helix or \u03b2-sheet) while interacting with biological membranes [23]. Likewise, the antimicrobial activity of \u03b1-helical AMPs depends on their propensity to form an \u03b1-helix [24]. The highly basic Arg guanidinium and Lys ammonium groups remain protonated under physiological pH conditions and thus can function as hydrogen bond (H-bond) donors in various protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013lipid interactions. In lipid membranes, the guanidinium group in protein side chain can form a branched moiety by interacting with water and lipid molecules. In the past few years, many CPPs and AMPs have been extensively investigated to elucidate the structural basis of how these cationic macromolecules interact with membrane lipids and water [25].",

PG-1 is representative of many \u03b2-sheet AMPs in its disulfide-linked structure and has an Arg-rich sequence. HNP-1 belongs to the \u03b1-defensin family of antimicrobial peptides and is the mediator of the host innate immune response. Most AMPs adopt rigid amphipathic secondary structures, either \u03b1-helical or \u03b2-sheet [28]. The two CPPs, TAT and penetratin, are the first two discovered and also most frequently applied CPPs [25]. They display a turn-rich conformation and random coil structure in lipid bilayers, respectively, suggesting that the absence of intra- or intermolecular H-bonded conformation and high molecular mobility may be the hallmarks of CPPs which differentiates them from AMPs. Due to the similar Arg-rich structural motif, CPPs and AMPs have strong Arg-lipid and Arg-water interactions, which stabilize these hydrophobic peptides by membrane neutralization and water solvation and thus facilitate the insertion. However, CPPs interact with the cellular membrane in a non-invasive manner, while AMPs function by disrupting the lipid membrane. In addition, CPPs also experience charge\u2013charge interaction from the distal phosphate layer and the guanidinium\u2013phosphate interactions stabilize the CPP peptides in lipids and facilitate the insertion, while the plastic conformation and high mobility further promote the translocation.",

From these results a model was proposed whereby buforin 2 molecules would form a toroidal pore, just as magainin 2 does, but less stable; this would result in shorter pore lifetimes\u2014with a concomitant decrease in permeabilization\u2014at the same time that the translocation rate would increase because pore disintegration, which is the actual translocation step, would become more frequent [29, 30]. This model is supported by results that show that the presence of bilayer components that prevent the formation of toroidal pores (such as dioleyl phosphatidylethanolamine [31]) inhibit buforin 2 translocation, whereas anionic phospholipids, which decrease the charge repulsions between the cationic peptide molecules, stabilize the pore to a point that significant leakage and flip-flop is observed [30]. Buforin 2 translocation has also been shown to withstand cargo addition, as demonstrated by the attachment of green fluorescent protein [32], which makes this peptide a promising candidate for its development into a CPP. A \u201cmembrane-thinning\u201d effect was proposed for the AMP magainin 2 [33], in which the peptide aggregates on the surface of the membrane and the decreased local surface tension allows the peptide to intercalate the membrane.",

It is possible to make fully synthetic peptides by chemical synthesis [43] or by using recombinant expression systems [44]. These artificial sources of AMPs are useful for the modification of existing AMPs and for designing new synthetic AMPs. Such modifications have potential to change the targets of AMPs and improve the stability of AMPs against proteases [45]. Despite these advantageous features of AMPs, there are still some challenges to their applications, such as potential toxicity to humans [46], sensitivity to harsh environmental conditions (susceptibility to proteases and extreme pH) [47], lack of selectivity against specific strains [48], high production costs [49], folding issues of some large AMPs [50], reduced activity when used for surface coating, and bacterial resistance to some AMPs [51].",

The discovery of AMPs dates back to 1939, when Dubos extracted an antimicrobial agent from a soil Bacillus strain. This extract was demonstrated to protect mice from pneumococci infection. In the following year, Hotchkiss and Dubos fractionated this extract and identified an AMP which was named gramicidin [58]. In 1941, another AMP, tyrocidine, was discovered and found to be effective against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. However, tyrocidine exhibited toxicity to human blood cells. In the same year, another AMP was isolated from a plant Triticumaestivum, which was later named purothionin and found effective against fungi and some pathogenic bacteria [58]. The first reported animal-originated AMP is defensin, which was isolated from rabbit leukocytes in 1956. In the following years, bombinin from epithelia and lactoferrin from cow milk were both described. During the same time, it was also proven that human leukocytes contain AMPs in their lysosomes [58].",

Among these structural groups, \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet structures are more common [61] and \u03b1-helical peptides are the most studied AMPs to date. The best known examples of such AMPs are protegrin, magainin, cyclic indolicin, and coiled indolicin [57] and \u03b1-helical peptides without the presence of cysteines in the sequence, such as melittin [62]. \u03b2-Sheet peptides are composed of at least two \u03b2-strands with disulfide bonds between these strands [63], such as the protegrins [64]. And the AMPs with intermolecular disulfide bonds exhibiting loop/hairpin-like structures, such as bactenecin [65], belong to the third group.

            "text": "It is generally accepted that positively charged peptides interact directly with the negatively charged cellular membranes of bacterial cells, resulting in the increase of membrane permeability, which leads to a rapid cell death [77]. The groups of AMPs can be divided as: (a) antibacterials; (b) antivirals; (c) antifungals; (d) antiparasitics; and (e) anticancer peptides. AMPs kill bacteria by inhibiting some important pathways inside the cell such as DNA replication and protein synthesis [78]. Antiviral AMPs neutralize viruses by integrating in either the viral envelope or the host cell membrane. AMPs can integrate into viral envelopes and cause membrane instability, rendering the viruses unable to infect host cells [79]. AMPs can also reduce the binding of viruses to host cells [80]. Some of antifungal peptides are capable of binding to chitin. Such binding ability helps AMPs to target fungal cells efficiently. Cell wall-targeting antifungal AMPs kill the target cells by disrupting the integrity of fungal membranes by increasing permeabilization of the plasma membrane [81], or by forming pores directly [82]. An example of antiparasitic peptide is cathelicidin, which is able to kill Caernohabditis elegans by forming pores in the cell membrane [83]. Even though some parasitic microorganisms are multicellular, the mode of action of antiparasitic peptides is the same as other AMPs. They kill cells by directly interacting with cell membrane [83]. Anticancer peptides are also known as host defense peptides. They unction by targeting the cell membrane, as to date, more than 100 host defense peptides are known.",

Another successful approach is to modify the antiviral molecule to achieve cell-penetrating capabilities, like a direction taken by Zhang et al., in the case of which they used hydrocarbon stapling to create a more stable secondary structure and enhance the a-helicity of the peptide [106]. Following the success of the first hydrocarbon-stapled peptide, the research group has produced a wide range of such antiviral CPPs known as NYAD peptides [107, 108].",

The key elements in achieving the enhanced antiviral efficiency were once again the increased a-helicity and the amphipathic characteristics of the molecules, which further stresses the importance of these traits when developing antiviral CPPs. Some synthetic antiviral CPPs can also be a result of a lucky accident. While trying to improve the efficiency of their CPP-PNA conjugate [110] by adding a fatty acid domain, they created a CPP, which was an efficient antiviral agent even without the conjugated PNA. The infected cells treated with the peptide also demonstrated the tendency to release naked viral nucleocapsids that are extremely immunogenic, which could be used for vaccine-like immune system stimulation in the infected organism [111].",

While the main approach of the study was the prophylactic treatment against HSV-1 on the surface of the cell, it was noted that the particle is possibly internalized, in which case it can be classified as a CPP. This is further confirmed by additional study, where G2 has been conjugated to acyclovir in order to increase its antiviral efficiency [113].

For example, pyrrhocoricin consists of 20 amino acids and is an antimicrobial peptide isolated from insects, being effective against gram-negative bacteria but almost inactive against gram-positive strains [114]. Furthermore, pyrrhocoricin itself has been used as a drug delivery system. Otvos et al. investigated a modified pyrrhocoricin dimer that could successfully deliver peptide antigens into dendritic cells and human fibroblasts [115]. Another example is the antimicrobial protein lactoferrin (hLF), the human milk protein, which is a very important protein in immune defense due to its antifungal, antimicrobial, and antiviral activities [116]. The truncated version of this peptide consists of 49 amino acids and exhibits antimicrobial, antiviral, antitumor, and immunological activity [117] and was described to enter different cells efficiently (e.g. Hela or rat IEC-6). The uptake mechanism of the hLF peptide seems to be concentration-dependent and for concentration higher than 10 \u03bcM, rapid delivery into the cytoplasm and nucleus is observed. Furthermore, the uptake pathway was determined to be sensitive to rottlerin, a protein kinase inhibitor with specificity for protein kinase C (PKC). This was also observed for the uptake of arginine-rich CPPs such as Tat and R9 [118]. The uptake efficiency is supposed to be conformation-dependent, because the cyclic structure is required for binding to heparin sulfate and correlates with lipid-induced conformational changes. Several examples of efficient cargo delivery have been described for the hLF peptide; especially proteins and high-molecular-weight complexes have been successfully transported [119].",

It also belongs to the Pro/Arg-rich family and was described to be antimicrobially active against gram-negative bacteria in a micromolar range but not against gram-positive strains [121]. The antimicrobial effect is caused by inhibition of the intracellular protein synthesis machinery in a two-step mechanism, where the first is entry of the peptide into the cytoplasm and the second is intracellular inhibition of its target [120]. Generally, the longer segments of Bac-7, containing antibacterial and intracellular delivery regions, have antibacterial and cell-permeating activity.

With the help of this, peptide transport of covalently coupled doxorubicin to the brain has been reported. The blood\u2013brain barrier was crossed with high efficiency and without any compromise to its integrity [122]. Another example is buforin II, a 21-amino-acid antimicrobial peptide that was discovered in stomach tissue of Asian toad. It penetrates through the cell membrane without destroying it and kills bacteria by binding to nucleic acids. BF2d, which is a modified analog of buforin II, exhibits cell-penetrating properties and is able to deliver the GFP protein to HeLa cells [32]. Recently, a cathelicidin-derived carrier peptide, sC18, has been developed. This peptide originates from the 18-kDa cationic antimicrobial protein (CAP18) that was first isolated from rabbit leukocytes. Like the hLF protein, CAP18 is a lipopolysaccharide binding protein with an \u03b1-helical structure [123].

Another interesting result was produced by Chaubey et al., who described that a Transportan-PNA molecule, which had previously been shown to display significant antiviral efficiency (14a), is also a potent virucidal agent, rendering HIV-1 virions pre-treated with the conjugate noninfectious, suggesting a probable prophylactic medical application for their molecule [129]. PNA-CPPs such as the Tat-FS can also be used to block the frameshift process required for the replication of such viruses as SARS-Coronavirus, making them a viable tool against any viruses that require frameshifting to take place during their replication [130]. A successful Tat-based application of PNAs has been shown to lead to Japanese encephalitis virus inhibition by competing with RdRp through interactions with its binding sites at 3\u2032 regions of the RNA [131].",

Hexa-arginine with a synthetic peptide mimicking a \u03b2-sheet/loop motif commonly found in the C-terminal domain of the Chandipura virus P protein binds the positive-sense leader RNA to inhibit virus replication [136]. Heat shock protein gp96 has been fused to Tat-peptide in an attempt to enhance T-cell-based immune responses. This led to increased antiviral and antitumor potency and to the inhibition of HBV in mice [137]. Protease-inhibiting peptides have been developed against HCV infection. These molecules were conjugated to a selection of CPPs and the fusion with Antennapedia was regarded as the approach with the highest efficiency [138]. Peptide-targeting HIV-1 capsid formation has been successfully applied using a commercial CPP-based transfection reagent, Chariot. What makes this development especially interesting is that this is one of the rare occasions upon which the molecule of interest is not conjugated to the transfection peptide covalently but employs non-covalent bonding strategy instead [139]. The approach to target the capsid of the virus has also been used in HCV inhibition\u2014the capsid has been targeted by R7 in fusion with nucleocapsid binding subunits. In addition to its inhibition of envelopment, the peptide conjugate also blocks the subsequent viral particle release [140].",

PMOs have been utilized in an approach against murine hepatitis virus, which is a member of coronavirus family which holds such other, better known members, such as SARS. Various arginine-rich PPMO combinations were compared and it resulted in the selection of (R-Ahx-R)4AhxB\u2013PPMO over R9F2C\u2013PPMO and Tat-PPMO based on their delivery efficiency in a splice-correcting model system [142] and antiviral efficiencies targeted against 5\u2032-terminal nucleotides of the viral genome [143]. The P007 CPP-conjugated PMO targeting the 3\u2032 region of the internal ribosomal entry site was shown to hold great potency against the coxsackievirus B3, a known cause for viral myocarditis, both in cell culture and in mice, showing a perspective for further therapeutic research [144]. PMOs in combination with arginine-rich CPPs, such as AVI-6002 and AVI-6003 have also been reported to be capable of inhibiting Ebola and Marburg viruses respectively. The main mechanism of action for these molecules is the inhibition of viral mRNA translation, which leads to the inhibition of the whole replication process [88].",

This approach, combined with the fact that some CPPs do not affect viruses, allows the conduction of research related to viral replication. If to introduce a CPP-drug conjugate into the cellular environment that completely inhibits late-stage virion formation, it could create a setting in which it is easier to observe viral replication without the need to create replicon models of the original virus, the downside of which is that while they do carry out the replication in a similar way to the virus of interest, they are still, in essence, a shortened version of the original genome, resulting in a possible change of replication speeds and cellular immune response [148]. In the case of highly mutagenic viruses, such as HIV-1, it would also open up the possibility to efficiently research the abilities of the viruses to overcome some obstacle in their life cycle\u2014for example which beneficial mutations is the virus capable of obtaining if a certain replication stage or pathway is blocked.
