Given this particular practical relevance, a plethora of digital maturity models, designed to asses a company's digital status quo, has emerged over the past few years. Largely developed and published by practitioners, the academic value of these models remains obviously unclear. To shed light on their value in a broader sense, in this paper we critically evaluate 17 existing digital maturity modelsidentified through a systematic literature search (2011-2019)with regard to their validity of measurement. We base our evaluation on established academic criteria, such as generalizability or theory-based interpretation, that we apply in a qualitative content analysis to these models. Our analysis shows that most of the identified models do not conform to the established evaluation criteria. Based on these insights, we derive a detailed research agenda and suggest respective research questions and strategies.",

The goal is to seize the opportunities of the ongoing digital transformation [1] . To evaluate the status quo of a company's digitalization and to provide guidance for future investments, latest IS literature has established the term digital maturity. Following Chanias and Hess, digital maturity is \"the status of a company's digital transformation\"it describes \"what a company has already achieved with regard to transformation efforts\" [2] . Here, efforts include implemented changes from an operational point of view as well as acquired capabilities regarding the mastering of the transformation process. In this context, given the high practical relevance of the topic, a great variety of so-called digital maturity models (DMMs) has emerged in the past few years. According to Mettler [3] this trend will prevail as the demand for maturity models will further increase.",

Based on this catalogue, we will evaluate and compare relevant DMMs identified through a systematic literature search. Finally, after a discussion of this evaluation, we propose a research agenda to remedy shortcomings of existing maturity models and provide guidance for future research. The term maturity can be defined as \"the ability to respond to the environment in an appropriate manner through management practices\" [10] . According to Scott and Bruce maturity with regards to an organization is a \"reflection of the appropriateness of its measurement and management practices in the context of its strategic objectives and in response to environmental change\" [11] . Rosemann and de Bruin describe maturity more pragmatically as \"a measure to evaluate the capabilities of an organization in regard to a certain discipline\" [12, p. 2] . Scholars agree that the organization's reaction to its external environment is generally learned rather than instinctive. However, the maturity of an organization does not necessarily relate to its age.",

Defining and assessing the maturity of different types of organizational resources allows organizations to evaluate their capabilities with respect to different business areas. In this context, for example, the maturity of certain organizational processes, objects or technologies can be the focus of such a reflection. Based on this concept, maturity models are multistage frameworks to describe a typical path in the development of organizational capabilities [12] . Here, the different levels are conceptualized in terms of evolutionary stages [13] . Maturity models can be described as normative reference models. In general, they are applied in organizations in order to assess the current status quo of a set of capabilities, to derive measures for improvement and prioritize them accordingly [1] . Through a set of benchmark variables and indicators for each stage, the matrix frameworks offer a possibility to make the progress of an object of interest towards a desired state tangible [14] . The relationship between maturity and organizational performance is properly understood, e.g. higher maturity leads to higher performance [15] .",

In addition to deriving major search terms through PICO, we identified synonyms and alternative spellings for these keywords by consulting both experts and literature of this field [26] . As a result the following keywords were compiled: \"maturity model\", \"stages of growth model\". \"stage model\", \"change model\", \"transformation model\", and \"grid\". In addition, we framed the literature search using \"Information Technology\" and \"Digital*\". Lastly, when constructing the search strings, we used both the Boolean AND and OR to on the one hand link the major terms derived in the first step and on the other hand to incorporate these synonyms and alternative spellings in our systematic literature search. We first applied the search strings to the IS journals and conferences to check for the accuracy of the search terms.

Five models omit giving any definition of the concept of digital maturity itself or of related concepts such as digital transformation or digitization.

Dimensions of the target domain are for example: customer experience, operational processes, business models and digital capabilities. Furthermore, the vast majority of the DMMs have a predefined measurement approach as well as a fairly large sample. A large stake of the models does not provide any information about the degree of standardization in the measurement undertaken.

Most existing DMMs are tested through real data, but the quality of the methods and approaches applied largely differs or cannot be evaluated at all. For example, in most of the analyzed papers, the data collection procedure is not transparently explained. Thus, our first call with regardsto empirical aspects is to increase transparency of both sampling and data collection. Furthermore, depending on the focus of the model, it could be beneficial to concentrate Longitudinal studies on specific data groups such as certain company sizes or certain cultures. The second call concerns the methods applied to analyse the data. In most cases, DMMs can be considered as quantitative in nature, which is particularly useful when the goal is for example a comparison between different companies. However, a qualitative approach could contributeto the measurement quality of a company's digital maturity. Qualitative research settings have proven to be especially useful in the process of DMM development [6] . The scope of our suggested research agenda clearly shows that there is a number of significant shortcomings with regards to the measurement validity of existing DMMs. Correspondingly, the overall quality and theoretical value of DMMs is put to the test.",
