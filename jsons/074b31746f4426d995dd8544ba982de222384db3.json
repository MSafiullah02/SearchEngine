            "text": "Using a respiratory virus epidemiological model we derive equations for the critical levels of mask efficiency (fraction blocked) and mask adoption (fraction of population wearing masks) that lower the effective reproduction number to unity. The model extends a basic epidemiological model and assumes that a specified fraction of a population dons masks at a given initial number of infections. The model includes a contribution from the ocular (nasolacrimal duct) route, and does not include contributions from contact (fomite) routes. The model accommodates dose-response (probability of infection) functions that are linear or non-linear. Our motivation to study near-population-wide mask wearing arises from the concept that, between two mask wearers, the concentration of particles at inhalation should be the square of the mask penetration fraction. This combination, or team, of masks can provide a strong dose-lowering squaring effect, which enables the use of lower-efficiency, lowercost, lower pressure-drop (easier breathing) masks.",

Importantly, this efficiency is well below that of a N95 mask, and well above that of some fabric masks. Numerical solutions of the model at near-critical levels of mask efficiency and mask adoption demonstrate avoidance of epidemics. To be conservative we use mask efficiencies measured with the mostpenetrating viral-particle sizes. The critical mask adoption level for surgical masks with an efficiency of 0.58 is computed to be 0.73. With surgical masks (or equally efficient substitutes) and 80% and 90% adoption levels, respiratory epidemics with R 0 of about 3 and 4, respectively, would be theoretically extinguished.",

The population can undertake various nonpharmaceutical measures such as physical distancing, quarantining (based on symptoms, testing, contact-tracking), work and school closures, travel restrictions, careful hand-hygiene and wearing masks [1, 2] . While applying all of these measures simultaneously would be the most effective, the impact on society may become immense. Therefore it is valuable to gauge the relative benefit provided by various measures. Herein we use a mathematical epidemiological model to examine the efficacy of near population-wide adoption of masks.",

High-speed photography of visible droplets during sneezing events have shown ranges of roughly 8m [6] , but such events are rare [5] , especially during a pandemic where generally people have a heightened awareness to not cough or sneeze among others. High-speed laser-aided photography of talking at close-range revealed numerous visible droplets in the range of 20-500 \u03bcm [7] . Droplets captured at close-range and smaller than 5 \u03bcm have been reported to contain about nine-fold more viral copies than larger particles [8] . Small droplets can evaporate to form droplet-nuclei that can remain airborne [3] . Talking for five minutes can generate the same number of droplet nuclei as a cough [3] . The viability of aerosol viral particles has been demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 for the three hour duration of an experiment [9] . Non-symptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission can be significant [10, 11] . An example of this is where 40 of 60 participants at a choir practice became infected with COVID-19, despite distancing and without coughing or sneezing [10] . With SARS, community wearing of masks when going out was associated with a 70% reduction in risk compared with never wearing a mask [12] . Mask wearing can reduce exposure especially in situations where physical distancing is difficult. Taiwan, with a population of 24 million, has only had six COVID-19 deaths, had significant surgical mask use plus other measures and early action [13] .",

The ocular route for viral particles is modeled in Fig 1 as a passage of the incident concentration through a filter denoted f ocular . It is implicit in the dose integral above that f ocular was measured during breathing. We estimate f ocular based on data in Fig 2 of [21] , as follows. The control group (Group 1) in [21] had no masks or goggles, and an ocular-exposure-only group (Group 2) had a half-mask with clean air supply. These groups were equally exposed to a standardized aerosol concentration of live attenuated influenza vaccine. Afterwards they used nasal washes followed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to count the resulting number of Influenza RNA copies. The control group would have had count-contributions from both inhalation, n inh , and from ocular paths, n oc , so its count of 504 consists of n inh + n oc . The ocular-path-only group count had n oc =5. Assuming linearity of the quantitative RT-PCR tests, then the ratio n oc /n inh =0.01 is the fraction of viral particles that pass through the ocular route compared to the inhaled route, which is indeed the parameter f ocular that we seek. The ocular route transmission is about 100 times lower than inhaling without a mask, so masks would be the most effective first-approach to lowering the dose.",

Masks are typically much better at blocking larger droplets, therefore it is prudent to measure mask efficiency at the most-penetrating particle-size (MPS) for infective particles. Viral particles and bacteria range from about 0.02 to 1.26 \u03bcm [23] . (It was noted in [23] that the size of the influenza and SARS-CoV-1 viruses happen to coincide with the most-penetrating particle-size for N95 respirators.) If a population stocked MPS-rated masks in advance of a novel respiratory virus, then the masks would perform at least as well as those worstcase efficiencies over a wide range of particle sizes, and regardless of whether the transmission is predominantly by droplets or by aerosols.",

Recall that p i 0 is the probability of a contact being infected, where this probability is representative of all contacts.

The lower half of the diagram represents the concentration of particles (normalized at the source, and along a straight line between faces). The non-normalized concentration would depend on the event, e.g. exhalation, speaking, coughing, sneezing. The gain g(d,t) <1 is a non-linear function of distance, time, the event, and other factors. For sufficient distance the concentration would decline such that infection becomes unlikely without masks. The mask on the infectious person is modeled as a filter with a transmission gain (fraction that penetrates ) during exhalation of 0< f t , exh \u2a7d1 . Similarly, the mask on the susceptible person has a filter transmission during inhalation of 0< f t , inh \u2a7d1. Not wearing a mask corresponds to a filter transmission of 1. The four combinations of mask wearing, (none, either one, both) lead to four lower concentrations given by the respective products of the mask filter gains. For identical masks with low-flow events (e.g. breathing, speaking) the exhalation and inhalation filter gains may be modeled as being equal, f t . In that case, with both people wearing masks, the product of the filter gains is the square of their values. For example, when both people wear a f t =0.1 mask, then the resultant concentration f t =0.1 =0.01 , which is 100 times lower than no masks, and 10 times lower than a single mask. While this advantage decreases for weaker filters, the potential strength of that squaring effect motivates examination of what mask filtering ability and mask adoption level would significantly reduce epidemic strength.The ocular route is through the nasolacrimal duct and its significance is discussed in the text. For influenza, it appears to be on the order of 100 times less significant than inhalation..
