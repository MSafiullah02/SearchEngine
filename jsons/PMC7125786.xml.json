            "text": "The microcantilever sensor has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Using immobilized receptor molecules, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids, as well as cells and microorganisms, microcantilevers have been applied to a variety of problems to detect molecular interactions [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Furthermore, microcantilever arrays are extremely sensitive and can detect picomolar amounts of analyte in a complex background [8]. The principle behind the microcantilever sensing mechanism is the transduction of biomolecular interactions into a nanomechanical force. Analytes bind to receptor molecules that are immobilized on the surface of the microcantilever, and this causes changes in surface stress. This, in turn, generates a nanomechanical force that bends the microcantilever. An optical laser, focused on the microcantilever apex, is deflected as the microcantilever bends, allowing for direct measurement of receptor\u2013analyte binding. Microcantilevers have advantages over other sensor techniques, including the ability to measure binding interactions in real time. A unique microcantilever feature is that measurements can be conducted both in air and solution, which may be particularly useful for detecting microbes. Furthermore, in contrast to most comparable technologies, small amounts of receptor and analyte are needed, and molecular labels are not required.",

            "text": "The stress originates from intermolecular interaction in the film of receptor molecules and transmits through the linker between the receptor molecule and microcantilever surface, and then ultimately, arrives at microcantilever surface and causes the bending. For microcantilever sensor based on surface stress effect, how to maximize the stress transmission from the molecular interaction to microcantilever surface is an important way of increasing the detection sensitivity of microcantilever sensor. The linker size between the surface and the receptor may play a key role in the stress transmission. Antibody immobilization on the surface is known as an important factor of the assay sensitivity. Different reagents used in receptor molecule (antibody) immobilization result in differences in the linker molecule sizes. Various reagents suitable for antibody immobilization have been described in literatures for different molecules detections. These reagents include homobifunctional cross-linkers dithiobis (succinimidylundecanoate) (DSU) [9], sulfosuccinimidyl 6-[3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionamido] hexanoate (sulfo-LC-SPDP) [10], N-succinimidyl S-acetyl thioacetate (SATA) [11] and 2-iminothiolane hydrochloride (2-IT) [12], [13], [14], and monothiol linkers 3-mercaptopropionic acid [15], 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) [16], cysteamine [17] and aminoethanethiol [18]. In these sulfhydrylation reagents, the linker molecules are straight alky chains, and there are 2-carbon chain length between the surface and the antibody for SATA, 3-mercaptopropionic acid, cysteamine and aminoethanethiol; 3-carbon chain length for 2-IT; 9-carbon chain length for sulfo-LC-SPDP; 10-carbon chain length for DSU and MUA. In these different detections (or sulfhydrylation reagents), the microcantilevers show different sensitivities. For straight carbon chain, the carbon chain length may be critical to stress transmission, and ultimately affects the assay sensitivity. However, because of different affinities of antibody used in these detections, it cannot be evaluated how the chain length affects the stress transmission and the sensitivity. A same receptor molecule should be used.",

            "text": "Often, selective receptors are immobilized on the microcantilever surface using alkanethiol linkers, which form self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on the gold-coated surface of the microcantilever. These thiolated molecules are chosen due to the strong affinity of sulfur head groups with the gold surface of the microcantilever. However, not much information is available on the mechanical properties of SAMs, especially regarding the nature of stress transmission of alkanethiol. Berger et al. showed that, during vapor-phase n-alkanethiol adsorption on microcantilever surface, the difference in surface stress response correlates well with differences in chain length of n-alkanethiol, and longer-chain alkanethiol on the cantilever surfaces results in larger surface stress values [19]. Desikan et al. investigated, in the liquid phase, the effect of chain length on the nanomechanical stress generation on microcantilever surfaces during the adsorption of n-alkanethiols of different chain lengths and showed that adsorption of shorter-chain alkanethiols on the cantilever surfaces results in larger surface stress values [20]. Both Berger and Desikan study the effect of chain length at the step of the alkanethiols adsorption on the microcantilever, due to the binding of sulfur head groups of alkanethiols to the gold surface of the microcantilever. However, there is no report on the effect of chain length of alkanethios when it is used as a linker that links the receptor to the microcantilever surface.",

The quality of the raw herbs used in the CPMs affects the final therapeutic outcomes and consumer safety.

Existing methods for the determination of GL include high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [27], liquid chromatography\u2013ion trap mass spectrometry (LC\u2013ITMS) [28], capillary electrophoresis [29]. However, these methods of detection of herbal ingredients are complex, time consuming, and require costly and bulky instrumentation. Immunoassay based detection techniques are being developed as an alternative to detect these GL in samples. There are reports of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) based on monoclonal antibody (MAb) against GL [26]. The ELISA reported by Mizutani et al. had a detect range of 20\u2013200 ng/mL. Such assays are highly specific and exhibit the necessary sensitivity and accuracy for the detection of these low molecular weight active compounds of CHMs. Although having individual strength, each assay currently suffers from the inability to identify or quantify the GL for quality control marker of licorice root. True universal label-free detection of these herb ingredients for highly sensitive and specific detection in a high-throughput fashion is not yet a reality.",

Fig. 2\nshows the deflection profiles for antibody\u2013antigen binding, where antibodies were immobilized using self-assembled monolayer (SAM), based on (a) thioglycolic acid (HSCH2COOH), (b) 6-mercaptohexanoic acid (HS(CH2)5COOH), (c) 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (HS(CH2)10COOH), and (d) 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (HS(CH2)15COOH) (corresponding to n\n = 1, 5, 10 and 15, respectively in Fig. 1). It can be seen that the functionalized microcantilevers rapidly bent, reaching an equilibrium bending signal. The bending occurs because the binding between GL antibody\u2013antigen interactions produces a difference in surface stress between the functionalized surface on the top and the silicon surface on the back side of the microcantilever. The response of the microcantilever shows that the deflection increases significantly when the concentration of GL increases. It can be seen from Fig. 2(a) that the microcantilever bent rapidly for higher concentration (100 ng/mL), reaching an equilibrium bending signal \u0394z\n \u223c 133 nm under constant flow conditions. For lower concentration (1 ng/mL), the bending of microcantilever was smaller (\u0394z\n \u223c 64 nm). The other charts where the antibodies were immobilized via SAMs of other n-alkanethiols (n\n = 5, 10 and 15) in Fig. 2 show the same trend. To evaluate the specificity of the technique, reference microcantilever without antibody was exposed to 1000 ng/mL of GL. No significant response was observed, indicating little interferences from nonspecific small molecules on the microcantilever sensor (Fig. 2). Licorice sample with four-year-old cultivated was detected with antibody immobilized using SAM based on the shortest alkanethiol (HSCH2COOH). The concentration of GL detected with the microcantilever was approximately 8.6 ng/mL (dark black curve in Fig. 2(a)), and it was 10.16 ng/mL with icELISA [30]. The average recovery of GL determined with the microcantilever was 84.6%. Our investigation shows that microcantilevers based on the nanomechanical response have the sensitivity for label-free detection of GL and quantify the binding affinity of the GL antibody and GL as the antigen.",

The binding of antibodies to the layer of n-alkanethiols produced the SPR responses of 2482 RU (n\n = 1), 2586 RU (n\n = 5), 2694 RU (n\n = 10) and 2484 RU (n\n = 15) (Fig. 3\n), respectively. The results show that the surface concentrations of immobilized antibodies were almost equal for different n-alkanethiols used. Specifically, for n\n = 1 and n\n = 15, the SPR responses (2482 and 2484 RU) were equal, but the sensitivities of the microcantilever for n\n = 1 and 15 are very different. These indicate the difference in the sensitivity of the microcantilever sensor is not caused by different surface concentrations of immobilized antibodies but the chain length of n-alkanethiol.",

The stress (or strain) originates from antigen\u2013antibody binding and is transmitted through the linker to the microcantilever surface, and ultimately, causes the microcantilever bending. Thus it can be seen that the length of the carbon chain plays a key role in the stress transmission. Fig. 4\nshows the steady-state microcantilever deflection as a function of different GL concentration and different chain lengths of linker (n\n = 1, 5, 10, 15) that is between the surface and the antibody. Each point represents the average for three determinations and the error bars represent the standard deviation of data. It is clear to see that the sensitivity of the microcantilever increases significantly with decreasing chain length of linker. These findings suggest that short carbon chain transmits stress (or strain) more efficiently. This result is, to our knowledge, the first direct proof that the carbon chain length is very important for the transmission of mechanical response that originates from biochemical reaction. Our findings are of substantive importance, not only for microcantilever studies but for all investigations of biological interfaces, where the linker is a carbon chain. Although the work presented herein is focused on biochemically well-defined interfaces, these findings will also be important for our understanding of mechanical signal transmission of biological interfaces and membranes.",

In Fig. 5(a), the LOD were the points at which the calculated lines and the lines of the 3 times the background noises intersected. The LODs for different chain length of linker were determined to be as low as 20 pg/mL (n\n = 1), 130 pg/mL (n\n = 5), 1.7 ng/mL (n\n = 10) and 10 ng/mL (n\n = 15), respectively, and the LOD for the shortest linker is 500 times lower than the longest linker. The LOD of conventional indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) for the antigen and antibody used here was 1.1 ng/mL [30]. The LOD of the microcantilever sensor (20 pg/mL) for the GL was 50 times lower than that of the corresponding icELISA. We can see that the chain length of linker has great influence on the LOD.
