Because the parasite infects all RBCs regardless of their age, it can cause very high parasitemia. Because it induces RBCs to grow PfEMP-1 knobs on their surface with resulting entrapment of the mature protozoa in the microcirculation, tissue injury is much more severe in falciparum malaria, with manifestations including cerebral malaria, placenta infection with adverse effects on pregnancy, and pulmonary edema or the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2\u20134]. Uncomplicated falciparum malaria manifestations include fever (every day initially, especially in travelers without prior semi-immunity; with prior semi-immunity, a fever every other day is often seen) and many associated symptoms (e.g., headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and profuse sweats). The complete blood count usually shows anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a normal white blood cell count. Even uncomplicated falciparum malaria can progress rapidly to severe illness. P. falciparum can result in a large number of complications (see Table 46.3), and treatment is considered an emergency. Because P. falciparum has acquired drug resistance to multiple antimalarial agents, including chloroquine, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, mefloquine, quinine, and recently artemisinin derivatives, treatment always includes two different agents, and choice of therapy depends on the severity of illness. Acutely ill patients are best treated in the intensive care unit with rapidly acting intravenous agents, such as quinidine, quinine, or artesunate, plus a second active drug (doxycycline or clindamycin). Patients who are stable and can take oral therapy usually receive one of three combinations: atovaquone/proguanil, artemether/lumefantrine, or a combination of quinine plus either doxycycline or clindamycin [2\u20135].\n",

It causes zoonotic human malaria in Malaysia (especially Borneo), with cases reported elsewhere (Thailand, Myanmar, Singapore, and Philippines). Blood smears show tiny ring forms (like P. falciparum) and band forms (like P. malariae, with which it is confused). It results in a higher mortality than non-falciparum malaria, and chloroquine is an effective therapy [1\u20135].Key Points/Pearls\nP. falciparum\nsmears only show young ring forms, but no mature trophozoites or schizonts because these are entrapped in the microcirculation.Banana-shaped gametocytes are pathognomonic of P. falciparum, but are not seen in recently infected travelers; gametocytes appear late and are seen alone in non-ill persons in endemic areas.Relapsing malaria only occurs with P. vivax and P. ovale; the term \u201crelapse\u201d in malaria has a specific meaning: the appearance of blood-stage parasites originating from a dormant liver stage of the parasite, called a hypnozoite.Malaria relapses occur in 50% of persons infected with P. vivax or P. ovale, for up to 1\u20133 years after infection.Only primaquine (30 mg base a day for 14 days) kills hypnozoites, but there is a risk of severe intravascular hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency.Proper malaria prophylaxis in most areas is mefloquine taken weekly or either atovaquone/proguanil or doxycycline taken daily; malaria prophylaxis is continued after returning to a non-endemic area for 1 week with atovaquone/proguanil and for 4 weeks with either doxycycline or mefloquine.\n",
