Our study about the HCoV has contributed extensively to the understanding of HCoV pathogenesis its outbreak and precautionary measurements mainly COVID-19. By the 16-February 2020, total existing diagnosis cases of COVID-19, in china now numbered around 57,255, total cumulative diagnosis is about 68,592, total existing suspicion is about 8228, a total severe existing disease 11,272, the total cumulative cure is about 9671 with more than 1666 cumulative deaths have been reported. The purpose of the review is to summarize the present knowledge on the viral diversity, reservoir hosts, and geographical distributions of Human coronavirus in China.",

            "text": "Human coronaviruses have been identified as mild respiratory pathogens that affect the human population. However, it was the emergence of COVID-19 that thrust these HCoV into the spotlight of the research field. The outbreak of COVID-19 is considered more severe than the previous SARS-CoV and MERS. Therefore most of the HCoV research today is concerned towards 2019-nCoV which has been recently named COVID-19. More emerging HCoVs might likely surface to threaten global public health. As the high mortality rates of the two past outbreaks i.e. SARS-CoV 10%, and MERS-CoV 35%. Therefore, the study of the pathogenesis of all HCoVs especially COVID-19 would gain more insights for the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines.",

The major reservoir for MERS-CoV is dromedary camels (Reusken et al. 2016). In 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV causes mild to severe fever, cough, diarrhea and shortness of breath (De Wit et al., 2013. Both viruses; MERS and MERS-CoV are zoonotic. Nevertheless, both viruses can be transmitted from human to human (de Wit et al., 2016). In contrast, a few other human CoVs of zoonotic origin only cause mild infections of the respiratory tract, such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (Gaunt et al. 2010). In 2004-2005, two more human coronaviruses were discovered (HCoV-NL63) causes mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections and sever lower tract infection and (HKU1) causes acute respiratory distress and pneumonia",
