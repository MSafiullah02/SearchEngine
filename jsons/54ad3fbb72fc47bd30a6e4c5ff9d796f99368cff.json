This version will undergo additional copyediting, typesetting and review before it is published in its final form, but we are providing this version to give early visibility of the article. Please note that, during the production process, errors may be discovered which could affect the content, and all legal disclaimers that apply to the journal pertain. We read with great interest the article by Chang et al 1 , in which they reported COVID-19 infection unmasking Brugada Syndrome but they report, finally, that it's the fever who unmasking Brugada pattern. We want to congratulate authors, which demonstrates COVID-19 infection may be another etiology to expose a Brugada pattern. We agree with most of the statements provide in the present work, but our main concern is the lack of rigor since it's nothing new that fever is capable to unmask Brugada pattern and this hallmark has already been previously reported in large cohort series. 5 reported that premature inactivation of the sodium channel is accentuated at higher temperatures, suggesting that febrile states may unmask certain Brugada Syndrome patients or temporarily increase the risk of arrhythmia, mainly in Caucasians males. So, We would like it to be learned that any condition that predisposes to fever may unmask a Brugada pattern and not the COVID-19 infection.",
