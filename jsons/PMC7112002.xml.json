The pneumonia was highly contagious and affected those who had been in close contact with the patients, such as health care workers and family members of the patients. The etiologic agent of this atypical pneumonia was not identified initially, and in many patients, their chest condition rapidly deteriorated and resulted in death.1 In late February 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention termed this condition severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).1\n",

Those other hotel guests staying on the same floor as this medical doctor, as well as their visitors, contracted the disease through social contacts.

Eventually, a virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from a lung biopsy specimen and from a nasopharyngeal aspirate. Subsequent investigations found that patients with SARS showed a serologic response to this virus.8 The family Coronaviridae includes the genus Coronavirus and Torovirus. Both of these are RNA viruses that are known to cause a variety of diseases in human beings and animals. A major cause of the common cold is related to the Coronavirus: types 229E and OC43.9 These viruses occasionally are responsible for causing pneumonia in neonates or in elderly, debilitated, or immunocompromised patients. Some animal coronaviruses such as the avian infectious bronchitis virus might cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, or neurologic diseases.10 Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique (RT-PCR), investigators first identified the sequence of a polymerase gene from a Coronavirus in the nasopharyngeal aspirate of 1 patient.8 With the use of similar techniques, the isolation and identification of segments of this viral RNA were also confirmed from the throat swabs of patients with SARS.11 The genome of the SARS-associated Coronavirus has now been sequenced, and this might be useful in the development of an antiviral agent or vaccine.12\n",

These included RT-PCR tests targeting the polymerase gene of the virus and serologic tests using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescent assay to detect the SARS-associated Coronavirus antibodies. The RT-PCR test is sensitive when specimens collected from the lower respiratory tract or stool are used. Serologic tests are reliable when patients show a rising titer, although the seroconversion time lag may be long in some patients.18 Future research along this line should be directed at the development of a more sensitive test that would detect alternate target genes such as the nucleocapsid gene, which is more abundant than the replicase gene of the virus.19\n",

The route of infection is through the mucosal membranes or conjunctiva. The mode of spreading is through direct contact of the virus, which is believed to be transported via aerosol and fine droplets. This has posed a significant threat to medical and nursing staff caring for these patients, especially when the patients are receiving ventilatory support, in which frequent suctioning to remove bronchial secretions is mandatory. The first index patient in Hong Kong was admitted on February 22, 2003. By April 18, 2003, the total number of clinically confirmed patients with SARS in Hong Kong was 1523, of whom 316 (20.7%) were health care workers, including medical doctors, nurses, and hospital ward attendants. The overall mortality rate was about 15%, and it was 3 times higher among patients who had an associated chronic illness.",

More than 50% of patients showed a rapid and sustained response, and 45% showed steady improvement with these management strategies.25 With this treatment regimen, the associated morbidity was acceptable, and the patient mortality rate was markedly reduced.",
