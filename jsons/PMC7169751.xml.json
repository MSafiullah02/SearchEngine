There are numerous challenges for the attainment of this goal, and diverse approaches ranging from insulin pumps to gene therapy to stem cell strategies are all being pursued.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 In another approach, the replacement of lost islet cells through human islet allotransplantation has established the clinical utility of islet grafting.6, 7 Although only 13% of human islet recipients remain insulin\u2010independent at 5 years, the majority of patients (67%) retain some graft function as evidenced by persistent C\u2010peptide secretion.8 Importantly, islet transplantation largely eliminates hypoglycemic unawareness post\u2010grafting. Further improvement in long\u2010term insulin independence is likely; data from a few select institutions indicate that an increasing number of islet recipients (approaching 50%) are able to maintain external insulin independence for 5 years.9 Nonetheless, the availability of suitable human pancreases for either whole organ or isolated islet transplantation is entirely inadequate as evidenced by the recovery of only 1293 donor pancreases in the United States in 2015.10\n",

Porcine islets are particularly suitable as a source of insulin\u2010producing cells because porcine insulin differs from human insulin by only a single amino acid and porcine insulin has been shown to provide reliable and safe glycemic control in human diabetic patients. Furthermore, only the transplantation of whole pancreas or intact islets of Langerhans can be expected to replicate normal and precise physiological glucose control, which is dependent on a variety of cell types and proteins from pancreatic islets. This enormously complex regulatory machinery is absent in all other approaches to the re\u2010establishment of normoglycemia.",

Although small immune mediators, such as cytokines, can still enter the macrobead, this encapsulation approach has been sufficiently robust to allow spontaneously diabetic BB rats to survive for more than 6 months without immunosuppression and without exogenous insulin administration.13 Ongoing studies in non\u2010immunosuppressed diabetic cynomolgus macaques also demonstrate porcine islet macrobead function for more than 6 months in 5 of 6 animals (unpublished data, see Checkpoint 4 below).",

A strategy to provide an aseptic product and to reduce the probability of inadvertent transmission of adventitious viruses is critical to the successful implementation of this exciting therapy. Our approach takes advantage of the unique aspects of the islet macrobead, namely its long\u2010term viability in culture and lack of patient immunosuppression, to limit the microbiological safety risk of porcine islets for transplantation. Essential to our approach is the establishment of four checkpoints that span the macrobead production and transplantation processes. The checkpoint approach is built upon an increasing level of microbiological screening from the donor herd up to the islet product, using multiple assay formats with the ability to screen for known and unknown pathogens. Using the checkpoint approach, we provide evidence to support the use of donor animals housed in high hygienic but not HEPA\u2010filtered environments, not only for islet xenotransplantation but also other xeno\u2010cell therapies. In this study, we present and document the effectiveness of our microbiological safety strategy to minimize the microbiological risks of agarose encapsulated porcine islets for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.",

The Source Animal Facility is an independently owned herd located in rural Southwest Ohio. The breeding herd numbers approximately 2000 sows and utilizes a two\u2010tiered quarantine testing system through a modern multisite production strategy. Three segregated facilities (nursery, gilt isolation, and farrowing and gestation) maintain data records and follow standard operating procedures (SOPs) for animal husbandry, vaccination, housing, cleaning and waste management, and biosecurity measures. Controlled transportation of animals, supplies and semen, feeding and watering, pest and rodent control, gravel barrier around facility perimeter, and caretaker qualifications including routine health assessments are all components of the comprehensive biosecurity program. Routine Quality Assurance site audits are used to verify compliance. Corn\u2010based pig feed was produced exclusively with corn grown and ground onsite at the source animal facility. Gilts, gestation sows, and lactating sows were given the same base feed, consisting of corn with various supplements (eg, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, protein), with slight variations based on the breeding status of the animal. All ingredients used in the production of complete feed were certified to be free of any restricted use protein products as defined in the FDA Code of Federal Regulation Title 21 Part 589.2001 (21 CFR 589.2001) pertaining to cattle materials prohibited in animal feed. Complete medical histories are archived for all source animals. The facility holds Pork Quality Assurance Plus (PQA Plus\u00ae) certification, which is a producer\u2010driven program to ensure U.S. pork products are of the highest quality and safe.16 The PQA Plus program mandates Good Production Practices with an emphasis on biosecurity and practices to reduce the risk of introducing and spreading of infectious agents.

Islet counts were expressed as islet equivalents (IEQ), based on a standard islet size of 150 \u03bcm, and 500 IEQ were encapsulated in agarose\u2010agarose macrobeads as previously described.18 Following quantification, islets were separated into 2000 IEQ aliquots before being resuspended in 0.5 mL of 0.8% (w/v) SeaKem Gold agarose (derived from Gelidium species of seaweed; Lonza Rockland, Inc., Rockland, MD, USA) prepared in Minimal Essential Medium plus 25 m/mol L HEPES buffer (Sigma\u2010Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The islet\u2010agarose suspension was expelled beneath the surface of sterile mineral oil (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) to produce four 0.125\u2010mL spherical beads of approximately 5\u20106 mm in diameter, each containing 500 IEQ. The 1st coat macrobeads were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. After 3\u20105 days, a second coat of 5% SeaKem Gold agarose was applied, giving each macrobead a final diameter of 8\u20109 mm. The determination of the average pore size of the agarose macrobeads is difficult at best, given the gelation mechanism of random polymer coils forming aggregated double helices, which results in pores of various diameters with ill\u2010defined walls. For this reason, the macrobead has not been considered to provide absolute viral sequestration although the encapsulated islets are protected from direct immune cell contact. Agarase, the enzyme necessary to break down agarose, is abundant in ocean\u2010dwelling bacteria but has not been found in mammals.19 The macrobeads, in the absence of trauma, remain intact indefinitely following implantation in the abdominal cavity.",

The encapsulation method supports islet viability over extended culture periods, which permits ample time for the conduct of numerous screening assays for the detection of specific viruses, electron microscopic detection of viral particles and/or cell damage, and the lengthy in vitro culture screens for both known and unknown viruses. This is a significant advance over the indirect testing of animals raised under gnotobiotic conditions and allows for screening at multiple points throughout the islet macrobead manufacturing process.

The ability of this program to ensure that the health status of donor animals is high and that islet macrobeads are consistently negative for bacterial or viral contamination is now firmly established. The safety program is open to continual review and refinement in consultation with relevant experts throughout the world. For example, the use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to provide an additional screen of islet macrobeads for known and unknown viruses and for other extraneous agents has been recently implemented as it is routinely applied in vaccine production, even though TEM has a considerably lower sensitivity compared to PCR. Any positive TEM findings will be investigated to identify known agents using immunohistochemistry or molecular techniques.

In fact, it is becoming increasing clear that only about 25% of porcine pancreases yield a sufficient number of islets for clinical use.18, 53, 54, 55 Given these limitations, our approach is to raise source animals in high hygienic environments, biopsy individual pancreases for islet isolation suitability and perform extensive microbiological screening of all selected donor animal tissues and the islet macrobeads themselves.",

            "text": "Our methodology, however, employs an alternative approach to the FDA\u2010recommended 21\u2010day quarantine period for individual donor animals that deserves some discussion. A minimum 7\u2010day quarantine period for animals used in the processing of biological products is also stated in 21 CFR part 600.56 The rationale for the quarantine period is to provide time for an acute infection to become clinically apparent.57 During a quarantine period, cohort animals would be housed in a HEPA\u2010filtered environment with strict husbandry practices designed to eliminate the introduction of adventitious agents, similar to a laboratory specific pathogen\u2010free (SPF) animal facility. Such animals would be monitored for the development of disease symptoms and undergo blood, fecal, and nasal swab sampling for microbiological status assessment. The development of disease symptoms or unsatisfactory diagnostic results in any animal would disqualify all animals in a given cohort from pancreas donation. This donor qualification process is most appropriate when there is not sufficient time to perform thorough screening of the islets to be transplanted, for example, when free islets are to be transplanted within a few days of isolation. The islets encapsulated in the agarose macrobeads, in contrast, survive for more than 1 year during in vitro culture13 allowing ample time to conduct the numerous and lengthy assays designed to detect both known and unknown microbiological agents. Assays that screen the islet product directly are more likely to detect a pathological agent than the assessment of the clinical condition of the donor which may not present disease symptoms (eg, PPV) or the detection of a latent virus (eg, PLHV) that might be readily observed in particular organs but not as reliably in peripheral blood cells.58 Thus, it is the islet macrobeads themselves, that is, the tissue to be implanted, that undergoes quarantine and it is the ability to thoroughly screen the islets using a wide variety of specific and non\u2010specific assays that obviates the need to raise or quarantine donor animals in HEPA\u2010filtered environments. As discussed by Schuurman in the first IXA consensus statement on source animals, \u201c\u2026it can be suggested that with longer time periods of islet cell culture the relevance of health status of the source pig becomes less, and that the focus of DPF status is more on the cultured cells.\u201d.59 This ideology is again reflected in the first update of the IXA consensus statements in relation to encapsulated islets allowing the time necessary for thorough microbial screening and the potential to move the safety criteria further toward the islets.44\n",

The use of aseptic techniques and standard operating procedures from the procurement of the pancreas through to the isolation and encapsulation of the islets ensures freedom from adventitious virus contamination. The microbiological safety program presented here screens numerous tissues from all pancreas donor and sentinel animals for more than 25 pathogens. When combined with the use of pre\u2010screened media and porcine serum, this approach controls major routes of introduction for adventitious agents that could enter the macrobead production process. This is the emphasis of Checkpoints 1 and 2. Monitoring the source herd provides information on potential breaks in biosecurity that may warrant additional testing or the temporary halting of macrobead production (Checkpoint 1). This is also true of individual donor animal screening and in this case may necessitate the discard of any macrobeads produced from suspect tissue (Checkpoint 2). Any positive viral findings in the macrobeads, with the exception of PERV, would automatically result in the destruction of those macrobeads (Checkpoint 3). Finally, patient monitoring under Checkpoint 4 provides not only valuable information for potential treatment options in the case of suspected pathogen transmission but also manufacturing decisions as well as feedback to Checkpoints 1\u20103 that may result in the modification of one or more checkpoints.",

The challenge we face is to understand those risks such that they can be minimized to an acceptable level in light of the expected clinical benefits. The potential risk of viral transfer from the transplanted cells to the recipient has been the major safety concern. To address this issue, a testing rationale was developed to screen sentinel and donor animals for viruses that are present in the herd, are of special interest such as known zoonotic agents, or are known to infect swine in the USA. An initial characterization of the PERV infectivity status of the source herd was not performed given the unlikely ability, at least at that time, to eliminate these endogenous retroviruses and the growing conclusion that the risk of PERV transmission to human xenotransplantation trial participants is low.60, 61, 62 Viruses excluded from screening, to date, are those that are not known to be present in the United States (eg, Japanese encephalitis virus), unlikely to be present in the source facility (eg, vesicular exanthema of swine virus), or unlikely to be found in the pancreas or to survive during extended macrobead culture (Porcine torovirus). Many of these same screening exclusion criteria can apply to other infectious agents (eg, Toxoplasma gondii is unlikely to be present in the biosecure source herd). This is similar to the rationale used for pathogen screening as reported by Wynyard et al for the Auckland Island strain of swine63 in which agents present or with an uncertain status in New Zealand, or the relevance in a biosecure facility or infectious potential post\u2010transplantation, or the ability of the agent to survive in the environment of the pancreas were used to develop a list of screened pathogens. This herd, which originated from animals isolated on a remote island south of New Zealand, may be considered DPF because they are routinely screened and documented to be free of specific infectious bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. Although the rationale behind the development of this pathogen list was similar to our approach, the applications of the screening programs differ. Ultimately, the New Zealand group tested the source animal colony for 15 viruses, 10 bacterial species, and one protozoa. A reduced number of pathogens were screened for in the donor piglets and islet preparations. The G\u00f6ttingen minipig herd in Ellegaard, Denmark, also qualifies as a DPF source animal facility as these animals have been shown to be free of at least 88 infectious agents including 20 viruses through PCR methodology. The one exception was the finding of swine Hepatitis E virus in 3 sow\u2010piglet pairs and in 3 animals under one year of age.52 These data suggest that in this case it may be possible to select donor animals based on the viral profile of individual animals.",

An even greater emphasis is placed on the qualification of the islet macrobeads (Checkpoint 3) in which an increased number of viruses are screened for using a variety of assays including specific PCR methods. Additionally, co\u2010culture and electron microscopy assays are employed to look for unknown viruses, which would then prompt efforts to identify the virus as either a known or unknown agent (eg, PRRSV inducing cpe in MA104 cells as one component of the islet macrobead screen). Also, as part of their release criteria, the islet macrobeads are confirmed to be sterile and free from mycoplasma and any significant level of endotoxin. Although the current paper reports porcine islet macrobead screening results for the previous 2 years, we have found no evidence for the presence of known or unknown transmissible viruses in the islet macrobeads during screening of porcine pancreatic islets isolated from 30 donor animals over the previous 5 years.

Encapsulating porcine islets using the agarose\u2010agarose method eliminates the need for immunosuppressive therapy, and a fully competent immune system is expected to significantly reduce the risk of xenozoonotic infection.80 Likewise, it is generally agreed that non\u2010genetically modified Source Animals reduce the risk of zoonotic infection because unmodified viral particles would be more likely to activate human complement\u2010mediated destruction.81, 82, 83 In our non\u2010immunosuppressed streptozotocin\u2010induced diabetic NHP surveillance, there has been no evidence of viral infection with PCV (Type 2), PLHV\u20101, 2 and 3, PRRSV, PCMV, or PERV in samples collected longitudinally post\u2010transplant.

This process allows the level of nucleic acid recovery in the presence of the test sample to be assessed, which ensures that low levels of RNA or DNA can be recovered. 2nd Step: Test samples contain viral target primers/probes, multiplexed with internal positive control (IPC) reagents during amplification. In a separate assay, test samples are spiked with target nucleic acid (viral RNA or DNA) at the detection limit. This process ensures any negative results are not caused by sample matrix interference of the qPCR assay.
