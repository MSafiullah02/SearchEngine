As of Wednesday, April 1, 2020, there were more than 911 308 cases and more than 45 000 deaths reported globally.4 Confirmed cases in the United States were at 206 207 with more than 4542 deaths.4 Statistical models predict that more than 260 000 hospital beds will be used in the United States by the end of April 2020.5 The impact of COVID-19 on our daily lives, work, families, and overall operations is unprecedented in modern times, and the situation continues to change on a day-to-day basis. In addition to constantly evolving information, there are misconceptions among the public about the pathology, etiology, transmission, treatment, and risks associated with COVID-19.",

Up to 25% of those infected are asymptomatic. This creates challenges to prevention efforts because these asymptomatic carriers are often unaware of their COVID-19 status. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people and those with underlying medical problems such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.3,7 Clinical presentation of severe cases of COVID-19 is characterized by hypoxia, dyspnea, and greater than 50% of lung involvement on imaging. In critical cases, people infected with COVID-19 will experience acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple-organ failure, shock, and death.8 At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19.9 The best way to prevent and slow transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes, and how it spreads.

In addition, there has been conjecture that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, ubiquitously used in cardiovascular patients, may increase a patient's susceptibility to the virus.16 However, currently, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association have recommended against preemptively stopping or starting an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in the setting of COVID-19.3,10,17 With more than 100 million Americans having some form of cardiovascular disease, there is an urgency to increase awareness among healthcare providers of the potential impact of COVID-19 in this high-risk population.",

            "text": "All aspects of healthcare delivery are affected by this pandemic.18 The sudden and rapid advancement of COVID-19 has created an unanticipated risk to healthcare providers. Beyond transmission and contraction of the disease, frontline healthcare providers are at a higher risk for experiencing anxiety, depression, and insomnia, due to burnout and compassion fatigue.8 The accelerating demands for hospital beds, personal protective equipment, and lifesaving apparatus such as ventilators and continuous renal replacement machines have introduced new financial burdens for otherwise high-resource health systems in the United States. Although there is close daily monitoring of the ongoing global battle against COVID-19, examination of this pandemic's impact on healthcare workers and healthcare delivery systems is warranted.18 Because of many states enforcing stay-at-home orders, healthcare providers are challenged with changing modes of practice for uncertain lengths of time. Healthcare settings across the nation are expeditiously transitioning from in-person to telehealth visits to retain access to healthcare for those with chronic conditions. Moreover, telehealth visits can be used to reduce visits to the emergency departments for non-urgent matters, a timely intervention to preserve emergency services for those with severe symptoms. If there is a silver lining, it may be the acceleration of the adoption of and expanded reimbursement for telehealth, broadening the reach and increasing the efficiency of chronic disease care.21 Efforts to sustain these care improvements will be critical after the rapid spread phase of the pandemic.",

It is unclear at this time how the COVID-19 will further impact the physical or mental health of individuals after recovery or overall health disparities among socially at-risk populations. As information about COVID-19 is rapidly evolving, it is imperative that healthcare providers reinforce the general prevention guidelines in addition to recommendations for persons with cardiovascular disease by the American Heart Association, Heart Failure Society of America, and American College of Cardiology.9",
