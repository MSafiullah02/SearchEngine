While indeed models for RILI may provide useful insight into COVID-19 disease progression, and successful treatments for radiation-induced lung injury may also be applicable to COVID-19-induced lung injury, this does not invalidate the hypothesis that low doses (< 100 cGy) of ionizing radiation may provide a beneficial anti-inflammatory effect in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. That the end points appear similar, does not imply the system would respond to the low dose of radiation as if it had already been irradiated to some much larger dose. Generally, RILI effects appear to have a threshold near 5 Gy, specifically V5 > 26% [1], and this dose level is far above the maximum doses LDRT would deliver. The efficacy of LDRT for viral pneumonia remains to be investigated in modern, randomized controlled studies, but the potential benefit is high and the risks are low.",
