Such information might not only shed light on the transmissibility and virulence of different strains of SARS-CoV but also on its presumed animal reservoir [4] . While it is internationally agreed that virus isolation from suspect SARS cases has to be performed under at least biosafety safety level (BSL) 3 conditions (WHO post-outbreak biosafety guidelines for handling of SARS-CoV specimens and cultures -18 December 2003: http://www.who.int/csr/ sars/biosafety2003_12_18/en/), it has to be stressed that during the outbreak that ended in July 2003, not a single laboratory infection seems to have occurred. In contrast, there have been several such incidents since; two without further human-to-human spread (Singapore, September 2003, and Taiwan, December 2003), and with spread beyond the laboratory workers themselves (Beijing, April 2004). Therefore, it is obviously not so much the routine diagnostic work-up of suspect SARS specimens that poses a risk to laboratory workers but the neglect of well-known precautions during scientific work which involves much higher volumes and concentrations of infectious materials. If possible, isolation of the causative agent should therefore always be attempted from suspect and probable SARS cases if suitable facilities are available. 132 Wolfgang Preiser et al. ",

SARS-CoV RNA has since been found in various clinical materials. Published papers describe its detection in respiratory secretions both from the lower and the upper respiratory tract, in stool, in urine, and in the blood, as well as in different tissues and organs. Subsequently developed PCR methods employ real-time formats and allow quantification of SARS-CoV RNA (Fig. 4 ). Using such a method, Drosten et al. [5] were able to demonstrate high concentrations of viral RNA of up to 10 8 molecules per ml in sputum samples; on the other hand, only low concentrations were detected in specimens from the upper respiratory tract, such as throat swabs, and in plasma during the acute phase of the illness. However, faecal specimens obtained late during convalescence, beyond the time period for which strict isolation of patients is usually recommended, tested positive. In patients from Hong Kong, Peiris et al. [8] found the amount of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV to peak around 10 days after onset of symptoms, at which time 19 of 20 patients were PCR positive in nasopharyngeal aspirates, all 20 in stool and 10 in urine samples.",
