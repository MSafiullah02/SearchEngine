            "text": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become an important public issue across the globe since December 2019. As of 12th of April 2020, more than 1.79 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories (Worldometer, 2020). It affects people worldwide and there is no vaccine yet for this virus. Certain types of pneumonia are implicated to the new coronavirus, which is considered a big threat to global public health. There is an urgent need to develop potent anti-COVID-19 agents for the prevention of the outbreak and stop viral infections. Repurposing of known small molecules seems to be very efficient way in order to develop potent drugs to combat coronavirus in this short time period. Recently, a number of efforts were made to design novel inhibitors or employ drug repurposing approach to identify anti-COVID-19 drugs, which can act as promising inhibitors against coronavirus protease (Khan et al., 2020; Sarma et al., 2020). The known coronavirus 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), also known as Mpro, is the main protease, which is required for proteolytic maturation of the corona virus. This Mpro have an essential role in the immune regulation and cleaving the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which making them attractive and important targets for anti-COVID-19 drugs (Zhou et al., 2019). Functional proteins such as RNA polymerase, endoribonuclease and exoribonuclease are generated by cleavage of pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins by Mpro (Khan et al., 2020). Therefore, targeting Mpro enzyme will inhibit the viral maturation and enhance the host innate immune response against COVID-19. 3D crystal structure of 3CL hydrolase from specific coronavirus (PDB ID: 6LU7) is recently reported in the public domain. This could be an excellent target to be used to screen small molecule libraries to inhibit the cleavage of the viral polyprotein and stop the spread of infection. In the Protein Data Bank (PDB) archive, there are also some proteins whose sequence identity at least 90% similar to the COVID-19 coronavirus 3CL hydrolase (Mpro). These proteins structures include bound inhibitors, which could lead to repurpose novel drug against coronavirus 3CL hydrolase. Recent study has shown that the cellular transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is used by COVID-19 for the purpose of entering the host cells, and blocking TMPRSS2 might offer a promising treatment option and prevent the virus from entering the host cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Transmembrane serine proteases are connected to some viral respiratory infections, where they facilitate the entry of the virus into the lungs (Shulla et al., 2011). TMPRSS2 belongs to the serine protease transmembrane family type II, and it was recognized by its involvement in the cleavage of the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein in epithelial cells (B\u00f6ttcher et al., 2006). In addition, studies have shown that TMPRSS2 can drive the cleavage spike protein, which is a coronavirus fusion glycoprotein. Spike proteins on the host cell surface are activated by TMPRSS2 to facilitate the virus cell-membrane fusion and the entry of the virus (Gierer et al., 2013; Matsuyama et al., 2010). Targeting TMPRSS2 in some animal studies decreased the pathological severity of influenza virus infection (Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019). Hence, TMPRSS2 is an attractive target for designing and developing antiviral drugs (Laporte & Naesens, 2017). Herein, our study aims to help in coronavirus inhibition in one of two ways, preventing the virus from entering the host cells, and blocking the virus maturation inside the host cells. Computer-aided drug design (CADD) has been used for the identification of potent inhibitors against coronavirus (Berry et al., 2015; Oany et al., 2014). In this study, we have applied virtual screening approach, homology modeling of human TMPRSS2 enzyme, molecular docking study and ADMET profile analysis in order to identify novel and potential inhibitors against COVID-19 (Figure 1).",

            "text": "Lack of information of crystal structures of particular proteins has delayed and obstructed the drug industry. Homology modeling is widely applied to create a reliable structure of a protein using its own amino acid sequence (Vyas et al., 2012). To date, TMPRSS2 enzyme structure has not been resolved yet. Therefore, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) search was carried out to identify the most suitable template for our target (TMPRSS2). According to the results, the crystal structure of human transmembrane protease serine (DESC1) showed high identity of 41%, 187 Bit-Score and 2.55333e-55 E-value with the query target. Consequently, the 3D structure of DESC1 was retrieved from PDB website (PDB ID: 2OQ5, 1.61 \u00c5) (Kyrieleis et al., 2007). TMPRSS2 sequence in FASTA file format (UniProt ID: O15393) was downloaded from UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/). The template and the target sequences were aligned using \u201cAlign Sequences\u201d in DS 4.5. Twenty models were created using \u201cHomology Modeling\u201d protocol in DS 4.5 using MODELLER plug-in (Webb & Sali, 2016). MODELLER was then used to verify the 20 built models. The best model was found to be M0001 with a Normalized DOPE score of \u22121.106201. The created homology modeling was then minimized using the \u201cClean Geometry\u201d tool provided by DS 4.5, which minimizes the energy under CHARMM forcefield. Additionally, the protein was prepared using \u201cPrepare Protein\u201d protocol and protonated at pH, 7.4. M0001 model was then refined using 3Drefine web server (http://sysbio.rnet.missouri.edu/3Drefine/) (Bhattacharya et al., 2016).",

To perform the virtual screening approach in our study, AutoDock Vina was used. AutoDock Vina offers an accurate and high performance docking tool, which relies on both empirical and knowledge-based scoring functions (Trott & Olson, 2009). The docking parameters for both Mpro and TMPRSS2 are given in Table 1. AutoDock Vina was used to assess the binding affinity of the native inhibitor (N3) obtained from the crystal structure of Mpro, as well as the binding affinity of selected known inhibitors of TMPRSS2 retrieved from the literature (Sielaff et al., 2011). The binding energy threshold was based on the average binding energy scores of docked known inhibitors against Mpro and TMPRSS2, which found to be \u22126.2 kcal/mol and \u22127.2 kcal/mol, respectively. In the present study, the threshold was set to \u22128 kcal/mol due to the fact that hit compounds were expected to show lower binding energy scores, and to narrow down the search space. Selection criterion was set to ensure that the virtual screening will end up only with those molecules with the highest binding affinities to their respective targets. A total of 3451 molecules satisfied our selection criterion (\u0394G\u00b0 \u2264 \u22128 kcal/mol) and showed the highest binding affinity against Mpro and TMPRSS2 enzymes, respectively.",

Sequence alignment for M0001 and the human DESC1were performed unsing DS 4.5, and the sequence identity was 39.4%, while sequence similarity was 61% (Figure 2). In fact, if the target and template sequences share 30% and more of amino acid identity, the homology modeling is considered to be reliable and successful (Xiang, 2006). Structural alignment of our homology modeling structure (target) with the 3 D structure of DESC1 (template) was performed using DS 4.5, and the calculated RMSD was 0.40 \u00c5, which suggests the high similarity between the target and the template (Figure 3). Our model (M0001) was verified using the Web-based version of Protein Structure Analysis tool, ProSA. ProSA is used to calculate the z-score of a specific model and correlate this score to those calculated scores from all publicly available structures on PDB website. Accordingly, the z-score of our model M0001 was -6.69, which is in the range of all PDB conformations (Figure 4a). Moreover, the energy plot describes amino acid position depending on its local energy, where negative values relate to the accuracy of the structure (Figure 4b). In addition, PROCHECK web-based tool was used to generate Ramachandran plot to assess the energetically allowed regions of our model (Figure 4c). 83.8% of the residues are in the most favored regions, 15.2% are in additional allowed regions and 1.0% of the residue are in disallowed regions. ERRAT (https://servicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/ERRAT/) was used to calculate the overall quality factor (OQF) for non-bonded atomic interactions, and generally any structure with OQF of 50% and more is considered as a high quality model. For our homology modeling, the overall quality factor calculated by the ERRAT server was 62% (Figure 5).",

Talampicillin was found to have a binding energy score of \u221211.17 kcal/mol and an inhibition constant of 6.49 nM. Talampicillin is a prodrug of ampicillin, an antibacterial drug with a high potency against gram-negative bacteria. Talampicillin formed conventional and carbon hydrogen bonds with residues Gly143, Glu166, Gln189 and Gln192, \u03c0-\u03c3 bond with His41, two alkyl interactions with the residues Met165 and Met49, two \u03c0-alkyl bonds with the residues Cys145 and Pro168, a \u03c0-stacked interaction with Leu167 and many van der Waals interactions were found as well (Figures 6a, 7a). Lurasidone was the second-best candidate inhibitor against Mpro that showed and estimated inhibition constant value of 6.52 nM with a predicted binding energy score of \u221211.17 kcal/mol. Lurasidone was approved by the FDA in 2010 as an antipsychotic drug for treating schizophrenia patients (Corponi et al., 2019). Different ligand-protein interactions formed after the molecular docking study with Lurasidone, which includes hydrogen bonds with the residues His41 and Glu166, alkyl interactions with Met165 and Met49, \u03c0-alkyl interaction with Pro168, Met165 and His41 and multiple van der Waals interactions with the receptor (Figures 6b and 7b). Talampicillin and Lurasidone showed a reliable binding mode in Mpro and blocking the active site of the enzyme. The two top-ranked compounds from the ZINC15 library were ZINC000015988935 and ZINC000103558522. ZINC000015988935 was found to have a binding energy of \u221212.39 kcal/mol and an inhibition constant of 826 pM, while ZINC000103558522 had a binding energy of -12.36 kcal/mol and an inhibition constant of 866 pM. ZINC000015988935 showed a \u03c0-sulfur interaction with Met49, seven H-bonds with the residues Arg188, Asp187, Gln189, Ser144, Cys145 and Glu166, alkyl interaction with Met165 and a \u03c0-alkyl interaction with Cys145 (Figures 6c and 7c). ZINC000103558522 shared two \u03c0-sulfur interactions with residues Met49 and Cys145, hydrogen bonds with Glu166, Gln189, Cys145, Ser144 and Gly143, alkyl interactions with Met165 and Met49 and lastly \u03c0-alkyl interactions with Cys145 and Met49 and various van der Waals interactions with the enzyme (Figures 6d and 7d). ZINC000015988935 and ZINC000103558522 depicted more hydrogen bond numbers shared with the enzyme in comparison to Talampicillin and Lurasidone, and this explains the higher binding affinity estimated for the Mpro enzyme (Figures 6 and 7).",

Root mean square deviation (RMSD) was calculated considering the proteins backbone with respect to the initial conformations. As depicted in Figure 10a, RMSD of free Mpro enzyme remained stable between 5 ns and 34 ns timescale at 2.4 \u00c5, then slightly increased and persisted at 3.6 \u00c5 from 35 ns till the end of the run. The RMSD of Mpro_ZINC000015988935 reached its steady state at 3.1 \u00c5 at 10 ns. The RMSD of Mpro_Talampicillin showed that the system was balanced after 5 ns and slightly fluctuated between 2.3 and 3 \u00c5 and displayed the greatest effect on Mpro\u2019s stability. As illustrated in Figure 10b, The RMSD curves of the free TMPRSS2 had reached the equilibrium state after 3 ns. The RMSD of compounds TMPRSS2_Rubitecan and TMPRSS2_ZINC000000702323 revealed that the two complexes had shown almost the same behavior during the MD simulation and achieved structural stability the last 15 ns. A thorough study of the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) curves of the free Mpro and its complexes showed all amino acids located in the active site of the enzyme had RMSF fluctuations between 0.8 \u00c5 and 1.7 \u00c5, which indicate that the studied compounds kept close contact with their binding pockets during the MD simulations. However, Mpro_ZINC000015988935 showed higher fluctuations for residues 43\u201345 and 187\u2013190 and this observation is consistent with the RMSD profiles of Mpro_ZINC000015988935 (Figure 11a). The higher fluctuations depicted in the RMSF profiles of TMPRSS2 and its complexes are located within the loop regions of the protein, and this is expected considering the high flexibility nature of loops (Figure 11b).",
