In particular, the following research question has been addressed: What factors predict the likelihood that respondents would report that they agree on conducting mass evacuation drills yearly? The approach has been the application of logistic regression technique to identify these factors. Of the 19 initial explanatory variables, in the final model, only seven variables and one interaction term, were significantly associated with the outcome variable; i.e.: age (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.366; 95% Confidence Interval (CI)=1.039-1.795); occupation (OR=3.378; CI=1.457-7.830); frequency of drills: one/year (OR=2.128; CI=1.610-2.812); knowledge vs. drills (OR=1.394; CI=1.172-1.658); 'perception vulnerability city' (OR=1.271; CI=1.091-1.480); warning time (OR=1.266; CI=1.1036-1.548); usefulness of the SASMEX (OR=.783; CI=.615-.998); and 'perception vulnerability city' by occupation interaction (OR=.786; CI=.643-.961). Further research may be needed to gain a better understanding of people's motivations on evacuation drills taking place anytime during the day or at night, and whether evacuation drills should be unannounced.",

Further, in 2004, the mayor of the city implemented the policy to conducting earthquake mass drills on 19 September yearly [17, 24, 25] . To conduct the drill, the warning is issued in a predefined date and time. Since then, there have been about twenty-two mass drills being conducted in the city. In particular, the following research question was addressed in the paper: What factors predict the likelihood that respondents would report that they agree on conducting mass earthquake drills yearly? The approach taken to the analysis has been the use of logistic regression technique.",

It is believed that since 2015, the mayor of the capital city decided to disseminate the seismic alert to the general public through a network of over twelve thousand loudspeakers distributed throughout the city [23] . Further, the existing policy for issuing the alert is the following: no alert is issued for earthquakes with M b <5.5 (M b = body-wave magnitude); relay a preventive alert if 5.5<= M b <6.0; and issue the alert when M b >= 6.0 [23, p.1453 ].",

Further, a question intended to measure respondents' degree of current knowledge on what actions to take during an earthquake was also included in the questionnaire; this variable was assessed on a scale ranging from 0-10 (0= \"Know Nothing\", 10= \"Know Everything\"). Finally, as mentioned in section 2, when conducting evacuation drills, the SASMEX (or any other EEW system) is an important element in this process; further, knowing the warning time is crucial in order to have a better response to earthquakes [26, 33] (warning time means the time between the moment the alarm goes-off and the actual ground shaking); an item regarding whether respondents knew the warning time once the alert is issued until the actual ground shaking was included in the questionnaire. The possible answers to the question were the following: 1= \"The time varies\", 2 = \"Other\" (i.e., \"2 min\", \"60 sec\"). As discussed in [26] , before the 2017 earthquakes, there was the general belief among the residents of the capital city that 60 sec. was the warning time before the ground shaking. However, this is the expected warning time if an earthquake is originated from the so-called \"Guerrero-gap\" along the Pacific coast of the country, but as mentioned in section 2.1, the 19 September earthquake epicentre was located inland and therefore the warning time was in fact zero.",

Three questions were included in this category. Respondents' were asked whether they have participated in drills before the year 2017 (1= \"Yes\", 2= \"No\").

Finally, respondents were asked the following question: Do you think that having a good knowledge on what to do during an earthquake, mass drillings are not necessary? The answer choices were 1= \"Yes\", 2= \"No\". This variable is denoted as 'Knowledge vs drills' as shown in Tables 1-3 .

Since 2004, mass drills have been conducted on 19 September every year in the capital city of the country. The aim of the present study was to address the following research question: What factors predict the likelihood that respondents would report that they agree on conducting mass evacuation drills yearly? Logistic regression was employed to identify these factors. First, we assessed the unadjusted relationships between the outcome and each potential predictor variable singly. Then, we adjusted these relationships for potential confounding effects. Finally, we considered the possibility of interaction effects between some of the variables. Of the 19 explanatory variables considered initially in the process of building the model (Table 3) Before discussing these findings, it is worth mentioning that in relation to the dependent variable, the results showed that 53.5% of respondents agreeing to conducting drills. It may be argued that this proportion may not be that high as one would have expected (i.e., 46.9% responded \"No\"). However, these findings are consistent with those reported in [7] [8] [9] [10] in the sense that earthquake drills are important in building a resilient community to seismic risk. For example, it is believed that more than 57 million people participated in drills across 56 countries and most of the US (this is according to the ShakeOut.org as cited in [20] ). Similarly, in New Zealand, in 2012 about 1.3 million people registered to participate in \"ShakeOut\" drill [20] . Further, by participating in drills, people will act if they believe that by doing this (i.e. drill participation) will increase their chance of survival and recovery; therefore, they will be more likely to undertake that action [20, 40, 41] . However, there is evidence that drill participation in some countries are low, for example, the 2005 evacuation drill participation in Japan was 19% [18] ; similarly, the participation rate in the 2014 evacuation drill that took place in the city of Ishinomaki (Japan) was only 7.3% [18] . The low participation is attributed, among other things, to embarrassment [20] , lack of motivation value of such drills [18] . It should be highlighted that we could not compare the lack of drill participation, if any, of the residents of the capital city because there is not available data. Similar studies on the effectiveness of evacuation drills should be investigated in the context of our case study.",

Also, in the report on the \"ShakeOut\" survey, in relation to school drill frequency, it has been found that 56% and 54% of school and district respondents, respectively, considered the need to conduct four or more drills per year [19, p.31] . Further research is needed to explain this difference; for example, by conducting a similar analysis in relation to the two questions that have not been addressed here, i.e., those related to whether respondents agree on conducting mass evacuation drills anytime during the day and night (see the Appendix).",

In general, the aim of an EEW system is to alert people by proving a few seconds/minutes to take some sort of action before the actual ground shaking [22, 23, 26] . The results showed that the variable warning time was significantly associated with the dependent variable. Respondents that considered the warning time varies were more likely to agree on conducting drills than those that responded \"Other\" (e.g., 50 sec., 2 min., etc.). This may be explained given the fact that during the 07 September 2017 earthquake, the warning was issued in time (i.e., about 2 min before the actual shaking). However, the 19 September earthquake (the earthquake that occurred twelve days after the first one), the warning was issued almost simultaneously with the ground shaking. Because of this, respondents may have perceived the need for drills in order to enhance their response capabilities during the emergency. Again, a detailed analysis of the performance of the SAMEX during the two earthquakes is presented in [26] . The importance of knowing the warning time before the shaking is consistent with similar studies [19, 20, 26, [39] [40] [41] [42] .",

These questions need to be addressed because of their implications in the way people may respond to the emergency [47] .
