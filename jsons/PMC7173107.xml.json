            "text": "The arenaviruses are enveloped bisegmented RNA viruses whose genome consists of two single-stranded RNA molecules (Buchmeier et al., 2001, Clegg et al., 2000). During biogenesis, arenaviral particles assemble and bud at the plasma membrane. The mature envelope glycoprotein complex of the arenavirus consists of three noncovalently associated subunits derived from the GP-C precursor by proteolytic cleavage events: a stable myristoylated 58 amino-acid signal peptide (SSP), the receptor-binding G1 subunit and the transmembrane G2 fusion protein (Buchmeier, 2002, Eichler et al., 2003, York et al., 2004). The initial cleavage to yield SSP is likely mediated by the cellular signal peptidase, and the mature G1 and G2 subunits are subsequently generated by the cellular SKI-1/S1P protease. Both cleavage events, as well as the presence of the myristoylated SSP subunit, are required for envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion (York et al., 2004). Entry of virion particles into host cells is initiated by G1 binding to cell surface receptors followed by endocytosis of the virion into smooth vesicles (Borrow and Oldstone, 1994). Although \u03b1-dystroglycan serves as a binding receptor for the Old World arenaviruses (Cao et al., 1998), the receptor utilized by the major New World group of arenaviruses is unknown (Spiropoulou et al., 2002). Membrane fusion is pH-dependent and is activated upon acidification of the maturing endosome (Borrow and Oldstone, 1994, Castilla et al., 1994, Di Simone and Buchmeier, 1995, Di Simone et al., 1994).",

            "text": "The molecular basis for envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion in the arenaviruses is largely unknown, however, sequence analysis of the G2 ectodomain of Lassa virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) has revealed two heptad-repeat regions that can be represented to form amphipathic helices (Gallaher et al., 2001). This sequence motif is found among the large group of viral envelope glycoproteins that promote membrane fusion through the formation of a fusion-active core structure comprising a stable bundle of six \u03b1-helices. These Class I fusion proteins include those of the retroviruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, filoviruses and coronaviruses. In these proteins, the six-helix bundle structure involves a central coiled coil, formed by N-terminal heptad-repeat regions of the trimeric fusion subunit ectodomain, surrounded by three anti-parallel helices of the C-terminal heptad repeats which bind to the conserved hydrophobic grooves on the coiled-coil surface. Formation of this thermodynamically favored six-helix bundle brings the viral and cell membranes into apposition and is thought to provide the driving energy to initiate membrane fusion (Earp et al., 2005, Eckert and Kim, 2001, Hughson, 1997, Weissenhorn et al., 1999 and references therein). In keeping with the proposal that the arenavirus G2 ectodomain might also form a fusion-active six-helix bundle, Gallaher and colleagues have shown that a synthetic peptide derived from the N-terminal heptad-repeat region of LCMV is able to assume \u03b1-helical content (Gallaher et al., 2001).",

            "text": "The amino acid sequences of the heptad repeats of New World and Old World arenaviruses were aligned to demonstrate the high degree of conservation within the family (Fig. 1A). One key consideration in assigning a register to the proposed helical coiled coil of the heptad repeats (i.e., positions a through g) was to maximize the degree of hydrophobicity at the interhelical a and d positions. Upon inspection of the aligned sequences, a unique register of a and d positions was apparent (Figs. 1A and B). The a and d positions of the proposed N-terminal helix consist of hydrophobic residues common to the central interface of a trimeric coiled coil (e.g., leucine, isoleucine, methionine and valine). Positions assumed to lie on the exterior face of the coiled coil (b, c and f positions) contain polar or charged residues. This pattern is repeated through the C-terminal heptad-repeat region and appears to end at the C-terminal-most d and a positions (K409 and D413, respectively). Hydrophilic residues at two a positions in the New World viruses (R392 and S399) are replaced by less polar amino acids in the Old World viruses (serine and alanine, respectively). The hydrophilic sidechains, if buried, may impart specificity to the process of coiled-coil folding at the expense of thermal stability (Ji et al., 2000, Lumb and Kim, 1995).",

Cleavage by signal peptidase and the SKI-1/S1P protease are incomplete upon recombinant expression such that two precursor glycoproteins (full-length GP-C and the G1\u2013G2 precursor lacking SSP) are observed. The glycoproteins isolated by immunoprecipitation of the wild-type envelope glycoprotein, and an SKI-1/S1P cleavage-site mutant (cd-JGPC; York et al., 2004), are illustrated in Fig. 2A (far left). The two precursor glycoproteins migrate with molecular weights of 65 kDa and 60 kDa, respectively. The mature G2 glycoprotein appears as a band of \u224835 kDa, whereas the heterogeneous smear of the G1 glycoprotein is difficult to discern. These bands are better resolved following deglycosylation using peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (Fig. 2B, far left).

The efficiency of SKI-1/S1P cleavage was defined as the ratio of PSL units in the sum of the G1 + G2 peaks relative to the total number in both GP-C and G1 + G2 peaks.

Because the absolute efficiency of cleavage varied between experiments, each experiment was normalized to the average extent of cleavage in the entire 19-member panel. This average ratio (16% and 24% in the two complete experiments shown here) was used to determine the relative degree of cleavage in each mutant, and these numbers were averaged to generate the values plotted.
