Animal challenge studies have shown protection for several vaccines;8, 9, 10, 11 however, clearly discriminating between binding antibodies, neutralising antibodies, and T-cell responses as the determinant of protection is not possible. Both humoral and cellular immunity probably play a substantial role in viral clearance and mitigation of human clinical disease. MERS coronavirus infection induces neutralising antibodies that persist for several years.12, 13, 14 Passive transfer of either monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal serum samples has the ability to lower viral loads and reduce pathology in the lungs of several animal models.14, 15, 16 However, the concentrations of MERS coronavirus neutralising antibodies do not always correlate with viral clearance, survival, or disease severity.12, 14, 17, 18 A study in Saudi Arabia showed that CD8 T-cell responses directly correlated with shorter stays in hospital intensive care units and lower viral load in the respiratory tract.14 Given the uncertainty in defining a correlate of protection, a vaccine candidate that generates both humoral and cellular immune responses is desirable.",

Participants in this population were grouped according to their original treatment assignment. S1-ELISA, full-length S-ELISA, and EMC-2012 Vero neutralisation assay results are reported as geometric mean endpoint titres with 95% CIs for each dose-group at each timepoint. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare values by dose at each timepoint. Fisher's exact test was used to compare S1 ELISA response rates by group. Two-sided t tests were used to compare mean IFN-\u03b3-ELISPOT values between groups. Intracellular cytokine staining data are reported as the mean frequency with 95% CI of MERS coronavirus S-peptide-stimulated cytokine responses in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Statistical significance was defined as a two-sided p-value of less than 0\u00b705 and were nominal as we did not adjust for multiple comparisons. Differences between acute and convalescent samples from natural MERS coronavirus infections and week 14 GLS-5300 samples were assessed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison. We used GraphPad Prism statistical software (v.7) for analyses. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT02670187).",

S1-ELISA binding antibody seroconversion and T-cell responses were rapid. Vaccine induced immune responses were durable, as most participants maintained detectable S1 binding antibodies and had cellular immune responses at almost 1 year after the last vaccination. The vaccine-induced antibody and cellular immune responses were similar to those in the convalescent phase from samples in patients who recovered from natural MERS coronavirus infection. Finally, GLS-5300 vaccination induced polyfunctional CD8+ T-cell responses that have been shown to correlate with less severe disease and lower MERS coronavirus shedding.14 Immune responses to GLS-5300 were dose-independent across a nearly 10-fold dose range (0\u00b767 mg to 6 mg per vaccination) suggesting further dose reductions might be possible. A lower dose could extend the vaccine supply in an outbreak situation.",

Additional studies are required to test the efficacy of GLS-5300 in a region endemic for MERS coronavirus. A phase 2 trial is being planned to assess GLS-5300 in the Middle East and South Korea, areas which have been most affected by MERS coronavirus infection. A general decrease in the number of cases of MERS in the Middle East will make future placebo-controlled trials challenging. However, the global public health community should maintain interest in the development of a vaccine that is safe and effective to control any potential future outbreaks.",
