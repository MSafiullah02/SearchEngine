The causative agent was later determined to be a novel strain of coronavirus, virus SARS-CoV-2. The disease was later named COVID-19. By mid-January, the first case outside of China was reported. Rapidly rising cases prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health emergency of international concern at the end of January 2020 and declare the disease a pandemic by March 11, 2020. 1 The USA reported its first case on January 20, 2020 2 and currently has the highest number of diagnosed cases worldwide with over half a million cases by mid-April. 3 The COVID pandemic has impacted every facet of the government and society, including first and foremost our health care system. While immediate devastating impacts of this pandemic are apparent, secondary consequences are those related to obstacles placed upon resident education, including neurosurgery. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of the pandemic on neurosurgical education and discuss some preliminary ways in which neurosurgical education can cope with these challenges.",

In an effort to face this crisis, health-care institutions have While replacing hands-on clinical experience is not possible, certain steps can be taken to cope with these challenges. Although elective surgical interventions have been cancelled, there is a subset of patients that require urgent operative care in certain instances such as progressive neurological decline. Our institution, as well as others, have implemented a scoring system to determine the necessity and urgency of surgeries. 6, 7 That, along with an ongoing surveillance of hospital resources and disease spread, it is still possible to conduct surgeries that cannot be postponed beyond certain time frames. Furthermore, while clinic experience has suffered, partly because of patients' reluctancy to visit a health-care institution, current technology can compensate and bridge this gap. Alternatives include phone visits and tele-medicine including video calls. While these do not offer the same experience as traditional visits, it still allows residents the opportunity to evaluate patients, review imaging, form a differential diagnosis and a plan. The residents can also continue to conduct post-operative patient care. Furthermore, telemedicine is being utilized in healthcare (i.e. stroke telemedicine) on a routine basis for certain pathologies, and resident experience with telemedicine provides an educational opportunity to participate in an advancing field. 8",

            "text": "implemented a series of interventions. Those are largely directed to preserve resources such as PPE, re-arranging staff (including residents) to maximize efficiency and minimize exposure risk, and creation of COVID specific intensive care units (ICU). This translated into the decision to cancel neurosurgical elective cases. Furthermore, non-emergent surgical consultations have witnessed a decrease, likely due to decreases in the number of patients visiting the emergency departments for chronic complaints. Lastly, outpatient clinics have also experienced a decrease, albeit not as prominent, in the number of patients seen. Surgical residents have long reaped the learning benefits of all prior mentioned aspects of training. Basic non-operative skills such as performing physical examinations, dealing with consultations and managing the ward/ICU have been negatively impacted by such changes. More evidently, the large drop in the number of cases invariably witnessed by all programs due to elective surgeries cancellations takes a toll on resident technical training. This decrease in operative intervention affects not only the technical training of surgical residents, but also the post-operative management experience that comes with elective surgeries.",

Additionally, impacting resident education was the cancellation of the SNS 2020 Junior Resident Courses and the postponement of the American Board of Neurological Surgery (ABNS) Annual Primary Examination on March 12 th , 2020. Globally, the World Federation of Neurological Societies has also endorsed cancellation of worldwide meetings until at least July 31 st , 2020. In the modern era, medical training has profoundly benefited from eLearning opportunities. Neurosurgical training is no different as there are numerous online training tools to advance residents understanding of neurosurgery through anatomy resources, case illustrations, operative videos, and a wide breadth of peer reviewed publications. The educational hurdles placed by the COVID pandemic has emphasized the importance of online educational tools by allowing continued learning without increasing exposure risks. The AANS and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) have long shown an intense dedication to the education of its resident population. In coordination, they have opened access to online lecture series, virtual visiting professor conferences, and created COVID information hubs.",
