In practice, this means teaching students the critical components of health literacy, such that they understand the determinants of health and have the skills to take remedial action when necessary. However, little, if any recognition, has been given to this type of teaching in Brunei's schools, and this lack appears to be one of the main impediments to bringing about the type of curriculum change necessary to accomplish a critical level of health literacy. Also, as Gould, Mogford, and DeVoght (2010) remind us, health educationalists and professionals themselves need to be educated.",

            "text": "Brunei has adopted, as its guiding national philosophy, Melayu Islam Beraja, or MIB (Malay Islamic Monarchy). Education strategies are guided by the culture and traditions inherent in this philosophy (Charleston, 1998) . Much of Brunei's educational provision emphasizes cognitive outcomes rather than affective and competency-based ones. For example, a study funded by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS found that education systems in some countries, including Brunei, employ HIV/AIDS-related education that is largely informationbound. Sex education is conducted in a mechanistic way, focusing mainly on human reproduction and anatomy (Smith et al., 2003) . The study also found that when education programs cater to the cultural sensitivities of the majority of the population, the effectiveness of those programs can be compromised because they do not address certain health issues, often because of inherent gender bias. From her study of Bruneian health textbooks, Elgar (2004) found that the gender bias evident in them meant concealment of issues affecting women's health. Hinyard and Kreuter (2006) suggest that because oral story-telling plays a significant role in Malay culture, it could be used to promote positive health behavior. Cheong and Thong (2004) have done just this with respect to promoting pro-environmental attitudes in Brunei. Also, because Muslims in Brunei adhere strictly to the teachings of the Quran, passages from it could be used to promote healthy lifestyles, such as this one: O Children of Adam! Wear your beautiful apparel At every time and place Of prayer: eat and drink: But waste not by excess, For Allah loveth not the wasters. (al-A'r f:31) ('Al , 1989) Reference could also be made to passages in Hadith, which records the traditions or sayings of the Prophet Muhammad. An example is this excerpt, which refers to eating and drinking in moderation.",

Better ways of communicating information are needed. Information and communication technologies (ICT) have the potential to deliver, at low cost, programs aimed at changing people's health-related behaviors. They are particularly likely to appeal to students from the \"digital generation.\" Ferney and Marshall (2006) identify the utility of websites that include simple interactive features, such as online community noticeboards, personalized progress charts, email access to expert advice, and access to information on specific local physical activity facilities and services. The online social networks that have become particularly popular amongst young people in recent years could provide an especially valuable means of imparting health education. CONCLUSION If Brunei is to achieve its aspiration of bringing about a high quality of life for all of its people, much greater effort than that currently being exercised is needed, especially with respect to people's health. Better health education within both schools and the wider community is a key to realizing this aim. There is a need to change behaviors and convert problems to solutions instead of just focusing on improving knowledge and attitudes. There is also a need to implement in health education programs attitudes and practices learned from research, especially those that take a holistic approach to health and health education. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach to education and health and empowering the young to act in ways that exemplify healthy living are essential.",

Brunei takes pride in the many jungle walking trails available to its residents.
