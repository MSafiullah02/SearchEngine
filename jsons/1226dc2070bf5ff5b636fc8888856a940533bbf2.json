It is believed that infectivity starts before the symptoms and it significantly decreases 7 days after the onset of symptoms. It is reported that the infectivity period depends on the severity and the stage of the infection of the patient. This virus can survive on nonliving surfaces in 22-25 \u00b0C and 40-50% relative humidity for up to 5 days and this increases the risk of infection. Aerosol transmission is also possible [2] . In a study, it has been shown that the virus can remain alive in the aerosol for up to 3 h after aerosol generating procedures and could be detected [3] .",

It is emphasized that the reason for this high rate of infection among HCP stems from shifts that last more than 10 h a day due to the large number of patients and serious staff shortages. Furthermore, excessive fatigue and stress weaken the immune system and therefore, increase the sensitivity to COVID-19. As the infection widened rapidly, it is reported that there has been a rapid decrease in the availability of PPE, and a rapid increase in infection in HCP that resulted in a higher rate of transmission among visitors, personnel, and patients [4] .",
