Thereafter we discuss the links between labor migration and disease, particularly focusing on southern Africa, and examine the different levels at which labor migration can cause health vulnerability. We then present two case studies that further explore the complex association between migrant labor and health vulnerability: the relationship between migration and tuberculosis (TB) in Norway, and the role of labor migration in the explosive spread of HIV/AIDS throughout South Africa. We conclude by making recommendations for effective interventions on the local, national, and regional scales.",

Factors driving this migration include better training opportunities, higher income and efforts by countries in the developed world to fill vacant positions in their own health care systems (Bala, 2005; Chaguturu & Vallabhaneni, 2005; Krosnar, 2004) . The loss of health care workers leaves crippling gaps in health care systems of developing countries already struggling to combat mounting health crises, such as TB and AIDS (Schubert, 2003) .",

Labor migration emerges from and creates systems of economic inequality, political oppression, marginalization, and social fragmentation, all of which can render migrants at greater risk of sexual coercion, unhealthy working and living conditions, and exploitation and violence. Women, in particular, are at risk, and in many countries appear to comprise the majority of informal, trans-border traders. Although migration provides opportunities for women's economic empowerment, it can also render them socially and economically vulnerable, and consequently at risk for contracting STIs (Ybanez, 1999a) . Some female traders, such as those crossing the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, may be coerced into sex to obtain passage from customs officials at border crossings (Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, 1999; Severino & de Moya, 1999; Wilson, 2001) . Female migrant farm laborers often cannot report sexual abuse, sexual coercion, and rape on commercial farms for fear of losing their jobs (Crush, Mather, Mathebula, Lincoln, Maririke, & Ulicki, 2000) .",

            "text": "Several studies have linked the early spread of HIV in Southern Africa to migrant laborers working on construction projects, highlighting the health risks faced by another sector of migrant laborers. For example, a 1992 study on the Katse Dam Project in Lesotho reported that 5.3% of construction workers were infected with HIV, compared with 0.8% prevalence in mountain villages of the region. A 2001 report found approximately 160 sex workers, daily, around a more recent dam construction site in Mohale (Wilson, 2001) . In Malawi, too, road construction projects have been associated with the spread of HIV (IOM, 2003) . Commercial fishermen can also work for extended periods away from their communities, families, and regular partners. These workers often frequent and support alcohol and commercial sex industries in fishing ports, rendering them susceptible to STI contraction (Samnang, Leng, Kim, Canchola, Moss, Mandel, & Page-Shafer, 2004) . For example, fishermen in Sihanouk Ville, a port and fishing area in Cambodia, have an overall HIV prevalence of 16.1%, more than twice that of the general Khmer population (Samnang et al., 2004) . In Uganda, the first cases of AIDS were identified in 1985 in fishing villages along the shores of Lake Victoria. Sexual networking was investigated in one Ugandan fishing village in order to better understand HIV infection dynamic (Pickering, Okongo, Bwanika, Nnalusiba, & Whitworth, 1997) . Pickering and associates found that casual, paying partners accounted for 42% of sexual contacts among married women and 80-100% of sexual contacts among single women. Finally, the conditions of migrant labor can affect the health of children of migrant laborers. While remittances from migrant workers can increase familial resources and improve children's access to education, better living conditions, and health services, the familial fragmentation caused by absent parents may have detrimental affects on child health, especially in situations where extended families cannot mitigate the impact of absent parents (Collinson, Lurie, Kahn, Wolff, Johnson, & Tollman, forthcoming; Kanaiaupuni & Donato, 1999) .",

TB incidence rose significantly in Norway from 4.7/100,000 in 1997 to 6.6/100,000 in 2001. Genetic studies have allowed researchers to track the course of TB incidence and transmission. One such study found that foreign-borne patients account for an increasing proportion of new TB cases in Norway: more than 70% of TB patients between 1999 and 2001 were found to be of foreign origin, compared to 53% of cases between 1994 and 1998. Most of these cases were reactivations of latent infections that occurred before arriving in Norway . A similar DNA fingerprinting study in Denmark found that Somalian immigrants accounted for a high percentage of TB cases between 1992 and 1999, and that 74.9% of these cases were most likely infected before their arrival. This research indicates that migrants with latent TB infections account for an increasing proportion of TB cases in both Denmark and Norway, and a similar trend might be expected in other Western European countries, too, as migration from high-prevalence countries continues to increase.",

Further, most outbreaks of TB within Norway were found to be of Norwegian origin, from strains that had been in Norway for many years . Similarly, in Denmark, although a large percentage of TB patients were Somali, only .9% of Danish TB patients were probably infected by Somalis (Lillebaek, Andersen, Bauer, Dirksen, Glismann, de Haas, & Kok-Jensen, 2001 ).

Given that transmission of TB from migrants to native Norwegians accounts for such a small proportion of new cases, regulations that limit migration and the rights of migrants would hardly provide greater protection. On the contrary, such policies could further marginalize migrants and make it more difficult for them to access the care they need, thus increasing the probability that those with latent infections will develop active and infectious TB. Even if migrants were more likely to transmit TB, ensuring that entering migrants received high quality health care and TB treatment would most effectively prevent further disease transmission. While the role of migrant movement in introducing infectious diseases to new areas has been extensively documented, this case illustrates that the trajectory of transmission facilitated by migration is not necessarily straightforward, and may depend on numerous complex factors. Why did increasing numbers of TB-positive migrant workers entering Norway not lead to TB outbreaks there? Why does labor migration fuel infectious disease epidemics and other health crises in other contexts? To answer these questions, we must look deeply at the structures of migrant labor systems, and the conditions in which migrant laborers work, live, and move between communities.",

Large-scale migration to industries in South Africa is a regional issue with far-reaching consequences. Migration patterns in South Africa were an integral part of the way in which government, with the support of industry (in particular the mining industry), structured South African society from early in the 20 th century. This \"social engineering\" culminated in the system of apartheid, which was formalized in 1948. During the early decades of the 20 th century, the movement of labor was strictly controlled so as to ensure a continuing supply of cheap black workers for agriculture, industry and commerce (Wilson, 1972) while simultaneously protecting the relative privilege of white workers (Lurie, 1992) . The demise of apartheid and the rise of democracy has already changed the pressures and demands for labor, and it is still not clear precisely what form and patterns labor migration will take in the new South Africa.",

Over the next 40 years, however, remittances from family members working in urban areas increased in importance. By 1970, agricultural production in these rural areas had declined to the point where only 10% of the total income for most rural households came from agriculture, with the remainder coming from remittances by family members employed as migrant laborers. In KwaZulu/Natal, for example, by the late 1980s, remittances from migrant workers made up over three-quarters of rural household income (May, 1990) .",

In 1936, for example, the chance that by the time a migrant was 45 years old, he would have ceased to engage in migrant labor was greater than 75% (Natrass, 1976) . Today, migrant labor tends to be a more long-term phenomenon, with more frequent trips home. Several factors have combined in recent years to encourage easier and more rapid movement of people in South Africa. These include the lifting of apartheid laws that restricted the movement of the majority of the population, the development of a significant transportation infrastructure, and the negotiation of more flexible work contracts resulting from strengthened trade unions. All of these events have made it easier for people to become migrants, and for migrants to return home more frequently than they could in the past.",

Additionally, women whose partners were migrants were as likely to be HIV-infected compared to women whose partners were not migrants, suggesting that rural transmission is playing a large role in the spread of HIV as well (Lurie et al., 2003a) . The study raises questions about the sexual networks of rural women, and challenges the common assumption of unidirectionality of HIV transmission in the context of large-scale population mobility. This finding highlights the importance of understanding the rural, as well as the urban, dynamics of the epidemic, and implies that successful prevention efforts should concentrate not only on the urban 'receiving' areas but on the rural 'sending' areas as well.",

It is likely that early in the epidemic, the role of migration was critical in disseminating of the virus from urban to rural areas, and that this role was relatively more important compared to that during the more mature stage of the epidemic (Coffee, Garnett, & Lurie, 2000) . Nevertheless, migration still appears to be an independent risk factor for men at a mature stage in the epidemic, even against the background of extremely high HIV prevalence. This highlights the importance of migration as one explanation for the size and rapidity of spread of the southern African AIDS epidemic, during all of its stages.",

Assessing the health impact of migration in other industries and other regions is critically important; the impact of migration on disease risk and transmission is likely to be different under different migratory, social, cultural, economic and political conditions. Understanding the mechanisms behind the spread of disease through migration is an essential step toward addressing and preventing these adverse health consequences. While smallscale interventions can confront local health concerns, their effectiveness is limited, given the national and regional nature of migration.",

Workplace interventions are likely to grow in importance, particularly in Southern Africa where mining companies are taking the lead in delivering effective antiretroviral therapy to HIVinfected workers. Indeed, in some work settings, industry's need for a healthy workforce has stimulated the growth of company-run health clinics, which are often better staffed and equipped than clinics in the public sector. Unfortunately, well-designed evaluations aimed at measuring the impact of such workplace programs have been few and far between.",

Within this context, these associations played a crucial role in encouraging sick, marginalized migrant laborers to seek out the medical care they needed (Guthmann et al., 1997) .

If not carefully designed to promote the health of migrants and the health of the communities they move between, migration policies can have detrimental health effects by marginalizing migrants from the health and social support services they need (Duckett, 2001) . A potent example of this is the U.S. internment of HIV-positive Haitian refugees in Guantanamo Bay. Following a violent 1991 coup in Haiti, 34,000 Haitian refugees were denied asylum in the U.S., most of whom were interned at Guantanomo Bay and subjected to mandatory HIV testing (Farmer, 2005) . Two-hundred and sixty-eight HIV-positive Haitians were put in an \"HIV detention camp,\" where detainees reported that they were confined to cramped barbed wire enclosures, forced to eat food with maggots, and beaten when they demonstrated to demand better living conditions. Judge Sterling Johnson, who ruled on the case in 1993, called the conditions of HIV-positive detainees \"cruel and unusual punishment\" (Farmer, 2005) .",

If the chain of disease transmission is to be broken, interventions must be aimed at people both in the areas sending and receiving labor. A successful case of a small-scale intervention that addresses the problematic social structures associated with disease transmission is that of the Lonmin Platinum mine in Rustenburg, South Africa. This mine has started to replace single-sex hostels with more family-friendly housing, a move that could greatly reduce risk-related behaviors caused by the separation of migrants from their families. Mathematical models show that eliminating single-sex mine hostels would be cost-effective and could have a substantial impact on HIV transmission (Gebrekristos, Resch, Zuma, & Lurie, 2005) . Today, more than 90% of mine workers still live in single-sex hostels.",

These deeper socio-economic transformations will require considerable resources, time, and political will to affect, and their greatest results will be long-term (Sweat & Denison, 1995) .
