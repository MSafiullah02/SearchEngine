This dimensionless quantity is defined as the average number of new infections caused by each infected person. In the case of SARS-COV2 outbreak in Sao Paulo this number is estimated to be between 2-6, if no social distancing measures are taken and the epidemics is left to follow its natural course. The infection rate (R 0 ) is the parameter that controls the number of new infections in a certain moment given the number of infected people in the days before. The assumption that the new number of cases is completely determined by the product between R 0 and the current number of infections implies directly that the epidemics curve will be an exponential whenever R 0 > 1. As R 0 increases, the steepness of the exponential also increases. The infection rate parameter R 0 can be reduced by adopting measures of social distancing and quarantine [1, 2] . A decrease in the social interaction rate and hygiene measures have the potential to strongly decrease R 0 reducing the steepness of the exponential curve and flattening the infection curve. For R 0 \u2264 1 the infection curve becomes flat and the epidemics is controlled.",

This probability was taken as a Gaussian distribution centered in a distance backwards from day n equal to the incubation time (\u03c4 inc ) with a given width (w).

This relation is of great interest since it would allow to predict how far we are from the peak. In principle there is no way to determine this parameter other than by a measurement of the real total number of cases in a certain time. This is virtually impossible, since it would require testing all the population. The determination of the true number of infections requires a precise measurement of the undocumented factor which is not easy since it depends on particular characteristics of the testing methodology in each particular country. On the other hand, random surveys of the type performed in elections could, in principle, give a good idea of this parameter. Random surveys performed in selected samples of the population allow to determine the percentage of the population which has already been in contact with the virus, providing and estimation the T n factor which, by its turn, would give an idea of the position in the epidemic time.

Changes in R 0 due to relaxation in the social distance measures can modify this prediction however the all curves have been calculated with the same parameter but normalized by different constants and shifted in time by different amounts. This corresponds to assume different total population in the sample. We see that all curves are consistent with the data but give different predictions for the position of the peak indicating that it is trivial to predict when the maximum of infection with be attained [5] . Different total populations can modify the peak position. Another important factor that has to be taken into account is the delay in the reporting time. there are indication the, in Brazil, the reported data can be delayed by up to 14 days implying that the real position in the curve should be shifted to the right by this amount of time.",

The result of our calculations show there have been 3 moments in this epidemics in Brazil so far, with different R 0 factors R 0 = 3.5; 1.9 and 1.4. In Sao Paulo the infection curve is following a little smaller R 0 = 1.3 value. The observed reduction of R 0 was probably induced by the quarantine and social distancing measures and eventually lock-down adopted by State governments. It became clear that the social distancing politics is essential to reduce the total number of cases and to control the epidemics. The total number of infections drops from 97% down to 51% as the infection rate falls from R 0 = 3.5 to for R 0 = 1.4. We show that, at the peak of the contamination curve, about 64% of the total contamination has been reached and 14 days after the peak about 88% of the total contamination took place suggesting the healing time as a possible criteria to start relaxing social distance measures.",
