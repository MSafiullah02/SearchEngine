The estimation of its value with respect to the key threshold of 1.0 is a measure of the need, and eventually effectiveness, of interventions imposed in various countries. Here we present an online tool for the data driven inference and quantification of uncertainties for R 0 as well as the time points of interventions for 51 European countries. The study relies on the Bayesian calibration of the simple and well established SIR model with data from reported daily infections. The model is able to fit the data for most countries without individual tuning of parameters. We deploy an open source Bayesian inference framework and efficient sampling algorithms to present a publicly available GUI cse-lab.ethz.ch/coronavirus that allows the user to assess custom data and compare predictions for pairs of European countries. The results provide a ranking based on the rate of the disease's spread suggesting a metric for the effectiveness of social distancing measures. They also serve to demonstrate how geographic proximity and related times of interventions can lead to similarities in the progression of the epidemic.",

There is a broad range of data analysis tools and forecasting models that have been deployed since the beginning of 2020 to assess the spread of the disease as well as the expected number of infections and numbers of deaths [1, 2, 3] . A metric that is often deployed to quantify the progress of the disease is the reproduction number (R0). While R0 exhibits significant complexity [4] , it is broadly considered that values of R0 above 1.0 indicate a rapid expansion of the infections. Governments have resorted to impose social distancing measures to reduce this number well below 1.0. The estimation of R0 hinges on the forecasting model and the data used to infer their parameters. Moreover, an often overlooked fact is that, the method by which inference is performed also plays a role on these estimates. A well established technique for such inference is Bayesian inference [5] . However, even though Bayesian inference is a very potent method to estimate uncertainties in model structure and parameters, model parameters may be unidentifiable for the chosen type and amount of data as well as the choice of priors [6, 7] .",

The study relies on the Bayesian calibration of the simple, and well established SIR model [8] , extended to account for interventions, with data from reported daily infections. We present an online interface that allows for entry of customized data and comparisons between countries. The parameters of the model include the reproduction number, the day of the first intervention and a reduction factor for the reproduction number. By inferring these parameters from data, we identify when interventions become effective and determine the reproduction number before and after the measures have become effective. This indicates how well the imposed restrictions are able to slow down the spread of the disease.",

We note that in the present work we apply our model to 51 European countries. Our model is able to fit the data for the majority of the countries without individual tuning of the parameters or the inference method for each country. We note that our results are in excellent agreement with the work previously mentioned [9] for Germany. Moreover our results indicate that capturing accurately the results for one country does not generalize well with the same accuracy to all countries. We visualize the inferred quantities on a map and rank the countries by the disease's spread rate and the effectiveness of the interventions. We find that the results of our model are consistent with those from related studies in Switzerland [10] . The results suggest that at the current stage of the pandemic, countries can be categorized according to the inferred R0. Most countries have imposed their restric-tions within the first weeks of the epidemics starting March 2020, and since then about 80% of them have managed to bring their country specific R0 below 1 which indicates a decaying epidemic. Other countries, such as Poland, Sweden and Moldova, remain at a stage with larger R0.",

The accuracy of the Bayesian inference can be improved by increasing the number of samples used by the solver.

The back-end code of our model evaluation is implemented in the Python, while performance critical parts are implemented in C++. The mean and confidence interval of the computed prediction for total and new daily infected cases are displayed together with input data. The inferred intervention date, tint, is highlighted by the vertical line with corresponding reproduction number before and after the intervention. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of our online interface comparing the predictions for Switzerland and Sweden.

They also performed Bayesian inference of the model parameters applied to Germany. That model has more parameters to describe multiple interventions and considers a periodic modulation of the daily reported cases to account for trends such as under-reporting on the weekends. We compare our results to this study in Fig. 4 where the reported quantities are the effective growth rate \u03bb * (t) = \u03b3(R0(t) \u2212 1), the number of new daily cases and the total number of cases. The effective growth rate relates to one limiting case of the SIR model where the total number of infected individuals is small compared to the population such that S/N \u2192 1 and the model reduces to an exponential growth I(t) \u221d exp(\u03bb * t), which is valid at early stages of the epidemic. Fig. 5 shows the corresponding parameters drawn from the posterior distribution. We want to highlight that our model is simpler and has fewer parameters than the one suggested in [9] . Also we observe that the fitted model agrees well with the reported data and provides an estimate for the intervention time for Germany. 3 .

The inferred reproduction number before and after intervention is shown in Fig. 2 . The map and the scatter plot reveal the differences in the values of R0 and effects of interventions among various countries. Certain countries show strong similarity in the inferred parameters. For example, the neighboring Switzerland and Austria both have R0 dropping from 2.3 to 0.7 after interventions, even though the latter imposed more constraining measures. The same is evident for other pairs such as Italy and France and also Poland and Ukraine. However, no single explanation for these similarities and differences can be suggested. Physical proximity of the countries does not always lead to similar progression of the epidemic. One example is Poland where the epidemic has started slower but the imposed restrictions have proved less efficient than in adjacent Lithuania. The disease's development depends on the types of measures taken by the governments as well as the demographics and the particular features of the social interactions in the population. For instance, the UK and Sweden initially decided against imposing strict measures and therefore undergo a longer epidemic with more infections than their neighbors, Ireland and Norway, which corresponds to larger inferred values of R0. Another inferred parameter is the intervention time. Figure 3 shows the relation between the reproduction number and the intervention time measured from the beginning of the epidemic in each country. One trend is apparent from the values of R0 before intervention: countries with larger initial R0 tend to introduce the restrictions earlier.",
