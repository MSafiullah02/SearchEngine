Objective: We sought to determine whether maternal asthma is associated with higher odds of infant respiratory tract infection with rhinovirus versus RSV and increased infection severity. Methods: Mother-infant dyads were enrolled from 2004-2008 during an infant respiratory tract infection (104 with rhinovirus and 279 with RSV). Mothers were classified into mutually exclusive groups (atopic asthma, nonatopic asthma, and no asthma). We determined viral cause using PCR and the severity of the infant's respiratory tract infection using the bronchiolitis severity score. Adjusted relative odds of maternal asthma with viral cause were calculated by using logistic regression. Proportional odds models assessed the association of maternal asthma and infant infection severity. Results: Infants with a mother with atopic asthma compared with infants whose mothers did not have asthma were more likely to have rhinovirus versus RSV infection (adjusted odds ratio, 2.42; 95% CI, 1. 19-4.90). Similarly, among infants with rhinovirus, having a mother with atopic asthma was associated with increased infection severity (adjusted odds ratio, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.21-7.98). This relationship was not seen among infants with RSV.",

Having a mother with atopic asthma was associated with increased severity of infant rhinovirus but not RSV infections. Infants with rhinovirus were more likely to have a familial atopic predisposition, which might partly explain the subsequent increased asthma risk. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2012;129:1236-42.) ",

            "text": "Bronchiolitis, a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and less commonly by human rhinovirus (HRV), affects an estimated 20% to 30% of children in the first year of life and is a leading cause of hospitalization during infancy. [1] [2] [3] [4] In addition to the acute morbidity seen with bronchiolitis, infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis and young children who experience virus-induced wheezing illnesses are at increased risk of recurrent wheezing and asthma in early childhood. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The pathogenesis of the increased wheezing after viral bronchiolitis is not fully understood. 4, 5, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] In efforts to learn whether children at risk of bronchiolitis are also at increased risk for asthma, studies have investigated whether a family history of asthma is associated with the severity or incidence of bronchiolitis during infancy, with some prior studies finding an association, whereas others did not. 9, 10, [18] [19] [20] [21] Prospective birth cohorts in which all children have a familial predisposition to asthma, such as a cohort based in Perth, Australia, and the Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) cohort, have investigated the association of a viral cause of infections in early life and subsequent wheezing and asthma. 4, 7, 22 In the COAST cohort HRVinduced wheezing illnesses in early life were found to be stronger predictors of wheezing and asthma at age 6 years than RSVinduced illnesses. 4, 7, 22 However, it is not known whether infants with symptomatic HRV infections that lead to an unscheduled health care visit are more likely to have a familial predisposition to asthma than infants with symptomatic RSV infection.",

Mother-infant dyads were enrolled at the time of an infant ARI during 4 viral respiratory seasons, September through May 2004-2008. 23 Dyads were recruited in the inpatient, emergency department, and clinic settings at a single academic institution, and the children are currently being followed longitudinally through age 6 years to ascertain asthma and atopy outcomes. Each woman provided written informed consent for participation of herself and her infant. The Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board approved the study. During study enrollment, research nurses administered an in-person structured questionnaire that included questions regarding demographics, the infant's home environment, the index infant's illness, previous medical history of the infant, and detailed family asthma and atopic disease history, including maternal responses to the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children questionnaire. 23 At enrollment, research nurses obtained nasal and throat swabs from the infants for viral detection. Through a structured medical chart review, information was abstracted regarding the infant's medical visit, including birth weight, room air pulse oximetry, requirement for supplemental oxygen, history of prior wheezing, and detailed medical information. Final discharge diagnoses were obtained through chart review after discharge.",

Preferentially, women underwent skin prick tests to saline, histamine, and 8 aeroallergens: cat pelt, Alternaria species, grass mix #7, ragweed mix, oak mix, Tricophyton species, mite mix, and cockroach mix (Quintest Extract Tray; Hollister-Stier, Spokane, Wash). 23 Allergen-specific IgE measurement (Phadiatop; Phadia, Kalamazoo, Mich) was performed on maternal blood samples for women who could not undergo skin prick tests or who had an inadequate skin test. Multiallergen screens for specific IgE (Phadiatop) were measured with the ImmunoCAP250 (performed by the Johns Hopkins DACI laboratory). 26 A positive Phadiatop result was defined as 0.35 kU A /L or greater by using the standards in place at the time the assays were performed. 27, 28 Among women for whom allergen sensitization status was determined based on skin prick test results or allergen-specific IgE levels, we classified women by whether they reported a history of asthma into 3 mutually exclusive categories: atopic asthma, nonatopic asthma, and no asthma. Women with selfreported asthma and evidence of allergen sensitization (> _1 positive skin prick test response or positive Phadiatop result) were classified as having atopic asthma, women with self-reported asthma and without evidence of allergen sensitization were classified as having nonatopic asthma, and women who did not report self-reported asthma were in the no asthma group.",

Univariate analyses were conducted to compare maternal asthma factors by the infant's HRV-or RSV-induced ARI status by using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables or the Pearson x 2 test for categorical variables. In our analyses we first defined maternal asthma using self-reported asthma in the women. In addition, to examine the association of maternal asthma in combination with an objective measure of atopy, we repeated all analyses using a more detailed definition that classified women as having atopic asthma, nonatopic asthma, or no asthma by incorporating their skin prick test or allergen-specific IgE findings. Therefore we investigated whether (1) having a mother with self-reported asthma and (2) having a mother with atopic or nonatopic asthma was associated with an infant's ARI with HRV or RSV. We assessed the association of measures of maternal asthma and virus type in the overall ARI group (combined URTI and LRTI) and next among the LRTI subgroup. We applied a logistic regression model with variable HRV(1) or RSV(1) as a binary outcome variable and maternal asthma as defined above, as our main factor along with covariates. Because of our limited regression power determined by the HRV(1) group, we used propensity score adjustment to prevent overfitting because the propensity score analysis adjusts for many confounding factors simultaneously while preserving analytical power. 31 Variables in the propensity score model included a priori selected variables: maternal race/ethnicity, SHS exposure, infant's insurance type, infant's birth weight, infant's sex, infant's age at enrollment, and number of siblings.",

            "text": "In our previous work we found that although, as a group, infants with a history of bronchiolitis had an increased risk of early childhood asthma, infants who had bronchiolitis during HRVpredominant months had a 25% increased risk of early childhood asthma compared with infants who had bronchiolitis during RSVpredominant months. 41 Furthermore, in the COAST birth cohort, in which all children have a familial predisposition to asthma, 7, 14 investigators found that HRV-induced wheezing illnesses in the first 3 years of life were associated with a 9.8-fold relative odds of asthma at 6 years compared with a 2.6-fold increase among children with RSV. 22 We were able to assess whether maternal asthma and atopy were associated with the viral cause and the virus-specific severity of the infant's infection leading to an unscheduled health care visit because this cohort consisted of infants with and without a familial predisposition to asthma, and we used objective measures of maternal atopy and molecular techniques to determine the viral cause of the infant's respiratory tract infection. We found that infants with a mother with atopic asthma had an increased relative odds of having HRV-induced ARIs than RSV-induced ARIs compared with infants whose mothers did not have asthma. It is notable that although the prevalence of self-reported maternal asthma is higher in children with HRV (28%), the 15% prevalence of maternal asthma among infants with RSV-induced ARIs is higher than the asthma prevalence in the adult population in the United States. 42 These study findings suggest that for infants with HRV-induced ARIs in particular, a familial predisposition to asthma might partly explain the increased risk of asthma seen later in life and/or that a familial predisposition to asthma predisposes infants to clinically significant HRVinduced ARIs during infancy, a viral infection that, unlike RSV, can often be isolated from young children without clinically obvious respiratory symptoms. 38 We also found that infants with HRV who had a mother with atopic asthma had more than a 3-fold increased relative odds of having more severe illness than infants whose mothers did not have asthma. Among those with RSV-induced ARIs, there was no relationship between maternal asthma and atopy and ARI severity. The relationship between maternal atopic asthma and the infant's HRV infection severity is intriguing given the described altered host response to HRV, as has been found in vitro and among subjects with asthma. 40, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] These data support the notion of differential susceptibility to HRV among patients with atopic asthma. Continued follow-up of these children until the age of 6 years will further delineate whether it is the subset of infants with HRV-induced ARIs and a familial atopic predisposition who will have asthma and allergic diseases later in childhood or have more severe asthma or recurrent exacerbations. 23 Ultimately, this might help us to understand whether there is an altered host response or increased susceptibility to HRV among patients with atopic asthma.",

            "text": "There are several limitations of this work. This study included a convenience sample of mother-infant dyads in which all infants presented for an unscheduled health care visit and not a cohort followed from birth. However, the study included participants recruited during viral seasons over 4 years, which should serve to strengthen the generalizability of the findings. A single episode of RSV-or rhinovirus-induced ARI was captured. It is likely that children had additional viral infections during infancy. The primary focus of this study was the association of a maternal atopic predisposition and the infant's ARI severity, and therefore we were not able to investigate the outcome of bronchiolitis incidence as in our larger, population-based retrospective cohort of mother-infant dyads. 20 In addition, maternal asthma was determined based on self-report and not based on objective criteria, such as airway reversibility testing. However, we used a validated instrument and self-reported asthma in young adults in whom there is little overlap with other diseases, and thus there is high specificity. 48 Furthermore, this study included objective measures of atopy. Lastly, we cannot completely rule out the possible influence of unknown or unmeasured potential confounding factors, as with all observational studies. In summary, infant HRV infections requiring clinical care were more strongly associated with having a mother with atopic asthma than infant RSV infections. In addition, infants with HRV-induced ARIs who had a mother with atopic asthma had more than a 3-fold increased relative odds of having a more severe ARI compared with that seen in infants with HRV whose mothers did not have asthma. This relationship was not seen in infants with RSV infections. These findings suggest that there is likely an underlying genetic basis for the risk of and response to respiratory tract infections during infancy and that the mechanisms underlying the increased asthma risk after HRV-and RSV-induced bronchiolitis might be different. Future longitudinal investigations successful at preventing or modifying the host response to infant viral infections will provide insight into the relationship of infant viral infections and early childhood asthma, as will investigations that assess the atopic host and nonatopic host response to select respiratory pathogens.",
