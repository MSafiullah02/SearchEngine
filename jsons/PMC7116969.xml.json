            "text": "In many hospitals, isolation rooms for diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), are usually arranged for treating patients who are highly infectious. The quality of the overall hospital environment relies on the air-conditioning design, such as the control of temperature, humidity, pressure, and indoor air quality (IAQ), etc. Special design of air-conditioning and ventilating systems to maintain negative pressure within isolation rooms must be employed to protect health care workers and other patients. The purpose of maintaining negative internal pressure is to restrain the air and bacteria within isolation rooms. Suitable control of internal pressure and airflow direction within isolation rooms can effectively isolate infected patients and inhibit the spread of air and bacteria.",

            "text": "It is known that the design of isolation rooms has a close relationship with indoor air movement, and many studies have been done on indoor air movement. These studies generally focused on analyzing the indoor air distribution, turbulence characteristics, thermal comforts, IAQ, etc. [1], [2]. Two methods, including experimental measurement and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, were commonly adopted in these studies. Because experimental measurement required a lot of time and expense, CFD simulation became one of the most economic and efficient tools to investigate indoor air movement. In order to make the simulation results reliable and accurate, much effort [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] was put into (i) inspecting the influence of different turbulence models, and various numerical schemes and algorithms on the simulation results; and (ii) the verification of simulation and experimental results. Unfortunately, there is still no unique turbulence model, numerical scheme or numerical algorithm valid for solving all indoor air motions. Hence, choosing a reliable turbulence model, numerical scheme and numerical algorithm can increase the accuracy of simulating indoor air motion.",

For instance, Gan [8] employed the CFD method to evaluate the effect of different air supply systems on indoor air distribution, thermal comfort, ventilation effectiveness and IAQ. The numerical results showed that the upward displacement ventilation yielded better IAQ than other systems. Gan and Awbi [9] adopted the concept of age of air to assess the performance of air distribution systems, including IAQ and ventilation efficiency. Chung and Rankin [10] performed both experimental and numerical studies to evaluate the ventilation efficiency in a model room. They focused on the effect of the relative positions between air supply and return as well as location of partitions on the contaminant decay within a model room. Lee and Awbi [11] also performed a similar study using experimental and numerical methods. Within a model room, Hyun and Kleinstreuer [12] used the CFD simulation to examine the influence of airflow from different directions on the spread of carbon dioxide exhaled by a standing human. Bj\u00f8rn and Neilson [13] investigated the airflow interaction and contaminant transport between two breathing persons, a condition important in isolation rooms.",

The sizes of air supply, air outlet, the moving person, the patient, and the sickbed are listed in Table 2a, Table 2b, Table 2c\n. The air change rate of the model room is assumed to be twelve. The temperature and turbulence intensity at the air supply are given by 295.15 K and 20%, respectively. The boundary condition of pressure outlet is specified at the air outlet. The pressure outlet represents that the static pressure is given at that boundary and all other flow quantities are extrapolated from the flow in the interior. In order to keep negative internal pressure, static pressure of \u22128 Pa and turbulence intensity of 10% are given at the pressure outlet. The no-slip condition is applied to all solid surfaces. All boundary walls of the model room are assumed to be adiabatic. Although thermal boundary layer exists on the surface of the moving person, the heat dissipation is not much in a short period of time. Therefore, the moving person is assumed to be adiabatic. The only heat source is the patient body, with activity of 0.8 met (1 met=58.15 W/m2). Accounting for the buoyancy flow within the model room, the Boussinesq approximation is employed. To simulate the contaminant transport within the model room, carbon dioxide is adopted as the contaminant source. The gases exhaled by the patient are assumed to be composed of air and carbon dioxide only and they are released from the mouth, with the temperature of 310.15 K and the velocity magnitude of 0.17617 m/s and the turbulence intensity of 3.6%. The exhaled gases consist of carbon dioxide with a mass fraction of 0.03861825. Those data for contaminant source are similar to that in Hyun and Kleinstreuer [12]. To investigate the effect of different speeds of a moving person on room air distribution, three constant moving speeds of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 m/s are employed. The moving person walks away from air supply and toward air outlet with straight-line motion. He walks back and forth once and stops at the original place till the numerical simulation is stopped.

When the moving speed is equal to 0.25 m/s, transient velocity fields shown in Figs. 2(a) and (b) indicate that the moving person slightly disturbs room air distribution and a weak vortex flow develops behind it. However, Figs. 3(a) and (b) show uniform pressure distribution in this case. When the movement is faster, the variations of velocity and pressure fields become obvious and stronger vortex flow forms behind the moving person, as depicted in other Fig. 2, Fig. 3. Although faster moving speeds result in larger velocity and pressure variations, those changes disappear and the flow field returns to the original state quickly, which usually takes less than 30 s after the moving person returns to the original position. To investigate the contaminant transport affected by the moving person, iso-contours of dimensionless CO2 concentration C\nd equal to 1/1000 are presented in Figs. 4(a)\u2013(f)\n. From these figures, it is found that the iso-contour is concentrated only near the mouth of the patient, and not spread out, no matter what the speed of the moving person is. If the standing person remains motionless, the same iso-contours as those of Figs. 4(a)\u2013(f) is displayed in Fig. 5\n, revealing that the range of contaminant transport is limited only to the surrounding area of the mouth, similar to those results of Figs. 4(a)\u2013(f). The results shown in Figs. 4(a)\u2013(f) indicate that the contaminant transport from the mouth of the patient is not obviously affected by the speed of the moving person.",

To study the influence of the pressure difference between both rooms on room air distribution, the pressure differences of 2.5 and 8 Pa are used. In order to maintain negative internal pressure within the isolation room, the static pressures of \u22122.5 and \u22128 Pa are given at the air outlet, respectively. Each action of opening and closing the door lasts for 2 s and the time duration for one cycle of opening and closing door is 4 s. After one cycle of opening and closing door is completed, the door is closed until the flow field reaches steady state.

They indicate that the internal pressure within the isolation room rises suddenly at the instant of opening the door and reaches the pressure of the anteroom after one second of opening the door. Due to the action of opening the door, the negative internal pressure disappears quickly and the pressures of both rooms equate quickly. At the moment of closing the door, the internal pressure of the isolation room suddenly rises to a higher pressure than that of the anteroom. When the door continues to close, the internal pressure drops quickly and becomes negative again. At the instant that the door is closed completely, the internal room pressure is lower than the specified negative internal pressure and it then rises rapidly to achieve the specified negative internal pressure. At the rest time of numerical simulation, the internal room pressure remains constant after it returns to the specified negative internal pressure. From the above discussion, it can be seen that no matter what the specified negative internal pressure is, the transient variations of internal room pressures have the same trends.",

Moreover, the removal of contaminants from the source is not obviously affected by the moving speed.(2)The opening and closing of a sliding door has profound effects on internal pressure and velocity distributions. It induces airflow into the isolation room from the anteroom and causes sudden rises and drops of the internal pressure during the periods of opening and closing door. Moreover, no matter what the specified pressure difference is, the pressure variations within the isolation room have the same trends. However, contaminant transport is affected only by the magnitude of the specified pressure difference during the period of opening door. After the door is closed, the removal of contaminant source is not influenced by the magnitude of the specified pressure difference.\n",
