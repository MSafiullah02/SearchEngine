            "text": "The HSV genome consists of > 150 Kbp arranged in two stretches of quasi unique sequences each flanked inverted repeats. After infection, viral DNA circularizes. The HSV genome contains at least 74 open reading frames encoding 71 polypeptides including 8 surface glycoproteins, and numerous enzymes and other proteins involved in nucleic acid metabolism and post translational processing of proteins. Viral gene expression is tightly regulated in a cascade fashion by several viral trans-activating factors at least two of which act by interacting with cis-acting sites in viral DNA. Viral DNA is replicated as a rolling circle by proteins specified by the virus. The capsids containing DNA are enveloped at the nuclear membrane and are transported to extracellular space. The functional complexity of HSV genomes is staggering. By means of genetic engineering of deletion mutants, it has been established that the HSV genes form (a) a minimal essential set required for DNA replication, packaging and virion maturation in restricted repertory of cells, and (b) a supplementary essential set which provides precursors and substrates that may be missing in some tissue cells or factors which make the process of replication more efficient. A fringe benefit of the analyses of HSV gene functions by genetic engineering of novel genomes is the development of attenuated, immunogenic viruses for potential use in prevention of diseases caused by HSV.",

            "text": "In humans and in experimental animal models, HSV multiplies at the portal of entry and then infects and establishes a latent infection in sensory neurons. The latent virus becomes periodically activated and is transported to a site at or near the portal of entry where it can cause lesions. The manifestation of human infections are first infections of the mouth and genitals, recurrent lesions at the portal of entry, in the cornea and CNS, adult herpes encephalitis and devastating infections of the newborn acquired during birth. Studies on deletion mutants have led to the identification of several genes whose products are required for viral replication in the central nervous system. Several other genes which are required for the initiation of replication of latent virus have also been identified. As yet no viral gene or sequence has been demonstrated to be essential for the establishment of the latent state. The specific question as to why viral gene functions related to replication on not expressed routinely in sensory neurons remains unanswered. The efficient immortalization of human B-lymphocytes by Epstein-Ban virus (EBV) is presumably accomplished by several viral genes. One of them, the E.B. nuclear antigen-2 (EBNA-2) has been shown genetically to be required for immortalization. Two additional viral genes likely to be required include that encoding the latent membrane protein (LMP) and EBNA-1. We have found that LMP shares many biochemical properties with receptors for growth-factors. It homes to the plasma membrane, turns over rapidly, its turnover is inhibited by treatment of cells with cycloheximide and is probably preceded by its internalization from the cell surface. Functional mutants of LMP have these properties; non-functional ones do not. We suggest that these properties support a model in which LMP is a receptor-like protein or affects the function of a cellular receptor to alter the growth characteristics of cells in which it is expressed.",

            "text": "It is known that EBNA-1 both activates transcription and mediates plasmid replication by binding specifically to elements within oriP, the origin of plasmid replication of EBV. In an attempt to dissect EBNA-1's contributions to these two functions we constructed a chimeric protein that consists of the estrogen receptor with the DNA binding domain of EBNA-1 in place of its own. This protein activates the enhancer within oriP in the presence of its ligand but does not support the replication of oriP. We suggest that EBNA-1 conmbutes an activity to DNA replication distinct from those required for transcriptional activation. The mechanisms responsible for viral clearance and hepatocellular injury in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are not clearly understood, although it is generally believed that a cellular immune response to one or more HBV encoded antigens plays an important role in these processes. Using transgenic mice which express some or all of the gene products of the HBV genome we have identified multiple, direct and indirect, pathways for clearance of the HBV positive hepatocyte. First, we have observed liver cell injury after transfer of HBsAg primed spleen cells and cloned, MHC class I restricted, CD8+, cytotoxic T lymphocytes into syngeneic mice that express the HBV envelope antigens. These results suggest that HBsAg is a potential target antigen on the surface of HBV positive hepatocytes and provide the first definitive evidence that a CTL response to a defined subregion of this antigen can cause liver cell injury in vivo. Second, we have shown that HBsAg positive hepatocytes are exquisitely sensitive to the hepatocytotoxic effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), that LPS-induced liver cell injury can be prevented by the prior administration of antibodies to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and to gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), and that the effect can be reproduced by the administration of recombinant TNF-alpha and EN-gamma, but not by recombinant interleukin 1 or interleukin 6. We have also shown that the same cytokines modulate the steady state levels of all of the HBV-encoded RNA transcripts in this model. These results suggest that the release of these cytokines by HBV antigen specific and nonspecific infilnating inflammatory cells may influence not only the expression of the HBV genome by the hepatocyte, but also may lead to its elimination in an antigen nonspecific manner. Finally, dysregulated overexpression of the HBV large envelope polypeptide by the hepatocyte leads to the production of long, filamentous, nonsecretable HBsAg particles which accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum, causing it to become hyperplastic, and eventually kill the cell. The prolonged liver cell injury characteristic of this model eventually leads to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Preliminary evidence suggests that reactive oxygen intermediates may play a central role in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular injury in this lesion. In aggregate, these results suggest that several mechanisms may be involved in clearance of the HBV-infected hepatocyte and in the pathogenesis of HBV-induced liver disease, they indicate directions for further study of the molecular and cellular basis of the chronic carrier state, and they lay the groundwork for the development of therapeutic strategies to terminate chronic HBV infection and prevent its progression to hepatocellular carcinoma. We have been studying the mechanism by which human interferon-a (IFNa) induces expression of a discrete set of genes. The signal transduction pathway used by lFNa has been traced by first identifying primary response genes, studying the physiology of their induction, identification of their regulatory elements, and analysis of the proteins mediating this regulation. We are now studying the biochemical mechanisms responsible for delivering to the nucleus the signal produced by lFNa binding to its specific cell surface receptor.",

            "text": "lFNa stimulated genes are directly induced at the transcriptional level in response to lFNa treatment but not by any other cytokine tested. This process is mediated by pre-existing proteins with no requirement for ongoing protein synthesis. Transcriptional induction is mediated by a cisacting DNA sequence found in the promoters of all IFNa-stimulated genes. This DNA sequence serves as the binding site for a complex of proteins, termed ISGF3, which is activated by lFNa treatment and required for transcriptional induction. These proteins are sequestered in the cytoplasm of untreated cells where they are acted upon following lFNa binding to its cell surface receptor. This activation event stimulates their translocation to the nucleus and assembly of a transcriptionally active complex on DNA. The ultimate transcription factor complex is composed of two distinct components: a 48 kDa DNA binding protein and a regulatory complex composed of three polypeptides of 84, 91, and 113 kDa. These regulatory proteins are the target for activation in response to the liganded receptor, being stimulated to translocate to the nucleus, where they modulate the DNA binding affinity of the 48 kDa DNA-binding protein. One or more of the regulatory polypeptides of lSGF3 is phosphorylated by a kinase activity which can be inhibited by staurosporine or K-252a. However, it is unlikely that a global activation of protein kinase C or calcium-or CAMP-dependent kinases is involved in lFNa signalling. Direct transfer of receptoractivated transcription factor subunits from cytoplasm to nucleus maintains the specificity and rapidity of the lFNa response in the absence of a traditional second messenger signalling system. The ability of cis-regulatory DNA sequences to alter or control the organ specificity and persistence of polyoma in mice is examined. We have previously shown that either deletions or substitutions of cis regulatory can either restrict or expand the acute organ specificity of virus replication and that this effect is generally cisrestricted for DNA replication. We further examine the genetics of acute infections and establish the importance of the Py A enhancer in this specificity. We have also examined the relationship between cell division and Acute Py infections with the aim to understand why Py infections are normally restricted to newborn animals. Host cell division in target organs is not detectably induced by Py virus replication but may be necessary. In addition, Py variants with in vivo pancreas organ specificity are not also specific for replication in transformed cells from the pancreas.",

Lee+, 'Dept. of Microbiology and tDept. of Genetics and Development, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, N.Y. 10032, and +Lederle-Praxis Biologicals, Pearl River, N.Y. 10965 Poliovirus infection is limited to primates, and within the infected animal, the virus replicates at very few sites, including lymphoid tissues of the gut and pharynx, and motor neurons within the central nervous system. Examination of the expression of the cell receptor for poliovirus (PVR) revealed the presence of PVR RNA and protein in a wide variety of human tissues, including those that are not susceptible to poliovirus infection. To further study the relationship between PVR expression and poliovirus tissue tropism, a human PVR gene was isolated and used to generate transgenic mice. Several PVR transgenic mouse lines were established that express PVR transcripts and poliovirus binding sites in a wide variety of tissues, including brain, spinal cord, kidney, liver, lung and intestine. Intracerebral inoculation of PVK transgenic mice with poliovirus type 1 Mahoney resulted in viral replication in the brain and spinal cord and development of paralytic poliomyelitis. In contrast, nontransgenic mice did not develop disease after inoculation with this strain. PVR transgenic mice also developed poliomyelitis after intravenous, intraperitoneal, and intramuscular inoculation with type 1 poliovirus. After intravenous inoculation with poliovirus, viral replication was confined to the brain and spinal cord of transgenic mice. When PVR expression was examined by in situ hybridization, RNA was detected in many transgenic mouse organs, but largely in specific cell types. Poliovirus infection is therefore restricted in the PVR transgenic mice, despite widespread expression of virus binding sites. These results suggest that poliovirus tissue tropism may be controlled by other factors required for cell entry or replication. However, the PVR is clearly the major determinant of poliovirus host range. PVR transgenic mice should be useful for studying poliovirus tissue tropism, neurovirulence, and attenuation, and for the development and perhaps testing of poliovirus vaccine strains. We have used molecular genetic approaches to define the protein and RNA determinants of picornavirus replication. The first approach involves a study of the polypeptide requirements for poliovirus RNA synthesis. Our work has focused on the role of polypeptide 3AB (a membrane-associated precursor of the genome-linked protein, VPg) in the initiation of poliovirus RNA synthesis. We employed sitedirected mutagenesis to generate a number of amino acid replacement and insertion mutants in the hydrophobic domain contained within polypeptide 3AB. One 3AE3 mutation produced a mutant virus (Sel-3AB-310/4) that was temperature sensitive for viral RNA synthesis. Biochemical analysis of in vivo and in vitro RNA synthesis of this mutant indicated that it is defective in initiation of ( + ) strand RNA synthesis and in synthesis of VPg-pU(pU), a nucleotidyl protein that has been proposed as a primer for the viral polymerase. Our results provide evidence in support of a model in which polypeptide 3AE3 serves as carrier for VP to initiate (+) strand RNA synthesis. They also suggest that a separate mechanism could be usefin the initiation of (-) strand RNA synthesis. We have extended our study of picornavirus RNA replication in an attempt to define the cis versus trum nature of replication functions supplied by specific viral polypeptides. We have engineered several deletion and insertion mutations into a bacteriophage T7 in vifro transcription vector containing poliovirus cDNA sequences. We have employed complementation analysis using either cotransfected pairs of mutant RNAs or rescue of a single transfected mutant RNA by a superinfecting virus that contains coxsackievirus B3 sequences in the 5' noncoding region of its genome. Slot blot anal sis using template-specific oligonucleotide probes allows one replicating template to be distinguished $om the other. One of the mutant viruses we have recovered, Sel-3D-18, contains an amino acid insertion in the viral RNA polymerase and is ts for RNA synthesis. Our data demonstrate that the RNA synthesis defect of 3D-18 at 39OC can be rescued in trans. A second ap roach that we have initiated to determine the viral se uences required for successful completion o ! a picornavirus life cycle involves the genetic alteration 0 1 sequences in the 5' noncoding region (5' NCR) of poliovirus RNA. We have produced deletion and substitution mutations as well as a limited set of linker scanning mutations within the poliovirus 5' NCR. Genetic and biochemical analysis suggests that lesions which disrupt predicted secondary structures within this 742 nucleotide region of viral RNA produce deleterious effects on virus growth. Some of these effects result from defective translation initiation and may be attributable to altered RNA-protein interactions within the 5' NCR of the poliovirus genome. Understanding the nature of such RNA-protein complexes will provide insights into the mechanisms employed by picornaviruses to insure efficient replication of their genetic information. Transcription factor AP-1 plays a pivotal role in control of cell growth and proliferation, and its activpty is tightly regulated in cells. Stimulation of quiescent cells by exposure to mitogens, growth factors, or othx extracellular stimuli causes a rapid increase in AP-1 activity. Transfection of a number of oncogenes including ras, raf, src, and mos also enhances AP-1 activity, suggesting that at least part of the effect of these oncogenes on gene expression is mediated by changes in AP-1 activity. The two major components of AP-1 purified from HeLa cells are the products of the two proto-oncogenes c-jun and c-fos. Both c-Jim and c-Fos proteins have a bipartite DNA binding domain, which consisits of a region rich in basic amino acids that is involved in sequence-specific DNA binding and an adjacently located leucine repeat that mediates dimer formation. c-Jun forms homodimers that binds DNA in a sequence specific manner and activate transcription from templates containing AP-1 sites. c-Jun can also form a heterodimer with c-Fos that binds DNA more tightly than the c-jun homdmer and is more potent at activating transcription.",

            "text": "To analyze the regulation of c-Jun transcriptional activity we have constructed chimeric proteins in which the DNA binding and dimerization domains of c-Jun are replaced by DNA binding domains of the yeast GAL4 transcriptional activator, or the bovine papilloma virus transactivator E2. The transcriptional properties of these chimeric proteins have been determined by co-transfection assays in several cell-lines. Our analysis reveals that c-Jun contains two transcriptional activation domains (A1 and A2) and a negative regulatory region (6). The A2 domain located near the DNA binding domain is constitutive. A1 located within the amino terminal half is a regulated activation domain which is active in some cell-types but not others. In vivo competition experiments suggest that A1 is regulated by interaction with an inhibitory activity that is cell-type specific and therefore A1 is a cell-type specific activation domain. The 6 region located adjacent to the A1 domain regulates it by facilitating or stabilizing the inhibitory activity. The cellspecific repression of the 6 and A1 domain is recapitulated with in vitro transcription experiments. Our findings may help explain how the retroviral homolog, v-jun, is transforming. Transforming activity of the v-jun coding sequences has been traced to the lack of a 6 region in v-jun. The 6 region is a negative regulatory region and therefore v-Jun transcriptional activity is not as effectively inhibited as that of c-Jun. Consequently, v-jun is a transforming protein probably because it is a more potent transcriptional activator than c-jun. The results of these and other experiments examining the role of the A1 domain in modulating c-jun transcriptional activity in response to physiolgical cues will be discussed.",

The chicken cellular Jun protein has a low capacity for inducing transformation in chicken embryo fibroblast cultures, while the viral Jun is an effective oncogenic transformer. Two changes are needed to turn the poorly transforming celluar jun gene into an active oncogene: a deletion in the amino proximal region, presumably interfering with the binding of a cellular inhibitor, and removal of 3' untranslated sequences that cause mRNA instability. Besides activating transcription Jun can also stimulate DNA synthesis. Mutants and recombinants of viral and various cellular Jun proteins show a rough correlation between their ability to transform chicken embryo fibroblasts and stimulation of DNA synthesis as well as transactivation.

It was determined that both murine and human wild type p53 proteins block the DNA replication initiation functions of SV40 T Ag in vitro. Two mutant p53 phenotypes were observed: mutant p53 that fails to inhibit DNA synthesis at all concentrations tested, and mutant p53 that inhibits this process only at low but not at higher concentrations. This latter phenotype suggests that such p53 may preferentially self-associate at higher concentrations. Interestingly wild type human p53 synthesized in bacteria, and thus presumably unmodified, behaves like the second type of mutant suggesting that phosphorylation of p53 may regulate p53:T vs p53:p53 interactions. This hypothesis is currently being tested. Understanding the processes by which wild type and mutant p53 proteins interact with T antigen and with eachother may provide insight into the roles of p53 within cells.",

We have established that ATP induces the assembly of Py T Ag into hexamers and alters its interactions with the viral replication origin. Py T Ag, like SV40 T Ag, is a DNA helicase that can unwind duplex DNA. However, unlike SV40 T Ag, Py T Ag displays little sequence specificity for DNA unwinding under normal replication conditions suggesting that additional activities of Py T Ag are involved in its replication initiation functions. Related to this Py T Ag displays a specific interaction with murine but not human DNA polymerase. Another marked difference between the two T antigens is related to the effects of phosphorylation upon their replication function. Treatment of SV40 T Ag with alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) activates its replication function by increasing its binding to the SV40 origin. By contrast, removal of phosphates from Py T Ag by CIAP blocks Py ori-DNA replication in a manner that is apparently unrelated to its binding to the Py origin. The replication of plasmid DNAs containin the Simian Virus 40 origin of DNA replication has been reconstituted in uitro with highly puriaed proteins. In addition to the virus encoded large tumor antigen (TAP), which functions as an origin recognition protein and DNA helicase, seven cellular proteins have been identified as essential components. These include replication factor A (RF-A), a multi-subunit single strand DNA binding protein (SSB) that is required for initiation and elongation; RF-C, a multi-subunit DNA-dependent ATPase and primer binding protein; PCNA, a co-factor for RF-C and DNA polymerase 6; polymerase a/ primase complex; DNA polymerase 6 and the to oisomerases I and 11. The mechanism of DNA replication using these proteins will be discussel To begin to understand the regulation of DNA replication in euka otic cells, we have focused our attention on the initiation and ori unwinding events, both of w h i z require RF-A. RF-A consists of three protein subunits with molecular weights of 70K, 34K, and 11K in both human and yeast cells. The 70K subunit is the SSB, but phosphorylation of the 34K subunit enhances RF-A DNA binding and function.

            "text": "Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510 The primary bovine papillomavirus (BPV) gene responsible for morphologic transformation of established lines of rodent fibroblasts is the E5 gene which encodes a 44-amino acid, very hydrophobic protein that is among the smallest transforming proteins known. Efficient transformation by the E5 protein requires a very short \"active site\" that may consist of as few as seven amino acids. The overall hydrophobicity of the molecule is also important although many random hydrophobic sequences can functionally substitute for the wild type one. We have found that the receptor for platelet-derived growth factor is specifically and constitutively activated in fibroblasts transformed by the BPV and deer papillomavirus (DPV) E5 genes. When the E5 protein is delivered acutely into cells, receptor activation precedes the proliferative response to this protein. December, 1990). The E6 promoted degradation of p53 is ATP dependent and involves the ubiquitindependent protease system. The selective degradation of cellular proteins, such as p53 with negative regulatory functions, provides a novel mechanism of action for dominant acting oncoproteins. Thus the papillomaviruses appear to exert some of their proliferative and oncogenic effects through the interactions of their encoded proteins with key cellular proteins. The long terminal repeat (LTR) of HIV-1 contains multiple cis-acting regulatory elements that modulate the degree of HIV RNA synthesis and viral replication. These include the target for tat transactivation, the TAR region, as well as two binding sites for the cellular transcriptional factor NF-KB and three binding sites for Spl. Previous studies have demonstrated the role of the NF-KB sites in mediating LTR activation by phorbol ester and cytokines in both transient transfection assays and in chronically-infected T cell and promonocytic cell lines. The NF-KB sites are not required for HIV infection of T lymphocytes however, as deletion of these sites from an infectious molecular clone of HIV does not block viral replication. Deletion of the three LTR Spl binding sites results in a virus that is capable of infecting some, but not all, T cells. The Spl deleted virus replicated efficiently in human T cells containing NF-KB binding activity such as periperal blood lymphocytes and MT4 cells, however replicated poorly, or not at all in cells lacking NF-KB activity such as A3.01 cells. Activators of NF-KB could induce replication of the Sp-deleted virus in A3.01 cells, suggesting that NF-KB can functionally substitute for Spl in activating HIV replication. Deletion of both NF-KB sites and all three Spl sites resulted in loss of viral infectivity as did a mutation in the TAR region that eliminated tat transactivation. In recent studies, the roles of the individual NF-KB and Spl binding sites have been evaluated by reconstructing LTRs containing these sites individually and in combination. Viruses containing juxtaposed NF-KB and Spl binding sites are more potent activators of HIV replication than those containing two copies of either site alone; two copies of either site are more efficient in supporting viral replication than are single sites. These studies suggest that the HIV LTR is similar to the promoter/enhancer elements of other viruses in that it is composed of multiple functional elements that contribute differentially to viral replication in different cell types. Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HT.LV-1) is a n etiologic agent of adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and also associated with tropical spastic paraparesia (TSP). Viral replication and gene expression are regulated by at least two trans-acting regulators, tax and rex, that are encoded by its own genome. Tax protein is a transcriptional activator that activates the viral enhancer consisting of 21 bp. Cellular proteins (TREB) that bind to the 21 bp viral enhancer and their cDNA were characterized. TREB proteins contain leucine zipper and basic amino acid domain structure and are member of a CREB family. TREB proteins were found to activate or suppress the gene expression in cell line-specific fashion. Interaction of tax protein with these TREB proteins and also with the DNA are currently investigated. Tax also activates cellular genes such as IL-2, IL-2 receptor, GM-CSF, FOS. PTHrP and MHC class I. A cellular DNA binding NF-rB was proposed to be involved in the activation of IL-2 receptor a gene. These activations of cellular gene may explain some phenotypes of ATL cells and ATL patients, however, may not be sufficient to explain malignancy of ATL cells..The other trans-regulator rex modulates RNA processing and stimulates the expression of unspliced mRNA that codes gag, pol and env. On the other hand, rex repress the expression of fully spliced tax/rex mRNA. For these regulation. rex require the specific sequence in the 3LTR that forms a very stable secondary structure. and rex recognizes the secondary structure.",

The V3 domain, which has been proposed as the principal target for neutralization, was amplified from sequential virus isolates from four patients by a polymerase chain reaction with nested primers and directly sequenced by a novel semi-automated DNA sequencing method. Results: The deduced amino acid sequence of the V3 domain remained unchanged over time in three patients, despite the emergence of neutralization-resistant virus variants in two patients. In one patient only the emergence of neutralization-resistant virus variants coincided with mutations in the V3 domain. Conclusions: We show that resistance of HIV-1 to neutralization by autologous sera may be caused by mutations both inside and outside the V3 domain. The complete envelope gene will be sequenced to establish the mechanism for virus escape from neutralization in all four patients. The presence of budding C-type and intracytoplasmic A-type particles in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells is well documented. However, extensive screening has failed to detect any evidence of infectivity. Continuous-flow ultracentrifugation has been used to concentrate extracellular particles from culture fluid of a recombinant CHO cell subclone for molecular characterization. Particles exhibiting reverse transcriptase activity and associated with mammalian C-type retrovirus structural antigens banded in sucrose gradients at a density characteristic of retroviruses. Double-gradient purified particles contained RNA which hybridized to probes for murine leukemia virus, and endogenous Chinese hamster intracisternal A-particle (IAP) elements. DNA sequence analysis of a cDNA clone isolated from purified particles revealed multiple interruptions of the endonuclease reading frame, providing one possible explanation for the non-infectious nature of the observed particles. Sequences present as RNA in purified particles were also present as conserved, repetitive, provirus sequences in genomic DNA of all CHO cell lines examined and in Chinese hamster liver DNA. The observed particles are therefore likely to be the products of endogenous retroviruslike elements present in the germline of Chinese hamsters. We analyzed immunological signals and molecular events leading to transactivation of the HIV-1-LTR in human IL-2 dependent, cloned T lymphocytes transiently transfected with a luciferase gene under the control of various regions of the HIV-1-LTR. Specific antigen presentation (tetanus toxoid) by autologous macrophages to a specific T cell clone led to clear transactivation of the HIV-LTR. PMA similarly transactivated the whole HIV-LTR or the HIV-enhancer and translocated NFkB-like proteins to the nucleus. Anti-CD3 antibody induced TNF and lymphotoxin production in the cells and promoted massive nuclear translocation of NFkB-like proteins, however, this did not lead to HIV-LTR transactivaiton.",

Efficient transactivation in human T cells may rely on post-translational modifications of one or more proteins of this complex. Infection with HIV-1 may lead either to destruction of the host cell or to a persistant, noncytopathic infection. The outcome has been correlated with the amount of unintegrated viral DNA present in the host cell. While accumulation of large quantities of unintegrated viral DNA is a hallmark of an acute, cytopathic infection, significant amounts of unintegrated viral DNA are not generally observed in persistent HIV-1 infections. This has been ascribed to immunity from reinfection due to the loss or down-modulation of the CD4 receptor, a feature of most continuously infected cell lines. Using PCR of crude cell lysates, we have detected unintegrated HIV-1 DNA in chronically infected T lymphocytic (ACH-2, J1) and promyelocytic (OM-10.1) cell lines. Treatment with AZT or soluble CD4 inhibited accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA at least tenfold within 72 hours; removal of AZT permitted recovery to pre-treatment levels within 72 hours. Our results indicate that unintegrated HIV-1 DNA is unstable in these cell lines and originates from a continuous process of reinfection. Interestingly, the accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA was not correlated with the level of CD4 surface expression. By flow cytometry, OM-10.1 cells had relatively high levels of both surface CD4 expression and unintegrated viral DNA. ACH-2 and J1 cells were CD4-negative by flow cytometry, yet ACH-2 cells had a very low level of unintegrated viral DNA and J1 cells had a level of unintegrated viral DNA similar to OM-10.1 cells. This implies that the number of CD4 receptors is not rate-limiting for reinfection. We have been able to detect unintegrated HIV-1 DNA in PBLs from asymptomatic individuals as well as AIDS patients. Clinical studies are underway in our laboratory to establish a correlation between unintegrated DNA and disease progression.

The binding function is mediated by specific association of the external subunit of the viral envelope glycoprotein (gpl20) with CD4, whereas the fusion event involves interaction of the transmembrane subunit (gp41) with the target cell membrane. A similar type of interaction is believed to mediate fusion between HIV-infected cells and CD4+ cells. We are investigating the possibility that CD4 binding might induce fusionrelated structural changes in the envelope glycoprotein (gp12O/gp41) complex. Soluble CD4 (sCD4) was found to promote dissociation of gp120 from the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein complex expressed on the surface of cells infected with a vaccinia virus vector. sCD4-induced release of gp120 was dependent on time, temperature, and sCD4 concentration, and was associated with specific binding between these molecules. Release of gp120 was also induced by synthetic peptide derivatives corresponding to residues 81-92 of human CD4 (the CDR3like region), which have previously been shown to inhibit HIV-mediated cell-cell fusion. A peptide containing the substitution of gly for glu at the postion correponding to CD4 residue 87 had greatly reduced gp120 release activity, consistent with the effect of this substitution on the cell fusion inhibitory activity of the peptide, as well as on the ability of membrane-associated CD4 to mediate cell fusion.

To determine whether tat can bind TAR RNA in vitro, we have conducted gel retardation assays using 32P-labelled RNA and highly purified tat in which cysteine residues were blocked by sulfitolysis. Under nondenaturing binding and gel electrophoresis conditions tat was found to bind,nonspecifically to non-TAR as well as TAR RNA species. In contrast, specific TAR-tat complexes were observed on 7 M urea acrylamide gels following bindinq in the presence of 0.1% to 1% SDS, 4 M urea or 1 M sodium iodide. iMutations in the lower stem, upper stem and bulqe of the TAR-stem-loop resulted in reduced binding under these conditions, but binding was unaffected by mutations in the loop. These data suggest that strong denaturing conditions can reveal protein and/or RNA regions required for formation of specific complexes, and that under these conditions tat cysteine residues are not directly required for RNA binding. The denaturation conditions used may induce protein or RNA conformational changes that mimic changes induced in vivo by cellular factors. Early, regulatory gene products are encoded by multiply spliced mRNA species and are expressed constitutively. In contrast, the late, structural proteins of HIV-1 are encoded by an unspliced or singly spliced class of viral transcripts whose cytoplasmic expression is dependent upon the viral Rev trans-activator. We will present data demonstrating that the viral Vif and Vpr gene products are encoded by singly-spliced viral mRNAs whose expression is activated by Rev. This activation is shown to result from the reduced utilization of splice sites adjacent to or within the vif and coding sequences. The observation that vif and belong to the late class of HIV-1 gene products is consistent with the hypothesis that Rev activates the expression of incompletely spliced HIV-1 transcripts by circumventing a cellular barrier to nuclear RNA export that is imposed by the presence of intact splice sites.",

Combination of HIVl M)K derived fragments Bss/HII/SpeI and EcuRI/XhoI was necessary for the full expression of HIVl NDK fusonegic phenotype ; the HlVl NDK env and gag genes alone were not sufficient to obtain high titer of large syncytia. Different regions of HIVl genome were responsible for the direct-killing and fusogenic effect. LTR and regulatory genes vpr, tat and rev were not responsible for the variation of HIVl replication kinetic. HIV-1 reverse transcriptase forms a heterodimer composed of two subunits (p51 and p66), which have identical N-termini. Compared to p51, the p66 subunit has an additional C-terminal domain, p15. The amino acid sequence of the p15 domain shows homology with RNase H of other retroviruses as well as with E. coli RNase H. T o examine the functional interaction between the domains of HIV-1 RT, we expressed them separately and purified both to homogeneity. The N-terminal domain (p5 1 ) behaves as a monomeric protein exhibiting salt sensitive DNA polymerase activity. The isolated C-terminal domain (p15) has no detectable RNase H activity. However, purified p51 and p15 combined in vitro reconstitutes RNase H activity on a defined substrate. These results demonstrate that domains of HIV-1 RT, although structurally distinct, are functionally interdependent. The p15 domain has been crystallized as large trigonal prisms which diffract X-rays to a resolution of at least 2.5 A. A full three dimensional structural elucidation of the p15 domain is now underway. Why one group of HTLV-I seropositive individuals develops a neoplastic condition, another develops neurologic symptoms, and a third group remains as asymptomatic carriers of the virus is not known. The various mainfestations of an HTLV-I infection may be related to differences in genetic backgrounds of individuals, infection with variant strains of HTLV-I or differences in target tissue tropism of the virus. Another possibility is that differences in host immune responses to HTLV-I contribute to these varied HTLV-I associated conditions. While the humoral response to HTLV-I is well characterized, little is known about the human cellular imune response, such as cytotoxic T cells (CTL) particularly in patients with neurological diseases associated with HTLV-I.",

These CTL are CD8t, HLA class I restricted and predominantly recognize the HTLV-I gene products encoded in the HTLV-I regulatory region, pX. These findings suggest that HTLV-I specific CTL may contribute to the pathogenesis of HTLV-I associated neurological disorders. To address this question we have constructed a recombinant baculovirus that expresses a p46 gag representing the HIV gag open readin frame truncated at the frameshift site and lacking the carboxy terminal p6 domain. We show t%at this recombinant produces high levels of p46 gag antigen which is secreted into the culture media as an HIV core like particle. We conclude that the carboxy terminal p6 domain of gag plays no role in particle formation suggesting that failure of p160 gag-pol t o assemble is a consequence of the presence of the p o l domain. In addition, these results suggest that replacement of the p6 domain with foreign antigens may be possible in order t o use truncated gag antigens as particulate carriers. One possibility to account for HIV infection of macrophages is that HIV initially infects cells of early myeloid lineage, which later differentiate into infected macrophages. We have investigated this possibility using the multipotent cell line HL-60, which can be induced to differentiate into various cell types under different conditions. First, we have tested the effects of cell differentiation on gene expression driven by the long terminal repeat (LTR) of HIV. When cells were treated with PMA, which causes differentiation into macrophage-like cells, CAT activity increased by 10 to 20 fold. This induction appears to be mediated through as yet unidentified inducible factor(s), in addition to NF-kB. Also, we have subcloned HL-60 cells infected with HIV. Our preliminary data suggest that viral production increases upon treatment of these cells with PMA, but only transiently. We are currently analyzing the kinetics of RNA expression upon PMA induction. Data will also be presented concerning the effect of HIV infection on cell differentiation, assayed by the expression of several cell surface proteins. vifand vpr genes. The products of these genes are not required for regulation of HIV gene expression nor are they found in mature vim particles. It seems likely that these proteins play a role in regulating virus assembly either by regulating virion protein biosynthesis or, alternatively, by acting as \"molecular chaperones\" that help direct virion proteins towards the budding particle on the cellular membrane. Viruses carrying mutations in the vpu gene show delayed release of progeny virus, and an accumulation of characteristic virion particles with an \"immature\" morphology and an unusual pattern of budding. Vpu also shows a homology to a number of membrane-bound proteins including two other viral proteins known to influence virion assembly, the foot-and-mouth disease virus p3A protein. and the influenza virus M2 protein. We have found that vpu plays a role in envelope glycoprotein levels and processing.",

Vpu is also active in trans, and increases gp160 expression 3to 4-fold. Cleavage of gpl60 to gp12O/gp41 takes place prior to the acquisition of endo-H resistance by the addition of complex sugars in the trans Golgi, and is independent of vpu. Treatment of cells expressing vpu. with NH&I increases the levels of gp160 and gp120, presumably by inhibiting lysozomal degradation of the envelope glycoproteins. NWCI also partially inhibits cleavage of gp160 to gp120/gp41. However, in the absence of vpu NWCI has little effect on either the level of gp160 expression or the rate of gp160 cleavage. lmmunofluaescence microscopy has demonstrated that both vpu and gp160 accumulate in wheat germ agglutinin-stained vesicles of the Golgi, but neither protein is transponed to the cell surface. In contrast. gp120 and gag proteins are found associated with cytoplasmic membranes which are not stained by wheat gem agglutinin, and a small amount of gp120 can also be detected on the cell surface. It is proposed that vpu acts as an ion channel which regulates the pH of the Golgi and thereby indirectly influences envelope protein processsing and accumulation. The latent T cell line, ACH-2, was used to investigate the accumulation of the 2-LTR circular form of (unintegrated) HIV-1 DNA after TNF-alpha (TNF-a) induction. Using PCR to amplify across the 2-LTR junction, we have determined the cellular location and relative abundance of circular HIV-1 DNA following TNF-a stimulation. A ten-fold increase in HIV-1 p24 antigen was detected in the 48-hour supernatant of TNF-a induced ACH-2 cultures (500 Ng/ml) over unstimulated controls (<50Ng/ml). Concommitantly a 10-fold increase in circular HIV DNA was detected in the treated cells by PCR analysis following limiting dilution. To identify the cellular compartmental location of the circular DNA accumulation, the cells were fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear components and analyzed by PCR. Southern analysis of 2-LTR amplified product from the treated cells indicated that the nucleus was the source of the 2-LTR HIV-I DNA. To support the PCR analysis, fluorescent _in situ hybridization was performed on ACH-2 cells following TNF-a induction. Using a biotinylated HIV-1 DNA probe, increased nuclear fluorescence was observed in the TNF-a induced cells over controls. These findings indicate that 2-LTR HIV DNA accumulates in the nucleus of TNF-a induced latent cells and offers insight into the role of unintegrated viral DNA in pathogenesis. To characterize a unique Guaymi Indian HTLV-I1 isolate (PNAS, Nov. 15, 1990) a peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) cell line (G 12.1) was established by co-culture methods. A continuous IL-2 dependent cell line has been maintained independent of normal feeder PBLs for 10 months of culture. The cell line has sustained production of soluble and cell surface HTLV-I1 p24 capsid proteins (assessed by antigen capture assay and avidin-biotin-complex assays), contains approximately 10 copies of proviral HTLV-I1 DNA per cell as determined Southern blot analysis, budding HTLV particles has been observed by electron microscopy, and lethally irradiated G12.1 cells transmitted the HTLV-I1 infection to rabbits. Western blot analysis using type specific monoclonal antibodies and PCR analysis using strain specific oligonucleotide primers and probes have confirmed the virus type to be HTLV-11. Serum derived from the Guaymi Indian donor was positive for antibody reactivity in HTLV-I1 specific u peptide-based assays and failed to react with HTLV-1 u and gag peptides. Phenotype analysis by FACS indicated the cell line to be CD4+ (Leu 3a) and CDw29+ (4B4) with high expression of CD25 (IL-2R, L243) and CD71 (transfer receptor); the cell line was negative for CD8, CD14, CD16, and CD19 antigens. In addition, the cell line produced the cytokines gamma interferon and GM-CSF, but is negative for IL-4 and TNF-alpha. A G12.1 genomic DNA library has been constructed and 4 molecular clones which hybridize to both HTLV-I1 and gjg specific DNA probes have been isolated. These clones are currently being exploited for nucleotide sequencing and other studies. The G12.1 cell line will allow continued characterization of this unique HTLV-I1 isolate.",

Specific objectives were (i) to generate replication competent proviral clones from uncultured human tissue thereby allowing an analysis of genome organization and gene structure-function relationships of virus not subjected to in vitro selection pressures, (ii) to generate transfection-derived HIV-1 strains without interim cell culture for analysis of replicative DNA intermediate forms, integration status, and the possible existence of defective andfor helper forms, (iii) to compare and characterize genotypic variation of proviral clones obtained by direct lambda phage cloning to clones obained by PCR amplification. High molecular weight DNA from a brain specimen obtained at necropsy was subjected to lambda phage cloning and 10 HIV-1 proviral clones were obtained out of 8 x lo6 recombinants. These proviral clones contained integrated and unintegrated forms, forms with one or two LTRs, and genomes with large deletions and self-integrated reversed LTR sequences. Eight HIV-1 proviral clones (in lambda) and 11 PCR derived clones from the same brain were sequenced in a 525 bp hypervariable envelope region. All 19 clones were highly related yet distinct with nucleotide variation between 0.1 and 0.3%. Four proviral clones in lambda were full-length by restriction mapping, and one of these was subsequently shown to be transfection-competent in Cos-1 cells and replication competent in human T cells and monocytes after cell free passage.

We are currently investigating the possibilities that Tax may induce NF-kB through a receptor mediated signal transduction event or via direct effects of internalized Tax, on the stability of the NF-kB-IkB cytoplasmic complex. The human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I encodes a regulatory protein Tax, which activates expression of both viral and cellular genes and has been implicated in the transforming potential of the virus. Since antibodies to Tax are often found in the serum of patients infected with the virus, it is interesting 10 consider that Tax, may be present as an extracellular protein and may play a role in progression of HTLV-Iassociated disease. We have recently demonstrated that extracellular Tax, is taken up by a variety of cell types including human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and transported to the nucleus as an intact 40 kD protein. To investigate the potential role of extracellular Tax, in cell growth regulation, human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were cultured from healthy HIV and HTLV-I negative donors.

Recent evidence suggests that the immediate early (IE) proteins of the Herpes Simplex (HSV) and Cytomegaloviruses (CMV) may function indirectly by modifying host cell transcription factors, one of which may be LBPl. LBPl binds cooperatively to a large region downstream from the RNA start site, a region that contributes to the basal activity of the promoter and, more recently, has been shown to be critical for responsiveness of the HIV-1 promoter to transactivation by CMV-IE proteins. We purified LBPl to near homogeneity from HeLa cells by sequential chromatography of nuclear extracts on heparin-agarose, DEAE-sepharose, and DNAaffinity resins containing multiple copies of the HIV-1 LBPl binding site. Purified LBPl migrates as a 63kDa peptide in SDS-gels and was used in DNA-footprinting and gel-shift assays to identify recognition sites in well characterized cellular and viral genes and possibly elucidate a functional role for this factor.

Upon transfaion of cat fibroblasts, the levels of HBVsAg in the tissue culture was not detectable, due to the N-terminal fusion of the polyprotein produced which blocks the secretion. However if this plasmid was cotransfected with a plasmid carring the protease coding region, HBVsAg was observed. When the substrate plasmid was introduced in FeLV infected cat cells, HBVsAg was also detectable. Immunoblotting, using antibodies against HBVsAg, confirmed the proteolytic cleavage.To test if the murine retrovirus can recognize feline Gag as substrate, murine fibroblasts infected with the virus LP-BMS were transfected with pCag-IIIIV and the results clearly showed that the viral protease is able to process FeLV Gag. During analysis of the cfl'ects of inhibitors of HIV-1 protease,an intracellular accumulation of Gag-HBV was observed. These studies show this syslem to be of potential use for testing compounds that may inhibit retroviral proteinases. Attempts to apply this work to the evaluation of proteinase inhibitors i n vivo are under way.",

We have developed an automated solid phase PCR technique which allowes for colorimemc detection and subsequently sequencing of positive samples. This approach makes it possible to perform epidemiological and drug response studies without the need of time consuming cloning procedures. The biotin sueptavidin system was used to capture the amplified fragment on magnetic solid support. The amplified material was subsequently detected using a fusion protein 1ucIlucZ (Fig) . The entire procedure can be performed within a working day. By using a direct genomic sequencing method (no cloning or subcloning) the problems with Taq misincorporation is o---avoided. Results will be presented on solid phase sequence of the envelope (the V3 domain) and R T gene of HIV-I of virus isolates from several patients. The human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) genome encodes a regulatory gene (tat) which is required for viral gene expression and replication. Strain-specific changes in the tat gene product may contribute to differing levels of LTR-driven gene expression. To study the tat activity of different HIV-2 strains, RNA was isolated from HIV-2 infected tissue culture cells and the tat cDNA amplified using the polymerase chain reaction procedure. Two species of tat cDNA were isolated from HIV-2Rod RNA (Genebank accession M15390); one message with the expected coding sequence and one species with an altered splice junction between exons 2 and 3 . This alteration resulted in an insertion of four amino acids. This clone also has a single base deletion which alters amino acids 91-99. These tat cDNA's were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pSV2-neo, and cotransfected into RD Mechanisms of action f o r this role have not been elucidated. We have been investigating a recently described human ERS (HRES) with significant homology to both HTLV-1 and Hrab4, a ras-related gene, and have assessed the representation of this sequence in the genome, its similarities to other sequences, and its transcriptional state. Southern blots of numerous cell lines were probed with restriction fragments and PCR products to define regions of HRES which were represented more than once in the genome. While there is a great degree of structural overlap between HRES and Hrab4, they are separate genes, implying a potential gene duplication. Possible significance of this duplication will be discussed. To determine whether HRES was transcribed, Northern blots were probed with an RNA sequence homologous to the coding strand of HRES. Transcripts of different molecular weights were detected. To insure that these transcripts were derived from the same gene, the RNA sequence was used to probe the Southern blots. The transcripts from HRES and Hrab4 were distinct. Investigation is ongoing to clarify a role for HRES in immunologic disease. Bovine lentivirus, known as bovine immunodeficiency-like virus (BIV), is genetically, structurally, and antigenically related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This causes concern because humans consume beef and dairy products and fetal bovine serum is a component of most vaccines prepared in cell cultures. proteins cause human sera to either become HIV seropositive or display indeterminate antibody (Aby) reaction on HIV tests. We developed and used a BIV Western blot (WB) to examine sera from people \"at risk\" for BIV exposure and found no evidence of seroconversion to BIVspecific proteins. positive (4), Aby negative ( 4 ) , or indeterminate (16). None of these sera were positive by WB to BIV-specific proteins. Many of these sera, however, displayed a strong reactivity to both mock-infected and BIV-infected bovine cell culture antigens. samples of fetal bovine serum, each sample representing serum pooled from 1 -3 fetuses. All samples were negative on BIV WB. This agrees with our observation that calves born to BIVinfected, Aby-positive cows are negative for detectable BIV Aby at birth. To date, we have not detected any human Aby response to BIV-specific proteins. Aby response to BIV proteins is not a source of positive or indeterminate results on HIV WB.

One oncogenic mutant, a change of an arginine to a histidine at residue 175, was found to be dominant to the wildtype allele, thus providing direct evidence for dominant negative alleles of p53. The SV40 large T (Tumor) antigen is a multifunctional protein essential for the expression and replication of the viral genome. To initiate DNA replication, T must be phosphorylated at threonine-124, but the protein has to be dephosphorylated at serine sites. Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) dephosphorylates T at these serine sites and enhances the ability of T to support DNA replication. SV40 small t-antigen intexacts with Pp2A by binding to the regulatory subunit. This observation suggested to us that the interaction of small t with PP2A might modulate T-mediated DNA replication. To test this hypothesis, we used an in vitro DNA replication system which included an Hela cell extract, and as substrate the plasmid pZ189 (which contains the SV40 replication origin).

Our results indicate that small t inhibits DNA replication in vitro, and that this inhibitory effect may be mediated by the interaction of small t with PP2A. We have been studying the ability of a serics of SV40 T antigen mutants to immortalize primary mouse cmbryo fibroblasts, to transform established rodent cell lines, to transactivate gene expression from various promoters in monkey kidney cells, and to bind the tumor supressor gene products, p53 and Rb. We found that transactivation activity was reduced by mutations within the first 85 amino acids and that 40% of wildtype activity was retained by an N-terminal fragment of 138 amino acids. Some mutants with defects in origin-specific binding were completely defective for trans-activation. The data suggest that trans-activation is a function of the first 85-100 amino acids of large T. that the structure and orientation of this domain are essential for it to activate gene expression. Mutations at distal sites that reduce trans-activation could do so by altering the conformation of T antigen. We found no correlation between transactivation and immortalization, transformation, R b binding or p53 binding. Most of T antigen was required for transformation of REF-52 cells and immortalization of primary MEFs. Small insertions or deletions at many sites had no effect on either of these activities, but two mutants, with insertions at amino acid 409 and 424, were dcfective for both activities, even though both mutants retained the ability to bind Rb and p53. was defective for both immortalization of primary MEFs and transformation of REF-52 cells.

Although a single E2P site was activated in response to E2, txe presence of two or more E2Ps resulted in synergistic (rather than additive) cooperative activation. We have therefore designed experiments to determine the contribution of E2 domains to cooperative activation, and to test whether the E2 protein cooperates with cellular factors. The 410 AA E2 rotein has a tripartite structure: a C-terminal DNA bindin /dimerization domain (DBD), an $terminal transcription activation domain (TAD), and a centraf \"hinge\" domain of -100 AA. Cotransfection experiments using E2 mutants indicated that the central \"hinge\" facilitates synergistic cooperation between E2P sites located at a distance from each other. To determine whether synergistic cooperation was limited to, and therefore a special function of the E2 transcription activation domain, we have tested the E2 protein for coo eration with cellular factors. The E2 activation domain was found to coo erate synergistically with t i e AP-1 complex of Jun/Fos and with a chimeric cJun TAD/GHF-1 D B g construction. Synergistic cooperation is thus not limited to multiple E2 dimers: the TAD of E2 can cooperate with those of cellular factors. Coexpression of the N-terminal acidic helix domains of E2 or cJun interfered with transactivation of either AP-1 or E2P sites by their cognate factors.

It has been shown previously that the E6 proteins of high risk HPV types (HPV-16, 18) form a stable complex with p53 in vitro, and that complex formation can lead to targeted degradation of p53 in an ATP and ubquitin-dependent reaction. Recent experiments have demonstrated that an additional cellular factor is required for E6-p53 complex formation. This factor forms a stable complex with HPV-16 or 18 E6 in the absence of p53, but not with p53 in the absence of \u20ac6. The factor is being purified from reticulocyte lysate, which contains large amounts of this factor. A bacterially produced HPV-I 6 \u20ac6 protein has been utilized for affinity purification of the factor. Additionally, ubiquitin affinity chromatography has been used to fractionate the enzymes involved in the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis sytem in order to determine if the factor is directly involved in this system. We have molecularly cloned the HPV16 E7 gene into a bacterial expression vector driven by a thermoinducible bacteriophage lambda p~ promoter. Expression of the plasmid, designated p16E7, at permissive temperatures in E. coli resulted in an induced protein of approximately 15 kd. This 15 kd protein reacted with a monoclonal antibody to HPV16 E7 in Western blot analysis.

Mutations were made in sites conserved between E l and the SV40 large T antigen. Mutations between amino acids 100 and 113 have defined the boundaries of the nuclear localization signal for the E l protein as assayed by expressing mutant proteins from a heterologous promoter. We are presently testing the ability of the mutations to interfere with viral DNA replication when built back into the BPV genome. This region also contains a threonine analogous to Thr 124 in SV40 T Ag whose phosphorylation regulates the replication functions of T Ag. We are analyzing mutants at the coresponding Thr in E l to determine if it is phosphorylated and plays a similar regulatory role for BPV replication. Mutations in other regions of the protein are being used to analyze enzymatic activities of E l such as ATP hydrolysis. Interferons ( IFNs) exert potent effects on cellular physiology, including an inhibition of cellular proliferation, by aanscriptional activation of a set of genes in target cells. The molecular mechanisms for gene activation by IFNa have been well studied. IFNa binds to its cell surface receptor and activates one subunit (ISGF3a) of a mutimeric transcriptional activator (ISGF3). Following activation, ISGF3a translocates to the nucleus and forms a complex with the DNA-binding subunit of ISGF3 (designated ISGF3y). ISGF3 binds a specific promoter element (ISRE) in the regulatory region of the IFNa-stimulated genes and increases the transcription of these genes from undetectable to very abundant. This transcriptional activation is rapid and occurs independent of protein synthesis. Previous studies have demonstrated that adenovirus Ela protein can block the transcriptional stimulation of genes by IFNa. It is specifically the 12s form of Ela which causes this repression. We are investigating the effects of Ela on the localization, abundance, and activation of the subunits of ISGF3. In addition, the domains of the 12s Ela protein necessary for disruption of the IFN signal pathway are being defied by viral mutants of Ela. The E2 open reading frame (ORF) of BPV-1 is capable of encoding at least three polypeptides with transcriptional regulatory properties. The entire E2 ORF encodes a 410 amino acid protein that functions as a transcriptional transactivator and the 3' half of the ORF has been shown to encode two smaller polypeptides that repress E2-mediated transactivation. All three E2 proteins share a common carboxyterminal domain that encodes a specific DNA binding function and which contains sequences which promote E2 dimer formation. An amino terminal domain, which is unique to the full-length transactivator polypeptide, encodes the transcriptional activation function.",

            "text": "We have recently demonstrated that the BPV-1 E2 polypeptides are phosphorylated primarily on two serine residues at a site adjacent to the carboxy-terminal DNA binding domain, which is common to all three E2 proteins (McBride et a/., 1989. J.Virol. 63: 5076). These serine residues, at amino acid positions 298 and 301, were substituted with alanine residues and the mutated E2 ORFs substituted in the entire BPV-1 genome. The mutated BPV-I genomes were transfected into rodent cell lines and assayed for focus formation, viral gene expression and extrachromosomal viral DNA replication. The mutated viruses were able to transform C127 cells with wild-type efficiency. However, the viral genome containing the serine to alanine substitution at position 301 of the E2 polypeptide is present at very high copy number within these cells. The E7 proteins encoded by the human papillomaviruses (HPVs) associated with anogenital lesions share significant amino acid sequence homology with the Ad E1A proteins and the large T antigens of polyomaviruses. Each of these viral oncoproteins interacts with the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, pRB. Mutagenesis studies have shown that these conserved amino acid sequences are involved in binding pRB. The E7 proteins of the high risk HPV types 16 and 18 bind pRB with an affinity 5 to 10 fold higher than that of the E7 proteins of the low risk HPV types (HPV 6 and HPV 11). The biochemical and biological properties of a series of HPV-G/HPVlG E7 chimeric proteins were studied. The amino-terminal portion of the E7 protein determines the affinity to pRB, the ability to cooperate with an activated ras oncogene to transform baby rat kidney cells and the aberrant mobility of HPV-16 E7 on SDS polyacrylamide gels. Studies done in collaboration with J. A. Pietenpol and H. L. Moses (Vanderbilt University, Nashville TN) have revealed that this portion of the E7 sequence also governs the ability to abrogate the TGFp mediated repression of the c-myc promoter. The E7 proteins of the high risk and the low risk HPVs were able to transactivate the Ad E2 promoter with similar efficiencies indicating that this property must be mediated by a different mechanism. Minute virus of mice (MVM) is an autonomous parvovirus, one of a group of small single-stranded DNA viruses that are pathogenic for many vertebrate species, including man, and exhibit teratogenic, immunosuppressive, and tumor suppressive activity in vivo.",

Div of Virology, Burroughs Wellcome Co., RTP, N.C. 27709', HHMI Duke Univ Med Ctr, Durham, N.C. 27710' and LTVB, NCI, Bethesda, Md. 2089Z1. The E7 protein of the human papillomaviruses is a multifunctional oncoprotein encoding transforming and transcriptional functions and has substantial amino acid sequence similarity to Ad E1A (Phelps et a 1 . u 53:539). The transcriptional activating function of E7 has been demonstrated using the Ad E2 promoter and recent analysis of a series of E2 promoter mutants reveals that the same sequences are required for activation by E7 and E1A. Despite these similarities, other promoters known to be E1A responsive are not activated by E7 including the Ad E3, Ad E4 and the HSP70 promoters: moreover, the amino acid sequences in E7 critical for transactivation of the E2 promoter do not include sequences homologous to the previously defined trans-activating domain 3 of E1A. Recent experiments suggest that the 125 E1A product independent of domain 3 , can activate the E2 promoter: however, neither the E3 nor E4 promoters is activated, similar to results with E7. Finally, biochemical studies have suggested a mechanism for this activation that involves the ability of E1A to dissociate complexes involving the E2F factor (Bagchi et al., Cell 62:659). We now find that the E7 protein can biochemically mimic the activity of the 125 E1A product. The transforming functions of adenovirus-5 E l a have been mapped to two regions which are highly conserved among Ela proteins (CR1 and CR2). CR2 is involved in binding to the product of the \"recessive oncogene\" Rb, and this feature is shared with transforming proteins of several other DNA viruses. 'The function of CR1 is less well characterized, although it appears to have a major role in trans-repression of transcription and also shows strnctural homology to papovavirus and papilloma virus transforming proteins. Although release of a block to cell replication via Rb binding can account for part of its oncogenic potential, other biological effects of E l a are similar to those produced by \"dominant\" oncogenes such as niyc. In order to investigate the relationship between E l a and rnyc transforming activities, we constructed Elalmyc chimeras to ask whether essential transforming domains of E l a could complement rnyc transforming domains. We found that the N-terminal domain of E l a could complement the C-terminal domain of vrnyc for immortalization of primary REFs and collaboration with EJ ras. Chimcras constructed using domains from transformation-defective mutants of either E l a (eg. ACRl) or rnyc were inactive, suggesting that both domains contribute to the function of the chimera. The reciprocal recombinant (niyclEla) also imniortalized primary REFs and collaborated with EJ ras. We were unable to transform or immortalize REFs by complementation of Ela and rnyc domains in trans, although this could reflect either a strict requirement for complementation in cis or inefficiency in transfection or trans-complementation. Although work by other groups has shown that any functional similarity between E l a and iiiyc probably is not due to any strnctural \"homology\", o w experiments with Elalrnyc chimeras sug gect that part of the transformation potential of Ela may arise through mimicry of nyc functions. Human papillomavirus type 6 (HPV 6 ) is the cause of the most prevalent viral sexually Abigail Farr, and He Wang, Department of Microbiology and Immunology and The transmitted disease, condyloma acuminata (genital warts). Such lesions are characterized by a) a change in viral gene expression as the target cell, the keratinocyte, differentiates, and b) increased cellular proliferation. We have been investigating both of these aspects using HPV6-W50, an HPV 6 genome cloned from a condyloma and verified to be an authentic representative of the genome present in the tissue. The entire long control region, LCR, of the genome and subfragments thereof have been cloned into pSVEcat, an enhancerless plasmid that contains the cat gene driven by the SV40 early promoter. Experiments in HeLa cells indicate that both silencer and enhancer elements are located in the LCR. Silencer activity is detected as the ability of a subfragment of the LCR, when inserted into pSVEcat, to decrease expression of CAT activity, and as an increase in CAT expression when this subfragment is removed from the entire LCR. The silencer activity is also detected in undifferentiated keratinocytes. Insertion of the silencer into pSV2cat, a plasmid containing the SV40 enhancer and promoter upstream of the cat gene, decreases CAT activity in both HeLa cells and keratinocytes. We propose that interactions with this silencer may change during cellular differentiation altering viral transcription and/or replication. In a second biological assay, the HPV6-W50 genome alone is sufficient to stimulate rat embryo fibroblast colony formation. Insertion of stop codons into individual viral open reading frames suggests that more than one gene is capable of stimulating cellular proliferation.",

            "text": "Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892. The HPV-16 9 7 promoter directs the transcription of the viral E6 and E7 transforming genes. In primary human epithelial cells, the BPV-1 E2 gene product can act as a transcriptional repressor of this promoter through interactions with E2 binding sites in the viral regulatory region. The mutation of the E2 binding site proximal to the 9 7 promoter relieves that repression, and the mutation of an additional binding site results in the transcriptional transactivation of the promoter (J. Virol.64: 2849, 1990) . In order to assess the effect of HPV-16 E2 in the context of the full viral genome, mutations were created either in the E2 binding sites upstream of the P97 promoter or in the E2 gene itself. These mutants were then examined in a quantitative primary human epithelial cell immortalization assay. Mutations of E2 or of its cognate sites adjacent to the P97 promoter resulted in an increase in the immortalization capacity of the HPV-16 genome, confirming that E2 repression of the P97 promoter occurs in vivo. We have also determined that the disruption of the El ORF of HPV-16 results in an increased immortalization efficiency. The effect of El and E2 mutations on DNA copy number and viral transforming gene expression are being examined. Overexpression 01 the E5 and E6 ORF alone, but not the E2 ORF. results in translormation in vitro. E2 ORF encodes a set of transcription faclors which interacl with the BPV-1 enhancer to regulate expression of the BPV-1 early genes. Although in vitro experiments failed to prove a direct involvment of E2 in BPV-1 transformation of cultured cells, the E2 proteins, as transcription factors, have a potential to perturb expression of cellular genes and may act synergistically with the E5 and E6 oncogenes to effect cellular transformation and tumrigenesis.",

Adenovirus-based vectors containing the C gene or the mutated derivatives were transiently expressed in human cells and the C gene relatcd products analyzed by immunoprecipitation. The results show that the HBeAg secretion is dependent of the presence of a sequence of 15 amino acids located in the arginine-rich domain. These results suggest that this squence could contain a soning signal allowing the entry of HBeAg in secretory vesicles. We have also studied the influence of this sequence on the secretion of normally nonsecreted reporter gene products. . 9 (1990) 379-384) was applied to the functional test of MV matrix (M) genes cloned from brain cell RNA of patients w h o died of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). The functional M gene of the full length MV cDNA was exchanged with the M genes o f four SSPE cases. One of the genes tested gave rise to infectious virus, whereas only the first halves of the other three genes were functional. These results demonstrate that M gene inactivation is not obligatorily correlated with SSPE development. We are currently applying the same experimental approach to the functional test of F protein intracellular domains, which are often altered in SSPE cases.",

            "text": "Three other lines of research are in progress. First, to define the sequence requirements for paramyxoviral RNA editing, full length MV cDNAs mutated in the canonical mRNA editing signal were constructed, and will be tested for production of infectious virus. Second, preliminary results indicate that two full length MV cDNAs containing the framework for an additional (seventh) gene in the form of a duplication of an MV intercistronic sequence and additional unique restriction sites, produce infectious virus. Third, we are trying to substitute the MV persistently infected cells used t o provide helper function with cells transiently expressing only those MV proteins directly involved in replication or transcription. To locate sites modifying virulence in the enterovirus coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), we generated recombinants of the 5'NTR and capsid encoding regions of cardiovirulent and attenuated CVB3 strains. Inoculation of C3H/HeJ weanling mice has demonstrated that an important site of CVB3induced murine cardiovirulence resides downstream of the 5'NTR. Intertypic recombinants with portions of the poliovirus 1 (PV1) 5'NTR substituted for that of CVB3 has shown that substitution of less than the entire 5'NTR can reduce the ability of the recombinant to replicate but that recombinants with the entire 5'NTR of PV1 are as viable as the parental CVB3 in HeLa cell culture. However, the replication of this PVl:CVB3 recombinant in C3H/HeJ mice is reduced compared the CVB3 progenitor. Substitution of a 3' region of PV1 (with part of the replicase encoding region and the 3'NTR) for the corresponding region of CVB3 severely attenuates replication of the recombinant in HeLa cell culture. Replication of this recombinant increases when 5'NTR sequences are from PV1 as well. The essential determinant of attenuation in the genome of Sabin live oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) is the presence of uridine at position 472 rather than cytidine characteristic of wild type virus. Using a new highly sensitive method we have found that all lots of type 3 OPV contain some amount of C at position 472. The amount of 472-C was increased in lots which failed intraspinal neurovirulence test in monkeys. Passaging of type 3 OPV in vitro led to rapid accumulation of these mutants at a rate dependent on cell type and infection conditions. There were no changes at the position 2034 previously implicated in increased neurovirulence of some virus isolates or at several other positions which were reportedly changed in vaccine lots that failed monkey neurovirulence test. Our data emphasize the significance of the position 472 for the neurovirulence of type 3 OPV in the monkeys and suggest the use of this approach for evaluation of OPV lots and finding optimal conditions for manufacturing of safer vaccines. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are members of the picornavirus family and are the major causative agent of the common cold. Previous studies have demonstrated that 91 of the 102 known serotypes require a single cellular receptor, identified as the adhesion ligand ICAM-1, for attachment and subsequent infection. ICAM-1, which interacts with LFA-1 in the execution of immunological and inflammatory functions, is predicted to have 5 immunoglobulin-like domains. Using an in vitro transcriptionftranslation system, we have previously mapped the binding site of three MAbs that block virus attachment to the first 82 amino acid residues (domain 1) of ICAM-1. However, no virus binding was detected using the in vitro synthesized ICAM-1 fragments. sylation appears to play a role in virus binding since native deglycosylated receptor purified from HeLa cells also failed to bind virus. In order to study virus binding, we expressed modified ICAM-1 molecules in CEF cells using a RSV vector. Removal of each of the 4 glycosylation sites in domain 2 failed to compromise virus binding. To further map the region(s) of ICAM-1 required for virus binding, a synthetic gene was constructed that inserts 29 additional restriction sites into domains 1 & 2. Mutagenesis studies using the synthetic gene are in progress using the RSV expression system. An infectious, full-length, poliovirus cDNA clone was placed under control of the GAL1 0 promoter and transformed into yeast. Expression of the cDNA by growth on galactose resulted in production of a poliovirus-specific mRNA, but did not result in altered growth characteristics of the yeast. In fact, we find that yeast are unable to translate poliovirus RNA and that this effect is a consequence of the poliovirus 5-untranslated region (UTR). In cell-free translation assays, an activity present in yeast extracts inhibits the ability of HeLa extracts to translate RNAs containing the 5-UTR. This activity is concentration dependent and can be fractionated over DEAE Sephacel columns. These results suggest that yeast contain a translational inhibitor which does not allow efficient internal initiation of translation as mediated by the 5'-UTR of poliovirus RNA. Virus strains of the same serotype differ with regard to their ability to induce the lesions even though these tissues characteristically support luxuriant virus replication. Because the development of lesions in these zymogen organs is associated with the release of proteolytic enzyme autodigestion, the pathological process is triggered by an unidentified event. In our studies, CD8 and CD4 lymphocytes were depleted by the intraperitoneal inoculation of Mab before infection of adult male A/J mice with an encephalotropic strain of the encephalomyocarditis virus. Elimination of the CD4 cells prevented the development of lesions in the zymogen organs and reduced the severity of the associated encephalomyelopathy without dramatically affecting virus replication. Since disease in these animals develops 3-5 days after the inoculation of virus, traditional autoimmune processes would not appear to play an important role in the development of the disease. Accordingly, our research has focused on the question -what role do CD4 cells play in the pathogenesis of the infection and the development of lesions in target organs? The possible mechanism involved will be considered in this presentation.

Transfection of SV40-immortalized non-tumorigenic fetal mouse hepatocytes (FMH202) with cloned dimeric HBV DNA results in highly tumorigenic hepatocyte clones while FMH cells transfected only by the selection marker remain non-tumorigenic (EMBO J 9:1137). Transfection of permanent mouse fibroblasts which do not contain SV40 T antigen (NIH 3T3 and LTK') by dimeric HBV DNA generates also clones with increased growth efficiency in soft agar. Transfection with an HBV DNA fragment containing enhancer I and X gene generates also FMH clones which grow in soft agar and induce nude mouse tumors, if the clones express much 17 kD X protein. Although the X clones express more X protein than the HBV clones, they do not grow as efficiently in soft agar and have a longer latency period before tumor development. X transfected 3T3 clones grow also significantly better than transfected control clones, but again not as good as the HBV transfectants. The data suggest that X protein of HBV is a viral oncogene -at least in vitro-but further factor@) of HBV contribute probably to oncogenicity. The nude mouse tumors of HBV transfected FMH clones showed constitutive expression of c-fos, induction of endogenous retrovid elements IAP and MoMLV and rearrangements of the integrated HBV DNA. X protein was found to transactivate the serum response element of the c-fos promoter in these cells. Such a transcription element is also found in the LTR's of retroviral element IAP and of MoMLV. Possibly, X protein initiates increased transcription of cellular protooncogenes and furthermore rearrangements by endogenous retrotransposons. To further study the structural requirements of the hydrophobic region of 3AB, we made a number of amino acid replacement, deletion, and insertion mutants aimed at decreasing its hydrophobic character. Changes of Thr-67 to Arg or Lys, change of Gly-74 to Glu, and mutants containing both amino acid changes resulted in non-viable clones, primarily due to an RNA synthesis defect. This defect could not be complemented by a polio-coxsackie recombinant virus, suggesting a cis acting function directed by this domain. More dramatic changes including the insertion of 9 hydrophobic amino acids between residues 80 and 81 and the deletion of residues 72 to 80 also resulted in non-viable cDNAs. These mutants have been further analyzed by in vino translation of RNA transcripts of the mutated clones in the presence of microsomal membranes to evaluate the association of the mutated polypeptides with membranes. Our results suggest a correlation between the hydrophobic character of polypeptide 3AB and its role in poliovirus RNA synthesis. Virus infected target cells express newly synthesized viral antigens which can associate with class I MHC molecules and sensitize these cells for lysis by specific cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). Antigens processed by this \"endogenous\" pathway appear to be generated by the cleavage of viral proteins into small peptides which can then associate with class I MHC molecules and be transported to the cell surface. In order to determine whether the position of an epitope within the native viral protein is important for antigen processing by the endogenous pathway, we have generated several hemagglutinin (HA) mutants of the influenza virus A/JAP/305/57 in which one immunodominant HA epitope (amino acid residues 202-221) has been repositioned within the HA protein.",

The mutant HA gene was then inserted into a vaccinia virus expression vector and recombinant viruses were produced. Recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the altered HA protein were used to sensitize target cells for lysis by specific CTZ clones in a standard 51Cr release assay. We found that all six classes of mutant viruses were able to sensitize target cells as efficiently as wild type influenza virus for lysis by speciftc CTL clones. These data suggest that residues flanking antigenic site recognized by class I MHC restricted T cells do not influence the processing of the newly synthesized antigen and the presentation of the processed antigen fragment to T cells. We are also examining the role of individual amino acid residues for the presentation of the epitope to T cells by expressing the minigene encoding the antigenic moeity inside the cytoplasm. HCV is a major etiological agent of non-A, non-B hepatitis worldwide. The molecular cloning of the virus and determination of the complete primary structure of the viral polyprotein revealed that HCV is related to human flavi-and animal pestiviruses and more distantly to plant poly-and carmovimses. We have determined the nucleotide sequence at the extreme 5'-and 3'-termini of the HCV genome. Our analyses of these sequences show: 1) The nucleotide sequence in the 5'-untranslated region is highly conserved among HCV isolates collected from five continents. This suggests tat there is a strong evolutionary constrain operating on this sequence, indicating a likely role for this sequence in viral replication. 2) Within this region there are blocks of nt sequence homology with pestiviruses, but not with other viruses. 3) The relative position of short ORFs present the 5'-untranslated region of the HCV genome is similar to that of the pestiviral genome. 4) In vitro translation of viral RNA is inefficient unless these ORFs are removed, indicating that the 5'-unstranslation region is inhibitory for translation. 5) RNAs truncated at both the 5'-and 3'-ends are found suggesting the presence of both subgenomic mRNA and defective viruses. 6 ) Poly A tails are present at multiple sites on 3-subgenomic RNAs. These data differentiate HCV from the flaviviruses and HCV appears to be substantially different from other known pestiviruses. These data are consistent with the assignment of HCV to a separate viral genus. Our data provide new insights into the organization of the HCV genome, that may have important ramifications regarding the replication strategy and evolution of the virus. ",

Institute of Virology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria Seven variants of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus were selected by the use of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). These mutants did not bind the selecting MAb and differed from the wild type sequence by only single amino acid substitutions, which were located at different sites in the envelope protein E of TEE virus. The mutants were compared with respect to their virulence characteristics in the mouse model. One of the mutants, which had an amino acid substitution from tyrosine to histidine at residue number 384, revealed a strongly reduced pathogenicity after peripheral inoculation of adult mice, but retained its capacity to replicate in the mice and to induce a high titered antibody response. Infection with the attenuated mutant resulted in resistance to challenge with virulent virus. Comparison of nonconservative amino acid substitutions present in other attenuated flaviviruses provided evidence that a structural element including residue 384 is an important determinant of flavivirus virulence in general. Biology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 All picomaviruses generate their functional proteins by proteolytic processing of a large polyprotein which represents the single primary translation product of the viral genome. The cleavage pattern of the HAV polyprotein has been predicted by computer-assisted amino acid sequence alignments, but no viral proteins other than capsid proteins have been observed in infected cells, most likely due to slow HAV replication cycles and failure to inhibit host cell protein synthesis. Thus, no viral protease activities or cleavage sites in viral precursor proteins have been identified. We have utilized cell-free translation of 'I7 RNA polymerase transcripts of HAV cDNAs representing various portions of the P3 region to study the protease activity of the 3C region. Comparison of the mobilities of the translation products on SDS-PAGE, pulse-chase analyses of the various products and immunoprecipitation of the translation products with antisera specific for 2C, 3C and 3D proteins demonstrated that a 2C3ABCD precursor is first cleaved at the 2U3A junction, and this is most likely an autocatalytic, cis cleavage. Mutational analyses confmed that 3C sequences were responsible for the observed cleavages, and showed that the C-terminal region of 3C is important for protease activity. .5-kb RNA genomes differ at 12 nucleotide positions: 1 in the 5'-noncoding region (5'-NC), 1 each in nsP2 and nsP3 nonstructural protein genes, 6 (one silent) and 2 (one silent) in the E2 and El envelope glycoprotein genes, respectively, and 1 in the 3'-noncoding region. We have constructed a fullycharacterized, full-length cDNA clone of VEE TC-83 virus in the polylinker site of plasmid pUC18. Subsequently, TRD-specific cDNA regions were spliced into the TC-83 cDNA clone backbone to construct 18 TC-831TRD recombinant clones. Recombinant viruses derived by transfection of BHK-21 cells with genomic RNA transcribed from linearized plasmid were tested for virulence in mice. The genetic virulence factor in the TRDITC-83 virus pair is a constellation of genetic determinants dominated by the 5'-NC and a Thr-Val-Thr amino acid triad (TRD positions 120-192-296) in the E2 protein. E2 position 120 appears to be the most critical structural protein component of virulence. The TRD-specific 5'-NC appears to enhance the virulence potential of downstream TRD amino acid specificities.",

By sequencing the amplified products we are currently investigating which enteroviruses are involved. proteins. The precore protein contains the entire sequence of the core protein plus an amino-terminal extension of twenty-nine amino acids. This amino-terminal extension contains a signal sequence for the secretion of the precore protein. Translocation of the precore protein across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane results in the cleavage of the signal sequence and the production of the precore protein derivative named P22. We now demonstrate that both P22 and the core protein are phosphoproteins. Microsomal fractionation and trypsin digestion experiments demonstrate that, although a fraction of phosphorylated P22 is located in the ER lumen, a substantial portion of it is trypsin-sensitive indicative of a cytosolic localization. Phosphorylation appears to occur in the carboxy terminus of P22, since the P22 derivative, P16, which lacks the carboxy terminus of P22, is not phosphorylated. Linking the carboxy terminus of the precore/core protein to heterologous cytosolic and secretory proteins led to the phosphorylation of the resulting chimeric proteins. This result suggests that phosphorylation of P22 and core protein is mediated by cellular kinases. The F protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor F, which is cleaved by one or more host-cell proteases into the active form of the protein which consists of the disulfide-linked F, and F, subunits. The cleavage site of the SV5 F protein consists of five arginine residues and is cleaved by a ubiquitous protease (or proteases) that is present in all cell types examined so far. We have used a variety of approaches including the use of inhibitors of intracellular transport and cell fractionation, followed by analysis of the extent of post-translational modification of the F,, F, and F, polypeptides, in order to determine the subcellular compartment in which cleavage of the SV5 F protein takes place. The data suggest that the cleavage event occurs in the trans-Golgi network. Many studies have pointed to the possible coupling of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) transcription process to viral N S protein phosphorylation. We previously showed that at least two distinct protein kinase activities which remain bound to virion cores can phosphorylate the viral N S transcription factor in vitro (Beckes and Perrault, to be submitted). We show here that one of these ( V S V K I ) gives rise to the phosphorylated N S 1 species while the second (VSVK2) converts N S 1 to faster migrating species, collectively referred to here as N S 2 . Both kinases are active when virion cores transcribe their genome in vitro. However, N S I to N S 2 conversion is specifically inhibited by pre-treatment of virion cores with 5'-pfluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine (FSBA) with no effect on the transcription process. Likewise, addition of cell extracts inhibits the appearance of N S 2 without affecting transcription. The latter phenomenon is probably due to cellular phosphatases since extracts specifically remove phosphates from N S 2 following in vitro phosphorylation. We conclude that N S I to N S 2 conversion is not required concomitantly with the transcription process. The deoxyguanosine analogue, 2'-CDG, inhibits HBV replication by greater than 95% in the HBVproducing cell line, 2.2.15, as monitored by a decrease of secreted HBV DNA, HBV polymerase activity, and intracellular HBV DNA. Transcription of HBV RNA from chromosomally-integrated DNA was unaffected. The maximally effective concentration of 2-CDG was 2 2 0 ng/ml; 5 to 10 ng/ml produced = 50% inhibition; 5 2 ng/ml produced little detectable inhibition. Guanine is incorporated into both DNA and RNA from deoxyguanosine (dGuo) using the \"salvage\" pathway. Although the incorporation of guanine into DNA from 2'-CDG was several times that from dGuo, there was no detectable incorporation of guanine into RNA from 2'CDG.",

Virtually all of the analogue was present at internal sites within the DNA, and there was no detectable exchange of radioactivity into other DNA nucleotides. The data indicated that although 2'-CDG could be incorporated into cellular DNA, this entry was not through the \"salvage\" pathway, but rather by de novo phosphorylation.

Borna disease virus (BDV) causes a rare neurological disease in horses and sheep. The virus has not been classified since neither an infectious particle nor a specific nucleic acid had previously been identified. Recently, infection with a BDV-like agent has been associated with schizophrenia in humans. Antibodies to novel BDV-specific antigens were found in sera and CSF of such patients. To identify the genome of BDV a subtractive cDNA expression library was constructed with poly A selected RNA from a BDV infected MDCK cell line. A clone (Be) was isolated that specifically hybridized to RNA isolated from BDVinfected brain tissue and BDV infected cell lines. This clone hybridized to four BDVspecific positive strand RNAs (10.5, 3 . 6 , 2.1 and 0.85 kb) and one negative strand RNA (10.5 kb) in BDV-infected rat brain. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the clone suggested it represented a full length mRNA which contained several open reading frames. In vitro transcription and translation of the clone resulted in the synthesis of the 14 and 24 kD BDV-specific proteins. The 24 kD protein, when translated in vitro from the clone, was recognized by antibodies in the sera of patients (3/7) with behavioral disorders. This BDV-specific clone will provide the means to isolate the other BDV-specific nucleic acids, and identify the virus responsible for Borna disease. In addition, the significance of BDV or a BDV related virus as a human pathogen can now be more directly examined.",

CD4(178)-PE40 is a genetically engineered hybrid protein consisting of the HIV gpl20-binding region of human CD4 linked to the translocation and ADP-ribosylation domains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A. In previous experiments with human T-cell lines, we showed that the hybrid toxin kills HIV-I infected cells with high selectivity and potency, and inhibits HIV-1 spread. We now report that CD4(178)-PE40 selectively kills HIV-1 infected cell lines of the monocytehnacrophage lineage, and that it inhibits HIV-1 spread in primary T-cell and macrophage cultures. Furthermore, we observe strong synergistic activity between CD4( 178)-PE40 and reverse transcriptase inhibitors (AZT or ddl) in blocking HIV-1 spread. When both types of drugs are present in cultures of T-cell lines infected with HIV-1, virus spread is completely blocked, as judged by protection of the target cell population from virus-mediated killing and complete inhibition of virus production. When drug administration is terminated after an initial treatment period of several weeks, no infectious virus remains; quantitative PCR analysis indicates complete elimination of HIV DNA. The surviving population is CD4-positive and readily killed upon re-exposure to fresh HIV, indicating that the drug treatment does not merely select for HIV-resistant cells. We conclude that the combination treatment completely eliminates infectious HIV-1 from the culture. Control experiments indicate that these synergistic effects are due to selective killing of the HIV-infected cells by CD4(178)-PE40, rather than to a simple neutraliztion effect by the CD4 moiety of the hybrid toxin. These results highlight the potential value of therapeutic regimens involving combination of a virostatic drug which prevents infection of healthy susceptible cells in the population, plus an agent capable of killing those cells that are already infected. E.Norrby. Twentyfive 13 to 35 amino acids lonn peptides representing regions of human immunodeficiencv virus type 2 (HITT-?.), strain SBL6669, envelope proteins were evaluated for their immunogenic activity in guinea pigs. A number of the HIV-2 peptides were found to be capable of inducing strain SBL6669 neutralizing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) antibodies. TWO overlapping peptides covering the amino acid sequence 311-337 representing the central and carboxy terminal part of the V3 region showed the most pronounced capacity to induce neutralizing antibodies. Two additional regions in the gp 125 containing linear sites reacting with neutralizing antibodies were identified, aa 119-137 and 472-509. The transmembrane protein, gp 36, pf YIv-2 harbored two regions of importance for induction of neutralizing antibodies, aa 595-614 and 714-729. These findings pare the way for development of synthetic vaccines against HIV-2 and possibly also SIV infections. The capacity of such a product to induce protective immunity can be evaluated in macaque monkeys. Stanford, CA 94305. Very little is understood about the genetic control or mechanisms involved in CMV pathogenesis. The large 230 kilobase pair DNA genome of human and murine CMV encode over 200 gene products that regulate viral gene expression during viral growth as well as gene products presumably involved in virus/host interactions and latency. The murine CMV immediateearly gene 2 @2) encodes a 391 amino acid protein that is dispensable for growth in cell culture. In experimentally inoculated mice, k2deficient recombinant viruses do not exhibit significantly altered growth in target tissues such as the salivary gland, peritoneal cavity, liver, kidney, spleen, and lungs. We have recently demonstrated that the k2 gene product can function in transient gene expression assays as a transcriptional activator of the major immediate-early kl promoter as well as its own promoter. The murine and human CMV enhancer regions share many similar sequence motifs that may be important in the regulation of immediate-early gene expression. Preliminary results demonstrate that 1E2 can mediate transactivation through known human CMV enhancer repeat elements, suggesting that the murine CMV enhancer may be a target for IE2-mediated transactivation. Based on the predicted protein sequence, IE2 contains a putative leucine zipper and adjacent charged domains. A 4-3 repeat of hydrophobic residues occurs in this same region of the k2 sequence that may be important for formation of a coiled-coil structure. Interestingly, IE2 shares an overall amino acid similarity of 44% to Epstein-Barr virus BZLFI, a known transactivator of the EBV immediate-early promoters. IE2 also demonstrates 49% amino acid similarity to the bovine papillomavirus E2 transactivator as well as 47-5076 similarity to a HCMV protein family encoded for in the short (S) component of the viral genome, suggesting that these proteins may be functionally similar to MCMV IE2. Functional characterization of IE2 as a transactivating protein and murine and human CMV enhancer elements as targets for IE2-mediated transactivation should yield insights into murine CMV gene regulation and may be applicable to the overall understanding of human CMV pathogenesis. Wilcox and Johnson (1) have previously reported the infection in vino of primary fetal rat neurons with Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) under conditions that lead to viral latency. as defined by the following operational criteria : i) lack of expression of the viral gene products that are detectable during a productive infection. and ii) reactivation of the virus by specific stimuli. Transcriptional studies show that neurons harboring a latent infection in vino express the latency-associated transcript (LAT); however these cells do not produce transcripts from other viral genes until the virus is reactivated by nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation. Since viral expression restricted t o LAT transcription is widely accepted as a marker for latency, these data suggest that our system not only mimics latency at an operational level. but is relevant for mechanistic studies of latent infection by HSV-1.",

PCR technique allowed detection of the virus more than two weeks prior to all the other techniques applied. A decrease in the leukocyte, lymphocyte count and particularly the absolute number of CD4t-T-cells after HCMV detection was associated with the development o f symptomatic HCMV infection as observed in 26 patients.

Cellular transcription factors are likely to be important for this cell type specificity.

The LRS in NPC i s an 800 bp unrnethylated island, surrounded by extensive CpC methylation, in tumors where LMP-expression can be detected. It is completely methylated in LMP non-expressors.

Results obtained demonstrate that poliovirus chimaeras may have a role in HIV-1 epitope expression for diagnostic4 and vaccine development purposes. The promoter-proximal downstream sequences of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase I 1 have recently been recognized as containing transcriptional regulatory elements. I have identified and characterized a novel regulatory domain downstream from the human cytomegalovirus that is recognized at the DNA level. This regulatory domain was shown to enhance the number of functional initiation complexes without significantly altering the apparent elongation rate by RNA polymerase II transcription. I have constructed and analyzed a series of mutations in the first exon by in vivo and in vifro transcription assays. Run-off in vifro transcription and DNAbinding experiments (DNase I-footprinting and mobility shift assays) identified two downstream elements that specify the interaction of cellular transcription factors. One of these elements contains a reiterated sequence motif, present twice within exon I . The second element is an 18-bp sequence, located at approximately nucleotide position +33, that is conserved between species strains of CMV. The conserved element is recognized by two cellular nuclear proteins designated LTF A and B (for Leader Transcription Factor A and B) of 74 kDa and 50 kDa respectively as determined by photoactivated crosslinking. Screening a battery of different celltype nuclear extracts for LTF A and B activity suggests that these proteins are ubiquitous transcription factors. This study of promoter-proximal downstream transcriptional elements describes a unique DNA target regio n for regulating latency and reactivation of HCMV. Among potential cofactors, herpesviruses have received much attention because they are highly prevalent among HIV infected hosts. It was reported by us and others that HSV can activate HIVl gene expression, as determined by HIV LTR CAT expression and superinfection of acutely and chronically HIVl infected cell lines. The ACHZ cell line, derived from a chronically HIVl infected T lymphocytic line, CEM, produces few progeny virions, but is inducible to increase virion production by treatment with PMA and GM-CSF. Resting ACHZ cells have an aberrant pattern of viral RNA expression which is altered by treatment with phorbol esters to reproduce the RNA patterns of actively replicating virions. We have found that HIV expression dramatically increased following superinfection of ACH2 cells with HSV, as determined by a 10-fold rise in reverse transcriptase activity and p24 antigen expression. The HIV RNAs expressed in resting ACH2 cells consist mainly of subgenomic RNA species, with little or no genomic RNA. We found that within 12 hours of HSV superinfection, there was a dramatic rise in the 2 kilobase mRNA (encoding viral regulatory proteins), followed by a marked increase in the genomic mRNA. Such a shift of transcriptional phases recapitulates the early-to-late transition of the productive infection observed during a single step growth cycle of HIV and supports our previous observation that upregulation of HIVl expression occurs following HSV superinfection. These data also suggest that activation of HIVl by certain heterologous viruses occurs at the level of RNA expression. four months or the same treatment combined with four 2 week courses of interleukin 2 (IFN / 112) starting at week 3 of treatment. The interval between iL 2 courses was 2 weeks. IL 2 was given S.C. at 2.25 x 106 IU/m2 2 x per day for 2 days followed by 1.8 x 100 IU/m2/day for 12 days.

Severe local side effects (inflammatory reaction) occured only after lL2 opplication. The study shows that retreatment of patients with CAH-B previously unresponsive to IFN alpha was of low effectiveness. The addition of lL2 at the doses given and the schedule reported to IFN appeared to be of no benefit. We have developed a rapid, semiautomated amplified probe assay for HSV utilizing LCR technology. Traditional detection of HSV by virus culture and cytologic monitoring, which often take more than two days, has limited sensitivity, and depends on the presence of intact, culturable virus in test specimens. Our HSV LCR assay detects less than 100 HSV DNA molecules, and since the target region is short, the assay accommodates partially degraded specimens. A segment of the HSV genome approximately 50 bases in length is amplified by LCR and the product detected by an IMx@ microparticle immunoassay. Our HSV LCR system eliminates blunt-end ligation background, resulting in an extremely sensitive non-radioactive assay with excellent specificity. hours. Sensitivity compares favorably with that of PCR, and the HSV LCR assay readily discriminates HSVl from HSV2.",

Shope fibroma virus (SFV) is a tumorigenic leporipoxvirus which causes a localized benign fibroma in immunocompetent rabbits which regresses after two weeks due to a vigorous cell-mediated immune response. Malignant rabbit fibroma virus (MRV) and myxoma virus (MYX) are related tumorigenic leporipoxviruses which induce rapidly lethal systemic infections characterized by severe immunosuppression. Using a monoclonal antibody directed toward class I MHC proteins, we observe a rapid and specific decrease in the cell surface expression of class I MHC antigens in cell culture during infection with MRV or MYX. By 24 hours post infection, class I MHC antigens are nearly undetectable on the surface of infected cells. This downregulation requires late viral gene expression, and does not affect the cell surface levels of other glycoproteins, such as the transferrin receptor. Neither the benign SFV nor the orthopoxvirus vaccinia significantly decrease MHC antigen levels. An attenuated mutant of MYX, created by interuption of an ORF of unknown function designated as M-11, shows minininl downregulation of class I antigen expression. Therefore, decreases in cell surface class I MHC antigen expression during poxvirus infection correlate well with virus virulence. We are currently characterizing the nature of this downregulation at the genetic and molecular levels in order to assess the physiological relevance of these observations. Since many animal virus virulence factors act to attenuate host immune responses, these studies should further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying virus-induced immunopathology.",

Several open reading frames (ORF) were found in it. One of them (ORF3) overlaps with the IE gene in the opposite orientation. It is in the same region where latency-related transcripts in opposite polarity t o the IE gene were reported. There is a potential promoter (P2) upstream of ORF3 containing binding motifs for several transcription factors. Specific binding of nuclear proteins t o four S p l sites was detected. Promoter P1 is upstream of the IE gene and it contains a TATA-box, CCAAT motif, and S p l and NF-WE1 binding sites. Four closely associated NF-WE1 and oct-I motifs were found further upstream from P I . These upstream elements were essential for efficient expression of PRV IE gene in vivo. It also increases efficiency of the HSVl t k promoter. Two potential enhancer elements (E3, E4) were identified in the sequenced region by an enhancer trap experiment. Linked to P I , E3 acted as an enhancer and E 4 as a silencer. The PRV IE gene product repressed transcription from its own promoter and activated the SV40 early promoter.

HSV-1 gB is an envelope glycoprotein that is required for infectivity and promotes virion penetration into cells.

We selected a recombinant, RVCys-5, that failed to react with several monoclonal antibodies having virus-neutralizing activity. Analysis of this mutant showed that RVCys-5 forms plaques at the permissive temperature (37OC) but not at the nonpemissive temperature (39OC). This defect was overcome by treating the mutant-infected cells with polyethylene glycol. Analysis of the viral proteins made at 39OC in cells infected with a high multiplicity of RVCys-5 showed that synthesis of the major HSV-1 regulatory protein, 0.4, and the viral glycoproteins was comparable to that of the parental virus, with the exception of gB. Although the mutant gB formed stable dimers, they were partially glycosylated and remained sensitive to endoglycosidase H.

A bacterial expressed C-terminal fragment of EBNA-1 protein binds as a d m r to 24 high-affinity DNA binding sites in On-P and to two low-affinity sites in the BamH1-Q fragment in the EBV genome. Ba131 nuclease deletion analysis defined the minimal DNA-binding domain between amino acid 493 to amino acid 584. A potential DNA recognition motif from amino acid 513 to amino acid 533, and a protein dimerization function from amino acid 554 to amino acid 584 have been dissected out using site-directed mutagenesis. EBNA-1 binding to a consensus DNA binding site bends the DNA and induces structural changes in the protein that causes it to become resistent to proteinase-K digestion . These physical interactions of EBNA-1 with the DNA may play a direct role in DNA replication. We have used an in vitro mRNA decay system (Ross and Kobs, 1986, J. Mol. Biol., 188: 579-593) to analyze the mechanism by which HSV-1 destabilizes mRNAs. Polysomes from uninfected human erythroleukemia cells were used as a source of mRNA. These polysomes were mixed 1:l in cell-free reactions with either polysomes or post-polysomal supernatant (S 130) from HSV-1-or mock-infected murine erythroleukemia cells. Normally stable mRNAs such as y-globin were degraded rapidly with extracts from infected cells. S130 from cells exposed for only 15 min to wild-type virus caused a four-fold decrease in y-globin mRNA stability in vitro. In contrast, S 130 from vhsl-, vhs ASma-, or mock-infected cells did not destabilize y-globin mRNA. The stability of normally unstable mRNAs, such as histone and c-myc, was not accelerated by S130 from infected cells. No mRNA destabilizing activity was detected in polysomes from infected cells.

Buckheit, Jr., D. Adam Plier,and Cynthia Hayslette-Doggett Retrovirus Research Laboratory, Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL 35255 The pathogenesis of infection of human T cells by HIV-I is quite heterogeneous. This heterogeneity is in part derived from differences which exist among the various HIV isolates and in part from differences which exist among the various human cell lines. We have been examining differences in the capacity of a panel of cultured human T cell lines to be infected with HIV-1 in order to identify the viral and cellular factors which are important in HIV replication and pathogenesis. We have identified two CEM cell lines which are divergent in their ability to be infected with HIV. Both of these lines express equivalent levels of cell surface CD4 and grow at the same rate in cell culture. Upon infection with 100 TCID50 units of virus, the HIV-sensitive cell line (CEM-SS) exhibit massive syncytia formation, produce high levels of infectious virus and are completely killed within 7 days of infection. A resistant CEM cell line (CEM-CCRF) infected with the same quantity of infectious virus slowly becomes 100% infected over the course of 20-30 days. These cells exhibit low level syncytia formation and only a slight, transient decrease in cell viability (5-10%). Virus production in CEM-CCRF cells, as measured by supernatant reverse transcriptase and intracellular p24 antigen expression, is much lower at any given time post-infection. Following the acute infection period, the CEM-CCRF cell line becomes chronically infected and produces high levels of infectious virus. Inefficient infectahility is also observed upon cocultivation of the CEM-CCRF cell line with chronically infected, HIV-producing cells. In order to infect CEM-CCRF cells it requires 100 to 1000 fold greater numbers of infected cells than is observed for CEM-SS cells. We will present the results of our ongoing efforts to identify the viral and cellular factors responsible for differential infectivity of human cells.

M I 1 0 FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION OF HIV-1 INTEGRASE IN E. COLI: PROPERTIES AND SUBSTRATE REQUIREMENTS IN VITRO, Michael G. Cordingley, Pia L. Callahan and Robert LaFemina. Virus and Cell Biology, Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories, West Point, PA 19486 The integrase gene of HIV-1 was expressed in E. coli as the mature 32kD polypeptide (IN) but with a single additional N-terminal methionine residue. Purified recombinant IN protein was functional in vitro, exhibiting both endonuclease and integration functions. The Mnzf-dependent endonuclease activity cleaved 2 nucleotides from the 3 ' end of substrate oligonucleotides representing HIV-1 proviral termini but did not cleave heterologous retroviral termini. These oligonucleotides served as both substrates and targets for integration by IN since molecules characteristic of integration products were generated in these reactions. Recombinant IN protein specifically bound LTR termini and formed a stable complex with substrate oligonucleotides in gel mobility shift assays. Mutational analysis of the U5 LTR substrate has been utilized to locate critical residues for substrate binding and/or cleavage by HIV-1 IN in vitro. These results suggest that the IN protein is capable of mediating all steps of retroviral integration in the absence of other viral or cellular factors. The integrase gene of HIV-1 represents an attractive antiviral target. M 111 ALBERT G. DEE, DENNIS P. SMITH, TOM C. HASSELL, HANSEN M. HSIUNG, RICHARD M. VAN FRANK AND ME1 T.

Human-hamster hybrid cell clones with defined sets of human chromosomes were assayed by transient DNA transfection for support of HIV-1 and -2 and HTLV I LTR-CAT gene expression. Of 17 hybrid clonestested, the 4 hybrid clones with chromosome 12 showed the highest HIV-2 tat (tatz)-induced trans-activation of the HIV-2 LTR (LTRP). Trans-activation of the HTLV I LTR or HIV-1 LTR by the HTLV I trans-activator gene (taxl) was not increased by the presence of chromosome 12. Cells without chromosome 12 supported heterologous tat1 trans-activation of the HIV-2 LTR 4.7 to 5.7 fold higher than the homologous HIV-1 trans-activation; chromosome 12containing cells had a 0.9 to 3 . 4 fold increase in tat1 trans-activation of the HIV-2 LTR compared to the homologous HIV-1 trans-activation. Our results suggest that a complete heterologous trans-activation of the HIV-2 LTR may be supported by a combination of two o r more cellular mechanisms: the chromosome 12 pathway and an additional less efficient secondary mechanism. Furthermore, chromosome 12 supports a homologous HIV-1 and -2 transactivation mechanism but not a universal trans-activation mechanism for human retroviruses.HUMAN CHROMOSOME 12 IS REQUIRED FOR HOMOLOGOUS BUT NOT HETEROMGOUS TAT-TRANS-ACTIVATION OF THE HIV-1 & 2 LTR.

Human and slmlan lmmunodeflclency viruses (HlV/SIVs) contain a well-consewed open readlng frame (ORF) capable of encoding a 23-25 kDa protein designated the virion Infectivity factor (vlf; previously termed sor, A, Q, P, or ORF-1). In order to more thoroughly analyze the role of the vlf gene product In vlral repllcatlon, a series of biochemical and molecular studles were undertaken. Mutatlonal analysis of the HI V-2, , , vlf ORF resulted in the productlon of progeny virions that were slgnlflcantly lmpalred (100-1,000 X) In cell-free vlral transmission in a variety of CD4' lmmortallzed lymphocytlc cell lines (Sup-T1, H9, CEM, CEMx174), as well as In peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Western analysis of HI V-2, , Infected cell lysates utlllzlng antl-vlf polyclonal rabblt antlsera demonstrated the presence of two co-mlgrating forms of the proteln at 26 and 27 kDA, respectlvely. Western and radlolmmunoprecipltatlon analysls of sucrose gradlent purlfled HI V-2, , , virlons demonstrated that the vlf proteln Is not an integral vlrlon proteln. Electron mlcroscoplc analysis of vlf Infected cultures revealed the presence of morphologlcally normal vlrlons 100-120 nm In diameter wlth cyllndrlcal core structures, the presence of mature gp120-gp41 complexes on the vlrlon surface, and the ability of mature vlrlons to assemble and budd from the cytoplasmic membrane. Quantltatlve polymerase chaln reactlon (PCR) analysis of genomlc DNA extracted from different lmmortallzed lymphocytlc cultures and PBL followlng cellfree vlral transmlsslon demonstrated that vlf' vlruses were capable of lnltlatlng reverse transcrlptlon, complementary DNA synthesls, and completlon of full-length vlral DNA synthesls. Temporal quantltatlve PCR experlments between wlldtype and vlf mutants demonstrated equlvalent levels of vlral DNA at lhr, mlnlmal differences at 24 hr (3-8 X), and slgnlficant dlfferences at 48 hr (10-30 X).

HIV-1 strains differ greatly in their ability to infect macrophages. We have characterized two molecular clones which grow efficiently in macrophages. One, called pMN-STL, is derived from an early passage of HIV-1(MN). Although long established MN cultures do not grow in macrophages, MN-ST1 grows well in these cells. MN-ST1 varies very little from other clones of HIV-1(MN), suggesting that very slight differences can strongly influence cell tropism, and that macrophage tropic viruses are easily lost during passage in T cell lines. The second clone, pLW12.3, was derived from a laboratory worker (LW) accidentally infected with HIV-1 (HTLV-IIIB). The virus derived from the LW grew well in macrophages, in marked contrast to IIIB. The pLW12.3 clone was shown to have a small deletion of the carboxy terminus of vif and the amino terminus of u, and derived virus only grew in the SupTl T cell line. After adding the missing region using an analogous seqment from IIIB, the pLW12.3 grew well in macrophages, in spite of only minimal differences from the non-macrophage competent IIIB.

The Tax protein of HTLV-I is capable of activating both viral and cellular gene expression including IL-2 and IL-2 Ra. While Tax does not interact directly with target sequences, nanscripbnal activation by Tax may be mediated by interaction with host pteins.-The regulatory protein NFkB has been implicated in activation of IL-2Ra Tax. We have demonstrated the presence of a specific lymphoid factor, LkB-A, in a Tax expressing B-cell line necessary for activation of NFkB in this cell line.

Division of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and 'Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104We have compared the relative importance of transcription regulatory regions in the HIV LTR using linker-scanning mutational analysis. 26 mutant LTR-CAT plasmids were prepared where consecutive 18 bp regions of wild type LTR were replaces with an Nde I-Xho I-Sal I (NXS) polylinker. The mutant LTR-CAT plasmids were transfected into unstimulated, TPA/PHA-stimulated and tat-expressing Jurkat cells. Transcriptional activity was measured by analysis of CAT activity. The activity of many of the mutants was predictable, based on current knowledge of LTR regulatory elements. However, some of the mutants indicated additional regulatory sites. In addition, the fine structure analysis highlights differences in utilization of known regulatory regions, depending on the cellular conditions. We find that the NF-kB sites are necessary for transcription under all cellular conditions; however, there is a marked difference in the requirement for one or two sites comparing stimulated Jurkat cells with unstimulated or tat-expressing Jurkat cells. In all cases there is a dramatic decrease in activity with mutants that covered the TATA and Spl elements. Mutants on the 3'-side of the TATA element caused a more significant decrease in activity in tat-expressing Jurkat cells compared to the others. A significant regulatory region was indicated by linker scanning mutants between nucleotides -183 and -130. These mutations caused marked decreases in activity of the LTR in unstimulated and stimulated Jurkat cells but had no effect in tat-expressing Jurkat cells. Mutants within this region (-147 to -130) appeared to have a greater effect in the stimulated cells. DNA mobility shift studies using the mutants within this region indicated that the altered CAT activity corresponds to alterations in DNA factor binding. Quite modest evidence of negative regulatory regions (1.5 fold or less) appeared in the unstimulated Jurkat cells only. Overall, a comparison of the patterns of regulatory element utilization between the three cellular conditions shows not only expected similarities but also significant differences.M 147 \"SHINE-DELGARNO ' LIKE SEQUENCE INCREASED EXPRESSION OF RECOMBINANT HIV-1 INTEGRASE IN E.COLI BY OLIGONUCLEOTIDE DIRECTED MUTAGENISIS OF A Peter H.

This simple and variable promoter structure can account for T antigen's promiscuous activation of promoters. The SV40 late promoter, a primary target for T antigen transcriptional activation, fits this promoter structure. It contains a cluster of initiator elements (SV40 nucs. 250 to 335) downstream of a previously described element, the T antigenactivated binding site (TABS, SV40 nucs. 186 to 225), known to be necessary for the activation of the late promoter in the presence of T antigen. The TABS element functions as an upstream component of the promoter. It contains overlapping octamer (OCT) and SPH (or TEF-I) binding sites. We have found that the SPH binding sites are necessary for transcriptional activation by T antigen, while octamer factor binding mediates negative regulation of the late promoter. When Oct 1 is over-produced, it can eliminate T antigen mediated transcriptional activation of the late promoter. This suggests that one function of T antigen in transcriptional activation of the late promoter is to alter factor binding at the OCT/SPH region to favor binding of factors to the SPH sites.

The F'CR prima sets for EBV and HPV were designed according to the reported sequences of B95-8 strain of EBV and HPV type 16. respectively. The reaction condition was optimized for the primer sequences of both viruses. EBV sequences were detected in 24 of 50 specimens (48%) and HPV DNA sequences were detected in 15 of 50 samples (30%). The coexistence of EBV and HPV DNA sequences were detected in 1P of 50 specimens (20%). The significance of dual infection of EBV and HPV in those tumors will be discussed.

This strong repression is not mediated by simply lowering T-Ag mRNA levels, and therefore is not due to the previously describedtranscriptional repression activity of E1A. We have demonstrated the repression with both transient cotransfection assays and with viral infection or transfection of E1A expressing cell lines (DePolo et al., 1989, p. 239-53, in Common Mechanisms of Transformation by Small DNA Tumor Viruses, L.

DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER, ROCHESTER, N.Y. 14642. E7 is the major transforming gene of HPV 16 and 18. It can bind the retinoblastoma gene product (RB) through a region (2-37 amino acids), which has homology with the RB binding regions of adenovirus Ela and SV40 large T (LT). When certain amino acids in the region of RB binding are altered, the RB/E7 interaction is inhibited and E7, unlike the wild type protein, is unable to transform primary rat embryo fibroblasts in cooperation with an activated ras. However, these mutations in the background of the full length HPV 16 genome are able to immortalize human epithelial cells, the natural host cell.

Department of Microbiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, N.Y. 10032. Human papillomaviruses are readily typed on the basis of their segregation pattern with specific disease states. Recently, we identified and cloned HPV-51 from a benign condyloma. Molecular epidemiologic analysis of cervical lesions revealed that it was present in approximately 5% of all cases examined and that it was found in both cervical intraepithelial neoplasms and cancers. The complete nucleotide sequence of the genome of this isolate was determined and compared with other HPVs associated with the development of both benign and progressive lesions. Sequence analysis reveals a genome of 7808bp that is readily aligned with other HPVs and composed of eight major open reading frames which are all encoded by the same strand. The ORF encoding E6 has a potential zinc finger binding domain and the E7 ORF contains the amino acid sequence required for interaction with the Retinoblastoma gene product. Furthermore, HPV-51 as with other HPVs associated with anogenital cancer, and in contrast with those associated with benign condylomata possesses a splice donor and acceptor in E6 which would permit the synthesis of an E6* protein. These structural characteristics place HPV-51 with the oncogenic members of this family. Matrix homology comparisons show that HPV-51 is most closely related to HPV-31, a member of the highly oncogenic class of these viruses. Morphologic transformation experiments comparing this virus with HPVs 16 and 18 are currently underway to determine its oncogenic potential M 232 FIBROEPITHELIOMAS IN BPV-1 E2 TRANSGENIC MICE J.

Using this assay we have determined the gene requirement for viral DNA replication. Two viral polypeptides are necessary and sufficient for replication of BPV DNA in mouse C 127 cells. One of these polypeptides is a 72 kD phosphoprotein encoded from the entire E l open reading frame, and the other is the 48 kD E2 transcriptional trans activator. The sequences required in cis for replication are limited to a 105 nucleotide long fragment which is different than the previously characterized PMS sequences. The fragment contains two binding sites for the E2 transactivator, at least one of which is required for replication.The common requirements for the amplification and maintenance stages of viral DNA replication argue for a common mechanism of regulation for the two stages. We are currently investigating a copy number control system as responsible for the control of both stages of replication.M 235A 56 KILO-DALTON NUCLEAR PROTEIN INTERACTS WITH A PURINE-RICH DNA SEQUENCE TO NEGATIVELY REGULATE JC VIRUS LATE GENE EXPRESSION IN GLIAL CELLS.

Division of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Center of Biologics Evaluation and Research,FDA, Bethesda, MD 20892 At the 3' end of rubella virus (+) stranded RNA there is a 12bp inverted repeat which is capable of forming a stem-loop structure. This inverted repeat is present in the region of the RNA which is implicated to be involved in the replication of the virus. Sequence analysis of the inverted repeat showed that there is a putative TATA box surrounded by GC rich sequences. To examine whether this element has promoter activity, a 158bp DNA fragment corresponding to the 3 end of the rubella virus RNA, which includes the 12bp inverted repeat, was inserted into a series of CAT (Chloramphenicol Acetyl Transferase) expression vectors. The results demonstrated that, this element has promoter activity which is dependent upon the presence of the SV40 enhancer sequence in the vector. In addition, only the cells which were transformed with SV40 virus could initiate the transcription from this element. Primer extension analysis of the CAT mRNA showed that the transcription initiates 21 bp downstream from the TATA box. Experiments dealing with the deletions and point mutations of the promoter region are in progress to analyze the sequences which are necessary for the promoter function. DNA gel shift analysis of the promoter region is being performed to study the interaction of cellular and viral proteins which are involved in the initiation of transcription.

CA 92037 C3H/ST mice persistently infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) show abnormalities in growth and glucose metabolism b u t no evidence of cell injury. Experimental results showed that a defect in transcription was responsible for a growth hormone decrease. A detailed biochemical characterization o f a pituitary cell line (PO) t h a t expresses growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) was undertaken. The results obtained indicate: i ) by Northern-hybridization experiments and transcript prevalence assays that the steady s t a t e level of GH-mRNA in the infected c e l l s was three-to eight-fold lower than that in uninfected control c e l l s . In contrast, levels of PRL or actin mRNA did not d i f f e r significantly between v i r a l l y infected and uninfected c e l l s ; i i ) the nucleotransport and half l i f e of GH-mRNA were not affected in the infected c e l l s ; i i i ) by nuclear run-on experiments the r a t e of transcription of GH-mRNA was reduced about five-fold in the infected c e l l s , whereas PRL and actin mRNA displayed similar rates of transcription in infected and uninfected c e l l s ; 4) transfection of PO c e l l s with CAT under GH promotor control indicate that the virus effect i s a t the level of GH promotor. Hence, a virus can selectively affect the transcriptional machinery of a specific cellular gene, thereby severely effect host physiology, in the absence of cytopathology, and cause disease.

They share sequence homologies predominantly in their amino terminal domains, not only among themselves but also with two constitutively synthesized proteins, rat dynamin (a microtubule-activated GTPase) and Vpslp (a component of the yeast protein sorting pathway). Rat cells synthesize two cytoplasmic Mx proteins, termed Mx2 and Mx3, each 659 amino acids long. Mx2 and Mx3 differ in only eight amino acid positions, three of which located in their amino terminal halves and five in their carboxyl terminal thirds. They also differ in their electrophoretic mobility. When constitutively expressed from cDNA clones in mouse 3T3 cells, Mx2 gives a granular immunofluorescent staining and protects cells against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), while Mx3 gives diffuse staining and does not protect against VSV. In order to delineate the determinants of anti-VSV activity of Mx2, cDNAs were constructed that code for chimeric proteins composed of either 431 amino acids from the amino terminal domain of Mx2 linked to 228 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus of Mx3, or vice versa. These proteins were called Mx2/3 and Mx3/2, respectively. SDS-PAGE of in vitro translated SP6 mRNAs showed Mx3/2 comigrating with Mx3, and Mx2/3 with Mx2, indicating that electrophoretic mobility is determined by the amino terminal halves of the molecules. However, anti-VSV activity appears to reside in the carboxyl terminal 228 amino acids, since Mx3/2 gave granular staining and conferred resistance against VSV, while Mx2/3 gave diffuse staining and did not protect.M 325 THE GENERATION OF T Y P E A INFLUENZA (H3N2) V I R U S V A R I A N T S IN VIVO AND HOST C E L L SELECTION IN VITRO, Jacqueline M. Katz and Robert G. Webster, Department of Virology and Molecular Biology, St. Jude Children's Rcsearch Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38101. When influenza virus in an original clinical sample is cultivated in cmbryonated chicken eggs, multiple distinct variants are isolated which possess amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin (HA) molecule. In contrast, a homogeneous population of viruses i s isolated from the same clinical sample grown in mammalian cells. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique has enabled the direct sequence analyses of the HA gene of influenza viruses present in original clinical samples from infected individuals. It has been determined that over the region of the H3N2 influenza virus HA gene encoding antigenic and receptor-binding sites, the predominant virus replicating in an infected individual is identical to that of viruses after growth in several different mammalian cell types tested but differs by one or two amino acids from the viruses grown in eggs. Molecular clones of DNA amplified from original patient samples or infected animals are being sequenced in order to detect minor variants which may exist within the infected individual. Such analyses will provide insight into the mechanisms o f generation, selection and transmission o f variants which may arise during replication of influenza viruses in the respiratory tract o f the infected host.

A water soluble fragment of the influenza hemagglutinin can be released f r o m the v i r a l membrane by digestion w i t h the proteaseBromelain The s t r u c t u r e of 6HA i s known t o high resolution. I n addition BHA has been a very valuable tool f o r analyzing conformational changes and target bilayer interactions that occur during membrane fusion. Analogous ectodomain fragments of other v i r a l membrane fusion proteins would be s i m i l a r l y useful i n elucidating t h e i r fusion mechanisms. I n t h i s study we have tested a general method f o r generating such fragments by placing a cleavage s i t e f o r phosphatidyl-inositol phospholipase C (PI-PLC) at the point of membrane insertion. We have generated such a recombinant HA molecule that is anchored i n t o the l i p i d bilayer w i t h a PI t a i l . HA-Pi was expressed and transported t o the c e l l surface as assessed by both immunofluorescence and c e l l surface labelling Prelimary studies indicated that,like the w i l d type HA, PI-HA i s a t r i m e r . Moreover, HA-PI can be released f r o m the c e l l by digestion w i t h PI-PLC We are c u r r e n t l y assessing whether the released f o r m of HA-PI undergoes the same l o w pH-induced conformational change and bilayer interacttons that BHA does (steps essential f o r fusion). Furthermore, we are monitoring the fusogenic properties of HA-PI t o ask whether i t i s s u f f i c i e n t f o r HA t o be embedded i n only one l e a f l e t of the bilayer in order t o promote fusion. This strategy f o r creating a w a t e r soluble ectodomain should be applicable t o many other v i r a l membrane fusion proteins and should therefore aid i n elucidating both t h e i r biochemical properties and fusion requirements.

The sequence of the LMP-gene with its promoter and enhancer w a s determined. Comparison of the sequences for the B95-8, Raji and CAO isolates reveal differences unique to the CAO isolate in the promoter/enhancer as vell as in the amino acid sequences of the protein. Structural differences in the protein were located chiefly in the 20 aminoterminal residues and in the array of repeated amino acids in the carboxy-terminal part of the protein, where the CAO isolate displays a cluster of seven perfect repeats of 11 a.a. Three of these repeats have no counterpart in the other virus strains. This,taken together with tvo unique deletions of 5 and 10 a.a.in the carboxy terminal part adds up to a protein of 405 a.a. compared to 392 a.a. for B95-8 and Raji.

To further investigate the influence of poxvirus infection on arachidonic acid metabolism, B-SC-1 cells were infected with either CPV-BR or CPV-BR.Dl, and then stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187 in the presence of ['4C]-linoleic acid. arachidonate metabolites in infected cells by reverse-phase HPLC demonstrated a similar spectrum of cyclooxygenase and LO pathway products, except for the synthesis of a chemoattractant <15-L0 series DiHETE> by cells infected with the 38-kDa minus mutant virus.

In contrast, the human papillomaviruses (HPV) do not efficiently transform fibroblasts, and their E5 proteins do not resemble PDGF. However, introduction of the HPV16 E5 gene into established lines of cultured murine keratinocytes results in tumorigenic transformation, indicating that the HPV16 E5 gene is a transforming gene in cells similar to its natural host cell.

The HPV-16 E7 protein is a multifunctional protein with transcriptional modulatory and cellular transformation properties similar to the adenovirus El A proteins(CELL  53539, 1988). The N-terminal 37 amino acids of the E7 proteins encoded by the HPVs associated with genital tract lesions are highly conserved and are similar to the portions of Ad E1A conserved domains 1 and 2 involved in binding HPV-16 and HPV-18 have a higher binding affinity than the E7 proteins encoded by HPVB and HPV-11.

Enteroviruses can cause human myocarditis and can be molecularly detected in inflamed heart muscle. An enterovirus was isolated from both pre-mortem throat and post-mortem heart muscle of a 9-day old child with fulminant myocarditis. Anti-coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) neutralizing antibody neutralized both viruses, but sequence analysis of the 5' non-translated region suggests identity with modern coxsackievirus B2 isolates. The heart isolate induced inflammatory heart disease in the mouse, whereas the throat isolate did not. Isolation of the enterovirus from myocarditic human heart, propagation in cell culture, demonstration of murine cardiovirulency, and virus re-isolation from murine heart is the first rigorous test of Koch's postulates for any enterovirus as an etiologic agent of human myocarditis, and validates the CVB3-induced murine myocarditis model for the human disease. Pending sequence analysis, this may be the first report of a naturally occurring genetic recombinant coxsackievirus.

A correlation between high neutralizing activity arid smng seroreactivity against the peptides wggested that the corresponding regions might be involved in neutralization. Pcptidcq representing these regions were also able to inhibit neuimliwtion mediated by swum from HN-1 antibudy positive individuals. Neutralizing antibodies to the novcl rcgion of gp41 were found to be cross-reactive whereas hey were found to be. sUair-specific for the V3 region of gp120. The rcsults indicate that the conserved B-cell cpitope of the HIV-I gp41 (&a. 647-671) elicits a virus neutralizing antibody response during natural infection in humans and may thereforc bc considered for inclusion in a vaccine against MIV-1.",

            "text": "Per A. Brolidenl,2, K Broliden2, L Akerblom?, J Rosen4, E Norrby2 and B Wahrenl. The importance of the dependencc on single amino acids in the V3 region of Mv-1 gp120 was evaluated for virus neutralization and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Synthetic overlapping 15-mer peptides and a set doinission peptides covering a.a. 301-317 were uscd. Sera from 29 H W l infected individuals at different stages of disease were tested for neuualization, ADCC and specific IgG xactivity. Six HIV-1 neutralizing monoclonal antibodirs (Mabs) acted as controls. All MAbs reacted with aregon (a.a. 304-318) of gp120, previously shown to induce *wutralizing antibodies. The amino acids essential for reactivity were identified to be within the sequence GPGR (a.a. 312-315). The importance of this region lor occurrence of neutralizhg antibodies in infected humans was investigated using the same set of peptides. Out of 29 individuals, 21 were found to have neumlizing antibodizs in titers between 100-1ooO. Among the neuhlimtion-positive sera, 17/21 (81%) reac*:.d with a.a. 304-318, compared with only one of eight sera (13%) negative in neutralization. When any of the foul mino acids G, P, G or R were deleted, the sercmactivity of these neutralization-posiuve sera decreased considerably. The conserved sequence GPGR was therefore considered to be the most important fpr neuaalizarion in this region also in human sen One of the MAbs were able to mediate ADCC, indicating that the V3 region may be one important target for cytotoxicity. However, no correlation was found among the hitman sera ktween ADCC activity and IgG reactivity m a specific sequence within V3. Thus, the conserved sequence GPGR in the V3 region of gp120 is critical for virus ileutralization by human HlV-I specific antibodies. The two EBV-associated human malignancies Burkitt lymphoma (EL) and Nasopharingeal carcinoma (NPC) have a restricted expression of EBNA 2-6 and LMP in comparison with LCLs that express all EBV antigens. Expression of EBV antigens correlates with the expression of Bblast markers. In order to examine the heno pe dependent viral gene expression we have constructed a serie of somatic cell hybrids Arivedxy the fusion of EBV positive BLs and LCLs with non Bcell lines. Anal sis of EBV antigens in these hybrids showed that the expression of EBNA 2 to 6 is down regdated in the hybrids in parallel with the extinction of the B-cell specific markers CD 19, CD20, CD21, CD23 HLA class II antigens and lg, suggesting that the expression of EBNA 2 to 6 is dependent on the B-cell phenotype. EBNA-1 was the only EBV antigen regularly expressed in the hybrids indicating that EBNA-1 can be autonomously expressed. Our results rise question weather B-cell specific transacting factors play a role in the regulation of EBNA 2 to 6 and weather EBNA 1 can be transcribed independent from the big primary transcript that generates all EBNAs after alternative splicing.",

Individual genes were altered by either deletion or insertion mutagenesis. Single gene mutations were generated in the hemagglutinin (HA-), thymidine kinase (TK-), small subunit of the ribonucleotide reductase (sRR-), Bam HI site in Hind I11 F (BamF-), host range (HR-) and both of the growth factor (GF-) genes. Two large deletion mutants, one 2 0 Kb to the left and one 1 2 Kb to the right of the host range gene, were generated through condensation reactions between vaccinia promoters ectopically inserted at the 3' end of the host range gene. A TKdeletion mutant in the WR strain was also constructed. All of the mutants were characterized in a mouse model with regard to intracranial and intranasal LD-50, replication in the brain, dissemination after a respiratory infection, growth and pock formation in the skin, immunogenicity and transmission to naive cage mates. The results from these experiments have provided unique insight into vaccinia pathogenesis and attenuation. Intertypic chimaeric polioviruses previously constructed were shown to possess composite antigenicity and dual immunogenicityl. This prompted the investigation of Sabin type 1 as a presentation vector for neutralizing epitopes of other pathogens including HIV-1 and human papilloma virus HPV162.3. We have extended this work f o r the expression of defined epitopes of human CD4, the receptor for HIV. The ability of antisera to these chimaeras to block HIV infection and syncytia formation will be discussed. Those chimaeras containing CD4 residues which are believed to be involved in binding HIV are being assessed for their ability to bind gp120. The authentic RNA sequence of Sabin 3 used in vaccine in the United States has been determined. The sequence of the Sabin 3 vaccine strain, called LED 3: is unique. A novel base discovered in LED 3 is contained in one of the viral capsid protein coding regions and predicts a new Sabin 3-specific amino acid change as compared to published sequences (Stanway et al., 1983; Toyoda et al., 1984) . The reversion is observed to occur after replication of vaccine virus in the gut of primary vaccinees and after replication in nervous tissues of neurovirulence test monkeys. Passage conditions have been identified that lead to the reversion of the LED 3 specific base in the capsid region as well as the reversion of the attenuated base to the wild type base at 4 7 2 . The observation that these two base positions are found to revert to wild type bases during passage suggests that there is a selective advantage for virus containing the wild type bases at these positions. HHV-6 is a recently isolated herpesvirus which is highly prevalent in adult populations. The virus is tropic for CD4 positive lymphocytes and persists in the peripheral blood of a majority of seropositive individuals. We have recently determined the restriction endonuclease map of a Ugandan isolate of HHV-6 (U1102). The genome consists of a largely unique sequence of 141 kb flanked by direct repeat units of 10 kb. This structure differs from that determined for the other human herpesviruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Previous sequencing studies of HHV-6 U1102 have, however, demonstrated that both the arrangement of genes and the predicted amino acid sequence of their products closely resembles that of HCMV. We now present evidence, based on sequencing a further 34 kbp of selected regions of the genome, that the organization of coding and non-coding features of HHV-6 U1102 is collinear with that of the unique long component of HCMV. In particular, a single region of HHV-6 contains a local deficiency of CpG dinucleotides which identifies the major transactivating (immediate early, IE) genes in HCMV. The sequence of this region in HHV-6 contains a tandem array of repeats, each containing binding sites for cellular transcription factors NFkB and AP-2, which is likely to constitute the major IE enhancer. This region has been amplified using the polymerase chain reaction and the product shown to transactivate a range of heterologous promoters, including the HIV LTR. Evidence for the importance of this enzyme as a target in infected cells was demonstrated by glycan analysis of virion glycoproteins vhich showed the presence of high glucose glycopeptides.",

            "text": "6-0-butanoyl CAST (BUCAST) completely inhibited HIV qlycoprotain synthesis after acute infection and caused a major restriction in the cleavage of gp120 from gp160 in treated chronically infected cells. This a-glucosidase 1 inhibitor had potent effect on the growth of human cytomegalovirus which was also related to the reduced expression OP a virion associated glycoprotein. The critical dependence of both viruses on a-glucosidase 1 for the correct expression of glycoproteins suggests that this enzyme is a favourable antiviral target. HIV-LTR transactivation occurs following cell activation via PKC but not PKA-dependent pathways and by herpesvirus infection. We tested if CMV-IE could: 1) influence HIV-LTR transactivation by PKA-dependent stimuli, and 2) further amplify transactivation induced by PKC-dependent signals.HIV-LTR linked to a luciferase reporter gene was transiently transfected in a CD4+ T cell lymphoblastoid line (Jurkat clone) with or without CMV-IE 1-2 genes. CMV-IE alone transactivated the HIV-LTR(10-fold). Stimulation of PKA by Forskolin or a CAMP analog (8bromo-CAMP) did not transactivate HIV-LTR, but did so in the presence of CMV-IE (20-fold). Stimulation of PKC-dependent pathways by TNF and PMA increased HIV-LTR activity 20 and 100-fold, respectively in the presence of CMV-IE compared to 3 and 4 fold in its absence. Similar results were observed upon stimulation by cross-linked CD3 and CD28 antibodies. CMV-IE mediated amplification was independent of the NFkb binding motif within the HIV LTR. Furthermore, all the above stimuli were shown to transactivate the CMV promoter and to increase CMV-IE gene transcription.CMV-IE can mediate HIV-LTR transactivation by PKA-dependent stimuli and amplify PKC-dependent stimuli in T-lymphocytes. The oncogenic activity of Human Herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) DNA (GS strain) in NIH 3T3 cells has been reported previously (Razzaque, Oncogene 5, 1365, 1990). In the current study, we confirm and extend this observation to include another strain, HHV-6 GD, which was isolated by Dr. J. Luka from peripheral blood lymphocytes of a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome. Restriction enzyme analysis and monoclonal antibody (to GS strain) reaction did not show any difference between GS and GD strains of HHV-6. Like GS strain, the genomic DNA from GD strain could also morphologically transform NIH 3T3 cells. Two focus-derived cell lines established from this DNA transfection produced tumors in nude mice when injected subcutaneously. The transforming activity of this strain was identical to that of HHV-6 GS strain. With polymerase chain reaction using primers corresponding to the major capsid protein gene of HHV-6, viral DNA sequences were detected in both the focusderived and tumor-derived cell lines. Further analysis on the DNA sequences in these transformants and their role in transformation will be discussed. The effect of the EBV BNLF-1 gene product (latent membrane protein 1, W 1 ) on homotypic adhesion of a murine B-cell, A/J-95 was compared to that of 12,13-phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu). Three independent clones of A/J-95 cells, expressing high levels of the LMPl protein after retroviral transfer of the BNLFl gene under the HSV-1 TK-gene promoter, displayed a 5-7-fold increase in homotypic adhesion compared to controls. The addition of PDBu to the parental A/J-95 cells resulted in a similar increase in homotypic adhesion. The increased adhesion of the cells could in both cases be inhibited almost completely with a monoclonal antibody to the CDlla subunit of the adhesion molecule CDlla/CDl8 (Leu-CAMa, LFA-1) but not with a monoclonal antibody to CD54 (ICAM-1). The high level constitutive cell surface expression of CDlla, CD18 and CD54 was not significantly altered in cells expressing LMP-1, suggesting that the increased homotypic adhesion observed was caused by functional activation rather than by a quantitative increase in the adhesion molecules. The present experiments validate previous observations of LMPl-mediated aggregation of human B-cells in a murine system, demonstrate that LMP1, like phorbol esters, activate the CDlla/ CD18 dependent homotypic adhesion between B-cells to a comparable degree, and suggest that LMP1, like phorbol esters, participates in intracellular signalling pathways to accomplish this end.",
