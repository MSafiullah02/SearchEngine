If cDNA is required prior to PCR in Basic Protocol 4, this can take approximately 2 hr, depending on the number of samples and reagents used. The resulting cDNA can be left at 4\u00b0C at least overnight, so the reaction can be set up late in the day and left overnight with an infinite 4\u00b0C step as the last step. Similarly, preparing and running the PCR plate for Basic Protocol 4 can take anywhere from 1.5 to 3 hr, depending on the number of samples and the Taqman reagent used.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Time Considerations"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Differential cell line susceptibility to the emerging novel human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012: Implications for disease pathogenesis and clinical manifestation", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["F"], "last": "Chan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Chan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["K"], "last": "Choi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": ["K"], "last": "To", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Tse", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["P"], "last": "Cai", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Yeung", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "V", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Cheng", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Chen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "X", "middle": ["Y"], "last": "Che", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["K"], "last": "Lau", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Woo", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": ["Y"], "last": "Yuen", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2013, "venue": "J.
