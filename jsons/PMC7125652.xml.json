            "text": "Since the launch of Southwest Airlines in 1971, the concept of low-cost carriers (LCCs) has flourished across the globe. One of the most prominent consequences of the emergence of LCCs is the growth of the tourism industry (Chung and Whang, 2011; Olipra, 2012; Tsui, 2017). Numerous authors have explored the impact of LCCs on tourism in different countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Poland, Spain, New Zealand, and Italy (Alsumairi and Tsui, 2017; Olipra, 2012; Pulina and Cort\u00e9s-Jim\u00e9nez, 2010; Rey et al., 2011; Tsui, 2017; Vera Rebollo and Ivars Baidal, 2009). Regardless of the geography of the assessed markets, all these studies unanimously conclude that the introduction of the LCCs increases tourism demand. In other words, it can be said that LCCs induce their own new market. LCCs have also altered the business dynamics of the entire aviation industry by competing against the previously dominant full service carriers (FSCs) (Pels, 2008). Researchers have also explored the impact of LCCs on different aviation markets; however, the conclusions are conflicting and vary across regions. For example, some researchers reported that LCCs have failed to compete against the FSCs in Australia, as happened earlier in the USA, and UK (Forsyth, 2003; Graham and Vowles, 2006; UK Civil Aviation Authority, 2006). However, studies assessing South Korea, Europe, Western Europe, South Africa, and Taiwan show LCCs competing successfully against FSCs (Alderighi et al., 2012; Chung and Whang, 2011; Dobruszkes, 2006; Fourie and Lubbe, 2006; Lu, 2017). This indicates that LCCs may have different impact on the aviation markets in different geographies, as highlighted by authors such as Zhang et al. (2008). However, few attempts have been made to refine the approach for assessing the dynamics of LCC-FSC competition and address the element of conflict; this lacuna is addressed in this study.",

We build our study on the assumption that the competitive nature of LCC-FSC competition is not static; this leads to different conclusions, depending on the interval chosen for the analysis period. With this, we attempt to answer the following questions: 1) for the general aviation market, do LCCs induce their own new market without competing with the FSCs or do they, in fact, compete with FSCs in the same market? (2) can both these phenomena occur simultaneously because of non-static competition dynamics over time? (3) how does LCC-FSC competition fare in the presence of other means of fast transport, such as high-speed train? (4) how does the market growth (shrinking or expanding) affect the competition? To answer these questions, we apply the Lotka-Volterra (LV) model to the South Korean aviation market and address its enhanced scope by applying a moving-window LV model. The LV model is the first, and by far the most commonly used model to investigate competition dynamics. As the LV model cannot detect changes in competition dynamics over time, a moving-window technique is used to overcome this limitation.",

Second, South Korea has a typical leisure destination named Jeju Island, for which there is no other means of fast transport except air. Over 90% of travellers to Jeju Island use air transport (Chung and Whang, 2011). Third, on certain routes, the competitor is high-speed train, which allows an insight into the performance of LCCs in the presence of a competitor. Moreover, South Korean FSCs have deployed their own LCCs to compete with independent LCCs.",

            "text": "Aviation is divided in two categories: the first, conventional FSCs, represent premium services and, the second, LCCs represent low-budget travel. Despite many studies, it is still not confirmed whether LCCs compete with FSCs or the LCCs market is completely different from the FSCs market. Some researchers concluded that LCCs do not compete against FSCs, and if they do, they do so only partially (Forsyth, 2003; Gillen and Morrison, 2003; UK Civil Aviation Authority, 2006). In contrast, some authors are convinced that LCCs have succeeded in gaining a competitive advantage over FSCs (Chung and Whang, 2011; Franke, 2004; Fu et al., 2006). Franke (2004) reported that LCCs compete with FSCs, and can deliver 80% of the service quality at half the cost of conventional carriers. In addition, Skeels and General (2005) showed that LCCs compete with FSCs, and also create their own new market demand. However, these studies lacked an explanation of how and why these two phenomena occur simultaneously. This study proposes that the literature which does not find competitive behaviour between LCCs and FSCs basically refers to the early stages of LCC development when LCCs had a very niche product. This study addresses the fact that competition dynamics may change over time, and in the case of South Korea, these two phenomena occurred in two stages; initially, LCCs competed against FSCs and once LCCs established their own new market, the LCC-FSC competition reduced.",

This study addresses this limitation by integrating the moving-window technique with the LV model. This approach involves consecutively moving a data segment of a fixed length interval by one period through the entire data set to calculate the interaction parameters for each data segment, as illustrated in Fig. 6\n. We selected 4 years of data as the starting window and moved it by one month to calculate interaction parameters. Selection of window size is critical as too small a window may provide wider values for 95% confidence intervals (CI), which implies poor precision in the estimation of parameters. However, too wide a window may provide narrow CI but it reduces the number of observations for estimated parameters; this results in information loss. We performed experiments with 3- and 5-year windows as well, but finally selected the 4-year window based on narrow CI.",

Fig. 7 shows that the relationship is not mutualism for all periods, but rather shows a parasitic relationship (commensalism) for some time then a switch in roles halfway through; this supports our motivation of observing changing dynamics over time. Fig. 7(a) represents dependence of the growth of FSCs on LCCs demand; it shows that FSC did not gain any benefit from of LCCs initially, but began to do so later. The opposite is true for LCCs, where the dependency of LCCs growth on FSCs has decreased over time (Fig. 7[b]). We can summarise our results by saying that in the early years of the emergence of LCCs within the FSC-dominant market, a parasitic behaviour of LCCs on FSCs is observed. However, the role is reversed in the subsequent years and the competitive dynamics between FSCs and LCCs evolved to a parasitic behaviour of FSCs on LCCs. It is important to understand that dependency of the growth of LCCs on FSCs decreased over time but the growth of LCCs kept increasing (see Fig. 5), which indicates that LCCs created their own new market by attracting the new customers.",

This shows that the busiest leisure route in the world and the overall domestic market of South Korea exhibit a similar relationship between LCCs and FSCs. LCCs took away FSCs passengers only in the early years; however, the relationship reversed later and LCCs created their own new market.",

One can clearly notice how Asiana Air's decision to change business strategy in 2009 from FSCs to LCCs has benefitted Asiana Air in the domestic market. The change in the relationship between the two carriers is linked to the shift in strategy by Asiana-Air Busan, and also to its market dominance that emerged part way through this period. This illustrates predator-prey interaction in the airline industry.",

            "text": "This study utilized the moving-window LV model to investigate the impact of LCC's entry in the South Korean aviation market, which was earlier dominated by FSCs. The FSC-LCC competition analysis was divided into three different cases. The analysis of the overall domestic market was followed by a more in-depth analysis of Gimpo-Jeju route (expanding market) that connects the country's capital and a key national tourism hotspot (case 2). The analysis of first two cases revealed a similar mutual cooperative relationship (+, +) between LCCs and FSCs; in this situation both entities (LCCs and FSCs) benefit from each other's growth. In both of these cases the market is expanding. In this situation there is a competition between carrier types and that is the reason average fares decrease and volumes increase. So the mutual benefit is probably due to the fact that market is not saturated yet and still expanding. This situation changes over time, as was detected by the 4-year moving-window assessment to both datasets. The analysis results showed that relationship is not consistently mutual (+, +); rather, there is alternating commensalism (+, 0 to 0, +), which means FSCs growth did not depend on LCCs at first, while LCCs enjoyed a synergistic growth, along with that of FSCs. The earlier commensalism relationship (+, 0) of LCCs and FSCs is the reflection of the real-world case, where both Korean Air and Asiana Air failed to react to the sudden emergence of LCCs. Therefore, LCCs succeeded in abruptly gaining market share. In effect, LCCs generated a market of their own. Right after the economic crisis of 2008, there was an explosive growth in the aviation market. As a temporary approach to deal with the emergence of LCCs, Asiana Air and Korean Air deployed their own low-cost and premium-service flights. Meanwhile, both airlines adopted the strategy of airline-within-airline strategy as well. The effect of both the reactive measures can be observed in our LV model. The result is that FSCs now enjoy the benefit from growth of LCCs, whereas LCCs do not benefit from FSCs. Despite such a relationship, LCCs are growing consistently, which supports the argument of their own induced demand.",

Eventually, Asiana Air stopped its conventional services in 2009 and then switched to LCCs by introducing its own LCC. This led to Korean Air having a parasitic relationship with Asiana Air (0, +). The latter relationship shows that Korean Air became totally dependent on Air Busan's growth, which is also reflected in Fig. 4. It is also seen from Fig. 4 that Asiana Air struggled and always lagged behind Korean Air in terms of market gain until its transformation to Air Busan. After its transformation to an LCC, its market share increased, eventually surpassing that of Korean Air. Such a strategy change did not only benefit Air Busan itself but also stabilised the previously shrinking market owing to the presence of KTX, which further supports the argument of LCCs inducing their own market development in cases 1 and 2. It seems that an introduction of its own LCC by Korean Air, similar to Asiana Air, can excite the competition dynamics. Such step by Korean Air may help it to regain its previous market position and overall market may grow even further.",

The changing dynamics help us to understand that LCCs impact FSCs only in the early stages; later, after the creation of their own market, the impact on FSCs seems to reduce. Second, we explore how South Korean LCCs and FSCs have operated in the domestic aviation market over time. In the context of domestic tourism, we demonstrate that LCCs have flourished on leisure routes by creating their own new market. The findings show that competition dynamics change over time and provide a convincing explanation for the conflicting nature of findings about the LCC-FSC competitions discussed in past literatures.

Moreover, dynamics are sensitive to changes in market, especially to the changes in market size. Overall, the analysis shows that the emergence of LCCs in South Korea is a prime example of Southwest effect; LCCs increased supply by offering lower prices, incumbent airlines lowered their own fares, and sales rose for all airlines in the market.",

In a saturated or shrinking market, such as Busan (case 3), there is more likelihood of stiff competition. Whereas Korean Air stuck to its conventional premium services, the relatively struggling Asiana Air, which introduced its low-cost services in the form of Air Busan, surpassed the leading Korean Air, as depicted in Fig. 4.
