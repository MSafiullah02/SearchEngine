            "text": "COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019), a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2), has emerged as a rapidly spreading communicable disease affecting more than 100 countries across the globe at present. The disease is primarily spread through large respiratory droplets, though the possibility of other routes of transmission cannot be ruled out, as the virus has been found in stool and urine of affected individuals [1]. The disease severity has varied from mild self-limiting flu-like illness to fulminant pneumonia, respiratory failure and death. There are regional variations in the mortality rates and these estimates are rapidly changing as more data are becoming available. There were 95,333 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide with a mortality rate of 3.4% according to the situation report of World Health Organisation on March 5, 2020 [2]. However, a much lower mortality of 1.4% has been reported in analysis of data of 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 552 hospitals in mainland China [3]. Considering that the number of unreported and unconfirmed cases is likely to be much higher than the reported cases, the actual mortality may be less than 1%, which is similar to that of severe seasonal influenza [4]. India has 39confirmed cases till 10th March, 2020 and contact surveillance of these cases is going on. The understanding of epidemiological characteristics of this infection is evolving on a daily basis as the disease is spreading to different parts of the globe.",

More frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels (with use of self-monitoring blood glucose) is required. Good glycemic control may lessen chances of superadded bacterial pneumonia as well.b.Patients with diabetes and co-existing heart disease or kidney disease need special care and attempts should be made to stabilise their cardiac/renal status.c.Attention to nutrition and adequate protein intake is important. Any deficiencies of minerals and vitamins need to be taken care of.d.Exercise has been shown to improve immunity, though it might be prudent to be careful and avoid crowded places like gymnasia or swimming pools.e.It is important to take influenza and pneumonia vaccinations. The latter may decrease chances of secondary bacterial pneumonia after respiratory viral infection, however, data in present viral epidemic is not available.\nB.General Preventive Measuresa.Thorough handwashing with soap and water should be encouraged since it kills the virus. Use of alcohol-based hand rubs is also useful.b.There is a need to practise proper respiratory hygiene with covering of mouth and nose with bent elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing. Touching of mouth, nose and eyes should be avoided.c.Contact with an affected person needs to be minimised. Use of recommended face masks is advised if there is a contact with someone with respiratory symptoms.d.Non-essential travel to major affected areas should be avoided in order to restrict the spread of infection.\n\n",

Hydration should be maintained and symptomatic treatment with acetaminophen, steam inhalation etc. can be given.d.Patients with type 1 diabetes should measure blood glucose and urinary ketones frequently if fever with hyperglycemia occurs. Frequent changes in dosage and correctional bolus may be required to maintain normoglycemia.e.Anti-hyperglycemic agents that can cause volume depletion or hypoglycemia should be avoided. Dosage of oral anti-diabetic drugs may need to be reduced. Patients should follow sick day guidelines and may need more frequent monitoring of blood glucose and drug adjustment.f.Hospitalised patients with severe disease need frequent blood glucose monitoring. Oral agents especially metformin and sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors need to be stopped.g.Insulin is the preferred agent for control of hyperglycemia in hospitalised sick patients.\n",
