Since the SARS epidemic, numerous articles have been published describing the clinical features and management of SARS. Suggested treatments, including ribavirin and methylprednisolone therapy, according to immediate patient response have also been documented.5 Unfortunately, lack of clinical proof has prevented confirmation of these therapies, and in vitro experiments to determine inhibitory concentrations of ribavirin do not support the achievement dose due to the limitations imposed by cellular toxicity in the human body.6 Although this life-threatening disease appears to be under control following major worldwide efforts and implementation of quarantine policy, the return of SARS is possible. Although drugs with anti-coronavirus (CoV) activities have been identified,7\u201311 as yet no anti-CoV drug has been approved and a vaccine has yet to be made available. Previous reports on other viral infections have suggested that convalescent plasma or serum is effective where no other treatment is available or in an emergency.12,13",

Following informed consent, convalescent plasma was obtained from a married couple and another patient: one was the index case of the TMHH outbreak, and the others had recovered at day 47 and 3 months, respectively, after SARS-CoV infection. Donors were blood type O and seronegative for hepatitis B and C, HIV, syphilis and human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I and II (HTLV-I and -II). Serum antibody (IgG) titre was >640. Apharesis was performed with a CS 3000 plus cell separator (Baxter, Deerfield, IL, USA) followed by the formation of the convalescent phase plasma.

The efficiency of the labelling procedure was assessed by measuring the molar ratio of dye to protein and analysing it with a scanner (Genepix 4000B; Axon, CA, USA).

This 28-year-old male experienced fever to 38\u00b0C, but as there were no other signs of infection such as pneumonia, diarrhoea or leucopenia, he was initially self-quarantined in a separate dormitory. The fever subsided after 2 days, but rose to 37.8\u00b0C on 10 May 2003 and he was immediately admitted to an isolation ward. Cough, malaise, rhinorrhoea, sore throat and headache subsequently occurred and he was deemed to be a probable SARS case. During the quarantine in his dormitory, two nurses, who had been in direct care of SARS patients, were admitted to the isolation ward on 8 and 10 May 2003. They had signs of fever, myalgia and/or headache. An investigation into outbreaks among HCW was initiated and a total of 89 HCW were quarantined. Subsequently, fever was observed in another three nurses and a resident physician during the period 11\u201315 May (Table 1). Apart from HCW 6, a resident who requested further self-quarantine, three nurses were admitted immediately after experiencing fever. Most of these HCW had worked frequently on one of the negative pressure wards. One of the two negative pressure wards was then immediately closed on 16 May. All patients in the closed ward were then transferred to the remaining negative pressure ward and no more cases of fever were observed in the HCW thereafter. The last patient in the isolation ward (HCW 7) was discharged on 14 June. The specific isolation wards for SARS were closed down on the day the last patient was discharged. No SARS case was noted subsequently until 16 December 2003. A SARS-CoV researcher experienced fever on 10 December and was self-quarantined. As the fever had not subsided after 5 days, he was finally admitted as a probable SARS case. RT\u2013PCR of the sputum was immediately performed on admission and the researcher was confirmed positive for CoV infection. Serum from all the above infected HCW was collected after 3\u20135 weeks.

None of the HCW presented with diarrhoea or dyspnoea on admission; however, three of them developed these maladies after 4\u201315 days. At fever onset, four HCW had abnormal chest radiographs, with two increased lung markings and two patch infiltrations. Empirical treatment with oral ribavirin (1200 mg/day) and moxifloxacin (400 mg/day) were commenced on the day of admission for all HCW, but not the researcher. Methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) and intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) (1 mg/kg/day for 2 days) were given to HCW 4 and 7 after persistence of chest radiographic progression. Because of progression of pulmonary infiltration and oxygen desaturation, convalescent plasma was then transfused at a rate of 2 mL/min on days 11 and 10 after admission, respectively. In the laboratory-acquired case (HCW 8), protease inhibitor (lopinavir 400 mg/ritonavir 100 mg/12 h) with convalescent plasma was started after confirmation of SARS-CoV infection. Serial chest X-rays revealed progression of pulmonary infiltration in five HCW, becoming most severe at day 9 of the fever onset. All but one HCW experienced at least two fever peaks. Three fever peaks were observed in two HCW who failed to respond to the empirical treatment and developed severe progression.",
