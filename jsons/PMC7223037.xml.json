Ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAPs) have been best studied and protocols have been developed which have lowered their risk. In contrast, the prevalence of non-ventilator-associated pneumonias (NVAPs) has remained essentially unchanged.1 Classic hospital-acquired pneumonias are defined as those that develop after 48 hours of hospital admission.6 While the definition for NVAPs can also be applied to nursing home patients, there are marked differences between the two populations, including length of stay (13.7 months for nursing homes7 vs 6.1 days for acute care hospitals),8 demographics and co-morbidities. Nonetheless, given the potential importance of the oral cavity as a bacterial source for NVAP, we generally included both populations in the analysis, but analysed them separately.",

However, given the bacterial spectrum reported for NVAP, it is impossible to ignore the nose, nasopharynx or sinuses as also being important.

The individual elements comprising these regimens have not been consistent and range dramatically in their intensity. However, trends in outcomes potentially support their utility. If professionally delivered oral care regimens are to be considered for universal standard of care for NVAP prevention, several critical questions require answers:Is the nursing time, effort and instrumentation needed for an expanded oral hygiene programme justified by a cost/benefit analysis; that is, how effective are expanded oral hygiene programmes in modifying risk of NVAP?Are there specific risk factors which can prospectively identify patients at risk of NVAP and how do these patients specifically respond to oral hygiene programmes?When is the optimum time to initiate OCIs; that is, are programmes which commence at the time of admission effective, or should oral hygiene programmes begin earlier, and if so, how much earlier?Are the pathogens observed in NVAP found in the oral biofilm, where are the primary depots of pathogens and which OCIs best target those depots?",

Due to the expected clinical heterogeneity between studies, we decided a priori to use a DerSimonian and Laird (DL) random effects model for all analyses.14 Testing for heterogeneity between the studies was performed using Cochran's Q test15 and the I2 test.13 A p value <0.05 or an I2 higher than 50% were considered significant evidence for heterogeneity. Additionally, we used the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman (HKSJ) method16 to retrieve more adequate error rates. Simulations have shown that the HKSJ method performs better than DL, especially when there is heterogeneity and the number of studies in the meta-analysis is small.16,17,18,19,20 Subgroup analysis was performed to assess whether there were differences between professional dental care and usual care, use of antimicrobial chlorhexidine (CHX) and usual care, and mortality due to pneumonia in enhanced OCI versus usual care.

It is noteworthy that enhanced oral hygiene negatively impacted risk in one United States study (RR of NVAP was 1.36).27 Aside from the patient population and location of each trial, the intensity of the oral hygiene intervention was not uniform and varied principally in two ways: who performed the oral hygiene intervention and whether an antimicrobial rinse was included in the oral hygiene regimen.",

This effect is comparable to previous meta-analysis.34 While this data supports the concept that effective oral microbial debridement favourably impacts NVAP risk, the conclusion that formal dental training results in demonstrably superior outcomes could be misleading as the effect might not be specifically attributed to variances in technical competencies, but rather to focus and time spent on the oral hygiene process. Whereas non-dental professionals typically number oral care as one of many patient-related daily tasks, the sole emphasis of the dental professionals was on mouth hygiene. The observation that oral care delivered by a dedicated nursing assistant produced equivalent NVAP risk supports this argument.7 Competing time demands for services may limit nurses' capacity to deliver optimal mouthcare.28 Additional studies are necessary to more fully investigate the impact of provider qualifications on NVAP risk modification, since the cost implications of dedicated oral health aides, regardless of their qualification, is not trivial.",

Despite the designated oral care regimen, no impact on NVAP rates were seen between the control (1.7%) and test groups (1.8%). Critically, despite study-specific training and daily monitoring, nursing compliance was only 1.6 times per day, only slightly better than patient self-brushing frequency (1.2 times per day). However, when subjects from both arms were pooled and compared based on whether they developed NVAP, the odds ratio for NVAP decreased by 40% when tooth brushing increased by once per day, regardless of who performed the procedure.

However, whether there is equivalent contribution to hospital-associated pneumonia among the different microbiological eco-environments in the mouth (that is, tooth-borne bacteria vs mucosal bacterial niches like the dorsal tongue) is unclear.39,40 Likewise, the comparative effectiveness of different oral hygiene interventions on impacting bacterial pathogens is unresolved.41 Our analysis confirms the need for additional study to fully assess the benefit of OCI, optimise its timing and personalise the intensity of OCI-based individualising risk/benefit.

            "text": "In the introduction, we noted four questions to which answers would better define NVAP risk and intervention strategies. Given NVAP's potential clinical and economic burden, there is surprisingly little definitive documentation in the form of RCTs which speak to the efficacy of directed intervention methods. Most of the RCTs reported were done in nursing homes - most in Japan - and they conclude that structured enhanced oral hygiene regimens effectively reduced the rate of NVAP, and that enhanced oral hygiene delivered by dental professionals were most effective. Therefore, the generalisability of the results is limited. As a proof-of-concept, the results of such studies can be concluded to be positive with an overall reduction in VAP rates of greater than 10%, but their broad translatability to the general hospital population is unclear. While good oral hygiene for hospitalised patients should be as consistent as handwashing and bathing, the current body of clinical research defining extended oral interventions as they relate to VAP risk, and the comparative effectiveness of various oral care interventions, is incomplete. Given the impact of NVAP, large, structured, randomised trials in which specific interventions are tested are critical.",
