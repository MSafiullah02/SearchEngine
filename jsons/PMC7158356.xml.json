This area is a frequent site of moist dermatitis, especially in obese rabbits kept in humid, warm environments that may have difficulty grooming themselves.\u2022The sense organs of rabbits are well developed. Like other prey species, the eyes are laterally set. This provides a completely circular field of vision with the exception of the small area below the mouth. Thus, long sensory hairs around the snout and the sensitivity of the lips help rabbits discriminate food.\u2022Teeth are open rooted and grow continuously. The deciduous teeth are shed right around the time of birth and the permanent teeth complete eruption around 3 to 5 weeks of age. The dental formula is 2/1 incisors, 0/0 canines, 3/2 premolars, and 2-3/3 molars. Rabbits are distinguished from rodents by possessing an extra set of upper incisors, which are also known as \u201cpeg teeth.\u201d\u2022The gastrointestinal (GI) tract has a simple glandular stomach, a long intestinal tract, and a large cecum.\u2022The stomach serves as a reservoir for ingesta and is rarely empty. It holds approximately 15% of the GI contents. The cardia and pylorus are well developed, and, due to the anatomic arrangement of the cardia to the stomach, rabbits are unable to vomit.\u2022The cecum is the largest organ in the abdominal cavity and holds approximately 40% of the GI contents.\u2022Rabbits exhibit cecotrophy, which means they consume soft cecotrophs, also known as \u201cnight feces.\u201d Antiperistaltic contractions in the colon retrograde non-fiber particles and fluid back into the cecum for fermentation and the formation of cecotrophs, which are an important source of B-vitamins, electrolytes, and nitrogen.\u2022The skeletal system is light and delicate compared with most mammals. The skeleton makes up 8% of the total body weight in rabbits, as opposed to 13% of the total body weight in cats.\n",

As a general rule, females (does) sexually mature at approximately 4 to 8 months of age and males (bucks) sexually mature around 6 to 10 months of age.\u2022Females have a silent estrus and are induced ovulators.\u2022Breeding seasons are influenced by day length and temperature, though mating can occur year-round when environmental conditions are controlled. Gestation lasts for an average of 30 to 33 days. Pseudocyesis may last 17 days.\u2022Depending on the breed, litters range from 4 to 10 kits. Primaparous does usually have smaller litters. Kits are born blind and hairless and remain in the nest for approximately 3 weeks.\u2022Does have four and five pairs of mammary glands and nipples spread from the axilla down to the inguinal region. Does usually nurse only once daily for 3 to 5 minutes.\u2022Neonatal rabbits are totally dependent on milk up to day 10. Rabbit milk varies with stage of lactation but is approximately 13% protein, 9% fat, and 1% lactose. Small amounts of solid feed and hay can be digested around day 15 and cecotrophy commences on day 20.\n",

Cages should be at least tall enough to allow the rabbit to stand on its hind limbs and be easy to clean.\u2022Cages with plastic bottoms and wire tops are easy to clean and are well ventilated. Wire mesh flooring may also be used; however, provide a solid area for the rabbit as wire flooring may predispose rabbits to sore hocks. Use 14-gauge wire with the mesh openings no greater than 1 \u00d7 2.5 cm to prevent the rabbit from getting its feet caught.\u2022Straw or hay bedding should be provided in one area of the cage. Soiled bedding should be cleaned out daily. Because most rabbits are fastidious and prefer to defecate and urinate in one spot, they often can be trained to use a litterbox.\u2022Rabbits can be housed indoors or outdoors at temperatures ranging from 40\u00b0F to 80\u00b0F. Rabbits are very susceptible to heat stroke in ambient temperatures above 85\u00b0F. If outdoor housing is used, provide ventilation or protection from direct sunlight. In temperatures below 40\u00b0F, provide heat or protection from cold.\u2022Rabbits should be allowed time out of the cage regularly for exercise and socialization.

Most commercial pellets are nutrient dense (high in protein and digestible carbohydrates) and can predispose rabbits to obesity. High-fiber, timothy-based pellets (Oxbow Pet Products, Murdock, NE; www.oxbowhay.com) are preferable over alfalfa-based pellets.\u2022The high level of calcium in alfalfa diets may result in hypercalciuria or urinary calculi.\u2022Rabbits like sweet foods. A limited amount (approximately 2 tablespoons per 2 pounds of body weight) of fruits such as papaya, melon, or berries can be provided as a treat or to entice an anorectic animal to eat.\u2022Foods high in starches or fat such as seeds, nuts, bread, and corn are not advisable as they can predispose rabbits to obesity and GI disease.\u2022Fresh water should always be available.

Make sure the nostrils are not occluded and the neck is extended or the rabbit will have difficulty breathing. Alternatively, a metal speculum made for rabbit dentistry can be used to hold the mouth open; however, this tool can damage the oral mucosa if used inappropriately.3.Use a short vaginal or nasal speculum with an attached light source to examine the oral cavity. Check both lateral and medial edges of upper and lower molars.4.A dental drill rounds and smoothes sharp edges but must be used with care. Use a tongue depressor or the speculum to isolate the arcade and prevent damage to the tongue or buccal mucosa. Burr guards can also be purchased. Long-shank burrs made specifically for use in the long, narrow oral cavity of rabbits are available.5.A small bone rongeur can be used to clip the sharp edges of the cheek teeth. Use a tongue depressor or speculum to push the tongue to one side while clipping the medial edges of the lower cheek teeth. This method is quick and easy but leaves rough edges and may cause fractures of the teeth.\u2022Root elongation of the premolars and molars can develop in rabbits with chronic malocclusion. Elongated roots of the mandibular teeth can be palpated as firm bony nodules on the ventral mandible. Roots of the maxillary teeth can invade the nasal passages, sometimes causing obstruction and resulting in inspiratory stridor. The roots often become infected, resulting in mandibular, maxillary, or retrobulbar abscesses (see \u201cMandibular and Joint Abscesses\u201d).\n",

Maintain the limb in a normal position and incorporate both the joints above and below the fracture into the splint. Ideally, there should be at least 50% cortical contact between the fragment ends.\u2022\nIntramedullary pins can be used for better axial alignment of long bone fractures and to minimize bending and rotational forces. The pins should occupy at least 60% to 70% of the medullary cavity. Cross-pins can be used for supracondylar humeral or femoral fractures. Bone plates are not usually recommended other than in large rabbits because the thin cortices of rabbit bones makes screw placement difficult.\u2022\nExternal skeletal fixation provides rigid stability with minimal soft tissue disruption. Because fixator pin diameter should not exceed 20% of the bone diameter, Kirschner wires are often used in smaller patients. Most metal bars and clamps are too large or heavy for rabbits; therefore, bone cement or acrylics injected into appropriately sized rubber tubing are effective as fixator bars. (see Chapter 111 for examples of external skeletal fixators)\u2022Severely comminuted or open fractures may be best managed with limb amputation. Rabbits usually adapt well to amputation and can ambulate easily on three limbs. Forelimb amputation is best performed by removing the scapula. Mid-femoral amputation of the hind limb is preferred over coxofemoral disarticulation.\u2022With a joint luxation, anesthesia is needed to manipulate the joint into normal position. With the joint reduced and the limb in extension, apply a splint to allow the surrounding soft tissue to develop fibrosis and keep the luxation reduced. Some luxations may additionally require a transarticular pin to stabilize the joint.See Section 8 for treatment of orthopedic disorders in dogs and cats.\n",
