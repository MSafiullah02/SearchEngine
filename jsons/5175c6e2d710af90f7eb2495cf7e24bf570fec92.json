            "text": "Post-colonial Nigeria has been plagued with various types of violent conflicts. A bloody civil war in which an estimated 1 million people were killed ravaged the country from 1967 to 1970. Accounts of the war, both real and in fictional forms, have been provided by several writers, including Amadi (1973) , Achuzia (1986) , Shillington (2005) , St Jorre (1972) , Madiebo (1980) , Forsyth (1969) , Kirk-Greene (1971) , Iroh (1979) , Ademoyega (1981) , Adichie (2007) , and Johnson (2017) . Interethnic and intra-communal conflicts have also shaken the foundations of the nation since 1960 when colonial rule ended. 1 Other violent conflicts that have plagued the country are religious conflicts in Kano, Bauchi, Kaduna, Kafanchan, Zaria, Jos, Maiduguri, and many other places. Blood-letting in the name of religion in these and other places in Nigeria has left thousands dead and wounded. Destruction of property in the course of religious violence in Nigeria has also wreaked economic calamity on the country. For instance, wanton destruction of property during the Maitatsene religious uprising in Kano from 1980 to 1985 resulted in the loss of lives and of by the government that the group is a spent force. Its success in the attack also shows that the jihadist group has continued to acquire enough resources to attack what it may consider as targets of high value in the country.",

The terrorist group opposes democracy and rejects Christianity in Nigeria, and it seeks to convert Christians and other non-Muslims to Islam. Other things that have incurred the ire of the group have included the consumption of alcohol and participation in civic activities such as voting and running for elective posts. The terrorist group, operating in the name of Islam, rejects any ideology and teachings of the faith that differs from its own. It sees itself as part of a global movement for the restoration of the glories of Islam.",

That successful operation, and its bombing of the United Nations' offices in Abuja in August 2011, as well as its pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State(IS) in March 2016, further beamed an international searchlight on its military capabilities and prowess.

It provides a critical analysis of Boko Haram's media strategy and shows that its social media messaging is part of its overall military and ideological strategies. The authors examine Boko Haram's attempts to wage a battle for the hearts and minds of Nigerians through a deliberate use of social media to disseminate its messages. Focusing on statements and video appearances by its leader, Abubakar Shekau, Boko Haram's overt and subtle messages to Nigerians and the world at large are outlined. Using content-analytic methodology, the chapter examines the thrust of the messages to decipher their major themes, intents and target audiences. The authors contend that Boko Haram's messages reveal what the group thinks of itself, the Nigerian government and the Nigerian security establishment. We contend that Boko Haram deliberately uses crude and unsophisticated messaging techniques to convey its brutality, military invisibility and total disdain for the Nigerian government and its armed forces. We contend that Boko Haram uses its social media messaging to assert the righteousness of its interpretation of Islam, arguing that Boko Haram uses Islamic religious imageries and rhetoric to justify its atrocities. We have analyzed Boko Haram's media strategy within the theoretical framework of propaganda and conclude that unlike IS, Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations that use social media messaging as a recruitment tool, Boko Haram uses its messaging to instill fear and to convince its viewers of its inevitable victory over the Nigerian government. Our analysis reveals that not only does Boko Haram use its messaging to claim that the Nigerian government is anti-Islamic but also that it utilizes it to define good or proper Muslims.",

            "text": "As noted earlier, Boko Haram's reign of violence has been the biggest national security threat that Nigeria has faced since 1999 when the country returned to civil rule. It has also been the biggest blood-letting since the end of the Civil War in 1970. From August 2014 until February 2015 when combined military operations by Nigeria and its neighbors-Cameroon, Chad, and Niger-reversed Boko Haram's territorial gains, the Jihadist group controlled a good portion of Nigeria. During that period, it controlled fourteen local governments areas, several major towns and many villages-swathes of Nigerian territories that amounted to over 70,000 square miles, about the size of Belgium, and six times more land than IS in Iraq and Syria controlled at about the same time. All of the territories amounted to about 20 % of Nigeria, according to a New York Times report. 5 According to a November 15, 2015 report in the New York Times, Boko Haram was responsible for 6664 deaths in 2014, overtaking IS, which killed 6073 in the same year as the world's most number one terrorist organization. Like IS in Iraq and Syria, it decapitates some of its enemies by slitting their throats. In fact, it openly pledged allegiance to IS in March 2015. Like IS, it intends to create an Islamic caliphate. Unlike IS, however, what Boko Haram opposes is more certain than what it intends to do with power.",

According to the report, Kashim Shettima, the governor of Borno State, noted that 2.1 million people had been displaced, and property worth $9 billion destroyed by Boko Haram as at December 2016. In addition, Shettima said that 956,453 private houses, representing 30 % of the number of houses in Borno State, were destroyed across the twenty-seven local government areas of the state. In a single attack on the city of Baga in January 2015, for example, Boko Haram killed over 2000 people. 6 Churches, banks, schools, markets, car parks, farms, government offices, police stations and military barracks have been the principal targets of Boko Haram's attacks. Suicide bombings, motorcycle ride-by shootings, detonation of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and invasions by a large contingent of its fighters are the main instruments of the terrorists' destructive strategies. In addition to creating millions of internally displaced persons (IDPs), Boko Haram has forced over 300,000 Nigerians to seek refuge in neighboring countries. An editorial in The Guardian (Nigerian) newspaper of November 13, 2014 stated that \"there were in Cameroun alone, 33,000 Nigerians that fled Gwoza, a town in Borno State\u2026.\" Although Boko Haram began its terrorist activities in Nigeria, it has become a regional menace in West Africa as it has spread its attacks to Niger, Cameroon, and Chad.",

            "text": "Boko Haram's terrorist activities, in addition to causing thousands of deaths in Nigeria, have virtually brought all economic activities in the northeastern zone of the country to a halt. Apart from the humanitarian crisis created by the jihadist organization, the economic costs of the violence have been enormous. By September 2015, Boko Haram had destroyed infrastructure that would cost more than $1 billion to rebuild in Borno State alone (Ibukun and Olukayode, 2015) . Shehu (2015) has argued that violent attacks by Boko Haram paralyzed businesses, banking, tourism, transportation and investments in the affected region. The group has seriously disrupted agricultural production, the mainstay of the economy in the area. Drastic reduction in agricultural production has created a specter of famine for millions of people in the violence-ravaged areas. In 2014, the Nigerian government budgeted 12 billion Naira to feed people in internally displaced persons' camps. The government earmarked 47 billion Naira in the 2017 budget for that purpose. According to the Presidential Committee on North-East Initiatives (PCNI), this was grossly inadequate as the figure to feed the IDPs at the displaced camps should have been 108 billion Naira. Quoting a United Nations estimate, The Economist magazine in its September 1, 2016 issue reported that \"240,000 children in Borno are suffering from severe acute malnutrition-the deadliest category of it. More than 130 persons will die each day without assistance. Across the wider north-east part of Nigeria, a population equivalent to New Zealand's, is in need of food aid.\" Searcey and Santora (November 18, 2015) , noted how Boko Haram's violence has caused food shortages in Cameroon. According to their report in the New York Times: \"Farmers have fled, leaving behind fallow fields. Herdsmen have rerouted cattle drives to avoid the violence. Throughout the region, entire villages have emptied, leaving a string of ghost towns with few people for Boko Haram to dominate-and little for the group to plunder.\" 7 Boko Haram's attacks on Baga and other fishing communities in the Lake Chad area have drastically reduced the quantity of fish harvested in the area. Attacks by Boko Haram have also curtailed tourism in the north-western part of Cameroon as well as various parts of north-eastern Nigeria. In addition, the Nigerian government has expended billions of dollars in extra defense in response to Boko Haram.",

We contend that a comprehensive understanding of what Boko Haram stands for and the implications of its attacks can be understood by adding succinct analyses of its media strategy to what is already known about its military strategy. Boko Haram uses its media strategy to advance its military goals as it frequently utilizes video appearances by its leader, Abubakar Shekau, to threaten military attacks. We also seek to demonstrate, using Boko Haram for illustrative purposes, that social media make it relatively easy for extremist groups such as Al Shabaab, IS, Al Qaeda, and other jihadist groups to articulate and disseminate their messages to a worldwide audience, a global reach that would not have been possible without the commitment of enormous and resources. A group such as Boko Haram may be particularly successful in articulating its messages when it is not confronted with counter-narratives by governments and other entities, or when the counter-narratives appear less persuasive than the propaganda that the group is churning out.",

IS has been very deft in using Twitter and its English language magazine, Dabiq, for its propaganda. According to Koerner (2016) , Tashfeen Malik who, with her husband Syed Farook, shot and killed fourteen people in San Bernardino, California, in December 2015, used Facebook to pledge allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi a few minutes after the killings began. Berger (2015) acknowledged the indispensability of social media to terrorism. As he noted, \"jihadists have figured out how to use social media to make an impact, even though their numbers are minuscule in comparison to the overall user base \u2026 its highly organized social media campaign uses deceptive tactics and shows a sophisticated understanding of how such networks operate\" (p. 1). Blaker (2015) , examining IS' use of social media, asserted that: ISIS has made great use of the Internet and online social media sites to spread its message and encourage others, particularly young people, to support the organization, to travel to the Middle East to engage in combat-fighting sideby-side with other jihadists, or to join the group by playing a supporting rolewhich is often the role carved out for young women who are persuaded to join ISIS. (p. 1) This chapter is also significant because by analyzing the speeches made by Boko Haram's leader in the social media and in particular YouTube videos and major acts of terrorism carried out by the group, Nigerian and West African leaders and leaders elsewhere in the world might further understand how the minds of the leaders of terrorist organizations work. The more they are understood, the more the world will be able to know what motivates them to commit such heinous, atrocious and acrimonious crimes.",

After his expulsion from two mosques for preaching a radical brand of Islam, he set up his own mosque and was able to attract a large following among the city's young men. The group became better known in 2009 when it clashed with the police, attacking police stations and other public institutions in Maiduguri. When the police could not contain the group, the federal government deployed the armed forces. The military fought pitched battles with Boko Haram fighters, and its mosque and headquarters were destroyed. Yusuf was apprehended by the military and handed over to the police; he was subsequently shot to death while being held in police custody. According to Mu'azu (2011) , the police stated that he died during gunfire exchanges with their officers. Yusuf 's father-in-law and about eight hundred members of Boko Haram were killed during the fighting in 2009. Some of the group's survivors fled to the neighboring countries of Chad and Niger. Boko Haram was able to recover from its losses, and, as subsequent events clearly demonstrated, it became even more deadly. It is now led by another young cleric, Abubakar Shekau. However, one Abu Musab al-Barnawi claims that he leads another faction of the group.",

We will never accept any system of government apart from the one stipulated by Islam because that is the only way that Muslims can be liberated. We do not believe in any system of government, be it traditional or orthodox except the Islamic system and that is why we will keep on fighting against democracy, capitalism, socialism and whatever. We will not allow the Nigerian Constitution to replace the laws that have been enshrined in the Holy Qur'an, we will not allow adulterated conventional education to replace Islamic teachings. We will not respect the Nigerian government because it is illegal. We will continue to fight its military and the police because they are not protecting Islam. We do not believe in the Nigerian judicial system and we will fight anyone who assists the government in perpetrating illegalities. 8 The sophistication of Boko Haram's bombing operations and its simultaneous and co-ordinated attacks on multiple targets indicate its ability to tap into external resources in the form of weapons, training, logistics and financing. Evidence of the group's military capability is the use of rocket-propelled grenades and anti-aircraft guns in its May 2013 attacks on Bama and its September 12, 2014 downing of a Nigeria Air Force jet plane. 9 While its immediate grievances are directed against the federal government of Nigeria, Boko Haram operates under a global brand of Islamic fundamentalism. It is thus a grievous error to view the group solely through the prism of the internal dynamics of Nigerian politics. Its ability to attract fighters from Niger and Chad as well as its pledge of allegiance to IS in March 2015 and the acknowledgement that some of its fighters are trained in Somalia and Mali are clear pointers to its global dimensions. Even though some of its complaints are wrapped around Nigeria-specific issues, Boko Haram is motivated by a global Islamic radicalism. As was the case with Al-Shabab in Somalia and Al Dine in Mali, Boko Haram has struck with a deadly force in Nigeria because the country's poor governance made it a target of opportunity. The group merely capitalized on the weakness of the Nigerian state, and exploited existing ethnoreligious tensions to launch its insurgency against the country. The external dimensions of Boko Haram are also signposted by the similarities between its tactics and those adopted by Islamic insurgents in Iraq, Afghanistan and North Africa. This is not a mere coincidence. Boko Haram's suicide-bombing, co-ordinated simultaneous attacks on multiple targets, the use of IEDs and the utilization of motorcycle ride-by assassinations are precisely the methods that have recently been used by Islamic terrorists in other parts of the world.",

It is therefore fallacious to argue that Boko Haram is a political tool of Northern Nigerian elites who were unhappy with the President Goodluck Jonathan administration. The 2009 clashes between Boko Haram and security forces that marked the group as a serious threat to Nigerian security pre-dated the Jonathan administration. It was a Northerner, Umaru Yar'Adua, who was president of the country at that time. Moreover, given the opportunity, Boko Haram will go after the elites as ferociously as it has gone after ordinary Nigerians. Its January 2013 attempt to assassinate the former Emir of Kano, Ado Bayero, during which the Emir's driver and some of his loyal bodyguards were killed, is a testament to its loathing and disdain of the elites. This was also attested to when the group warned the elites in Sokoto to avert the replication of the Kano attack by releasing its members who had been detained in that state.

He vowed in March 2012 that the insurgency would be defeated by June that year, but this did not happen. By August 2014, Boko Haram was operating with impunity, seizing many towns and villages. It intensified its attacks, and it increased the frequency of such attacks. Its ability to strike well beyond the geography of its home base was expanded with its attacks on Kano, Kaduna, Abuja and other cities several hundred miles from its home base. By the end of 2014, its ability to strike terror into the hearts of many Nigerians and its ability to seize swathes of territories at will made the north-eastern region and several other parts of northern Nigeria virtually ungovernable.

As Gambrill and Reiman (2011) have noted, propaganda aims to promote ideas and actions that would serve the interests and benefits of those promoting the ideas and actions. The word, propaganda, was derived from Sacra Congregatio de Propaganda Fide (Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith), a Vatican organization, created in Rome on June 22, 1622 by Pope Gregory XV (Bernays, 1928; Jackall, 1995; Pratkanis & Aronson, 2001) . The organization's duty was to spread the faith and to regulate church affairs in heathen lands. Therefore, the Roman Catholic Church used the term first (Black, 2001) . Combs and Nimmo (1993) pointed out that this early form of propaganda was considered as \"a moral endeavor by the church\" (p. 201), but interest in the subject today has expanded owing to its importance in international politics (Chapman, 2000) . According to Lasswell (1927a Lasswell ( , 1927b , propaganda refers solely to the control of opinion by using pictures and other forms of social communication; it is concerned with the \"management of opinions and attitudes.\" Qualter (1962) argues that propaganda is the deliberate attempt by an individual or group of persons to form, control or alter attitudes of other individuals or groups. He suggests that propaganda is any form of persuasion aimed to change attitudes. Jowett and O'Donnell (2006) point out that \"Propaganda is a form of communication that attempts to achieve a response that furthers the desired intent of the propagandist\" (p. 7). They argue that the use of the terms propaganda and persuasion interchangeably is inappropriate-hence they propose that, in as much as propaganda makes use of persuasive strategies, it differs from persuasion in its purpose. Thus, they categorize propaganda as a specific class of communication that is a \"subcategory of persuasion, as well as information\" (pp. [6] [7] . British historian and scholar, Taylor (1979) , identifies three main reasons why propaganda gained prominence in international relations. These are:",

Focusing specifically on the targeting of telecommunications infrastructure by Boko Haram, Freedom Onuoha outlines the motivations behind Boko Haram's choice of targets. 22 Onuoha argues that by targeting telecommunications infrastructure, Boko Haram seeks to isolate the geographical areas of its attacks from the rest of the country.

Pinpointing connections between Boko Haram and other Islamic terrorist groups is also the subject of Machael Tanebam's long piece in the Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs. 28 Tanebam sees a direct link between Boko Haram and Al Qaeda, and argues that Islamic terrorism in both Mali and Nigeria represents the expansion of Al Qaeda to Africa.",

He notes that those identities have made the struggle more challenging. For Abimbola Adesoji, Islamic revivalism in Nigeria provides the best prism for analyzing and understanding Boko Haram. 30 To some Nigerian scholars, the biggest challenge posed by Boko Haram is its potential to disrupt the country's delicate ethnic and religious balance. Some even fear that the insurgency could lead to the break-up of Nigeria. Daniel Egiegba Agbiboa has analyzed Boko Haram from the perspective of religious identities in Nigeria. 31 He also uses the relative deprivation theory to examine Boko Haram's origins. 32 Jideofor Adibe, in his book Nigeria without Nigerians? Boko Haram and the Crisis in Nigeria's Nation-Building, 33 warns that an inability to suppress the insurgency could lead to the demise of Nigeria as a single political entity. He views Boko Haram as a frontal challenge to the desire of many Nigerians for a strong, viable and united country. Boko Haram's threat to national unity is also the subject of another volume by two Nigerians, Adeyemi Ademowo and Matthew Olusola. 34 Ademowo and Olusola analyze Boko Haram against the backdrop of Nigeria's fragile national unity. Similarly, Oluwaseun Bamidele has examined Boko Haram against the backdrop of the threats that it poses to Nigeria's peace and stability. He cautions that failure to rein in the insurgency could threaten peace, security and economic development in Nigeria.",

The Jihadist group presents itself as a fearful and marauding force that cannot be stopped by the incompetent, corrupt and visionless Nigerian state. Its leader, Shekau, in his propaganda videos intends to contrast the weak, inept and vacillating persona of then President Goodluck Jonathan with his bold and vigorous persona. Boko Haram recognizes the barbarity of its actions but uses social media to justify such actions in the name of Islam. It tries to convey the notion of the righteousness of its interpretations of Islam, and hence the legitimacy in the eyes of Islam of any of its atrocities.",

In the video, he states that Boko Haram began its insurgency with sticks and knives but has grown strong with its acquisition of armored personnel carriers, multi-purpose vans, AK47 and Pump Action riffles, heavy machine guns (HMGs), mortars, artillery shells, anti-aircraft guns, heat-seeking missiles, bombs, rocket-propelled grenades, hundreds of motorbikes, pick-up trucks and so on. As an evidence of Boko Haram's military strength, Shekau displays the groups's sophisticated assault weapons in some of his propaganda videos. The aim is to illustrate the sect's strength as well as persuade his followers to believe that Boko Haram is rich and wealthy-hence it can afford to purchase all these weapons. Ironically, Boko Haram leaders claim that the group does not condone Western civilization, but they make use of Western technological gadgets such as cellular phones and video recorders to disseminate their propaganda (Maiangwa, 2013 ). An added dramatic effect when they display these sophisticated weapons is the fact that some of them were seized from fleeing Nigerian soldiers.",

In the video, he warns that Boko Haram will bring Nigeria to its knees following which he will unleash a punitive attack on the neighboring countries of Cameroon, Chad, and Niger.

The airport remained closed to civilian aviation from December 2, 2013 until June 9, 2015.

It successfully attacked St Andrew's Military Protestant Church inside the college. On November 26, 2012, members of the sect attacked the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) police headquarters in Abuja, where they killed several Nigerian police officers before freeing scores of suspected criminals, including their own members who were detained in the facility. A BBC report of the incident titled \"Nigeria gunmen attack Abuja Sars police HQ\" may be found at: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20493739. Then, on December 28, 2012, Boko Haram fighters attacked and burned down the divisional police station, the prison, customs area office and the presidential lodge in Maiha, Adamawa State. They killed dozens of people in the attack, and freed scores of prison inmates. The Vanguard newspaper, one of the Nigerian dailies, reported the attack in its edition of December 28, 2012. On January 15, 2014, Boko Haram fighters attacked and sacked the police station in Banki, Borno state. In January 2014 alone, the jihadist group sacked thirty-seven communities in Kwaljiri, Kaya, Ngawo Fate, Limanti, Njaba, Yahuri, Mude, Wala, and Alau, among others in Damboa, Konduga and Gwoza council areas in the north-eastern part of Nigeria. In those attacks, members of the group killed thousands of people and many more were forced to take refuge in neighboring villages in the Republic of Cameroon and other Nigerian towns. An editorial in the November 13, 2014 issue of the Guardian, one of Nigeria's leading newspapers, pointed out that \"there were in Cameroun alone, 33,000 Nigerians that fled Gwoza, a town in Borno State\u2026.\" In January 2015, the jihadist group attacked Baga and killed hundreds of its residents. Amnesty International has published aerial photographs of Baga town before and after the attack to illustrate the mayhem Boko Haram unleashed on the town. The \"before\" images taken on January 2, 2015 were part of its report on the atrocities, while the aftermath was documented in pictures taken on January 7.

Another video it utilized to scare Nigerians was made in November 2014, following its successful attack and destruction of Vintim, hometown of the then Chief of Defence Staff, of the Nigerian military, Air Vice Marshal Alex Badeh. The insurgent group burned down Badeh's country home as an illustration of its contempt for the Chief of Defence Staff and the Nigerian military that he represented.

Secondly, the video aimed to show that the Nigerian government was untruthful and could not be trusted. When Boko Haram abducted the girls, the Nigerian government at first denied that the group had successfully done so. The wife of the president at the time, Patience Jonathan, as well as some government supporters, denied Boko Haram's claim that it had abducted the girls. Mrs Jonathan said that members of the opposition political party had fabricated the abduction story as a smear campaign against her husband, who was getting ready to run in the 2015 presidential election. Kema Chikwe, a prominent leader of the then ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP), added her voice to President Jonathan's wife's denial. As Chikwe contended that Boko Haram did not abduct any girls in the school, on April 30, 2014 she challenged the authorities of the school to release the names and pictures of the girls as a proof of the abduction. Chikwe's comments were published in the May 1, 2014 issue of National Leadership, one of Nigeria's dailies. According to the paper, Chikwe said: \"There are many questions to be asked and many more to be answered. How did it happen? Who saw it happen? Who did not see it happen?\"",

            "text": "The euphoria that greeted the government's claim had hardly died down when Shekau appeared in a two-minute video which was released to the French news agency (AFP), debunking the government's claim as false. In the video Shekau assures his audiences that he is alive and that only the Allah (God Almighty) could take his life, not the Nigerian government. In the video, he says: \"I am alive. I will only die the day Allah takes my breath.\" The video can be seen at (http://search.tb.ask.com/search/video.jhtml?searchfor= Boko+Haram+in+camouflage+outfits&p2=%5EUX%5Exdm297%5EYYA %5Eus&n=780bb3a2&ss=sub&st=tab&ptb=EA9E0994-1131-4ABE-93A6-C018E0796C80&si=245051&tpr=sbt). Shekau also used this propaganda video to subliminally persuade his followers and audiences that he is invincible and unpredictable. In the video, he lashes out at the then Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan and other world leaders, including Barack Obama, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Benjamin Nethanyahu, Angela Merkel and David Cameron. These authors accessed the video at http://search.tb.ask. com/search/video.jhtml?searchfor=Boko+Haram+in+camouflage+outfits&p 2=%5EUX%5Exdm297%5EYYA%5Eus&n=780bb3a2&ss=sub&st=tab&p tb=EA9E0994-1131-4ABE-93A6-C018E0796C80&si=245051&tpr=sbt. In a different video, Shekau warns Western leaders that the Jihadist group will \"enslave\" all supporters of Hollande and Obama: \"Whoever supports Hollande and Obama, as they supported Bush and Clinton before, and supported the state of Jewish Israel, he is an enemy and a target to us and we will enslave him and sell him in the markets.\" He says that Boko Haram will unleash deadly attacks on those who believe in the democratic system of government. The video can be accessed at http://universalfreepress.com/ boko-haram-leader-threatens-enslave-supporters-obama/. Baines and O'Shaughnessy (2014) , Qualter (1962) , Ellul (1965 Ellul ( , 1981 , Taylor (1979) , Jowett and O'Donnell (2006) and others have pointed out that propaganda is a form of communication that attempts to achieve a response that furthers the desired intent of the propagandist. This is what Shekau intended to achieve with his propaganda videos. He distributed them to the powerful European news wire services as well as via different social media platforms, so they would receive maximum global attention.",

Unlike other terrorist organizations, Boko Haram did not use social media as a primary tool to recruit followers but primarily to convey a message about its ruthlessness vicuousness and its total disdain for the Nigerian government. It utilized its messaging to showcase its military prowess and the invincibility and nine lives of its leader, Shekau. Boko Haram employed social media to excoriate the Nigerian government for its ineptness, corruption, deceitfulness and incompetency. So long as Boko Haram achieved military successes against the Nigerian armed forces, its ability to use the social media to its advantage was immense. Each spectacular military victory enhanced Boko Haram's social media messaging of brutality and military efficiency.",

Moreover, the inability of the armed forces to crush Boko Haram under deadlines imposed by the government itself ended up reinforcing Boko Haram's claim that it could not be defeated. Boko Haram's ability to infiltrate the army, and the enormous corruption involving the purchase of arms to fight the terrorist group, all aided Boko Haram's success in depicting the Nigerian government as an inept and clueless entity.",

The jihadist's fundamental message of its sheer brutality and invisibility was credible so long as Nigerian soldiers were fleeing in disarray from the terrorist group. However, as new military commanders, including Lieutenant-General Yusuf Buratai, the Chief of Army Staff, took over and began to take the fight to Boko Haram, the tables were turned against it. For over a year, Shekau was not heard from. He has begun to speak again but his threats now sound hollow. Although Boko Haram continues to launch deadly attacks, it has been uprooted from all the towns and villages which it had captured from Nigerian forces. In addition, it has been driven out of Sambisa Forest, which for many years served as its operational base for attacks. Shekau is now on the run and even his leadership of the group has been threatened from within. Boko Haram's serious military setbacks have not totally silenced its social media propaganda but its loud and boastful braggadocio has been reduced to an occasional whimper. As has been the case of IS, military defeats blunt the allure of terrorist propaganda. They demystify terrorists and their seeming ruthless efficiency and invisibility. Initially, Nigeria did not have a credible means to counter Boko Haram's social media messaging but militarily routing of Boko Haram has proven to be the most effective response to the group's reign of terror both on the battlefield and on social media.",

Terrorism cannot be curbed unless terrorists and their organizations are well understood. Social media messaging by extremist groups provide an important avenue for understanding terrorist groups' world views, goals and objectives. We have utilized the analysis of Boko Haram's social media messaging to demonstrate how this vicious and ruthless terrorist group has used social media to illuminate itself and what it stands for. ",
