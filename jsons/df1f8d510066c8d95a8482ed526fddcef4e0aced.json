Serological assays can complement diagnostic strategies focusing on the identification 71 of the infectious agent during the acute phase of disease. Unlike RT-PCR, they can identify 72 infected individuals that remained asymptomatic or undiagnosed, which are both frequent 73 conditions during SARS-CoV-2 infection, long after the initial infection. Validated serological 74 assays are also key to understanding the (immuno)-pathophysiology of COVID-19 in various 75 patients' groups and will be critical to characterize responses elicited by the numerous vaccine 76 candidates in development (1) . 77",

Such 370 factors could potentially explain why some samples were negative by ELISAs but positive by 371 rIFA, as the whole-spike protein is used in rIFA. Secondly, we strongly emphasize two important 372 cut-off limitations related to the analytical imprecision. At the level of the analytical imprecision, 373 the SARS-CoV-2 IgG intra-individual biological variation being unknown, we had to use the LSC 374 instead of the reference change value (22), which most likely would have translated into a 375 higher seropositivity cut-off. Along the same line, because the intra-lot imprecision of the 376 reagents is still undetermined, but expected to be higher than 15%, this could have a similar 377 impact on cut-off determination. Nevertheless, these cut-offs implemented in routine testing at 378 the Geneva University Hospitals (GE-cut-offs) proved useful in the management of a number of 379 clinically compatible COVID-19 patients with negative PCR results. 380 Importantly, this study is a diagnostic accuracy validation study and not a seroprevalence study. 381",

Indeed, the 100% PPV achieved in this study was due to combined effect of a 100% 383 specificity and a 1:1 distribution of control and samples form patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 384 PCR. Therefore, in population seroprevalence studies with a lower expected proportion of 385 COVID-19, the PPV at the 1.5 cut-off will likely decrease. In this context, increasing the rule-in 386 IgG cut-off to a higher value or using a secondary specific confirmatory assay may become 387 necessary. Due to this limitation, at this stage we recommend the confirmation of all positive 388 ELISA results (including ratios above 1.5) using a second serological assay such as rIFA for 389 seroprevalence studies with a low pre-test probability, and the confirmation of doubtful ELISA 390 results in settings with a pre-test probability around 50%.

These results parallel the ones obtained by two other 321 smaller studies (8) , (17), which tested the non CE-marked ELISA version and showed potentially 322 better diagnostic performances of IgG compared to IgA ELISA but lower AUCs compared to this 323 study. Our improved results might result from the higher number of negative controls and 324COVID-19 patient sera tested, and from the decreased non-specific background relative to that 325 observed in the earlier studies. Despite the greater performance of the IgG based ELISA, it was 326 reassuring to see that the IgA results correlated well with the IgG results and gave very similar 327AUCs upon ROC analyses.
