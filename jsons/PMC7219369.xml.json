Different from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV), two other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (CoVs) causing global epidemics in 2002, or continuous human infections (Zhong et al., 2003, Zaki et al., 2012, Du et al., 2009), SARS-CoV-2 has superior human-to-human transmission with rapid spread in humans (Zhu et al., 2020). Currently, no vaccines or therapeutics are available to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2-associated human infections, calling for immediate efforts to develop effective countermeasures to control COVID-19 (Jiang et al., 2020a; Jiang, 2020).",

It consists of two subunits: S1 subunit binds cells expressing viral receptor through the receptor-binding domain (RBD), whereas S2 subunit mediates fusion between the virus and cell membrane (Liu et al., 2004; Du et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2014). Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its cellular receptor, and its RBD (residues 331-524) shares about 70% sequence identity with SARS-CoV RBD (Zhou et al., 2020). SARS-CoV spike (S) protein RBD is an important vaccine and therapeutic target, and it induces potent neutralizing antibodies against divergent strains of SARS-CoV infection (Du et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2004; He et al., 2004).",

In this study, we detected their cross-reactivity with a SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein, as well as their cross-neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated viral entry. We found that six mAbs cross-reacted with SARS-CoV RBD, two of which could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in human ACE2 (hACE2)-expressing 293T cells (hACE2/293T), and one of which blocked the binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 receptor. The cross-reactivity of these mAbs with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, their cross-neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection, and their inhibition to block the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 binding were illustrated in Figure 1\n. We also identified the potential epitopes on the RBD of SARS-CoV recognized by these two mAbs. Our study provides the possibility of treating SARS-CoV-2 infection using SARS-CoV RBD-targeting neutralizing mAbs (nAbs).",

Fresh medium was added 24 h later, and the cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) 72 h after infection.

Among the mAbs tested, 7B11 and 18F3 could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection with about 80% neutralization at 10 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 2C). However, all these mAbs neutralized SARS-CoV pseudovirus infection, most of which had >50% neutralizing ability at 10 \u03bcg/ml, and a few reached >50% neutralization at 1 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 2D).

We have previously shown that 13B6 may recognize epitopes at residues R441 and D454 of SARS-CoV RBD (He et al., 2006a). Here, we constructed a series of SARS-CoV RBD mutant proteins based on the interaction between the RBD and viral receptor (Li et al., 2005), and performed an ELISA to test binding ability of the above mAbs to these mutant proteins. Compared with the binding to SARS-CoV RBD wild-type (WT) protein, neither 13B6 nor 18F3 bound to the RBD containing D392 and V394 mutations. Moreover, 13B6 did not bind to the RBD containing D414 and F416 mutations, and 7B11 did not bind to the RBD containing I428 and A430 mutations or the RBD containing K439 mutation (Fig. 3\n). In addition, 13B6 showed reduced binding to the RBDs containing V369/A371, A371/K373, or Y481 mutations (Fig. 3). This line of evidence suggests that the above residues were the epitopes recognized by respective mAbs, among which residues D392 and V394 in SARS-CoV RBD were conserved neutralizing epitopes corresponding to residues D405 and V407 in SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and residues I428, A430, and K439 in SARS-CoV RBD were neutralizing epitopes not fully conserved in SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig. 4\nA).",

Different from 7B11, which blocked the binding between both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to their respective ACE2 receptor, the results revealed that 13B6 and 18F3 could not block such binding (Fig. 4B, C). This might be due to that most or all epitopes recognized by 13B6 or 18F3 did not overlap with the ACE2 binding sites on SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Li et al., 2005; Yan et al., 2020), while most epitopes recognized by 7B11 were very close to the ACE2 binding sites (Fig. 4A).

Anti-SARS-CoV-RBD mAbs bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD in the S protein. Some of these mAbs directly neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection before its entry to host cells expressing ACE2 receptor, or blocked the binding of RBD to ACE2 receptor on the cell membrane.",

(A) Cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV RBD mAbs with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein. (B) Reactivity of these mAbs with SARS-CoV RBD protein was included as control. The binding of SARS-CoV RBD-specific mouse mAbs to SARS-CoV-2 RBD (A) or SARS-CoV RBD (B) protein was detected by ELISA. The data are presented as mean A450 value \u00b1 standard deviation of the mean (s.e.m.) (n = 3). (C) Cross-neutralizing activity of anti-SARS-CoV RBD mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 infection. (D) Neutralizing activity of these mAbs against SARS-CoV infection was used as control. Neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 (C) or SARS-CoV (D) infection was detected by a pseudovirus neutralization assay in human ACE2 receptor-expressing 293T (hACE2/293T) cells. The percent (%) pseudovirus neutralization was calculated based on the relative luciferase unit (RLU) of pseudovirus infection with and without respective mAbs. The data are presented as mean neutralization (%) \u00b1 s.e.m. (n = 3). For (A-D), SARS-CoV RBD-immunized mouse sera were included as positive control (Pos con) since we have confirmed their cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 RBD in previous studies (Tai et al., 2020), and MERS-CoV RBD-specific mAb was used as negative control (Neg con). Each mAb was detected at 10 and 1 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. The experiments were repeated twice and obtained similar results.",

SARS-CoV RBD-targeting nAbs (33G4 and 13B6) without cross-neutralizing activity were included as controls. The plates were coated with SARS-CoV RBD wild type (WT) or each mutant protein (1 \u03bcg/ml), and the mAbs at serial dilutions were added for binding. Arrows represent mAbs that did not bind to mutant proteins at the indicated amino acid residues on SARS-CoV RBD, which are epitopes recognized by the mAbs tested.

(A) Amino acid alignment of SARS-CoV RBD (residues 318-510) and SARS-CoV-2 RBD (residues 331-524) in S proteins and mapping of epitopes recognized by SARS-CoV RBD-specific nAbs with (18F3 and 7B11) and without (13B6) cross-neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The alignment was performed using Clustal Omega. The identified mAb epitopes on SARS-CoV RBD and the residues corresponding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were labeled in red with respective mAbs shown underneath. Letters in cyan represent receptor ACE2-binding residues and their locations in SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Li et al., 2005; Yan et al., 2020). (B) Inhibition of SARS-CoV RBD-specific mAbs for the binding of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 receptor by flow cytometry analysis. Percent (%) inhibition was calculated based on the relative fluorescence intensity with or without respective mAbs at 10 and 1 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 RBD (2 \u03bcg/ml) was used for the binding to hACE2/293T cells. The data are expressed as mean inhibition (%) \u00b1 s.e.m. (n=3). The experiments were repeated twice and obtained similar results. (C) Representative flow cytometry images of SARS-CoV RBD-specific mAbs (10 \u03bcg/ml) in inhibition of the binding between SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 receptor. The binding of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 RBD (2 \u03bcg/ml) to hACE2/293T cells is shown in red line, and the blockage of this binding by mAbs (33G4, 13B6, 18F3, and 7B11) is shown in blue line. hIgG-Fc protein (background control) was shown in gray shade.",
