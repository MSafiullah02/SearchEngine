He had a symptom of coughing before boarding and was diagnosed as COVID-19 infection on February 1 in Hong Kong. The first 10 cases were confirmed on February 4 after the ship arrived in Yokohama port.

We fitted the value of serial interval (mean and standard deviation) with a gamma distribution, as previously described (Li et al., 2020).

We estimated that distribution of R0 was about 2.28 (2.06\u20132.52), which had overlaps with a set of previously published estimates, ranging from 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4\u20133.9) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89\u20134.39) (Li et al., 2020, Zhao et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020), but lower than the reported estimate from a recent study with a large sample size, which suggested the R0 was 3.77 (95% CI 3.51\u20134.05). The wide range and the variability in R0 values reported by different studies indicate that precisely estimating R0 is quite challenging, because it is difficult to calculate the exact number of infected cases during an epidemic. Otherwise, the R0 value is affected by environmental circumstances, demography, statistical caliber, and modeling methodology (Delamater et al., 2019). In our study, the accuracy of estimated R0 is largely dependent on whether all the infected cases have been identified. According to the report from Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, all the suspected cases and cases who had close contact with confirmed cases had received viral nucleic acid testing. Therefore, the proportion of unidentified cases is supposed to be low. In contrast, prior published studies were mainly focused on the estimation of R0 in Wuhan, China (Li et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020). These estimates of R0 may be biased because a large population of infected cases were not identified during the early phase of disease outbreak. Another attractive feature of investigating the R0 on the ship is that the total number of population on board is relatively fixed, which perfectly matches the premise of epidemic models when studying the transmissibility of COVID-19 (Yan, 2008). Moreover, compared with prior studies (Li et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020), the driving force of zoonotic infection was absent among the population on the ship. Therefore, the R0 in our study only reflected the human-to-human transmissibility of COVID-19, rather than a composite of zoonotic and human-level transmissibility. Our findings suggested that the R0 was still high although quarantine measures have been taken on the ship, indicating that other transmission routes may be neglected, such as aerosol transmission via the central air conditioning system or drainage systems. The latter was thought to be the cause of the SARS-CoV outbreak in a building in Hong Kong in 2003 (Anon, 2020). Otherwise, unidentified asymptomatic cases or cases within incubation may also cause continuous spread of the novel virus, which may also partially explain why R0 was still high at this stage.",

According to our analysis, the daily incidence and the size of outbreak are largely dependent on the value of R0. If the R0 value remained unchanged, the cumulative number of infected cases may reach 1514 at the tenth day, suggesting more than forty percent of the population would be infected. Fortunately, the crew has taken more stringent measures to control the spread of infection. As a result, the transmissibility is expected to be reduced in the coming days. If the R0 value is reduced by 50%, the infected cases will be reduced by about half. If the R0 value can further be reduced to less than 1, the number of infectious disease cases will gradually taper off and finally perish. Our data-driven analysis highlights the importance of controlling the transmissibility among population at this stage.",

Therefore, our findings are constrained to a limited time frame and the result may be changed after a considerable number of cases were infected. Second, some confirmed cases were intentionally removed from the ship for treatment, and this measure would affect the natural process of disease transmission. If a considerable number of confirmed cases were removed, the computed R0 would be underestimated. Third, the prediction was based on the existing data from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare; a delay in case confirmation or reporting would result in an underestimation of R0.",
