This difference may have accounted for some variation in the antibody titer which was not indicative of specific viral infection. Antibody titer rises to multiple agents also may reflect heterotypic responses and overestimate the number of infections. By analyzing antibody titer rises to single agents in this report, we estimated the importance of infection with each specific virus, but the approach precluded assessment of the role of dual infection with two viruses or a virus and M. pneumoniae in exacerbations.
