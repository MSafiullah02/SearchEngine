However, public perception and awareness of HCoVs has shifted considerably in the last twenty years, with the onset of three high profile outbreaks that have garnered international attention and have subsequently led to renewed interest in potential therapeutic options for HCoV-related illnesses. In 2002\u20132003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infected more than 8000 people, reaching 26 countries and resulting in a 10% case fatality rate [3]. In the ~7 years between April 2012 and November 2019, there were 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that reached 27 countries and had a mortality rate of approximately 34% [4], though serologic studies have implied that the prevalence of MERS-CoV may have been underestimated [5]. Most recently, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 in Wuhan and its subsequent spread to over 160 countries across the world has generated intense interest in vaccine development and treatment options for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [6,7].",

Originally developed to treat Ebola virus infection [8], remdesivir is a prodrug of the parent adenosine analog, GS-441524 (Fig. 1b), both of which are metabolized into an active nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) by the host (Fig. 1c) [13]. The parent nucleoside, GS-441524, has displayed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV, Marburg virus, and feline infectious peritonitis virus, among others [9,[14], [15], [16]]. A number of studies have examined the effects of these two drugs on coronaviruses (CoVs) both in vitro and in vivo using mouse and non-human primate animal models [[9], [10], [11],13,17,18].",

            "text": "Viruses classified under the Coronaviridae family are enveloped positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that exhibit high genetic diversity [21]. Within the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, there are four genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus. Viruses in this family can infect a wide variety of host species, such as birds, humans, and non-human mammals, including dromedary camels, alpacas, domestic pigs, dogs, cats, ferrets, minks, and bats [5,11,12,16,[22], [23], [24]]. However, to our knowledge, only viruses of the alpha- and betacoronavirus genera infect humans [2], though those in the gamma- and deltacoronavirus genera have indirect effects through economic impacts on the agricultural production of poultry and pigs [12]. Host specificity is believed to be largely dependent upon variation in the CoV spike attachment glycoprotein [23]. Although the infectivity of most strains is host species-specific, host range is wide across different CoVs, and some bat CoVs rely on the same host receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme-2; ACE-2) as human CoVs to facilitate entry into cells [11,25,26]. It has been hypothesized that the CoV propensity for host-switching may partly be attributable to recombination events that alter the spike protein, which, in turn, affects interactions with host receptors (e.g., ACE-2) [27,28].",

            "text": "As a nucleoside analog, remdesivir acts as an RdRp inhibitor, targeting the viral genome replication process. The RdRp is the protein complex CoVs use to replicate their RNA-based genomes. After the host metabolizes remdesivir into active NTP, the metabolite competes with adenosine triphosphate (ATP; the natural nucleotide normally used in this process) for incorporation into the nascent RNA strand [32]. The incorporation of this substitute into the new strand results in premature termination of RNA synthesis, halting the growth of the RNA strand after a few more nucleotides are added. Although CoVs have a proofreading process that is able to detect and remove other nucleoside analogs, rendering them resistant to many of these drugs, remdesivir seems to outpace this viral proofreading activity, thus maintaining antiviral activity [30]. Unsurprisingly, Agostini et al. reported that a mutant murine hepatitis virus (MHV) devoid of proofreading ability was more sensitive to remdesivir [13]. The opposite is also possible\u2014that mutations that improve proofreading or otherwise increase fidelity of the base-pairing process may result in remdesivir resistance [33]. In fact, Agostini et al. also induced mutations in MHV (through passage in remdesivir) that conferred strong resistance against the drug, but these mutated strains were outcompeted by wild-type MHV in coinfected cell cultures that were not exposed to remdesivir [13]. How well this experiment would represent a situation in which a resistance mutation developed naturally, though, is unclear. Nonetheless, some evidence suggests that remdesivir could have an additional mechanism of action that has yet to be discovered, which, if true, may allow for partial antiviral activity to continue despite viral mutations that enhance replication fidelity [[11], [12], [13]].",

            "text": "Further, this study detected a weaker antiviral effect against porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV; Table 1), particularly when tested in porcine cell lines. Among currently known CoVs, PDCoV has the least similar RdRp sequence compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (only 67\u201369% similarity in amino acid sequence) [12]. In fact, the RdRp of PDCoV has a different amino acid at a specific site (phenylalanine to leucine at residue 483), a dissimilarity that has been previously associated with increased resistance to remdesivir in other CoVs [12,13]. Therefore, it was important to attempt to disentangle whether the lower antiviral activity observed could be related to a viral characteristic of PDCoV or if it could be attributable to differences in the cell lines used. While diminished potency of remdesivir against PDCoV was noted in cultures of porcine kidney epithelial cells (LLC-PK1), in a human liver cell line (Huh7), the EC50 was relatively low (EC50 not reached in LLC-PK1 vs. EC50 = 0.02 \u03bcM in Huh7; Table 1). Similarly, the EC50 was substantially higher for antiviral activity against an endemic HCoV (229E) in the porcine cell line (3.8 \u03bcM compared to 0.02 \u03bcM in Huh7), again indicating the likely lower potency of the drug in this context. Thus, the observed variations in remdesivir potency against the same viruses in the different cell lines may imply that there is some factor associated with the cell line, rather than the virus, that may be affecting the drug's antiviral activity. In fact, the authors state that these findings may imply that LLC-PK1 cells lack a cellular process necessary for remdesivir antiviral activity, which could also support the hypothesis that remdesivir may have another mechanism of action that is not presently understood.",

Interestingly, among mice that were infected with a higher virus quantity (i.e., more plaque-forming units), those receiving prophylactic remdesivir one day before infection had significantly better 6-day survival than infected control mice that did not receive remdesivir. However, the mice were sacrificed before longer follow-up data could be obtained. Similarly, in a rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV pathogenesis, prophylactic and therapeutic administration of remdesivir demonstrated favorable results, reducing respiratory tract viral titers and pulmonary pathology [18]. Prophylactic use was initiated 24 h prior to viral challenge, whereas therapeutic use was initiated 12 h after challenge. While respiratory rate was not substantially different between the prophylactic, therapeutic, and control groups, x-ray scores, representing the severity of pulmonary infiltrates, were significantly better in the prophylactic and therapeutic groups, comparing each to controls [18]. Incidentally, remdesivir has also been associated with beneficial effects, including reduced severity of respiratory signs and improved survival, against challenge with Nipah virus, which is a non-CoV virus in the Paramyxoviridae family, in African green monkeys [21].",

Controls were not included, as historical data on untreated cats were available, demonstrating a mortality rate close to 100% [14,36]. After experimental challenge with the FIP virus, 2 cats did not develop FIP-related signs and remained untreated [14]. In the 10 infected cats, treatment was initiated upon onset of FIP-associated clinical signs (~10\u201318 days post infection), and continued for 2 weeks. Of these cats, half (n = 5) were treated with a 5 mg/kg dose of GS-441524 administered subcutaneously once per day, and the other half (n = 5) were treated with 2 mg/kg daily. If disease recurred after initial treatment, cats were re-treated using the same regimen for another 2 weeks. Follow-up continued for 8 months. All treated cats demonstrated favorable responses to GS-441524 treatment within 24\u201348 h, regardless of dose, and were still alive and clinically unremarkable 8 months post infection. Two cats (one from each dose group) experienced disease recurrence at 4 weeks and 6 weeks after initial treatment and were re-treated. Adverse events related to treatment, other than temporary discomfort at the injection site, were not observed. This study was based on a small number of animals, and it is unclear whether experimental infection is a relevant representation of naturally-occurring FIPV infection in cats. Future studies with additional follow-up time would be helpful for assessing whether unexpected long-term sequelae are observed in the cats, since such information on surviving animals is sparse given the high fatality rate.",

The remaining cats completed at least 12 weeks of treatment, but 8 experienced relapses requiring re-treatment with GS-441524. Dose escalation from 2 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg daily was required for 5 cats. A total of 25 treated cats (81%) survived FIP for at least 44 weeks of follow up, indicating that GS-441524 (and presumably, its prodrug remdesivir) is also a promising therapeutic candidate for treatment of alphacoronavirus-related disease in cats. Most cats in this study had \u201cwet\u201d or effusive FIP, the hallmark of which is the accumulation of fluids in the abdominal or thoracic cavities. There were only 3 cats in the study with abdominal non-effusive (\u201cdry\u201d) FIP, which is a more chronic condition, and another 4 cats initially had dry FIP that progressed into wet FIP. One cat in the dry FIP group and one in the dry-to-wet group did not survive. Because of the small number of cats with dry FIP, conclusions cannot be drawn about whether remdesivir has greater efficacy in the treatment of some clinical manifestations of FIP than others. A strength of this study is that it was conducted among animals with naturally-occurring CoV infection as a field trial, better representing real-world circumstances.",

In addition to this issue, there are a number of factors that can impact how predictive findings from in vitro or in vivo models may be of clinical efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. For example, drugs that may be effective in vitro may not have clinical utility if the therapeutic dose induces severe adverse events in the patient. Alternatively, if the treatment dose does not attain an effective serum concentration in patients, or if EC50 is greater than the achievable maximum serum concentration (Cmax), then the drug is less likely to have therapeutic utility. With regard to animal models, how closely the model represents disease pathogenesis and drug metabolism in humans can be challenging to gauge.",

The NIH-sponsored clinical trial, ongoing in the U.S. and the Republic of Korea, is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in which patients are randomized to receive either placebo or an initial dose of 200 mg of intravenous remdesivir on the first day, followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg per day, through discharge up to a maximum of 10 total treatment days [20]. The primary outcome of the trial, as described in the U.S. National Library of Medicine clinical trials registry, will be expressed as the proportion of patients in each category of a seven-category clinical severity scale on the fifteenth day post treatment initiation (Table 2) [42]. Additionally, Gilead Sciences is sponsoring a remdesivir study among patients with severe COVID-19 with a composite primary outcome measure of fever normalization and oxygen normalization [43].",

In general, there are many reasons why favorable preclinical data can fail to translate directly into human clinical trial results [46], such as inadvertent use of irrelevant models, inability to achieve effective serum drug concentrations in patients, or the occurrence of unanticipated severe adverse events among patients. Therefore, postulating on expected results of the trials is extremely challenging.",

Another well-known candidate that is being evaluated in multiple trials against COVID-19 is chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), which is already approved as an antimalarial (and for extraintestinal amebiasis) [41,48]. Results of the clinical trials currently underway in the U.S. and China will provide crucial information about whether remdesivir represents a viable treatment option for COVID-19 [20,49]. If the trial findings are ultimately positive, it will be imperative to ensure that the drug is produced on a commercial scale capable of meeting the demand generated by both the current pandemic and future outbreaks. Such a change in production may also allow for the added benefit of the drug becoming more available for agricultural and veterinary use for relevant indications.",
