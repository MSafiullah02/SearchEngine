            "text": "Rhinoviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and influenza viruses are commonly encountered respiratory viruses responsible for causing most respiratory tract disease in human populations 1, 2. Viruses from these families infect, replicate and spread in the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract mucosa. Infection of upper respiratory tract regions, such as the nasopharynx, the paranasal sinuses and the Eustachian tubes of the inner ear, can cause characteristic symptoms of the common cold, including rhinorrhea, coryza and otitis media. Virus infection of the lower respiratory tract results in the worsening of pulmonary symptoms, including coughing, tachypnoea, laboured breathing and an audible wheeze. However, it is bronchiolitis and pneumonia (infection and inflammation of the distal bronchiolar airways and alveolar lung regions, respectively) that results in the most severe and potentially life\u2010threatening pulmonary disease. Bronchiolitis causes obstruction of the already narrow diameter lumens of the bronchiolar airways, reducing normal airflow through the bronchioles. Airway constriction, in addition to the obstructive event, may also be a contributing factor to functional narrowing of the small airways, and occurs in subgroups of older infected infants. Airway obstruction causes a reduced capacity for exhalation, leading to lung gas trapping, lung hyperexpansion, increased respiratory rates and rapid decline in lung function. Additionally, the trapped air is resorbed, causing micro\u2010 and subsegmental atelectasis, which results in worsening lung disease, ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch and further hypoxaemia due to intrapulmonary shunting. Respiratory viruses can also cause pneumonia, either directly, by infecting the alveolar epithelium, or by spillover of distal airway inflammation into the alveolus. Resulting alveolar inflammation, injury and oedema hinders efficient alveolar gas\u2010exchange processes, resulting in severe pulmonary disease, including hypoxia, respiratory failure and death.",

Indeed, acute bronchiolitis is so common in early life that it remains the single most common reason for infants and young children to be admitted to hospital 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Why respiratory virus infection so frequently progresses from clinically manageable involvement of the upper respiratory tract to the more severe involvement of the lower respiratory tract is largely attributed to the immature immune systems of young naive hosts and the general lack of functionally RSV\u2010protective maternal transplacental antibody. Another explanation for why infant lungs are more likely to develop severe distal airway disease is the smaller dimensions of the airways of the infant lung. Specifically, the average diameter of an adult respiratory bronchiole is approximately 250 \u00b5m, compared to 120 \u00b5m for those of a 2\u20134 month\u2010old infant, thus greatly increasing the potential impact of obstruction on the infant bronchiolar lumen during virus\u2010induced cytopathology and inflammation 10, 11. The infant lung also has poor development of collateral ventilation of alveolar regions, which in adult lungs enables the ventilation of lung regions experiencing obstructed airflow 11. Therefore, the immature immune system, combined with the smaller physical dimensions of the airways, is a logical explanation of why infants are more likely to develop severe distal airway disease during respiratory virus infection than older children or adults.",

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a notorious cause of infant bronchiolitis, so much so that young children with symptoms of severe airway disease occurring during a predictable winter epidemic will often be assumed by clinicians to be infected by RSV, even before identity of the aetiological agent has been confirmed. Of infants and young children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, 60\u201380% will be infected by RSV 4, 5, 6. RSV also causes more severe and prolonged bronchiolitis compared to that caused by other aetiologies, including rhinoviruses or the closely related human metapneumoviruses or parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 12, 13. A recent study of young children with acute respiratory illness found that those infected with RSV had twice as many emergency room visits and six times more hospitalizations than those with seasonal influenza virus infections 14. The importance of RSV is further highlighted by the observations that when multiple potentially pathogenic viruses are identified along with RSV in an infant with bronchiolitis, the disease course and severity are indistinguishable from those caused by infection by RSV alone.",

Very young age (<3 months) at the time of infection, premature birth, underlying immunodeficiency or underlying cardiopulmonary disease are important risk factors for severe RSV disease. Of these, very young age at the time of infection is the most significant, with 80% of hospitalized RSV\u2010infected infants under the age of 2 months being previously healthy 5, 12, 15. Why RSV has an increased propensity to cause more frequent and more severe bronchiolitis in previously healthy infants is due to both increased population exposure to infection from the virus at early ages and also to increased likelihood of severe disease once infected. The underlying reason for this increased severity of individual infections with RSV is unclear. Epidemiological studies suggest that environmental exposure of infants and young children to respiratory viruses is no more common for RSV than for other viruses, especially considering the high frequency of exposure to rhinoviruses 2, 16.",

Significant understanding of the genetic and biological properties of RSV, and how infection impacts host cells, has been achieved since the virus was first isolated 50 years ago 17. However, the precise details of how RSV infection causes bronchiolitis are poorly understood. Here, we focus on the current knowledge of RSV bronchiolitis and describe animal models which may provide further understanding of how RSV causes distal airway disease. By describing pathological outcomes of RSV infection of bronchiolar airways obtained from natural RSV infection of humans and experimental models, we aim to define hallmark features of RSV bronchiolitis. Finally, we discuss recent data from our own laboratory suggesting that expression of specific RSV\u2010encoded genes may, in part, be responsible for the increased propensity of RSV to infect, spread and cause severe obstructive bronchiolar airway disease. We focus our discussions of RSV infection on distal bronchiolar airways, as this pathology is responsible for the most severe and life\u2010threatening aspects of disease associated with RSV infection.",

Although RSV infects humans of all ages, it is the very young, the immunocompromised and the elderly who experience the most severe consequences, and RSV\u2010associated severe airway disease remains the most common reason why previously healthy infants and young children will require hospitalization. Of the US birth cohort, 2\u20133% become hospitalized for RSV within their first year of life. One\u2010third of infants, likely by avoiding exposure, avoid infection during their first winter, only to become infected in their second winter, but by the age of 3 years all children will have experienced at least one RSV infection 3. World\u2010wide, RSV is estimated to be responsible for 34 million new paediatric cases of distal airway disease annually, resulting in approximately 200 000 paediatric deaths/year 5. While such RSV\u2010associated mortality rates are observed in countries with underdeveloped health care, in the USA and other developed countries, RSV mortality rates are significantly lower, due to the availability of appropriate hospital\u2010based supportive care and the safety net of mechanical ventilation. Nevertheless, RSV infection maintains a significant health burden on the US population, with an estimated 1.5 million outpatient visits/year attributable to RSV infections in the under\u20105 year\u2010olds, and 75 000\u2013125 000 hospitalizations, of which 1.5% (1500) require admission to paediatric intensive care units 5, 7, 8, 19. Appropriate supportive care for hospitalized RSV\u2010infected infants includes administration of supplemental oxygen and intravenous fluids, after which most RSV\u2010infected infants can be discharged, with an average hospital stay of 3.5 days 20, 21, 22.

However, diagnosis of acute RSV bronchiolitis, while often assumed, cannot be confirmed until a positive identification of RSV in patient\u2010derived samples is obtained, since lower respiratory tract symptoms indicative of RSV infection can also be due a number of other respiratory viruses, including parainfluenza viruses, influenza viruses, coronaviruses, human metapneumoviruses and, in some cases, rhinoviruses. Common upper airway symptoms of RSV infection include nasal congestion, voluminous rhinorrhea, otis media and intermittent fevers. The progression to RSV severe lower respiratory disease occurs quickly, with the mean duration of symptoms prior to hospitalization and requirement for mechanical ventilation being only 4 days. Progression of RSV infection from the upper airways into the lower airways is presumed, but not proven, to be via mechanical aspiration of infectious material, resulting in a worsening of disease symptoms, including onset of moderate tachypnoea, diffuse rhonchi, fine rales and wheezing. At this point in infection, chest X\u2010rays are normal and the disease can resolve within 1\u20132 weeks. However, further spread of infection into distal airway regions results in exacerbation of pulmonary disease. Respiratory rates increase and coughing and wheezing become more significant, with the development of severe tachypnoea and chest hyperexpansion. At this point, radiological evidence of gas trapping and peribronchial thickening are common, in combination with interstitial pneumonia. The clinical diagnosis for these severe symptoms is acute bronchiolitis, with or without evidence of pneumonia. Such symptoms of acute bronchiolitis and pneumonia can also be attributed to distal airway infection by several different respiratory virus families, requiring RSV detection to confirm diagnosis of RSV bronchiolitis. Standard radiological techniques are unable to distinguish between acute bronchiolitis caused by RSV versus that caused by infection by other respiratory viruses. Indeed, a recent computed tomography (CT)\u2010based study, designed to compare and contrast scans of patients exhibiting acute, infectious, distal airway disease, was unable to discriminate between distal airway disease caused by several respiratory viruses, including RSV 23, 24.",

Common post\u2010mortem findings in RSV\u2010infected infant lungs are robust infection and cytopathology of the bronchiolar airway epithelium, with inflammatory cell infiltrates sufficient to constrict and obstruct the narrow\u2010diameter bronchiolar airway lumens (Figure 1). As early as 1965, Shedden and Emery 25 provided one of the first reports combining histopathology and RSV antigen localization in lung tissue from infants who had died from severe RSV airway disease. They showed that RSV antigen was localized predominately in the epithelial cells of the bronchiolar airways and the alveolar regions. Most notably, RSV infection of bronchiolar airway epithelium severely disrupted epithelial cell morphology, and large, multinucleated, polypoid epithelial cell masses were seen to protrude and slough into the infected bronchiolar lumen (Figure 1A). The authors described this observation as RSV infection causing 'bizarre giant cells to be cast off into the lumen of the bronchioles and alveoli'. Furthermore, the cast\u2010off giant cells retained RSV immunoreactivity and accumulated in the bronchiolar airway lumen, raising the possibility that this loose and infected cellular material may influence further spread of RSV infection.",

The conclusion was that RSV caused the greatest degree of bronchiolar involvement and that RSV\u2010infected bronchiolar airway epithelial cells exhibited a peculiar morphology, with \u2018RSV\u2010infected epithelial cells increasing in size and proliferating to result in nipple\u2010like outgrowths which occupy a considerable part of the bronchiolar lumen\u2019. Both studies also provided clear evidence of RSV infection of the alveolar epithelium causing epithelial cell damage, and an associated polymorphonuclear cellular accumulation within the airway lumen. Alveolar macrophages were also shown to contain RSV antigen, although whether these macrophages were productively infected by RSV or simply contained ingested RSV protein remains unknown. It also remains unknown whether a true infection of macrophages by RSV might contribute to disease progression via promotion of inappropriate pro\u2010inflammatory responses. Together, these two early histopathology reports provided the first evidence that RSV infection significantly disrupted the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium and altered, perhaps uniquely, the morphology of the epithelial cells in a manner which could potentially interfere with airflow to and from the lungs.",

RSV antigens localize almost exclusively to the ciliated and non\u2010ciliated columnar cells of the proximal and distal airways 27, 29, 30. In the larger cartilaginous airways, ciliated columnar cells were the predominant target of RSV infection, with mucin\u2010containing goblet cells and underlying basal epithelial cells not expressing RSV antigens. In the non\u2010cartilaginous distal airways, ciliated and non\u2010ciliated epithelial cells were infected by RSV, with more extensive infection of the epithelium often encompassing the entire circumference of the bronchiolar airway. As in earlier reports, these studies also noted airway epithelial cells positive for RSV antigen being sloughed or shed into the lumens of the infected airways, suggesting that infected and necrotic epithelial cells may contribute to the airway obstruction and inflammation during RSV infection 27, 28, 29. The infection of ciliated cells also implied that RSV\u2010induced ciliated cell cytopathology may negatively impact \u2018mechanical airway clearance\u2019 mechanisms, due to the loss of beating cilia on the apical surface. It was proposed that the loss of mechanical clearance in the very narrow distal airways of infants may lead to the accumulation and retention of sloughed necrotic cellular material in the bronchiolar airway lumens, thus providing a mechanism for acute obstruction of the distal airways.",

The precise composition of the material occluding the bronchiolar lumens is likely heterogeneous, even within bronchioles of the same patient, but most histopathology suggests that the obstructive material is largely cellular in nature, and describes accumulations of papilliary epithelial projections that protrude into the airway lumen, detached and necrotic epithelial cell debris, and intraluminal inflammatory cells, which are overwhelmingly neutrophils. Multinucleated cells or syncytial giant cells are another feature of RSV infection likely also to contribute to lumenal obstruction (Figure 1). Excessive secretions of mucus, fibrin deposits and other non\u2010cellular material are also described as components of the obstructive material 11 but are likely more minor components 27, 29. Although increased mucus secretion is a common consequence of RSV and other respiratory virus infections of the larger airway regions, the relative absence of secreted mucins in the obstructed bronchiolar airways infected by RSV likely reflects the limited cellular sources of secreted mucins, ie submucosal glands and mucin\u2010containing goblet cells, in distal airway regions especially those of infants.",

Fortunately, in the studies of Johnson et al\n27 and Welliver et al\n28, lung histopathology was obtained from deceased RSV\u2010infected infants who, although experiencing severe disease, had received no mechanical ventilation. The findings were remarkably similar to the other previously published reports. Another valuable source of RSV\u2010infected lung tissues are those obtained from immunocompromised individuals who have succumbed to RSV infection.

Neonatal and preterm lambs experimentally infected with ovine or human RSV strains by directly inoculating the lower airway regions results in robust bronchiolar airway infection and inflammation, with significant clogging of distal small airways by atypical epithelial cells and neutrophil\u2010rich inflammatory infiltrates 40, 41, 42, 43.

Although informative, these cells do not recapitulate the morphology, biology or structural properties of differentiated columnar airway epithelial cells \u2013 the primary target of RSV infection in vivo. Over the last decade there has been a significant increase in the availability of human differentiated airway epithelial cell culture models (HAE) used to investigate specific functions of the airway epithelium, such as mucociliary transport and how respiratory pathogens affect these functions 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59. To generate these culture models, nasal or tracheobronchial airway epithelial cells are isolated from airway tissues excised from deceased donors, or from airway scrapings from living donors. These epithelial cells are cultured on semi\u2010permeable supports to generate a differentiated pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium similar in morphology to human cartilaginous airways in vivo\n60, 61. Differentiated culture models of human airway epithelium are easily infected by RSV, and several groups have shown that RSV infection is robust and restricted to the ciliated columnar epithelial cells in these models 54, 57. Ciliated cell tropism in HAE is, however, not unique to RSV, since parainfluenza viruses (human PIV1\u20105, Sendai virus), human/avian influenza viruses and most coronaviruses also preferentially infect these cells 55, 58, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68. Non\u2010ciliated columnar cells, ie mucin\u2010secreting goblet cells, account for 10\u201330% of the columnar cells present in HAE and are resistant to infection by RSV, reproducing the known tropism of RSV in human airways in vivo\n54, 57.",

Histopathology of human bronchiolar regions naturally infected by RSV indicates that both ciliated cells and club cells are infected by RSV, suggesting expanded RSV tropism for both ciliated and non\u2010ciliated cells in the bronchiolar airway regions 27. The significance of expanded RSV tropism in the distal airways is unknown.

HAE models have been used to show that RSV infection causes cilia dyskinesia, loss of cilia structure and loss of ciliated cells themselves 54, 69, 70. We have recently shown that RSV infection inhibits the unidirectional transport of mucus secretions across the lumenal surface of HAE, with abnormal ciliary beating patterns observed as early as 24 h after infection and complete ablation of mucus transport occurring 3 days later 71. The ciliated cell cytopathology observed after RSV infection in vitro is remarkably similar to that seen in histopathological studies in the bronchiolar airways of humans, calves and lambs infected by RSV 27, 42, 45, 48. Nasal biopsies from infants with RSV\u2010associated bronchiolitis also showed decreased numbers of ciliated cells within the epithelium, increased numbers of cells detached from the epithelium, and abnormalities in ultrastructural features of cilia compared to uninfected controls 72. Combined, these studies suggest that ciliated cell cytopathology caused by RSV infection is predominately a direct consequence of virus replication, and not due to inflammation\u2010mediated injury, as inflammatory cell infiltrates are not present in HAE models.",

Effective mechanical clearance mechanisms are critical for the clearance of airway\u2010obstructive material, and impairment of these mechanisms may contribute to the prolonged distal airway obstruction noted in human infants infected by RSV 73.",

For example, the extent of ciliated cell cytopathology during RSV or Sendai virus infection was recently reported to be different 61. We have also shown striking differences in ciliated cell cytopathology after RSV infection compared to other respiratory viruses, including PIV3 71. Despite similar percentages of cells becoming infected, ciliated cell cytopathology was more rapid and extensive during RSV than during PIV3 infection. Strikingly, ciliated cells infected by RSV, but not PIV3, exhibited unusual morphology, with infected cells becoming rounded during the extrusion of the infected cells from the plane of the epithelium, resulting in significant numbers of shed cells accumulating in the lumenal surface secretions (Figure 2). As RSV and PIV3 replicate with similar life cycles, we predicted that these differences in ciliated cell morphology may be due to the expression of specific RSV genes. Infecting ciliated cells with RSV gene deletion mutants revealed that the unusual morphology was due to expression of a single RSV gene encoding the non\u2010structural protein 2 (NS2). Ciliated cell rounding and extrusion as a consequence of RSV NS2 expression was confirmed by infecting ciliated cells with PIV3 engineered to express RSV NS2 (PIV3\u2013NS2). Ciliated cells infected by PIV3\u2013NS2 were morphologically indistinguishable from those infected by RSV.",

            "text": "The in vivo significance of RSV NS2 expression was revealed by comparing infection of hamster airways with PIV3\u2013NS2 or PIV3. Throughout the airways, columnar epithelial cells infected by PIV3 were abundant and remained embedded in the airway epithelium until being cleared, presumably by inflammatory cell infiltrates. In contrast, airway epithelial cells infected by PIV3\u2013NS2 were most commonly observed shedding from the airway epithelium and, in the bronchiolar airways, the shedding cells accumulated in the narrow airway lumens. Shed cell accumulations consisted of intact and necrotic virus\u2010infected epithelial cells and, at later time points, abundant infiltrating neutrophils. Several histopathological features of this in vivo model were reminiscent of humans and large animal models (Figure 3). Epithelial cells infected by PIV3\u2013NS2 exhibited unusual and peculiar morphology as the infected cells were shed from the epithelium. Accumulations of shed and pleomorphic epithelial cells and infiltrated neutrophils in the bronchiolar airways were sufficient to partially or fully occlude the distal airway lumens. Also, as described for human bronchioles infected by RSV, secreted mucins were not detected in the obstructive material in PIV3\u2013NS2\u2010infected hamster bronchioles, at least as determined by AB\u2013PAS staining. Whether the lack of mucin in these bronchiolar accumulations reflects an absence of goblet cells in the hamster bronchioles, or whether it is a species\u2010dependent phenomenon, remains to be determined. Syncytia formation was also a common finding in PIV3\u2013NS2\u2010infected hamsters, while distinctly absent in PIV3\u2010infected animals. Shedding cells could often be seen fusing to other cells shedding in close proximity to each other, and forming elongated syncytia\u2010like cellular masses resembling the papillary projections described in humans, calves and lambs infected by RSV 27, 42, 45. Overall, these studies identified RSV NS2 as an important viral genetic determinant for much of the unusual histopathology observed in infants and animal models infected by RSV, and suggest that RSV NS2 expression may be one reason why RSV has an increased propensity for causing acute bronchiolar airway disease. Since cell\u2010associated RSV likely remains infectious, increased sloughing of columnar cells mediated by RSV NS2 expression may also increase the person\u2010to\u2010person spread of RSV within crowded human populations.",

            "text": "Studies of RSV pathogenesis have been historically limited because of the inability of animal models to recapitulate characteristics of human RSV infection, pathology and disease. Recent studies performed directly in naturally and experimentally infected infants and adults have helped uncover a more prominent role of direct viral\u2010induced cytopathology. Recent in\u2010depth in vitro studies of human airway epithelial cells have elucidated mechanisms of this cytopathic effect which appear unique to RSV. The capacity for RSV to cause exaggerated cytopathology in the bronchiolar airways of infants sheds light on why RSV may have increased propensity for causing more frequent and severe acute bronchiolitis. Increased RSV cytopathology, promoted largely by RSV NS2 expression, causes increased sloughing or shedding of infected epithelium, which accumulates in the narrow lumens of the bronchiolar airways. These cellular accumulations are likely to result in acute obstruction of the distal airways; an outcome much more likely to occur in the extremely narrow bronchioles of infants. The retention of accumulations of shed and infected epithelial cells due to the narrow lumenal diameter, combined with loss of mechanical clearance of these airways, likely leads to increased spread of infection, increased inflammation and increased disease symptoms. Much remains to be determined about how early RSV bronchiolar cytopathology manifests into severe enough bronchiolitis that the affected infant will require hospitalization. For example, it is unknown which factors determine whether acute RSV bronchiolitis will either spontaneously resolve or develop into more severe airway disease requiring hospitalization. Understanding why some RSV\u2010infected infants more effectively clear infection and inflammation from the distal airways to avoid more severe and prolonged disease will enable paediatricians to better identify those infants who would likely benefit more from hospitalization, and may provide clues for new therapeutic interventions for limiting the severity of RSV\u2010associated distal airway disease and the associated long\u2010term sequelae.",
