            "text": "In 2015, an estimated 2.7 million deaths worldwide (all ages) were attributable to lower respiratory infections [1] . While international surveillance for influenza viruses is routinely conducted for the purposes of developing seasonal vaccines, surveillance for non-influenza respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza virus (PIV), is less well established [2] . Recent publications have described these gaps in surveillance, recognizing the barrier of timely diagnostic testing and the need for the increased use of multiplexing molecular assays to enhance the sensitivity of respiratory virus detection [2, 3] . RSV, a single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus in the genus Pneumovirus in the Paramyxoviridae family has two antigenic subgroups, A and B, which can co-circulate but typically differ by season and region [4] . Estimates of the overall mortality among children due to RSV in 2015 range from 36,363 to 118,200 deaths globally [5, 6] . RSV has also been found to have a disease burden similar to that of non-pandemic Influenza A within elderly adult populations [7] . Worldwide, there are currently more than 50 RSV vaccine trials and nearly as many antiviral drug trials for RSV infection being evaluated in various phases of clinical trials [2, 3, [8] [9] [10] . Immune prophylaxis with targeted monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are now available for highrisk infants and children [11] .",

Sibu Hospital in Sarawak, Malaysia, has experienced increasing pneumonia admissions in recent years, with 1,611 admissions in 2013, 1,607 admissions in 2014, and 1,903 admissions in 2015. Sibu Hospital is a referral hospital for central Sarawak, with a bed capacity of 730, serving six other smaller district hospitals and a population of more than 725,400 in the central region of Borneo Island. A nearby district hospital, Kapit Hospital, while smaller, also sees a relatively large number of pneumonia admissions (approximately 300) per year considering the small rural population of 130,800 it serves. Kapit is located 120 kilometers south-east of Sibu, currently accessible only by boat. Kapit Hospital is a government hospital with 134 beds that serves as the referral hospital for several smaller towns along the Rajang River [13] . Until this study was conducted, the hospitals essentially have no onsite viral diagnostic capabilities.",

Inclusion and exclusion enrollment criteria were adapted from two United States, large and comprehensive, community-based pneumonia studies (supporting information S1 Table) . [14, 15] . All patients of more than 30 days of age admitted to Sibu or Kapit Hospitals were recruited after medical officers (MOs) assessed them for evidence of an acute respiratory tract infection consistent with pneumonia assessed by chest radiography, read by MOs, within 72 hours of hospitalization [14] . MOs from both hospitals were trained in enrollment procedures. Due to the dependency upon MOs for enrollment, this study used convenience sampling. Written informed consent was obtained from enrolled adults over 18 years of age and from parents or guardians of children under 7 years of age. Assent was obtained for those children enrolled between 7 and 18 years of age, along with written informed consent from their parents or legal guardians. MOs administered a questionnaire collecting demographic and risk factor data then collected and placed one nasopharyngeal swab into 3 mL of sterile viral transport medium. All specimens were stored at -80\u02daC until RNA extraction was performed using QIAmp Cador Pathogen Mini Kit (cat. 54106). Extractions (100 \u03bcL) were then stored in cryogenic vials in a -80\u02daC freezer until ready for real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Primers and probes were identified and validated following a literature review of van de Pol et al. (2007) [16] . Cycling conditions for the six singleplex assays were identical (supporting information S2 Table) . rRT-PCR was conducted on a BioRad CFx96 C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler Real-Time system. Cycle threshold (Ct) value cut-offs were determined based on a literature review: Ct values <38 were positive; Ct values 38 to 40 were considered suspect; and Ct values >40 were considered negative [16] [17] [18] [19] .

Pearson's chi-square test was used for categorical variables. Those predictors with a bivariate test statistic p-value 0.1 were included in a stepwise, backward elimination logistic regression model.

Our findings demonstrate RSV season may begin earlier than July, though data from an ongoing pneumonia study will provide a snapshot of year-long data on the seasonality of RSV in Sarawak, in addition to influenza viruses, adenoviruses, coronaviruses and enteroviruses. Because data collection occurred in June and July, the two months following the Gawai celebration in Sarawak, it is possible that community gatherings might have contributed to the increased prevalence of RSV infection. This would be especially true in Kapit, which is a smaller and more isolated town that attracts nonresident travelers during the Gawai celebration. The population of Kapit is largely made up of ethnic groups that reside in traditional or modern longhouses, with rows of private single-family units running perpendicular to a hall of public, communal space. Of the RSV-A patients in our study, 60% reported residing in households with six or more cohabitants; however, while the questionnaire captured household size, it failed to capture household type (longhouse versus single-family home). Though ethnicity was not found to be a statistically significant risk factor for RSV-A infection, 26 of the RSV-A positive patients were of Iban ethnicity (66.7%). As of 2010, approximately 28% of the population in Sibu was Iban and 82% of the population in Kapit was Iban; in this study, 58% of patients in Sibu were Iban and 88% of patients in Kapit were Iban. Among those patients hospitalized in Kapit, a remaining 4% were Malay and 8% were indigenous local populations, including the nomadic hunter-gatherer Penan people.",
