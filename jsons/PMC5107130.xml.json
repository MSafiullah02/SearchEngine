We now know that the enzyme responsible for this effect is cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase (CBS), a pyridoxal 5\u02bc-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme, expressed in various cells of the liver, kidney and the nervous system, where it plays a role in cysteine biosynthesis and degradation [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. CBS is unique among the PLP-dependent enzymes, as it also carries a N-terminal heme prosthetic group coordinated by Cys52 and His65 residues [7], [8]. Although heme is not required for enzymatic activity, its presence can affect its catalytic activity serving as a redox sensor. The C-terminal region of CBS exerts an auto-inhibitory function by partially shielding the active site that can be alleviated by S-adenosyl methionine binding [7], [8].",

Aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) is commonly referred to as a selective CBS inhibitor, even though it also inhibits another H2S-producing enzyme, cystathionine-gamma lyase (CSE) [20] as well as several transaminases [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. Previous efforts to identify CBS inhibitors from commercially available libraries yielded compounds with relatively low potency and limited CBS selectivity [26], [27]. For instance, a recent high-throughput tandem-microwell assay identified 1,6-dimethyl-pyrimido[5,4-e]-1,2,4-triazine-5,7(1H,6H)-dione (NSC67078) as a CBS inhibitor, which, however, also inhibited CSE with a potency that was only 3-fold lower [27]. In a further effort to identify CBS inhibitors, we have conducted a screen of a composite library of 8871 drugs and well-annotated pharmacological compounds. The screen identified several CBS inhibitors including benserazide. Additional studies demonstrated that benserazide is an effective inhibitor of colon cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor xenograft growth in vivo, suggesting its potential for therapeutic repurposing as an anti-tumor agent.",

Docking was performed using the IFD induced-fit docking protocol as implemented in Small-Molecule Drug Discovery Suite 2016 (Schrodinger Inc., Small-Molecule Drug Discovery Suite, 2016-1) [32]. The IFD algorithm involves the use of Glide and Prime modules for docking and refinement, respectively, and it enables modeling of structural changes in proteins as an effect of ligand binding. This is achieved by implementing an improved sampling approach where specific sidechain or backbone atoms are allowed to rearrange after iterative cycles of docking and protein refinement [33], [34]. In this case, the sidechains of Lys119 and Gln222 were trimmed and Van der Waals atom radii scaling were set to 1 for the protein and 0.8 for the docked ligands. Prior to calculations, the two PLP-benserazide derivatives were prepared in terms of correct protonation states, tautomerism and stereoisomerism using the LigPrep routine (Schrodinger Inc.). The crystal structure of human CBS (pdb id: 1JBQ) was utilized for docking calculations. Protein preparation was performed by the corresponding routine as implemented in Maestro (Schrodinger Inc.). Water molecules of the CBS crystallographic structure were retained according to the ProtPrep default settings.",

All compounds were screened at a concentration of 30 \u03bcM. Compounds that showed >50% CBS inhibition at 30 \u03bcM were considered potential hits. The number of potential hits varied between libraries. Some diversity collections (like LOPAC) yielded up to a dozen potential hits, some more specific collections (e.g. the ActiTarg P library or the PLP-dependent custom collection) didn\u2019t yield any potential hits. When a compound was represented in multiple libraries, it was positively identified as a potential hit compound multiple times, indicating the reliability of the screening assay. Individual CBS activities of all compounds tested (% of vehicle control), organized by libraries, are shown in Fig. 1\n. The PLP-dependent enzyme inhibitor compounds were also re-tested in a broader concentration-response range (10\u2013100 \u03bcM); no inhibitory effects were observed for any of them, except with 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine, which inhibited CBS activity by 24, 37, and 68%, at 10, 30, and 100 \u03bcM, respectively.

These four compounds were further characterized, along with the principal reference compound AOAA [20] and the secondary reference compound, NSC67078 [27]. Inhibitory effect of the two reference compounds and the four identified CBS inhibitors on recombinant CBS and on GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence are shown in Table 3\n; full concentration-response curves shown in Fig. 2\n. The structures of the six compounds (two reference compounds and four compounds identified by the screen as bona fide CBS inhibitors) are shown in Fig. 3\n. The CBS inhibitory effect of hexachlorophene, tannic acid, aurintricarboxylic acid, and benserazide were also confirmed using the methylene blue assay, which detects H2S production by a different principle than the AzMC assay (Table 3). Unexpectedly, the second reference compound CBS inhibitor NSC67078, in addition to inhibiting CBS-induced AzMC fluorescence with an IC50 of \u223c1 \u03bcM, also inhibited GYY6137-induced AzMC fluorescence with an IC50 of \u223c6 \u03bcM (Table 3, Fig. 2B) indicating that the observed inhibitory effects are due to a combination of direct CBS inhibition as well as H2S scavenging and/or interference with the assay used to detect H2S. While conducting confirmatory dose-response work with the four compounds identified as CBS inhibitors, we have noted the aqueous instability of benserazide: while freshly made solutions produced the inhibition depicted above, storage of benserazide stock solutions in aqueous media or DMSO diminished its activity. For instance, while freshly dissolved benserazide at 100 \u03bcM inhibited CBS activity by 66 \u00b1 1%, after preparing stock solutions in PBS or DMSO and storing them at \u221220 \u00b0C for 1 week, its potency decreased to 45 \u00b1 4% or 53 \u00b1 3% inhibition of CBS activity, respectively, at 100 \u03bcM (n = 3); these data are consistent with prior findings showing the oxidation-prone character of benserazide [35], [36].",

The effect of NSC67078 was also associated with a suppression of MTT conversion (Fig. 5).

However, ST012861 (a copper-free analogue of ST012942), failed to inhibit recombinant CBS activity (Fig. 10\nA), suggesting that copper itself may be the inhibitor of CBS activity.

A lesser degree of inhibitory effect was also noted on GYY4137- elicited AzMC responses (\u223c15% inhibition at 1 \u03bcM; IC50, \u223c1 \u03bcM). In fact, the effects of the copper-containing compound ST012942 and the effects of CuCl2 were overlapping, both on CBS- and GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence values (Fig. 10). To further investigate the role of CBS inhibition by copper we performed cell proliferation assay in the HCT116 cells. As shown in Fig. 11\n, copper only inhibited HCT116 cells proliferation at the highest concentration tested (1 mM), which also decreased MTT conversion and LDH activity. The paradoxical reduction in LDH activity is most likely the result of the previously reported [37] direct inhibition of the LDH enzyme by copper ions.",

To gain insight to the putative mode of CBS inhibition by benserazide, docking calculations were performed by considering the two distinct PLP-benserazide derivatives that could be potentially formed, with either of them potentially representing the actual inhibitor of the protein (Fig. 13\n). Compound 1 (Fig. 13A, top) is the derivative of the coupling between the free amine of the unmodified benserazide with the formyl functionality of PLP while compound 2 (Fig. 13A, bottom) is the derivative obtained by reaction of the major benserazide metabolite 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzylhydrazine with the respective moiety of PLP. Both molecules are expected to be relatively kinetically stable, as the resulting Schiff bases carry an aromatic ring substitution. Compound 1 and Compound 2 were docked to the PLP-binding site of CBS using an induced-fit docking protocol enabling additional flexibility and enhanced sampling for modeling structural rearrangements of the target upon binding. Docking results showed that although both molecules adopted a highly identical geometry with respect to each other and the crystallographic free PLP cofactor, the PLP-benserazide derivative 1 was systematically bound demonstrating moderately higher docking scores than the corresponding PLP-trihydroxybenzylhydrazine derivative 2 with respective differences of \u223c1 kcal/mol (best pose score: 1, \u22129.91 kcal/mol; 2, \u22128.83 kcal/mol). On this basis, the higher affinity predicted for 1 was attributed to the interaction geometry that permitted formation of additional hydrophobic contacts with the protein environment as well as extensive hydrogen bonding interactions between the trihydroxybenzyl ring and polar residues located at the periphery of the cavity such as His203, Tyr223 and Tyr308 with respect to the corresponding, less-favorable interaction geometry of 2 (Fig. 13B,C). While an equilibrium between the two different states of benserazide cannot be ruled out in the assay conditions, docking shows that the two molecules demonstrate a high structural convergence in terms of binding orientation.",

Based on these data we suggest that benserazide should be further explored with respect to its potential suitability for therapeutic repurposing for cancer. Additional data presented in the current report confirm previous findings [38], [39] demonstrating that copper is a direct inhibitor of CBS activity. Finally, we confirmed that the reference compound AOAA is a CBS inhibitor and antiproliferative agent in colon cancer cells, while the second reference compound NSC67078 was found to potently inhibit not only the CBS-induced AzMC fluorescence response, but also the H2S donor GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence, suggesting that at least part of the inhibition of the CBS-induced signal is unrelated to direct inhibition of the catalytic activity of CBS. Nevertheless, NSC67078 was found to be a potent inhibitor of HCT116 cell proliferation in vitro.",

Tannic acid is used in certain food industries, and albumin tannate was used in the 60\u2032s and 70\u2032s as an antidiarrheal agent [47], [48], [49]. Thorson and colleagues have previously identified another polyphenol, rutin, as a CBS inhibitor [26]; to our knowledge this is the first report to identify tannic acid as a CBS inhibitor. Although the polyphenolic nature of tannic acid suggested non-specific (e.g. potential H2S scavenging) properties of various polyphenols, tannic acid did not interfere with the AzMc responses induced by the H2S donor compound GYY4137. Interestingly, tannins have been reported to inhibit bacterial H2S production [50], an effect that we hypothesize may be related to its inhibitory effect of bacterial H2S-producing enzymes. Tannic acid exerted a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on HCT116 cell proliferation, with an IC50 of 20 \u03bcM. Multiple lines of studies have previously identified the anticancer effects of tannins, although the exact mechanism(s) have not been clearly elucidated; they range from direct cytotoxity to inhibition of various putative target enzymes including proteasomes [51], [52], [53], [54], [55]. Based on the current studies, we hypothesize that inhibition of tumor CBS activity may contribute to the anticancer effects of tannins.",

Although its mode of action and its diverse pharmacological effects suggest lack of specificity (and perhaps lack of in vivo utility) surprisingly, aurintricarboxylic acid is tolerated in experimental animals, and, in fact, has been shown to produce therapeutic benefits in a variety of conditions including encephalitis and sepsis [62], [63].",

            "text": "Finally, our screen and our follow-up work identified benserazide ((RS)-2-Amino-3-hydroxy-N-(2,3,4-trihydroxybenzyl)propanehydrazide) as a CBS inhibitor with an IC50 of \u223c30 \u03bcM. Thorson and colleagues have previously reported [26] the CBS inhibitory effect of benserazide, albeit with a lower potency (125 \u03bcM). We hypothesize that the difference may be related to the aqueous instability (oxidation-prone nature) of this compound \u2013 as demonstrated in our current study as well as reported previously [35], [36]. Benserazide produced the expected features of a CBS inhibitor; similar to AOAA (as shown previously in [11], [67]), benserazide inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation, and suppressed cancer cell bioenergetic responses. Our computer-based modeling studies have identified a predicted mode of its inhibitory action. It should be noted, nevertheless, that the extent to which benserazide suppresses the proliferation of colon cancer cells depended on the cell type studied. A significant suppression of proliferation (and, at the highest concentrations tested, some degree of cytotoxicity, as evidenced by increased LDH release) was noted in HCT116 cells (Fig. 9) and HT-29 cells (Fig. 15) that express a relatively high concentration of CBS. By comparison, in LoVo cells, which express a lower level of CBS, neither benserazide-induced antiproliferative effects, nor benserazide-induced increases in LDH release were seen (Fig. 16). These data support the conclusion that benserazide is targeting CBS. However, we are well aware of the fact that there are many other possibilities that may explain the differential effects, including potential differences in cell uptake, or potential differences in the cellular metabolism of benserazide.",

The original mode of benserazide's mode of action is to inhibit the peripheral DOPA decarboxylase (which, similar to CBS, is a PLP-dependent enzyme) [68], [69]. A detailed review of the published pharmacological and toxicological literature from the 70\u2032s [70], [71] \u2013 mainly generated by pharmacologists at Hoffman LaRoche, the original producer of Madopar\u00ae Roche (1 component benserazide + 4 component L-DOPA) \u2013 reveals that benserazide has >35% oral bioavailability in rats and \u223c70% oral bioavailability in humans. At 1\u20134 h after oral administration of a single dose of 50 mg radiolabeled benserazide, human plasma concentrations were established in the range of 0.5\u20131 \u03bcg/ml (i.e. 2\u20134 \u03bcM). In rats, a single dose of 10 mg radiolabeled benserazide produced plasma levels of 1\u201310 \u03bcg/ml (i.e. 4\u201340 \u03bcM) [70], [71]. Similar to many examples in the literature, the plasma concentrations of drugs targeting intracellular enzymes (especially when the mode of action is irreversible binding to the enzyme, as is the case for benserazide, which binds to the PLP prosthetic group of its targets) do not necessarily predict tissue levels or the degree of inhibition of its intracellular target. Importantly, in rat studies [70], [71], benserazide concentrations in the kidney and the liver were 2\u20133-fold higher than plasma concentrations at 1\u201312 h after single dose administration. In addition to benserazide itself, our data indicate that its major metabolite 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzylhydrazine (THBH) also acts as a CBS inhibitor and colon cancer cell antiproliferative agent (Fig. 12). Based on the above pharmacokinetic considerations, we predict that tumor tissue concentrations comparable to the antiproliferative concentrations of benserazide (as well as its metabolite) may be achievable in vivo, which may open the potential for therapeutic repurposing of the compound.",

            "text": "One way to predict target engagement is to survey the literature for biochemical alterations (potential biomarkers) after benserazide administration that may suggest CBS inhibition. We found no published studies in the literature on the effect of benserazide on H2S production or H2S levels. Therefore, we focused on secondary biomarkers. Since liver CBS plays a physiological role in plasma homocysteine metabolism [15], we predicted that CBS target engagement by benserazide in humans may induce hyperhomocysteinemia. Indeed, a recent study shows that benserazide in Parkinson's patients produces a \u223c15% increase in plasma homocysteine levels [72], which we interpret as the inactivation of CBS by benserazide, followed by the accumulation of its substrate, homocysteine in the circulation. Further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies are needed to determine the feasibility of benserazide as a potentially repurposable agent for the experimental therapy of cancer.",

Future work is needed to determine whether the ability of copper to inhibit CBS may be useful in the context of therapeutic CBS inhibition.",

Nevertheless, NSC67078 was found to be the most potent inhibitor of HCT116 cell proliferation amongst all the molecules evaluated in the current project. Given the fact, however, that this compound is known as a highly potent inhibitor of the \u03b2-catenin pathway [75], [76], as well as a SIRT1/2 inhibitor [77], we hypothesize that \u03b2-catenin inhibition and SIRT inhibition significantly contributes to its potent inhibitory effect on cancer cell proliferation in vitro; further work is needed to dissect the various possible mechanisms (\u03b2-catenin inhibition, SIRT inhibition, CBS inhibition, perhaps other actions as well) in its anti-proliferative actions.",
