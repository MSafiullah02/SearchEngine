Amongst these proteins, the S protein is biologically very important because it could be involved in determination of viral tropism. Indeed, it could for instance be associated with the capacity of the virus to reach the central nervous system (CNS) and possibly trigger neurological disorders. It could also confer the host species specificity observed with coronaviruses. In past years, we have shown that HCoV-OC43 is neurotropic and neuroinvasive, as it persistently infects neural cell cultures 1 and human brains. 2 Although we have suggested that OC43 could remain genetically surprisingly stable in the environment, 3 it is known that coronaviruses can adapt in cell culture or under selection pressure, for instance related to immune system evasion.",

The HE protein gene and the nucleocapsid protein gene N were also sequenced in order to determine if these genes contributed to adaptation in cell culture. Viral particles released from persistently infected neural cell lines were isolated and purified by gradient centrifugation, and genomic RNA was sequenced. Results showed various mutations in the S gene but very few in HE and N genes, suggesting that the S gene is responsible for adaptation to the cellular environment, which could be associated with neurotropism, neuroinvasion, and presumably neuropathogenesis ( Table 1) . Almost every acquired mutation (Table 1 ) was conserved at subsequent passages, suggesting that they could confer an adaptive advantage and a stable phenotype to the virus. Five mutations were predominant and were found in almost all persistent infections (D24Y, S83T, H183R, Y241H, and N489H). The first four mutations are hypervariable region.",
