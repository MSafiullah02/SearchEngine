Common presenting clinical symptoms are fever and cough in addition to other unspecific symptoms including, fatigue, dyspnea, muscle soreness and headache [3]. Intriguingly, a small percentage (5%) case is asymptomatic (i.e., with normal body temperature or minor discomfort) [4, 5], while reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from swab samples has demonstrated high specificity but relatively low sensitivity (60\u201370%) [6, 7]. Moreover, when comparing RT-PCR to chest CT, the latter demonstrated a better sensitivity in particular in early stages [6, 7]. Therefore, the RT-PCR from swab samples is still the standard of reference in the diagnosis of COVID-19, while unenhanced, high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) has a central role in detection, diagnosis and follow-up of the disease [8\u201310].",

            "text": "CT is a widely available technique allowing for high-quality and standardized evaluation of the lung parenchyma. However, radiation exposure and motion artifacts are major issues in uncooperative, young patients undergoing to repeated CT examinations [11]. To reduce motion artifacts in uncooperative patients (e.g., pediatric patients or patients with dyspnea), fast acquisitions are obtained by lowering the rotation time of the tube-detector system with high pitch and wide collimation values [12]. Conversely, lower radiation doses are achieved at low kV with the implementation of iterative reconstructions for noise reduction [13]. The dual-source CT scanners (DSCT, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) are equipped with two asymmetrical tube-detector systems (i.e., different scan Field of View, FOV), mounted in the gantry with an offset of ~ 90\u00b0. The two tube-detector systems work at different kVp settings for dual-energy acquisitions or at the same kVp setting for ultrafast acquisitions at long pitch (Pitch 1.5\u20133, Flash or Turbo Flash mode, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen) [14, 15]. Moreover, the X-ray tubes in the second- and third-generation scanners (respectively, the Somatom Flash and Force, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen) have additional tin filtration [16, 17]. In particular, the more aggressive tin filtration in the Somatom Force provides the best spectral separation in dual-energy (DECT) acquisitions by increasing the mean energy of high-kVp spectrum (i.e., 150Sn kVp) [17]. Moreover, the spectral shaping with tin filter (i.e., 100Sn kVp) allows for reduction in the low-energy component of the X-ray spectrum, leading to significant dose reduction [18, 19]. Coupling an ultra-low-dose, fast, long-pitch dual-source acquisition with spectral shaping may be of relevant value in serial evaluations in dyspneic or coughing patients with COVID-19.",

However, these differences had poor significance in the evaluation of lung SNR and CNR, in agreement to the subjective analysis. Again, this can be explained by considering the relatively high mean energy of the 100Sn kVp spectrum contributing to lowering the noise together with the radiation dose (Table 2, Fig. 2) [19]. Moreover, in this protocol, the reconstructions have been kept as similar as possible, in particular the slice thickness, the slice spacing and the iterative reconstructions while for LDCT a slightly softer kernel was used. Again, in Table 4, the image sharpness of LDCT was comparable with maintained diagnostic reliability. Further studies are necessary to fully explore the role of iterative reconstructions at lower doses in this acute setting [18].",
