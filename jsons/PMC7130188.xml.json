In addition to our regular issues of general content we have commissioned a number of special issues that focus on issues of global importance. The world's cultures, economics, politics and patterns of health and disease have changed markedly since publication of the first edition of the IJNS and yet a review of the most highly cited papers over the past five decades reveals a consistent set of issues which have received the attention of successive generations of researchers.",

            "text": "Preparation of nurses for clinical practice has been a focus of many papers. Indeed the first ever paper published in the IJNS was by Patricia O\u2019Connell (1963) a Health Visitor Tutor based at the University of Southampton, UK who made the case for the educated nurse and the merits of university based nurse education. It was not until almost 30 years later, following the Project 2000 (1986) initiative, that university based education became the norm for British nurses with the minimum qualification set at Diploma (associate degree) level. A university degree as the minimum qualification for British nurses will be introduced in 2013 \u2013 a fact which colleagues based outside the UK often find astounding, a whole 50 years following publication of O\u2019Connell's paper. The progress towards graduate entry nurses in the UK contrasts sharply with bold steps by some other European countries, Australia, China and elsewhere to drive forward the development of professional nursing and midwifery through education.",

            "text": "In the intervening decades the IJNS has been active in building the case for educated nurses who can apply best evidence to their practice (Griffiths, 2008). Two highly cited studies, one in the UK (Bryar et al., 2003) and one in Australia (Retsas and Nolan, 1999), investigated the barriers faced by nurses applying research in their practice. Both studies called for fundamental changes within the education system to improve the teaching of critical appraisal and research skills and changes to the organisation of nursing work to provide nurses with the time and support needed to apply research findings to practice. It is disappointing to note that a recent Swedish study shows that nursing students still have only a \u2018modest\u2019 intention to use research evidence in practice (Forsman et al., 2012). What good is published research if the findings are not implemented for the benefit of patients? As part of our 50th Anniversary celebrations we will publish a Special Issue on Implementation Science guest edited by Theo van Achterberg (Radboud University Nijmegen) and Anne Sales (VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, USA), which will inform the systematic uptake of clinical research findings and other evidence-based practices into routine practice.",

A second IJNS Special Issue, released as part of our 50th Anniversary celebrations, guest edited by Linda Aiken (University of Pennsylvania, USA) and Koen Van den Heede (Belgian Healthcare Knowledge Centre), brings together findings from a major EU funded nursing workforce study (RN4Cast), which seeks to establish how hospital nurse staffing, skill mix, educational composition, and quality of the nurse work environment impact hospital mortality, failure to rescue, quality of care, and patient satisfaction.",

            "text": "Trends in child, maternal and adult death rates have changed the pattern of disease and the nature of the work of professional nurses and midwives. Child death rates tumbled by around 45% between 1970 and 2002 and a further 52% between 1970 and 2010 but this trend is patchy; today 33% of deaths of children <5 years of age now occur in southwest Asia and 50% in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in west Africa (De Cock, 2011). At the start of the 21st Century three health related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs 4, 5 and 6) were identified relating to child health, maternal health and HIV, TB and malaria. MDG 5 calls for a 75% reduction in global maternity mortality ratio from 1990 to 2015, and universal access to services such as family planning. On current estimates neither of these objectives are likely to be achieved within the timescale. As part of the IJNS 50th Anniversary celebrations we recognise the crucial importance of child health through publication of an IJNS Child Health Special Issue guest edited by Linda Franck (University of California, San Francisco, USA) and Sanna Salanter\u00e4 (University of Turku, Finland).",

Older people are our future, quite literally, but the capabilities required to provide high quality nursing for this patient group is too often underestimated. Recent papers published in the IJNS to inform older people's nursing include those on hydration of older people (Godfrey et al., 2012), pain assessment and management (Manias, 2012) and a study of student nurses\u2019 career preferences for working in this specialty (Stevens, 2011).

While many of the most highly cited papers published in the IJNS in previous decades were clinical research papers, they were often based on relatively small scale studies, sometimes carried out by individuals as a requirement for a university degree. Fifty years later nursing and midwifery continues to suffer from far too few research programmes which build on research findings incrementally. Nevertheless, there are some clinical topics covered by papers in the IJNS which taken together resemble the outcomes of a research programme.",

            "text": "One such topic is pressure ulcer prevention, which is a major focus of nursing care in many settings and has emerged in recent years as a potentially sensitive outcome measure of the quality of nursing care. Almost 40 years ago Gerson's (1975) study established the incidence of pressure ulcers in a sample of 5648 patients in three Canadian hospitals and found that older patients, long stay patients and those with neoplastic disease, diseases of the circulatory system and those who had accidents were over-represented in the pressure ulcer group. More recent studies have investigated the causes of pressure ulcers; for example the relationship between friction and pressure and pressure ulcers (Lahmann and Kottner, 2011), the relationship between weight and pressure ulcers (Kottner et al., 2011) and factors related to the development of pressure ulcers in recipients of home care services (Tsai et al., 2011). Other studies have investigated how pressure sores can be prevented; for example, Defloor et al.\u2019s (2005) study of the impact of turning and pressure relieving devices in reducing the incidence of pressure ulcers (see also Beeckman et al., 2011), Beeckman et al.\u2019s (2012) evaluation of the impact of an electronic clinical decision support system on pressure ulcer prevention and several studies of the contribution of pressure relieving support services (McInnes et al., 2012a, McInnes et al., 2012b, Demarr\u00e9 et al., 2012). And we have also published studies which have investigated how pressure ulcers can be measured and assessed; for example, Kottner et al.\u2019s (2012) systematic review of paediatric pressure ulcer risk assessment scales. But such examples are, in truth, few and far between. We hope to see more of their like in the future.",
