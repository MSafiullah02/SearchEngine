The NHC later confirmed that the infection was a novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP). On February 12, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was given a formal name, COVID-19. On January 20, 2020, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Korea.1 After the first COVID-19 case was confirmed on January 20, 2020, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has focused on delaying the inflow of the virus into Korea and its spread in local communities, with considerable success. Also, the mortality rate of COVID-19 outside China was rather low, leading to the expectation that the disease\u2019s impact on national health would be minor. However, things turned over rapidly after Case No. 31. The epidemic is spreading rapidly on a global level.2 The Secretary General of World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that the COVID-19 epidemic has reached its watershed and that every state should prepare for it.3\n",
