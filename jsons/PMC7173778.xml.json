Many countries had extremely negative checking account balances, while others achieved atypical surplus values, which led to a global financial crisis. Some countries had loose monetary policies, and at the same time, a great amount of savings. This led to the inflation of assets\u2019 prices, especially real state, which came to be known as the real estate bubble (Garc\u00eda 2005).",

The instability in the construction industry led to high rates of indebtedness, which soon affected the country\u2019s whole economy. An excessive amount of money was being loaned to an industry that was no longer profitable. In this context, banks were increasingly uncertain about whether the debts would be liquidated. Moreover, productivity problems tend to lead to future economic issues. In the years preceding the crisis, Spain\u2019s GDP grew more than that of the United Kingdom and the United States (EU-KLEM 2013). This was already a sign that something was not right, or that, at the very least, the situation was temporary and unrealistic. A significant part of this growth was caused by the construction industry, which was responsible for 25% of the country\u2019s economic growth between 2000 and 2007. As Garc\u00eda (2005) points out, this was caused by the increase in working hours and the intensive use of technological capital.",

Naturally, the health crisis currently being faced by the whole world due to the outbreak of COVID-19 is an even bigger problem, which is expected to have catastrophic consequences for many countries\u2019 economies, including Spain. In this context, it is important to observe that the present research does not consider such phenomenon, which started after the data collection and analysis period. Regarding the methodological steps carried out as part of this investigation, first the extant literature on the Spanish financial crisis was systematically reviewed, which allowed the authors to understand the factors that led to this situation. Then, to achieve this paper\u2019s objective, the interest of the general population was assessed through the analysis of Google searches on the subject throughout the selected timeframe (2007\u20132019). Meanwhile, the interest of academics was examined through the analysis of scientific papers published on the Scopus database during the same period.",

Immigration, low interest rates, and a recently liberalised and modernised economy had contributed to this great economic status (Royo 2009). This condition, however, was interrupted in 2007, when the country started facing a severe economic recession. Although the global economic crisis significantly contributed to this deceleration, domestic imbalances have also played an important role. In this context, 2007 is arguably the year when the financial crisis reached Spain, along with many other European countries.",

In other words, during this time, it was particularly easy to convert any financial asset into money with minimal loss. This is shown by the increase in monetary aggregates (Adrian and Shin 2008) noticed in this period, which led to an overcapacity of the financial system. This, in turn, led to a general state of distrust, in which neither employers nor families were willing to not take credit. The only cases in which credit was taken were those when people needed to renew their debts or cover their losses. Naturally, as capitalist economies are based on credit, such situation would necessarily have a negative impact on the country\u2019s economy.",

However, the key factor that led Spain to the current crisis was the channelling of the financial sector into the real estate market (Alvarez 2008; Montalvo 2014; Taylor 2009). The so-called system of perverse incentives, adopted as a temporary solution to fund construction activities, made the real estate market very attractive (Montalvo 2014). For the families, buying a house started to look like a very attractive proposal.",

Moreover, if the prices happened to increase, which was expected, all parts would benefit from capital gains (Case et al. 2012). On the other hand, if prices remained stable, one could simply stop paying the mortgage and lose the purchase option. In this case, the deal would effectively become a regular rent. Another incentive was the barriers of entries, through which people could also request a loan (Mayer et al. 2009).",

In such a deal, if one does not liquidate the debt, they must give back the house. Nevertheless, the general belief was that there was an incredibly low chance of decrease in prices, which encouraged many families to buy houses anyway (Garc\u00eda-Montalvo 2006). There was a whole chain of factors that encouraged this model of purchase. For example, bank workers needed to sell mortgages in order to hit sales targets and gain bonuses. Therefore, they lowered the criteria for granting this type of loan (Montalvo 2014). Moreover, all this housing construction and urbanisation methods did not take place in an institutional void (Garc\u00eda 2010). Part of the problem was exactly the lack of spatial planning. More precisely, as observed by Maldonado and P\u00e9rez (2008), specific plans for urban development either did not exist or were totally disregarded.",

Qualitative content analysis is a method for analyzing text data and delve into their meaning by following systematic procedures (Schreier 2012). The term includes a series of different techniques to analyse texts (Powers et al. 2010). More specifically, content analysis serves to \u201cidentify, analyse and inform patterns within the data\u201d (Braun and Clarke 2006 p. 79). It includes the codification and classification of textual units, which makes it very useful to explore big volumes of textual information and determine tendencies, patterns within the words employed, as well as relationships between their meanings (Gbrich 2007). Qualitative analysis methods are not only a useful tool for generating knowledge, but also an effective vehicle for presenting and addressing meanings and findings (Holloway and Todres 2005; Sandelowski 2010). To assure these methods\u2019 validities, researchers must clearly explain how the results were achieved (Schreier 2012). In the case of content analysis, the preparation phase starts with the definition of the unit of analysis (Guthrie et al. 2004), to which researches must consider what they want to analyse (Cavanagh 1997).",

Naturally, the goal of the present study was not verifying any previously proposed hypothesis about the interest of academics in the Spanish financial crisis, but simply exploring the trends and patterns in such interest through the analysis of published researches. Therefore, within this investigation, the content analysis serves the heuristic function, as it enriches the exploratory attempt, increasing the likeliness of discovery. Moreover, within the available content analysis techniques, the one adopted in the present study was the categorical content analysis, which consists in dismembering text units, or categories, according to pre-established criteria. In this context, the chosen registry of unit was the word\u2014rather than the theme\u2014which facilitated the systematic analysis of a big volume of texts. Moreover, the main enumeration rule for coding, as it considers that the registry unit\u2019s relevance increases with its frequency of appearance.

In the years preceding the beginning of the crisis, the country experienced several favourable economic circumstances, such as a higher GDP growth than that of global leaders, i.e., the United States, which eventually proved to be an illusion. In 2007, the economic boom came to an end, following the solvency crisis in the banking system and the decrease in the demand for products and services, especially houses. In this context, the construction industry was one of the most affected, and arguably one of the main factors responsible for amplifying the crisis effects in the country (due to the real estate bubble).",

The peak in number of published papers takes place in 2017 (114 works). However, the biggest growth is noticed between 2011 and 2013, when the number of studies practically doubled. In sum, academic studies show a continuous growth from 2011 to 2017. The most frequently addressed topics amongst the 632 analysed studies are the economic or financial crisis, the economic recession, unemployment, and the banking system. Many studies share some of the same keywords, from which \u201cSpain\u201d is by far the most frequent.",

Other particularly affected area was the public sector, which was also one of the leading figures of the situation, due to the lack of a proactive attitude and preventive measures, and to its actions during the actual crisis. Other authors focus on tourism, a key industry to the Spanish economy, and one that was also affected by the crisis.",
