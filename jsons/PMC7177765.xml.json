The WHO warned in February 2020 that the COVID-19 outbreak had been accompanied by a massive \u2018infodemic\u2019, or an overabundance of information\u2014some of which was accurate and some of which was not\u2014which made it difficult for people to find reliable sources and trustworthy information when they needed it [3]. The consequences of disinformation overload are the spread of uncertainty, fear, anxiety and racism on a scale not seen in previous epidemics, such as SARS, MERS and Zika. Therefore, the WHO is dedicating tremendous efforts aimed at providing evidence-based information and advice to the population through its social media channels, such as Weibo, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Pinterest, as well as through its website. The MIT Technology Review highlights that social media are not only being used to spread false news and hate messages but are also being used to share important truthful data and solidarity with all those affected by the virus and hate messages [4].",

On the one hand, the combination of artificial intelligence and big data can help public health providers identify pandemic diseases in real time, improving the coordination of the response of public health systems through information sharing and improving surveillance and diagnostics. Furthermore, research shows that social media information and social media responses are effective strategies to gain feedback on potential public health policy proposals. This positive impact of social media in health has been demonstrated in a recent study about heat protection policy for Australian schools, which, through the analysis of public comments posted on a national Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) website, identifies the themes to support a national heat protection policy for schools [8].",

The most extensively studied topics involving misinformation in health are vaccination, Ebola and the Zika virus, as well as nutrition, cancer, the fluoridation of water and smoking [5,10,11,12]. Disinformation spread by the anti-vaccine movement has led to episodes regarding vaccination provoking easily preventable disasters, such as the measles epidemic in Washington state (January 2019). The spread of false information also explains a decrease in immunization behaviors with respect to measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccinations, explaining the drop in the demand for this vaccine in the UK and the USA between 1999 and 2000 [13].",

Globalization also plays a crucial role in the spread of health news, including social media, influencing the way users receive such news [16,17]. In this arena, it is important to highlight that in a globalized world, health content information can be perceived differently depending on the target group or context [18]. Therefore, fake news may reach citizens in different ways, depending on their age, culture, and other factors [19]. Moreover, research shows that social media and related global digital media content influence discourses about professions and how citizens perceive them, including public health professionals [20]. For instance, many public health programs aimed at children and youth have physical education at the core of their initiatives [21,22]. The teaching profession is often portrayed in digital media in relation to unhelpful physical crisis messages [23] or discourses related to bullying in movie scenes. In a similar vein, social media has also been demonstrated to influence the perceptions of adolescent students with regard to their sexual and reproductive health learning [24]. As a result, health professionals may recognize that social media channels, such as Facebook, offer possibilities to support their activities.",

For example, young people build their identities, construct knowledge and acquire information from digital media, including social media, beyond formal education and classroom learning, which is an approach resonating with \u201cpublic pedagogies\u201d [25]. Other authors such as Ulmer [26] argue that mass digital media provides the public an \u2018entry point\u2019 into the debates. The fact is that digital and social media contribute to the strength or undermine the diversity of points of view, influencing the development of specific health public health policies and interventions [27,28]. Such influence of the media has been defined by some authors as the \u201cfourth state\u201d [29].

Furthermore, in these cases, they are less likely to have a pre-existing opinion about health information than are those who share fake news stories about other topics [34]. A similar conclusion came from a fact-checking study of Twitter and Sina Weibo (the most-used social media platform in China), developed 24 hours after the WHO\u2019s declaration of the Ebola outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in August 2014.",

The second profile, called \u2018sophisticated bots\u2019, is artificial intelligence that automatically spreads content via Twitter with the same objective of making people believe that the medical community is divided. The third group of profiles is comprised of content polluters, who use anti-vaccine messages to pique users\u2019 curiosity and lead them to click on links, such that every click leads to more income for those behind the website.

These techniques include both human intervention and algorithms to verify the veracity of information across technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) [44]. Other mechanisms developed as a remedy against fake news on social media are source ratings that can be applied to articles when they are initially published, such as expert ratings (in which expert reviewers fact check articles\u2014the results of which are aggregated to provide a source rating), user article ratings (in which users rate articles\u2014the results of which are aggregated to provide a source rating), and user source ratings (in which users rate the sources themselves) [34].",

Jenner even freely treated poor people to save them from smallpox. His discovery had a substantial social impact, and his sons died due to tuberculosis, not due to smallpox vaccines.

Two main recommendations are suggested for public health professionals, among others. On the one hand, we narrow the dissemination strategies to reverse and deactivate fake news regarding health, considering that the percentage of misinformation on fake news is much higher than that observed for Twitter #vaccines. On the other hand, the design of concrete interventions for discussion forums in which health information is discussed (not only shared) can provide health information with evidence of social impact.",

The possibilities of social media analysis have been widely explored in very diverse fields, from gender to digital protests [55,56], and this work contributes to advancing knowledge in social media analysis and fake news in public health. Future investigations can use SISM to analyze the interactions in social media regarding other public health issues to further explore how citizens use and share information.",
