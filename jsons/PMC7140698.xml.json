Infection with the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus generated changes in the total DNA methylation in the thymus of infected chickens [1] and in the methylation of several inflammatory genes in human lung epithelial A549 cells [2,3]. Changes in the histone methylation status of several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in human respiratory cells infected with an H1N1 strain were also reported [4]. Performing an unbiased screening of epigenetic changes in A549 influenza H1N1 virus-infected cells, we observed unaltered DNA methylation and a general decrease in histone acetylation, which correlates with the cell host transcriptional inactivation that takes place during infection.",

The methylation of H3K79 is carried out by the histone methylase Dot1L, which exclusively methylates this lysine, and its methylation is increased in actively transcribing genes [6,7]. The inhibition of Dot1l by pinometostat (EPZ) treatment or by Dot1L silencing, stimulated influenza and vesicular stomatitis virus replication [5]. Further characterization showed decreased nuclear translocation of the NF-kB complex, as well as IFN-\u03b2, Mx1 and ISG56 expression in EPZ-treated cells [5] indicating a decreased antiviral type I IFN response, and as a consequence, a stimulation in viral replication. Conversely, Dot1L overexpression reduced the multiplication of the virus [8].",

Among the cytoplasmic RNA sensors, RIG-I plays a pivotal role in the recognition of negative-strand RNA viruses [9,10]. The melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), has been involved in the recognition of the RNA of picornaviruses [11]. However, some viruses appear to be sensed by both RIG-I and MDA5 [12]. After RNA binding, RIG-I and MDA5 undergo conformational changes that release the tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (2CARDs). After the recruitment of different phosphatases, the phosphorylation marks of the 2CARDs domains are removed [13].",

To explore their contribution, cotransfection experiments of pIF-LucTer together with plasmids expressing components of the two pathways were performed. The coexpression of pIF-LukTer with a plasmid expressing MDA5 (pEF-BOS MDA5) stimulated luciferase activity but this activation was not significantly modified in EPZ treated-cells (Figure S1), suggesting that MDA5 does not play a pivotal role in the Dot1L-mediated regulation of the IFN pathway. As a control, we cotransfected pIF-LukTer with a plasmid that expresses a constitutively active mutant form of the IRF3 protein where key Ser/Thr residues have been substituted by five phosphomimetic aspartic residues (pCAGGS-hIRF3 5D) causing IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation independently of any stimuli [19]. The EPZ treatment did not modify the luciferase activity levels upon IRF3 mutant coexpression (Figure S1) suggesting that signaling events upstream of IRF3 activation are modulated by EPZ.",

In addition, the aforementioned data suggested a role for NS1 in Dot1L regulation of the innate response against influenza infection. Thus, we asked whether NS1 was also required for EPZ-mediated inhibition of NF-\u03baB translocation in response to viral infection. To this end, control or Dot1L-inhibited A549 cells were infected at MOI 3 with PR8 or delNS1 viruses, fixed at the peak of NP antigen expression (8 and 16 hpi, respectively) and the subcellular NF-\u03baB localization was determined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 5B\u2013D). The quantitation of the relative p65 intensity in the nucleus and cytoplasm is shown in Figure 5E. In non-infected cells (MOCK), NF-\u03baB localization was entirely cytoplasmic and it was not affected by EPZ treatment (Figure 5B). The infection with PR8 and delNS1 provoked NF-\u03baB nuclearization (Figure 5C\u2013E) and, in agreement with our previous studies, the NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation was inhibited by EPZ in the PR8 infected cells (Figure 5C,F). Dot1L inhibition did not significantly reduce NF-\u03baB relocalization in delNS1 infection (Figure 5D,E). These data reinforce the notion that NS1 is an important determinant of the antiviral response when Do1L activity is inhibited.",

Subsequent studies using a chemical inhibitor of Dot1L or specific Dot1L silencers, showed that the downregulation of Dot1L increased influenza virus replication through a decrease of the IFN-\u03b2 signaling pathway [5]. Conversely, upregulation of Dot1L reduced influenza virus replication [8]. The augmented H3K79 methylation triggered by the influenza virus may increase the IFN-\u03b2 pathway stimulation and the antiviral response and would represent a host cell defense response to the infection.",

            "text": "The RNA analysis of genes involved in the interferon signaling pathway indicated that influenza virus infection stimulates TRIM25 expression, which in turn markedly decreases when infected human alveolar epithelial cells are treated with a Dot1L inhibitor (Table 1, Figure 6). Characterization of the immune response induced by different pathogens in murine alveolar macrophages infected at high MOI [40], showed a higher induction of TRIM25 expression in delNS1 infected cells compared with PR8 infection (data not shown). TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination stimulates RIG-I tetramerization, allowing RIG-I-MAVS interaction, which triggers the induction of the innate immune response [45,46,47]. The influenza virus expresses the NS1 protein, a multifunctional protein capable of counteracting the antiviral response [37]. The interaction of NS1 with RIG-I has been reported [48]. In addition, NS1 interacts with TRIM25 impairing the formation of the RIG-I-MAVS complexes [35]. The C-terminal domain of NS1 appears to be involved in NS1-TRIM25 interaction as C-terminal mutants do not bind TRIM25 and do not block RIG-I ubiquitination mediated by TRIM25 [49,50,51]. In contrast to PR8 infection, viral replication (Figure 4A), the activation of IFN-\u03b2-driven expression (Figure 4B), RIG-I-MAVS association (Figure 5A), and NF-kB nuclearization (Figure 5D,E) are not affected by Dot1L inhibition in delNS1 infection. These data agree with the described role of the NS1 protein that would interact with TRIM25, competing with the TRIM25-RIG-I association and decreasing the antiviral response (Figure 9A). In the infected and Dot1L-inhibited cells, decreased levels of TRIM25 occur, which would diminish RIG-I ubiquitination, RIG-I-MAVS association, RIG-I signaling, and the antiviral response and consequently increases viral replication (Figure 9B). As described, in cells infected with the delNS1 virus, increased antiviral response occurs, partly mediated by the absence of competitor TRIM25-RIG-I associations. In this situation, decreased levels of TRIM25 by Dot1L inhibition may generate small changes in RIG-I-MAVS interaction with slight changes in the antiviral response.",

The V protein of the Sendai virus [52] also competes with TRIM25-RIG-I association. On the other hand, vesicular stomatitis virus infection downregulates NLRP12 expression, a protein that also associates with TRIM25 [53]. According to the role of TRIM25 as a check point of the innate immune induction, the decreased levels produced by Dot1L downregulation stimulate influenza and vesicular stomatitis virus replication [5] and reduce the induction of type I interferon in influenza, vesicular stomatitis, and Sendai virus infected cells (Figure 1). In addition, TRIM25 overexpression restores the stimulation of type I IFN in Dot1L inhibited-influenza virus infected cells or in cells expressing different intermediates of the RIG-I signaling pathway (Figure 7).",

Many different partners have been described to fuse to the protein complexes containing the MLL gene. Many of them are factors involved in transcriptional regulation, such as Dot1L, which is frequently found in those complexes [54,55]. The host-factors relevant for infection, such as TRIM25, seem to be a target for Dot1L modulation even in uninfected cells [8]. In agreement with that, an important number of the frequent treatment-emergent adverse events that may be related with infection were reported in Phase 1 clinical trials of MLL-r patients treated with pinometostat (EPZ) [56]. The ability of Dot1L to regulate IFN signaling, supports an important and general role of Dot1L in the control of pathogen infections. Changes in H3K79 methylation during infection may modulate the access of transcriptional complexes to the genes involved in the control of the antiviral response and, thus, changes in the chromatin structure need to be considered as additional host-mechanisms for the control of RNA viruses.",
