The deletion of either P4 or P2' residue in the substrate would decrease its cleavage efficiency dramatically. In contrast to the previous suggestion that only small residues in substrate could be accommodated to the S1' subsite, we have found that bulky residues such as Tyr and Trp were also acceptable. In addition, based on both peptide-based assay and autocleavage assay, Ile at the P1' position could not be hydrolyzed, but the mutant L27A could hydrolyze the Ile peptide fragment. It suggested that there was a stereo hindrance between the S1' subsite and the side chain of Ile in the substrate.
