As medical students, we feel that there is significant difficulty in creating an environment in which we can adequately learn content indepth under tight time constraints. As a consequence, self-directed study can be undermined, with medical students often lacking confidence in the relevance of information obtained through independent study. This has previously been observed where the preparedness of medical students from different curricula (traditional lecture based versus problem based versus integrated) was assessed. Students in heavily selfdirected learning curriculums had a significantly lower self-rating of knowledge compared to students from a traditional curriculum [3] . Therefore, we suggest that medical educators look to address and minimise ambiguity over depth and duration spent on self-learning activities as a way of increasing confidence in the knowledge gained. From our experiences in medical school, we believe there is a distinct difference between students benefiting from selfdirected learning versus feeling unsure about whether they have met the intended learning outcomes.",
