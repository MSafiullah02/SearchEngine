Symptoms at the onset of COVID-19 infection in hospitalized patients in China include fever, cough, fatigue,[4] myalgia, sputum production, dyspnea, oppression in the chest, diarrhea, headache, anorexia, chest pain, sore throat, dizziness, palpitations and vomiting.[5]\n",

A short communication from Italy reported a possible association between COVID-19 and anosmia.[7] A 2004 study from Japan evaluated 24 patients who presented over a four-year period with sudden onset of smell loss and had a normal exam of the nose. Ten of those patients were evaluated with viral analysis. Only one patient tested positive for human coronavirus 229E.[1] Of the ten patients the most common cause of post viral olfactory loss was human rhinovirus, followed by Epstein Barr virus. One patient out of the ten had anosmia and one had dysosmia. The remainder had hyposmia.[1]\n",

Due to constraints on testing availability, not all patients had COVID-19 testing, particularly as some reported no other respiratory symptoms or only mild symptoms, thus precluding them from testing. All patients described complete anosmia affecting their taste, so there was no need to do smell testing due to limitations imposed by COVID-19 pandemic.",

According to that experience from January 2001 to December 2004, a total of 24 patients presented with sudden onset of viral anosmia over a 4-year period. This presentation frequency is consistent with the frequency with which we saw acute viral olfactory disorders in our offices in the past. In contrast, our case series presents 8 patients during a two-week period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Five patients out of eight were tested for COVID-19. The other three have not been able to be tested given the limitations of testing during the pandemic. Additionally, the majority of patients had atypical histories-- they either had no symptoms or mild respiratory symptoms, and the smell loss is complete. In the previous study of acute viral olfactory change, the majority of patients had hyposmia. Only one had anosmia and the other had dysosmia.[1] In our case series all presented with anosmia and many had the sensation of loss of sense of taste. Lastly, in the previous study, only one patient in 10 had coronavirus 229E. In our case series, five out of the 8 were tested and were positive for COVID-19.",
