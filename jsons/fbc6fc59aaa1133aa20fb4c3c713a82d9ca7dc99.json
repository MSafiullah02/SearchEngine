            "text": "The new zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus not previously seen in humans and which appears to come from bat species. It originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and spread rapidly throughout the world, causing over 2,341,066 global cases and 161,324 deaths in almost every country in the world, including Europe, particularly Italy. In general, based on existing data published to date, 80.9% of patients infected with the virus develop mild infection; 13.8% severe pneumonia; 4.7% respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure; 3% of these cases are fatal. Critical patients have been shown to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hospitalization in intensive care units. The average age of patients admitted to hospital is 57-79 years, with one third half with an underlying disease. Asymptomatic infections have also been described, but their frequency is not known. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is mainly airborne from one person to another via droplets. The data available so far seem to indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of producing an excessive immune reaction in the host. The virus attacks type II pneumocytes in the lower bronchi through the binding of the Spike protein (S protein) to viral receptors, of which the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) receptor is the most important. ACE2 receptor is widely expressed in numerous tissues, including the oropharynx and conjunctiva, but mostly distributed in ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes in the lower bronchi. The arrival of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs causes severe primary interstitial viral pneumonia that can lead to the \"cytokine storm syndrome\", a deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response triggered by the activation of interleukin 6 (IL-6), whose effect is extensive lung tissue damage and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), that are life-threatening for patients with COVID-19. In the absence of a therapy of proven efficacy, current management consists of off-label or compassionate use therapies based on antivirals, antiparasitic agents in both oral and parenteral formulation, anti-inflammatory drugs, oxygen therapy and heparin support and convalescent plasma. Like most respiratory viruses can function and replicate at low temperatures (i.e. 34-35\u00b0C) and assuming viral thermolability of SARS-CoV-2, local instillation or aerosol of antiviral (i.e. remdesivir) in humid heat vaporization (40\u00b0-41\u00b0C) in the first phase of infection (phenotype I, before admission), both in asymptomatic but nasopharyngeal swab positive patients, together with antiseptic-antiviral oral gargles and povidone-iodine eye drops for conjunctiva (0,8-5% conjunctival congestion), would attack the virus directly through the receptors to which it binds, significantly decreasing viral replication, risk of evolution to phenotypes IV and V, reducing hospitalization and therefore death.",

The bronchialalveolar temperature is 37\u00b0-38\u00b0C. Air is cleaned from about 85% from particles >4.5 micron by mucous-ciliary clearance that transports germs from the nose through pharynx to the stomach for gastric destruction. The nasopharyngeal cavity is naturally exposed to the penetration of pathogenic bacteria that forcefully adhere to the walls and creep into the lymphatic folds maintaining a persistent bacterial load [1] . The Hemophilus Influenzae (HI) and the Streptococcus Pneumoniae (SP), which together with the Moraxella catarrhalis are considered the 'infernal trio'; the most frequent pathogens of the URDT (upper respiratory digestive tract) are instead present in healthy individuals only in 6% of the nasal samples and in 27% of the pharyngeal samples with a clear prevalence HI (5%) compared to SP (0.5%). In healthy subjects the anaerobic nasal culture is always characterized by the presence of Propionibacterium acnes in 74.5% and Peptococcus magnus in 3.5%. Viruses cause 85% to 95% of throat infections in adults and children younger than 5 years of age; for those aged 5 to 15 years, viruses cause about 70%/ of throat infections, with the other 30% due to bacterial infections, mostly group A \u03b2-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) [2] . NK cells are there largely active.",

Ocular surface cooled during sustained eye opening and rate of the cooling was greater in the dry eye patient (mostly older people and video terminal operator) [6] , while it increases to 36\u00b0-37\u00b0C at the conjunctival fornix . In the logical context of this paper, this would justify the related conjunctivitis SARS-CoV-2/19. Indeed, pharyngodinia and lowtemperature related conjunctivitis is a common finding in respiratory virus infections. A report in The Lancet, raised concern that ocular surfaces may be a potential target for human-SARS-CoV-2 invasion via droplets, as published by Sun and Coll [7a,b] in two consecutive papers collected in two different period: in Huazhong province from the end of December 2019 till February 7 th 2020, and in Hubei province in the second week of February 2020, that had similar results. Twelve (32%) patients in the first series had conjunctivitis with signs that included conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, and increased secretions. Of those patients, 11 (92%) tested positive for CoV-19 by nasopharyngeal swab. In one patient, epiphora was the first symptom of COVID-19. Twentyeight (74%) of the 38 patients in the second one was positive for CoV-19 by nasopharyngeal swabs, of whom only two (5%) patients had a positive conjunctival specimen, whilst Guan and Coll locally positive patients of those affected by conjunctivitis in evolved stages [9] (the virus possibly vanished in the meantime or by therapy). Still remaining unknown the percentage in phenotype I and in asymptomatic pre-clinical (the majority!) patients. Aged patients have higher rate of dry eye that could justify or amplify the virus conjunctival access to the body, reaching the nose via the lacrimal ductus. Environmental control should therefore take into consideration topical humidification preferably with a cross-linked hyaluronate drops and a hot vaporization (suffumigation, water hot-humid vaporization (WHV) [10] ) involving also the upper airways in mucosal continuity with the conjunctiva (FIG.2) . It must be humid: an air dryer evaporates the tear film, drastically reduces lactoferrin, mucin trap-door effectiveness and macrophages activity; in addition to the peptidoglycan N-acetylmuramoyl hydrolase (i.e. Fleming's Lysozyme) whose catalysis rate is maximum at pH5.",

This also causes vasoconstriction reducing blood flow and mucin production. Increasing the air temperature, therefore keeping the upper tract and trachea-bronchial temperature higher, may reduce the replication and diffusion of the respiratory virus. Older people have a weak and altered thermoregulatory response while children, that quickly develop a high body temperature that may halt viral replication, and more balanced immune response, /may have a better chance of fighting infections. SARS-CoV-2 binding the Toll Like Receptor (TLR) causes the release of pro-IL-1\u03b2 which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature IL-1\u03b2which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis [11] , cardiovascular implications [12] [13] for increased troponin T (TnT), C-reactive protein and terminal fragment of type B natriuretic pro-peptide (NT-proBNP ), microvascular endothelial aggression and intestinal-pulmonary cross-talk, with link to colangiocyte ACE2 receptor, interfering with intestinal microbiota [14] requiring pro-biotic adjuvant therapy. This infectious disease mostly affects men, since immune genes are more expressed on the X chromosome [11] . The two coronaviruses that preceded CoV-19 causing respectively the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) pandemic of 2003 [15] and the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic of 2012 [16] , emerged during the summer and spring-summer season, thus not respecting the principle that \"respiratory viruses can only function (and replicate) at lower temperatures (i.e. 34-35\u00b0C)\", as stated [10] . The MERS, moreover, is still ongoing in endemic form since 2012, therefore disrespectful of the summer-winter binomial. These concepts, are perhaps explainable that both viruses have made the so-called species jump (Spillover), thus modifying the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of both virus. SARS-CoV-2 probably behaves in the same way. Therefore, it cannot be accurately stated that this is thermolabile. The biological characteristics of the latter coronavirus are not yet known; SARS-CoV-2 also made the spillover, but passing directly from the bat to the man maybe without an intermediate host [17] .",

Coronaviruses contain positive-strand RNA, with the largest RNA genome (approximately 30 kb) reported to date. The genome RNA is complexed with the basic nucleocapsid (N) protein to form a helical capsid found within the viral membrane. The membranes of all coronaviruses contain at least three viral proteins, of which the most important is the spike (S), the type I glycoprotein that forms the peplomers on the virion surface, giving the virus its corona-or crown-like morphology in the electron microscope.",

As all viruses, SARS-CoV-2 needs an animal cell to survive and spread off. Out of this host, virus loses the ability to survive and infect. Degradation time depends on temperature, humidity and behavior and belongs to the capsid. For this reason, the foamy detergents are active for a contact of at least 20 ', the heat degrades the membrane lipids, as it happens for alcohol 65%, chloride in water 1/5 that directly destroys the protein, as for H 2 O 2 at maximal concentration. It may remain stable in cold outside behavior or in the air conditioner for more than 3 hours and on surfaces for days [18] , needing also humidity and obscurity, being destroyed by UV, hot, dried and illuminated environments. Up to now is unknown if SARS-CoV-2 induces viremia, as happens in Feline coronavirus [19] that also cause virus systemic spread, including inflammation of the abdominal and thoracic cavities and occasionally, other organs including brain [20] with confusion and epileptic crisis till neurological reliquate needing rehabilitation, as .experienced by many survivors. Anyway, even in the absence of precise data on viremia, we can with reasonable certainty state that SARS-CoV-2 runs down to the lung. The virus binds to the type II pneumocytes from lower bronchi via Spike protein (S-protein) [17] binding to virus receptors, of which the angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is the most important [21] . In the respiratory tract, ACE2 receptor is widely expressed on type II pneumocytes of the alveoli, trachea, bronchi, bronchial submucous membrane serous glands [22] , and alveolar monocytes and macrophages. The arrival of SARS-CoV-2 to the lungs causes primary severe viral interstitial pneumonia which in about 10% of cases can degenerate into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) characterized by a cytochemical storm triggered by the activation of interleukin 6 (IL-6) [11] : the Cytokine Storm Syndrome (CSS).",

In subsequent cases, the use of warmer humid air (40-41\u00b0C) in ventilation systems and artificial respirators (WHV) can kill viruses or stop their replication in the respiratory tree helping the recovery process; in fact, the correlation between lower air/environment temperatures and respiratory infections (especially acute viral infections) is one of the pillars of 'common' hygiene and medicine: most viruses die when exposed to warmer air.

It should be noted that vaporisation particles have a diameter greater than 8 microns impacting the oropharynx, while aerosol particles, therefore capable of settling at the lower airway level, are between 0,5 and 5 microns in size. So if the hypothesis is to attack the virus in the oropharynx through the binding of SARS-COV-2 with the ACE2 receptor also present in this district, vaporization would be fine (both as suffumigation); but if we have to chase it into the lung, an aerosol is mandatory. Local instillation, vaporization or aerosolization of antivirals with WHV 40\u00b0-41\u00b0C can significantly decrease viral replication in hours or 2-3 days at most, in the early stages of respiratory disease (preclinical and phenotype I Straw I [29*] , (Box 1).

Accumulating evidence suggests that SARS-COV-2 causes an inflammatory response in the lower airway and leads to lung injury. Collectively, virus particles invade the respiratory mucosa first and infect other cells, triggering a powerful immune response with production of a cytokine storm, i.e. a deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response in the body resulting from the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IL-33, TNF-\u03b1, TGF\u03b2, etc.) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, etc.) from immune-effector cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may",

The nucleotide analog, once phosphorylated, works as antimetabolite, being incorporated into growing DNA strands, acting as chain terminator and stops viral DNA. But being not specific to viral DNA, they also affect mithocondrial DNA, generating side effects such as bone marrow suppression. Moreover, it is not known if the RDV hot nebulization could alter the effectiveness of the drug administered by this route. There are approved clinical trial all over the world, trying to demonstrate the in vivo intravenous efficacy of this drug known for its in vitro activity[43]  .

In Italy, several studies involving RDV monotherapy in patients with COVID19 infection of different severity are underway and results are expected in the next two months. The opening of two Gilead sponsored international registration studies is imminent and several Asian and European centers will participate. For the Emilia Romagna region the centers currently included in the study are: AOU of Parma and the AUSL of Piacenza. The EC authorizations of AVEC are in progress. These consist in: 1) A Phase lll RCT in open-open in which 2 different RDV-based regimens (same dose, but different duration) will be compared on a population of 400 patients suffering from COVI-19 pneumonia in severe form that at the time of entry into the study do not require mechanical ventilation; 2) A phase lll open-label RCT in which 2 different RDV-based regimens (same dose, but different duration) versus the standard of care in a population of 600 patients with mild COVI19 pneumonia will be compared.",
