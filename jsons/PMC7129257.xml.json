Conditions that commonly lead to the development of prerenal hyperuricemia include dehydration, hypovolemia, and congestive heart failure. Renal origin of kidney disease refers to an intrarenal process, leading to a dramatic decrease in the glomerular filtration rate. In birds, a decrease in glomerular filtration rate can either be a sign of renal disease or an appropriate physiologic response to water restriction.3 Causes of renal disease in the avian patient include infectious nephritis, hypovitaminosis A, heavy metal intoxication, and renal neoplasia. Postrenal hyperuricemia occurs when there is a disruption of the integrity of the urinary tract or an obstruction of urine outflow (eg, urolithiasis).2\n",

Analgesia and adaptations of the environment are indicated in cases of renal disease associated with painful joints or spinal nerve compression. Other treatments vary with the underlying etiology and may include systemic antibiotics, antifungal therapy, vitamin A supplementation, chelation therapy, and agents to lower uric acid levels such as allopurinol. Potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be used with extreme caution in patients with renal disease. Additionally, drugs that are excreted through the kidney may fail to reach therapeutic plasma levels in polyuric birds or reach toxic levels if drug excretion and elimination are impaired.4\n",

Fluids are often administered by mouth by gavage with liquid oral nutrition. This route is generally safe and adequate for avian patients that are not in shock or debilitated.10 In birds with mild dehydration, fluids can also be provided subcutaneously. Subcutaneous fluids can be administered in the inguinal (Fig. 1\n), interscapular, or axillary regions. Volumes as great as 20 mL/kg may be administered in 1 location.9 Subcutaneous fluids are easily delivered using a butterfly needle, which allows the animal to move without the needle being pulled out. Practitioners unfamiliar with avian anatomy should beware of the thin skin and the presence of abdominal air sacs close to the inguinal region. Thus, it is key to remain steady during the procedure and to firmly hold the leg in extension to avoid inadvertent coelomic puncture. Fluids given subcutaneously and by mouth are poorly absorbed if hypovolemic shock is present.",

Permanent supervision of birds with IV catheters is also required to prevent fatal hemorrhage in case of accidental removal of the catheter.11 IO catheters can be placed quickly, are stable and reliable, and are relatively easy to maintain, but placement is more painful.

Owners can also increase the proportion of fruits and vegetables in the diet or offer moistened seeds or other foods like warm, unsalted vegetable soup. Caretakers may float seeds in the water bowl to encourage drinking behavior. Regular access to a shower or bath can also promote drinking, acknowledging that individual birds vary greatly in the ways they choose to bathe. Some birds love the feeling of a trickling shower, some enjoy daily misting with a spray bottle, and some like to dunk themselves in a pool of water.18 If none of these measures prove adequate and the bird is still not drinking in sufficient amounts, the owner can use a plastic eyedropper, syringe, or straw with finger kept over 1 end to slowly offer fluids directly into the beak, followed by positive reinforcement like verbal praise. Reserve this method as a last resort and inform owners of the risk of fluid aspiration.",

The cockatiels were able to upregulate enzymes associated with amino acid catabolism and uric acid synthesis.6 Of note, these cockatiels received a gradually increasing protein concentration in their diet over 3 weeks. Uric acid increased linearly with dietary protein levels, but remained within normal limits in these birds, indicating that hyperuricemia is specific of renal disease or severe dehydration in granivorous avian species. Because the nutritional requirements vary among avian species, it is unknown if these conclusions can be extrapolated to other birds. Unlike carnivorous birds, granivorous species have low requirements for dietary amino acids and seem to be able to conserve amino acids by tight regulation of amino acid catabolism.6 Frugivorous birds have lower rates of nitrogen loss compared with granivorous birds and, thus, even lower dietary protein requirements.20 A safe recommendation is that birds with hyperuricemia should not consume diets with protein levels greater than what is considered normal for the given species.16\n",

            "text": "Itraconazole, fluconazole, and voriconazole are the most studied azoles in birds. The relative toxicity of an azole depends on the affinity to fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme, compared with its affinity to the avian cytochrome P450.72 The most common adverse effects associated with azole administration in birds are anorexia, vomiting, and alterations in liver function.71\n,\n72 Regular bile acid monitoring is recommended during treatment for early detection of hepatic adverse effects. Itraconazole is a first-generation triazole antifungal agent, commonly used in birds for treatment of aspergillosis.75 Voriconazole is a third-generation triazole antifungal agent.71\n,\n75 Voriconazole is increasingly used to treat invasive aspergillosis in birds, given the broad antifungal spectrum, which includes molds (fungicidal) and yeasts (fungistatic), and its rapid bioavailability.72 Acquired resistance of Aspergillus fumigatus strains to both itraconazole and voriconazole has been reported.73\n,\n76 Fluconazole is a water-soluble fungistatic agent that is rapidly absorbed with high bioavailability after oral administration.69 A blue-fronted Amazon parrot with Aspergillus keratomycosis was successfully treated with oral and topical fluconazole.77\n",

Of note, fat-soluble vitamin A is considered safer than water-soluble vitamin A.117 Vitamin A supplements are also available in powder form.
