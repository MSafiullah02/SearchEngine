Separate pipes cleared waste-water and the run-off from heavy rains, and the Minoan palace even had a footbath for weary travellers.

The private villas of wealthy citizens boasted indoor plumbing, with flush toilets, and baths were often included in their dream homes, sometimes staffed by one or more athletes. Ordinary citizens made wide use of public baths. A water commissioner named Frontinus (40-103 CE) reported that under his jurisdiction there were 856 baths in Rome alone. Visitors to the baths gave their belongings to slaves, and then entered the cold-plunge-bath. After exercising in this pool, they moved into a warm and humid room where they sweated and were massaged. They could then progress to a yet warmer room with a mosaic floor immediately above the furnace, finishing with a brief spell of dry sweating in the hottest room of the facility.

However, leaders of a new sanitary movement such as Edwin Chadwick (1800-1890) and Thomas Southwood Smith (1788-1861) began to recognize that ill-health of the individual soon became ill-health of the population. They thus made urgent calls for the provision of clean drinking water, proper removal of refuse and sewage treatment. Chadwick and Smith sat as commissioners on London's General Board of Health that regulated the water supply and sewer connections for all new housing in the city, and provided adequate burial grounds for those who died. The quality of London's drinking water was rapidly upgraded, and money was spent on methods of preventing death during childbirth.

This problem is well exemplified by an epidemic of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). This began in mainland China in November of 2002, and due to delayed reporting by the Chinese authorities it spread rapidly around the world. The WHO issued a global health alert on April 11th 2003. Fortunately, application of rigid quarantine measures contained the epidemic, with relatively few deaths in North America, and by July 5th 2003, the WHO was able to declare that the SARS epidemic was over.",

Major cities such as London did not build a comprehensive infrastructure until the middle of the Victorian Era, when appropriate initiatives were taken by newly formed Boards of Public Health. Although the traditional concerns of public health have now been largely met in developed societies, new challenges are constantly arising. These include the control of tobacco products and mood-altering drugs, the reduction of automotive emissions and other forms of urban pollution, management of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, overcoming a growing reluctance to vaccinate infants, and countering the rapid spread of infections by air travel.",
