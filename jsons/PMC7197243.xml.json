Around 1900, heart muscle diseases were mentioned as such, but it was not until 1960 that the term \u201ccardiomyopathy\u201d or \u201cmyocardiopathy\u201d was used for the first time [2, 3]. Historically, cardiomyopathies or myocardiopathies were defined as genuine diseases of the heart muscle. This definition excluded as causes hypertension, congenital or valvular disease, pericarditis, and also ischemic cardiovascular disorders [4]. In 1980 the World Health Organization/International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHO/ISFC) Task Force defined it as \u201cheart muscle diseases of unknown cause [5].\u201d",

It described four phenotypes, which can be assessed by invasive and noninvasive imaging methods: dilated (DCM), hypertrophic, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, previously right ventricular dysplasia, and added nonclassified forms such as spongy myocardium as in previous classifications. These phenotypes were considered primary cardiomyopathies, that is, as heart muscle diseases of unknown cause. Myocarditis or autoreactive inflammatory cardiomyopathy emerged as secondary cardiomyopathies. In 2000 a task force of the World Heart Federation (formerly ISFC) defined myocarditis as an inflamed heart with 14 or more infiltrating cells and also recommended assessment of an underlying microbial etiology [7].",

Heart muscle disorders were still grouped according to morphology and function, as in previous classifications. Only a second step distinguished familial from nonfamilial/acquired disease [12]. In their position statement of 2008, cardiomyopathies were defined as \u201cmyocardial disorders in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal, and in which coronary artery disease, hypertension, and valvular and congenital heart disease are absent or do not sufficiently explain the observed myocardial abnormality.\u201d In contrast to the American definition, the European classification excludes ischemia or infarction as an underlying cause of DCM. If the ESC would have done so, DCM would have become the equivalent of heart failure. Therefore, in Europe ischemic cardiomyopathy is still a \u201cno go,\u201d and the term DCM is not used in the context of ischemia or postinfarction heart failure. However, patients with DCM may also have subtle coronary artery disease that does not explain reduced left ventricular function.",

The diagnostic assessment includes laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, biopsy, and/or bone scintigraphy. Causative treatment of immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis follows regimens used in the treatment of multiple myeloma. For many years, orthotopic liver transplantation was the only treatment available for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. Important advantages are offered by RNA silencers.
