With the primary source for many of these efforts being derived from data from the institution's EHR, it is critical to build, optimize, and share ensuing tools across institutions. In addition, it is important to create persistent data models that can reduce the duplication of efforts. This requires the development of reliable and reproducible data queries, analytics, and dashboards that can be broadly shared across health systems using similar EHRs or equivalently interoperable platforms.

Data harmonization efforts serve to coordinate institutions to, for example, adequately estimate the trajectory of the current pandemic and track how it can affect both care management and capacity management across healthcare systems. Finally, creating shared resources can also enable smaller health centers to track and share their progress and benefit from the activities of larger and more well-resourced organizations, with an ensuing benefit at the population level.

Further, we must consider how data-driven insights will be delivered \"at scale\", which in the light of limited technical resources during an on-going pandemic, must utilize existing technology infrastructure. End-users find data presented as time trends or as geospatial analyses helpful for informing care delivery and for anticipating patient surges.

We have developed multiple visualizations to identify \"hot spots\" of infections relying on zip-code level maps and more granular street-level data (with appropriate security to protect privacy).

            "text": "COVID-19 pandemic elucidates the essence of a true informatics problem, one that is first and foremost concerned with translating data into actionable knowledge, in this case at a speed we have not previously needed. The stress on the system is unprecedented and we must act using data-driven solutions. Informaticians can serve to link healthcare, research, and public health stakeholders and enable systems-level responses to the current crisis. As we have noted, achieving this potential impact is not easy, as issues such as barriers to access to data and data integration, lack of interoperability of communication channels and file sharing tools, and an inability to capture the \"big picture\" of the pandemic given a limited, often \"local\", slice of data, are pervasive. While we have not yet emerged from the current and high-intensity phase of this pandemic, we have sought to share key lessons learned at Washington University in St. Louis and BJC HealthCare, which seek to address and overcome the barriers in both the near-and longer-term. Our hope in doing so is to advance the state of informatics knowledge and practice as our community seeks to contribute to addressing this unprecedented public health crisis. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60 ",
