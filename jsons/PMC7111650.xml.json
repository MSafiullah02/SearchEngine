The spread of SARS was facilitated by the mobility of contemporary society (e.g. through air travel), continuing growth of the world population, and the steady rise in the number of highly populated urban areas, especially in Asia.

Donnellym et al. studied the epidemiology of SARS in Hong Kong5. Since the route of transmission is one of the most important questions,6 spatial analysis will help us to understand and control the contagion of a disease. The spatial process reflects interactions between the sites. Additionally, spatial linkages can be constructed to reflect different assumptions about the different possible pathways for the spread of an infectious disease.7 A join-count spatial statistics study was conducted, and various hypothetical diffusion processes of SARS in Beijing were tested using various definitions of \u2018joins\u2019.",

BW join-count statistics was used to measure the spatial autocorrelation of SARS in Beijing. If the district reported a SARS case, it was colour-coded black (B), and if not, the district was colour-coded white (W). When two districts had some defined relations such as a common boundary, they were considered to be linked by a \u2018join\u2019. A join may link two B districts, two W districts, or one B and one W district. Theses joins were called BB, WW and BW joins, respectively (Fig. 4\n). We counted the numbers of BB, WW and BW joins in Beijing districts, and compared these results with the expected numbers of BB, WW and BW joins under the null hypothesis, H0, with no spatial autocorrelation among the districts. There was little difference to choose which of the three statistics should be used as the indicator of autocorrelation, but the results of Cliff and Ord suggest that BW is superior to BB.9 The standard normal deviation (z scores) was used to test significance. High negative values indicate evidence of clustering, and high positive values indicate evidence of spacing12 (Fig. 4). Details of the formulae for the BW test, its power and its interpretation are discussed at length by Cliff and Ord.9\n",
