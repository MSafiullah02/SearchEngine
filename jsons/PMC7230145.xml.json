He had no known contacts with SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals, nor history of recent travel abroad. His peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 98%, heart rate 112 bpm, and body temperature 100.4 \u00b0F. SpO2 worsened over a few hours, requiring oxygen therapy. A chest CT scan showed interstitial pneumonia with ground-glass opacities. As he failed to meet strict epidemiological criteria for COVID-19, imaging findings were deemed compatible with bacterial infection. Azithromycin and piperacillin/tazobactam were started. Real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on nasal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive and he was transferred to the Infectious Diseases Unit (day 2 since hospitalization), where he received the Institutional treatment protocol for COVID-19 (200 mg bid hydroxychloroquine and 400/100 mg bid lopinavir-ritonavir). SpO2 deteriorated to 84% on high flow oxygen therapy. By day 6 he developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and was transferred to the General Intensive Care Unit (ICU), where after a trial of noninvasive mechanical ventilation he was sedated, intubated, curarized, and put on lung-protective mechanical ventilation. On day 12 he was tracheostomized. The clinical course was complicated by acute heart failure with severely reduced ejecton fraction and hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation and inotropes. In the meantime (day 8) he developed oligoanuric AKI requiring overall twenty 12-hour sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) sessions with citrate regional anticoagulation.3 On day 19 he was transferred to the Intensive Care section of the Renal Unit. Urinary output slowly increased without amelioration of renal function. Oropharyngeal swabs repeatedly tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. A kidney biopsy was performed on day 37. The patient later became afebrile and was successfully weaned-off from both ventilation and tracheostomy and transferred to the Inpatient Clinic of the Renal Unit. He is currently doing well and is afebrile with 96% SpO2 in ambient air. Renal function is slowly but steadily ameliorating with no current need for dialysis (last session on day 34; time of writing: day 51).",

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV differ in their point of entry into cells, the former entering via ACE-2 and the latter via DPP-4, both extensively expressed by human kidney epithelial cells.S8,S9 Despite extensive expression, in vitro studies showed that while both viruses could enter and replicate in immortalized human kidney epithelial cells, only MERS-CoV determined cytopathic effects (cell detachment and death), therefore implicating a possible causal relationship between kidney infection and AKI in MERS.6 The first live COVID-19 patient who underwent a kidney biopsy was a non-critically ill African American female with prior comorbidities (including chronic kidney disease) who developed AKI eventually requiring dialysis. She never developed ARDS. Since kidney biopsy showed collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, a high-interferon state induced by viral infection in the setting of APOL-1 high-risk status was hypothesized, while no evidence for virus infection was established based on in situ RNA hybridization and ultrastructural examination.7\n",

In SARS-related AKI, there was no evidence of viral tropism of the kidney despite detection of viral RNA fragments by RT-PCR in urinary samplesS13 and distal tubular cellsS14. Thus, kidney injury was ascribed to hemodynamic changes secondary to cytokine storm and ensuing capillary leak syndrome, rather than to direct target organ infection.4 An in vitro study, however, showed that productive infection of tubular and mesangial cells was attained by SARS-CoV, albeit with no cytopathic effect.8 In the current dramatic SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, indirect evidence from autopsy series raised the possibility of viral kidney tropism leading to AKI, although the low incidence of the latter argues against it.1\n,\n2\n",

Immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 antigen NP was positive in epithelial cells, which showed syncytia, a morphological correlate of viral cytopathy, leading the Authors to argue that altogether these findings proved viral tropism of the kidney. In a further autopsy series of 26 cases by Su et al.2 similar morphological and immunohistochemical findings were reported, with the addition of ultrastructural evidence of viral particles in both podocytes and tubular epithelial cells, with similar features to those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.2 Based on these findings, the Authors openly state that SARS-CoV-2 infection of renal parenchyma occurs, the virus being a direct effector of ATI.

During this pandemic we grew accustomed to unorthodox means of diffusion of scientific knowledge, including social media, not yet peer-reviewed articles, recommendations of empiric therapy based on very thin evidence (often changing overnight), and lots of buzz on presumed pathophysiology. We argue that our case reminds of the necessity, even during global emergencies, to support scientific statements with reproducible evidence, and to rigorously distinguish between observation, association and causal relationship. Indeed, failure to do so harbors the risk of translating questionable theories of disease pathogenesis into therapeutic trials with potential harm to patients. Table 1\n",
