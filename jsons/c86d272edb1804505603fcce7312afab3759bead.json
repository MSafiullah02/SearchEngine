These themes were found across the sample and the three groups. However, concerns over privacy, uptake and stigma were particularly significant amongst those state they will not be using the app and the view that the app is for the \"greater good\" was particularly significant amongst those who stated they will be using the app. One of the most common misconceptions about the app was that it could allow users to specifically identify and map COVID-19 cases amongst their contacts and in their vicinity. : medRxiv preprint CONCLUSIONS: We offer four recommendations: (1) To offset the fact that many people may not be accessing, or might be avoiding, news coverage on COVID-19, authorities must communicate to the public via a range of methods including but not limited to: social media ads, postal information, text messaging and other emergency alert systems. (2) Communications should emphasise that the app cannot enable the user to identify which of their contacts has reported COVID-19 symptoms or tested positive. (3) Communication should emphasise collective responsibility ('the greater good') to promote social norms around use of the app (4) Communication should provide a slogan that maximises clarity of message, for example: 'Download the app, protect the NHS, save lives'.",

As of 7 th May 2020, COVID-19 accounted for a reported one-quarter of a million deaths globally, and 30,000 deaths in the UK alone, with total numbers of cases and deaths increasing daily [1] . The novelty of the SARS-CoV-2 virus means that no vaccines or antiviral drugs are available. In the absence of biomedical interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical distancing, hand hygiene and restricted movement have been proposed, including the \"lockdown\" policy of only leaving the home when essential (implemented in the UK on 23 rd March 2020) [2] . Although highly effective as a means to significantly slow the transmission of the virus (that is, to lower its reproductive (R0) value) in the population, lockdown is a very strict strategy that has a number of significant adverse impacts, including wider economic impacts for society [3] and social and psychological impacts for individuals [4] . As such, it is necessarily a temporary and relatively short-term measure.",

It has successfully been used to control the spread of other novel communicable diseases like Ebola [5] . Traditionally, contact tracing relies on a team of health workers to track possible transmissions manually, through interviews with those who test positive for an infectious disease, in order to work out with whom they have recently been in close contact. Contacts deemed at risk are then informed of the fact they have been exposed and are then advised (or in some countries required) to self-.

Firstly, manual contact tracing on a large scale is highly resourceintensive. For instance, it is proposed that in the UK, a contact tracing team of 18,000 people will be employed [8] . Secondly, it has been argued that due to the speed at which COVID-19 spreads, manual contact tracing might be too slow to be effective on its own [9] . As such digital contact tracing has been proposed and is being actively explored in a number of countries, including the UK, as a potential supplement to manual contact tracing [10] .",

The app has attracted some criticism, as reported in the UK media, because of general concerns over privacy as well as because, unlike versions used or proposed in a number of other countries, it uses a 'centralised model' (i.e. where contact data is stored in a central database and not exclusively on the phones themselves) [12] . Although at time of writing, subsequent plans for the full release of the app to the total UK population were yet to be confirmed, it was suggested that the app would be rolled out sometime in May 2020 [13] . Modelling evidence suggests that in order for the app to be effective, use and adherence would need to be very high, with 80% of smartphone users (equivalent to 56% of the UK population) needing to use .

Some surveys have suggested that a majority of smartphone users would use the app [16] , but emerging evidence from early adopting countries like Singapore suggests that actual uptake might be considerably lower [17] . There is, to our knowledge, as yet no published qualitative research on public attitudes towards COVID-19 contact tracing apps. Qualitative research can provide an important supplement to large sample opinion polls involving an in-depth exploration of the reasons and motivations behind individuals' intentions towards use of contact tracing apps. If the UK's contact tracing strategy is to be effective, government and health authorities will need to understand and respond quickly to any public concerns over the app. The aim of this paper is to explore attitudes towards the proposed contact tracing app in a diverse sample of the UK public. Specifically, we seek to explore people's knowledge of the contact tracing app, their views on the app (specifically the extent to which they are favourable to it or not), and ultimately whether they plan to use the app or not.",

Improved communication regarding the purpose and nature of the app will likely lead to increased use of the app (see implications section below). Concerns over uptake were framed in terms of social inequalities and cultural norms around state interventionism. It was argued that because certain social groups do not have access to smartphones, and because the UK public would not be willing to accept contact tracing in general as a strategy, it would not be as effective as it had been in countries like Singapore or South Korea. Of course, the risk here, from a public health perspective is that if enough people feel that it is not going to be effective because not enough people are going to use it (and use this as a reason to not use it themselves) then their beliefs may contribute to a self-fulfilling prophesy at the population level. Thus, normative beliefs in the potential effectiveness of the app amongst the UK public are necessary in order to maximise uptake (see implication section below).

Those who said they would not download the app were motivated primarily by their moral opposition to the use of such technologies as an infringement of individual civil liberties. By contrast, among those who were intending on using the app, decision-making was driven by a more utilitarian evaluation of the relative costs and benefits. Many shared the same concerns as those who did not intend to use the app, but deemed that the potential life lost from COVID-19 outweighed any privacy infringements. Arguably, these participants viewed using the app to be a decision high in 'moral intensity', because of the temporal immediacy of the pandemic (its rapid spread), the magnitude of its consequences (its high death rates), and its concentration of effect (i.e. severe impacts (serious illness and death) amongst a relatively small number of people being greater than modest impacts (privacy risks) amongst a much larger number of people (total app users)) [26] . Finally, those who were undecided were generally still in the process of a utilitarian evaluation of the perceived costs and benefits of the contact tracing app. Therefore, if the UK is to achieve the high uptake levels that would be required in order to stop or even substantially reduce the spread of the virus, it is necessary to achieve the support of those who are as yet undecided on whether they are likely to use the app. Some ways in which governments and public health authorities can better communicate to the public around the COVID-19 contact tracing app are discussed below.",

Indeed, limiting watching news coverage on COVID-19 has been recommended as a means to protect mental health during the pandemic [28], and some people may be significantly avoiding news coverage.

I am not in favour of this app personally.\" (Participant 7, male, 20s) However, some of these concerns over privacy seemed to stem from the misunderstanding discussed in the previous section that app users would be able to identify specific covid-19 cases amongst their contacts or their vicinity: \"Imagine walking around, and thinking 'you've got it, you've got it' and you have got it [phone] in your hand \u2026 Imagine you were like, oh ill go see my friends when we are all allowed, and they were like 'You have got corona it says it on my app'\" (Participant 19, female, 20s)",
