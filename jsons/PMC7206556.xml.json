An infectious disease outbreak is a typical example of crisis in the public health context. Prior research has focused on how governments or other responsible organizations can achieve positive relationships with the public in managing a particular crisis. Based on the organization\u2013public relationship (OPR) approach, scholars have theorized and investigated various (pre)conditions, attributes, and communication strategies of organizations to bring about positive relational outcomes with the public, such as satisfaction, commitment, trust, and mutual understanding (S.-U. Yang, 2018). With respect to the MERS crisis in Korea, S.-U. Yang (2018) showed that the government\u2019s lack of dialogic competency negatively affected government\u2013public relationships. Those findings indicate that the Korean government\u2019s lack of mutuality and openness weakened the credibility of its risk information, which produced negative relational consequences such as distrust and dissatisfaction and the intent to dissolve the relationship.",

From a crisis management perspective, prior research has mainly focused on how to understand and work with the media to accomplish various goals (Reynolds & Seeger, 2005). For instance, researchers have identified the kinds of communication strategies that work best to reduce public-relations damage and generate compliance with desired behaviors in hazardous situations (Glik, 2007). For instance, Seeger, Reynolds, and Sellnow (2009) emphasized the importance of coordinating specific communication tasks for each crisis phase in the context of Hurricane Katrina and the H5N1 outbreak. Based on the existing literature and case studies, scholars have also attempted to provide guidelines for best practices in crisis communication (Veil et al., 2011), which could also be used as evaluative criteria in crises (Plattala & Vos, 2012).",

            "text": "Another line of research focuses on how media channels cover crises by analyzing the content of crisis reporting and discussing its implications. As manifested by terms such as disaster marathon (Liebes, 1998), the unexpected and impending nature of crises triggers media hype, which produces a prolific amount of reporting. Much research has investigated the characteristics of crisis coverage (Shih, Wijaya, & Brossard, 2008). Shih and colleagues (2008), for instance, found that the coverage of epidemics showed common patterns across discrete diseases, such as a high event-base and emphasis on newly identified cases and government actions. With respect to the MERS crisis in Korea, Jin and Chung (2018) performed semantic network analysis of Korean and foreign media coverage of the crisis. They examined the most frequently used words (e.g., patient, hospital, infection, government, and case) and concluded that Korean media focused heavily on the number of cases and the government\u2019s responses, consistent with Shih and colleagues\u2019 findings (see Kwon, 2016, for similar findings). Based on content analyses of crisis reporting, past research has also identified persistent problems in crisis reporting, such as excessiveness (Rezza, Marino, Farchi, & Taranto, 2004), inaccuracy (Auter, Douai, Makady, & West, 2016), and sensationalism (Moeller, 1999). Korean media\u2019s MERS reporting was not exempt from sensational and excessive coverage of the contagious nature of the disease and patient counts (Kim, 2016; Kwon, 2016).",

The heavy emphasis on knowledge is largely drawn from the traditional Knowledge Deficit Model of Communication (Rutsaert et al., 2014), which claims that a lack of understanding is the major obstacle to reasonable public responses to a risk or crisis. Therefore, it accentuates the scientific knowledge transfer from experts to the layperson and media have been regarded as a major conduit of knowledge transfer (Hilgartner, 1990). Thus, when a crisis happens, government and responsible organizations attempt to work with media to disseminate crisis-related information, and the general public turns mainly to the media to acquire the information to deal with the atmosphere of uncertainty. Despite that widespread expectation, relatively little empirical attention has been given to whether public crisis knowledge is indeed increased by media use or whether understanding of a crisis indeed facilitates preventive behaviors in times of crisis.",

Little empirical evidence, however, has been collected in the context of urgent public health crises such as epidemics. On the contrary, disaster studies have extensively examined individual and group responses to impending threats (e.g., natural disasters or terrorist attacks). According to that body of research, in the face of an impending threat, people become more sensitive to cues about social environments and engage in searches for information as a basis for protective behaviors (Lindell & Perry, 2004). However, despite the known contribution of media channels to these disaster research models, media variables have received insufficient attention in explaining the behavioral responses of individuals to crises.",

The results of 36 national surveys in the United Kingdom indicate that exposure to media coverage or advertising about swine flu increased the adoption of recommended preventive behaviors (G. Rubin, Potts, & Michie, 2010). Lin and Lagoe (2013) also showed that TV and newspaper use increased H1N1 risk perception and vaccination intent in media users.

According to Social Amplification Theory, the risk people feel when facing a crisis could be amplified or weakened by exchanging various forms of information via the news media or informal networks (Renn, Burns, Kasperson et al., 1992). Once a perceived risk is officially acknowledged, the distortion and exaggeration of information tend follow (Song, Song, Seo, Jin, & Kim, 2017), feeding a range of negative emotional responses.",

For instance, the media overstresses the horrific symptoms of contagious diseases regardless of facts about the prevalence of those symptoms in a time of outbreak (Moeller, 1999; Ungar, 2008). The media also tends to focus more on the spread of a disease and the body counts rather than scientific causes (D. Rubin & Hendy, 1977). These types of sensationalism can produce disproportionate public fear and panic responses to infectious diseases. Scholars such as Muzzatti (2005) have gone a step further and demonstrated that the media can actually manufacture threats to public health. Some prior works have examined the effects of media use on emotional reactions toward a crisis. Hoffner, Fujioka, Ibrahim, and Ye (2002), for instance, found that people who learned about the September 11 terrorist attacks through mass media were more likely to report negative emotions than those who heard the news interpersonally. They attributed that difference to the nature of the live pictures and content in mass media crisis reporting.",

However, other convincing literature has claimed that emotions can trigger behavioral responses that are benign and adaptive (Baumeister, Vohs, DeWall, & Zhang, 2007). Negative emotional experiences can stimulate people to seek pertinent information (e.g., the Risk Information Seeking and Processing (RISP) Model, Griffin et al., 1999) and encourage them to take preventive actions (e.g., Protection Motivation Theory [PMT], Boer & Seydel, 1996). Unlike the cognition-based approach, which emphasizes the role of knowledge, these theoretical models focus on how negative emotions work as motivational drivers to guide people to protect themselves. Empirical work has supported those claims by showing that negative emotion can drive positive behavioral responses, including adopting recommended health behaviors (Ruiter, Abraham, & Kok, 2001) and engaging in information seeking (Z. J. Yang & Kahlor, 2013).",

In addition, poor government handling of that crisis reduced the credibility of the information it provided (S.-U. Yang, 2018).

Because information disseminated through social media is often unverified, identifying accurate data and valid sources can be challenging and could both undermine relevant knowledge and exacerbate the consequences of emotional and behavioral responses.

In addition, social media generally deal with a rapid exchange of information, which could be more appropriate for short and clear MI than for scientific knowledge about a crisis. For instance, Won, Bae, and Yoo (2015) conducted an issue word analysis of SNS messages during the MERS outbreak and reported the six most frequently mentioned words on SNS at that time. Two of the six words were mask and hand sanitizer, which are clearly related to preventive behaviors. The other four words were hospital, infection, coughing, and checkup, which are also at least indirectly related to preventive behaviors. However, a big data analysis examining online news sites found that posts about symptoms, government reaction, disease treatment, business impacts, and rumors ranked higher than prevention-related information (Song et al., 2017). Therefore, the effects of social media use on crisis knowledge and preventive behaviors might differ from those of traditional media.",

Recent works on the MERS crisis have shown that about 80% of the buzzwords on social media during the MERS crisis were negatively charged emotional words such as fear and anxiety (S. Choi et al., 2017; Song et al., 2017). Those works suggest that social media might be more likely than traditional media to magnify negative emotional responses. On the contrary, some prior works have found that people use social media for social support in crisis situations (Y. Choi & Lin, 2009). That phenomenon could lessen the negative emotional responses in social media users. Therefore, it is worth investigating how the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to social media use differ from those to traditional media use, which raises the following research question:",

However, I did not find significant cognitive effects from social media use. Compared with traditional media, which mainly report information verified by expert sources (Lowrey, 2004), social media can not only convey knowledge but also disseminate false or unverified information during a crisis. The null effect of social media use on MERS knowledge might thus result from the conflicting content of social media.

Compared with carefully designed campaign messages intended to scare people to act properly with respect to a given risk, media messages could more likely be crude and mixed with various intentions (e.g., sensational reports to secure audience attention). Indeed, there is a lack of empirical research examining what kinds of crisis-specific responses could be elicited from the media individuals choose to use in times of crisis. In addition, RISP research provides a useful theoretical framework to predict that negative emotions could motivate people to seek information about a risk. However, this framework did not pay attention to media use, which can lead to behavioral consequences such as preventive behaviors beyond information seeking. This study addressed these gaps in the literature by directly testing the roles of negative emotions and media as potential sources of those emotions during a pandemic, which has been rarely examined in previous studies.",

Yang (2018) noted that Koreans in general tended to perceive the government\u2019s mutuality and openness in communication somewhat unfavorably, which often negatively affected government-public relationships. As S.-U. Yang (2018) showed, the Korean government\u2019s lack of mutuality and openness seems to have deteriorated the credibility of its risk information, which may have worsened the public\u2019s trust and satisfaction with the government. This unique situation might have lowered not only the credibility of government information but also the credibility of information from news media that relied heavily on the government for information. Accordingly, the low credibility of public information on MERS can explain the limited role of knowledge in promoting desirable behavioral responses. Prior work examining a different epidemic crisis found that one material factor influencing preventive action was respondent opinion about authorities (Quah & Hin-Peng, 2004). My finding thus suggests that simple acquisition of disseminated scientific knowledge might not necessarily produce desirable behavioral responses from the public. It also implies that contextual factors, such as government dialogic competency, should be considered to fully grasp the role of knowledge in times of crisis.",

First, compared with traditional media, which is known to be powerful in knowledge diffusion, the interpersonal channel has been considered effective on behavioral responses via the normative route (Price & Oshagan, 1995). The role of normative pressure on behavioral adaptation has been well documented in the health communication literature (e.g., Planned Behavioral Intention Model, Ajzen, 1991).

Indeed, a prior work analyzing social media content during the MERS crisis reported that preventive behavior\u2013related terms (e.g., masks and hand sanitizers) were the most frequently mentioned words (Won et al., 2015). Furthermore, the most needed information at the beginning of the MERS crisis was the list of MERS-affected hospitals, which the Korean government had withheld. Given the government\u2019s unwillingness to share the list of hospitals, the public resorted to social media to actively seek, exchange, and share the hospital-related information. That piece of information could single-handedly trigger one preventive behavior (i.e., avoiding specific hospitals to protect themselves). Indeed, hospital was one of the terms most frequently used on social media during the MERS crisis (Won et al., 2015). However, a big data analysis of traditional media reported that words such as infection, confirmed cases, and death were centrally located in traditional media content (Kwon, 2016). In short, compared with traditional media, social media might play an essential role in virally diffusing MI (specific behavioral information, including where not to go and what to do).",

Yang, 2018), some technological features of social media may have enhanced communication mutuality and openness which the Korean government and media lacked. Communication through social media may allow users to share empathy and social support. At the same time, social media-mediated communication can be perceived as more accessible and open than media-mediated communication. Strong mutuality and openness perceived through communication with network members on social media could have increased the credibility of MI which could have enhanced behavioral responses at least during the MERS crisis in Korea.",

This is quite an interesting finding because the Korean government strongly criticized media, especially social media, for releasing unverified rumors and fears. The lack of association between social media use and negative emotional responses could be a result of canceling out effects. In other words, social media might induce fear and anxiety, but social media might effectively cancel out the negative emotions by providing wanted social supports or MI, which should be under solid empirical scrutiny in the future study.",

The data are not based on a representative sample, which means the study findings must be interpreted with caution. For instance, online panels tended to include the younger and the more educated compared with the general population, which could influence the interpretation of the role of social media and traditional media use during the MERS crisis in Korea. The measurement of key variables also has limitations. For example, traditional media use was assessed only for newspaper and television. Omitting radio and general Internet use should be recognized as another major limitation of the study. Also, using quiz-type questions to tap MERS knowledge without close validation and planning might have contributed to the low correlation between the two MERS knowledge measures, which also raises a concern about a test\u2013retest error involved in the panel data. These measurement issues could produce errors, which would be carried into the hypothesized path model this study proposed. In addition, Wave 1 data did not include MERS preventive behavior measures, which made it impossible to control all the endogenous variables in Wave 1 data. Therefore, it is hard to argue that an ideal panel data analysis was conducted for testing the proposed hypotheses.",
