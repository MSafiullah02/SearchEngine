We simulate the aerodynamic flow through the mask and the spatial spread of droplet ejecta resulting from respiratory events such as coughing or sneezing. Without a mask, a turbulent jet forms, and droplets with a broad size distribution are ejected. Large droplets (greater than about 125 \u00b5m in diameter) fall to the ground within about 2 m, while turbulent clouds transport a mist of small aerosolized droplets over significant distances (\u2248 5 m), consistent with reported experimental findings. A loosely fitted simple cotton cloth mask (with a pore size \u2248 4 microns) qualitatively changes the propagation of the high velocity jet, and largely eliminates the turbulent cloud downstream of the mask. About 12% of the airflow leaks around the sides of a mask, considering a uniform gap of only 1 mm all around, between the face and the mask. The spread of ejecta is also changed, with most large droplets trapped at the mask surface. We present the viral load in the air and deposited around the person, and show that wearing even a simple cloth mask substantially decreases the extent of spatial spread of virus particles when an infected person coughs or sneezes.",

To ensure that surgical masks and N95 respirators are available to those at greatest risk of infection, the World Health Organization 6 and national agencies have recommended against their use by the general public. Even so, greatly increased demand during the Covid-19 pandemic has seen a global shortage of such PPE.",

However, there has been considerable controversy 10, 11, 12, 13 over the efficacy of home-made reusable cloth face masks. One report 14 suggests that the use of a homemade face mask would be better than \"no protection at all\". In South East Asian countries, the practice of using face masks for combating pollution or for personal hygiene is widespread. This has been cited 15 as an important factor in controlling the transmission of Covid-19 infections. However, there are concerns that the use of facemasks may decrease the rigour in following strict physical distancing and handwash hygiene. Further, incorrect use of masks, for example, wearing masks incorrectly or touching the outer surface of masks can result in adverse outcomes. SARS-CoV2 has been found 16 on the surface masks worn by infected patients, and has been shown 17 to remain viable on the surface of surgical masks for several days. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the benefits of wearing homemade cloth masks would be useful in determining policy on their recommended and possible mandatory use.",

Transmission of Covid-19 is currently believed 18, 19, 20 to happen primarily through shedding of virus particles in droplets ejected as infected people speak, cough or sneeze, or through contact with viable infective virus deposited on surfaces. When people cough or sneeze 21 (or even simply talk loudly 22, 23 ) , they eject droplets of mucosal fluid. Large droplets ~O(100 \u00b5m) fall due to gravity and, under no wind conditions, are transported over lateral distances of the order of 1 m. However, turbulent flows resulting from violent expulsions during sneezing or coughing suspend finer droplets and transport them over large distances, of the order of 7-8 m. 24, 25, 26 Therefore, it has been suggested that transmission of infection through fine droplets be investigated. 27, 28, 29 The effect of surgical masks and N95 respirators on airflows (but not spread of droplet ejecta) during expiratory events has been experimentally imaged. 30 Here, we employ Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to address the influence of homemade face masks on the turbulent clouds that result due to sneezing events, and on the lateral extent of spread of ejecta. Our emphasis is on understanding the effect of face masks in altering the flow field and droplet dispersion due to the respiratory event.",

We model the dynamics of turbulent air jets using timeaveraged Navier-Stokes mass and momentum conservation equations. The Renormalization Group (RNG) k-epsilon model is used to model the turbulence, allowing us to span high velocity turbulent flows to lower velocity flows. We employ the enhanced wall treatment model in combination with RNG k-epsilon model to account for the viscous sublayer near the wall surface. A detailed description of the equations and models is given elsewhere, 31 and a brief summary is provided in the supporting information (Section A). For the discrete droplet phase, equations of motion are solved for each droplet to model its trajectory. Droplets can exchange mass (due to vaporization), momentum and energy with the continuous fluid phase. Droplets are convected by the continuous phase and can, in turn, affect the flow of the continuous phase (two way coupling between the fluid and droplet phase). To reduce computational time, half the domain is simulated assuming symmetry in geometry and flow features. Ambient conditions (35 o C, 60% relative humidity) representative of summer conditions in India are assumed.",

Without a mask, a highly turbulent jet with large mean square velocity fluctuations propagates axially away from the face (Figure 1 d) . This is virtually eliminated by the mask (Figure 1 f) . At t = 0.1 s, the centerline velocity through the face decreases from \u2248 50 m/s to \u2248 40 m/s over 0.2 m. We note that the velocity reported here is exactly at the centreline. Therefore, these values are higher than the experimentally measured peak velocities of the jet, that are likely averaged around the centreline. At 0.2 s after the respiratory event, the centreline velocity immediately after the face is about 30 m/s, and decreases to about 20 m/s at 0.2 m. In contrast, the centreline velocities drop to less than 5 m/s within 0.02 m when a mask is worn (Figure 1 f) . Correspondingly, when no mask is worn, the centerline turbulent kinetic energy decreases from about 8 m 2 /s 2 to 2 m 2 /s 2 at 0.05 m from the face at t = 0.1 s, and then rises to 47 m 2 /s 2 at a distance of 0.25m from the face as the entrained air forms a turbulent cloud (Figure 1 h). When a mask is worn, the turbulent kinetic energy rises near the mask due to the increase in mean square velocity fluctuations as the expelled jet impinges on the mask. However, due to the resistance to the flow presented by mask, it rapidly decreases immediately after the mask and approaches 0 m 2 /s 2 at 0.04 m from the face. The dissipation of the turbulent flow field tracks the trend in the turbulent kinetic energy. Without a mask, it decreases by about 10-fold over 0.05 m (for t = 0.1 s) and then rises reaching a maximum at 0.2 m, while wearing a mask results in a rapid decrease by over 3 orders of magnitude over a distance of 0.05 m (Figure 1 i) .

We observe the time dependent trajectories of large and small droplets with time from the respiratory event (Figure 2 ). Without a mask (Figure 2, top panel) , large drops are not convected by the flow and rapidly fall to the ground: drops > 200 \u00b5m fall within a lateral distance of 0.2 m, while drops > 125 \u00b5 m extend to about 2 m (SI, Figure S6 ). In contrast to the large drops, smaller drops (< 25 \u00b5 m in size) are convected by the turbulent cloud. They shrink in size as their water content is completely evaporated, and are transported to significant distances, as far as 5 m from the face (SI, Figure S7 ). We observe that the non-volatile content in these drops continues to stay suspended for as long as 60 s. Our data is consistent with the experimental literature. 25 Wearing even a simple cotton mask restricts the spatial transport of droplets (Figure 2 , bottom panel). Large droplets (> 4 \u00b5m) are trapped by the mask while smaller droplets are transported by the flows through the surface of the mask and through the openings on the sides. At t = 0.4 s, droplet ejecta is transported over less than 0.3 m (as compared to well over 2 m, without a mask). Thus, large droplets are trapped by the mask while the damping of the turbulent flow field by the mask leads to smaller droplets being transported only over relatively short distances. Flow through the openings around the mask convects small droplets along the face, in contrast to the case without a mask. We estimate the potential viral concentrations suspended in the air and deposited on the floor due to propagation of droplets from the respiratory event of an infected person. Recent literature 37 indicates that the SARS-CoV2 load in throat swabs on patients within the first 5 days of the infection averages 6.76 x 10 5 RNA copies/mL. For sputum samples, an average of 7 x 10 6 RNA copies/mL was observed. Based on these, in these simulations we assume a representative viral concentration of 10 6 particles/mL in the ejecta, to estimate the potential spatial dispersion of the virus. When an infected person not wearing a mask sneezes or coughs, virus particles in the large droplets rapidly drop to the floor. By t = 60 s, \u2248 37% of the potential viral load in the ejecta is deposited on the floor while \u2248 63% remains in the air. Most of the virus particles that are deposited on the floor are within 2 m from the person, with a maximum virus density \u2248 10 cm -3 at about 0.2 m from the person (Figure 3 a, d) . The suspended aerosolized virus particles form a low density cloud that extends from 2 to 5 m. At the centerline passing through the face, the suspended concentration \u2248 10 -3 cm -3 (Figure 3 a, c) .",

Flow through the mask surface and leakage flows from the openings around the mask result in generating a cloud, potentially conveying virus to a distance of about 1.5 m from the face. At the centerline passing through the face, this cloud has a density of 10 -2 cm -3 within about 1.5 m from the person (Figure 3 b, c) . However, the suspended concentration drops significantly after 1.5 m from the person, and there is virtually no deposition of droplets on the ground (Figure  3 b, c) . Thus, there is a clear qualitative difference in the distribution of virus particles when the infected person wears a mask. Without a mask, high concentrations of potentially virus-laden droplets are deposited on the floor within 2 m of the person and a dilute suspended cloud is observed over 2 -5 m. In contrast, when a mask is worn, there is no deposit on the ground since most of the virus is deposited on the mask. Virus particles stay suspended within 1.5 m of the person, but this suspended concentration falls off sharply after that distance.",

When a person not wearing a mask coughs or sneezes, the emanating jet sets up turbulent flows at distances of several meters from the person. While the large mucosal droplets fall to the floor within a distance of 2 m, the turbulent clouds continue to suspend aerosols at distances up to 5 m, for over a minute after the respiratory event. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, most of the virus deposits on the floor within a meter of the person. However, a dilute aerosol stays suspended, potentially carrying virus particles. In contrast, wearing a mask dissipates the turbulent flows passing through the mask, and diverts about 12% of the flow to the openings at the sides of the mask. The vast majority of the virus particles are retained on the mask and face. At t = 60 s, a cloud of virus particles (10-fold higher in density compared to the case without the mask) stays suspended within 1.5 m of the person. Our results strongly suggest that airborne transmission from patients (especially asymptomatic or presymptomatic patients) can be greatly reduced by wearing a simple cotton mask and maintaining strict physical distancing of 2 m.

Pressure drop versus velocity data obtained from the thesis and shown below in Figure S1 can be fitted to obtain the Darcy (proportional to v) and non-Darcy inertial (proportional to v 2 ) components of the resistance to flow. For the jet coming from the mouth, a time dependent velocity profile is applied with peak velocity time (PVT) of 0.1 sec as shown in Figure S3 . Cough peak flowrate (CPFR) is derived using the formulation reported by Gupta et al. 3 To simulate varied human expirations, various cough expired volume (CEV) values are used corresponding to very weak, medium and very strong expirations. To simulate the spray of droplets, a Rosin-Rammler distribution method is used for the injection. 94% of injected droplet mass fraction represents evaporating sprays and the remaining 6% represents the non-volatile matter. A total 6.1 mg of droplets are injected using 10 injections with equal distribution among the injections. The initial droplet positions are staggered over 0.01 m. Conditions used for the baseline simulation are shown in Table S2 . A user defined function (UDF) has been used to filter the droplets from the mist generated by the respiratory event. We model filtration by cloth with reference to reported experimental literature. Guyton et. al. 4 measure the filtration efficiency of a single layer of fabric typical of bath towels, cotton shirts, handkerchiefs, etc. and report the penetration efficiency of 2 \u00b5m particles. Rengasamy et. al. 5 report the penetration efficiency of cotton cloth for a range of particle sizes (up to 1 \uf06dm in size). We use a conservative estimate for the penetration efficiency of the cotton mask used in this work and implement a simplified filtering mechanism such that all droplets above 4 \u00b5m diameter are filtered out while droplets below 4 \uf06dm are allowed to pass through the mask. This boundary condition is applied when the droplets hit the surface of the mask.",
