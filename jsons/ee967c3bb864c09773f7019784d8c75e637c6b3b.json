I focus on various interpretations of NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in the September 11, 2001 , terrorist attacks; the sinking of a Chinese ferry in 1999; and the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic to explore how Chinese citizens negotiated between their own ambivalent loyalties and the contradictory official, unofficial, local, national, and international narratives in which these events were embedded. These negotiations suggest that global information flows are creating a transnational panopticon that increasingly enables neoliberal governmentality to operate on transnational levels. [China, globalization, media, citizenship, nationalism, identity, death] I n this article, I examine how Chinese citizens used a discourse of Chinese backwardness to make sense of tragic news events while simultaneously trying to avoid becoming identified with that backwardness. I focus here on four events that provoked powerful emotional responses among Chinese citizens I met in the course of my research among urban Chinese families and among youth from China studying in Europe, the United States, and Australia: 1 the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade on May 8, 1999;  terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001 (9/11); a Chinese shipwreck on November 24, 1999; and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic that originated in China and spread worldwide in the spring of 2003 . Although many other events in the news as well as in the daily lives of Chinese people I knew also provoked discussions of the issues of backwardness and modernization that I explore in this article, I have chosen to focus on these four events because they were discussed by the largest number of people I knew in Dalian for the longest time after they occurred. By examining how discourses of backwardness and modernization shaped Chinese reactions to these tragic news events, I show how the increasing speed, intensity, and volume of global information flows are enabling the panoptic schema and governmentality described by Michel Foucault (1977 , 1979 , 1983 to operate not only at the individual and national levels but also on the world stage.",

Although tragedies are overwhelming when they seem senseless (Behar 1991) , they can serve as sites of meaning making when they are interpreted as part of broader narratives. As Eric Mueggler notes, \"Mourning engages with power not as private, micropolitical maneuvering, but as a collective ethics, meant to manage the ways the daily, creative activity of production is brought into relation with abstract economic forces and the political authority imagined to underlie them\" (1998:983) . Tragic news events like those I discuss in this article are thus important sites for struggles over political meanings, which in China often revolve around the manipulation of information that can affect perceptions and constructions of China's image on the world stage.",

As the post-Mao government began promoting globalization and a market economy, however, its control over information flows weakened. Mayfair Yang (1997, 2002) observed that global information flows liberated Chinese citizens from the centralized power of the Chinese state, even while drawing them and the Chinese state itself toward global capitalism. As telephones, televisions, radios, cell phones, Internet access, foreign language skills, international travelers, and Chinese citizens who had spent time abroad became increasingly common in China (Constable 2003; Link et al. 2002; Louie 2000; Lozada 2006; Nonini and Ong 1997; Pieke et al. 2004; Siu 2005; Smart and Smart 1998) , it became difficult for the Chinese state to control the flow of information into, out of, and within China. Global information flows carried international narratives of Chinese backwardness in ways that alarmed Chinese citizens, even as such narratives enabled them to construct alternatives to the perspectives presented by the statecontrolled Chinese media and to use these alternatives to critique the Chinese state.",

Like their predecessors in the Maoist government, post-Mao Chinese leaders have trumpeted China's achievements of modernization (xiandaihua). At the same time, they have encouraged the state-controlled media to use depictions of Chinese backwardness to dramatize such achievements. The Maoist government had promoted \"speaking bitterness\" (suku) rituals, during which people publicly declared how they had suffered prior to Communist rule (Anagnost 1997) . Drawing on a similar strategy, the post-Mao government often condoned media representations of Chinese backwardness to legitimate its own role as rescuer of the Chinese nation, co-opting the same international discourses of Chinese backwardness that Chinese citizens often used to critique the Chinese state. But unlike Maoist \"speaking bitterness\" rituals, which recalled how backward China had been prior to Maoist rule, post-Mao representations of backwardness were often drawn from the present or the very recent past.",

Although Foucault's discussions of the panopticon focus on institutions such as hospitals, workshops, schools, and prisons, he also argues that \"Whenever one is dealing with a multiplicity of individuals on whom a task or a particular form of behaviour must be imposed, the panoptic schema may be used \" (1977:205) .

I extend their analysis by using ethnographic observations grounded in a longitudinal study of the lives of Chinese individuals to show how global information flows have created a transnational panopticon that works simultaneously at the individual, national, and global levels. This transnational panopticon enforces a transnational, neoliberal governmentality that disciplines the behaviors of governments as well as the individuals they govern. As the institutions, experts, and standards for individual self-governance instrumental to governmentality have become increasingly globalized and transnational, so has governmentality itself.",

These countries are often referred to as the \"First World\" or the \"core regions,\" recognize each other as political and military allies, and participate in reciprocal visa waiver programs that allow each other's citizens to travel quickly and easily across each other's boundaries while strictly excluding citizens of developing countries. Australia, Canada, Japan, the United States, and the western European countries are usually included on each other's lists of developed countries and are recognized as developed countries by leaders and citizens of countries that are not on those lists. Chinese people commonly refer to the developed countries as \"fada guojia,\" in contrast to China and other \"fazhanzhong guojia\" (developing countries). 2 Although national borders are important for separating the developed from the developing, they are also porous enough to allow the developed world to encompass developed individuals from developing countries. As Aihwa Ong notes, neoliberalism \"is allied to a moralized system of distributive justice that is detachable from legal citizenship status\" (2006:16) , and the rise of \"flexible citizenship\" (Ong 1999) has enabled enterprising individuals to transcend the borders of their developing countries. Global information flows move through and are shaped by all countries that participate in the global neoliberal system, but they are dominated by the developed world, and particularly by the developed countries with the greatest economic, military, and political power (Caton 1999; Pedelty 1995; Peterson 2003; Velthuis 2006) . Although the global neoliberal governmentality that results in and from global information flows is accepted and promoted (albeit to varying degrees) by all countries and individuals that are part of the developed world or seeking to join it, it disproportionately draws support from and favors the perspectives of those countries and individuals with a disproportionate share of economic, military, and political power (Hardt and Negri 2001; Harvey 2003; Ho 2004; Lutz 2006; Wood 2003) .",

Media producers from developed countries situate China in often contradictory but coexisting narratives of \"China as powerful rival and threat\" and \"China as poor, backward country stuck in the past.\" The particular emphases of these narratives may vary from country to country and from individual to individual, but the technologies and economics of the developed countries' news media ensure a remarkable consensus in the broader narratives they produce about developing countries (Baisnee and Marchetti 2006; Hannerz 2004; Peterson 2003; Sreberny and Paterson 2004) . At the same time, in a world of increasingly rapid, powerful, and difficult-to-block global information flows, developed countries' narratives have themselves become products of, as well as sources for, the contradictory but coexisting narratives of backwardness and modernity produced by developing countries (Bishara 2006; Caton 2006; Ferguson and Gupta 2002; Hasty 2005; Nyamnjoh 2005; Ong 1999 Ong , 2006 Pedelty 1995; Pederson 2003; Smith 2007; Stahlberg 2002) . Such struggles over narratives of modernity and backwardness frame the reactions of Chinese leaders, journalists, and citizens when they are confronted with tragic news events.",

Such progress could be measured objectively by statistical indicators of health, education, living standards, demographic patterns, and per-capita GDP and subjectively by the degree of a society's cultural resemblance to the countries widely acknowledged as developed (Fong 2004b; Greenhalgh 2003b Greenhalgh , 2005a Greenhalgh , 2005b .",

This narrative portrays developed countries as existing in the present and developing countries as existing in the past and denies their contemporaneity and mutual influence (Fabian 1983) . Although this narrative has saturated everyday and official discourses in developing as well as developed countries, its roots lie in the imperialist-colonialist campaigns that originated in western Europe (Wolff 1994) . This narrative was eventually adopted by most countries worldwide. The global neoliberal system of today is rooted in the capitalist world system, which began with the emergence of capitalism in western Europe during the 15th century, spread until it encompassed almost every area of the world, and based itself on an international division of labor that divided the world into \"core\" and \"peripheral\" regions (Wallerstein 1974 (Wallerstein , 1979 (Wallerstein , 1998 Wallerstein and Smith 1992) . Teleological, allochronic, unilineal evolutionist discourses were developed by the core regions to explain and justify the inequalities that structured the capitalist world system and to legitimate that system by promising an evolutionist path by which peripheral countries and individuals that played by the rules of the capitalist world system could modernize and eventually become part of the developed world. As the developed countries became increasingly invested in globalization, a knowledge-based economy, and Western-style democracy, the capitalist world system increasingly based itself on neoliberalism, which David Harvey defined as a \"theory of political economic practices that proposes that human well-being can best be advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills within an institutional framework characterized by strong private property rights, free markets, and free trade\" (2005:2) . As the proportion of individuals who submitted to neoliberal governmentality increased, the capitalist world system developed into a global neoliberal system. This system is based on the same hierarchies and exchanges that structured the capitalist world system but offers individuals greater opportunities for deterritorialization, flexible citizenship, and transcendence of state sovereignties (Ong 1999 (Ong , 2006 .",

Some accepted teleological narratives but inverted these narratives' implicit prestige hierarchies by emphasizing the superiority of the past and the inferiority of the present, or asserted that they themselves were actually part of the developed present rather than the backward past (Berdahl 1999; Glaeser 2000; Herzfeld 1987) . Although some countries and some individuals are more likely than others to favor one or another of them, these discourses usually coexist in the same country and can also be espoused by the same individual at different times, as I often saw in my discussions with Chinese citizens.",

Because of the identification with China that I felt as a person of Chinese descent and because of the values I held as an anthropologist with egalitarian ideals, I was initially dismayed that just about everyone I met in China complained about their country's inferiority to developed countries. I insisted to them that developed countries had their own share of problems, such as poverty, loneliness, violence, crime, racism, family instability, and overcommodification, and that Chinese life had many advantages missing in developed countries, such as stronger ties of kinship and friendship and the excitement and opportunities that came with rapid social change. Chinese citizens who heard my arguments insisted that developed countries' problems were natural and inconsequential compared with Chinese problems, claimed that what I considered Chinese advantages were actually Chinese problems, and redoubled their condemnation of China. They chided me for forsaking my duty, as an \"American scholar\" with \"the most modern education,\" to criticize backward aspects of Chinese society. As one high school teacher told me, \"We need you to tell us which of our methods are unscientific, so we can modernize.\" Like many anthropologists from developed countries who work in developing countries where people yearn to become part of the developed world (Gutmann 2002; Lemon 1998; Pigg 1996; Schein 2000) , I was often put in the uncomfortable position of being asked to evaluate the progress the society I studied was making toward becoming more similar to developed countries, even though I felt ambivalent about whether attaining such similarity was a desirable goal.",

To my surprise, my Chinese interlocutors responded with indignation. Many who started out complaining about China's problems switched, as soon as I concurred with them, to passionately defending China, saying that the problems they had complained about were inevitable because of historical and economic circumstances, were not the fault of the Chinese government or people, were likely to be overcome soon, and were similar to or less serious than problems in developed countries. My defense of China had positioned me as a loyal Chinese descendant eager to downplay Chinese backwardness. As long as I played this role, Chinese citizens felt comfortable about including me in a zone of cultural intimacy in which complaints about Chinese backwardness were safe, and they even suggested that I should criticize China as well. As soon as I did so, however, I positioned myself as an arrogant American and a disloyal Chinese who had to be reminded of the importance of protecting cultural intimacies. This pattern was often repeated during discussions of news events that highlighted inequalities between China and developed countries.",

From March 24 to June 10, 1999, NATO forces conducted air strikes to force Serbia to withdraw its troops from Kosovo, a Serbian province where the Albanian majority was demanding autonomy. The Chinese government opposed these air strikes because they could set a precedent for foreign military intervention to help Taiwan gain independence from China. The Chinese media did not present extensive coverage of the situation, however, until May 8, 1999, when NATO forces bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, killing three Chinese journalists and injuring 20 other Chinese citizens who were staying at the embassy. NATO officials insisted that the destruction of the Chinese embassy was an accident caused by pilots' use of inaccurate maps, but Chinese officials insisted that the attack was a deliberate attempt to bully China into submission. The Chinese officials' narrative was featured prominently in the Chinese media's extensive coverage of the bombing. This narrative cast China as a victim of \"imperialism\" (diguozhuyi) and \"hegemonism\" (baquanzhuyi) perpetrated by the \"U.S.-led NATO\" (meiguo weizhu de beiyue). This narrative of China's victimization produced an outpouring of nationalistic sentiment, as Chinese citizens rushed to defend their bullied fatherland. At the same time, however, it also served to define China as a backward nation that could be bullied by foreign powers and had little ability to retaliate. Images disseminated by the Chinese media portrayed a Chinese population united in its anger at China's victimization, but a discourse that criticized the Chinese government for being too weak to retaliate flourished in everyday conversations.",

The story was written by China's official news service, which could not have used such strong language without the Chinese central government's approval. At the center of the front page was a picture of college students shouting, holding Chinese flags, and raising their fists in protest outside the U.S. embassy in Beijing. The story accompanying the photo was headlined, \"Resolutely Support Our Government's Official Pronouncement Strongly Condemning Act of American Hegemonism: College Students of Beijing and Shanghai March in Protest of NATO's Bombing of Our Embassy in Serbia\" (Xinhua News Service 1999c). With encouragement from the Chinese media and permission from police and school officials, college students in Dalian and other cities throughout China marched in protest, bearing banners proclaiming slogans such as \"Safeguard China's sovereignty,\" \"Long live China,\" \"Strongly condemn American imperialism,\" and \"Revenge for blood debts.\" Protesters damaged U.S. embassies and burned down the U.S. consulate general's residence in Chengdu, a southwestern Chinese city.

In response to those orders, the protests had ended immediately and peacefully. College student Xiao Chen explained to me that she felt that violent conflict between protesters and police would play right into the hands of foreign imperialists who \"want China to be chaotic and weak\" because \"they won't need to bomb us if we bomb ourselves.\" Concerned that violent protests and defiance of the state would be interpreted as a sign of backwardness not only by their own government and fellow citizens but also by the transnational panopticon of the developed world, protesters like Xiao Chen disciplined themselves in accordance with the standards of a global neoliberal governmentality that disdained violent protest and civil unrest. Xiao Chen's mother was even more wary of violent resistance against the Chinese state. She had worried when she learned that her daughter had joined in a protest march against the NATO bombing. Her desire to protect her daughter and the Chinese state from each other was apparent in a conversation I observed while I had dinner with them several days after the protest ended. Xiao Chen's mother warned her daughter against any action that might provoke the kind of violence that had occurred during 1989, when student protesters demanding reforms of the Chinese government had defied government orders to end their protests. Chinese leaders ordered the military to disperse the students by force, and many were killed or imprisoned on June 4, 1989, a tragedy that Chinese citizens call the \"June Fourth Incident\" (liu si shijian). 4 The developed countries' media had portrayed innocent protesters ruthlessly massacred by agents of the Chinese state, but the Chinese media had emphasized the violence inflicted by protesters against the Chinese state. Ten years after 1989, the most vivid image that Xiao Chen's mother recalled from Chinese television news coverage of the June Fourth Incident was that of protesters burning a Chinese soldier to death and mutilating the soldier's burned corpse. \"I could hardly stand to look at that,\" Xiao Chen told her daughter. \"They went too far. You must never be like them! The foreigners wanted to make China chaotic, and those students helped the foreigners make China chaotic.\"",

The Chinese media insisted that the demonstrations were expressions of the patriotic consciousness of Chinese individuals acting as free agents in a modern, democratic society, but the international media suggested that the demonstrations were performances orchestrated by an authoritarian Chinese state that controlled and manipulated its subjects. By global neoliberal standards, voluntary political consciousness was a sign of modernization and authoritarianism was a sign of backwardness (\u00d6zy\u00fcrek 2004a Paley 2001; Turner 1986 ).

Not even the foreigners are denying that they bombed our embassy. Of course the Chinese journalists are angry because they love our country, and of course the foreign journalists support their own countries, but there's no denying that the bombing happened and Chinese people were killed.\" Xin Yibin's attitude was shared by many other Chinese people with access to global information flows. A survey of 1,211 elite university students in Beijing conducted by Dingxin Zhao (2002) found little correlation between exposure to Western media sources and the degree of anger those students felt about the bombing of the Chinese embassy. Between 2003 and , when I conducted research among Chinese citizens who had left China in the early 2000s to study in Australia, Ireland, Malta, the United Kingdom, and the United States, I found that, despite their daily exposure to the perspectives of NATO countries in the media and everyday life, all of those with whom I discussed the 1999 bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade were still convinced that it had been intentional and unjustifiable. Despite their access to foreign media perspectives, these Chinese citizens favored nationalistic Chinese perspectives in line with their sense of personal loyalty to China (Fong 2004a) .",

They resented the Chinese state for failing to overcome the backwardness that allowed their nation to be victimized, but they were wary of criticizing their state in ways that could further weaken their nation. Even as they railed against the Chinese state's failure to protect them against an infringement of national sovereignty, they sought to protect their state from the instability that could result from expressions of their own anger.",

In Chinese zones of cultural intimacy, however, an alternative discourse flourished, full of amusement, vicarious triumph, and a tendency to blame the attacks on hegemonic, imperialistic U.S. policies that invited vengeance from developing countries. This discourse was kept out of the official Chinese media because it conflicted with China's efforts to join the developed world. Many Chinese citizens I knew also found this discourse embarrassing. They worried that, in addition to displaying an unseemly joy at others' suffering, this discourse suggested that Chinese citizens identified more with the developing world from which the terrorists emerged than with the developed world that stood in solidarity with the United States. Their ambivalence resembled that expressed by African American women in a discussion group for families of children with chronic medical conditions, who struggled to balance their sympathy for victims of the 9/11 attacks with critiques of the privileged assumptions underlying the dominant narrative of U.S. innocence (Mattingly et al. 2002:747) .

I observed a similar ambivalence in how people talked about a poorly publicized local tragedy that occurred a few months after NATO bombed China's Belgrade embassy. On November 24, 1999, a ferry caught fire and sank in the cold, stormy Bohai Strait on its way from Yantai (a city in Shandong Province) to Dalian. Of over 300 passengers and crew, only 22 survived. 5 The international media reported that this was the most deadly shipping disaster in the history of the People's Republic of China (News Services 1999) , but most prestigious Chinese newspapers downplayed it. On November 26, the first day the disaster was reported, the Dalian Daily included only one brief story about it (on the bottom right corner of the front page; Xinhua News Service 1999b) . As was commonly the case, the lead story that day (under the headline \"Grasp Problems, Use Real Numbers, Earnestly Improve\") reported the local government's latest interpretation of the political philosophy of then Chinese president Jiang Zemin (Liu Xing 1999) . That same day, the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's central government, placed the story of the shipwreck at the bottom of the last page of the domestic news section (Yin Jianhua and Zhang Songqing 1999) , while the stories on the front page discussed agricultural reforms in Hunan Province (Wu Xinghua 1999) , Chinese leaders' meetings with foreign leaders (Liu Shuiming and Wang Chuanbao 1999; Zhang Jingning 1999) , and how high technology boosted the development of Shenzhen City (Hu Mou 1999) . Still, the shipwreck provoked strong emotional reactions among people I knew in Dalian. They relied on rumor and conjecture to fill in the blanks of media accounts that were vague about the causes of the disaster and the details of the rescue attempts. Although the Chinese media portrayed the deaths that resulted from the disaster as inevitable casualties of natural forces, some people I knew in Dalian proposed more cynical explanations that blamed the deaths on Chinese backwardness.",

If this had happened in the West, the Air Force would have come to rescue them. In China, though, the Air Force didn't, because they were afraid that no one would pay for it. If there had been one American citizen onboard, the American president would have called the embassy and made sure the American was saved. If Jiang Zemin or Jiang Zemin's son or [then Dalian Mayor] Bo Xilai's son were on the ship, the Air Force would have been out there immediately. But since they were just ordinary Chinese people, their lives are not worth much.

Yet, for several months after it occurred, I frequently heard people in Dalian talk about the disaster in zones of conversational intimacy, and even years later I still heard it mentioned occasionally by Dalian people in relation to anger about Chinese government cover-ups or fear and disgust about the backwardness of Chinese transportation systems. I heard rumors that family members of those who died in the shipwreck threatened or participated in violence against those responsible for sending the ferry out and that they went to the port from which the ferry departed, crying, screaming, and refusing to leave until they were dragged away by police. Some of these rumors alleged that protesting family members managed to negotiate higher compensation payments than they had originally been offered; those who repeated such rumors portrayed the protesting family members as greedy, manipulative troublemakers. Other rumors alleged that protesting family members were beaten or arrested; those who spread such rumors railed against the cruelty and injustice of the state. I could not get a lot of details about these rumors, much less assess their veracity. My efforts to inquire further were often stymied when those with whom I was conversing said, \"Don't talk about it, it's no use\" and changed the subject. The shipwreck and its aftermath were widely regarded as painfully ugly and embarrassing, and my efforts to find out more about the episode were sometimes rebuffed as unseemly efforts to \"expose the ugly side of China.\" Yet this did not keep people in Dalian from frequently mentioning it to me and to each other when they wanted to express their disgust with Chinese backwardness.",

China is beautiful and modern, so you should go to China and do business, and buy snacks from peddlers!' \" \"Yes, I'll say that,\" I replied. \"But if I don't tell them about the problems as well, they'll learn about them from the other foreigners who come to China and from the Chinese who go abroad, and then they won't believe anything I say, even when I tell them that China is beautiful and modern despite the problems.\"",

In June 2003, while I was in Ireland visiting Wang Xiaoyan and Peng Huaxi (both of whom had left China in 2001 to study in Ireland), I asked whether the SARS epidemic would cause them to cancel their long-awaited plans to return to China to visit their families that summer. Wang Xiaoyan and Peng Huaxi got their information about SARS from a combination of Irish news programs, Chinese bulletin boards and news sites that they accessed through the Internet, what their Chinese and Irish friends and coworkers in Ireland told them, and what their friends and family members in China told them. In our conversation about their travel plans, they alternated between fear for their own health and the health of their families and friends in China, anger at the initial cover-up, suspicion that a cover-up was continuing, and insistence that the international media were exaggerating the dangers of SARS. They criticized the international media for their sensationalistic coverage of China's role in the epidemic and for insinuating that it spread because of Chinese backwardness, but they also criticized the Chinese media for not taking SARS seriously enough. Wang Xiaoyan was the more fearful of the two, and she mentioned numerous examples of how unsafe China could be, including the 1999 shipwreck, which she cited as a particularly egregious example of how poorly Chinese officials tended to handle disasters.",

Thousands of people were killed in America on September 11. There's no government anywhere that can protect you from everything. If you're so afraid, you might as well not go outside your door!\" Peng Huaxi's refusal to characterize China as more dangerous than other places was echoed by my friend Niu Xiaolin, a 20-year-old salesclerk living in Dalian, when I called her in March 2003 to discuss whether I should cancel my own plans to travel to China in light of the SARS epidemic. \"It's not a big deal,\" Niu Xiaolin had told me. \"The foreigners are exaggerating it. Maybe they just want to distract people from what they're doing in Iraq. Everywhere is dangerous. Aren't you afraid of terrorists? You should come to China now. China's the safest place in the world these days.\" Niu Xiaolin changed her mind in May 2003 (after the Chinese government instituted strict quarantines) and advised me that it might be too risky for me to go to China after all, but by July 2003, when the epidemic seemed to be ending, she was once again encouraging me to go to China. 6 My university's restrictions on research travel to SARS-infected areas led me to postpone my trip to China by a year, and Wang Xiaoyan also postponed her trip to China for over a year, but Peng Huaxi left Ireland for China in July 2003 and spent a month there visiting friends and family before returning to Ireland, having experienced no problems, and triumphantly boasting about the accuracy of his assessment of China's safety, with its implication of patriotism, to his more cautious Chinese friends.",

When the SARS epidemic was first beginning in March 2003, however, there had been striking differences between the unconcerned attitudes of the Chinese citizens I knew in China, most of whom had remained convinced by the Chinese media of the unimportance of SARS for over a month, and the more skeptical attitudes of the Chinese citizens I knew abroad, who had more instantaneous access to the international media's alarming coverage of the growing epidemic. When SARS first appeared, it was reported by the Chinese news media as an outbreak of atypical pneumonia (feidianxing feiyan), a dangerous but known disease, that started with a patient in Guangdong on November 16, 2002. 7 Even after Chinese officials learned how unusually deadly and contagious the disease was, they still directed the Chinese media to downplay the epidemic, which spread rapidly throughout China (Saich 2005) . Although Chinese officials hoped to prevent fear of the disease from disrupting local stability as well as global flows of business and travel, they could not keep the disease or information about it from flowing out of China. On February 21, 2003, a Chinese doctor who unknowingly carried the disease visited Hong Kong to attend a wedding reception and spread it to other travelers who then spread it throughout the world.",

As the disease became a global threat in March 2003, the international media produced increasingly alarming coverage of the SARS epidemic. The Chinese media, however, limited their coverage to occasional brief, reassuring stories that portrayed it as a small outbreak that had been contained in southern China and Hong Kong and was not unlike other respiratory disease outbreaks that usually occurred during winter (Renmin Ribao 2003a , 2003c , 2003d . Some people I knew in Dalian told me that, on the Internet, they had read less reassuring rumors and news stories about SARS written by foreigners, Chinese citizens abroad, and even Chinese citizens in China, but even they insisted to me that global fears about SARS were exaggerated, because they had not heard of anyone getting the disease in Dalian. 8 Meanwhile, the Chinese media provided heavy coverage of the U.S.-led war in Iraq (which began on March 20, 2003) just as the international media did, although the Chinese media differed from the U.S. media in that they focused first on the strength of Iraqi resistance, then on injured and dead Iraqi civilians, and, finally, on the looting and riots that resulted when Iraq's political and law enforcement infrastructure was destroyed. During this period, whenever I expressed concern about SARS during telephone calls to China, my friends there insisted that I should be more concerned about terrorist reprisals against the United States for the war in Iraq.",

Most of this information flow occurred anonymously, with the exception of a bold public campaign by retired Beijing military doctor Jiang Yanyong, who contacted and gave frank interviews to Chinese and international journalists. 9 By late April, the international news media were focusing heavily on SARS, and the Chinese government was facing demands for an open campaign against the disease from Chinese medical workers, the World Health Organization, the Chinese and international media, and governments, businesspeople, and travelers worldwide.",

The very next day, Chinese media coverage of SARS switched from muted and occasional to alarming and incessant. Chinese officials at all levels implemented aggressive measures to contain SARS, including the quarantine of suspected SARS patients and their contacts; heightened enforcement of prohibitions against spitting on the ground; the dismissal or punishment of local officials who continued trying to cover up the epidemic; the prohibition of the trade in wild animals like the civet cats, raccoon dogs, and ferret badgers that were found to be carrying the SARS virus; severe restrictions on travel; the disinfection of public areas, workplaces, and schools; the temporary closing of schools, restaurants, dance halls, movie theaters, Internet cafes, and many other workplaces; daily monitoring of individual health statuses by teachers, employers, and neighborhood committee workers; and the stationing of body-temperature checkpoints at train stations, airports, and even road entrances to cities and villages.

The maintenance of such time lags by a government that based its legitimacy on its purported role as rescuer of China from backwardness angered Chinese citizens I knew in China and abroad, most of whom were, nevertheless, reluctant to complain too much, because such time lags embodied a backwardness that could stick even to Chinese individuals who decried it. Global fears about SARS and the factors that caused it to originate in and spread from China resulted in social stigma and loss of tourism and business for Chinese citizens, not only in China but also in Chinese communities worldwide (Kleinman and Watson 2005) .

Chinese citizens were concerned that such criticisms could damage their country's reputation as a key node in global trade, tourism, and transportation networks-a reputation that they directly or indirectly depended on for their livelihoods. Yet their anger at their government's poor handling of these tragedies led them to perpetuate these criticisms, which developed lives of their own and resurfaced in conversations about other tragedies and disasters that seemed to enhance global and local perceptions of China as more backward and less safe than the developed world that Chinese citizens and leaders wanted China to join.",

During my research among families in China and among Chinese youth studying abroad, I noticed that people in a wide array of socioeconomic positions often complained to me and to each other about Chinese backwardness. This discourse highlighted their own victimization and desire for modernization, but it also embarrassed them by serving as a reminder that the backwardness they detested was an integral part of their lives and national identity. They feared that the discourse of Chinese backwardness could become a self-fulfilling prophecy, convincing foreigners and Chinese people alike that it was hopeless to try to modernize China. Backwardness could mark China as an easy target for foreign military aggression and as an unworthy contender for foreign investment, tourism, and trade.

Because most people deviate from social norms in some way, just about everyone engages in efforts to hide, deny, or defend their own deviance. Goffman focuses on deviance from local norms of gender, class, health, ethnicity, and sexual-ity. In a world in which migration and the mass media have created global social norms, however, Goffman's theory of stigma can apply to entire nations on the world stage as well as to individuals who belong to those nations. By the standards of a global neoliberal system dominated by the developed world, developing countries are stigmatized by their backwardness. I found that the public secret of Chinese backwardness was critical for understanding what was really at stake in how the Chinese citizens I knew made sense of tragic news events and, more broadly, of the world and their place in it. As Andrew Shryock notes, \"Public stages of identity display cannot be constructed, nor can they be understood, without reference to zones of cultural intimacy; yet the very publicness of these representational contexts tends to obscure such references and understandings\" (2004a:18).",

But these were the very assumptions Chinese citizens embraced in their quest to join the developed world. In a world of international migration and media discourses, those marked with the stigma of backwardness tried to hide this stigma from public gazes while simultaneously relying on it as a key for understanding the world and their place in it. Access to global information flows helped persuade many Chinese citizens that they and their nation are backward, even as participation in those flows enabled them to challenge efforts by Chinese leaders and the state-controlled Chinese media to claim that Chinese backwardness has been safely relegated to the past.",

Even as they lamented the present reality of Chinese backwardness in zones of cultural intimacy, they were also invested in the Chinese state's vision of China as a strong, modern nation that had successfully vanquished that backwardness. Their complicity resembled less the obedience of subjects who feared government repression than participation in the kind of neoliberal governmentality described by Foucault (1977 Foucault ( , 1979 Foucault ( , 1983 , in which the individual is made part of the state through regimes of knowledge, discipline, and practice rather than overt repression. But Chinese citizens were not just involved in the governmentality of the Chinese state. In an increasingly interconnected world, governmentality also worked at a global level, disciplining states as well as individuals in a regime of neoliberalism. Although the state has long mediated between its citizens and the global system, global information flows can also position citizens as mediators between the global system and the state.",

This article is based primarily on 32 months of longitudinal research (1997, 1998-2000, 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2006) in Dalian, a city in Liaoning Province, northeastern China, where I conducted participant-observation in a junior high school, a vocational high school, and a college prep high school and in the homes of 107 families that invited me to tutor their children in English or to provide them with information about going abroad. I established long-term relationships with 31 of these families and participated in their social lives, leisure time, and everyday activities. I also spent a total of 13 months (2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006) living with 16 children of the families I first met in China who were taking English classes and working at low-wage jobs in Australia, Ireland, Malta, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as they pursued opportunities for upward mobility that were unavailable in China. In addition, I surveyed, interviewed, and conducted participant-observation among 85 of their Chinese friends and roommates in these countries. All names besides those of authors whose work I cite and public figures are pseudonyms. Some of the Chinese people described in this article have been mentioned under other pseudonyms in previous publications based on my longitudinal research, but I have given them new pseudonyms in this article to avoid revealing their identities through too many cumulative details in my published work.",
