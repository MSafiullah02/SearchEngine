Before the end of February 2003, a total of 11 index cases occurred independently in 9 cities of Guangdong Province, which was the early phase of the SARS epidemic (Chinese, 2004). These index cases spread the virus to their close relatives and hospital staffs and provided the early demonstration of the respiratory transmission mode of the disease. The clinical symptoms of SARS are nonspecific. The index cases all began to have fever higher than 38\u00b0C and displayed common respiratory symptoms such as cough, headache, and shortness of breath.",

He was treated in three hospitals from January 30, 2003 to February 10, 2003 and along the way infected at least 78 other individuals including hospital staffs, patients, and close relatives and friends (Chinese, 2004). The second SSE individual, who caused the major spread of the disease out of Guangdong, was a native of Shanxi province. She went to Guangdong for business in late February and become sick while traveling. She went back to her home province and infected eight family members as well as five hospital staff members. The spread continued to Beijing when she decided to seek better treatment in Beijing (Chinese, 2004, Zhao, 2007).\n",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with the largest single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes currently known, ranging in size from 27 to nearly 32 kb in length. Coronaviruses can infect and cause disease in a broad array of avian and mammal species, including humans. The name \u201ccoronavirus\u201d is derived from the Greek word for crown, as the virus envelope appears under electron microscopy to be crowned by a characteristic ring of small bulbous structures. Within the virion, the ssRNA genome is encased in a helical nucleocapsid composed of many copies of the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The lipid bilayer envelope contains three proteins: envelope (E) and membrane (M), which coordinate virion assembly and release, and the large spike protein (S), which confers the virus\u2019s characteristic corona shape and serves as the principle mediator of host cell attachment and entry via virus- and host-specific cell receptors. The size of the SARS-CoV viral particle is approximately 80\u201390 nm and its genomic size is around 29.7 kb (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). The SARS-CoV genome contains 14 open reading frames (ORFs) flanked by 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated regions of 265 and 342 nucleotides (nt), respectively. While all CoVs carry strain-specific accessory genes in their downstream ORFs, the order of essential genes\u2014the replicase/transcriptase gene, S gene, E gene, M gene, and N are highly conserved (Graham and Baric, 2010). Similar to other known coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV genome expression starts with two long ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, which account for two thirds of the genomic capacity, followed by ORFs encoding S, E, M, and N proteins (Figure 27.1\n). In addition to these conserved core genes in coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV genome contains several accessory genes that are specific to SARS-CoV and have no homolog to known proteins. Phylogenetic analysis based on the most conserved gene ORF1b indicated that SARS-CoV is distantly related to the group 2 coronaviruses in the family Coronaviridae and represents a distinct cluster, named group 2b (Figure 27.2\n) (Snijder et al., 2003).\n",

One of the earliest and most important studies was conducted by a joint team from Hong Kong and Shenzhen in mainland China (Guan et al., 2003). In this investigation, out of 25 samples collected from market animals, SARS-CoV like viruses were isolated from 4 out of 6 masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and one raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides). Antibodies against SARS-CoV were detected in masked palm civets, raccoon dogs, and Chinese ferret-badgers (Melogale moschata). Genome sequencing indicated that the viruses isolated from civets were almost identical to those from human, suggesting a highly possible zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV from animal(s) to human (Guan et al., 2003). These data indicated that at least three different animal species were infected by a coronavirus that is closely related to SARS-CoV. This important study provided the first direct evidence that SARS-CoV existed in animals, pointing to an animal link of the SARS outbreaks.\n",

Culling of civets seemed to be effective in controlling further outbreaks in the region. However, the role of civets as a potential natural reservoir host was less evident and eventually ruled out by several studies. Serological studies indicated that only civets in the markets were infected with SARS-CoV, whereas the populations of civets in the wild or on farms are free of major infections (Tu et al., 2004, Lan et al., 2005, Poon et al., 2005). Civets produced overt clinical syndromes when experimentally infected with SARS-CoV (Wu et al., 2005). Comparative genome sequence analysis indicated that SARS-CoVs civets experience rapid ongoing mutation, suggesting that the viruses were still adapting to the host rather than persisting in equilibrium expected for viruses in their natural reservoir species (Kan et al., 2005, Song et al., 2005).",

Using serological and PCR surveillance, both groups discovered that SL-CoVs were present in different horseshoe bats in the genus Rhinolophus (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005c). While neither team was able to isolate live virus from any bat samples, the high level of viral RNA materials enabled them to determine the whole length genome sequence from several different samples. Complete genome sequence analysis revealed that bat SL-CoVs have an identical genome organization and a nucleotide sequence identity of 88\u201392% to SARS-CoV (Figure 27.1, Table 27.2\n). Except for the S, ORF3, and ORF8 gene products, all deduced amino acid (aa) sequences of the other gene products have a sequence identity above 93% with those of SARS-CoV. The variable regions between SARS-CoV and bat SL-CoV are mainly located in the coding regions for the nonstructural protein 3 (Nsp 3), S protein, ORF3, and ORF8, the products of these genes have aa sequence identity of 87\u201395%, 76\u201378%, 82\u201390%, 34\u201380%, respectively.

The most dramatic sequence difference between human SARS-CoV and bat SL-CoV is in the S protein, which has only 76\u201378% aa identity for the whole S protein and 64% aa identity if the N-terminal region (or the S1 region) was compared (Table 27.2). This observed great genetic diversity among bat SL-CoVs and the major difference between the S1 regions of SL-CoV and SARS-CoV S proteins imply that the currently identified SL-CoVs are not the direct progenitor of human SARS-CoV and continued search is required to find a bat SL-CoV that is much closely related to SARS-CoV. It can also be concluded from the earlier observations that genetic recombination may be required to bridge the gap between SL-CoV and SARS-CoV.",

It was observed that the S protein is the fastest-evolving protein of SARS-CoV during interspecies transmission from animal to human and in the following phases of human-to-human transmission. The majority of the mutations are located in the S1 domain (31 out of a total of 48 SNVs), particularly in the RBD (Chinese, 2004, Wong et al., 2004). The interaction analysis between the S proteins of different isolates and the ACE2 molecules demonstrated that two aa residues in the S protein, aa 479 and aa 487, played a key role in virus infectivity (Li et al., 2005b, Qu et al., 2005). For aa residue 479, all 2002\u20132003 human isolates and some 2003\u20132004 palm civet isolates have a codon for asparagine (N), all 2002\u20132003 and some 2003\u20132004 civet isolates have a codon for lysine (K), while some 2003\u20132004 civet isolates have a codon for arginine (R). For aa residue 487, all isolates including those from early and middle phase patient, civets of 2002\u20132003 and 2003\u20132004 have a codon for serine (S), whereas all isolates from late phase patients have a codon for threonine (T) (Figure 27.3\n). When examined using an HIV-based pseudovirus infection assay, S proteins with all combinations of residues 487/479 could efficiently use the civet ACE2 as an entry receptor but showed different infectivity in human ACE2-mediated infection (Li et al., 2005b, Qu et al., 2005). The combination of N479/T487 had the highest infectivity, N479/S487 medium infectivity, and K479/S487 the lowest, which almost abolished the infection. These results demonstrated elegantly at the molecular interface that the rapid evolution of the S protein, especially at the aa positions important for host receptor engagement, was essential for the adaptation to and establishment of an effective and productive human infection.",

As shown in Figure 27.3, there is a major sequence difference involving deletions of 17\u201318 aa right in the middle of RBM. We have since demonstrated experimentally that SL-CoV S proteins are unable to use ACE2 molecule as a functional receptor, regardless of the origin. More specifically, ACE2 from bat, civet, or human all failed to function as an entry receptor for a pseudovirus containing the SL-CoV S protein (Ren et al., 2008).

(2) Can the SARS-CoV use any bat ACE2 as a functional receptor to satisfy the precondition for bats acting as the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV or a closely related progenitor virus? In the absence of a live SL-CoV, addressing the first question is difficult, and there has been no real progress made in this area. However, recent studies in our group have provided some useful insight into the second question.",

This is also true for the bat ACE2 molecule derived from R. pearsonii (Ren et al., 2008). Recently, we have demonstrated that a 3-aa change from SHE to FYQ at aa 40\u201342 is sufficient for the R. pearsonii ACE2 to function as an entry receptor for the human SARS-CoV (Yu et al., 2010). Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that the native ACE2 molecules from other bat species, including the microbat Myotis daubentonii and the megabat Rousettus leschenaultii, were fully functional as an entry receptor for the human SARS-CoV (Yu et al., 2010; Hou et al., unpublished results). Taking together, these studies demonstrated that a subtle change in sequence was sufficient to convert a nonsusceptible horseshoe bat ACE2 into a functional receptor for SARS-CoV. Considering that there are more than 60 different horseshoe species around the world (Rossiter et al., 2007, Flanders et al., 2009), it is highly conceivable that one or more of them may serve as the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV and/or its progenitor virus(es). Moreover, the existence of functional ACE2 receptors in other bat species would suggest that the host range for SARS-CoV or SL-CoVs in bats may be much wider than originally thought.",

The story of SARS is just one of such examples that spectacularly demonstrated the seamless evolution of an animal (probably a bat) virus into a human pathogen responsible for one of the most severe global pandemic outbreaks in the modern history of mankind. In general, pathogens carried by wildlife reservoir animals usually do not cause clinical symptoms, and they lie dormant until they spill over into and cause diseases in domestic animals or humans. Classical outbreak response measures, such as those deployed during the SARS outbreaks, are still useful, but no longer sufficient for early detection and prevention of major infectious disease outbreaks in the twenty-first century.",

Surveillance of wildlife animals has also been made more feasible and productive thanks to the advance in modern molecular techniques including PCR with virus group-specific primers, virus discovery using next generation high-throughput sequencing technologies, and high-density virus microarrays (Breitbart et al., 2003, Gaynor et al., 2007, Ng et al., 2009, Yanai-Balser et al., 2010). Since the SARS outbreaks, especially after the discovery of SL-CoVs in bats, there is a significant surge in international effort for surveillance of coronaviruses in wildlife animals. Before the SARS outbreak, there were only 10 coronaviruses with complete genomes sequenced. This number has increased more than threefold as a result of the active surveillance works conducted around the world (Vijgen et al., 2005, Woo et al., 2005b, Woo et al., 2006, Woo et al., 2009a, Woo et al., 2009b, Ren et al., 2006, Vijgen et al., 2006, Alekseev et al., 2008, Lau et al., 2010, Yuan et al., 2010). Although this only marks the beginning of our understanding coronaviruses in wildlife animals, it is fair to say that we have learned a lot more about coronaviruses in general than the past 50 years or so during that period studying of viruses was only possible and called for in response to disease outbreaks. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the large number of bat coronavirus sequences available presently, it is postulated that all known disease-causing coronaviruses previously identified in human or animals originated from bat strains (Vijaykrishna et al., 2007). It is therefore likely that another outbreak could occur on a similar scale as that of the SARS-CoV outbreaks. It is our strong belief that our response to a future outbreak caused by any bat-borne coronavirus will be much more effective than what was done for the SARS outbreaks.",

It caused severe respiratory or enteric infections in affected humans and represented a new class of orthoreoviruses, which are capable of infecting and causing disease in humans. The rapid identification and characterization of Melaka virus was made possible by using exiting reagents (primers and antibodies) and knowledge (sequence and reservoir species distribution) gained from a previous surveillance study in bats, which resulted in the discovery of a bat orthoreovirus called Pulau virus (Pritchard et al., 2006). It turned out that the Melaka virus was very closely related to the Pulau virus in genetic organization of the genome segments and in antigenic cross reactivity (Chua et al., 2007). Since then, at least two other related bat have undergone cross-species transmission and caused diseases in humans (Chua et al., 2008, Cheng et al., 2009).",

One of the major lessons is that we need to pay much more attention to the reservoir species in understanding the genetic diversity of different viruses, the intricate interplay at the virus\u2013host interface and the major factors responsible for the disturbance of virus\u2013host equilibrium, which in turn trigger spillover events leading to disease outbreaks.",
