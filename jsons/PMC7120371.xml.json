However, we, and our unabated population growth, have had an increasing hand in manipulating the state of the world and that of our future. Our influence over Earth\u2019s dynamics through the millennia has contributed to the degradation of ecosystems and the exploitation of natural resources, also referred to as \u201cecosystem goods and services.\u201d Ecosystems and their goods and services\u2014food, air, water, nutrient cycling, for example\u2014are the foundation for our health and well-being. These essential functions sustain human health and, in effect, life as we know it (MEA 2005). Even subtle shifts in ecosystem services can topple this fragile equilibrium and trigger social, economic, political, and demographic changes that potentially endanger our future. Thus, the ubiquitous, ever-expanding human footprint has fuelled unprecedented resource demands that have led to the urgent need to manage and conserve our natural capital in hope of a sustainable future. For example, we \u201cconsume\u201d in one way or another as much as 40 % of all solar energy trapped by land plants (Erlich and Wilson 1991), a selfish action that not only threatens other species but that of our own (eds Grifo and Rosenthal 1997). Forests provide numerous ecosystem services that are fundamental to \u201chealth,\u201d including energy production, climate regulation, and nutrient cycling, but with the current rate of deforestation measured in acres per minute, our myopic actions defy logic, hence jeopardizing the future of this planet (Fig. 18.1).\n",

Thousands of international and local conservation organizations and scores of professional scientists excel at quantifying conservation needs in order to objectively develop science-based strategies that counter present and future threats, with the goal of balancing man and nature. Conservation organizations, constrained by their areas of expertise and financial resources, focus on protecting species and habitats in a progressively anthropogenic arena. However, delineating national park boundaries and building fences to physically separate humans and wildlife animals is a less viable tool nowadays, particularly in developing countries where there is extensive interdependence between livelihoods and ecosystem services and where resource competition is fierce. Conservationists increasingly acknowledge that the root of many conservation issues stems from conflicts over space and resources and clashes with social or cultural beliefs, the underpinnings of which may fall outside of their sphere of knowledge and influence. As a result, conservationists need to look beyond their traditional strongholds and collaborate with other sectors, including social, political, and health: conservation alone can no longer protect biodiversity.",

Projects that target wildlife ecology may overlook the opportunity to collect biological samples that could assist with management strategies, as the knowledge of baseline population health can help detect trends and identify potential new threats. Ecological studies that require animal capture, such as radio-collaring, offer a unique opportunity to collect biological samples. When pronghorn antelope were radio-collared in the Upper Green River Basin, Wyoming, to identify migration corridors (Fig. 18.2), measurements and biological samples were simultaneously collected to test for pregnancy rates and stress levels as part of a comprehensive effort to establish comprehensive baseline information about pronghorn antelope ecology (Beckmann et al. 2008). Gillespie et al. (2008) discuss multiple invasive and noninvasive sampling techniques to monitor for infectious disease and parameters of health in wild primates for both the conservation of wild animals and the safeguarding of human health. While humans and wild primates are at particular risk of epizootic and zoonotic disease due to our close evolutionary relationship, the same sampling techniques and data can be used across taxa for similar means.\n",

Through globalized air travel, an outbreak rapidly escalated and teetered on pandemic status, infecting over 8,000 people in 37 countries. However, SARS could have been detected and potentially prevented through disease surveillance in wild animals and the enforcement of policies on the illegal movement and consumption of wildlife in Southeast Asia. Three species of cave-dwelling bats were ultimately found to be the reservoir for SARS-like coronaviruses (Li et al. 2005). These animals are often sold in wet markets, and although the transmission dynamics are not clearly delineated, this virus likely infected humans through intermediary hosts like civets, which are heavily traded for food (Black 2005). While scientific laboratories and pharmaceutical companies are vying to develop vaccines, perhaps human health and conservation partners should simultaneously collaborate with governments and communities to stop the trade in wild species which would benefit all sectors? This trade not only impacts biodiversity and health but also global economies (Fig. 18.3). Increasing pressure, particularly from governments, national Ministries of Health, and multilateral agencies such as the United Nations, would add weight to flagging policies and possibly bolster national enforcement, as evidenced by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s speech to strengthen the enforcement of wildlife laws globally (Staziuso 2012).\n",

Within the parasite\u2019s complex life cycle, transmission requires appropriate habitat for the mosquito vector, such as standing water, and human activities, such as changing land-use patterns, that bring the host in contact with the vector. In many parts of tropical Asia, vast tracts of primary forests are being razed for rubber and oil palm plantations at an astonishing rate. In addition to the loss of the forests, biodiversity, and associated ecosystem services (Ziegler et al. 2009), land-use changes are likely altering disease incidence as well: rubber plantation workers may be at greater risk for contracting malaria due to increased exposure and vector proliferation (the standing water caught in sap collection cups provide habitat for mosquito larvae). The malaria researcher at the end of the microscope attributes increased disease prevalence to the trees, but in fact the true problem originates with deforestation, the conversion of forests to agricultural monocultures, and the system of rubber production. Ecosystem imbalances are largely unpredictable but seem to favor the dominance of generalist species that often become overabundant hosts or vectors (Molyneux et al. 2008). Given that expanding monoculture rubber plantations are a major threat to native forest ecosystems in parts of the world, we must consider that in this case there can be a solution that satisfies human health as well as conservation objectives.

By influencing and possibly altering disease ecology, we not only exacerbate the threat of extinction for some species but also expose the health of humans and animals to the emergence and reemergence of pathogens (Daszak et al. 2000). This interdependence is illustrated by the emergence of the Nipah virus, a lethal zoonotic paramyxovirus that killed over 100 people in an outbreak in Malaysia in the late 1990s (Daszak et al. 2013). The outbreak investigation revealed that the zoonotic pathway of the disease originated from fruit bat droppings that spilled over to humans through the infection of domestic pigs. However, both the reservoir (fruit bats) and the virus were shown to occur historically in the area, and it is likely that they have long coexisted with pig farms. Daszak and colleagues (2013) postulated that two major changes allowed the intensification of this interface upset the balance, allowing the Nipah virus to \u201cspill over\u201d into humans. According to the authors, agricultural intensification\u2014increased pig farming\u2014created a pathway for repeated transmission of the virus from fruits bats to pigs, which could also have been exacerbated by alterations in bat distribution due to forest fires and climatic oscillations. The second condition was the priming effect that the first infections had on the pig populations, allowing the animals to acquire enough immunity to sustain the virus within the population long enough to transmit it to humans, instead of just resulting in massive pig mortalities. This outbreak clearly demonstrates the consequences of toppling the fragile equilibrium between the health of ecosystems, animals, and humans.",

While the ultimate purpose of the dam was to improve human well-being through energy production, flood control, and economic stimulus, its construction altered an expanse of the Yangtze riparian system, a biodiversity hotspot. This ecological disturbance likely contributed to extinction of the Yangtze River dolphin (Lipotes vexillifer) and jeopardizes the habitat of several threatened terrestrial species, including flagship species such as the golden monkey (Cercopithecus mitis). The redistribution of water and the creation of the reservoir may also increase the incidence of waterborne diseases such as schistosomiasis and allow for the accumulation of environmental pollutants such as heavy metals, toxins, and human and animal waste. Expanded habitat for the gastropod vector of schistosomiasis and the increased exposure interface resulting from the displacement of up to four million people could cause this debilitating and infectious zoonotic parasite to proliferate. The Three Gorges Dam massively altered an important waterway and disrupted vital ecosystem under the guise of improving human livelihoods and temporary economic gain, but at what cost? Do the negative and irreversible costs to the environmental and health outweigh its short-lived benefits? Misgivings about the net benefits of the project raised by the conservation sector are not merely about the protection of charismatic species, nor do they intend to deny people the benefits of affordable electricity or flood control. Critics of the dam cite a range of issues from human rights to human health. A systematic and holistic evaluation of the project underscores what we have reiterated in this chapter from the outset: that human health and well-being derives from the health of an entire ecosystem and extreme disruptions of ecosystems jeopardize all of our well-being.",

If we continue to work within our professional \u201cbubbles,\u201d solutions will remain elusive, fragmented, and difficult to implement in a manner that addresses cross-sectoral issues such as conservation and health. From lessons learned, we should be equally conscientious when recommending treatments, interventions, and solutions for ecological disease processes such as vector-borne and waterborne disease. To approach health and disease management at the ecosystem level, we must see beyond just the end goal and consider the value of the ecosystem as a functional unit from which countless services are derived. This ecological approach to community, population, and global health requires cross-trained professionals, multidisciplinary teams, and broad-spectrum, multilateral cooperation.",

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), an infectious viral disease in wild and domestic cloven-hoofed animals, is endemic in seven out of ten Southeast Asian countries. While mortality is relatively low with this disease, morbidity impacts livestock production and national economics by limiting the growth of the livestock trade through international export. FMD-free countries will not import meat from endemic countries, and the economic losses cascade through the production chain, affecting human livelihoods. The inability of developing countries to advance their livestock production sector limits national economic growth and potential livelihood income, underscoring the direct and indirect linkages between animal and human health and well-being.",
