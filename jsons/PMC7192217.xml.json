Cigarette smoking, poor nutrition, overcrowding and other adverse external conditions, including respiratory infections, may be responsible for these differences between Aboriginal and non\u2010Aboriginal populations. No evidence of Ig deficiency or alpha\u20101 antitrypsin deficiency has been shown; in fact Ig levels tend to be higher in Aboriginal people compared with non\u2010Aboriginal Australians.\n8\n A number of studies have shown increased frequency of bacterial upper respiratory infections and lower respiratory infections in Australians of Aboriginal descent with Central Australian Aboriginal people having the highest rates of invasive pneumococcal disease,\n9\n as well as rates of Haemophilus influenzae infection.\n10\n However, there is no direct evidence concerning the potential contributions of viral and other respiratory infections to reduced lung function in Australian Aboriginal people.",

The study does not indicate that any particular organism is likely to be more detrimental than any other; a positive titre to an organism does not indicate that it is more significant than any other. Viral respiratory infections are known to be associated with subsequent bacterial infection and exacerbations of COPD,\n20\n which may be an intermediate step in a process of accelerated rate of decline in lung function, leading to irreversible airflow obstruction. However, a role for exacerbations in causing accelerated decline in other populations has not been consistently observed,\n21\n and excessive rates of decline in lung function have not been directly demonstrated in Aboriginal people in remote communities, although it is the subject of ongoing investigation in the community in which the present study was carried out. The previous demonstration of possible latent adenovirus infection in subjects with COPD\n12\n is consistent with a direct effect of viral infections on the airways, but also consistent with abnormal airways such as may result from cigarette smoking giving rise to increased susceptibility to infection with viruses and other respiratory pathogens. Additionally, Vitalis et al.\n13\n showed that latent adenovirus\u20105 infection increased the inflammatory cell response to an acute exposure to cigarette smoke in guinea pig lungs, increasing the number of macrophages and helper T cells in the airway epithelium. Recruitment of CD8+ lymphocytes in response to viral infections may cause pulmonary damage as suggested by O'Shaughnessy et al.\n22\n and Cannon et al.\n23\n Fryer and Jacoby\n24\n suggested that viral infections may decrease M2 muscarinic receptor function in airways, thereby increasing vagally mediated bronchoconstriction; the duration of this effect for acute viral infection is not known. Viral infection with rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza A and B, RSV and parainfluenza virus and infection with chlamydia have all been associated with exacerbations of asthma.\n25\n\n",

Because alcohol is prohibited in the community the effects of aspiration pneumonias and their sequelae on lung function are less likely to confound the observations of this study. The study provides evidence of a detrimental effect of respiratory infections on lung function in individuals from any Aboriginal community; this particular Aboriginal community simply provided an opportunity to examine the relationship. As the relationship between infections and lung function is likely to be similar in other communities, this study provides an important public health message regarding preventive measures.",
