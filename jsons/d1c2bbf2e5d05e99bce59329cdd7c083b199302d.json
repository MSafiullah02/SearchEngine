Macrophages constantly patrol throughout the lung, ingesting every inhaled foreign material. Macrophages in contrast to monocytes live longer due to a genetic shift toward antiapoptosis by downregulating PTEN [ 8 ] . Macrophages also express Toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR4) and CD14 and interact with SPA and CD44 to exert different functions such as release of antibacterial proteins/peptides [ 9 ] . Granulocytes interact with macrophages: if large amount of bacteria are inhaled, macrophages direct neutrophils to the site of infection, whereas small amounts of bacteria might be cleared by macrophages alone. Removal of apoptotic neutrophils requires macrophages, and this in turn decreases the infl ammatory response and neutrophil infl ux [ 4 ] . Neutrophils are able to kill many phagocytosed bacteria by producing large amounts of oxygen radicals (superoxide anions) in their lysosomes and fusing them with the phagosomes. Neutrophils are produced in the bone marrow and released from there by cytokine stimuli. Once they enter the circulation, their apoptotic program is activated. They enter the infectious site using adhesion molecules on endothelia in due time and exert their function. This is facilitated by integrins and also other adhesins. Once within the interstitium, neutrophils move along gradients of chemokines and also acidic pH.",

The lung is dark red, consistency is fi rm, and on the cut surface, there is some granularity seen, corresponding to fi brin cloths out of the alveoli (Fig. 8.1 ). In the next stage, the color of the lung changes to gray and grayish yellow. This is induced by the infl ux of leukocytes, dying of leukocytes, and release of lipid substances ( Fig. 8.2 ). The consistency of the lung is comparable to liver tissue, hence the old name \"hepatization.\" Finally in the best scenario, the exudate is reabsorbed, the alveoli are fi lled with air, and the lung changes back to normal (lysis). Most often these classical stages are not anymore seen, because pneumonia is immediately treated with antibiotics and therefore do not develop into the yellow \"hepatization\" stage but resolve out of the gray-red one. However, complications of bronchopneumonia can be seen such as abscess formation (Fig. 8.3 ) and pneumonia with infarcts due to infectious vasculitis (see below; Fig. 8.4 ). Histology and development of bronchopneumonia: Bronchopneumonia in the initial stages starts with an infl ux of macrophages from the interstitial cell pool as well as from the blood vessels (monocytoid cells; Fig. 8 .5 ). Capillaries are widened (hyperemia) and the endothelial gaps are opened. Fluid from the blood enters into the alveolar spaces (infl ammatory edema) and proteins start to coagulate (fi brin cloths). This initial stage is followed by an entry of red blood cells, which undergo lysis, contributing to fi brinogenesis. In this stage fi brin nets are seen mixed with red blood cells, scattered macrophages, and neutrophils. This corresponds to the macroscopic picture of hemorrhagic pneumonia (dark red cut surface, heavy lung, edematous fl uid rinsing from the cut surface). After 1 day dense infi ltrations by neutrophils appear, mixed with fi brin nets completely fi lling the alveolar spaces ( Fig. 8.6 ). Capillaries are still hyperemic and widened. Macroscopically the cut surface changes to a gray-red color, due to the massive infi ltration by granulocytes. Since the alveoli are completely fi lled by cells and fi brin, the consistency is similar to liver (hepatic consolidation or hepatization). Granulocytes ingesting and degrading bacteria also die because of liberation of toxic lysosomal enzymes accumulate lipids within their cytoplasm, which macroscopically gives the cut surface a yellow tone (usually by day 2-3; Fig. 8 .7 ). After 6-7 days clearance of the alveoli starts: neutrophils have degraded the bacteria, macrophages clear the debris from dying neutrophils, fi brin is lysed by the enzymes from macrophages and granulocytes, and fi nally the alveoli are fi lled by air again. Under normal condition the pneumonia resolves within 10-14 days without remnants of the infectious episode.",

In some cases the progression of the disease might be blocked by antiprotease treatment [ 19 ] . In more recent time extracorporeal oxygenation or NO treatment has shown some benefi t. If the patient survives the acute phase, DAD will be organized, which is essentially an organizing pneumonia, by some authors also labeled organizing DAD: granulation tissue grows into the alveoli and hyaline membranes are incorporated into the plugs. Remnants of hyaline membranes can be demonstrated several weeks after the initial injury (Figs. 8.11 , 8.12 , and 8.13 ) . If a tissue biopsy or an autopsy specimen is available early on in the course of the disease, the etiology might be elaborated: in viral infection inclusion bodies can be seen, which can present either as nice large inclusion bodies (CMV, RSV) or by 12 DAD in organization, this is essentially an organizing pneumonia. Hyaline membranes are still visible but organized by granulation tissue, which grows within alveoli and fi nally will fi ll the lumina red-violet stained nucleic acids forming illdefi ned speckles in nuclei and/or cytoplasm (adenovirus) [ 20 ] . This is followed by atypical proliferation and transformation of pneumocytes type II (Fig. 8.14 ) . Typically the infected cell shows enlargement, an atypical large bizarre nucleus, and an accentuated nuclear membrane due to increased nucleic acid traffi c induced by the virus. These cellular features can last for several months. In contrast to atypical pneumocyte hyperplasia (AAH), these atypical cells are singles and do not form a continuous layer along the alveolar wall. Rickettsia infection results in less pronounced proliferation of pneumocytes. In shock and drug-induced DAD, the endothelia will undergo apoptosis and necrosis, and fi brin cloths might be seen in capillaries (Fig. 8.10 ). In these cases the alveolar septa are widened and edematous. Infl ammatory cells are scarce or absent.

Also pneumocyte type II hyperplasia, edema, and infl ammatory infi ltrates were described. Clinically the symptoms were identi- cal to ARDS/AIP. The main difference stated by the author was the absence of hyaline membranes and the presence of fi brin cloths. The underlying causes were similar to classical DAD/AIP, so the author concluded that this might be a variant of DAD. However, some aspects have never been clarifi ed: Fibrin exudation and clothing is seen early in DAD (see also Fig. 8.9 ), so the earliest phase of DAD does not present with hyaline membranes -these are formed later on due to respiration, which compresses fi brin into hyaline membranes. Rarely DAD might also present with a multifocal pattern, which includes a timely heterogeneity: acute fi brinous exudation in one, organizing DAD in another area [ 22 ] . Within the underlying cause, similar diseases as in DAD were found, including rare cases of acute hypersensitivity pneumonia [ 21 , 23 ] .",

The infi ltration in LIP is more diffuse, architectural distortion is common, and scarring does occur. Histiocytic and monocytic cellular infi ltrations are much less pronounced compared to NSIP.

In early stages the infi ltration starts with macrophages and fi brin exudation followed by infi ltration by neutrophils. Abscess formation is common; cavitation is induced by some bacteria and most likely is induced by vasculitis and thrombosis. A few bacteria cause DAD and fi brinous pneumonia, other lymphocytic pneumonia -these tissue reactions can point to the underlying type of infection (Table 8 .1 ). A scattered type of neutrophilic infi ltration is seen in some infections such as Nocardia or Legionella In conditions where the fungi cannot be controlled, such as in bronchiectasis, the lung encases the infection by granulation tissue, starting as an organizing pneumonia, and later on a fi brous capsule separates the infectious focus from the normal lung -a mycetoma has been formed ( Fig. 8.21 ) . Normally there is a steady-state situation, i.e., no invasion of the fungus in deep areas of the lung occur, but the lung cannot get rid of the fungus. However, Fig. 8.19 ( a ) Purulent pneumonia due to fungal infection in a child being treated for leukemia. Note that the hyphae have already reached the blood vessels, which is a risk for developing sepsis. Although the size of the hyphae, the 45\u00b0 angle of growth, and the septation would favor an Aspergillus type of fungus, be aware that many other fungi can look alike. In ( b ) the fungus could be identifi ed as Aspergillus niger , due to the presence of conidia. H&E, \u00d7200, bar 20 \u03bcm there are rare conditions where invasion does occur and a chronic slowly progressing pneumonia develops -called chronic necrotizing mycosis. A few fungi pathogenic in humans can cause life-threatening infections: an example is mucormycosis. Again infection most often occurs in immunocompromised patients. The patients develop cough, occasionally mild hemorrhage, fever and shortness of breath is common. The major problem is that this fungus does not respond to many antifungal drugs therefore amphotericin B is applied, which has many toxic side effects. Pneumonia in Mucor infection presents with an infi ltration of macrophages and neutrophils, necrosis is widespread, pleura is often involved, or the infection can even enter the pleural cavity ( Fig. 8.22 , Table 8 .2 ).",

Some viruses such as infl uenza type A strains can destroy the basal lamina of the epithelial layer and the capillaries by their enzymes. In these cases diffuse hemorrhage is seen with bleeding from capillaries, giving the macroscopic surface of the mucosa a dark red color. The distribution of infl ammatory changes is also important: infl uenza virus usually causes trachea-broncho-pneumonia, whereas adenovirus is more likely causing bronchiolo-pneumonia. In cases of less virulent types of strains of viruses, a lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia can be seen (Figs. 8.23 , 8.24 , and 8.25 ) . As a rule one should always try to fi nd viral inclusion bodies. They can be prominent and easily seen as in CMV or HSV infection, whereas in adenovirus infection this can be diffi cult, because of intracytoplasmic bodies.

If the invader cannot be ingested and degraded by these cells, histiocytes and macrophages can form foreign body giant cells, which are more effi cient in phagocytosis and degradation. These cells together form foreign body granulomas. In every case the invading organism cannot be killed by phagocytosis, another defense line is activated, which includes immune mechanisms. This more powerful line of defense is the epithelioid cell granuloma. The driving forces, which induce granuloma formation, are the macrophages, the antigen-presenting cells, such as Langerhans and dendritic reticulum cells, and the T and B lymphocytes [ 53 -56 ] . Among the different cytokines released are interleukins 1\u03b2, 2, 3, 8, 10, 12, 17, macrophage migration inhibitory factor 1 (MIF1), IFN\u03b3, and TNF\u03b1. How these factors act and interact is still not understood; however, macrophages and lymphocytes are activated and immobilized. This is followed by the cytokine-induced transformation of macrophages into epithelioid and foreign body giant cells [ 57 -62 ] . Giant cells can be either formed by fusion of macrophages or by nuclear division without cell division. Foreign body giant cells further on differentiate into Langhans giant cells. This process of transformation is maintained by the same secretory factors, which are produced in larger quantities by the epithelioid cells and by infi ltrating lymphocytes [ 63 ] .",

Different substances either actively liberated from mycobacteria or passively by degradation can induce granuloma formation. Among them are trehalose-6,6\u2032-dimycolate, lipoarabinomannan, and 65 kDa antigen of mycobacterial capsule (a chaperonin) [ 61 , 62 ] . These products stimulate granuloma formation by the induction of cytokine gene expression, mainly IL1\u03b2 or TNF\u03b1. In addition they have other effects, like induction of apoptosis, enhancing coagulation, and together release TNF\u03b1, which subsequently induce necrosis by occlusion of small blood vessels. The mycobacterial chaperonin also stimulates monocytes to express mRNA for TNF\u03b1 and to release IL6 and IL8, cytokines which are chemoattractants for lymphocytes. In some patients necrotizing and non-necrotizing epithelioid cell granulomas, induced by M. tuberculosis , can be found side by side. The underlying mechanism is not completely understood. One possible explanation might be the mycobacterial burden: large amounts of mycobacteria release large quantities of coagulation factors and thus induce infarct-like necrosis. Another explanation is within the interaction of virulent stains of mycobacteria and host defense cells [ 63 ] .",

This type of granuloma can be induced by a variety of quite different stimuli. Epithelioid and giant cells are specialized members of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, the fi rst a differentiated secretory cell ( Fig. 8.32 ) and the second a specialized phagocytic cell ( Fig. 8.33 ). Giant cells can be either formed by cell fusion or by incomplete cell division (no cytoplasmic division). Both ways have been proven experimentally [ 56 , 64 , 65 ] . First foreign body giant cells are formed, which later reorganize into Langhans cells. These are characterized by a nuclear row opposite to the phagocytic pole of the cell. Lymphocytes are usually layered at the outer granuloma shell and can be numerous or sparse. Phenotypically these are T lymphocytes, whereas B lymphocytes are loosely arranged outside the granulomas. T-helper-1 and T-helper-2 and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8 + ) can be present in the granulomas, with the composition depending on the type of underlying disease. This will be discussed later. We can encounter different stages of granuloma formation: fi rst we see a loose aggregation of macrophages, histiocytes, lymphocytes, and even neutrophils. During each step the granuloma becomes more compact, and the margins are better circumscribed. During aging, epithelioid cell granulomas might undergo fi brosis and hyalinization (Figs. 8.34 , 8.35 , and 8.36 ) . However, in some diseases like extrinsic allergic alveolitis, the epithelioid cell granulomas remain less well delineated and tend to be more loosely arranged. Also a spillover of lymphocytes into adjacent alveolar septa is seen.",

In recent years a rise of syphilis is seen in Asian and South American countries, and new cases appear in Europe due to \"sex tourism.\" In most instances it might be diffi cult to get the proper information from the patients. The primary infection sites are the external genitalia, where a granulomatous and ulcerating infl ammation starts. After bacteremia the organisms can enter the lungs. Infl ammation is characterized by necrotizing epithelioid cell granulomas with numerous neutrophils within the central necrosis (Figs. 8.47 , 8.48 , and 8.49 ). Vasculitis is commonly seen in this granulomas causing vascular obstruction. The name gumma, used for these granulomas, is derived from their macroscopic appearance: the central necrosis is not caseous as in tuberculosis but has a gumlike consistency, hence the name (gummi arabicum). The Treponema organisms can be stained by silver impregnation (modifi ed Warthin-Starry stain, Fig. 8 .50 ) or immunohistochemically by specifi c antibodies.",

Neither mycobacteria nor propionibacteria could be cultured directly from the granulomas. So how to interpret this? Is the fi nding of bacterial DNA in sarcoidosis granulomas incidental? Could it be causative for It has been speculated that cell wall-defi cient mycobacteria, unable to grow, might induce sarcoidosis. We have shown that in some cases, DNA insertion sequences, characteristic for M. avium , could be amplifi ed from granulomas. In three cases of recurrent sarcoidosis in lung transplants, mycobacterial DNA other than tuberculosis complex could be found [ 84 ] . Other recent reports have demonstrated that naked mycobacterial DNA is capable of inducing a strong immune response [ 85 -87 ] . And it is known that mycobacteria can preferentially persist in macrophages. In a working hypothesis, we assume that slow-growing members of mycobacteria might elicit an allergic reaction, in the background of a host's hyperergic predisposition. Via circulation these allergens could be distributed to different organ systems, elicit-ing the well-known perivascular granulomatous reaction.",

In sarcoidosis patients with active disease, proliferation pathways involving the phosphoinositol-3-kinase-Akt2 pathway, including Src kinase, and crk-oncogene, as well as fatty acid-binding proteins 4 and 5 together with PPAR\u03b2\u03b4, induce proliferation of macrophages and lymphocytes of Th1 lineage. In addition the apoptosis pathway is downregulated by protein 14-3-3. So probably the underlying defect in sarcoidosis might be a prolonged proliferation of lymphocytes and macrophages and a longer survival of these activated cells, which then causes disease [ 88 ] . The mechanism by which mycobacteria or propionibacteria can trigger this inflammatory reaction is still unclear, but the answer might be found in the mechanisms of antigen processing and presentation. Other theories are focusing on polymorphisms of different genes such as TNF\u03b2 and HSP70 [ 89 ] . A lot of research has focused on polymorphisms within the HLA system. HLADRB1*0301/ DQB1*0201 has been linked to good prognosis and Lofgren syndrome; a linkage study found genetic alterations on chromosome 5 in African American sarcoidosis patients, whereas another linkage to chromosome 6 (identified as BTNL2 gene) was found in a German population [ 90 ] . Finally studies have focused on the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, which are responsible for the processing of antigens and also dictate the type of immune reactions. Modifications within the TLR4 might be associated with the susceptibility for sarcoidosis [ 91 ] .",

The granulomas tend to be larger than in EAA/HP or sarcoidosis; however, it is impossible to differentiate them morphologically from sarcoidosis. The granuloma itself is identical to the granuloma in sarcoidosis (Fig. 8.71 ). As in sarcoidosis no infectious organisms can be demonstrated in the granulomas. No larger series of BAL have been reported in berylliosis so far. However, in an experimental investigation, a predominance of T-helper lymphocytes has been reported, making BAL an unsuitable tool for the differentiation of berylliosis and sarcoidosis. For the diagnosis a lymphocyte transformation test is usually recommended, and an exposure history is necessary. The exact cause of berylliosis is still unclear. Beryllium oxide is a molecule, too small to induce an allergic reaction. Berylliumprotein complexes most probable induce this reaction. Beryllium might form tetrameric complexes with amino acids and alter the tertiary structure of proteins, subsequently eliciting an allergic reaction [ 92 , 93 ] . A genetic predisposition for chronic allergic berylliosis has been proven [ 94 ] , and recently tetramers of beryllium-loaded HLADP2-mimotope and HLADP2plexin A4 have been detected in patients. This tetramers bind specifi cally to CD4 + T cells and might elicit the allergic reaction [ 95 ] . By electron microscopy and EDAX analysis, beryllium oxide can be proven in the granulomas. It should be reminded that in routinely processed specimen, the beryllium oxide is often leached out from the tissue by the solvents used for fi xation, dehydration, and embedding.

In open lung biopsies, epithelioid cell granulomas are frequently seen in EAA/HP, whereas they are quite rare in transbronchial biopsies. This might be a technical and distribution phenomenon: whereas granulomas in sarcoidosis are easily found in the bronchial mucosa, in EAA/HP the granulomas are more frequent in the periphery of the lung, usually distributed along small blood vessels (venules, capillaries; Fig. 8.72 ). Granulomas are, however, not the diagnostic requirement of EAA/ HP: a dense lymphocytic interstitial infi ltration centered upon small blood vessels alone raises the differential diagnosis of EAA/HP (Fig. 8.72a ) . As in sarcoidosis all special stains for infectious organisms are negative. In contrast to sarcoidosis, the granulomas in EAA/ HP are more loosely organized; they have usually a broader rim of lymphocytes, and the lymphocytic infi ltration spills over into the adjacent alveolar septa. In active disease there may be a lymphocytic interstitial infi ltration with or without lymph follicle hyperplasia. Very helpful is the BAL: in EAA/HP there is a lymphocytic alveolitis with a predominance of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8 + , CD11a + ). The CD4/CD8 ratio should be <0.8. However, it should be mentioned that a few exceptions to this rule have been reported. There is also a time effect: under antigen restriction the helper-suppressor ratio normalizes within a week and in some cases may even become >1.0 within a few days (unpublished personal observations).",

Therefore she removed LIP and GIP, because an etiology could be assigned to them. The original BIP was renamed into bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia (BOOP) [ 107 ] , a term which was long before known as \"pneumonia with carnifi cation\" (karnifi zierende Pneumonie) in the German literature.

If our diagnostic capabilities can be refi ned, it might be reasonable that the disease could be diagnosed in a younger-aged group, since we know from the pathogenesis that fi brosis starts much earlier.",

            "text": "The cause and the etiology of IPF/UIP are not well understood. There is a working hypothesis, which can explain some of the features. The disease starts with an as yet unidentifi ed epithelial injury causing apoptosis of pneumocytes [ 119 -122 ] . Infl ammatory signals released by the dying pneumocytes cause transformation and proliferation of fi broblasts and myofi broblasts in a myxoid stroma and repair [ 123 ] (so-called fi broblastic focus). Genetic abnormalities may underlie these apoptotic response: in the recent years, research in familial forms of IPF has highlighted the importance of surfactant apoproteins in maintaining a homeostasis between injury and repair and that mutations in the surfactant apoprotein C gene might be causally related to the development of familial IPF [ 124 ] . In these familial IPF, mutations in genes encoding surfactant apoprotein C and A2 increase endoplasmic stress reactions in pneumocytes type II, and in addition mutations in the telomerase genes TERT and TERC are responsible for telomere shortening probably decreasing the pool of peripheral lung stem cells and thus impairing repair and regeneration [ 125 ] . This later defects are also found in sporadic IPF cases. Therefore inhalation of any kind of toxic material from the environment might cause an overwhelming oxidative stress reaction leading to increased apoptosis of pneumocytes and impaired regeneration [ 126 ] . This fi ts quite well into the epidemiology of IPF patients: the majority are smokers; some have a history of environmental dust exposure [ 127 , 128 ] . There is also evidence of epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) of pneumocytes into myofi broblasts, but also scattered bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells seem to move into these foci [ 129 -131 ] (Fig. 8.89 ). These foci undergo maturation with collagen deposition, and fi nally the process results in fi brosis of alveolar septa and bronchiolar walls [ 121 ] . This in turn causes obstruction of the terminal airways resulting in cystic destruction of the remaining peripheral lobules, giving rise to honeycombing and remodeling of the lung parenchyma [ 122 , 132 , 133 ] . Recently additional mutations have been identifi ed in IPF: a mutation of MUC5B gene promoter was shown to be associated with risk for IPF and also fi brosing NSIP [ 134 ] , and another gene mutation in dyskerin (DKC1) was associated with familial IPF [ 135 ] . Whereas the function of MUC5B is not explored, dyskerin cooperates with hTERT and thus may be another variant of this complex scenario. IPF develops stepwise, which means there are lung lobules not affected yet looking normal, whereas others are destroyed or even completely lost to fi brosis and scarring. This is meant by the term \"timely heterogeneity\" (Fig. 8.90 ).",

Given the differences in resolution between HRCT and histology, there is a substantial difference in size between the two. Pathologically a so-called honeycomb lesion is a cystic lung lesion involving a secondary lobule.

The lung architecture is preserved in contrast to UIP, and cystic destruction is absent. Two forms are discerned, which in some cases might represent timely sequences of the disease: the cellular and fi brotic type (Figs. 8.104 , 8.105 , 8.106 , and 8.107 ). Both behave different; the cellular type has a better prognosis, whereas the fi brotic variant is more close to UIP [ 110 ] . In the etiologic background, NSIP is most often associated with autoimmune diseases, especially with collagen vascular diseases [ 28 , 144 -147 ]. An association with drug-induced pneumonia and also with allergic diseases such as extrinsic allergic alveolitis/hypersensitivity pneumonia (EAA/HP) has also been reported [ 148 , 149 ] . Only those cases without an identifi able etiology are labeled as idiopathic NSIP. However, the morphologic pattern is identical; therefore in most instances, idiopathic NSIP remains a clinical diagnosis. There are some exceptions: in cases where additional features such as epithelioid cell granulomas are identifi ed, this will favor EAA/HP; an additional pathology of endothelia could point to drug-induced disease. Clinically NSIP shows diffuse infi ltrations, corresponding to ground glass opacities on HRCT. Symptoms as in the other interstitial lung diseases are quite unspecifi c. Many patients with NSIP will respond to corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive drug treatment, but also spontaneous resolution of the disease has been reported [ 150 , 151 ] . So far no genetic factors leading to NSIP have been identifi ed.",

In rare cases the consolidation can mimic a tumor [ 153 ] . Histologically the hallmark of OP is an intra-alveolar granulation tissue, the so-called Masson body ( Fig. 8.109 ). It consists of proliferating fi broblasts and myofi broblasts with infl ammatory cells like neutrophils, lymphocytes, histiocytes, and macrophages. Hemosiderin-laden macrophages are often present. The granulation tissue can start from the wall of bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. There is usually a defect of the epithelial layer and also the basal lamina. Fibroblasts and myofi broblasts grow into the defect; however, in contrast to normal repair, the granulation tissue does not stop but continuously grows into the airspaces, fi lling these completely or incompletely. In later stages pneumocytes will grow over these granulation tissue plugs and therefore a slit-like airspace can be formed (Fig. 8.110 ) [ 153 ] . The amount of infl ammatory cells within the granulation tissue depends on the cause of OP. The morphologic pattern of organizing pneumonia (OP) has a very wide range of etiologies (Table 8 .9 ). In some cases of OP, the etiologic cause can be determined, for example, by hyaline membranes in DAD or by viral inclusion bodies in post-viral OP or by endothelial cell reactions in drug-induced OP. In some cases an additional pathologic tissue reaction besides OP can also point to the underlying etiology. If looking for the etiology, one should also closely investigate the small blood vessels and the regenerating pneumocytes: viral inclusion bodies might be still visible, scattered neutrophilic granulocytes can be found in the granulation tissue in cases of bacterial or fungal infection, and eosinophils might be seen pointing to a previous druginduced pneumonia. In virus-induced pneumonias another feature can be found, even after several months: single transformed pneumocytes showing atypical nuclei and a homogenously stained smudged chromatin pattern Fig. 8.108 CT scan of a patient with organizing pneumonia. The reticulonodular pattern and the tree-in-bud pattern are nicely shown. There are also some nodular densities in the peripheral lung and ground glass opacities ( Fig. 8.111 ). In drug-induced and metabolic as well as in autoimmune diseases, the vascular walls can show various structural changes making an etiology-based diagnosis probable: eccentric vasculopathy with scattered lymphocytes and without endothelial damage might point to deposition of idiotypic-anti-idiotypic immune complexes (without complement activation; Fig. 8 .112 ) and endothelial damage with fi brosis and repair can point toward druginduced damage (Fig. 8.113 ).",

H&E, bar 20 \u03bcm pseudostratifi ed squamous-looking epithelium can be present. The cyst walls are fi brotic and often merge with scarred lung tissue or large fi brotic areas involving sometimes a subsegment of the lung. Within the lumen mucus can accumulate, and in late stage this can be the starting point for secondary infection and bronchopneumonia causing death of the patient (Figs. 8.95 and 8.96 ). I prefer the term lobular cystic lung remodeling (LCR) instead of honeycombing, because of the size differences between HRCT and microscopy. The areas of fi brosis and scarring and the uninvolved lung tissue ( heterogeneity ) do not need an explanation. But what about infl ammation? From what we understand presently, IPF/UIP is not an immune-driven or classic infl ammatory disease. Therefore we do not expect infl ammatory cells within the myofi broblastic foci. If lymphocytes appear in numbers (>10/ HPF) within a myofi broblast focus, this should raise the possibility of an underlying immune reaction (Figs. 8.97 and 8.98 ). The appearance of granulocytes within these foci should prompt the search of remnants of hyaline membranes, because this may represent organizing DAD. The ATS/ERS recommends that a panel of experts composed of pulmonologists, radiologists, and pathologists (CRP) should make the diagnosis of IPF. The clinical presentation and course, the HRCT picture, and the pathologic pattern of UIP should be combined. Five categories of confidence of IPF diagnosis can be reached: Fig. 8.96 Cystic remodeling of alveolar tissue, here the cysts are fi lled with cellular debris, macrophages, and scattered neutrophils.
