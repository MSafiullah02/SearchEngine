All positive cases so identified at facilities outside the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health (MoH) require confirmation at MoH laboratories. To identify patients for inclusion in this study, we reviewed available line lists of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported by the MoH to the World Health Organization (WHO) from November 2012 to February 2016. Records meeting these criteria were reviewed, and information was collected regarding patient demographics, medical history, prenatal course, maternal and newborn hospital course, and outcome. When necessary, we attempted to contact patients or proxies by telephone to supply missing information, such as infant outcomes. This investigation was part of an emergency public health response and was determined to be nonresearch by the MoH and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and therefore not subject to institutional review board review.",

Physiologic changes occur during pregnancy to reduce inflammatory immune responses that otherwise might lead to fetal rejection [10]. Disease pathogenesis is also affected, secondary to the reduced activity of natural killer cells, inflammatory macrophages, and helper T cells [10]. In addition, mechanical and biochemical factors affect gas exchange and pulmonary function during pregnancy; functional residual capacity and residual volume are both decreased in pregnancy [11].",
