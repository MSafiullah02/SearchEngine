All of these outbreaks have been proven to be associated with the airflow patterns in indoor environments [5]. An infected person can exhale particles carrying pathogens through the activities of breathing, coughing, talking, and sneezing, which are transient in nature. These particles can cause the transmission of infectious diseases to other occupants in the same enclosed environment [6], [7]. Hence, it is essential to predict transient particle transport in the enclosed environment in order to improve air distribution design and reduce the risk of infection.",

            "text": "As a powerful airflow and contaminant modeling tool, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been widely used in predicting transient particle transport in enclosed environments. For particle modeling, the Eulerian and Lagrangian methods are popular. For instance, Li et al. [8], Seepana and Lai [9], and Chen et al. [10] studied the effects of ventilation parameters on person-to-person particle transport using an Eulerian drift flux model. Li et al. [11] and Chen et al. [12] investigated the effectiveness of covering a cough on reducing the receptor's exposure using an Eulerian method. Hang et al. [13] used an Eulerian model to assess the influence of human walking on the transmission of airborne infectious diseases in a six-bed isolation room. Chen et al. [14], Gao et al. [15], and Zhang and Li [16] applied the RNG k-\u03b5 model with a Lagrangian method to calculate the transport of exhaled droplets in a dental clinic, an office, and a fully-occupied high-speed rail cabin. Zhang and Chen [17] compared the Eulerian and Lagrangian methods for predicting transient particle transport from a cough in a four-row aircraft cabin. Wang et al. [18] systematically compared the Eulerian and Lagrangian methods with various turbulence models and found that the Eulerian method was faster than the Lagrangian method. Both the Eulerian and Lagrangian methods can provide detailed information about transient particle concentration distributions. However, even with the Eulerian method, the unsteady-state calculation with iterations in each time step is considerably time-consuming. For instance, Wang et al. [18] reported that the computing times of the Eulerian and Lagrangian methods for calculating transient particle transport in a typical room were 62.2 and 84.9 h, respectively, on an eight-core cluster with two 2.5 GHz AMD quad-core processors.",

For instance, Nicas [19] and Jones and Nicas [20], [21] applied the Markov chain technique in a multi-zone model. However, this model does not inform users about particle movements between zones with respect to the required input values. Chen et al. [22] further used the CFD approach with Lagrangian particle tracking to obtain such information in order to complete the method. Since Lagrangian particle tracking is highly time-consuming, this method is suitable only for an extremely coarse grid. Therefore, a new model that not only works on a fine grid, as do the Eulerian and Lagrangian methods, but also runs faster than these two methods, is desirable. This investigation aimed to develop a Markov chain model for quickly predicting detailed transient particle concentration distributions in enclosed environments.",

This study estimated the turbulent fluctuating airflow rate from cell i to the neighboring cell as:(15)Qfluctuating,i,nb=\u03b1i,nb2ki/3\u00b7Ai,nbwhere Ai,nb is the area of the connecting face between cell i and the neighboring cell The coefficient \u03b1i,nb is calculated by:(16)\u03b1i,nb=2\u00b7(1\u2212\u03a6(\u0394si,nb/\u0394t2ki/3))where \u0394si,nb is the distance between the centroid of cell i and that of the neighboring cell.

The coefficient \u03b1i,nb considers the effects of the distance between the cell centroids and the time step size on the turbulent dispersion of particles. For instance, when the distance between the cell centroids, \u0394si,nb, is extremely small, its effect is negligible, and the coefficient \u03b1i,nb should be equal to 1. However, when the distance between the cell centroids is extremely large, a particle originally at the center of the cell has almost no chance of moving to the neighboring cell in one time step, and the coefficient should be equal to 0.",

All the particle concentrations were normalized by the concentration at the source. The Markov chain model and experimental data display similar particle concentration profiles at the locations with heights of 1.7 and 1.4 m. At the location with a height of 1.1 m, the peak in the particle concentration was delayed in comparison with the peaks at the 1.7 and 1.4 m locations, and this delay was correctly captured by the Markov chain model. Furthermore, the model correctly predicted much lower particle concentrations (almost zero) at the location with a height of 0.2 and 0.6 m than at the other locations. To keep this paper concise, the results at these two locations are not presented here. Generally speaking, the trends in the normalized particle concentration distributions predicted by the Markov chain model again agreed reasonably well with the experimental data.",

A particle size of 1 \u03bcm was assumed in order to represent fine particles.

All three models show that the exhaled particles initially moved upward with the thermal plume generated by the index person. The particles then dispersed throughout the room and reached the receptor. It can be seen in Fig. 6 that the Markov chain and Lagrangian models both predicted slower particle dispersion than did the Eulerian model. Note that both the Markov chain and Lagrangian models use the principle of the random walk model (Eq. (14)) to calculate the turbulent diffusion, while the Eulerian model includes the turbulent diffusion term in the particle governing equation. The numerical diffusion introduced by the Eulerian model may be an important reason for its more dispersive characteristics. Generally speaking, the trends in transient particle transport predicted by the Markov chain model agree well with both the Largangian and Eulerian models. For the calculation as a whole in this case, the Markov chain model was 8.0 times faster than the Lagrangian model and 6.3 times faster than the Eulerian model.",

For instance, some sources could change the airflow pattern, such as a powerful cough or sneeze from an uncovered mouth. In these cases, the probability transition matrix would also change. Therefore, the Markov chain model developed in this study is suitable only for those scenarios in which the mouth is effectively covered or the influence of the exhaled air is negligible. In the future, we intend to develop an improved Markov chain model for transient particle transport under unsteady-state airflow conditions. Note that, when combining with the superimposition method, the Markov chain model can also be used for predicting steady-state particle concentrations with a continuous source. However, when compared with the steady-state Eulerian model, the Markov chain model is more time-consuming because it needs to be performed under a transient condition. Therefore, the Markov chain model is not superior for steady-state particle concentration predictions.",

For particles with a diameter smaller than 3 \u03bcm, as were used in this study, these are the only important mechanisms in typical indoor environments [30]. If only these two mechanisms are considered, this model can also be used for tracer gas simulations. However, for particle transport, there are other mechanisms, such as gravitational settling, thermophoresis, particle fluctuation due to turbulence, and particle acceleration. Zhao et al. [30] indicated that gravitational settling could significantly affect the particle concentration distribution for particles with a diameter larger than 5 \u03bcm. Thus, to model the transient transport of coarse particles, the effect of gravitational settling should be further considered. Furthermore, for coarse and ultrafine particles in a room with a low air change rate, the influence of particle deposition on the particle concentration distribution may be considerable. Therefore, the implementation of particle deposition into the current Markov chain model deserves further study.",
