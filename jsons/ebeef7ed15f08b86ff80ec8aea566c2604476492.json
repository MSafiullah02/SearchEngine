The potential to cause life-threatening respiratory failure and rapid transmission puts COVID-19 in the list of Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). In the last two decades, this is the 3 rd deadliest Coronavirus China. SARS-CoV-2 is suspected to be zoonotic in nature as genetic studies have shown sequence similarity to viruses originating from bats. Extreme precautionary measures, such as curfew, shutting of borders and quarantining of individuals suspected to be infected have been instituted with immediate effect; however, due to individuals that are asymptomatic, uncontrolled humanto-human transmission has resulted in exponential infection rate and numerous loss of lives even with this lockdown measures. This review article summarizes the developing situation surrounding the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with respect to its epidemiology, unique genomic structure, possible origins, transmission, pathogenesis, comparison with other deadly species of Coronaviruses (CoV) and emerging treatment strategies built on informed literature.",

Formerly, six Coronaviruses have been recognized as causative agent for infection in humans. Among them, the \u03b1-CoV strains (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and \u03b2-CoV strains (HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43) possess low infectivity and produce only mild respiratory infection akin to the common cold. The two much known \u03b2-CoV of which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV belong, can cause severe and possibly life-threatening respiratory infection (Yin and Wunderink, 2018) . It is confirmed that 96.2% of the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is identical to bat CoV RaTG13. Earlier reports have documented this also in Rhinolophus affinis, Bat-SL-CoVZC21 and then Bat-SL-CoVZC45, which indicates a common ancestry and that the SARS-CoV-2 originated from Chinese chrysanthemum bat. The virus also shares 79.5% of the genome sequence with SARS-CoV. Based on available evidence of genome sequencing and evolutionary analysis, bat has been suggested as the natural reservoir and origin of the SARS-CoV-2. Bats may transmit the virus to humans via anonymous intermediate hosts (Guo et al., 2020) .",

Later, a huge number of COVID-19 patients who supposedly did not have prior association with the wet animal wholesale and seafood markets were reported, indicating the development of human-tohuman or communal spread (Chan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020a; Lu et al., 2020b; Nishiura et al., 2020) . The SARS-CoV-2 is appeared to be disseminated among humans through respiratory droplets while coughing and/or sneezing. Transmission through droplet can take place when a COVID-19 person coughs or sneezes, as a result of which SARS-CoV-2 containing droplets are pushed up to 3 feet (Guo et al., 2020). These droplets then can be collected at the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose or mouth of the adjacent person. A recent study reported that ocular surface does have the potential to carry SARS-CoV-2 and therefore can transmit the infection (Lu et al., 2020a) . Other means of SARS-CoV-2 spread include handshaking with infected person, contact with an object/surface containing virus, repeated touching of the face (eyes, nose or mouth) or exposure to excreta of infected patient. Another recently confirmed mode of transmission is \"hidden transmission\", defined as the unintentional spread of SARS-CoV-2 by asymptomatic virus carriers to close contacts (Chan et al., 2020).",

The clinical presentation of COVID-19 is highly variable and may not manifest as in asymptomatic virus carrier, a form with Acute Respiratory Disease (ARD) and typical pneumonia of protean severity. Earlier reports suggest that asymptomatic patients whom show no symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, cough and sneezing, and no chest radiograph abnormalities were spotted through positive viral nucleic acid testing (Bai et al., 2020; Team, 2020) . The person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 by asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers has been widely documented in the literature (Bai et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Rothe et al., 2020) . In contrast, laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 patients had respiratory symptoms of ARD; nonetheless, their chest computed tomography (CT) was not remarkable for pneumonia signs (Guan et al., 2020) . Finally, COVID-19 patients with pneumonia presented with both respiratory symptoms and chest abnormalities consistent with pneumonia. This class is indicative of severe pneumonia (respiratory rate \u226530/minute, PaO2/FiO2 \u2264300 mmHg, or SpO2 \u226493%, and a grave respiratory complication such as respiratory failure needing mechanical ventilation, shock, or permanent end-organ damage necessitating management in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (Team, 2020) .",

For instance, it was demonstrated that 50.5% of COVID-19 patients had chronic health conditions, which included cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases .

Besides, COVID-19 severity were significantly associated with presence of coexisting diseases in comparison with those having non-severe COVID-19 (37.6% versus 20.5%, P < 0.001) (Guan et al., 2020) . In agreement with this, other reports also stated similar trend in their study of 138 COVID-19 patients.

The secondary dissemination of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV arose mostly in the hospital environment and so did with SARS-CoV-2. One report suggested that 1716 cases of COVID-19 transmission among healthcare personnel, of which 5 deaths were informed (Team, 2020) . However, unlike SARS and MERS infection, COVID-19 patients biochemically present with elevated viral loads, even when asymptomatic (Holshue et al., 2020) . Similar, findings were also observed for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who visited Wuhan, United States, Germany and other countries (Wang et al., 2020d) .",

Current therapeutic options mostly focused on symptomatic and supportive management of COVID-19 as per recent guidelines (Jin et al., 2020) . All patients receive oxygen therapy and WHO endorses extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to COVID-19 cases presenting with refractory hypoxemia (WHO, 2020a) . Also, plasma and immunoglobulin G showed promising results in treating severe cases . As far as antiviral treatment strategy is concerned, several studies have shown promising results. A study demonstrated Remdesivir to be effective in treating the first COVID-19 case in the United States (Holshue et al., 2020) . Another study proved Remdesivir and Chloroquine combination to be effective in antagonizing the in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2 . A systematic review also attested the effectiveness of Chloroquine in COVID-19. The study comprehensively listed clinical trials at various stages assessing the potential role of Chloroquine in COIVD-19. However, high-end clinical trials are still needed for safe clinical implementation (Cortegiani et al., 2020) . According to one report from WHO, nearly 500 clinical trials are being conducted to explore for therapeutic options in China, of which 13 are assessing the efficacy of Chloroquine in COVID-19 (WHO, 2020e). A report from South Korea showed significantly reduced SAR-CoV-2 viral loads in COVID-19 patient upon administration of Lopinavir/Ritonavir treatment (Lim et al., 2020) . Passive immunization is one of the elapsed immunological treatment entities. Earlier, a meta-analysis on use of convalescent plasma for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection has shown encouraging results (Mair-Jenkins et al., 2015) . In particular, administration of convalescent plasma, obtained from recovered COVID-19-infected patients, showed promising results in treating patients with clinical complication related to the infection .",

The latest WHO figures for the number of people with SARS-CoV-2 internationally might be an underestimation given the fact that many of the cases with mild symptoms may go unnoticed, while circulating the virus at the same time. The WHO has labeled SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic and as a result, international government organizations have naturally been tasked to ramp up safety measures to dampen both imported cases and local transmission, ever mindful of \"at-risk\" groups. Each and every country, at their own level, is leaving no stone unturned to thoroughly test for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The underlined pointers are the collective summary of steps taken across the globe to counter the spread of SARS-CoV-2. These include hand washing with soap or an alcohol-based hand rub, regularly disinfecting surfaces with 70% Ethyl Alcohol or 0.5% bleach solution, refraining from touching your eyes, nose and mouth with soiled hands, exercising respiratory hygiene such as coughing or sneezing into a bent elbow or tissue, disposing contaminated tissue immediately, wearing medical or surgical mask for individuals with respiratory symptoms, performing hand hygiene after disposing off medical or surgical mask, self-quarantining of individuals with respiratory symptoms, avoiding close contact in large gatherings and maintaining a person-to-person distance of 6.5 feet, drinking plenty of water, avoiding smoking, travel screening, worldwide travel ban, closure of educational institutions, working from home wherever possible and remaining abreast of the developing situation regarding SARS-CoV-2.",

Individuals that are elderly, immunocompromized or with existing health conditions are more likely to contract SARS-CoV-2. While China might have reached the plateau with regards to incidence of new COVID-19 cases, other countries are still struggling to flatten the curve of reported cases and in fact, numbers of cases and fatalities have surpassed that of China. Till date, no effective therapy is available except for supportive disease management. However, the similarity of genomic sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and MERS might assist in development of novel treatments. Presently, concerted efforts to promote and exercise infection control and other established measures such as social distancing are the only tactic adopted to slow the spread of this highly communicable virus.

Globally and as of April 1 st 2020, COVID-19 has affected 924,688 individuals in over 200 countries, causing 46,368 fatalities. While the SARS-CoV-2 originated in China with over 82,724 confirmed cases and more than 3000 deaths as at the time of writing this review, the rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in exponential increase in the number of cases outside of China to about 10 times the report case and death in mainland",

Coronaviruses' genomes possess highly variable open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF (ORF1a/b) contains two-thirds of RNA and encodes two polyproteins; pp1a and pp1ab, and also translates 16 non-structural proteins (NSP). On the other hand, the residual ORFs codes for structural and accessory proteins. The remaining of the genome translates four critical structural proteins, which are small envelope (E) protein, matrix (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein and spike (S) glycoprotein, including a number of accessory proteins that suppress host's innate immune response (Cui et al., 2019)(Fig. 4). A study byWu et al (2020) lately conducted in-depth meta-transcriptomic sequencing analysis on WHCV, which revealed 16 NSP(Wu et al., 2020a). The WHCV also shows certain phylogenetic and genomic resemblance toSARS-CoV, predominantly  in the gene encoding the Sglycoprotein and receptor-binding domain (RBD), signifying their competence for human-tohuman transmission. With regards to the whole genome sequencing, SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the SARS-like bat Coronaviruses in contrast to the known genomes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which are of non-bat ancestry. In addition, most of the encoded proteins by genome of SARS-CoV-2 are comparable to SARS-CoV, however, few variances also exist. From proteomics perspective, no substitutions of amino acid were present in envelope, NSP7, NSP13, matrix, or other accessory proteins such as p6 and 8b, excluding spike protein, NSP2 and NSP3 (Wu et al., 2020a). Angeletti et al (2019) highlighted that NSP2 and NSP3 mutation might play an important role in infective potential and viral differentiation processes of SARS-CoV-2. This drove scientists to probe the host tropism and transmission differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and carry out more research to identify the possible drug targets (Angeletti et al., 2020). Zhang et al (2020) also found mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome of different patients from several provinces of China (Zhang et al., 2020a). Tang et al (2020) performed population-based genetic analyses on 103 genomes of SARS-CoV-2. They categorized two common types; L type (~ 70%)",

MERS (MERS-CoV) was also found to emerge through zoonosis from bats through dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.Interestingly, symptoms of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frequently manifest as high grade fever, cough and sneezing, and subsequently severe respiratory tract infection with poor prognosis for the elderly, immunocompromised and individuals with underlying comorbidities.The diagnosis is established via the RNA testing of sputum and throat swab samples.The WHO affirmed that the outbreak of SARS ceased on 5 th of July 2003. A total number of 8096 SARS morbidities and 774 mortalities across 29 nations were published with case-fatality rate of 9.6%. MERS is yet to halt and has so far infected 2494 individuals and claimed 858 lives across 27 nations with case-fatality rate of 34.4%. While SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV had significantly high case-fatality rate, SARS-CoV-2 has done more damage in terms of mortality. This could be explained by high number of documented and undocumented cases. In this regard, Li et al",
