Influenza viruses cause more or less respiratory diseases [1]. Influenza viruses are group into Type A and Type B. The viruses are often transmitted from people and cause seasonal influenza epidemics each year. The evolving prevalence of infectious diseases is increasing every year. It occurs through the respiratory tract. The spread of the disease is rapid and widespread. Since 1980, the disease has appeared just like bird flu in Asia. The outbreak of the 2014 Ebola virus in West Africa, severe acute respiratory infectious (SARS) disease and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused severe impact on the health system. Most respiratory diseases have no vaccines, such as SARS and Ebola. These diseases spread quickly and may be re-infected. After the flu season, there are several different types of influenza (Types A and B) and subtypes (Type A) that circulate and cause disease. For example, the bird flu virus has several subtypes such as H5N1, H7N3, H7N7, H7N9, and H9N2, which can infect humans [1].",

Although [2\u20136] has completed a great deal of work on dynamic modeling of influenza, it is limited to ordinary differential equations. However, currently, it has been found that the use of fractional differential equations to model many different fields of phenomena has been very successful [7\u201318]. For instance, in mathematical epidemiology, Ebola virus epidemic has been modeled with fractional-order differential equations by [19]. They used the SEIR fractional-order model to analyze data published by the WHO to provide projections of outbreaks in three countries in West Africa. The model considered fits precisely with the real data. Their findings revealed that the outbreak will last about two years, with an estimated 9 million infected people. Although individuals heredity play an important role in mortality rate of the disease, data analysis shows that the predicted death toll is very high.",

They used conventional time derivatives to express models that contain new parameters that happen to be fractional. They proved that the model is well defined, poses non-negative solutions and also established the conditions for boundedness. The Routh\u2013Hurwitz criterion was used to show the existence and stability analysis of Ebola virus model equilibrium states and showed that they strongly depend on non-linear propagation. Also, they provide the conditions for the persistence of the Ebola virus in the system. In addition, numerical simulations of non-linear propagation are provided and the results obtained are significant for combating and preventing Ebola hemorrhagic fever, which has so far caused the deaths of hundreds of families and continues to infect many people in West Africa.",

            "text": "Fractional diffusion mimics the human mobility network by simulating disease outbreaks [21]. Human mobility networks can smooth the spread of infectious diseases from the sidewalk to the flight route. The effort of control and removal depends on describing these networks in terms of individual connections and flux rates between the contact nodes. In some cases, transportation can be parametrized by a gravity-type model or approximated by diffuse random walks. Alternatively, they separated domestic commercial air traffic into a case study of the utility of non-diffusion heavy-tailed transport models. A new stochastic simulation of typical influenza-like infections was adopted, targeting the dense, highly connected America air travel network. They show that the mobility on the network can be defined mainly by a power law, which is consistent with the previous study. They observed that the global evolution of an outbreak on the network is precisely reproduced by a two-parameter space-fractional diffusion equation, which is determined by the air travel network. The dynamic changes of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses in Ebola virus infection in vivo are described by a fractional-order model with time delay [22]. They introduced a time-delay during the CTL response period to represent the time required to simulate the immune system. Stability and Hopf bifurcation were obtained from the model through fractional Laplace transform. Moreover, the stability conditions show that the dynamics of the model can be improved by the fractional-order delay.",

In addition, it is also obvious that modeling by fractional order derivative can capture any natural phenomena or a rich variety of dynamics observed in the system. Many of the past models focused only on the analysis of the influenza outbreaks in human populations. But, a model in which the order is an integer to describe the transmission of a respiratory epidemic has recently been proposed in [26]. However, modeling the transmission of a respiratory epidemic by fractional order model might provide a feasible alternative in controlling or probably eradicating the disease.",

Also, we applied the Atanackovic and Stankovic method to provide a numerical solution to system (5).
