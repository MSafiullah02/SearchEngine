This process has been termed 'trained immunity', a de facto innate immune memory. Research in the past decade has pointed to the broad benefits of trained immunity for host defence but has also suggested potentially detrimental outcomes in immune-mediated and chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we define 'trained immunity' as a biological process and discuss the innate stimuli and the epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming events that shape the induction of trained immunity. \u2709",

Cells of the innate immune system recognize pathogens and tissue damage through germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) 1,2 , which sense diverse pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns. The processes activated on engagement of PRRs are rapid, are considered to be non-specific and include responses such as phagocytosis, cell locomotion, killing of pathogens or cells, and cytokine production. These innate immune mechanisms are usually very effective in eliminating invading pathogens. Additionally, dendritic cells (DCs) and specialized T cells and B cells drive adaptive immune responses, which can be concomitantly induced. These lymphocyte-dependent adaptive immune responses are slower to develop but are antigen specific and lead to long-term immunological memory 3 .",

However, a growing body of literature indicating that innate immune cells -and even tissue-resident stem cells -can show adaptive characteristics has challenged this dogma [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Greater protection against reinfection -a de facto immune memory function -has also been reported in plants and invertebrates 9-11 , which lack an adaptive immune system. This demonstrates that adaptation of host defence can occur on the basis of innate-like immune mechanisms. Moreover, certain infections and vaccinations can induce broad protection against other pathogens through innate immune mechanisms 5, 12 . Conversely, the phenomenon called 'LPS tolerance' , which can be induced by low doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other Toll-like receptor ligands, is also an adaptation of cellular responses to an external stimulus, but which leads to a lower inflammatory response to a second stimulation 13 .",

It is important to underline that trained immunity represents the concept of long-term adaptation of innate Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) . Germline-encoded receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns -evolutionarily conserved structures associated with pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites -and damage-associated molecular patterns, which are exposed in damaged host tissues. There are four main families of PRRs: namely, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors and RIG1-like receptors.

By contrast, invertebrate species rely solely on the innate immune system for defence against pathogens and recognition of tissue damage. In vertebrates, on encounter with a threat and activation of particular lymphocyte clones that recognize specific antigens from the invading pathogens, de novo rearrangement of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene segments occurs. This 'on demand' production of novel and diverse receptors forms the basis for lymphocyte-mediated specific immune memory responses in jawed vertebrates (the gnathostomes) 18 . An alternative adaptive immune system evolved in jawless vertebrates, in which specific lymphocyte-mediated immune memory is mediated by variable lymphocyte receptors generated via the somatic rearrangement of gene elements encoding leucine-rich repeat motifs 19 . Both immunoglobulin-based and variable lymphocyte receptor-based adaptive immune processes in highly differentiated immune cells (that is, memory T cells and B cells or gnathostome lymphocytes) induce a recall immune response to the previously encountered pathogen that is both stronger and highly specific to the pathogen, ensuring improved survival of the organism.",

For example, vaccination with the BCG vaccine was shown to protect animals against secondary infections with Candida albicans, Schistosoma mansoni and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [30] [31] [32] . The non-specific character of the protection argues against a significant role of adaptive immunity for mediating this type of cross protection and suggests activation of rather non-specific protective innate immune mechanisms. The BCG vaccine also protects against lethal candidiasis in SCID mice, which lack functional T cells and B cells 23, 33, 34 . Similarly, a prior mild infection with C. albicans protects against the subsequent exposure to a normally lethal candidiasis infection 35 in both athymic mice and in recombination-activating gene 1 (RAG1)-deficient mice, further demonstrating the T cell-independent mechanisms of trained immunity 36, 37 . In these studies, the ability of a prior infection to provide protection against infection with unrelated pathogens was dependent on macrophages 35 and on proinflammatory cytokine production 38 . Importantly, a recent study showed that multiple passages of C. albicans through the gut of mice, leading to an adaptation of the fungus towards colonization, results in a stronger capacity to induce trained immunity and improved protection against non-specific infections in a lymphocyte-independent manner 39 .",

            "text": "Trained immunity in humans. An increasing body of evidence suggests that trained immunity plays a critical role in humans. First, an extensive collection of epidemiological data argues that live vaccines such as the BCG vaccine, measles vaccine, smallpox vaccine and oral polio vaccine have beneficial, non-specific protective effects against infections other than the target diseases [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] (for a review, see also ReF. 48 ). Subsequently, proof-of-principle trials with the BCG vaccine in adults 23, 49 and children 50, 51 demonstrated that this vaccine induces non-specific activation of innate immune cells. Interestingly, both epidemiological and immunological studies have shown that the vaccine effects may last for months, but may also be modified or even reversed when a non-live vaccine is given 52, 53 . Furthermore, BCG vaccination led to protection against microorganisms in models of controlled human infection, such as yellow fever 54 or malaria 55 , and this was associated with an augmented proinflammatory activity of monocytes (BOx 1). Second, certain infections, such as malaria, induce a state of hyper-responsiveness that is functionally equivalent to induction of trained immunity [56] [57] [58] . Finally, there is evidence that BCG vaccination can induce antitumour immune effects leading to the prevention or treatment of malignancies such as bladder cancer 59 , melanoma 60 , leukaemia 61 and lymphoma 62 . Notably, these anticancer effects of BCG seem to be dependent on its capacity to induce trained immunity in monocytes and macrophages 63 .",

Some of the first evidence that macrophages have adaptive features came from investigations of LPS tolerance, which demonstrated that gene-specific chromatin modifications were associated with the silencing of genes coding for inflammatory molecules and the priming of other genes encoding antimicrobial molecules 64 . Subsequent studies showed that exposure of monocytes or macrophages to C. albicans or the fungal cell wall component \u03b2-glucan enhanced the subsequent response of these myeloid cells to stimulation with unrelated pathogens or pathogenassociated molecular patterns 37 . Induction of trained immunity in monocytes was accompanied by the alteration of several chromatin marks 37, 65 . In addition to the data from infections with bacterial and fungal pathogens, other studies have shown that monocytes or macrophages can mount trained immune responses following infection with parasites 66 . Recent work has shown that DCs can also show immune memory responses. In this regard, DCs isolated from mice exposed to the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans displayed strong interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) production and enhanced proinflammatory cytokine responses on subsequent challenge, which is indicative of a memory response 67 . These effects were dependent on epigenetic changes and were impaired by the treatment of mice with a histone methyltransferase inhibitor 67 .",

Experimental studies demonstrated that mouse and human NK cells possess adaptive immune characteristics following infection with mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) or human cytomegalovirus, respectively [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] . Mouse NK cells bearing the Ly49H receptor possess antigen specificity for MCMV-encoded glycoprotein m157 (ReFs 74,75 ), can undergo clonal proliferation (as much as 10 4 -fold expansion from a single NK cell clone) 76, 77 and persist during the contraction and memory phases similarly to CD8 + T cells 78 . On reinfection, these memory NK cells undergo a secondary expansion and can more rapidly degranulate and release cytokines, resulting in a more protective immune response against MCMV 69, 79 . In human NK cells, the NKG2C receptor can mediate a similar function through recognition of human cytomegalovirus-encoded UL40 peptides presented on the non-classical MHC molecule HLA-E 80,81 .",

A response in innate-like lymphocytes that more closely resembles trained immunity is perhaps the non-antigen specific priming of NK cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) by proinflammatory cytokines. Mouse and human NK cells exposed to IL-12 and IL-18 showed more robust production of IFN\u03b3 weeks after initial priming 84, 85 , and transplantation of these cytokine-induced memory-like NK cells has shown efficacy in clinical trials to treat leukaemias 86 . Even in the adaptive responses of MCMV-specific NK cells, proinflammatory cytokine signals are critical for the formation of robust effector and memory NK cells [87] [88] [89] . It was recently found that liver-resident group 1 ILCs (ILC1s) also expand and persist after infection with MCMV, acquiring stable transcriptional, epigenetic and phenotypical changes 1 month after the resolution of systemic infection, and showed enhanced memory responses 90 . In this setting, both proinflammatory cytokines and antigen specificity (NK1.1 receptor-mediated recognition of MCMV-encoded m12) were critical in driving a memory response in ILC1s 90 . ILC2s have also been suggested to possess features of immunological memory following stimulation with allergens 91 , perhaps resembling prior studies of hapten-induced priming of NK cells in delayed hypersensitivity responses 92 . Anamnestic immunity in NK cells may also play an important role in physiological processes such as pregnancy. A recent study showed that NK cells from women who have been repeatedly pregnant show a particular epigenetic and transcriptomic landscape, with open chromatin around the enhancers of IFNG and VEGFA, improving placentation and supporting vascular sprouting 93 .",

The discovery of inflammatory memory behaviour in epidermal stem cells is of particular relevance, as tissue stem cells are the cornerstone of regeneration in homeostasis and they reside in distinct microenvironments or niches and exchange signals that define their tasks and their molecular behaviours 6,94 . Although the rate of cellular replacement during homeostasis is tissue and context specific, even quiescent stem cells are mobilized into action on tissue injury. Similarly, inflammation and infections perturb the niche microenvironment, which can override the normal homeostatic cues and prompt changes in stem cell behaviours. Thus, through their ability to sense and respond to niche signals, stem cells can adjust to and survive stressful situations. Remarkably, stem cells form an enduring epigenetic memory from such encounters, which equips them with the ability to mobilize more rapidly during subsequent assaults 6, 95 .",

Despite successful treatment of several patients, Coley's approach was met with criticism and scepticism because of its unpredictability and the risk of promoting dangerous systemic inflammation. approximately half a century later, in the late 1950s, the BCG vaccine was developed into a novel immunotherapy to treat cancer by Lloyd Old and colleagues 179 . Currently, BCG vaccination is a us Food and Drug administration-approved treatment modality for bladder cancer, and although not currently part of standard clinical care, it is also used for other treatment of malignancies such as lymphoma and melanoma. \u03b2-Glucan has long been used in east asia to boost immune responses in patients with cancer, and it is currently in clinical trials in the usa in combination with checkpoint inhibitors [180] [181] [182] . several alternative strategies to activate innate immunity and thereby trained immunity by injecting immunostimulatory agents into tumours are currently being developed together with checkpoint blockade, including activators of the NLrP3, stiNG, toll-like receptor and riG1 pathways. trained immunity-induced rebalancing of macrophage and DC function may overcome the immunosuppressive microenvironment, facilitating the performance of existing T cell immunotherapies, chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy 183 and checkpoint inhibitors 184 . the challenge in the coming years will be to identify potent agents that induce antitumoural trained immunity processes without promoting excessive systemic side effects.

Stem cells do not merely take instructions but rather they also actively instruct the immune system. In the skin, for example, stem cells can sense when their niche barrier is breached and produce signals to recruit specific immune cell sentinels, even under conditions where the immune system itself has been suppressed 7 . In turn, recruited immune cells can signal to stem cells to proliferate and patch the barrier. In this way, the coordination is honed to achieve maximal tissue repair. Another cell type that can acquire a trained immunity-like phenotype is the fibroblast.

More recent work has helped to resolve this issue by showing that trained immunity can occur in bone marrow progenitor cells (central trained immunity), as well as in blood monocytes and tissue macrophages (peripheral trained immunity) (FIG. 2) .",

Conceivably, tissues exposed to the outside world, such as the skin, the lungs and the intestine, are prone to encounter immune training-inducing stimuli. This concept was explored in the lung using two models of viral challenge: namely, latent gammaherpesvirus infection and adenovirus infection 106, 107 . The severity of house dust mite-induced asthma was decreased in the lungs of mice that had previously been chronically infected with gammaherpesvirus 106 . This phenotype was dependent on the long-term generation and maintenance of monocyte-derived regulatory alveolar macrophages that conferred protection against the development of an allergic response in the lung. Conversely, adenovirus infection induced remodelling in alveolar macrophages, which are long-lived tissue-resident cells, such that they retained the information of an inflammatory history and subsequently Although trained immunity was first established in cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage (that is, monocytes and macrophages), monocytes have a relatively short lifespan and are unlikely to transmit their memory phenotype to their progeny and provide sustainable protection. Thus, current vaccine strategies that directly target monocytes or macrophages may have limited capacity for generating sustained innate immune memory. By contrast, haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are long-lived cells with self-renewal properties that reside in the bone marrow. The bone marrow is the site of haematopoiesis where HSCs continually undergo asymmetric division giving rise to the full repertoire of myeloid and lymphoid cell types. HSCs can directly respond to acute and chronic infections. Although the exact mechanisms of precursor proliferation or differentiation are not well understood, persistent activation of HSCs can result in their exhaustion, leading to devastating effects on the systemic immune compartment. Monocytes derived from trained HSCs migrate to peripheral organs, where they give rise to monocyte-derived macrophages with enhanced effector functions against different types of pathogens. Natural killer (NK) cells possess adaptive immune characteristics following infection. On reinfection, these memory NK cells undergo a secondary expansion and can more rapidly degranulate and release cytokines, resulting in a more protective immune response. Epithelial stem cells show memory functions during human allergic inflammatory disease, displaying changes in the chromatin accessibility when the stimulus is withdrawn. BCG, bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin; CMP, common myeloid progenitor: GMP, granulocyte-macrophage progenitor ; MPP, multipotent progenitor. Nature reviews | Immunology induced more pronounced antibacterial immunity 107 . However, in the case of the adenovirus infection, the tissue-specific training phenotype was dependent on the polarization of CD8 + T cells by trained alveolar macro phages and therefore provided a link between trained and adaptive immunity. Together, these two recent studies highlight the importance of tissue-specific training cues, which are likely to occur consecutively over an individual's lifespan, raising the question of how these training cues contribute to protection against infections and the development of inflammatory diseases and cancer.",

Many studies have demonstrated that stimulation of innate immune cells can leave an 'epigenetic scar' at the level of stimulated genes, changing the long-term responsiveness of the cells that manifests itself as functional trained immunity programmes. Intrinsic to the presence of such an epigenetic scar is the question of how it is selectively directed to specific locations in the genome, either at the promoters of stimulated genes or at distal regulatory elements. Two key epigenetic marks accompany trained immunity: the acquisition of histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) marks at distal enhancers (marked with histone 3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me1)) and the consolidation of histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks at the promoters of stimulated genes (FIG. 4) . Transcription is an inherently stochastic process, which is regulated by several factors, including the random collision of transcription factors with upstream promoter and enhancer DNA regions. However, dynamic loop-mediated regulation and the resulting stochastic responses in gene expression may not be ideal for gene classes that need to respond both immediately and uniformly to external stimuli across cell populations. This suggests that to reduce stochasticity in gene expression, the chromosomal contact between rapidly responding genes may exist in a more stable or preformed state, which strongly implicates the influence of chromosomal looping and TAD structure on this subclass of transcriptional responses. Studies using Hi-C (a method for analysing chromatin interactions) have revealed that several classes of innate immune genes are segregated into TADs and interact within multigene complexes. A recent study demonstrated how TAD structure enables a class of lncRNAs called 'immune gene-priming lncRNAs' (IPLs) to be brought into close proximity with transcriptionally poised innate immune genes, before their transcriptional activation 110 . IPLs exploit preformed 3D looping contacts to bring the H3K4me3 histone-modifying complex close to the promoters of highly responsive innate immune genes, permitting their epigenetic activation and training. The insertion of an IPL in the mouse preformed chemokine TAD confers these genes with the ability to transcriptionally respond rapidly and robustly (uniformly across all cells in the population) and to be accessible to training by \u03b2-glucan. The latter is a property they previously did not have in the absence of the IPL 110 . As current studies have investigated the role of IPLs only in \u03b2-glucan-induced trained immunity phenotypes, further studies are warranted to explore these mechanisms in other experimental settings, including the importance of IPLs during in vivo vaccination.",

It is clear from mouse HSC data that after BCG exposure, the acquisition of open chromatin as measured by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) begins in HSCs, and acetylation drives the opening of specific TADs 32 . The specific locations of these marks are, at least partially, preserved through the differentiation of HSCs into different myeloid and lymphoid lineage cells 32 . It is likely that in terminally differentiated myeloid cells, the H3K4me1 marks established in the HSC lineage continue to be present, and the gain and loss of H3K27ac occurs in response to exposure to LPS tolerization and \u03b2-glucan priming, even though this question remains to be formally analysed and established. The transmission of these marks through DNA replication and the cell cycle is a central conundrum around how trained immunity is stably maintained 111 .

During primary challenge, the recognition of specific ligands by pattern recognition receptors triggers a series of intracellular cascades that lead to the upregulation of different metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and fatty acid metabolism. Certain metabolites derived from these processes, such as fumarate and acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), can activate or inhibit a series of enzymes involved in remodelling the epigenetic landscape of cells, such as the histone demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 5 (KDM5) or histone acetyltransferases, leading to specific changes in histone methylation and acetylation of genes involved in the innate immune responses. \u03b2-Glucan-mediated activation of dectin 1 signalling also triggers calcium influx, which leads to the dephosphorylation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), allowing its translocation into the nucleus, where it may bind to DNA and activate gene transcription. This facilitates the accessibility of the DNA to the transcriptional machinery and gene regulatory elements and specific long non-coding RNAs, promoting and facilitating an enhanced gene transcription on secondary stimulation of the cells.

It is well established that metabolites can modulate the activity of chromatin-modifying enzymes 128 ; hence, metabolic rewiring of innate immune cells or their progenitors will regulate their plasticity and epigenomic reprogramming in the context of trained immunity 125 . Increased aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of \u03b2-glucan-trained monocytes; this is mediated by a pathway that involves the activity of AKT, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1). Consistently, blockade of the AKT-mTOR-HIF1\u03b1 pathway abrogates trained immunity 129 . Furthermore, BCG-induced trained immunity requires the functional reprogramming of monocyte metabolism towards aerobic glycolysis to develop enhanced responsiveness to subsequent stimulation 130 . Subsequent studies with integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses of human \u03b2-glucan-trained monocytes revealed crosstalk between glycolysis and glutaminolysis in trained immunity 131 . Trained monocytes accumulate the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) metabolite fumarate, which influences epigenetic reprogramming by downregulating the activity of KDM5 histone demethylases 131 . Moreover, different TCA intermediates exert distinct effects on innate immune cell activity. For instance, \u03b1-ketoglutarate promotes anti-inflammatory activation of macrophages via epigenetic reprogramming that is mediated by the H3K27 demethylase JMJD3. Moreover, \u03b1-ketoglutarate facilitates endotoxin tolerance after classic LPS-mediated or IFN\u03b3-mediated activation of macrophages 132 .",

            "text": "By contrast, LPS-induced succinate regulates a proinflammatory HIF1\u03b1-IL-1\u03b2 pathway in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages 133 . The metabolite itaconate, the concentration of which is highly upregulated in LPS-activated macrophages, exerts www.nature.com/nri anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the succinate dehydrogenase-mediated oxidation of succinate to fumarate 134, 135 . Itaconate itself acts in an antiinflammatory fashion in macrophages by supporting the activity of the anti-inflammatory transcription factor NRF2 (ReF. 136 ) and the inhibition of LPS-mediated I\u03baB induction. The latter effect of itaconate is independent of NRF2 but requires activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) 137 . Of note, itaconate-induced tolerance in human monocytes is counteracted by \u03b2-glucan-induced trained immunity as \u03b2-glucan inhibits the expression of immune-responsive gene 1 (IRG1) protein, the enzyme responsible for itaconate generation. Consistent with fumarate accumulation in \u03b2-glucan-trained monocytes 131 , \u03b2-glucan-mediated inhibition of IRG1 results in elevated expression of succinate dehydrogenase 138 . Thus, \u03b2-glucan-induced trained immunity is associated with enhanced succinate dehydrogenase activity and accumulation of fumarate as well as with reversing the endotoxin tolerance-inducing effects of itaconate, which acts as an antagonist of succinate dehydrogenase. Enhanced cholesterol synthesis is also an important hallmark of \u03b2-glucan-trained monocytes. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor fluvastatin blocks trained immunity in primary human monocytes 131 . Interestingly, this is accomplished not by cholesterol biosynthesis but rather by an accumulation of the upstream metabolite mevalonate. Brief exposure to mevalonate can trigger training of monocytes via the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor and stimulation of mTOR signalling 139 . Importantly, enhanced cholesterol synthesis is critical for the \u03b2-glucan-induced training of not only mature myeloid cells but also of their progenitors (haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs)). The long-term myelopoiesis bias conferred to HSPCs by \u03b2-glucan-induced training is associated with accumulation of cholesterol esters and lipids with more saturated acyl chains 104 . Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase diminishes \u03b2-glucan-induced HSPC population expansion and myelopoiesis 104 . The enhanced cholesterol levels that occur in HSPCs as a result of innate training may promote a myelopoiesis bias via upregulation of CD131, the common \u03b2-subunit of the IL-3/GM-CSF receptor 104 . This is consistent with findings showing that inhibition of cholesterol efflux in HSPCs, due to deficiency in the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1, also enhances CD131 expression and myelopoiesis in the bone marrow 140, 141 .",

The dietary intervention induced increased inflammatory responses to subsequent innate immune stimuli. This trained immunity phenotype persisted even after the mice had been switched to a standard chow diet for another 4 weeks, despite circulating cholesterol levels and systemic inflammatory markers returning to normal 8 .

Short-term treatment with a high-density lipoprotein nanobiologic that specifically inhibited mTOR in myeloid cells was able to prevent aerobic glycolysis and epigenetic modifications underlying trained immunity.

For example, prior BCG vaccination has been shown to enhance antibody responses to many other vaccines that are subsequently administered 151, 152 . On the other hand, there could be negative consequences. Neurodegenerative diseases constitute a significant group of age-related diseases associated with chronic inflammation 153 . Peripheral application of inflammatory stimuli in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease leads to long-lasting training of microglia, the brain-resident macrophages, which exacerbates cerebral \u03b2-amyloidosis 154 . The functional changes of microglia are accompanied by activating epigenetic changes at the HIF1A gene locus, consistent with the peripheral trained immunity response 129 . As a consequence of epigenetic reprogramming, microglia also show changes in transcription and protein expression. Even infections of mice very early in life as a means of immunological training seem to be able to contribute to the impairment of microglial function followed by amyloid-\u03b2induced synapse damage and cognitive impairment 155 . Together, these studies suggest that systemic inflammation induces microglia reprogramming, resulting in potentially hyper-responsive 'trained' states of the brain immune system. Another brain pathological abnormality linked to systemic inflammation and associated with dementia is cerebral small vessel disease 156 . In patients with cerebral small vessel disease, peripheral blood-derived monocytes showed trained immunity characteristics such as enhanced IL-6 and IL-8 production after ex vivo stimulation, which was also associated with the severity and progression of the disease 157 . A causal link to the pathophysiology of the small vessels in the brain remains to be determined. The pathophysiology of acute stroke is unaltered by prior peripheral immune stimulation 154 , which might suggest that chronic rather than acute inflammatory conditions are associated with both trained immunity and the induction of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Accumulating evidence suggests that there is a link between trained immunity and 'inflammageing' , the inflammatory condition related to an ageing immune system 158 . For example, age-related reprogramming of specific innate immune cells might enhance effector mechanisms associated with trained immunity (such as production of IL-8 (ReF. 159 ) and CCL1 (ReF. 160 )), thereby leading to hyper-reactivity. Collectively, a better understanding of the dark side of trained immunity in ageing populations might help us to fight inflammageing-related chronic diseases such as dementia in elderly patients.",

Tumour cells can also reprogramme infiltrating innate immune cells to acquire a more anti-inflammatory phenotype that is reminiscent of the immunoparalysis observed in patients with sepsis; for instance, monocytes from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia show low levels of cytokine production, high phagocytic activity and impaired antigen presentation 162 .

Furthermore, new epidemiological study results intriguingly suggest that the non-specific beneficial effects of live vaccines may be amplified if the vaccines are given in the presence of pre-existing immunity, be it from parental priming or from a previous vaccine 16, 172 . Thus, a modified vaccination programme that provides live vaccines earlier, in the presence of maternal immunity, and in multiple doses may lead to increased innate training.

The impact of trained immunity, and more generally of epigenetic rewiring in various processes of priming, adaptation or tolerance during disease 111 , warrants further studies. Also, the role of trained immunity during the ageing process, and the potential association with clonal haematopoiesis, is an important area for future research.

Notably, preventing trained immunity rebalanced the myeloid cell compartment from proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory, while the adaptive immune system was characterized by an increased frequency of regulatory T cells. Co-treatment with a nanoimmunotherapeutic agent that prevents CD40-CD40L co-stimulation 186 led to the induction of tolerance. these observations highlight that the innate and adaptive immune systems work in conjunction, and that immune memory can be best considered a feature relevant to phagocytes and lymphocytes 187 .",

            "text": "in addition to targeting myeloid cell metabolic pathways such as the mtOr or hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 pathway, inhibiting endogenous mediators of trained immunity such as the NLrP3 inflammasome or iL-1\u03b2 release is an alternative strategy to suppress trained immunity's inflammatory component. this was explored in patients with cardiovascular disease in the Canakinumab anti-inflammatory thrombosis Outcome study (CaNtOs) 188 . Finally, regulating epigenetic processes is another compelling therapeutic avenue towards inhibiting trained immunity. suppression of trained immunity may also be achieved by restricting epigenetic changes with, for example, inhibitors of histone or DNa methylation. Moreover, after the promotion or inhibition of trained immunity, the duration of this phenomenon may be managed by epigenetic modulators that can maintain a certain state of the chromatin in relevant genomic regions. small molecules that target various epigenetic enzymes (from histone deacetylase inhibitors to modulators of histone methylation and bromodomain inhibitors) are being developed for use in cancer therapy 189, 190 . the applicability of such approaches for other immunomediated diseases is an important avenue to be investigated soon. Finally, approaches targeting such novel compounds to the relevant cell population, especially myeloid cells and their precursors, should be attempted for specific therapy with weak side effects. Bone marrow-targeted nanotherapeutics may offer such a path towards novel therapies.",
