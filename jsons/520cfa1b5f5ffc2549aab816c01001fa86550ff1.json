These results were consistent using alternative definitions of hemodynamic change (cardiac output and MAP). Our study shows that the baseline risk of RV failure among patients with ARDS does not modify the effect of HFOV on 30-day mortality. Furthermore, the effect of HFOV is not mediated by immediate hemodynamic changes. However, patients with a higher baseline ACP risk score are at increased risk of death, a finding likely explained by illness severity. Limitations of the study include lack of echocardiographic definition of RV failure at baseline and after randomization (see Online appendix). Further studies should evaluate specific subgroups of patients with very severe ARDS that may benefit from this treatment strategy.",
