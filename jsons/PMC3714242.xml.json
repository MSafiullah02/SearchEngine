Knowledge of how the international community is connected to the Middle East through air travel during this time period is not well understood, but could help cities and countries worldwide optimally distribute their finite resources for enhanced MERS-CoV surveillance and public health preparedness. Furthermore, it could help the international community identify countries that have strong travel connections to Saudi Arabia and the Middle East but which have limited capacity to detect MERS-CoV in a timely manner, and if necessary, mobilize an effective public health response to imported cases including the implementation of rigorous infection control practices. Adopting a proactive and anticipatory approach to the international spread of MERS-CoV may help to mitigate its global health and economic consequences.",

IATA captures 93% of the world\u2019s commercial air traffic data and uses market intelligence to produce estimates for the remainder. Each flight itinerary encompassed data on the city where each traveler initiated their trip along with all connecting flights en route to their final destination. For all travelers initiating trips within the aforementioned four countries, not including persons transiting through these countries from other international points of origin, we calculated the total number of travelers with final destinations at each international airport worldwide. Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar and UAE were selected as the points of origin for travelers in this descriptive statistical analysis because to date, all confirmed MERS-CoV cases in international travelers have been linked back to these four countries. We then compared these global travel patterns with those observed during the previous five years (i.e. June to November for each year from 2007 to 2011) to determine if there was a consistent seasonal pattern. As a large proportion of foreign Hajj pilgrims travel to and from Saudi Arabia via unscheduled charter flights, which are not captured in the aforementioned analysis, we concurrently modeled the expected national origins of Hajj pilgrims in 2013. To do this, we multiplied the total number of foreign Hajj pilgrims in 2012 13 by the proportions of pilgrims originating from individual countries based on Muslim population estimates from the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and medical literature, 16\n,\n17 and assumed a comparable number of pilgrims in 2013 relative to 2012. We then compared these values with the World Bank economic classifications of countries and estimates of national healthcare expenditures per capita 18 as simplified, albeit imperfect surrogate markers of public health capacity (i.e. their ability to detect imported MERS-CoV in a timely manner and mobilize an effective public health response to such cases).",

Furthermore, with millions of foreign pilgrims set to congregate in Mecca and Medina between Ramadan and Hajj, pilgrims could acquire and subsequently return to their home countries with MERS-CoV, either through direct exposure to the as of yet unidentified source or through contact with domestic pilgrims who may be infected. Our findings also indicate that two-thirds of all Hajj pilgrims will be returning to low or lower-middle income countries where medical and public health capacity will be limited, and presumably where the risk of domestic transmission of imported MERS-CoV will be elevated.",

In the case of MERS-CoV, rigorous efforts in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East are ongoing to identify the presumed animal origins of this novel human coronavirus. While there is presently no evidence to indicate that animal livestock are a direct or intermediate source of MERS-CoV, reasonably excluding this possibility will be important since millions of animals, including goats, sheep, cattle and camels will be sacrificed during Ramadan and at the end of Hajj (i.e. Eid-al Adha or Festival of Sacrifice).

Furthermore, we did not account for the approximately 10% of foreign pilgrims that travel to Saudi Arabia by land or sea from neighbouring countries to perform the Hajj. 17 We were also limited by an imprecise understanding of the spatial extent of the animal and/or environmental source of MERS-CoV within the Middle East, which required us to consider all domestic and international airports in Saudi Arabia,Jordan,Qatar and UAE.

            "text": "Ten years after the emergence of a novel coronavirus in China\u2019s Guangdong province,33 a new virus has emerged with its epicenter in the Middle East, and with a mortality rate among confirmed cases exceeding 50%. While the ability of this virus to spread from person-to-person thus far appears somewhat limited,34 super-spreading events as observed during SARS 33 could significantly alter the global course of this epidemic. Compared with SARS, which began to spread internationally in the spring of 2003 to predominantly high income countries with strong travel links to China, MERS will coincide with two mass gatherings in Saudi Arabia that are expected to draw millions of travelers and Muslim pilgrims from predominantly resource poor countries with limited capacity to detect and respond to imported cases.",
