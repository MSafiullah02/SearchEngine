Obesity is a long-recognized factor for severe pulmonary infections 30 and has been consistently associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 31 . Low systolic arterial pressure and respiratory rate at triage evaluation complete the clinical ABC-GOALS. Among the three derived scores in this study, the clinical ABC-GOALS has an inferior performance and remains to be externally validated, as some reported models based exclusively in demographic (but not physical examination) information have been shown to decrease their performance after external validation 12 .",

The study involves only derivation of the score and therefore, the score still needs further validation in our population as well as external validation in other populations. However, the actual need for a tool to predict ICU admission and to timely refer patients compelled us to start using this tool locally and to validate it over the progress of the pandemic. Another limitation is that medical practice and admission criteria to ICU may vary between institutions and countries, especially in stressed health systems. This score was derived from a population living in Mexico City at >7300 feet over the sea level. The mean partial pressure of oxygen at this altitude has been estimated at around 66mmHg (estimated normal baseline P/F ratio \u2248 314) 37,38 . We therefore used the S/F ratio to account for respiratory compensation and the right-shift of the hemoglobin dissociation curve that takes place at higher altitudes (higher p50 values in Mexico City). Then, local validation is needed for this score. Finally, the thresholds set to define the risk groups should be adapted to local needs.",
