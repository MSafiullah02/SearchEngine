AKI occurred at or within 48 h of ARDS development in 765 (39%) of 1974 ARDS patients, with a further 4.3% developing AKI on days 3\u20137 of ARDS. Of the 228 AKI patients (30%) that received RRT, 62% commenced within 48 h, 29% between days 3 and 7, and 9% between days 8 and 28 following ARDS development. Reassuringly, the impact of AKI on the ventilatory management of patients with ARDS appeared limited. Specifically, despite the presence of acidosis in patients with AKI, there were no differences in arterial CO2 tension, or in tidal or minute ventilation between the groups. While our data do not exclude the potential for an impact of AKI on lung function, it does appear that \u2018protective\u2019 ventilatory strategies were prioritized over attempts to compensate for pH status.",

Specifically, no association was found between ventilatory variables (i.e. tidal volume, total respiratory rate, FIO2, PEEP,) or indices of lung injury severity (i.e. peak inspiratory pressure and PaO2/FiO2) and the presence of AKI. Of importance, this analysis identified known \u2018ARDS risk factors\u2019 such as sepsis [4], non-cardiogenic shock, TRALI and pancreatitis, as independent risk factors for AKI. The presence of shock was also associated with AKI development. This analysis suggests that these factors constitute common underlying injury mechanisms that drive the concomitant development of organ failures, including AKI and ARDS, in the critically ill.",

In the LUNG SAFE cohort, AKI and ARDS frequently evolved contemporaneously and early in the course of critical illness, likely driven by common underlying pathophysiologic processes. Our findings did not support a central role for lung\u2013kidney \u2018cross talk\u2019 in mediating early AKI in patients with ARDS, with no evidence that the presence of AKI impacted ARDS management, or that the ventilatory management or ARDS severity was associated with risk of AKI development. These findings do not preclude a role for lung\u2013kidney cross-talk in the development of AKI later in the course of ARDS, or for ARDS to negatively impact the resolution of AKI. A better understanding of the roles of shared underlying risk factors such as sepsis, the overall severity of critical illness, hemodynamic instability and of Lung-Kidney \u2018cross-talk\u2019 is essential to improving outcomes in these patients.",
