They also noticed having ample seating on public transportation, because no one wanted to sit next to them. On a more subtle level, children of health care workers noted that their friends\u2019 parents canceled play dates and social events for vague reasons. This issue was quickly picked up by the media, and a successful campaign ensued that helped health care workers be treated as brave professionals, rather than as potentially infectious persons.",

Similarly, routine use of infection control measures, including the costs of PPE, time taken to don and doff, and greatly reduced work efficiency among health care workers need to be factored in. The question of expertise arose when physiatrists had to manage medical complications themselves instead of being able to call in consultants or transfer patients to an appropriate specialist. The accuracy of a telephone consultation that relies on the reported history and examination findings of the doctor calling the consult may be questioned. There is a high probability of fatigue and stress after a prolonged period under semimilitary rules and regulations, and attentiveness and vigilance to precautions may slip. Health care workers may need to prepare for extended periods in full PPE.",

Potential offsite facilities should be identified as satellites for caregiver teaching and possibly as outpatient clinics for follow-up and therapies in the event of an outbreak. An adequate supply of PPE, including masks, gown, and gloves, needs to be stockpiled and available while awaiting sources to ramp up emergency supplies. Rethinking may be necessary about having large common and open therapy areas for patients from several wards. Alternatively, smaller areas located near patient wards could be identified for rapid conversion, if necessary, into \u201cmini\u201d-therapy areas by moving in basic therapy equipment. Technologic and telecommunication aids, such as the computer, video, and television, can be used to teach rehabilitation.

Many of these recommendations will not be so critical if a vaccine is developed soon. Physiatrists may also need to keep current with internal medicine skills. This will allow them to continue to care for patients in a crisis where at least for the interim the practice of rehabilitation medicine is limited. Therapists may want to engage in crosstraining or intermittently work with patients outside their usual realm, in order to remain comfortable with nonfamiliar therapy activities.",
