Box 1\nsummarizes current views on the characteristics of the ideal biomarker. The biomarker should not only serve as a guide on when to stop antimicrobial treatment in noninfected infants but also aid in the decision of whether to start antibiotic treatment at the onset of nonspecific clinical signs. With advances in molecular biogenetic techniques, the ideal biomarker or test is also expected to pinpoint precisely the identity or category of microorganism causing sepsis.4 Information on the severity of infection and likelihood of progression to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) would also provide invaluable insights to clinicians for targeting infants with sepsis who are most in need of urgent treatment and intensive care support.5 Identification of the pathogen and antibiotic susceptibility profile at disease onset would also contribute enormously to acute management.Box 1The ideal biomarker or test for LONS\nClinical properties1.Provide an algorithm for starting and/or stopping antimicrobial treatment.

CRP is widely used in many NICUs for diagnosis and monitoring of treatment in LONS and NEC.10, 11, 12 It has been previously reported that CRP is a late biomarker with high specificity for neonatal sepsis.10 The concentration of serum CRP is usually not elevated at the time of clinical presentation but is delayed by 6 to 8 hours after onset of symptoms.10 Although CRP is generally considered a nonspecific biomarker, research has shown that it has high specificity for neonatal systemic infection because preterm infants have a narrow spectrum of disease compared with older patients. Noninfectious inflammatory conditions that can confound the diagnosis of sepsis in adult patients, such as rheumatoid arthritis, other connective tissue diseases, and inflammatory bowel disease, occur rarely in neonates. Therefore, significant increases in serum CRP concentrations are more likely to be associated with systemic sepsis or bowel inflammation/necrosis secondary to NEC. Serial measurements of CRP concentrations are particularly useful in ruling out sepsis, and persistently normal levels for 48 hours can assist in decision making for discontinuation of antibiotic treatment in infants with an equivocal presentation.13 There are limitations to the application of measuring CRP levels because both false-positive and false-negative results have been reported. Importantly, the test is not sensitive in diagnosing localized infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and isolated low-grade fungal central nervous system infection.14 It is also not a useful indicator after surgery or recent immunization because the circulating levels tend to be significantly elevated after these events.1\n",

In addition, another study performed by the same investigators indicated that the mortality in infected preterm infants was inversely correlated with circulating SAA at 8 hours and at 24 hours.16 These studies suggest that SAA may be a better biomarker than CRP and provide vital information on prognosis early in the course of infection.16\n",

IL-6 has a short half-life, and circulating levels decrease precipitously back to the baseline noninfectious state within 24 hours of appropriate treatment.10 IL-8 (a chemokine) follows a similar time course. This characteristic greatly limits the role of IL-6 and IL-8 as clinically useful biomarkers across all phases of sepsis, although they may have utility in the early presentation before therapy. The quantitation of intracellular IL-8 by treating whole blood samples with detergent to lyse white blood cells may lengthen the window of opportunity for obtaining blood samples and further enhance the diagnostic utility.29 Other chemokines and cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) \u03b1, monokine induced by interferon-\u03b3, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and growth-related oncogene \u03b1, are significantly upregulated during infection and NEC, whereas RANTES is downregulated, in some cases because of concomitant thrombocytopenia.27 The utility of these diagnostic biomarkers is not as promising as those mentioned earlier.27\n",

The magnitude and balance (or imbalance) of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory responses are a crucial reflection of the severity of sepsis and may play an important role in predicting morbidity and mortality.5, 31, 32 Despite the favorable properties of chemokines and cytokines, assessment using these mediators has not been successfully integrated into routine clinical practice. High-cost, nonautomated, labor-intensive methodology and the lack of on-demand testing in clinical laboratories are major obstacles that have prevented the evolution of cytokines as routine diagnostic tests in the NICU setting.",

During bacterial and fungal infection or NEC, these antigens are substantially upregulated and their concentrations on the cell surface can be accurately and quantitatively measured by flow cytometry. The authors\u2019 findings suggest that neutrophil CD64 is a sensitive biomarker for diagnosis of early-onset sepsis and LONS,34, 35, 36 and its upregulation significantly precedes that of CRP. Recently, neutrophil CD64 has also been demonstrated to be a good indicator of intra-abdominal sepsis, including NEC, bowel perforation, and peritonitis. As expected, this test is unable to differentiate between systemic infection and intra-abdominal sepsis/inflammation (Lam HS and colleagues, unpublished data, 2010). Neutrophil CD11b has also been suggested to be a sensitive biomarker for early-onset neonatal infection,37, 38 and a subsequent study on daily surveillance showed that neutrophil/monocyte CD11b could reveal evidence of infection up to 3 days before clinical manifestations.39 Such findings have not been repeated and would require validation by larger studies. Unlike with CD64, the results with CD11b are more variable, and the findings have not been consistent between centers.34 Expression of CD11b is also influenced by noninfectious conditions such as respiratory distress syndrome.40 The authors have compared neutrophil CD64 and neutrophil CD11b within the same study and found that CD64 had significantly better utility than CD11b in diagnosing LONS and NEC.34 Other cell-surface antigens, including NK cell CD69,41 lymphocyte CD25 and CD45RO,34 and an elaborate panel of leukocyte surface antigens including CD19, CD33, and CD66b, have also been investigated,33 but none showed better diagnostic utility than CD64 and CD11b. Advantages of flow cytometry include small blood volume (50 \u03bcL whole blood), rapid turnaround time (<4 hours), wide window of opportunity for blood sampling, and ability to perform the test on an ad hoc basis. The disadvantage is that flow cytometry requires skilled technicians to carry out multistep measurements semiautomatically, and flow cytometry is not considered a routine diagnostic evaluation in most NICUs.",

Molecular techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization can substantially reduce the time required to identify organisms isolated in culture.42 This reduction can be as much as 18 hours for bacterial isolates and 42 hours for yeasts.42 Directly detecting pathogen DNA is attractive, especially when the target is a fastidious or slow-growing organism. Molecular techniques that focus on identification of a single species of bacteria are not particularly useful in an intensive care setting. An ideal test would encompass a wide variety of pathogens commonly encountered in NICUs. The use of the probe-based gram-specific qPCR for rapid detection and differentiation of gram-negative and gram-positive bloodstream infections has been attempted in recent studies.4, 43 This test has very high specificity and positive predictive value, especially for identification of gram-negative organisms.4, 43 Although the test is not sensitive enough for ruling out sepsis, it is particularly useful for ruling in sepsis because of its high specificity. Thus, a positive test result would strongly indicate the need for a full course of antimicrobial treatment despite negative culture of pathogens.4 The identification of gram-specific sepsis would serve as a useful guide for prescribing appropriate and effective antibiotics and predicting the virulence of the causative pathogens and severity of infection.4, 43 The major limitations identified in these studies are (1) uncommon organisms not included in the genetic sequence of the primer/probes would escape detection and (2) gram-positive organisms and fungi with elaborate cell wall structures are resilient to digestion and destruction, posing a major problem for DNA extraction.4 Use of molecular diagnostics for detecting bloodstream infections in neonates has shown some promise and some technical challenges.44\n",

This conventional approach greatly confines and restricts the search for biomarkers to known mediators or proteins of the cascade. In contrast, the proteomics technology with its \u201chypothesis-free\u201d approach can potentially discover novel host response biomarkers for diagnosis of LONS and NEC in preterm infants. The authors recently completed a proteomics project and discovered one known protein and one novel lipoprotein for early and accurate identification of infants with sepsis and NEC.49 A new proteomics sepsis score derived from these two biomarkers would guide frontline neonatologists whether to \u2018start\u2019 antibiotic treatment at the time of clinical presentation and to \u2018stop\u2019 therapy within 24 hours of commencement. This score ensures patient safety with 100% negative predictive value. It would preclude a significant proportion (>60%) of true non-sepsis cases from receiving antibiotics unnecessarily or for very early withdrawal of treatment. The proteomics technology may further assist in identifying novel biochemical pathways associated with infection. It is a powerful tool for biomarker discovery, and we have demonstrated that the technology can be competently applied to very premature infants. A limitation of proteomics is that proteins with low plasma concentrations, such as chemokines and cytokines, may not be easily detected by this method. In addition, a stringent protocol with elaborate study design is required to ensure that the proteins identified are genuinely representative and specific for the condition investigated.",
