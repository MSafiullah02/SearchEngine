            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has led to a global health crisis, and yet our understanding of the disease pathophysiology and potential treatment options remains limited. SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs through binding and internalization of the viral spike protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell membrane. Lethal complications are caused by damage and failure of vital organs that express high levels of ACE2, including the lungs, the heart and the kidneys. Here, we established a high-throughput drug screening strategy to identify therapeutic candidates that reduce ACE2 levels in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived cardiac cells. Drug target analysis of validated hit compounds, including 5 alpha reductase inhibitors, revealed androgen signaling as a key modulator of ACE2 levels. Treatment with the 5 alpha reductase inhibitor dutasteride reduced ACE2 levels and internalization of recombinant spike receptor binding domain (Spike-RBD) in hESC-derived cardiac cells and human alveolar epithelial cells. Finally, clinical data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients demonstrated that abnormal androgen states are significantly associated with severe disease complications and cardiac injury as measured by blood troponin T levels. These findings provide important insights on the mechanism of increased disease susceptibility in male COVID-19 patients and identify androgen receptor inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy.",

The spike (S) protein, which is responsible for the characteristic crown-like shape of coronaviruses, facilitates the binding of the virus to its receptors on the cell membrane 5, 6 . ACE2 has been identified as the main receptor utilized by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 to enter cells 7 . Additionally, recent findings using human and animal cell lines have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 relies on the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming prior to ACE2 facilitated internalization 6 . Research after the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic shows that knockingout ACE2 results in markedly decreased viral entry in lungs of mice infected with the virus 8 . Recently, Tucker et. al. showed expression of ACE2 in human adult cardiac cells, such as cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle. Interestingly, ACE2 levels in cardiomyocytes are found to be increased in patients with failing hearts, further linking the expression profile of ACE2 to clinical findings in COVID-19 patients 9 . In this study, we identified pharmacological strategies to reduce the levels of ACE2 in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived cardiac cells in order to facilitate therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing viral entry, thereby mitigating the multi-organ complications induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

In fact, 70% of the patients on ventilators in the ICU were found to be males 1 . To explore the possible role of androgen signaling on poor disease outcomes in male COVID-19 patients, we conducted a study on two independent cohorts of patients tested for SARS-CoV-2. Among males, we found a significant positive association between free androgen index and the risk of severe COVID-19 and between prostatic disease as a surrogate for androgen dysregulation and abnormal blood troponin T levels. Our data provide a potential mechanistic link between clinical observations and pathways involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis.",

The high-quality cell-based measurements and the inherent diversity of the FDA library provided a unique opportunity to develop a virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) approach that allowed for rapid in silico screening and costeffective identification of compounds that can elicit the desired biological response.

We then variance normalized the model predictions to determine their associated z-scores. We selected the compounds with a z-score smaller than -4 as \"hit\" compounds. To visualize these hits, we used Morgan fingerprints to generate molecular features for all in vitro and in silico tested compounds and visualized their relationship in a 2-dimensional space using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) ( Figure  1F ). We then used K-means clustering to categorize in silico and in vitro hits and grouped them into 15 coarse-grained clusters based on their molecular features ( Figure 1G ). We observed a consistent coclustering of the FDA-approved drugs that are known to have structural similarities, such as the cluster containing finasteride and dutasteride, confirming the utility of these clustering representations. Taken together, this integrative cell-based and in silico screening strategy enabled the identification and nomination of novel drug-like compounds with similar structure and potentially higher potency as compared to the FDA-approved drugs utilized in the in vitro screen.",

Interestingly, target proteins associated with compounds that reduce ACE2 expression were associated with various GO terms related to peptidase activity and steroid metabolic processes ( Figure 2D ). These pathways were then validated with the SEA predicted protein targets from the in silico library screen. Interestingly, hit compounds identified in the in silico screen also showed enrichment for targets involved in steroid hormone activity, steroid metabolic processes, and peptidase activity ( Figure 2E ). Given the strong clinical evidence on COVID-19 disproportionately affecting men, the well-established role of peptidase in modulating ACE2 and SARS-Co-V-2 co-receptors, and the possible link between ACE2 expression and sex hormones, we sought to uncover the specific drug-protein interactions driving enrichment of steroid and peptidase pathways. We first mapped the drug-protein interactions for the full list of predicted targets and compounds with z-score<-1.5 ( Figure 3A ). This revealed a list of 48 compounds with significant interactions with target proteins (Supplementary Figure 6 ). Next we created drug-protein matrices on proteins in \"steroid metabolic process\" and \"serine-type peptidase\" activity GO terms to map the interaction of drugs with corresponding targets (Supplementary Figure 7A,B) . This analysis highlighted the interaction of several drugs including ketoconazole, spironolactone, finasteride and dutasteride with androgen signaling modulators such as SRD5A1 and SHBG ( Figure 3A , Supplementary Figure 7A ,B) whereas other drugs from the in vitro screen, such as camostat mesilate, sotagliflozin, and guanabenz acetate, are specific to the serine-type peptidase activity pathway (Supplementary Figure 7B ).",

The genes with AR binding to this 5kb downstream or upstream of transcription start sites (TSS) were selected as direct AR-bound targets. We next used a transcriptomics dataset generated using RNAi-mediated knockdown of AR 30 and compared gene expression changes in response to AR knockdown. We divided log-fold expression changes into nine equally populated bins, which were also shown along with the patterns of AR enrichment and depletion at the corresponding TSS across the data ( Figure 4A ). This analysis identified ACE2, and other SARS-CoV-2 co-receptors TMPRSS2 and Furin as direct transcriptional targets that are downregulated in response to AR knockdown ( Figure 4A ). Furthermore, after exposing hESC-derived cardiac cells to the drug candidates that are known to inhibit AR signaling, we observed significant reductions in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein levels ( Figure 4B ,C). Dutasteride and spironolactone, the top candidates that modulate AR signaling, were both able to reduce ACE2 levels in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure 9 A,B). Together, these results indicate that AR signaling regulates expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors.",

To determine whether androgen plays a role in COVID-19 disease manifestation, we explored the effect of disorders related to androgen imbalance on COVID-19 induced cardiac injury, measured by elevated troponin T levels. We also included the previously described risk factors associated with organ failure 32 such as age, BMI, diabetes and hypertension in our data collection ( Figure 5A ). In the de-identified aggregate data from Yale New Haven Hospital, 1577 individuals tested positive for COVID-19 and had serum troponin T measured during the same encounter. There was a larger number of males with abnormal serum troponin T levels in both selected age groups (Supplementary Figure  10A ). Association analysis in the COVID-19 patients showed that most risk factors are correlated with abnormal levels of troponin T in serum, but the risk factors also correlate with each other (Supplementary Figure 10B ). To account for associations between individual risk factors, we tested multiple multi-variate models (as described in the methods section). In our final model, prostatic disease increased the odds of having abnormal troponin T by 50.5% (OR=1.505, 95% CI, p-value 0.046), independent of the other risk factors ( Figure 5B ).",

Our study identifies a link between male sex hormone signaling and regulation of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and co-receptor TMPRSS2 providing a potential explanation for these observations. Our results demonstrate that inhibitors of 5 alpha reductases, which dampen androgen signaling, can reduce ACE2 levels and thereby decrease internalization of the viral spike-RBD. These drugs, commonly prescribed for prostatic disorders, have good safety profiles and show repurposing potential for the treatment of COVID-19.",

Taking advantage of directed hESC differentiation, we generated scalable cultures of disease-relevant human cardiac cells and performed high-throughput screening to identify drugs that regulate ACE2 expression in these cell types. These experiments underscore the potential of hESC-derived cardiac cells for in-depth investigation of cell-type specific processes and offer a framework for rapid identification and validation of therapeutically-relevant compounds.

We used Morgan fingerprints to represent the chemical features of each compound in the screened FDA-approved library (CircularFingerprint function available in DeepChem with SMILES as input). We tested a random forest regressor (scikit-learn), which failed to perform adequately (validation R 2 score ~0). We then used an XGBoost model (XGBRegressor) with the following parameters: colsample_bytree = 0.3, learning_rate = 0.1, max_depth = 5, alpha = 10, n_estimators = 10. While the model performance improved (correlation coefficient of 0.1), it was largely driven by positive z-score values and the prediction of the negative side was substantially less reliable. We then tested graph convolutional neural networks after featurizing the molecules using ConvMolFeaturizer (DeepChem) and testing a default model architecture with dropout set to 0.2. This initial model was promising with an R of 0.05; therefore, we performed a systematic hyperparameter tuning using a grad search on the size of the graph convolutional and dense layers, as well as dropout rates. The best-performing model contained two graph convolutional (size 64) and dropout of 0.5 (and uncertainty set to true) and achieved an R of 0.1. We also tested messagepassing models (MPNN) in a similar fashion; however, the performance was not improved. Therefore to further boost the performance of the models, we first focused on improving the dataset itself. In addition to the ACE2 in vitro screening data, we included data from five additional screens with the same library, added an inverse normal transformation when appropriate, and performed a multi-task learning. These modifications allowed the model to generalize better and learn faster with better R scores (this allowed us to reduce the dropout to 0.25). Second, instead of using a single model, we utilized a bagging ensemble model instead, where five models were trained on random samplings (with replacement) of training data. This ensemble model achieved an R of >0.2 on the validation dataset. We then continued training while the Pearson coefficient for validation set remained above 0.2 (early stopping). Finally, we tested this final ensemble model on the test dataset, which achieved a similar R=0.22 (p-value 0.01).",

Genes were ordered based on their combined z-score from left to right and divided into nine equally populated bins. The enrichment and depletion pattern of various genesets is then assessed across this spectrum using mutual information. Red boxes show enrichment and blue boxes show depletion. E) Gene-set enrichment analysis for the in silico hits. Similar to (D), genes were grouped into those that are likely targeted by the identified compounds and those that are not (i.e. background). We then assessed the enrichment of each pre-compiled gene-set among the targets using iPAGE. pattern of AR target genes (i.e. genes with promoter AR binding) as a heatmap along with the mutual information value and its associated z-score. The log-fold change values were divided into equally populated bins and the enrichment of AR-bound genes in each bin was assessed using hypergeometric pvalues and colored accordingly (gold for enrichment and blue for depletion; red and blue borders mark bins that are statistically significant. B-C) Effect of candidate androgen signaling inhibitors on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 levels on the surface of cardiac cells with their corresponding Immunofluorescence images. D-G) Differential effect of Dutasteride (potent inhibitor of Testosterone to DHT conversion) and DHT on the membrane ACE2 levels and spike-RBD protein entry to cardiomyocytes (D-E) and Pulmonary epithelial cells (F-G) with their corresponding immunofluorescence images.
