The layout of the paper is as follows: the research problem, research question and the Women in IT survey are discussed in Sect. 2. Literature on culture and the influence of culture on career decisions for women are discussed in Sect. 3. The Women in IT survey results are presented in Sect. 4. Conclusions and recommendations, relevant to young women wanting to choose a career in IT and future work are presented in Sect. 5.",

The gender gap particularly identifies factors that influence women. Seeing women working in the technical field and female IT role models also influences girls when deciding on their careers [32]. It is important for children to have access to and use computers at home and in schools [21]. Parental support is another influential factor on whether women choose a technology related major.

Games are not being used as a tool to raise interest in technology in females [1]. The use of video games was noted by Main and Schimpf [23] as a contributing factor to computer biases. Access to games arouses technical interest, improves skills, such as design and rotational abilities and thus serves as an entry to the IT field and is a promoter of interest as it develops skills such as graphic design in participants.",

These factors may be internal to the individual, such as interests or skills, or external, such as influences by families, the economy, or even certain policies [18]. An important theory that relates to career choices is the theory of reasoned action (TRA) by Azjen and Fishbein [6], which states that an individual\u2019s behavioural intention is influenced by his/her own attitude and the social subjective norms prevalent in their environment. This theory is derived from the expectancy theory, which indicates that motivation for career decision is the result of the individual\u2019s belief in future possible outcomes. The theory of reasoned action stresses that an individual\u2019s behaviour can be examined and predicted through the examination of their underlying basic motivation. Thus, voluntary decisions of women, such as career choices can be predicted based on their respective attitude and the influence of those in their social circle and in this case culture [18].",

Women, in general are less informed about the content of the work in IT, however they are informed about the inequalities in the field [19, 23]. The findings of this study indicate that although IT is noted as not being understood in the community (41%, n = 29), it is seen as a respectable profession in society (88%, n = 60). The Pearson correlation analysis confirmed that Culture and societal attitudes regarding an IT career exert no influence on females opting for a career in IT and that Culture and societal attitudes regarding IT career positively influence females remaining in the field of IT.",

These findings support Gathungu and Mwangi [16] that culture does influence women\u2019s career choice.
