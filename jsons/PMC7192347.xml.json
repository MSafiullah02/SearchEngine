            "text": "We are facing a global highly pathogenic novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that has\nalready infected more than 2.5 million people and caused more than 180 000\ndeath worldwide. Coronaviruses (CoV) are large enveloped RNA viruses that cause\nrespiratory disease in animals and humans, ranging from the common cold to life\nthreatening pneumonia. There are total seven types of human CoVs reported to date.\nFour out of seven CoVs cause mild upper respiratory tract infections, while two\nhuman CoVs named SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have caused major outbreaks. The recent\noutbreak of a novel coronavirus, named as SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV/COVID-19, has been\nrecently declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, as it has spread\nto more than 200 countries and territories. Not only do SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV\nshare a high level of DNA sequence similarities, but also both of them exploit the\nsame angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, binding to which facilitate\nthe virus entry target cells. Due to the presence of similar proteins on the\nsurface of the virus and exploitation of the same host cell receptor, it was\nanticipated that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV infects the host cell could\nalso be same for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV virus not only was found inside brain cells\nbut also was capable of infecting it, highlighting the neurotropic properties of\nthis virus.1 Neuroinvasive and neurotropism properties of CoVs\nwere demonstrated for other CoVs such as MERS-CoV, hCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and\nhepatitis virus. However, given the high genetic sequence similarity between\nSARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, as well as respiratory syndrome in other CoVs, it remains\nto be determined if respiratory failure seen in COVID-19 patients is due to\npotential neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2.",

For instance, intestinal cells and\nendothelial cells are not infected despite expression of ACE-2 while hepatocytes\nwith undetectable levels could be infected by SARS-CoV. On the contrary, SARS-CoV\nand MERS-CoV infection was observed in the brain despite very low expression of\nACE-2. Transgenic mice harboring hACE-2 have demonstrated that SARS-CoV enters the\nbrain possibly via the olfactory bulb, and then from there it spreads to other\nspecific parts of brain such as the thalamus and brainstem through olfactory\nnerves. Similarly, transgenic mice expressing hDPP4 were used to show that\nMERS-CoV enters the brain through the same route and affects the thalamus and\nbrainstem. Importantly, at low dose, MERS-CoV was infectious only in the brain but\nnot in the lung and this infection in the brain was correlated with high mortality\nobserved in a mouse model of MARS-CoV. All these studies indicate that the\nbrainstem is one of the highly infected areas of the brain by SARS-CoV or\nMERS-CoV.",

            "text": "Interestingly, two sets of neuronal networks are present within the brainstem that\nare crucial for generation of respiratory rhythm.2 The\npre-B\u00f6tzinger complex (PBC) functions as the primary respiratory\noscillator, and it has been proposed as a kernel of respiration, while the\nretrotrapezoid nucleus/parafacial respiratory group (RTN/pFRG) is a secondary\noscillator. We have shown that disruption of the PBC in the existence of a normal\nRTN/pFRG cause lethality due to respiratory failure.3 Overall,\nthe PBC plays a central role in rhythmogenesis along with possible other\nrespiratory networks present in the brainstem. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 may\nshut down the PBC and in turn breathing by infecting and destroying the PBC in the\nbrainstem. A destroyed respiratory center in the brainstem could be accountable\nfor respiratory breakdown in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, respiratory failure\nrelated death might be due to the collapse of the respiratory center in the\nbrainstem, which is usually not very apparent during diagnosis. Although this\nunderlined hypothesis needs to be validated for SARS-CoV-2, a recent study has\nfound that almost 50% of COVID-19 patients also had many neurological problems\nincluding epilepsy, stroke, and hemorrhage.",

From there, it would spread to various parts of\nthe brain by a synapse connected route and trans-synaptic transfer and infects the\nPBC in the brainstem, the respiratory center of the brain that controls the lungs,\nshutting down breathing and causing potential death in a similar manner what has\nbeen proposed by SARS-CoV.4,5 In fact, from the appearance of first symptoms of\ninfection with SARS-CoV-2 to hospitalization, usually it takes a week, which is\nenough for this virus to enter the brain and attack the PBC to collapse the\nrespiratory center of patients. Transgenic mice expressing hACE-2 have also shown\nthat SARS-CoV enters the brains through neurons present in the nose and from there\nit spreads to other parts of brain. They highlighted the dysfunctional neurons\nthat serve as the breathing center could be the major cause of death. MERS virus\nexpressing hACE2 has also indicated parallel results. Interestingly, a significant\nnumber of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in Korea, China, Italy, and Spain have\ncomplained of loss of smell. If SARS-CoV-2 uses the same pathway, then it will\ntarget the olfactory mucosa and olfactory axons, making an opening in the\ncribiform plate for it enter the subarachnoid space and project towards olfactory\nepithelium and outer layer of the olfactory bulb.6 This is a\ncontinuation of a previous report demonstrating the entry of Nipah virus into the\nCNS via the cribriform plate and olfactory bulb. Importantly, Nipas virus entry\ninto the CNS occurs concurrently with respiratory disease, rather than as a result\nof secondary infection in the lungs. Once SARS-CoV-2 reaches the olfactory bulb,\nit may target the deeper parts of the brain including the thalamus and brainstem\nby trans-synaptic transfer as described for many viral diseases (Figure 1). Infection in the respiratory center of\nthe brainstem can trigger changes that affect involuntary respiration controlled\nby the CNS. Thus, it is not only important to screen COVID-19 patients for\nneurological symptoms but also further segregate them when the symptoms appear. At\npresent, the brain is not considered as a primary or secondary cause of death from\nCOVID-19. It is important that we really focus our attention also toward the\nrespiratory center of the CNS. In the future, cerebrospinal fluid of patients at\ndifferent time points of infection and postmortem brains tissue of COVID-19\npatients should also be assessed to understand the route of entry, transneuronal\nspread, neuronal damage, and affected areas, including a detailed assessment of\nthe respiratory center of the brain.",
