            "text": "Pregnant women have a relatively immunocompromised status and physiological adaptive changes during pregnancy that could cause them to be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than the general population. (3, 4) Pregnant women are more likely to have complications following viral pneumonia and even progress to severe illness. (3, 5) There are some concerns about the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 and its effect on newborns. (6, 7) Currently, there is no reliable evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted transplacentally from mother to newborn. (4, (8) (9) (10) In mothers with COVID-19, analysis of amniotic fluid, placental tissue, umbilical cord blood and breast milk has shown no trace of SARS-CoV-2. However, this is based on a number of small studies from China in women who developed mild COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy, in which the majority were delivered via caesarean section. (2, 6, 7, 11) It is unknown whether vaginal birth or uterine contraction increases the risk of mother to child transmission. (4, 7, 11) Similarly, the effects of the virus on the foetus in the first and second trimester or in patients with moderate-to-severe infection is unknown. (2, 4, 7) In one study in Wuhan, one newborn tested positive in 36 h of life -there is uncertainty if the newborn acquired the disease postnatally or perinatally. (12) Infection with COVID-19 can range from asymptomatic to severe respiratory distress in newborns and children, though the evidence is still very limited. (8, 13) Fortunately, children without underlying comorbidities seem to have milder disease.(8) Respiratory distress, vomiting feeds, cough and fever were present in newborns diagnosed with COVID-19.(8) Perinatal COVID-19 infection may have adverse effects on newborns, causing problems such as foetal distress and premature labour.(6) Close cooperation between obstetric and neonatal departments is encouraged in order to deliver well-prepared and safe resuscitation for newborns in the delivery room. (6) The Neonatal Unit at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital (CMJAH) consists of a 14-bed combined Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (PNICU), a 35-bed high-care ward (which offers Continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) but not mechanical ventilation), a 40-bed low-care ward (including Kangaroo Mother Care) and a labour ward nursery with 10 beds. The hospital has approximately 9000 births annually and is the referral centre for a number of other regional hospitals, midwife-obstetric units and local clinics. CMJAH has also been identified as one of the hospitals designated for managing COVID-19 cases. (14) As such it is important that all areas in the labour ward, caesarean-section theatre and neonatal unit are adequately prepared. This article discusses the implementation of international and local recommendations as well as any additional actions the Neonatal Unit has undertaken in preparedness for COVID-19.",

These newborns should be carefully examined by neonatologists and monitored closely, and careful attention should be paid to prevent infection in these newborns.(4,6-8,10,13) Newborns should be transferred in a closed transport incubator, (20, 22, 24) and all procedures and investigations should be carried out in a single room with a minimal number of staff present. (6, 22, 25) Potentially aerosol generating procedures (such as taking nasal swabs, intubating or suctioning) should be accompanied by full PPE and the necessary precautions. (17, 19) Mother and newborn (including testing, separation and feeding) Testing all admitted newborns for COVID-19 is not necessary. (25) According to the South African Department of Health guidelines, well newborns should not be tested for COVID-19, irrespective of maternal COVID-19 result. (24) If the newborn is well and the mother can care for the newborn, the newborn should room-in with the mother. (26) In the event that the mother is unable to care for the well newborn, the newborn should await discharge in a closed incubator and be discharged as soon as possible to a suitable caregiver. (21, 23, 24) Newborns of COVID-19 positive mothers who require admission to the neonatal unit should be tested immediately and considered infectious for at least 14 days after symptom resolution. The newborn should be isolated in a single room for the duration, nursed with full precautions, and treated for any viral respiratory infection as well as other pathology. (18, 21, 22, 24) While this is ideal, each clinical setting should consider its capacity and adopt a flexible and variable approach to admitting patients such as designated isolation areas or cohorting of patients. (21, 25) COVID-19 positive mothers and fathers are not allowed to visit their newborn in the neonatal unit.(20-24) While we understand that this will be difficult for new parents, early identification and isolation are imperative for COVID-19 control. (9) There is currently no evidence to suggest that breastmilk from infected mothers poses a risk of infection towards the newborn.(3,7,23) Hence, breastfeeding (or expressed breastmilk), donor breastmilk (if the mother is unable to express) or formula feeding is permissible. (21, 26) Current national maternal and neonatal guidelines advise that well newborns can be breastfed by mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 if the mother is well enough to do so. (24) Mothers should be advised regarding hand washing and wearing a mask while handling the newborn. (20, 21, 24, 26) If the newborn is admitted, then the newborn should not have any visitors but feeding is encouraged with expressed breastmilk with precautions. (21, 24) Guidelines may be further updated as new evidence emerges.",

At the same time, health-care workers may be under tremendous psychological pressure due to overwork, shortage of medical resources, patients' poor outcomes or other stressful experiences.(18) Already, nurses have been hesitant to nurse a child in the PNICU with suspected COVID-19 due to fear of becoming infected themselves and efficacy of PPE. Staff have been encouraged to take care of themselves mentally and physically and should seek psychological support via staff clinics or elsewhere.",

While staff anxiety levels are high (regarding nursing potential cases, transmission to health-care workers and availability of PPE), clear protocols and communication of the protocols is vital in allaying fears. A rational approach to suspected cases and infection control in-line with local and international guidelines, as well as ongoing education, should diminish anxiety amongst health-care workers. (27) Ongoing refinement of protocols and procedures is warranted as the extent of the pandemic in our setting unfolds and the available literature changes. These should happen concurrently while still delivering appropriate care to the current and future patients within the unit. South Africa is a low-to-middle income country, and the lack of resources available means we cannot increase our capacity, staffing numbers or available equipment. Since our \"usual\" patient load will not decrease, we must be as prepared, adaptable and efficient as possible.",
