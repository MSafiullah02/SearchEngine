CD1 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). The deafwaddler mice have a G to A transition mutation in Atp2b2, the gene encoding PMCA2 (27, 28). The dfw-2J mice have a two-nucleotide deletion that results in a frameshift mutation with a premature stop codon at position 471 (28). Wild-type C3H mice served as controls for the dfw mice, whereas wild-type BALB/c mice were controls for the dfw-2J mice. Female mice of each genotype were mated at 8 wk of age and were milked on d 12 of lactation as previously described (22). The no. 4 inguinal mammary glands were harvested for RNA isolation.",

            "text": "To elucidate the molecular pathway by which the CaR regulates calcium transport in the mammary gland, we first needed to know what calcium channels or transporters were expressed during lactation. We therefore performed a genome-wide screen using Affymetrix microarray analysis of RNA from nulliparous, pregnant, lactating, and involuting mouse mammary glands to identify genes involved in calcium handling and/or transport whose expression was specifically up-regulated during lactation. Table 2 lists the genes on the array identified as calcium channels, calcium transporters, or calcium-binding proteins that were expressed at any level in the mouse mammary gland. Of these genes, Atp2b2, the gene encoding PMCA2, was most dramatically up-regulated specifically during lactation. Based on the array data, expression of Atp2b2 increased over 60-fold on d 9 of lactation compared with nulliparous controls. Two days after weaning, expression of Atp2b2 was greatly reduced. The profile of Atp2b2 (PMCA2) expression in the mouse mammary gland was confirmed by real-time QRT-PCR (Fig. 1). When normalized to the epithelial cell marker keratin 18 (K18), Atp2b2 mRNA levels were low in the mammary glands of virgin CD1 mice, began to increase in late pregnancy, rose to a peak during lactation of about 134 times higher than virgin controls, and dropped precipitously upon weaning. Therefore, PMCA2 is the predominant calcium transporter expressed within the mammary gland, and its profile of expression is typical of genes involved in milk production (32).",

There are four possible splicing options at this site (20), which depend on the inclusion of different combinations of three possible exons. The 2w isoform includes all three alternative exons, the 2x variant includes only the third exon, the 2y includes only the first two exons, and the 2z variant excludes all three of these exons (20). We modified previously published PCR primers (10) to perform RT-PCR across splice site A of the mouse Atp2b2 transcript (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, we amplified a 377-bp product, corresponding to the PMCA2w splice variant from RNA harvested from the mouse mammary gland throughout its postnatal development. In mouse brain, where the predominant variant is PMCA2z, the smaller 244-bp amplicon was obtained. The identity of the PCR products as genuine PMCA2 splice site A variants was confirmed by sequencing (data not shown). The w variant of splice site A is sufficient to target PMCA2 to the apical plasma membrane. Accordingly, in semi-thin sections of lactating mammary glands from CD1 mice, immunofluorescent staining revealed a distinct apical localization (Fig. 2, C and D). Immunoperoxidase electron microscopy confirmed the apical membrane localization of PMCA2 in the lactating mouse mammary gland (Fig. 2E). We observed very little intracellular staining, and PMCA2 immunoreactivity was not associated with either the Golgi apparatus or with secretory vesicles.",

The dfw strain harbors a point mutation leading to a glycine to serine substitution at residue 283 that reduces the enzymatic activity of the PMCA2 protein by approximately 70% (27). The dfw-2J mutation is essentially a null mutation resulting from a 2-bp deletion that causes a frame-shift and premature stop codon (28). Homozygous mice from both strains are deaf and ataxic, hence the name deafwaddler (28). As seen in Fig. 3A, by QRT-PCR, mammary gland PMCA2 RNA expression was reduced (over 80%) in dfw-2J/dfw-2J mice compared with BALB/c controls. Dfw-2J/+ mice have approximately half of the PMCA2 expression seen in BALB/c controls. In contrast, expression of PMCA2 mRNA in dfw/dfw mice was similar to its expression in C3H control mice (Fig. 3B). In parallel to RNA levels, PMCA2 protein was readily detectable in the plasma membrane fraction of BALB/c mammary glands, was 60% reduced in heterozygous mammary glands, and was undetectable in dfw-2J/dfw-2J mice by Western blotting (Fig. 3, C and E). As with mRNA levels, PMCA2 protein levels in mammary gland membrane preparations from dfw/dfw and dfw/+ mice were similar to those from C3H control mice (Fig. 3, D and F).",

EpH4 cells are immortalized, but nontransformed mouse MECs that have been used as a model of normal MECs (33). We first documented that EpH4 cells expressed the CaR (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6A, these cells also express the Atp2b2 gene. Levels of PMCA2 mRNA were highest at 0.1 mm calcium and were actually reduced at 1, 10, and 0.1 mm calcium with gadolinium. Western blotting showed that PMCA2 protein levels were unchanged by increasing the extracellular calcium concentration or by treating the cells with gadolinium (Fig. 6B).

To determine whether the CaR regulates the localization of PMCA2, we stained EpH4 cells and primary mouse MECs incubated in media with 0.1 or 1 mm calcium for PMCA2. Figure 6D shows the results for EpH4 cells; identical results were seen with MECs. At both low and high calcium concentrations, PMCA2 was located at the plasma membrane. As noted before, because exon usage at splice site A is important in the localization of PMCA2 (20), we also analyzed whether extracellular calcium exerts any effect on the splice variants of PMCA2 expressed by MECs. As seen previously with whole mammary glands (Fig. 2B), the PMCA2w splice variant was the only one expressed in mouse MECs and EpH4 cells incubated at either 0.1, 1, or 10 mm calcium (Fig. 6C).

The dose of thapsigargin used in the assay has been shown to inhibit both SERCA and SPCA activity (36\u201339). Therefore, the Ca-dependent ATPase activity we observed in the plasma membrane preparations reflects PMCA function. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, increasing the extracellular calcium concentration from 0.1 to 1 or 10 mm significantly increased Ca-ATPase activity in both primary MECs and EpH4 cells. Ca-ATPase activity also increased significantly in response to gadolinium, a CaR agonist (25), suggesting that the CaR is responsible for the extracellular calcium-induced increase in Ca-ATPase activity. We next sought to confirm that the Ca-ATPase activity that we measured in the plasma membranes of mammary cells was due to PMCA2 by knocking down its expression with oligonucleotide siRNAs. We were able to transfect EpH4 cells with fluorescently labeled siRNAs at a high efficiency (Fig. 7C). However, we could not efficiently transfect primary cultures of mouse MECs with siRNAs. Therefore, subsequent knockdown experiments were performed only in EpH4 cells. Figure 7D shows that in cells transfected with siRNAs specific for PMCA2, we were able to reduce the level of its mRNA expression by 70% relative to the expression of PMCA2 mRNA in EpH4 cells transfected with nonspecific control siRNAs. In those EpH4 cells with reduced PMCA2 expression, Ca-ATPase activity was reduced by 75% compared with the control-transfected cells with normal levels of PMCA2 mRNA (Fig. 7E). These results indicate that most of the Ca-ATPase activity that we measured in EpH4 cells was, indeed, due to PMCA2. To confirm that the CaR mediated the regulation of PMCA2 activity by extracellular calcium in these cells, we also employed siRNAs specific to the CaR to knock down its expression by 80% (Fig. 7D). This reduction in CaR expression did not affect basal PMCA activity, but it completely abrogated the expected increase in Ca-ATPase activity in response to a shift from 0.1 to 1.0 mm extracellular calcium (Fig. 7F). In contrast, cells transfected with nonspecific control siRNAs demonstrated a significant increase in PMCA activity in response to raising extracellular calcium to 1.0 mm. For the siRNA experiments, similar results were obtained with more than one siRNA oligo, making off-target effects unlikely. In the aggregate, these results strongly suggest that activation of the CaR increases PMCA2 activity in MECs.",

We found PMCA2 to be the most prominently expressed calcium transporter in the lactating mammary gland. Little PMCA2 is expressed in the nulliparous mammary gland, but mRNA levels increase by over 100-fold in the lactating gland, matching the timing for the greatly increased demand for calcium transport capacity. The mammary gland expresses only PMCA2w splice variants, which are predicted to traffic to the apical rather than the basolateral membranes of MECs. We confirmed the apical location of PMCA2 by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, suggesting that calcium is actively pumped across the apical membrane. PMCA2 is clearly necessary for calcium transport into milk, because loss-of-function mutations in the Atp2b2 gene in the two deaf-waddler strains deplete milk calcium. Complete loss of function of PMCA2 in the Dfw-2J strain causes a 70% reduction in calcium content. Finally, we show that activation of the CaR on MECs activates PMCA2 activity, providing a mechanistic framework to explain our previous observations that increased extracellular calcium concentrations stimulate transepithelial calcium transport by MECs.",

            "text": "Our data regarding PMCA2 confirm and extend prior results from Reinhardt, Horst, and colleagues (10\u201313). In a survey of the calcium-ATPases expressed in the lactating mammary gland, they also documented up-regulation of PMCA2 (10, 12), and in a study of a PMCA2\u2212/\u2212 mouse strain created by homologous recombination, they observed a 60% reduction in milk calcium concentration (13). Given their results, the results of our genomic survey and our finding of a reduction in milk calcium in two additional, independent genetic models of loss of PMCA2 function, it can be concluded with some certainty that PMCA2 is responsible for transporting the majority of calcium found in milk. Furthermore, our immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy studies clearly establish that PMCA2 is found in the apical membrane of mammary cells. Importantly, we did not find evidence for significant amounts of PMCA2 concentrated within the Golgi or secretory vesicle membranes. Therefore, most of the calcium entering milk must do so directly from the cytoplasm across the apical membrane and not through the secretory pathway as previously believed (1, 40). Some calcium does enter the Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and secretory vesicles to participate in casein micelle formation, because SERCAs and SPCAs are expressed within the lactating gland (10, 12), and deletion of PMCA2 does not eliminate all calcium transport in either the PMCA2\u2212/\u2212 (13) or Dfw-2J mice. However, transit of calcium through the secretory pathway is quantitatively less important than apical transport, and we suggest a new working model of calcium transport into milk as illustrated in Fig. 8. The nature of the calcium entry thorough the basolateral membrane remains unclear, although as mentioned before, prior evidence implicates a stretch-activated calcium channel (2, 3). Once within the cytoplasm, some calcium enters the Golgi and/or secretory vesicles to permit casein micelle formation, but the majority of calcium is shuttled through the cytoplasm to the apical surface where it is extruded into milk by PMCA2 and becomes associated with casein already secreted into the alveolar lumen.",

            "text": "The presence of apical transport in MECs suggests that calcium handling by the mammary gland is similar to calcium transport in other sites such as salivary glands, the duodenum, and the distal nephron (41\u201343). In all three, calcium is thought to enter the cells through epithelial calcium channels (TRPV5 or TRPV6), to transit through the cytoplasm bound to calbindins, and to exit on the opposite side through the actions of PMCAs and a Na/Ca exchanger (NCX1) (41). Although calcium extrusion in MECs relies on PMCA2 activity, it appears to deviate from these other sites in several important ways. First, expression of the epithelial calcium entry transporters (TRPV5 and TRPV6) is low during lactation (VanHouten, J. N., and J. J. Wysolmerski, unpublished data) excluding them as candidates for mediating calcium entry. Second, it has previously been reported that Na/Ca exchange is not important to transepithelial calcium transport in MECs (5), and expression of NCX1 (Slc8a1) did not increase during lactation in our microarray data. Finally, in the intestine, kidney, and salivary gland, calbindins serve to limit the free intracellular calcium in transit through the cytoplasm (41). However, calbindin expression in MECs does not increase during lactation (Table 2), raising the question as to how free calcium is sequestered within MECs and how it reaches PMCA2 on the apical surface. Calcium is likely removed from the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi through the actions of SERCA2, SPCA1, and SPCA2 (10, 12). In pancreatic acinar cells, it has been suggested that after being pumped from the cytoplasm by SERCAs, calcium can transit or tunnel though the endoplasmic reticulum network from the basal surface of the cell to the apical surface. In mammary cells, a similar mechanism might allow for the bulk movement of calcium from its site of entry to the apical surface in close proximity to PMCA2, without necessitating a dramatic increase in the production of calbindins or other calcium shuttle proteins (Fig. 8).",

Given the importance of PMCA2 in transporting calcium into milk, we sought to determine whether CaR signaling regulated PMCA2 expression, localization, and/or activity. Our data suggest that the CaR does not increase PMCA2 expression, nor does it alter the splicing of PMCA2 mRNA or the intracellular localization of PMCA2 protein. Rather, CaR activation achieved either with calcium or the type I calcimimetic, gadolinium, was able to simulate Ca-dependent ATPase activity in the plasma membrane of mammary cells. This activity was not caused by contaminating SERCAs or SPCAs, because it was insensitive to high concentrations of thapsigargin (36\u201339). Furthermore, knockdown of PMCA2 expression using siRNAs greatly reduced the membrane Ca-ATPase activity, confirming that it was generated by PMCA2. Therefore, PMCA2 activity is activated by increases in extracellular calcium, a response mediated by the CaR as shown by its replication with gadolinium and abolition by CaR-specific siRNAs.",

The ability of the CaR to regulate PMCA2 function may have implications for pathophysiology as well. Breast tumors have a propensity to metastasize to bone, where they are particularly difficult to eradicate. Breast cancer cells have been shown to express both the CaR and PMCA2, and data from Lee and colleagues (40, 44) suggest that PMCA function may enhance proliferation of breast cancer cell lines in culture. Thus, it is interesting to postulate that the high local calcium concentrations of the bone microenvironment may activate the CaR and stimulate PMCA2 function, which, in turn, might contribute to the growth of bone metastases. We hope a greater understanding of calcium handling by the lactating mammary gland will shed light on both the control of milk production as well as the pathophysiology of breast cancer.",

PMCA2 mRNA levels were assayed at the different developmental stages noted and were first normalized to HPRT and then to K18 expression to adjust for the changing epithelial content of the gland at the different stages of development. Data are expressed as the relative expression compared with 5-wk-old virgin mice. At the end of pregnancy on d 19, there is a large increase in epithelial PMCA2 expression. During lactation, PMCA2 expression peaks at up to 134 times its level in the mammary gland of a 5-wk-old nulliparous mouse. Within 2 d after forced weaning (done on d 12 of lactation), expression of PMCA2 has fallen almost to baseline.",

Mouse brain RNA served as a control for the PMCA2z splice variant (the brain sample was run on a different gel). PCR products were of the predicted sizes for either the w splice variant (377 bp) or the PMCA2z splice variant (244 bp), but PCR products were sequenced to confirm their identity. Throughout postnatal development, the mouse mammary gland expresses only the PMCA2w variant of splice site A. C and D, Immunofluorescent staining for PMCA2 in mammary tissue from a lactating mouse (d 12) demonstrated that it was located at the apical plasma membrane.

In addition, if 100 \u03bcm GdCl3, a CaR agonist, is added to these cells in media with 0.1 mm calcium, an increase in Ca-ATPase activity is also seen, compared with 0.1 mm calcium alone (P < 0.05 in A; P < 0.05 in B).

E, Ca-ATPase activity in the plasma membrane fraction of EpH4 cells grown at 2 mm calcium was reduced by 75% after transfection with PMCA2 siRNA compared with transfection with the control siRNA (P < 0.05, three experiments).

F, Ca-ATPase activity increased significantly when the extracellular calcium concentration was raised from 0.1 to 1 mm calcium in EpH4 cells transfected with control siRNA (P < 0.05, three experiments).

            "text": "Fig. 8.: A model of transcellular calcium transport into milk. Mechanisms leading to calcium entry through the basolateral membrane are unknown but may involve the action of a stretch-activated calcium channel. Once inside the cell, calcium is pumped into the ER by SERCAs or the Golgi by SPCAs or is bound by cytosolic calcium-binding proteins. Some calcium transits through the secretory pathway, takes part in casein micelle formation, and is secreted into milk by exocytosis. However, the majority of calcium moves to the apical plasma membrane where it is pumped directly into milk from the cytoplasm by PMCA2bw. Calcium may reach the apical surface of the cell by traveling through the cytoplasm bound to buffering proteins, or it may transit the endoplasmic reticulum and be released back into the cytoplasm in proximity to PMCA2bw. Once it crosses the apical membrane, calcium then equilibrates with caseins, phosphate, and citrate, so that ionized calcium represents only 10\u201330% of total milk calcium. Finally, the CaR on the basolateral membrane allows interstitial calcium levels to regulate calcium transport into milk by altering the activity of the apical PMCA2bw calcium pump.
