Severe cases of PV represent a true medical emergency (5). Since the public announcement of the COVID-19 outbreak, several concerns have been raised by dermatologists as well as pemphigus patients who take immunosuppressive drugs. These concerns include the need for proper disease control with minimal immune suppression to avoid possible fatal outcomes. It is also crucial to understand how the underlying mechanisms in COVID-19 (e.g. cytokine release storm leading to interstitial pulmonary inflammation, extensive lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome) (6) could affect those auto-immune diseases such as pemphigus.",

Existing clinical data have not confirmed the beneficial effect of corticosteroids in treatment of respiratory infections due to SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV (12). The observational studies had reported increased mortality and secondary infection rates in influenza, impaired clearance of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and complications of corticosteroid therapy (e.g. diabetes, avascular necrosis, and steroid-induced psychosis) in survivors (13, 14). Therefore, not only does the role of steroids in the treatment of acute lung injury in these viral infections remain controversial, but also this treatment may be harmful in patients with 2019-nCoV infection (12, 15).",

Early treatment with rituximab has resulted in higher remission rates, long term clinical response, lower incidence of serious adverse events and rapid prednisone tapering compared to old immunosuppressive therapies making its approval as a first-line therapy in pemphigus possible (19). Rituximab is generally considered safe in patients with pemphigus vulgaris and serious infections, while reported, are rare. Although single RTX infusions do not seem to impair memory responses against known pathogens (20), patients may exert a defective immune reaction against new pathogens and life-threatening infections, including sepsis, have been reported following RTX treatment (21). Opportunistic infections such as cytomegalovirus infection and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), although extremely rare and limited to sporadic case reports, have been reported (22, 23). The risk of reactivation of hepatitis B and C viruses as well as tuberculosis has also been reported (17). ",

Although the expression of ACE 2 (the host cell-surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2 envelope spike glycoprotein) in the brain has been proposed, the exact mechanism of CNS involvement in COVID-19 is not known, yet (25). Accordingly, since the characteristic of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified, the potential risks of treating pemphigus with rituximab should be taken into account. Special attention must be paid to close monitoring of the patients and tapering concurrent corticosteroids to minimize susceptibility to life-threatening infections. This risk should be weighed against the prominent and effective role of RTX in treatment of pemphigus and reducing the number of follow up visits (19).",

            "text": " Most guidelines suggest azathioprine (AZA) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as first-line steroid-sparing agents for treatment of pemphigus rather than other adjuvant immunosuppressants (18). Nevertheless, different variables such as age and comorbidities of the patients, dermatologist\u2019s personal experience and costs need to be considered since other drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, also show efficacy (8). It should be noted that in comparison to corticosteroid alone, these drugs mainly exert a corticosteroid-sparing effect that leads to a reduction in the risk of relapse by 29% rather than achieving remission (26). Currently, data regarding the administration of these drugs during COVD-19 are scarce and inconclusive. We recommend that these drugs only be discontinued in proven cases of COVID-19. It is noteworthy that there are reports of atypical presentation of Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) in patients who received immunosuppressive drugs; therefore, careful monitoring of patients for atypical symptoms should be taken into account (27).",
