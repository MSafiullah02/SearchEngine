The task is to divide a document into a sequence of topically coherent segments, while preserving long topic change-points (coherency) and keeping short topic segments from getting merged (saliency). Most of the existing models either fuse topic segments by keywords or focus on modeling word co-occurrence patterns without merging. They can hardly achieve both coherency and saliency since many words have high uncertainties in topic assignments due to their polysemous nature. To solve this problem, we introduce topic-specific co-occurrence of word pairs within contexts in modeling, to generate more coherent segments and alleviate the influence of irrelevant words on topic assignment. We also design an optimization algorithm to eliminate redundant items in the generated topic segments. Experimental results show that our proposal produces significant improvements in both topic coherence and topic segmentation.",

Nevertheless, the \"bag of words\" based models are unable to capture the order of topics within each document. A simple solution is to consider the physical structure [2] (e.g., sentences and paragraphs) of each document and use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) structure [4, 9, 21, 23, 24] or predefine a common canonical topic ordering to model the order of topics [8] . However, in recent decades, massive document data are continuously generated in various forms (e.g., news and postings) and from multiple modes (e.g., voice and video). The above models cannot handle these documents with no physical structure information.",

Most words can represent multiple topics, due to their polysemy. The distributional hypothesis [20] , which states that words in similar contexts have similar meanings, is one of the primary theories used to quantify the meaning of words according to their context (e.g., Word2vec [11] ). Inspired by it, we assume that the topic of each word in a document is related to its context, that is, similar contexts correspond to similar topics. Intuitively, even if a word can be assigned to multiple topics, given its context, we can assign a corresponding topic more certainly. For example, the word \"Liverpool\" can belong to a topic of sports, geography or art, etc. However, if we combine it to the words in its context (e.g., \"Liverpool\" & \"football\" or \"Liverpool\" & \"Beatles\"), the assignment is much clearer.",

Topic Keyword Model (TKM) [22] is a topic model based on keywords and their contexts. Its main weakness lies in handling short topic segments, which are likely to be absorbed by long topic segments due to their small number of keywords. Biterm Topic Model (BTM) [7] learns topics by modeling the generation of word co-occurrence patterns, which improves the sensitivity of the discovery of phrases in short text data. On the basis of the former, Bursty Biterm Topic Model (BBTM) introduces a new variable to discover bursty topics 1 [25] . These phrase-level topic modeling methods can achieve good results in discovering word co-occurrence patterns in individual short documents and require no physical structure information. However, high-frequency phrases only make up a tiny proportion of the corpus, which limits their ability to generate coherent topics in topic segmentation tasks. The main difference from our model is that they consider all distinct word pairs of each fixed-size window, while we focus on the topic-specific word pairs, which only concern the target word in the corresponding context. Copula LDA with Segmentation (SegLDA) [1] is an LDA-based model which automatically segments documents into topically coherent sequences of words. SegLDA predefines segments for each document before modeling. For each word in a segment, a topic is assigned either from the segment-specific topic distribution or the document-specific topic distribution. These distributions differentiate the main topics of a document from potential segment-specific topics, which improves the saliency of short segments. However, the two distributions are independent. Specifically, in the former distribution, a topic assignment depends only on the words within the segment, which leads to a loss of much context information in the original document.",

We see that, in both standard and extended datasets, NPMIs increase sharply until around L = 10 then begin to decline. Moreover, we see there is a sharp decline in the extended datasets when L > 15. This might be because of their more complex topic structures and longer window sizes are more likely to contain irrelevant content. Therefore, we set L = 10 in the rest of our experiments. The results of NPMIs (with K = 50, 100, 200) for all baseline models are shown in Fig. 3(c-h) . We see that C-LDA shows the best results on all six datasets and more significant improvements in data sets with more complex topic structures (Wici+, Wile+, Cell+), which proves the validity of our model for generating coherent topics. A possible reason is that C-LDA combines the frequency of context word pairs for each topic in modeling, while the other models (such as TKM) either consider only the words frequency in each topic or the frequency of all word pairs in individual documents (such as BTM). Moreover, semantic expressions in a document are usually coherent and segmented, e.g., paragraphs and sections, thus, considering the context in a topic assignment can clarify the semantics of the word, so as to reduce the risk of splitting a coherent semantic segment.",

Therefore, its effect on the topic coherency is achieved by increasing the joint probability of each word pair and topics. The high frequent word pairs in a corpus are of high joint probabilities. However, in a corpus, the majority are ordinary words but not word pairs, and their topic assignments are still of high uncertainty. Besides, the computation of all distinct word pairs significantly increases its training time. TKM improves the coherency of topic segmentation by considering the influence of keywords on the topic assignment of surrounding words and cost the least time. However, short topic segments with insufficient keywords are likely to be absorbed by long topic segments, which is a possible reason of its low performance. In some cases of insufficient topic number (K = 50), SegLDA outperforms other methods. However, as K increased from 50 to 100, its performance growth is inferior to C-LDA. For SegLDA, the topics for words in a segment can be assigned from the segment-specific topic distribution, which improves the saliency of topic segments. However, assigning topics without considering the original document can lead to a loss of context information and degrade the accuracy of topic modeling. That is, a word is possibly assigned to an incorrect topic even if it is not absorbed by others. C-LDA considers both the contextual word pairs and topic distribution. Based on the reorganized topic distribution CTD, it reduces the uncertainty of the topic assignment and increases the joint probability of consecutive words sharing the same topic at the expense of increasing time consumption. Moreover, comparing the results of the original and their extended datasets, we see our method has stronger robustness to more complex topic structures, which also leads to better applicability.",

When K = 100, RTM effectively improves the performance of topic segmentation. To further study the effect of RTM, we calculated the changes of PK and Win-dowDiff with different numbers K of topics (from 25 to 200). The experiments were conducted on the 3 extended datasets and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . We see the measures of both C-LDA and C-LDA-R decrease quickly with the increase in length of K until K = 100. For C-LDA, the performance starts to decrease around K = 150, while for C-LDA-R, it tends to saturate as K keeps on increasing. The improvement by RTM becomes increasingly remarkable with the increase of K, which also proves the robustness of C-LDA-R for redundant topics.",
