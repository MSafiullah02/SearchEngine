            "text": "Invading microbes are initially recognized by the host cell's innate immune system via germ line-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs recognize conserved pathogen-specific molecular signatures such as viral nucleic acids and fungal and bacterial cell-wall components, which are termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Because activation of the innate immune system triggered by PRR recognition is a critical host defense mechanism, many infectious pathogens have developed the ability to suppress PRR-mediated responses in order to escape detection. The binding of PAMPs to PRRs initiates a signal transduction cascade culminating in the induction of innate immune responses through the production of inflammatory cytokines, type I interferon (IFN), and other mediators. Cytokines transmit a signal to neighboring cells that induce the expression of an array of antiviral and antibacterial genes. These factors prevent pathogen replication by binding viral or bacterial components or by impairing host cell protein synthesis. In addition to triggering immediate host defensive responses, cytokines also prime and orchestrate antigen-specific adaptive immune responses (Kawai and Akira, 2011; Rathinam and Fitzgerald, 2011; Wu and Chen, 2014).",

Mammals have several distinct classes of nucleic acid-recognizing PRRs, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I (retinoic-acid inducible gene I)-like receptors (RLRs), AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2)-like receptors (ALRs), and intracellular DNA sensors such as cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). These receptors are classified according to their cellular localizations, the types of nucleic acids they recognize, and the specific signaling pathways that they activate. For instance, TLRs localize on plasma membrane or endocytic membrane and recognize extracellular nucleic acids, whereas other nucleic acid-recognizing PRRs are cytosolic DNA and RNA sensors; TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR13, and RLRs recognize RNA, and TLR9 and DNA sensors recognize DNA; TLRs, RLRs, and DNA sensors induce the production of type I IFN and inflammatory cytokines, whereas ALRs induce the activation of the inflammasome and produce IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Other than PRRs, several interferon stimulatory genes (ISGs) also bind to pathogen-derived nucleic acids to restrict viral and bacterial replication and prevent the spread of infection to other cells.",

Inappropriate or prolonged detection of endogenous nucleic acids underlies many autoimmune diseases. Therefore, host cells have innate mechanisms to protect them from unwanted contact with endogenous (self) nucleic acids. These mechanisms can be largely subdivided into three categories: the cellular localization of PRRs, nucleic acid modifications, and the degradation of unnecessary nucleic acids.",

RIG-I binds to blunt ends of dsRNA displaying 5\u2032-diphosphate and 5\u2032-triphosphate moieties and to at least 10\u201319 bp of the adjacent dsRNA (Hornung et al., 2006; Schlee et al., 2009). RIG-I binds to the 5\u2032 terminus of dsRNA as a monomer in the absence of ATP and forms filamentous oligomers near the dsRNA end in a ATP-dependent manner (Peisley et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014). In contrast, individual molecules of MDA5 bind dsRNA internally in a highly cooperative manner and form long filaments around dsRNA in the absence of ATP (Berke et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2013). These data support the theory that RIG-I recognizes short dsRNAs whereas MDA5 preferentially binds longer dsRNAs. In the absence of dsRNAs, the CARDs of RIG-I and MDA5 interact with their helicase domain, forming an inhibitory complex (Kowalinski et al., 2011). Upon dsRNA recognition, RIG-I and MDA5 form filaments along dsRNA and their CARDs bind to the CARD of the adaptor protein interferon-\u03b2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1, also known as mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein). IPS-1 oligomerizes upon RIG-I and MDA5 binding and activates the downstream type I IFN pathway (Hou et al., 2011).",

In contrast, picornaviruses, including encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), Mengo virus, and Theiler's virus, are recognized by MDA5. Dengue virus and West Nile viruses (WNV) are recognized by both RIG-I and MDA5 (Fredericksen et al., 2008; Gitlin et al., 2006; Loo et al., 2008; Rehwinkel et al., 2010). In addition to RNA viruses, RIG-I is involved in the recognition of DNA viruses including herpes simplex virus (HSV) and adenovirus (Chiu et al., 2009; Rasmussen et al., 2009). Furthermore, RIG-I binds short dsRNA intermediates containing a 5\u2032-triphosphate group transcribed by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase III (Pol III) to induce IFN\u03b2 (Ablasser et al., 2009; Chiu et al., 2009).

The HIN-200 domain contains a oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold (OB fold), which is a common DNA-binding motif. Although only 4 PYHIN genes are present in humans, 13 are encoded in mice. AIM2 is the only ALR that is conserved between humans and mice. The AIM2 ALR acts as a cytosolic dsDNA sensor that oligomerizes on cytosolic foreign dsDNA and nucleates the polymerization of ASC (adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein) to form a caspase-1 activating inflammasome, a filamentous supramolecular signaling platform that is required to instigate innate immune responses. Activated caspase-1 then cleaves pro-IL-1\u03b2 or pro-IL-18 enabling the release of the mature active cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 (Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2009; Hornung et al., 2009; Roberts et al., 2009). AIM2 also has a crucial role in the development of the innate immune response against pathogen infections that include Francisella tularensis (Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2010), HSV-1 (Maruzuru et al., 2018) and human papillomavirus (Reinholz et al., 2013). IFI16 is also a member of the ALR family. It is able to sense pathogenic DNA in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and recognizes DNA from viruses including human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) (Monroe et al., 2014) and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) (Kerur et al., 2011).",

During virus infection and expansion, cGAS-synthesized cGAMP can be packaged into viral particles and extracellular vesicles. The viral particles then deliver cGAMP to target cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). This triggers innate immunity and antiviral defenses (Gentili et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016).",

As already discussed, RIG-I and MDA5 are well-known RNA sensors; however, these factors are also key ISGs that stimulate antiviral responses against hepatitis C virus (HCV), WNV, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV). It has been proposed that RIG-1 and MDA5 inhibit viral replication by binding to the viral RNA genome (Schoggins et al., 2011). In addition, the RNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR), the tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) family protein, oligoadenylate synthase (OAS), and the Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10) protein are also known to bind to pathogenic or endogenous RNA. PKR is activated by RNA having bulges and internal loops. Upon activation, PKR phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), which induces the inhibition of translation and leads to apoptosis (Zhang et al., 2001).",

MOV10 is a member of the RNA helicase superfamily-1, and is also associated with Argonaute 2 (AGO2), a component of the RNA-induced silencing complex. MOV10 was originally identified as a protein that prevents production of the endogenous Moloney murine leukemia virus infection in mice (Goodier et al., 2012; Schnieke et al., 1983). Later studies determined that MOV10 is able to reduce the infectivity of HIV-1, simian immunodeficiency virus, and murine leukemia virus (Wang et al., 2010). MOV10 is thought to multifunctional protein that MOV10 binds to polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) in nucleoprotein (NP) of IAV and inhibits IAV replication which is unnecessary for RNA helicase activity (Zhang et al., 2016a).",

            "text": "TLRs recognize many types of PAMPs, including lipids, lipoproteins, proteins, and nucleotides. The TLR family comprises 10 members (TLR1\u2013TLR10) in humans and 12 (TLR1\u2013TLR9, TLR11\u2013TLR13) in mice. TLRs are composed of an extracellular domain with leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) that mediates the recognition of PAMPs, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain that initiates downstream signaling. The TLR family can be divided into two subgroups: TLRs that localize to the cell surface and TLRs that reside in intracellular compartments such as endosomes, lysosomes, and endolysosomes. Each subgroup recognizes distinct PAMPs. For example, the nucleic acid-sensing TLRs exclusively localize intracellularly; TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR13 recognize RNA, whereas TLR9 recognizes DNA. Binding of TLR to pathogenic nucleic acids induces an association with a specific set of TIR domain-containing adaptors, such as MyD88 and TRIF, which activates the transcription factors NF-\u03baB and the interferon regulatory factor family (IRFs). Transcription factor activation then induces the production of type I IFN and inflammatory cytokines. Although different TLRs bind to distinct synthetic ligands, their sensitivity to microbial components overlaps. TLRs are highly expressed on innate immune cells such as macrophages and DCs, which are professional antigen presenting cells that produce inflammatory cytokines and type I IFN. One of these TLRs, TLR13, has recently been shown to recognize a 23S ribosomal rRNA sequence that is the binding site of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin group antibiotics (including erythromycin) in bacteria (Oldenburg et al., 2012). However, other intracellular nucleic acid sensors, such as cGAS and RLRs, are expressed in a variety of cell types including epithelial cells, macrophages and DCs. Therefore, the cooperative recognition of invaded pathogens by distinct receptors is important in triggering a robust innate immune response.",

The human genome encodes seven APOBEC3 (A3) proteins. APOBEC3G (A3G) was initially identified as a suppressor of HIV-1 infectivity (Doyle et al., 2015). During synthesis of the first (minus) retroviral DNA strand, APOBEC-catalyzed deamination of cytosine (C) residues results in the accumulation of excessive levels of uracil (U). Subsequently, Uracil (U) is recognized as thymine (T) by the viral reverse transcriptase and adenine (A)is incorporated into the newly synthesized second (plus) DNA strand rather than guanine (G). Therefore, mutation levels in HIV-1 genomes are increased following replication; the consequential augmentation of mutant functional proteins results in a decrease in viral infectivity (Doyle et al., 2015).",

Many viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm (for example, picornavirus, flavivirus, coronavirus, and poxvirus) encode their own RNA modification enzymes, including 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase. The importance of viral RNA modifications in replication has been supported by studies that the infection of viruses lacking 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity induces higher type I IFN expression, and unmodified genomic RNA was recognized by the host RNA sensor, MDA5 (Zust et al., 2011). The functional importance of 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity for the infectivity of RNA viruses was also verified by studies on dengue virus (DENV) (Zust et al., 2018), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Aouadi et al., 2017), and ronivirus (Zeng et al., 2016). These viruses also encode 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase and its disruption also causes type I IFN induction and virus elimination from the host following infection. Together, these results indicate that RNA viruses have evolved to encode their own methyltransferases that mimic host RNA methylation patterns to avoid recognition by the host's innate immune system.",

Such \u201cA-to-I editing\u201d alters the coding of RNA, as inosine is read as guanosine (G) instead of adenosine by ribosomes during translation, leading to the production of non-functional proteins. In humans, two autoimmune disorders, Dyschromatosis Symmetrica Hereditaria (DSH) and Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res Syndrome (AGS), are attributed to specific mutations that have been mapped to the Adar1 gene (Rice et al., 2012). Furthermore, Adar1 inducible knockout (KO) mice exhibit a high level of IFN production in neuronal tissues, a key characteristic of AGS. In healthy cells, ADAR1-mediated nucleotide conversions are believed to be important for the suppression of viral replication and, more importantly, endogenous RNA recognition by the RNA sensor, MDA5. Correspondingly, mutations in either MDA5 or MAVS rescue the embryonic lethal phenotype of Adar1 KO mice (Liddicoat et al., 2015; Mannion et al., 2014; Pestal et al., 2015).",

Retrotransposons are subjected to extensive A-to-I RNA editing by ADAR (Ramaswami et al., 2012). It is possible that the location of repetitive elements determines their immunogenicity. Retrotransposons located within introns do not persist in the cytosol and therefore are unable to activate MDA5. Repetitive elements in 3\u2032 UTRs, although rare, can be retained and form duplexes to activates MDA5. Editing of self-dsRNA by ADAR1 generates multiple I-U mismatches to avoid MDA5 recognition (Berke et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2013). In the absence of ADAR1 activity, long dsRNA stem loops can activate MDA5. However, A-to-I editing also alters the RNA secondary structure, which may lead to recognition by innate immune receptors (Liddicoat et al., 2015; Pestal et al., 2015). Recent data have shown that ADAR1 predominantly edits Alu elements in RNA polymerase II (pol II)-transcribed mRNAs, but not those transcribed by pol III in human cells (Chung et al., 2018), and A-to-I conversion in Alus suppresses MDA5 activation in vitro (Ahmad et al., 2018).",

Intracellular DNA is also released upon cellular stress. Chemicals such as mutagenic 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA), cisplatin, and etoposide induce cytosolic leakage of nuclear DNA, which intrinsically induces type I IFN expression through the cGAS-STING pathway (Ahn et al., 2014). Mitochondrial (mt) DNA released into the cytosol upon mitochondrial stress is sensed by cGAS (West et al., 2015). In addition, DNA released by tumor chemotherapy and radiation therapy acts as an adjuvant that activates the cGAS-STING pathway by releasing type I IFN from DCs (Deng et al., 2014; Woo et al., 2014). Such inductions of the inflammatory response are further facilitated by nucleotide binding proteins that enhance DNA incorporation into immune cells and protect it from nucleases. Inflammatory diseases in mice and humans are induced when released intracellular DNA and RNA, including endogenous retroelements and non-coding RNA, cannot be adequately cleared.",

            "text": "Various nucleotide binding proteins have been identified as factors that exacerbate inflammation. Most nucleotide binding proteins are expected to protect DNA from degradation by DNase and RNase in the extracellular fluid and facilitate its incorporation into innate immune cells. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear protein that binds to DNA and participates in processes such as transcription and repair. However, when it is released in complex with DNA in response to cell damage or inflammation, it acts as a potent inflammatory cytokine. HMGB1/DNA complexes facilitate incorporation into innate immune cells by binding to RAGE (receptor for advanced glycosylation end) on the surface of B-cells and DCs, which leads to the recruitment of TLR9 and potentiates type I IFN expression (Yanai et al., 2009). Another report has demonstrated that HMGB1 and its related family members, HMGB2 and HMGB3, bind to DNA and these complexes activate TLRs. In addition, a recent finding indicated that HMGB1 is able to induce the formation of U-turns and bends in dsDNA that nucleate cGAS dimers, leading to the formation of cGAS ladder-like networks with DNA (Andreeva et al., 2017). Another factor that can convert self-DNA into a pathogenic ligand is LL37, which is the active form of cathelicidin, an endogenous anti-microbial peptide that is produced by keratinocytes and neutrophils. LL37 has been found to bind to self-DNA released from necrotic cells in psoriatic lesional skin. The LL37-DNA complex forms condensed structures that protect self-DNA from nuclease degradation. The LL37-DNA complex is then translocated into the endocytic compartments of pDCs, inducing TLR9 activation and resulting in a sustained type I IFN response (Lande et al., 2007, Lande et al., 2011). The production of LL37 is associated with the onset of inflammatory diseases such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).",

This embryonic lethality is partially rescued in Adar1 and Mavs double mutants (Liddicoat et al., 2015; Mannion et al., 2014; Pestal et al., 2015).

Host cells have mechanisms to protect endogenous nucleic acids from unwanted contact with host PRRs. These mechanisms can be subdivided into three categories: the cellular localization of PRRs, nucleic acid modifications, and the degradation of unnecessary nucleic acids. Although retroelements, such as SINE, LINE, Alus, and retrotransposons, are derived from host cells and could potentially initiate an innate immune response via MDA5 and RIG-I recognition, the activation of ADAR1 and SAMHD1 suppresses the recognition and accumulation of these retroelements. Protection against endogenous nucleic acid recognition is also achieved by nucleic acid degradation. TREX1 degrades dsDNA in the extracellular milieu derived from host cells. In addition, DNase II localizes in the lysosome and is largely responsible for the clearance of DNA from dead cells and expelled nuclei. Self-nucleic acids may be released into the extracellular space upon cell necrosis. These are degraded by DNases and RNases before they come into contact with nucleic acid-sensing TLRs in endosomes. In addition, RNA 2\u2032-O methylation and CpG-DNA methylation in the host are other important signatures for self-nucleic acid discrimination.",

Ligand binding TLRs associate with MyD88 and/or TRIF in the cytosol. Intracellular RNA is recognized by RIG-I and MDA5, which bind to short dsRNAs and long dsRNAs, respectively. The binding of RIG-I and MDA5 to nucleic acids induces the formation of filaments that bind to mitochondria-localizing IPS-1 (MAVS). Intracellular dsDNAs bind to cGAS and produce cGAMP. cGAMP binds to STING which localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
