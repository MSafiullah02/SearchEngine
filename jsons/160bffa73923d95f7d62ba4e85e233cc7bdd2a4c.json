The virus has gone through various pathways of evolution. For understanding the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance. We present an accurate method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses using complete genomes. The method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The SNP genotypes are then measured by Jaccard distances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic. Our method serves a promising tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic viruses in their gradual and local genetic variations. The genotyping analysis shows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations. These mutations are critical for vaccine development in disease control.",

Coronavirus (CoV) belongs to the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. Coronavirus is widely spread in humans, other mammals, and birds, and can cause diseases such as the respiratory, intestinal, liver, and nervous systems. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were first identified in the mid-1960s. Seven common HCovs are CoV-229E (alpha coronavirus), CoV-NL63 (alpha coronavirus), CoV-OC43 (beta coronavirus), CoV-HKU1 (beta coronavirus), Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and current SARS-CoV-2. CoV-229E and CoV-OC43 are the cause of the common cold in adults during the mid-1960s. Disease manifestations associated with CoV-HKU1 and CoV-NL63 include the common cold and chronic pneumonia. Coronavirus-HKU1 has been predominantly reported in children in the United States but less common among adults. Three highly pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, which emerged in 2002, 2012 , and 2019, respectively, have caused severe respiratory disease and thousands of deaths worldwide (Chen, 2020) .",

The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome consists of a leader sequence, ORF1ab encoding proteins for RNA replication, and genes for non-structural proteins (nps) and structural proteins. The genomic leader sequence of about 265 bp is the unique characteristic in coronavirus replication and plays critical roles in the gene expression of coronavirus during its discontinuous sub-genomic replication (Li et al., 2005) . ORF1ab encodes replicase polyproteins required for viral RNA replication and transcription . Expression of the C-proximal portion of ORF1ab requires (-1) ribosomal frame-shifting. The first non-structural protein (nsp) encoded by ORF1ab is Papain-like proteinase (PL proteinase, nps3). Nsp3 is an essential and largest component of the replication and transcription complex. The PL proteinase in nsp3 cleaves nsps 1-3 and blocks host innate immune response, promoting cytokine expression (Serrano et al., 2009; Lei et al., 2018) . Nsp4 encoded in ORF1ab is responsible for forming double-membrane vesicle (DMV). The other nsp are 3CLPro protease (3-chymotrypsin-like proteinase, 3CLpro) and nsp6. 3CLPro protease is essential for RNA replication. The 3CLPro proteinase is accountable for processing the C-terminus of nsp4 through nsp16 in all coronaviruses (Anand et al., 2003) . Therefore, conserved structure and catalytic sites of 3CLpro may serve as attractive targets for antiviral drugs (Kim et al., 2012) . Together, nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 can induce DMV (Angelini et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes four structural proteins. The structural proteins possess much higher immunogenicity for T cell responses than the non-structural proteins (Li et al., 2008) . The structural proteins are involved in various viral processes, including virus particle formation. The structural proteins include spike (S), envelope (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleoprotein (N), which are common to all coronaviruses (Marra et al., 2003; Ruan et al., 2003) . The spike S protein is a glycoprotein, which has two domains S1 and S2. Spike protein S1 attaches the virion to the cell membrane by interacting with host receptor ACE2, initiating the infection (Wong et al., 2004) . After the internalization of the virus into the endosomes of the host cells, the S glycoprotein is induced by conformation changes. The S protein is then cleaved by cathepsin CTSL, and unmasked the fusion peptide of S2, therefore, activating membranes fusion within endosomes. Spike protein domain S2 mediates fusion of the virion and cellular membranes by acting as a class I viral fusion protein. Especially, the spike glycoprotein of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 contains a furin-like cleavage site (Coutard et al., 2020) . The furin recognition site is important for being recognized by pyrolysis and therefore, contributing to the zoonotic infection of the virus. The envelope (E) protein interacts with membrane protein M in the budding compartment of the host cell. The M protein holds dominant cellular immunogenicity (Liu et al., 2010) . Nucleoprotein (ORF9a) packages the positive-strand viral RNA genome into a helical ribonucleocapsid (RNP) during virion assembly through its interactions with the viral genome and membrane protein M (He et al., 2004) . Nucleoprotein plays an important role in enhancing the efficiency of subgenomic viral RNA transcription as well as viral replication.",

The SNP profiles demonstrate that the mutations in the envelope glycoprotein and RNA polymerases predominate.

Therefore, during the evolution of a virus, the transmissibility of the virus is usually increased, whereas the pathogenicity becomes reduced (Alizon et al., 2009) . From the SNP profiles of SARS-CoV-2 strain, high-frequency mutations predominate in the virus isolations, therefore, these high-frequency mutations probably contribute to increased transmissibility. In addition, these high-frequency mutations are associated with different critical proteins. We analyze and trace the SNP profiles from 442 SARS-CoV-2 strains which have at least 10 descendants. The result suggests a number of high-frequency mutations that are associated with different critical proteins. The results show that the SNP distribution is not random but is predominated at some positions and then have more descendants. These high-frequency mutations may confer a high transmissibility of the virus (Table 2 ).

Over the length of its 30kb genome, SARS-CoV-2 may accumulate mutations ranging from single mutation to 14 mutations (NL|EPI_ISL_413591|2020-03-02), as seen from December 2019 to March 23, 2020. Therefore, we may estimate that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has reached 14 generations since its first infection to humans in December 2019.",

Determining the origin and monitoring the transmission pattern of the pathogenic agents are critical to controlling the outbreak. In this work, the SNP genotyping of SARS-CoV-2 was developed by adapting fast MSA of the complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and SNP analytics using the directed Jaccard distance of the SNP profiles. The genotyping analysis provides insights on the frequent mutations that confer fast transmissibility of the virus. The major mutations are in the critical proteins, including the S protein, RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein. Therefore, these high-frequency SNP mutation sites must be considered when designing a vaccine for preventing the infection of SARS-CoV-2. ",

The countries and territories, which are infected by SARS-CoV-2 and share the complete genomes of SARS-COV-2, are Australia (AU), Belgium (BE), Brazil (BR), Canada (CA), Chile (CL), China (CN), Czech Republic (CZ), Denmark (DK), England (UK), Finland (FI), France (FR), Georgia (GE), Germany (DE), Hong Kong (HK), Hungary (HU), India (IN), Ireland (IE), Italy (IT), Japan (JP), Korea (KR), Kuwait (KW), Mexico (MX), Netherlands (NL), New Zealand (NZ), Scotland (UK), Singapore (SG), Switzerland CH), Sweden(SE), Taiwan (TW), Thailand (TH), United Kingdom (UK), Unites States (US), and Vietnam (VN). The complete genome sequences are aligned with the reference genome of SARS-CoV-2 by MSA tool Clustal Omega using the default parameters (Sievers and Higgins, 2014).
