The resulting product is expected to exhibit a +135.983 Da (calculated) mass shift and preferred formation of the y series of product ions during MS/MS fragmentation.13 Figure 3 shows the MS spectra of the peptide solution after 30 min alkylation at room temperature (Fig. 3(a)), after storage of the reaction mixture overnight at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 3(b)) and treatment with the CAF reagent (Fig. 3(c)). Overnight storage of the reaction solution resulted in \u223c53% transformation of the 1024.453 Da peptide into a 1007.428 Da product (Fig. 3(b)). This transformation was confirmed by HPLC fractionation of the reaction mixture from Fig. 3(b), after which two prominent peaks were observed in the chromatogram, separated by 2.2 min, corresponding to the unmodified 1024.453 Da peptide and its \u221217 Da product (Fig. 4). Identity of the peptides was confirmed by MALDI\u2010MS. Based on the ratio of peak areas in Fig. 4, the calculated degree of conversion is 42% compared with 53% in Fig. 3(b).",
