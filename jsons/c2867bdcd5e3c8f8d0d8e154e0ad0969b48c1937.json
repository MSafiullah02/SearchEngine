Earlier detected in Wuhan, Hubei province, in China in December 2019, the deadly virus engulfed China and some neighboring countries, which claimed thousands of lives in February 2020. The proposed hybrid methodology involves the application of discreet wavelet decomposition to the dataset of deaths due to COVID-19, which splits the input data into component series and then applying an appropriate econometric model to each of the component series for making predictions of death cases in future. ARIMA models are well known econometric forecasting models capable of generating accurate forecasts when applied on wavelet decomposed time series.",

Researchers are taking the help of mathematical modeling in order to provide answers to such urgent queries (Chen et al., 2020) . For instance, to contain the spread, strategies such as social distancing, quarantine and contact tracing of the infected or suspected people, the complete lockdown of the area or countries dealing with it and screening international travelers are the results of model predictions (Hellewell et al. 2020; Prem et al. 2020; Mandal et al. 2019; Choi and Ki, 2020; Yuan et al. 2020) . Early modeling results by Kucharski et al. based on the stochastic transmission model told about the variation of COVID-19 over a certain period of time, probability of an outbreak in other areas outside Wuhan and observed a decline in reproduction number from 2.35 to 1.05 after the introduction of travel restrictions . In another study by Chen et al. (2020) , a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model was developed to simulate the probable transmission from bats to human beings. They also simplified the above model and found that majorly the transmission occurred from person to person relying on the reproduction number estimated as 3.58 (Prem et al. 2020) . Li et al. also provided evidence about the person to person transmission route in Wuhan, China, and the calculated that the number of infections doubled in 7.4 days . Similarly, several other models have been used to access the outbreak characteristics Binti Hamzah et al. 2020; Lin et al. 2020) .",

Box-Jenkins based ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model is a widely used statistical model in time series analysis, which covers a wide variety of patterns, ranging from stationary to non-stationary and seasonal (periodic) time series (Melard and Pasteels, 2000; Valenzuela et al., 2008) . However, in dealing with non-linear situations where data is not a linear function of time, Box-Jenkins methodology is inappropriate (Box & Jenkins, 1976; Kantz & Schreider, 1997; Melard & Pasteels, 2000; babu et al. 2014) . For accurate forecasting of non-linear data, wavelet analysis is a magnificent tool that is capable of diagnosing high-frequency components in time series data (Mallat 1989; Daubechies 1992; Meyer and Coifman 1997; Percival and Walden 2000; Freire et al. 2019) . Discreet wavelet transformation involves decomposition of time series at different scales, and each component series can be treated for forecasting purpose (Torrence and Compo 1998; Ramsey 2002; Parmar et al. 2014 Parmar et al. , 2015 Soni et al. 2014 Soni et al. , 2015 Soni et al. , 2016 Kumar et al. 2015) . The use of wavelets for forecasting purposes includes the extent of refinement and flexibility, which the traditional methods cannot afford (Diebold 1998; Yousefi et al. 2005; Huang et al. 2011; Yeap et al. 2017; Jeddi 2020) .",

There are several families of wavelets for wavelet decomposition, but Daubechies wavelet is one of the important types of wavelets which has its own advantages. An accurate forecasting system is developed on the basis of appropriate order and level of decomposition of the input signal. COVID-19 death cases data is decomposed by using the Daubechies wavelet of order 8 and level 3, which are shown in figure 2. The approximation parts are low-frequency parts showing a trend and detailed parts representing high-frequency parts. The approximation A3 and details D1, D2, D3 are separately modeled with an appropriate ARIMA model to obtain predicted components.

ARIMA model is based on the Box-Jenkins Model (1960), which makes use of past values to predict future values of time series. ARIMA modeling approach basically has three phases; model identification, parameter estimation, and diagnostic checking of the model. The model identification stage determines the time series for stationarity and seasonality, which needs to be modeled before parameter estimation. The stationarity of time series can be judged from an autocorrelation function (ACF) plot, and in case of non-stationary time series, differencing transformation can be applied to obtain stationary data. Seasonality can be modeled by taking seasonal differencing and regenerating autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF)",

The performance of hybrid model is nearly better than ARIMA model for the countries Italy, Spain and UK whereas it is approximately better for the countries France and USA.
