            "text": "Sialic acids are a diverse family of monosaccharides widely expressed on all cell surfaces of vertebrates and higher invertebrates (such as starfish and sea urchin), and on some bacteria that interact with vertebrates [1]. The expression of sialic acids is highly conserved in deuterostomes, i.e., from echinoderms to humans [2]. Sialic acids are biosynthesized by almost all organisms as a 9-carbon carboxylated monosaccharide and found most frequently as the terminal sugars of cell surface glycolipids and glycoproteins [3], [4], [5], [6]. Because of their terminal location and negative charge, sialic acids have numerous roles in many aspect of immunity [1]. These monosaccharides have the potential to contribute or inhibit many intermolecular and intercellular interactions [4], [7]. Sialic acids also contribute to many features of the cell surface and frequently serve as ligands for receptor-mediated intercellular interactions, host cell-pathogen recognition processes and lymphocyte-endothelial cell interactions [8], [9]. Many earlier studies removed sialic acids from immune cell surfaces using sialidases and observed changes in behavior of such cells [1]. Sialic acids are crucial in the development of vertebrates, as observed that mouse embryos engineered to deficiency of sialic acid expression die after they birth [10]. In pathogenic diseases, including some inflammations, particular microbes recognize cell surface sialic acids when invading host cells [11], [12]. For example, binding of influenza A and B viruses to host cell is accomplished by the specific recognition of the host sialic acid linkage by the virus. Sialylated molecules on Aspergillus fumigatus conidia (fungal pathogen) are recognized by cultured mouse macrophages and lung epithelial cell lines and enhance the uptake of conidia into the endosomal system of the host cell [13]. Sialic acid residues can also mask recognition sites such as galactose residues on glycoproteins to prevent their in vivo removal by asiaologlycoprotein receptors [14]. In certain cancers, changes in sialic acid amounts, types and linkages have been associated with tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis [12]. More than 50 naturally occurring sialic acid [15], [16], [17] derivatives of the three main forms, N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and 2-keto-3-deoxy-nonulosonic acid (KDN) were identified [6], [18]. The great structural diversity in the sialic acids originates from different substitutions on the amino group at carbon 5 and hydroxyl groups at carbons 4, 7, 8 and 9 by acetyl groups (O-acetylation) [3], [19], [20].",

In terms of their immune systems, echinoderms represent the same basic types of responses that most multicellular (including vertebrates) animals do. The coelomocytes of echinoderms can recognize self from non-self and, if a foreign material (e.g., microorganism/pathogen) enters the body cavity, they can readily neutralize it and dispose of it [32], [34], [35]. Due to multifarious roles of sialic acids in immunity [1], sialic acid is an ideal points of investigation in coelomocytes of echinoids. Until recently, there has been no study on the determination and function of sialic acid and their types in immune system cells, particularly in the echinoderm coelomocytes.",

Sialic acids derivatized with DMB (Fig. 1\n) in all samples were presented with dehydrated ion ([M + H-18]+ and pseudomolecular ion [M + H]+ by MS in the positive ion mode. The molecular mass of sialic acid derivatives, and thereby the number and type of the substituent is reflected by pseudomolecular ion [M + H]+. An important CID (collision-induced dissociation) fragment is the result of H2O elimination, [M + H-18]+. Other product ions obtained from CID using MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) analysis also provides useful information regarding the identity and location substituents of sialic acids, even without knowing the relative retention times of standard sialic acid derivatives [4]. But, this approach is limited in ion trap systems due to an inherently low mass cutoff (LMCO) derived from CID. The ion trap fails to trap the ions at lower end of the m/z range when using CID for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) [41]. Therefore, [M + H-18]+ ions obtained from MRM of sialic acids are very useful for screening the chromatogram and the spectrum in MS/MS system [15].",

Also, Neu5Gc type of sialic acids and its acetylated compounds (Neu5Gc7Ac, Neu5Gc8Ac and Neu5Gc9Ac) were identified at m/z = 484 [M + H]+, m/z = 466 [M + H-18]+. The distributions of sialic acids in total coelomocyte population were shown Fig. 4\n. KDN is a structurally related \u03b1-keto acid that is also found in glycoconjugates [13]. However, under the conditions used in this study, KDN was not found both coelomocytes and BSM. Hence, Neu5Gc was established as the predominant sialic acid on circulating coelomocytes of P. lividus.\n",

            "text": "Although small amounts of sialic acid have been reported in insects [21], [22], [23] and a gastropod [24], they are not found generally in glycoconjugates of protostome animals [42]. However, within the deuterostomate lineage of the animal kingdom, both the echinoderms and vertebrates possess significant amounts of sialylated glycoconjugates and frequently display a considerable number of sialic acid types. The structural variety among the sialic acids results from a number of enzyme-catalyzed modifications of N-acetylneuraminic acid occurring at different stages of glycoconjugate biosynthesis [43]. N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is one of the most common sialic acids and formally results from the hydroxylation of the methyl group of the 5-N-acetyl moiety of Neu5Ac. Interestingly, no Neu5Gc has been found in human and chicken tissues, although small amounts have been detected in tumors [9]. In the marine deuterostomes, including sea urchins and starfish, Neu5Gc is often main and predominant sialic acid and is widely distributed in glycoproteins and gangliosides of especially oocyte and sperm cells, suggesting that it is involved in a number of important biological functions in these marine invertebrates [9], [25], [44], [45]. In immune cells of sea urchin, P. lividus, Neu5Gc was the most abundant type sialic acid when compared with other found sialic acid types. Cell surface glycoconjugates which include Neu5Gc may help to protect tissues from attack by certain pathogen-derived toxic enzymes. In order to aid the digestion of the cell surface glycoconjugates, several microorganisms secrete sialidase, which may facilitate bacterial infection. Since the cleavage rate of Neu5Gc by bacterial and viral sialidases is generally lower than that of Neu5Ac, the expression of Neu5Gc may be an adaptation to retard the effects of sialidases [46]. Neu5Ac is the most common ligand for virus binding but Neu5Gc and O-acetylated sialic acids were also found to be specific ligands, for example for influenza C and corona viruses [16]. The presence of Neu5Gc and its derivatives with O-acetyl groups in immune system cells of sea urchin may be related to their habitat, providing a first line of defense against sialidase-containing microorganisms. According to the results, our data may provide an explanation of why 9-O-acetylated Neu5Gc (Neu5Gc9Ac) was found more than other O-acetylated sialic acids in immune cells of P. lividus (Fig. 4).",

            "text": "Naturally occurring sialic acids can be O-acetylated at all their hydroxyl groups at positions C4, C7, C8 and C9 of these carboxylated sugars [47]. One sialic acid molecule may carry one or several, up to there, O-acetyl groups but they mostly are mono-O-acetylated derivatives. Biological effect depends on the position relative to the 9-carbon scaffold and whether it is the Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc [2], [47]. O-acetylated sialic acids seem to be involved in many biological phenomena [2]. Given variable expression of O-acetyl groups on sialic acids and their diverse effects in all immune reactions [1]. O-acetylation of sialic acids can be developmentally regulated in immune systems or create new biological functions [3], [6]. They therefore revealed to be important in cell differentiation, neural development, non-immunogenic protection and immuno reactivity [47]. However, high levels of 9-O-acetylated sialic acids were detected on developing and peripheral resting and activated T-cells [48]. As another example, side chain O-acetylated sialic acids are also expressed human leukocytes, where they can be used as markers for specific subsets of T-helper cell. For several subsets of T-lymphocytes O-acetylation of sialic acids is known to be a differentiation and maturation marker [47], [48]. This may be one of reasons why immune cells, circulating coelomocytes, contain such a wide variety of O-acetylated sialic acids (Neu5Gc9Ac, Neu5Gc8Ac, Neu5,9Ac2, Neu5,7Ac2, Neu5,8Ac2, Neu5,7,9Ac3, Neu5Gc7,9Ac2, Neu5Gc7Ac). And also, O-acetylation of sialic acids may be a novel marker for finding subsets of coelomocytes like T-cells.",
