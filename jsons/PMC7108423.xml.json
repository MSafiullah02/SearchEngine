            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel worldwide infectious disease, which is caused by a newly identified member of the coronaviridae family, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Ksiazek et al., 2003, Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). In coronavirus, the highly basic nucleocapsid protein (N) binds to RNA to form a helical nucleocapsid, followed by the combination with three other virion proteins, Membrane protein (M), Spike protein (S), and Envelope protein (E). Both the M and E proteins are essential for coronavirus morphogenesis (de Haan, Kuo, Masters, Vennema, & Rottier, 1998; Vennema et al., 1996), and interactions between these two proteins seem to drive the coronavirus envelope assembly, thus producing virus-like particles in the absence of other viral components (Escors, Ortego, & Enjuanes, 2001b). The M protein is able to bind to the nucleocapsid protein in the absence of S and E protein (Narayanan, Maeda, Maeda, & Makino, 2000), and the M protein binds to nucleocapsid with its carboxyl terminus in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Kuo & Masters, 2002; Narayanan et al., 2000) and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) (Escors et al., 2001b, Escors et al., 2001c). Moreover, two homologous segments, residues 201\u2013224 of MHV M protein and residues 233\u2013257 of TGEV M protein, were mapped to be involved in the M/N protein\u2013protein interaction (Escors et al., 2001c, Kuo and Masters, 2002). Recently, SARS-CoV M/N interaction in the absence of viral RNA was validated in vivo through the mammalian two-hybrid system, which reinforced the fact that the M/N interaction makes the formation of the crucial structure for coronavirus (He et al., 2004). However, the knowledge about this interaction is still limited and more explorations are needed.",

It is believed that the C-terminal polar tail within the endodomain interacts with N and S proteins (de Haan, Smeets, Vernooij, Vennema, & Rottier, 1999; Opstelten, Raamsman, Wolfs, Horzinek, & Rottier, 1995), which suggests that the large M endodomain (ME) probably makes great sense in SARS-CoV assembly.",

It is found that the residues 197\u2013221 of M protein and the residues 341\u2013422 of N protein are contributed to this interaction. These two highly polar fragments imply that SARS-CoV ME/N interaction might be of ionic nature. SPR based results indicated that SARS-CoV ME interacts with N protein with a high affinity, and the electrostatic attractive force plays an important role in their interaction. In addition, it is noted that two highly conserved amino acids (L218 and L219) of SARS-CoV M protein are not involved in the M/N interaction. This current report is hoped to contribute some useful information to shedding light on the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV M/N interaction.",

PCR was used to confirm transformation with the target gene. A positive clone was inoculated in the SD medium lacking leucine, typtophan and histidine (SD-LTH) and supplemented with 1 mM 3-amino-1\u2032,2\u2032,4\u2032-triazole (SD-LTH + 3-AT).

The absorbance at 595 nm of the medium in the 96-well microplate was measured in a TECAN reader (Switzerland). The growing and measuring courses were repeated three times for each experiment and the absorbance was obtained by average. All the yeast media were prepared according to the standard Protocols Handbook (PT3024-1, Clontech).

Expression of the protein was induced at an OD600 of 0.5\u20130.7 with addition of isopropyl-\u03b2-d-galactoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.2 mM. After induction for 4 h at 18 \u00b0C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation for 30 min at 4000 rpm, 4 \u00b0C and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C overnight. The frozen cells were thawed, re-suspended in 18 mL of buffer A (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF), and then lysed by sonication for 15 min in ice bath. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and the supernatant was loaded on a Sepharose Ni-NTA column (Amersham Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was eluted with elution buffer (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole) after being washed by wash buffer (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 100 mM imidazole). The elution fraction was further applied to a gel filtration column (Hiprep\u2122 16/60 sephacyl S100) on an FPLC system. The column was pre-equilibrated with HBS buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) before loading the protein sample. ME protein was thus eluted by HBS buffer, and concentrated by Ultrafree4 tube (Milipore Co.) The protein purity was determined by SDS-PAGE and concentration was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm in HBS buffer using the extinction coefficient of 13075 L mol\u22121\n cm\u22121.",

The flow cell immobilized with lysozyme (2200 RU) was used as the negative reference, and all responses on the experimental flow cell were subtracted to the responses on the control flow cell. The interaction between SARS-CoV ME and the immobilized SARS-CoV N protein were shown as in Fig. 4\nA (gray curves).

The kinetic parameters for SARS-CoV ME/N interaction (k\non and k\noff) were successfully determined by evaluating the curves according to the 1:1 Langmuir binding model. The evaluated curves were found to superpose the experimental curves very well (Fig. 4A) and the reliability of the fitting model could be also reflected by the small residuals (Fig. 4B).

Furthermore, this M/N protein\u2013protein-binding stoichiometry (1:1) for SARS coronavirus seems to be comparable with that for TGEV coronavirus, whose 1:1 binding ratio was accurately estimated (Escors, Camafeita, Ortego, Laude, & Enjuanes, 2001a).",

SARS-CoV ME/N11 (N4) interactions were studied with the purified N11 and N4 immobilized on the CM5 sensor chip surface. As shown in Fig. 5\nA, 30 \u03bcM of SARS-CoV ME showed only 13 RU in response when binding to N4, and 5 \u03bcM of SARS-CoV ME demonstrated up to 700 RU when binding to the full-length N (Fig. 4A), this indicated that N4 almost lost the ME-binding capability. By contrast, as shown in Fig. 5B, the immobilized N11 interact with SARS-CoV ME with a high affinity (K\nD\n = 0.61 \u00b1 0.06 \u03bcM) close to that of SARS-CoV ME/N interaction (K\nD\n = 0.55 \u00b1 0.04 \u03bcM). These results thus further proved that the carboxyl terminus of SARS-CoV N protein, residues 341\u2013422 in particular, are critical for SARS-CoV M/N interaction. Moreover, our result also indicated that the reported residues 168\u2013208 (He et al., 2004) might not contribute greatly to SARS-CoV M/N interaction, in accordance with the above-mentioned yeast two-hybrid results. In fact, for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and TGEV, their M proteins have been believed to bind to the carboxyl terminuses of the N proteins (Kuo and Masters, 2002). Although SARS-CoV N shares only little homology with other coronavirus N protein, there might be a general pattern common to all the coronavirus N proteins: the protein is highly basic overall, and there is a concentration of acidic residues in its carboxyl terminal domain (Laude and Masters, 1995). Thus it is possible that the carboxyl terminus of N protein binding to M protein might be the common feature for coronavirus.",

Then the interaction between ME1 and the immobilized SARS-CoV N was studied on Biacore 3000. The results showed that SARS-CoV ME1/N interaction is very weak (Fig. 6\nA). Together with the above-mentioned fact that SARS-CoV ME bind stongly to SARS-CoV N protein (Fig. 4A), it suggested that residues 197\u2013221 of SARS-CoV M protein were involved in SARS-CoV M/N interaction. To further confirm the contribution of these 25 residues to this interaction, the MCT peptide (RYRIGNYKLNTDHAGSNDNIALLVQ, residues 197\u2013221 of SARS-CoV M) interaction with the immobilized SARS-CoV N protein was also quantitatively investigated on Biacore 3000. Fig. 6B clearly showed that the MCT peptide could bind to the immobilized SARS-CoV N protein, and the related kinetic parameters could be determined by 1:1 Langmuir binding model as k\non\n = 509 \u00b1 42 M\u22121\n s\u22121, k\noff\n = 0.0394 \u00b1 0.002 s\u22121 and K\nD\n = 75 \u00b1 5 \u03bcM. Moreover, the inhibition of the MCT peptide against SARS-CoV ME/N interaction was also studied. In the surface competition assays, 5 \u03bcM SARS-CoV ME protein was mixed with different concentrations of the MCT peptide before injection. As shown in Fig. 6C, the responses for the mixtures decreased with the increase of the MCT peptide, which thereby suggested that the MCT peptide could inhibit SARS-CoV ME protein binding to the immobilized N protein. In addition, as shown in Fig. 6D, the fact that the control peptide (AGGAGAGGEA) did not interact with the immobilized SARS-CoV N and rendered no effects on SARS-CoV ME/N interaction suggested the specificity of SARS-CoV N/MCT peptide interaction.",

Quantitatively kinetic studies revealed that the equilibrium dissociation constants (K\nD) for SARS-CoV ME/N interaction at pH 5.4 (21.2 \u03bcM) and pH 9.6 (0.85 \u03bcM) were greater than that at pH 7.4 (0.55 \u03bcM), which thus suggests that SARS-CoV M/N interaction might be of ionic nature.",

Kinetic analysis further indicated that the binding affinity for SARS-CoV ME/N decreased by two orders of magnitude, with the K\nD value from 0.55 \u03bcM increased to 49.2 \u03bcM. This indicated that SARS-CoV M/N interaction was relative to ionic strength, and electrostatic force might play an important role in SARS-CoV M/N interaction. To further explore the electrostatic attractive or repulsive force involved in this interaction, we replaced 400 mM NaCl (monovalent cation) by 50 mM CaCl2 (divalent cation) for maintaining the similar ionic strength to repeat the SPR experiment. Interestingly, in the presence of 50 mM Ca2+, SARS-CoV ME almost showed a similar binding response (260 RU) to that in 400 mM NaCl as shown in Fig. 7B.

By multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 8\nA), we found that in the C-terminus of SARS-CoV M, there was no \u2018LLR(K)\u2019 or \u2018R(K)LL\u2019 motif but a conserved \u201cLL\u201d. We thereby suspected that L218 and L219 of M protein might also contribute to SARS-CoV M/N interaction. To validate this, we studied the interaction between the double-site mutated SARS-CoV ME (L218L219\u2013A218A219) and the immobilized SARS-CoV N protein on Biacore 3000. As shown in Fig. 8B, the fitted K\nD value of 0.58 \u03bcM for the mutated SARS-CoV ME binding to the immobilized SARS-CoV N protein is very similar to that for the wild type SARS-CoV ME binding to SARS-CoV N (K\nD\n = 0.55 \u03bcM) (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, as indicated by the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 8C), the double-site mutated SARS-CoV ME showed the similar N protein binding ability to the wild type SARS-CoV ME protein. Therefore, these results indicated that L218 and L219 might be not important in SARS-CoV M/N interaction.",

SPR kinetic assays revealed that the endodomain (aa102\u2013221) of SARS-CoV M interacts with SARS-CoV N protein with high affinity. This binding affinity, however, could be weakened greatly by acidification, high concentration salt (400 mM NaCl) and divalent cation (50 mM Ca2+), thus suggesting that the electrostatic attraction might play an important role in SARS-CoV M/N interaction. These results clearly showed that SARS-CoV M protein interacts with N protein mostly through their carboxyl termini by electrostatic attraction. According to our results, the residues 168\u2013208 of SARS-CoV N might be involved in but not contribute greatly to SARS-CoV M/N interaction, which seems to be not compatible with the reported result that these residues might be critical for SARS-CoV M/N interaction (He et al., 2004). While we are preparing this manuscript, Fang et al. published the result that residues 194\u2013205 of SARS-CoV M were involved in SARS-CoV M/N interaction by GST pull-down method (Fang et al., 2005), this region is within our proved residues 197\u2013221 in SARS-CoV M responsible for binding to SARS-CoV N protein. As discussed above, the electrostatic attraction might play an important role in SARS-CoV M/N interaction, it is thereby suggested that the three basic amino acids, R197, R199 and K204 in the overlapping sequence (aa197\u2013205, RYRIGNYKL) of SARS-CoV M might be responsible for its binding to SARS-CoV N protein. In addition, it is noted that the two highly conserved amino acids (L218 and L219) of SARS-CoV M protein are not involved in SARS-CoV M/N interaction. Our current work will hopefully help understanding the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV M/N interaction and provide valuable clues for mutagenic studies to disrupt virion assembly.",
