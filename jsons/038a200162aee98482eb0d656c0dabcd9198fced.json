One can therefore ask what altered immunologic mechanisms may render an allergic individual more susceptible to severe nasal and bronchial immune pathology upon viral encounter than nonallergic individuals. Viral involvement in upper and lower airway pathology during common cold has been extensively tested and confirmed in adult volunteers. A wide variety of respiratory viruses can induce common cold symptoms (7) . Several studies have used experimentally induced human infection models to study the immune pathology of common cold (1, 2) .
