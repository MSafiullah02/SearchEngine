            "text": "The first steps in tissue culture are dating back to the beginning of the nineteenth century when biosafety measures did not yet exist. Later on, animal cell culture became essential for scientific research, diagnosis and biotechnological activities. Along with this development, biosafety concerns have emerged pointing to the risks for human health and in a lesser extent for the environment associated to the handling of animal cell cultures. The management of these risks requires a thorough risk assessment of both the cell cultures and the type of manipulation prior the start of any activity. It involves a case-by-case evaluation of both the intrinsic properties of the cell culture genetically modified or not and the probability that it may inadvertently or intentionally become infected with pathogenic microorganisms. The latter hazard is predominant when adventitious contaminants are pathogenic or have a better capacity to persist in unfavourable conditions. Consequently, most of the containment measures primarily aim at protecting cells from adventitious contamination. Cell cultures known to harbour an infectious etiologic agent should be manipulated in compliance with containment measures recommended for the etiologic agent itself. The manipulation of cell cultures from human or primate origin necessitates the use of a type II biosafety cabinet. The scope of this chapter is to highlight aspects relevant for the risk assessment and to summarize the main biosafety recommendations and the recent technological advances allowing a mitigation of the risk for the handling of animal cell cultures.",

To this end, a case-by-case risk assessment is conducted which consists in the identification and characterisation of potential effects, which may be intended or unintended, together with an assessment of the likelihood and consequences should any effect occur. Depending on the risks identified, risk management measures can be proposed. The use of cell cultures may fall within the scope of one or several regulatory provisions which consider an assessment of biological risks. For example in Europe, tissue culture work will in many cases involve the use of genetically modified cell lines as well, in which case a risk assessment should be made in accordance with the provisions of the Directive 2009/41/EC related to the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms (European Commission 2009). Cell culturing activities aiming at manufacturing biopharmaceuticals are covered by the Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and its amending acts laying down procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use (European Commission 2004a), whereas activities that involve the use of human cells and tissues for application to the human body falls within the scope of the Directive 2004/23/EC and its amending acts (European Commission 2004b) . The manipulation of animal cell cultures also exposes the worker to potential biological risks which are considered under the provision of the European Directive 2000/54/ EC (European Commission 2000) . It should be pointed out that guidelines aiming at mitigating the biological risks for the laboratory workers, public health and the environment have been issued by some scientific advisory bodies or competent authorities (World Health Organization 2004; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2009a; Swiss Expert Committee for Biosafety 2011).",

In the 1970s, some initiatives for implementing measures guaranteeing the safe use of recombinant DNA were linked to the safety measures which were at that time already successfully applied in microbiology for the containment of pathogenic organisms (National Institute of Health 1979). The conjunction of these two aspects constitutes two pillars of biosafety and has led to a classification system of organisms into risk classes or risk groups. So far, many risk assessments have been carried out among the scientific community on the use of pathogenic organisms (genetically modified or not), regardless of the scale or the purpose of the activity. The basis for this risk assessment methodology takes into account the most recent scientific, technical data and uses a scientifically sound approach.",

            "text": "The risk assessment methodology is commonly used and its 4-step approach is described in Fig. 22 .1. The first step (1) takes into account the characteristics of the organism(s) used and, in the case of genetic modification, the genetic material introduced and the resulting GMO. Based on information relative to their harmful characteristics, natural pathogenic micro-organisms can be categorised in several classes of risk or risk groups. This classification takes into account the severity of the disease that pathogenic organisms may cause to human or animal health, their ability to spread amongst the population and the availability of prophylaxis or efficient treatment (World Health Organization 2004) . For zoopathogens, the classification system is mainly based on the definitions of the World Organisation of Animal Health (OIE), which categorises animal pathogens into four groups according to their risk to animal health, and since 2008, their risk to human health as well (World Organisation for Animal Health 2009). Micro-organisms that are unlikely to cause disease are classified into class of risk 1 while etiologic agents responsible for severe diseases with a high potential of transmissibility and for which no prophylaxis or treatment is available are assigned to class of risk 4. As such, pathogenic organisms will be categorised from class of risk 2 to class of risk 4. Some periodically revised reference lists issued by international and national authorities or advisory committees classify natural biological agents (not genetically modified) into risk groups or assign the biosafety level under which these should be manipulated ( In the second step (2), the magnitude of the identified negative effects such as human diseases, including allergenic or toxic effects or the transfer of genetic material to other organisms are characterized. In a third step (3), an assessment is performed of the exposure of the laboratory worker, the population and/or the environment to the considered organism and the consequences of each negative effect should it occur. In the fourth step (4), a characterization of the risk is performed resulting in the assignment of the risk level associated with the contained use involving the use of the organism(s). On this basis, the containment measures and other protection measures (e.g. safe work practices, safety equipment and biological waste management) to be adopted are determined. There are four levels Fig. 22 .1 Flow diagram summarizing the Biorisk assessment and management methodology of risk to which contained uses can be assigned, with level of risk increasing from 1 to 4. The final step consists in definitively classifying the contained use activity by conducting a re-assessment of the whole procedure before starting the research, diagnosis or production activity.",

With respect to the biological risks and the risk assessment associated with the manipulation of animal cell cultures, three properties intrinsic to cell cultures should be considered : the species of origin, the cell type or type of tissue, organ from which the cell line is derived and the status of the culture ( Fig. 22 .2). With respect to the species of origin and based on the fact that pathogens usually have specific species barriers, it is considered that the closer the genetic relationship of the cell culture is to humans, the higher the risk is to humans. The incidence to harbour organisms that could cause harm to human health is therefore considered higher in human or primate cells compared to cells of non-human origin (Brown 1997) . Accordingly, mammalian cells other than human or primate cells are considered to represent less risk, followed by avian and invertebrate cells. However, it should be kept in mind that some infectious agents are able to cross the species barrier and to persist in new host species, leading to zoonotic diseases. It is acknowledged since many years that more or less 70 % of the emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic (Chomel et al. 2007) . Well documented cases of viruses that have crossed the species barrier from animal reservoirs to humans include hantavirus (murine reservoir), haemorrhagic fever viruses (Ebola, Marburg) (Peters et al. 1992 ), avian Influenza virus (Reperant et al. 2012) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus (Ksiazek et al. 2003; Herman et al. 2004) . These examples show that incidences of cross-species transfer can occur and that occupational risks related to exposure to infected animal tissues or cell cultures should not be underestimated (Mahy and Brown 2000; Louz et al. 2005) .",

For example, intestinal and certain leukocytes have a half-life of a few days, human erythrocytes have approximately a 55-60-day half-life, healthy liver cells have a life span of several months, whereas, in adults, there is a slow loss of brain cells with little replacement. Partly due to this fact, some cell lines can be more readily obtained than others. The establishment of cell lines is often obtained by a series of (generally uncontrolled) mutations that occur by culturing cells for a longer period. It is known that cells cultured for extensive periods of time display changing growth properties. A reduction of the doubling time, as a result of transformation, may give cells the ability to overgrow the rest of the population and to survive for a large (infinite) number of passages compared to primary cells with a finite life span. Therefore, the establishment of cell cultures of a certain cell type upon extensive passage relies on the positive selection for cells that have a growth advantage. These transformed cells can have an increased tumorigenic potential and may present more risks of becoming/being fully neoplastic upon accidental (Gugel and Sanders 1986) or deliberate introduction into the human body. Therefore, taking the tumorigenic potential into account, the following cell types may be ranked in increasing order of risk: epithelial and fibroblast cells, gut mucosa, endothelium, neural tissues, haematogenous (e.g. blood, lymphoid) cells and tissue.",

However, as they are characterised by a finite life span, the time available for characterisation and detection of contaminating agents remains limited. Also, because typical cell characteristics are often lost during the passage of cells, primary cell cultures are repeatedly obtained from fresh tissue, resulting in increasing risks for potential contaminating pathogens.",

            "text": "Many micro-organisms benefit from a cell's machinery to complete their life cycles and to disseminate. Hence the study of a pathogens' lifecycle or immunity escape mechanism requires the intentional in vitro infection of animal (or human) cells. The identification of potential hazards associated with infected cell cultures requires a consideration of the intrinsic cell properties and the inherent properties of the infecting pathogen. The latter implies an assessment of a number of pathogen specific criteria along with aspects such as the existence of effective treatment or prophylaxis. On the basis of these criteria the WHO defines a classification system that enables the categorisation of micro-organisms into four risk groups (World Health Organization 2004) . A fundamental rule is that the biological risk of infected cell cultures will depend on the infecting pathogen(s) class of risk. For example, cell cultures deliberately infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in order to produce virus particles are assigned to class of risk 3, as HCV is a class of risk 3 virus. Human cells infected with an airborne pathogen like species of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex are also assigned to class of risk 3 and are requiring the adoption of Biosafety Level 3 containment. However, as discussed below, the class of risk to which the infected cell cultures are assigned will not necessarily indicate the level of containment to be implemented as the latter will also be determined by the nature of the work carried out with these cells. An example is the infection of bovine leukocytes with Theileria parva, a tick-transmitted, intracellular protozoan of veterinary importance and the causative agent of East Coast fever among domestic livestock. It is an animal pathogen of risk group 3, which is not pathogenic to humans. The sporozoite form (infective form) invades bovine lymphocytes where it develops into a non-infective form (shizonts) and induces host cell transformation and clonal expansion of the cell. These infected bovine leucocytes may be categorised under class of risk 2 for animals, while the biosafety level (BSL1 or 2) appropriate for handling is determined by the presence or absence of the infectious form of the parasites.",

In case of outbreaks the harvested tissues from dead or living infected patients are inoculated to a permissive cell line (generally on VERO E6 cells) and eventually subjected to electron microscopy for morphological analysis of the causal virus. Although alternatives methods such as high throughput DNA sequencing are available to identify a microorganism without a prior in vitro expansion, cell culture followed by electron microscopy remains the complementary approach of choice to molecular methods for the unbiased diagnosis of ill-defined infectious disease. Some of the diagnostic activities presented by the authors required the adoption of BSL3 measures to handle the cell cultures. It illustrates how activities involving the in vitro amplification of unknown virus may represent a risk for the laboratory personnel and requires the adoption of an appropriate containment level and work practices.",

Typically, these organisms cause increased turbidity, pH shift of media (change in media colour), slower growth of the cells and cell destruction. Antibiotics may be used to prevent cell bacterial contamination, however, continuous use of antibiotics in cultures may lead to development of resistant organisms with slow growing properties, which are much more difficult to detect by direct visual observation. Compared to bacterial or fungal infections, mycoplasma contamination gives more problems in terms of incidence, detectability, prevention and eradication. Mycoplasma, an intracellular bacterium, is one of the most common cell culture contaminants. It may go unnoticed for many passages and can change several cell properties such as growth, metabolism, morphology and genome structure (Paddenberg et al. 1996; McGarrity and Kotani 1985) . It has also been reported to influence the yield of virus production in infected cells (Hargreaves and Leach 1970) . Mycoplasmal contamination is also a biosafety concern, because some of the contaminating Mycoplasma spp. belong to risk group 2. Together with M. arginini, M. orale, M. pirum and M. fermentans, pathogenic organisms like M. gallisepticum (risk group 3 for animals), M. hyorhinis (risk group 2 for animals), M. pneumoniae and M. hominis (risk group 2 for humans) account for more than 96 % of mycoplasma contaminants in cell cultures. Primary sources of contamination with M. orale, M. fermentans, and M. hominis in the laboratory are infected people who handle cell cultures and suspensions of viruses. Sources of M. argini and M. hyorhinis are usually animal donors of tissues and biological constituents used for cell culture, e.g. calf serum and trypsin (Razin and Tully 1995; Pinheiro de Oliveira et al. 2013) . It was already reported that the contamination of cell cultures by Mycoplasma occurs via aerosols (O'Connell et al. 1964 ).",

            "text": "Viral contamination merits particular attention because infected cells may pose a serious harm to human health, especially when infected cells are able to release infectious particles. Human cells may be infected by various viruses like hepatitis viruses, retroviruses, herpes viruses or papillomaviruses. Although cell cultures from non-human origin may pose less risk, it should be emphasised that many viruses have a broad host range and can cross species barriers. Since a number of non-human viruses are capable of infecting and/or replicating in human cells in vitro, their possibility to infect human cells in vivo if human exposure occurs should be carefully considered. Well-known viral contaminants of primate tissues or cells from non-human origin that can cause human disease are listed in Table 22 .1. While contamination with some viruses may be associated with changes in cell morphology or behaviour -such as the formation of syncytia (HIV, herpes viruses), swelling of cells (adenoviruses) or haemagglutination or haemadsorption -viral contamination may be harder to detect when cytopathic effects remain absent. Viral contamination could also trigger adverse effects as a result of recombination events or phenotypic mixing between contaminating components and experimentally introduced agents, creating agents with new properties. For example, experimental results suggested that HTLV-I or HTLV-II undergo phenotypic mixing with HIV-1 in HTLV/HIV-1 co-infected cells, leading to an increase of the pathogenicity of HIV-1 by broadening the spectrum of its cellular tropism to CD4 negative cells (Lusso et al. 1990 ). Another example is the contamination of murine cell cultures by Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). LCMV is an arenavirus that establishes a silent, chronic infection in mice but causes aseptic meningitis, encephalitis or meningoencephalitis to humans. The significance of LCMV contamination has been reinforced by the description of cases of laboratory-acquired LCMV infections arising from contaminated murine tumour cell lines (Mahy et al. 1991) . Manipulation of LCMV infected material or material with an increased likelihood of LCMV contamination necessitates the Whitley (2001) Papovaviruses 2 Butel ( Adventitious contamination with parasites may be an issue when handling primary cell or organ cultures originating from a donor organism that is known or suspected to be infected with a specific parasite. As the life cycle of most parasites comprises distinct developmental stages, transmission and survival of the parasite will strongly depend on the ability of the invasive stage to recognize and invade specific host cells. But even with cells developing the non-infectious form of parasites, possible harmful effects remain to be considered since natural modes of transmission could be bypassed during the manipulation of infected cells. It is recognised that most of the parasitic laboratory acquired infections are caused by needle stick injuries (Herwaldt 2001) .",

Contrary to the majority of the infectious agents, TSE agents are resistant to most of the physical and chemical methods commonly used for decontamination of infectious agents. It has been shown that neuroblastoma cell lines, primary cultured neurons and astrocytes can serve as hosts (Butler et al. 1988) . Although many studies have suggested that the risk of propagation of TSE agents in tissue culture cells cultivated in the presence of bovine serum potentially contaminated with TSE was restricted to neurons or brain-derived cell cultures, it has been shown recently that non-neuronal cells can also support TSE infection, suggesting that any cell line expressing normal host prion protein could have the potential to support propagation of TSE agents (Vilette et al. 2001; Vorberg et al. 2004) . While the understanding of the transmission of prions is still in progress (natural transmission seems mainly to take place via oral route in human and animals), investigators using cell cultures need to take into account different routes by which these agents may be transmitted experimentally. Mouse scrapie aerosol transmission has been successfully obtained in mice Haybaeck et al. 2011) . In cervids, Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) was already proposed as a natural airborne pathogen (Denkers et al. 2010 ). In the case of Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease (CJD), there is to date no proof of release of prion into aerosols.",

For example, the expression of transgenes and production of proteins of interest whose function depends on methylation, sulfation, phosphorylation, lipid addition, or glycosylation may necessitate the capacity of higher eukaryotic cells to perform post-translational modifications. GM animal cell cultures may also be chosen for the replication of defective recombinant or even wild type viruses. The risk assessment of GM cells should follow the five-step methodology as outlined in Fig. 22 .1, which means that an evaluation of each individual aspect in the process of genetic modification should be performed. This includes an evaluation of the recipient cell, the vector, the donor organism properties and an assessment of the characteristics of the inserted genetic material. A comprehensive risk assessment of genetically modified cells expressing transgenes should also take into account the risk associated with the transgene products. A gene product may be intrinsically harmful (e.g. toxic properties) or could induce hazardous properties via its expression in GM cells, dependent upon the genome integration site, promoter activity and expression of regulatory sequences governing expression. The risk assessment for transgenes is not straightforward and demands appropriate consideration. Comprehensive reviews have specifically addressed this topic (Bergmans et al. 2008; van den Akker et al. 2013 ). Genetic modification may confer an expanded life-span, immortalisation or increased capacity for tumour induction. However, it is unlikely that recombinant properties obtained by genetic modification may have an adverse effect upon release of the recombinant animal or human cells into the environment. Cells (genetically modified or not) have difficulties to survive in a hostile environment where control of temperature and osmolality is lacking or where cell-specific nutrients (e.g. glucose, vitamins, lipids) are not balanced or missing. Hence, the survival of such primary cells or cell lines outside of proper conditions is unlikely to occur. Apart from the fact that GM cell cultures may harbour pathogens and pose serious biological risks to human health (as discussed above), recombinant cells are more likely to cause harm when entering the body of animals or humans. However, the extent of the harmful effect remains hard to predict. It should be kept in mind that the lack of histocompatibility between recombinant cells and the host organism remains a major obstacle for these cells to survive and to multiply as the natural immune response of the healthy (immunocompetent) host will recognise foreign cells and eventually destroy them. This is also one of the main reasons why the culturing of cells originating from the laboratory worker is not allowed for research and diagnostic activities (risk associated with autologous cells).",

These are established cell lines that are deliberately and stably transfected with \"helper constructs\" to ensure the replication and packaging of replication deficient viral vectors. For example, in case of retroviral packaging cell lines, the expression of \"helper genes\" allows high-level constitutive production of viral proteins (e.g. gag, pol and env proteins), which are missing in the genome of the replication deficient viral vector but are crucial for viral replication. One of the main biosafety issues related to the use of packaging cell lines is the fact that replication-competent viruses may be generated as a result of (homologous) recombination between the replication deficient viral vector and viral sequences present in the packaging cell. These events could result in the formation of viruses with novel yet unwanted properties such as the generation of replication-competent viruses. One of the strategies to engineer safer generations of packaging cell lines consists in minimising the likelihood of generating replication-competent viruses by separating viral functional elements into different expression plasmids, thereby increasing the number of recombination events necessary to generate replication-competent viruses (Dull et al. 1998) or by reducing or eliminating the sequence homology between the viral vector and the helper sequences. However, endogenous retrovirus genomes expressed in safer generations of retroviral packaging cell lines may still give rise to unwanted recombination events (Chong et al. 1998) . This means that the possibility to generate replication-competent viruses cannot be ruled out.",

For instance, while established cell lines inherently present low risks, large scale operations involving the culturing of large volumes (from 10 to 1,000 l) are prone to contamination when inadequate containment measures are applied. This is exemplified by continuous processes such as cell cultivation in bioreactors where an appropriate design of seals, valves, pumps and transfer lines is required to guarantee long-term sterility of the operation to avoid inadvertent contamination. At the opposite, the handling of cell cultures belonging to risk group 2 may present less risk once they have been fixed by glutaraldehyde or formaldehyde/acetone for immunostaining and may therefore require less stringent containment measures Manipulations that are common to research and diagnostic activities and warrant consideration with respect to the risk assessment of animal cell cultures are described hereunder:",

Some standard operating procedures and methods have also been described for ensuring the cell sorting under optimal biosafety conditions even under BSL3 conditions (Lennartz et al. 2005; Perfetto et al. 2011 ). -Altering culture conditions: changing the availability of cell-specific nutrients, growth factors, signal molecules or adopting co-culture techniques may have significant effects on animal cell cultures as it may result in altered neoplasia (Stoker et al. 1990 ), altered expression of (proto)onco-genes or cell surface glycoproteins and release of endogenous viruses (Cunningham et al. 2004) . As a consequence, changing culture conditions may lead to altered susceptibility of cultured cells to biologic agents such as viruses (Anders et al. 2003; Vincent et al. 2004 ). -Manipulations involving use of needles or sharps: due to injuries cell material may be accidentally transferred directly to an operator's tissue and/or blood stream. -In vivo experiments involving animals: major risks are self-inoculation (needlestick injury) and exposure to aerosols.",

If no well-characterised cell lines or SPF are available, tests for detection of likely contaminating agents should be negative.

            "text": "Biosafety is an internationally recognized concept referring to the maximal protection of laboratory workers, public health and the environment from the possible adverse effects associated to the use of organisms and microorganisms (genetically modified or not). Within this respect activities involving the use of animal cell cultures for fundamental research, R&D or in vitro diagnosis purposes pose biosafety considerations as well. Before starting any of such activities biosafety considerations should be addressed by performing a biological risk assessment allowing the identification and characterisation of any potential adverse effect together with an evaluation of the likelihood and consequences should any effect happen. Such an approach is made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the type of manipulation and the type of cell culture handled. A risk assessment will result in biosafety recommendations in view of the implementation of an adequate containment level. Considering the very limited persistence capacity of animal and human cells outside non-optimised culture conditions and the fact that many cell lines have a long history of safe use, it is generally considered unlikely that cell cultures may inherently cause harm to humans or the environment. The main hazard associated with the handling of animal cell cultures resides in the presence of adventitious pathogenic micro-organisms, which are often difficult to detect and hence less controllable. In contrast to their host cells, adventitious organisms can persist in more hostile conditions and may present risks for human health or the environment in case they are pathogenic (Bean et al. 1982; Walther and Ewald 2004; Kallio et al. 2006; Kramer et al. 2006) . For this reason, a risk assessment of cell cultures will frequently lead to a risk assessment of the potential adventitious contaminants, the organisms used for cell's immortalisation (viruses, viral sequences, etc.) and/or the microorganisms intentionally used to experimentally infect them. Though the assignment of biosafety containment level requirements cannot be generalised and should be performed on a case-by-case basis, it is recognised that most of the containment measures primarily aim at protecting cells from adventitious contamination in order to mitigate potential risks for the laboratory worker. Except for authenticated cell lines proved to present no risk, the activities involving cell cultures from human or primate origin should generally be performed under containment level 2 involving the use of a class II Biosafety cabinet and Good Laboratory Practice.",

These biorisk management (continued) measures (i.e. adoption of the appropriate containment level) can be coupled with the implementation of automation platforms allowing the reduction of cell culture cross-contamination and accidental contamination with infectious agents.",

They are used for the preparation of viral vaccines and are from human or monkey origin. Continuous cell lines Are immortalized cells that may survive almost infinite serial passages. These cells are obtained by either isolating cells from tumours (neoplastic origin), primary cells treated with mutagens, oncogenic viruses or recombinant DNA (oncogenes) or by cell fusioning of primary cells with a continuous cell line. As a consequence, the class of risk of these cell lines is often correlated to the class of risk of primary cells of whom they are derived. Due to the \"immortality\" of the continuous cell lines, their ability to induce tumours has also to be considered. Transfection Gene transfer of DNA in eukaryotic cells using non-viral delivery methods. Transduction Gene transfer of DNA in eukaryotic cells using viral vectors. Infection Process occurring when a virus (wild type) that typically replicates and spreads into neighbouring cells mediates a gene transfer belonging to its own genome or extra genes it may carry. Viral vector Is a protein particle derived from a replicative virus that contains genetic information in the form of RNA or DNA. A viral envelope may be present as well.",
