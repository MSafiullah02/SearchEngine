Observing the progression of the pandemic in its epicenter, in March, Shen & Bar-Yam, from the New England Complex Systems Institute (2020), estimated that an extreme lockdown of 5 weeks was sufficient to contain the COVID-19 epidemic in China, warning that a soft lockdown would be ineffective. The ideal lockdown coverage curbs new infections while it buys time for the virus to die out in individuals who are already infected, (1) significantly reducing the infected population, and (2) producing immunity barriers, thus interrupting infection spread (Kissler et al, 2020) . These predictions have been based on mathematical modeling using epidemic characteristics, such as initial reproductive number (R0) and effective reproductive number (Re) (Kissler et al., 2020; Zhao and Chen) , or epidemic growth rate (Wibens et al, 2020) As opposed to models based on linear equations, Network Models are adequate for realistic simulations of complex systems with dynamic behavior patterns, where the individual states of its units and the connections among them are intrinsically non-linear, and emulated by pseudo-random series (Haykin, 1994) .",

Moreover, these predictions would be important at least as motivation for the planning of public lockdown policies. Coverage is an objectifiable measure in terms of proportions (in %) for comparisons between scenarios with shared parameters, which has qualitative value. In the present evaluation, the most important parameter in this simulation is virus reproduction rate in a non-immune population (R0). R0 for COVID-19 had been estimated as 2.7 (Wu et al, 2020). However, new estimates on pandemic progression have obtained a R0 of 5.7 and a growth rate of 0.21-0.3/day (Sanche et al, 2020) . Other recent sources have indicated reproductive numbers of this magnitude (Bulut and Kato, 2020; Zhao and Chen, 2020) . Therefore, we developed a network model to estimate the effect of lockdown coverage intensity and coverage time on incidence curves of COVID-19 epidemic in a closed population (with no significant exchange of individuals from/to other populations). Our intention is to check how these two dimensions might comparatively affect amplitude and latency of peak incidence, as well as total number of cases.",

In other words, one way to prove the representativity of the model is comparing the coefficient of exponential growth of the incidence curve obtained with the incidence curve estimated for the actual epidemic. Adopting R0 values found in literature (Sanche et al., 2020) in this model (Ma et al, 2013) , we obtained incidence curves that fit (best-fit) an exponential with growth rate parameters that are nearly the same as those of the actual incidence curve. Using the exponential model (equation 4), we found r of 0.16 and 0.28, respectively, for R0 equal to 2.7 and 5.7, inside or near the respective intervals previously estimated for these R0 (Sanche et al, 2020) . Therefore, this model might be considered representative of the progression of an epidemic such as that of Even considering this model realistic and representative of the COVID-19 epidemic behavior, these simulations did not determine ideal parameters of lockdown coverage and time. Due to its validity, this model might possibly be useful for quantitative estimates in further studies .

Based on the results shown here, we might conclude that: (1) even in ideal lockdown coverage conditions (90%), only periods longer than 5 weeks would be effective to control the epidemic; (2) softer coverages would only be effective if the epidemic has a lower R0, and even so, for relatively longer periods; and (3) in epidemics with R0 relatively low, lockdowns with strong coverage did not flatten the curve, although they significantly delay the peak. In other words, R0 is a determining factor of lockdown characteristics, although lockdown duration is the less dependent factor on virus reproductive number; that is why the priority factor to be included in epidemic containment policies is: lockdown must be relatively long.",

We know that SARS-CoV2 is especially sensitive to heat (Le Page, 2020), and we are still in the hotter seasons in Brazil, which is unfavorable for the propagation of respiratory infections such as COVID (Kissler et al, 2020; Sun et al, 2020) . Therefore, due to climatic and seasonal characteristics of Brazil, it is possible that R0 is lower than that estimated for China, in wintertime. Hence, lockdown duration might be the determining factor for the epidemic, even with low coverage. On the other hand, early release of lockdown might trigger uncontrollable growth of the incidence curve.",
