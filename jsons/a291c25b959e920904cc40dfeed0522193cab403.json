As a result, COVID-19 had a moderate spread in the country, and subsequent the stretch on the healthcare system was avoided keeping the casualties at a deficient level. At the time of composing this communication, a total of 2,591 COVID-19 cases and 140 deaths (5.4% of all confirmed cases) have been recorded in Greece [5] . The prevalence of the disease was slightly higher in men than women (55% vs 45%), the mean age of COVID-19 cases was 49 years, while the mean age of those who lost their lives was 74 years [5] . The spread of the disease in Greece was higher in large and heavily populated urban areas but very limited in rural areas or islands as expected [5] . As the daily rate of confirmed cases has been critically reduced, and Greece is now planning the careful exit from the lock-down and return to normality, we can critically evaluate the two months elapsed between the beginning and the flattening of the pandemic curve, concerning Orthopaedic and Trauma services, in Greece.",

Orthopaedic and Trauma Departments were also radically reorganised. The wards of our hospital have been amalgamated to free staff and beds for COVID wards. All elective surgeries were cancelled in order to reduce admission load and the possibility of in-hospital transmission of the disease. Only oncological and trauma cases were admitted for surgery since the onset of the pandemic. The admission criteria of trauma and oncological cases were also modified; multidisciplinary oncology team approved patients and those with life, or limb-threatening injuries were admitted for surgery. Patients with non-life or limbthreatening injuries that required surgery were admitted if surgery was planned to happen soon. In any other case, patients were sent home and re-admitted for day-surgery when there was operating room availability. A large number of patients were treated conservatively.",

COVID-19 confirmed patients were directed through the isolated COVID-19 pathway to the COVID-19 (CO) negative pressure ward. A specially organised COVID-19 OR (CO-OR) near the CO ward was dedicated for surgical management. CO-OR was isolated, away from the regular NCO-OR, and operating with specific nursing, surgical, and anaesthetic experienced staff with a nearby satellite radiology suit organised explicitly for this purpose.",

When admission was deemed necessary, suspected COVID-19 patients remained to the SCO ward until the test result was available usually within 8-24 hours and then transferred to COVID or Non-COVID ward accordingly.",

The decrease in admission rate reached almost 90% compared to the admission rate of the same month of the previous year. The decreased admission rate was, to some extent, expected due to the imposed lock-down and social distancing measures as both limited physical and road traffic activity. The admission rate of the geriatric hip fractures was also reduced similarly; the latter however was not expected as the majority of them are domestic low energy injuries. It was speculated that the impact on lifestyle and psychology of the elderly citizens during the first phase of the epidemic was so critical that even indoors mobility and/or around the house was limited, reducing falls and osteoporotic hip fractures.",

Slow implementation, proper adaptation and the gradual return of citizens and medical staff to the new \"living with the COVID-19\" reality has been announced giving priority to safety and protection against pandemic relapse. Early instructions from the Greek Ministry of Health made the use of a face mask legally bounding in public space and hospitals [5] . Patients scheduled for elective surgery and all emergency trauma cases will be admitted in an isolated preadmission ward where a thorough preoperative evaluation will be executed; including clinical examination, RT-PCR molecular test in all cases, chest X-ray and if necessary, a chest CT scan. Antibody testing is not suitable for COVID-19 diagnostic screening and will only be used for epidemiological purposes and for the monitoring of immune status of the hospital staff. During the immediate post lock-down period and up to July 2020, only the 50% of the Orthopaedic cases including trauma, compared to the same months of 2019, will be allowed to be performed thus restricting the surgical activity in numerical order for protection purposes [5] . Inside OR induction and recovery schedule and the one-hour interval between cases will be necessary for thorough disinfection, changing and cleansing the anaesthesiology tubing and apparatuses. The outpatient clinics will also gradually return to normality and speed. In our hospital, 20 patients per clinic, comprising of ten follow-ups and ten new appointments, will be allowed for the first month.",
