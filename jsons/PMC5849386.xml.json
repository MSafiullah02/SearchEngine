Today, the liquid herbal drug preparation EPs 7630 from the roots of P. sidoides (1:8\u201310), extraction solvent: ethanol 11% (w/w), has been approved for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections (aRTI) in several countries in Europe, Asia, Australia, and Central and South America.",

The mode of action is described by Conrad et al15 and Janecki et al16 as an exertion of a specific antagonistic effect against the adhesion proteins on the bacterial surface (group A Streptococcus), thus preventing adhesion to epithelial cells and subsequent penetration of them. This specific activity appears to be mediated by the proanthocyanidins, which are contained in the extract. Another possible mechanism of protection could be linked to an increase in the ciliary motility of the respiratory epithelium, as shown by preliminary in vitro studies that assessed the effect of EPs 7630 on cultured human respiratory mucosa cells.17",

In the trial reported by Bereznoy et al,29 a significant difference between the TSS total score reduction rates measured in the EPs 7630 and in the placebo group, respectively, with superiority of the herbal drug extract, was already shown for the first interim visit (day 2). Furthermore, the onset of treatment effect as reported by the members of the active treatment group was significantly superior to placebo already by day 1\u20132 (23% vs 1.4%). Accordingly, the proportion of patients who did not need bed rest anymore by day 6 was 87.7% in the EPs 7630 group and 38.6% in the placebo group. Data obtained from the second RCT published by Berezhnoi et al30 furthermore revealed that the concomitant use of paracetamol during the trial was significantly lower in the EPs 7630 group than in the placebo group (1.6\u00b11.5 vs 2.8\u00b12.0, p=0.001, p-value of the two-sided Wilcoxon test). These results were confirmed by a recently published meta-analysis of the data19 obtained from these two trials. The meta-analysis also showed a significant advantage of EPs 7630 with regard to complete symptom recovery at day 4.",

Thus, a maximum TSS total score of 21 points was possible. As a dosing regimen, the active treatment group (40 children) received 20 drops of EPs 7630 hourly while awake (up to 12\u00d720 drops/d) on the first 2 days of treatment, and then 3\u00d720 drops/d on days 3\u20136.

The early use of EPs 7630 at the onset of signs of respiratory infection reduces or resolves symptoms more rapidly, reduces the risk of bacterial superinfection,15 allows more rapid functional recovery, and reduces the use of other drugs such as paracetamol,19 or, most importantly, antibiotics,22 to counter the increasingly worrying phenomenon of antibiotic resistance. EPs 7630 is well tolerated and can be used in children from the age of 1 year. Furthermore, its use could provide preventive action against clinical worsening or complications, while reducing the need for NSAIDs and antibiotics.",
