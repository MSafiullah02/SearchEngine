Only certain infectious diseases such as malaria, babesiosis, miliary tuberculosis, viral hepatitis, measles, histoplasmosis, brucellosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, human immunodeficiency virus, and septic shock are associated with lymphopenia.

In our recent experience, the degree and duration of relative lymphopenia in adult patients with influenza A are predictive of severe infection, that is, all patients required hospitalization. Because early severe relative lymphopenia is a characteristic laboratory finding in influenza A, the diagnosis of influenza A should be questioned in patients who do not have early and severe relative/absolute lymphopenia.5 Lymphopenia is a constant finding and is more common in influenza A than leukopenia or thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis in the patients with viral influenza should suggest a secondary bacterial pneumonia. Leukopenia has been described as a cardinal laboratory finding in influenza A but is not mentioned in major infectious disease textbooks.6, 7, 8\n",
