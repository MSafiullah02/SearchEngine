Recent discoveries have highlighted the importance of this cell in regulating health and disease and our understanding about immunity in the ocular microenvironment has grown exponentially in the last several years. The RPE cell orchestrates both innate and adaptive immunity and contains a plethora of factors to regulate the immune response [1]. Compelling evidence now suggests that immune activation of the RPE cell may have far reaching effects in retinal infections, autoimmunity and retinal degenerations, i.e. age related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy. As we review the varied ways in which the RPE cell influences ocular immunity, we will highlight possible mechanisms to explain how these responses impact vision.",

TLR recognition of these microbial patterns leads to a signal transduction cascade that generates a rapid and robust inflammatory response marked by cellular activation and the production of a variety of cytokines, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, cytokines that promote T cell differentiation, type 1 interferons and chemokines. Since their discovery in 1980, the TLR molecules have been described in numerous cell types throughout the body [3]. Currently, the human TLR family comprises ten TLRs and each is distinguished by their ligand specificity [3]. Also, each TLR has a unique location and expression pattern within the cell. For example, TLR3, 7 and 9 are located manly within the cellular endosome while the remaining TLRs (TLR2, 4, 5, 6) are found on the cell membrane. Overall, TLRs located on the cell membrane recognize bacterial products (i.e. TLR4 recognizes bacterial lipid A from Gram negative bacteria) while the intracellular TLRs detect viral or bacterial nucleic acids (i.e. TLR3 interacts with dsRNA formed during virus replication).",

It is not surprising that the RPE cell is endowed with many of the TLRs, since it is strategically situated and can provide a rapid defense system for the retina [4]. Analysis of TLR gene expression identified the presence of TLR1 through 7, 9 and 10 on human RPE cells. Interestingly, TLR3, a vital TLR for defense against virus infection, is the most highly expressed TLR on the RPE cell. TLR3 recognizes a dsRNA motif, an intermediate product of virus replication or an analog of dsRNA, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C). Analysis of signaling through TLR3 revealed that the RPE cell secreted several pro-inflammatory mediators, including, IL-6, IL-8 (CXCL8), MCP-1, ICAM-1, CXCL9, CXCL10 and VEGF [5]. These molecules provide signals for immune and retinal resident cells to activate and initiate inflammatory pathways. An important immunosuppressive cytokine, that is selectively upregulated by TLR3, is IFN-\u03b2. This cytokine and its unique interaction with the RPE cell will be discussed later.",

For example, TLR polymorphisms have been associated with AMD [6, 7]. Investigations exploring the utility of siRNA treatment for AMD, identified that siRNA signaled through TLR3 [8, 9]. This signaling process results in the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. These studies suggest a mechanism by which siRNA molecules can inhibit neovascularization in AMD. Also, the critical importance of the TLRs is underscored by recent investigations evaluating deficiencies in TLR. In a mouse model of diabetic retinopathy it was reported that a deficiency in TLR7 inhibits inflammation and this lack of TLR7 results in an attenuation of diabetic retinopathy [10].",

Klettner and associates found that TLR3 activation in RPE cells results in cell death partly mediated by JNK [13, 14]. Alternatively, studies have also demonstrated a protective role for TLR3 signaling. Patel and associates have shown that TLR3 signaling through a STAT3 dependent mechanism protects RPE cells from oxidative stress [15, 16]. Taken together, these studies illustrate the major position of the RPE in innate immunity and stress the plethora of responses TLR signaling affects. Future experiments are needed to better define the role of TLRs in human ocular diseases and to pinpoint additional strategies that limit or boost their function [12].",

Thus, because of their varied participatory roles, we recognize these molecules as powerful agents that control many aspects of health and disease and as potential therapeutic tools for variety of immune based disorders.

The RPE cell produces high levels of IL-6 in response to several stimuli, such as, infectious agents, other cytokines (IL-1 \u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and IFNs) and TLR ligation [18, 19]. As we have witnessed elsewhere in the body, the release of IL-6 by the RPE cell may be an important component of a chronic as well as acute inflammatory response in the retina. Based on the analysis of systemic diseases several studies have implicated the persistent production of IL-6 as a cytokine involved with the onset and development of autoimmunity [20, 21]. In order to better understand pathogenic mechanisms in autoimmune retinopathy (AIR), we evaluated the presence of cytokine markers in AIR patients. Recently, our laboratory identified the increased presence of IL-6 and CXCL9 in AIR patient sera and show that these elevated levels correlate with augmented disease severity. These studies provide evidence that IL-6 and CXCL9 may participate in AIR pathology [22]. A previous study using flow cytometric immunophenotyping to analyze this same cohort of patients noted that B-lymphocyte anomalies were described in AIR patient plasma compared to normal and uveitic patient samples [23]. Both of these observations hint that the immune response may play a role AIR. Nevertheless, additional investigations are needed to unravel the involvement of the immune response in this rare disease with the hope that more definitive guidelines for diagnosis and treatment strategy will be developed.",

The presence of chemokine expression in the retina has been associated with a number of retinal disorders. Numerous studies have revealed that within the retina, the RPE cell provides high levels of IL-8, MCP-1 and CXCL9 and CXCL10. IL-8, often identified as one of the early inflammatory mediators following injury, is a potent chemoattractant and activator of neutrophils. In addition, IL-8 promotes the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells and possesses strong angiogenic properties within the eye. Another chemokine that directs monocytes, memory T cells and dendritic cells to an inflammatory site and is associated with neovascularization, is CCL2 ( MCP-1). Like IL-8, this chemokine has also been implicated in number of disorders within the retina. Not long ago, Chan and colleagues demonstrated in an animal model that CCL2 was associated with AMD. The authors show that mice deficient in CCL2 develop a retinal disease that mimics human AMD [25].",

CXCL9 and CXCL10 are interferon inducible chemokines that interact with their receptor, CXCR3, on the surface of T cells and NK cells resulting in the migration and activation of these cells into inflamed sites. Following the first description of these two chemokines by Detrick et al., in a degenerative disease, experimental coronavirus retinopathy (ECOR), Nawaz and collaborators also detected both CXCL9 and CXCL10 on retinal endothelial cells in human diabetic retinopathy [26, 27]. Additional chemokine signaling studies were reported in a rodent model of degeneration by Rutar and associates. These investigators found that CXCL10 was present in this model system and was responsible for the chemokine mediated inflammation observed [28, 29].",

During the course of AMD, both MAC and C5a have been described to accumulate in drusen and in RPE [34, 35].

Regulation of the immune system is clearly an important area of research. In fact, studies identifying how tumor cells escape immune destruction by the PD-L1 pathway has led to exciting novel cancer treatment strategies. The concept of regulatory mechanisms in the ocular microenvironment that restrain immune-mediated inflammation is not new. Over 70 years ago, Sir Peter Medawar identified the concept of immune privilege in the brain, eye and the pregnant uterus [46]. Today, we know that immune privilege extends to the anterior chamber as well as the retina where an array of regulatory mechanisms act in concert to prevent immunologic inflammation and maintain tissue integrity [47, 48]. Some of these mechanisms include the presence of a blood-retinal barrier, a lack of lymphatic drainage, the presence of immunosuppressive cytokines and regulatory T cells. Controlling unnecessary inflammation is not an immunologically inert activity but rather a very active process that allows the eye to escape the damage associated with a full blown inflammatory response. Today, we recognize that the RPE cell is a major player in this dynamic regulatory pathway.",

An outline of the immune-protective role of the RPE cell is seen in Figs. 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4. The RPE cell releases three suppressive factors including TGF-\u03b2, IL-11 and IFN-\u03b2. One of these molecules highly expressed in the RPE cell is IFN-\u03b2 [5, 6]. It is well known that the IFNs are involved in numerous immune reactions and induction of type 1 IFN gene expression is an essential part of innate immunity [4]. Since the RPE cell continuously expresses high levels of IFN-\u03b2 through IRF-7 up-regulation, our laboratory explored ways in which this molecule may function in the retinal microenvironment (Fig. 6.2). In vitro experiments and in vivo studies show that IFN-\u03b2 acts as an immunosuppressive cytokine to block immune reactivity and thus protect the retinal tissue from excessive damage and visual loss [6]. IFN-\u03b2 provides this protection in two ways. IFN-\u03b2 can down-regulate CXCL9 and the adhesion molecule, ICAM-1. The net effect of this activity would be a \u201ctightening\u201d of the blood retinal barrier and decreased ocular inflammation [49].",

Next, our in vitro studies demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 treatment up-regulated both class I and class II molecules on normal RPE cells and hence equipped the cell to participate as a resident APC in the retina [60, 61]. In a series of in vitro studies we demonstrated that both retinal and non-retinal (BCG) antigens can be processed and presented by the activated RPE cell [60]. These finding were an essential first step underscoring the important role of the RPE cell in inflammatory, infectious and degenerative disorders .

Using this model system, our laboratory tracked the expression of the MHC class II molecules on RPE cells and recorded the entry of inflammatory cells into the retina [63]. Moreover, following the administration of anti-MHC class II antibody prior to EAU induction, we observed that this treatment limited the expression of MHC class II molecules on RPE cells, reduced the severity of disease and significantly delayed the onset of EAU.

This is the first retinal model to demonstrate a virus-induced degeneration, viral persistence, a genetic predisposition to virus-induced tissue damage and a virus triggered autoimmune response. ECOR is a retinal degenerative disease that is composed of three basic components; a virus component, a genetic component and an immunologic component [64\u201366]. Our early studies showed that inoculation of the neurotrophic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) into the vitreous or anterior chamber of BALB/c mice resulted in two distinct patterns of retinal pathology. The early phase of the disease, day 1\u20138, was characterized by retinal vasculitis and perivasculitis. The late phase of the disease, after day 10, was characterized by retinal degenerative changes. The retinal layers revealed disorganization with large areas of outer and inner segment loss. In addition, the RPE cells were morphologically abnormal with foci of RPE cell swelling, proliferation and cell atrophy [67, 68]. During this infection, we also noted that the RPE cell was the first cell infected by the virus [64, 65, 69, 70]. This was not unexpected since the RPE cell serves as an excellent reservoir for numerous pathogens. Analysis of retinal gene expression and protein expression identified the early up-regulation of cytokines and chemokines, including, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFNs, CXCL9, CXCL10 and ICAM-1 [26, 71]. The presence of IFN-\u03b3 was also detected in the serum and served as the rational for the enhanced expression of MHC class I and II molecules on the RPE cell.",

            "text": "The susceptible strain of mice, BALB/c, were not the only rodent strain examined. CD-1 mice were extensively studied after coronavirus infection. During the early phase of the disease (day 1\u20138) both strains of mice showed that the virus infected and replicated within the retina and this was associated with a typical retinal vasculitis. However, on day 10\u2013140, only the BALB/c mice experienced the late phase of the disease marked by retinal degeneration. In contrast, in the resistant strain, CD-1 mice, the retina reverted to a normal architecture. We have identified two key differences between the mouse strains that contributed to this retinal degeneration. First, a distinct difference in the intensity of the innate immune response was observed in these mice that developed a retinopathy compared to the mice without late retinal disease. At day 2 and 3 the BALB/c mice had extremely high levels of IFN-\u03b3, CXCL9 and CXCL10 which was measured by retinal gene expression. These same elevated levels of cytokines were found in the serum [26]. When CXCL9 and CXCL10 interact with its receptor, CXCR3 on T cells and NK cells, immune cells migrate to specific targets, in this case to the retina. The second distinct difference was the observation that the retinal degenerative process in BALB/c mice was associated with the presence of antiretinal autoantibodies. These antibodies were directed against the neural retina and the RPE cell. In contrast, these autoantibodies were not detected in the sera from normal or mock injected BALB/c mice. Likewise, none of the CD-1 mice developed antiretinal antibodies [66]. These mice also produced significantly lower levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10. Therefore, the mice that failed to develop antiretinal antibodies also failed to develop a retinal degeneration. These findings suggest a role for autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of ECOR and illustrate how a robust innate immune response may contribute to a heightened adaptive immune response that leads to a retinal degeneration. This model recapitulates key elements of human retinal degenerative diseases and serves as a template for exploring basic mechanisms of this degenerative process .",

One evolutionally conserved epitope that we identified that was specific only to RPE cells was termed, RPE65 [73, 74]. This molecule has subsequently been the subject of active genetic research. Mutations in the RPE65 gene have been identified in Leber\u2019s Congenital Amaurosis.

The RPE cell orchestrates both innate and adaptive immunity and possesses molecules that can limit these responses. The regulation of immunity and hemostasis within the retina through cytokine production, TLR activation, complement regulators and APC properties are all key elements in the RPE cell\u2019s inventory. Continuing investigations of these immune related components, their complex regulatory networks and their various antagonists will allow even more discoveries and provide additional clues to inform about mechanisms that can lead to future treatments for many human retinal diseases.",
