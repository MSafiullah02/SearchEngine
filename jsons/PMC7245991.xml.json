Up to now, there are no specific therapeutic agents for coronavirus infections. Lopinavir\u2013ritonavir treatment recently failed to demonstrate any significant outcome benefit, but the study was underpowered to rule out clinically meaningful treatment effects, and the intervention was started a median of 13 days after symptoms onset [1]. In vitro inhibition of virus spread has been reported with chloroquine prior to or after SARS-CoV-2 infection [2]. Hydroxychloroquine has been found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [3] and a recent report suggested that 70% of 20 non-ICU hydroxychloroquine-treated patients had negative PCR results in nasopharyngeal samples at day 6 (D6) post-inclusion [4] and in all the 6 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination (hydroxychloroquine\u2013azithromycin) [4]. In order to evaluate these results in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, we retrospectively assessed in moderate-to-severe ARDS the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine\u2013azithromycin combination regarding viral disappearance at both day 6 of the treatment and day 6 of evolution of ARDS as compared with patients treated with lopinavir\u2013ritonavir and a control group without any anti-viral treatment.",

Patients were admitted to 4 ICUs in 2 different regions of France from March 2nd to March 31st. In one ICU, they received hydroxychloroquine\u2013azithromycin as a usual policy while this combination was maintained if started prior to admission in the second ICU (the other patients receiving lopinavir\u2013ritonavir). Controls were treated in 2 other ICUs with antibiotics targeting bacterial community acquired pneumonia only. In all patients, nasopharyngeal PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were performed at the time of diagnosis and then regularly during ICU stay in order to assess viral clearance. Results of PCR were qualitative at the beginning of the pandemic, then quantitative and expressed by the PCR cycle threshold (CT).",

At day 6 following ARDS onset, PCR was negative in only 9 patients, 5 from the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group, 2 from the hydroxychloroquine\u2013azithromycin group and 2 from the control group. When considering only the patients that had received an anti-viral treatment within the 5 days following the onset of COVID-19 symptoms, we found that none of them (0/7) had a negative PCR 6 days after the beginning of treatment in the hydroxychloroquine\u2013azithromycin group as compared with 3/7 (43%) in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group (p = 0.05). At day 6 following ARDS, mortality was 4.4%, all survivors being under mechanical ventilation (MV) with no difference regarding ventilatory parameters, use of adjuvants and SOFA score. The latest follow-up done 38 \u00b1 7 days following treatment onset revealed that 37 patients were still alive (82%), 12 (92%) in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group, 15 (88%) in the hydroxychloroquine\u2013azithromycin group and 10 (67%) in the control group.

No difference in SARS-CoV-2 PCR negativity was found between groups 6 days after meeting moderate-to-severe ARDS criteria. Groups were comparable, except for a higher severity at admission in control patients, who were more frequently transferred to the ICU only when requiring MV, because of the massive influx of patients in this region of France. Although a positive PCR is not synonymous with active viral development, these results highlight the fact that neither of the treatments was able to achieve a rapid viral clearance in ARDS patients, as it has been suggested in one report on non-severe patients [4]. Waiting for the results of ongoing randomized controlled trials, clinicians should prescribe these treatments taking into account the paucity of the current rationale and the risk\u2013benefit ratio in severe forms. Moreover, considering the lack of viral clearance in the most severe patients, the use of immunosuppressive drugs should be carefully balanced in this population [5].",
