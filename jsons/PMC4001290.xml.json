The log-rank test was used to compare univariable hazards of time-to-event outcomes between disease categories.

The same risk factors as well as PIV type were also significant for mortality from respiratory failure (Table 4). Among white blood cell populations, a monocyte count <100 cells/\u00b5L was identified as the most important factor for mortality in the multivariable analysis (Table 5). These results were similar to those obtained from patients with only proven LRTD, except that low monocyte counts become a significant risk factor for overall mortality in a multivariable analysis (adjusted HR [aHR], 2.01; 95% CI, 1.1\u20133.8; P = .029).

            "text": "Numerous studies of respiratory viruses in immunocompromised hosts have examined LRTD either as an endpoint or a risk factor for mortality. However, previously published results for both the incidence and risk factors for progression and outcome vary widely [3\u20136, 11, 12]. Data presented here suggest that the variance in definitions of LRTD is one important reason for the observed differences. To address this issue, we conducted the present study to define the optimized diagnostic criteria that correlate with outcome. Based on the site of virologic detection and clinical manifestations, we classified LRTD into 3 groups (possible, probable, and proven). The recently published Fourth European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL-4) guidelines also proposed a classification based on levels of certainty (possible, probable, confirmed) [15]. However, the ECIL-4 classification is for all respiratory viruses, applies to both UTRI and LRTD, and uses symptoms, exposure, and any viral detection (independent of site) as classifiers. In contrast, our classification is strictly among LRTD cases that were all virologically confirmed [15]. In our paper, we specifically focused on the \u201cpossible\u201d category, which includes patients with nasopharyngeal tests demonstrating PIV infection and abnormal chest radiography, but without confirmation of virus in the lower respiratory tract. Numerous publications as well as society guidelines have generally accepted that these patients have LRTD [5\u20138, 11, 15\u201319]. Our data demonstrate that the mortality in patients with possible LRTD is significantly better than that in patients with probable and proven disease (Figure 1C and 1D) and similar to that of patients with URTI (Table 2). The effect was persistent throughout the study period (data not shown). Interestingly, possible LRTD patients without symptoms tended to have even better outcome than URTI (Supplementary Data). Nevertheless, many studies include this category as LRTD [6\u20138, 16, 17]. Therefore, we suggest that this group we defined as \u201cpossible\u201d LRTD should be separated from the patient group with viral detection in the lung (proven and probable LRTD cases). We developed our definitions a priori based on clinical practices across centers and the spectrum of definitions used in the literature. The \u201cpossible\u201d and \u201cproven\u201d categories are by far the most common categories documented, both in our series and elsewhere. Bronchoscopy based on PIV detection in the upper respiratory tract and the presence of LRTD symptoms or significant signs of obstruction by spirometry (\u201cprobable\u201d category) was performed during the 1990s at our center, but it has become very uncommon in recent years. Nevertheless, these patients are informative as their outcome appears to be similar to that seen in proven cases.",

Indeed, most studies and guidelines of non-PIV respiratory viruses include \u201cpossible\u201d cases in their definitions of LRTD [7, 15\u201319]. Additional studies are needed to extend these results to other respiratory virus infections. More than a decade ago, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) established the standard definitions for invasive fungal disease [20, 21]. These guidelines are widely accepted [22, 23], and resulted in improved reproducibility of study results between centers. These guidelines have greatly aided consensus endpoint definitions for clinical trials in invasive fungal disease. As new drugs for some respiratory viruses including PIV (eg, DAS181) are advancing through clinical development [24, 25], careful consideration of LRTD definitions that correlate with outcome is as important as clinical trial endpoints, entry criteria, and stratification variables.",

In our study, however, lymphocyte counts appeared to be less important than monocyte or neutrophil counts, and monocytes seemed to comprise an important cell component (Tables 4 and 5). Indeed, patients who were both monocytopenic and required oxygen at diagnosis of LRTD had a particularly high mortality (Figure 3). Monocytes have been known to be important to protect from viral infections [27\u201331]. Neutrophils may also have an important role at the time of pneumonia, and these 2 cells interact with each other [32\u201334].

Previous studies suggested that steroid use was associated with high mortality [5, 6, 12]. Our results showed that steroid use of \u22642 mg/kg/day after PIV LRTD was not associated with mortality. Based on our results, high-dose steroids for acute lung injury are not recommended, and a rapid taper of steroids for graft-vs-host disease may not be required when lower doses are used.",

Previous reports showed conflicting results ranging from no apparent efficacy on mortality after PIV LRTD [3\u20136, 12, 35], to moderate efficacy [36\u201339]. Most studies had a small sample size, and no statistical adjustments were made for disease severity. Thus, the effect of ribavirin is still controversial [40]. Our results show conflicting results for ribavirin treatment. Although the overall mortality model suggested a survival benefit among patients with proven and probable LRTD (Table 5), no significant effect was seen for death due to respiratory failure and for patients with proven LRTD. Some important variables such as high-dose steroids or the effect of combination therapy with IVIG could not be adequately assessed due to the small number of the patients with proven/probable LRTD who received these treatment combinations.",

However, the association of quantitative RNA viral load on mortality after PIV LRTD has not been well evaluated. In our study, BAL samples that were also positive by conventional methods generally had a higher viral load (Supplementary DataA), consistent with previous reports in nasal wash samples [13]. The results also show that the \u201cproven\u201d and \u201cprobable\u201d disease categories do not differ with regard to viral load and that the presence of clinical LRTD symptoms was not associated with higher viral load (Supplementary DataB). These findings provide support for combining both groups in outcome analyses, as proposed in this study. Our results did not identify RNA viral load in the BAL as a significant factor for mortality, although the number of subjects with available viral load was relatively small.",

Although this study is the largest cohort of confirmed PIV infections in HCT recipients (which includes our previously reported cases [4] as well as subsequent cases through 2011), the sample size was still not sufficient to perform multivariable analyses to evaluate the impact of LRTD disease categories or the effect of combination of several drugs on mortality. Because of the retrospective nature of the study, BAL samples were available in only half of the patients for viral load quantification, which limited the multivariable modeling. The use of bronchoscopy for the workup of LRTD is largely based on protocols at our center, with almost all patients undergoing this procedure when radiographic signs or LRTD symptoms occur. Nevertheless, the final decision to perform bronchoscopy rests with the attending physician and some patients may not have undergone this procedure. Therefore, some probable or proven cases may have been missed, but this is unlikely to affect the major results of this study.",
