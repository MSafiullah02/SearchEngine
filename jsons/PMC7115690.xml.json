The boundaries of regions have become open, fuzzy or elastic, leading to the emergence of cross-border regions across state borders. The dramatic spatial restructuring spurs the emergence of new forms of regional governance, such as urban networks and cross-border partnership, in response to challenges posed by globalization (Arndt et al., 2000, Heeg et al., 2003, Katz, 2000). The political-economic geography of world cities extends well beyond the jurisdictional reach of the local state to reconfigure political\u2013territorial alliances on multiple scales of their host states (Brenner, 1999, Church and Reid, 1996, Vogel et al., 2010).",

            "text": "The Great Pearl River Delta (PRD) as a sub-national region, consisting of Hong Kong, Macau and PRD region in South China, is currently experiencing an unprecedented process of regionalization as part of the wide processes of East Asia regionalization. A cross-boundary Hong Kong\u2013Shenzhen metropolis is emerging as a new economic space under the institution framework of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d (OCTS) (Yang, 2005a, Shen, 2008a). This paper aims to explore the evolution of regionalization in Hong Kong\u2013Shenzhen cross-boundary region using the new regionalism approach. It needs to clarify some concepts first \u2013 regionalization, integration, regionalism, new regionalism and regional cooperation. In the literature, regionalization means the formation of regional groupings and is an advanced stage of regional integration. The process of regionalization can be understood in two dimensions \u2013 economic integration and political\u2013institutional integration (Higgott, 1997, Sasuga, 2004). Economic integration means enhanced economic relations while political\u2013institutional integration means the establishment of formal political\u2013institutional arrangements especially at the governmental level. (Old)Regionalism was a \u201cstate-led phenomenon, which simplified the definition of the macro-region into being a result from some sort of cooperation between a group of contiguous states (Hettne, 2003, p. 23)\u201d. In contrast, new regionalism stresses an open and multi-dimensional system in which multiple (state and non-state) actors participate in regional projects (So, 2006). Similarly, regional cooperation means economic and/or institutional partnership and is an important part of regionalization.",

In the literature, Hong Kong\u2013Shenzhen integration, and Hong Kong\u2013PRD regional integration in general, is understood both from the economic and political dimensions. On the economic dimension, Hong Kong\u2013Shenzhen/PRD integration has been well documented in the literature from various perspectives including the new international division of labor, international commodity chains, cross-border production networks, social networks based on kinship ties (Leung, 1993, Lin, 1997, Shen, 2003, Sit, 1998). The market players played a critical role in Hong Kong\u2013Shenzhen economic integration in the form of cross-boundary investment during the past three decades (Shen, 2008a, Yang, 2005a). In recent years, increasing attention has been directed to the political or institutional dimension of regionalization. These studies include the changing relationship between Hong Kong and the PRD/Shenzhen (Shen, 2008b), the multi-level governance in the cross-boundary region (Yang, 2005b), the role of Hong Kong government in the cross-boundary urban governance (Shen, 2004, Shen, 2008a). Between above spectrum, Sum examined the sub-regionalism of Greater China from the integrated perspective of economic and political dimensions (Sum, 2001, Sum, 2002a, Sum, 2002b). She investigated cross-scale regionalization of Greater China by introducing two concepts \u2013 \u201ctime-space envelopes\u201d (TSEs) and \u201ctime-space governance\u201d (TSG). She argued that the close connection between the geo-economic and nationalist TSEs was the dominating force underlying the rise of Greater China\u2019s sub-regional model of growth (Sum, 2001). These studies facilitate our understanding of regionalization in Hong Kong\u2013PRD/Shenzhen region.",

Regional formation is seen as a dialectic outcome of society, market and state interactions. Polanyi (1957) argued that there are \u201cdouble movements\u201d, the expansion and deepening of the market system (the first movement) is followed by a political intervention (the second movement) in defense of society. The double movement thesis emphasizes contraction and change in the regional formation. The first movement involves a deliberate institutionalization of market exchange and the destruction of institutions built for social protection, which is also called \u201cde-regulation\u201d. However, the first movement threatens the power of territorial organizations and induces turbulence and social unrest. But the territorial logic is not dismantled with the rise of new regional entities (Popescu, 2008). Various political forces attempt to resist the process of globalization in order to ensure territorial control, cultural diversity, and human security (Hettne, 2003). This leads to territorial state\u2019s attempts of re-regulation. Thus regionalism will enter the second movement and new institutions are created in response to the new political economy. Due to increasing competition and globalization, the regional scale becomes more important than national or supra-national scale for responding to new political economy (Brenner, 1999). Hettne (2003) uses \u201ca second great transformation\u201d or the \u201creturn of the political\u201d to refer to the increase of various political forces in shaping the course of regionalization.",

In the earliest history of regional space, people lived in small isolated communities with little contact. Subsequently, trans-local relations between previously more isolated communities were developed, leading to the emergence of regional complex. At this second level of regionness, the trans-local relations are widened. Nation-building leads to a temporary decline in the level of regionness due to the consolidation of national territories and the inward orientation of nation states such as the post-colonial creation of states in Asia and Africa after the Second World War. When the states take more open stances to external relations, the degree of cross-border contact may increase. However, the sense of regionness is still weak at this level. Exchanges and economic interactions are unstable, short-sighted and based on self-interest, rather than expectations of economic reciprocity, social communication and mutual trust (Hettne & S\u00f6derbaum, 2000).",

Multi-dimensional regionalization occurs in economic, political and cultural dimensions spontaneously or through formalized regional cooperation with intensive interaction and communication among state and non-state actors. This level of regionness can be seen as a regional form of an \u201cinternational society\u201d of cooperating states (Bull, 1977). The state is still the dominant actor at this level of regionness, but interdependence is increasing and its inward orientation is relaxed. The regional society can be either organized or more spontaneous in cultural, economic, political or military fields. Two types of regions, formal region and informal region, thus emerge under different dynamics of regionalization. This paper argues that Hong Kong\u2013Shenzhen region went through three sub-stages of regional society after the late 1970s, namely, the emergence of informal regional society from below, the transitional regional society and formal regional society, with increasing role of the Hong Kong government in the process of regionalization.",

The EU is a laboratory for building the regional institutionalized polity. It should be mentioned that a regional institutionalized polity is not bound to emerge due to the existence of a strong civil society, the accumulation of social capital and other institutional arrangements at the region. Sometimes, new forms of governance or looser alliances could be other possible ways to cement various regional interests.

It simplifies the complexities of regionalization, making the comparative analysis of emerging regions and the understanding of regionalism easier. As regionness is an endogenous approach to understanding contemporary regionalism, it must be combined with an exogenous approach to show how globalization and regionalization processes interact under different conditions of regionness, creating a variety of pathways of regionalization (Hettne, 2003). The concepts of regionness and new regionalism have been developed by Hettne and his colleagues originally for world regions and macro-regionalization, such as the EU, North America and Asia Pacific, in the field of international relations and international political economy. However, they have been widely used on sub-national regions, micro-regions or cross-border regions in other academic disciplines such as geography, regional studies and urban planning. Hettne and S\u00f6derbaum (2000) also attempted to integrate macro-regions (consisting of nation states) and micro-regions (sub-national regions and cross-border regions) into the regionness concept. They argue that macro-regionalism and micro-regionalism are closely related. In East Asia, macro-regionalism has made slow progress while micro-regionalism is significant. Sub-regionalism or micro-regionalism in Greater China has been well documented in the literature (Sasuga, 2004, Sum, 2001, Sum, 2002a, Sum, 2002b). Sum\u2019s work on the emerging time-space governance of the Greater China\u2019s cross-boundary region is an important reference for understanding the relationship between Hong Kong, Taiwan and South China, especially the relationship between Hong Kong and the PRD region before the 1997 handover (Sum, 2002b). This paper will focus on the micro-regionalism in Hong Kong\u2013Shenzhen region.",

These interviews focused on the context of Hong Kong\u2013Shenzhen development, the latest policies on Hong Kong\u2013Shenzhen cooperation, cross-boundary area development plans, opinion on two cities\u2019 cooperation and competition. These informants provided very useful information for this study as supplements for the above two questionnaire surveys.",

Hong Kong was formerly a British colony and was returned to China\u2019s sovereignty as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) in 1997. The framework of OCTS has been implemented in Hong Kong since then. Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy, with independent executive, legislative and judicial power. Shenzhen as Hong Kong\u2019s north neighboring city was designed as a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) by the central government in 1979, with the intention of attracting foreign investment as well as preparing for the return of Hong Kong (Wu, 1997). In the administrative hierarchy, Shenzhen is a prefecture-level city under the administration of Guangdong Province. Shenzhen has grown from a small frontier town with a population of less than 30 thousand in 1978 to one of the top cities with a population over 10 million in China. Its GDP reached US$ 120.1 billion in 2009, about 57.0% of Hong Kong. Shenzhen was ranked as the second most competitive city in China in 2006\u20132010, only after Hong Kong (Ni et al., 2010). Under the framework of OCTS, capitalist Hong Kong and socialist Shenzhen have different institutional bases, which are called asymmetric urban governance (Shen, 2008a). Hong Kong government adopts a \u201cpositive non-intervention policy\u201d, while Shenzhen government adopts a \u201cdevelopmental state\u201d approach to urban economy. Overall, the cross-boundary relationship between Hong Kong and Shenzhen is very similar to those trans-border cities and EUROREGION in the EU (Heddebaut, 2004). Their integration can be analyzed through the lens of new regionalism.",

The central government of China was very active in promoting economic integration. It introduced open-door policy to expand and develop new production platforms and markets by attracting FDI including those from Hong Kong and Taiwan. Shenzhen SEZ, as well as other coastal cities, was designated as a pioneering site by the central government with various policy incentives. Shenzhen thus became a new geo-economic time-space to re-connect China to the regional and global systems (Sum, 2002a, Sum, 2002b). Therefore, the national government of China played an important role in creating initial conditions for the development of cross-boundary Hong Kong\u2013Shenzhen metropolis (Perkmann & Sum, 2002). In contrast, the colonial Hong Kong government was passive on economic integration.

Anti-integration was popular among many officials, businessmen and residents. This has political, social and economic reasons. First, politically, there was disagreement on Hong Kong\u2013PRD integration within Hong Kong SAR government. The government was divided into two camps with opposite views on the cross-boundary cooperation/integration (Shen, 2004). Some officials were concerned that close economic integration could undermine the political autonomy of Hong Kong SAR. Thus Hong Kong SAR government did not actively move toward cooperation. Second, it was recognized that local and international confidence in the future of Hong Kong was fragile during the early years after 1997. Many Hong Kong residents were worried that close integration may cause potential interference in Hong Kong\u2019s internal affairs by the Chinese government and change their capitalist way of life (Shen, 2004). Third, on economic aspects, some interest groups, including real estate developers, homeowners and retailers, worried about the potentially negative economic impact on Hong Kong caused by close cross-boundary integration.",

            "text": "The worst is always a turning point for better. The Fortress Hong Kong mentality began to dismantle from the mid-2003 and Hong Kong SAR government began to rethink its relationship with the mainland. Such a change has external and internal reasons. First, with close connections with the global economy, Hong Kong\u2019s policy making is much dependent on its external conditions and needs to make reference to other localities\u2019 strategies and actions (Ho, 2000). In the period of post-1997 AFC, Hong Kong faced heavy urban competition from cities in the Greater China. Taking the strategy of \u201cSiliconization\u201d as an example, almost all localities in the Greater China attempted to re-position themselves as \u201cthe next silicon valley\u201d (Sum, 2002a, Sum, 2002b). Although Hong Kong proposed to develop itself into an \u201ce-hub\u201d (Jessop & Sum, 2000), Taiwan and cities in South China also sought similar strategies, for examples, Taiwan as a \u201cscience inland\u201d and Shenzhen as a \u201cgateway for information technologies\u201d (Sum, 2002a, Sum, 2002b). On the other hand, Hong Kong was no longer the only pacemaker/gateway for China, with rapid economic development, further reform and opening in the mainland China. The growing Yangtze River Delta region, especially the emergence of Shanghai as international shipping center and international financial center, challenges the position of Hong Kong as an international logistics center and international financial center to some degree (Huang, 2009, Jiang and Shen, 2010). Since 2007, Shanghai port has surpassed Hong Kong port in terms of container throughput, becoming the second largest container port in the world (Fig. 2\n). Hong Kong\u2019s neighboring cities, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, no longer position themselves as the \u201cback factory\u201d of Hong Kong (Yeung, Shen, & Zhang, 2006). Shenzhen has proposed to develop the headquarters economy, and build itself into a regional financial center and a logistics center in Asia-Pacific region in its strategy of Shenzhen 2030. Shenzhen port will catch up Hong Kong port soon (Fig. 2). Guangzhou is very aggressive in building competitiveness and attempts to regain its position as the \u201cdragon head\u201d of South China (Xu & Yeh, 2005). A large number of mega-projects have been initiated by Guangzhou since 2000. Guangzhou made massive investment in infrastructure such as metro system in preparing the Asian Games in 2010. Under such a competitive context, a debate on whether Hong Kong was being marginalized emerged among Hong Kong\u2019s top officials and scholars. The Bauhinia Foundation Research Centre, a think-tank of Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, released a policy research report titled China\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan: Opportunities and Challenges for Hong Kong in 2006. The report suggested that Hong Kong should take an active stance in cross-boundary cooperation in order to maintain Hong Kong\u2019s competitiveness in a globalizing era (Yeung et al., 2006).",

To help Hong Kong\u2019s economy, the Central Government has introduced a series of preferential policies. In June 2003, the Central Government and Hong Kong SAR Government signed the first bilateral free-trade agreement \u2013 the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). It covers three aspects: trade in goods, trade in services, and trade and investment facilitation. Under the CEPA, the potentially huge market of the mainland is opened in advance of all foreign investors to Hong Kong investors with lower entrance thresholds than China\u2019s commitments to WTO (World Trade Organization) (Yeung & Shen, 2008). Taking trade in goods as an example, almost all Hong Kong domestic exports to the mainland enjoyed zero tariffs. Only in the first two years of implementation, Hong Kong\u2019s businesses saved a total of around HK$ 240 million in tariffs (Hong Kong SAR Government, 2006). In addition, the Individual Visit Scheme was also introduced by the Central Government in 2003 to boost tourism in Hong Kong. Prior to the scheme, mainland visitors could only travel to Hong Kong on business visas or in group tours. Under this scheme, residents in 43 mainland cities are allowed to visit Hong Kong on an individual basis. Such scheme has greatly stimulated the growth of tourism industry for Hong Kong. It was estimated that tourist income generated by the scheme reached over HK$ 60 billion in 2004, accounting for 55% of the total income of the industry (Yeung et al., 2006). It is clear that Hong Kong\u2019s economic recovery has greatly benefited from supports from the Central Government.",

They are airport cooperation and joint development of Lok Ma Chau Loop area and two joint task forces were set up in December 2007 respectively. Regarding the airport cooperation, two airports are complementary (Vogel et al., 2010, chap. 10). Hong Kong and Shenzhen airports mainly offer international and domestic flights respectively. According to Shenzhen airport\u2019s statistics, 3 million mainland visitors to Hong Kong used Shenzhen airport in 2006, accounting for 22.1% of the total mainland visitors to Hong Kong. Many mainland people, especially those in Shenzhen and other cities in the PRD, often use Hong Kong airport for their international trips. Therefore, airport cooperation has become a priority for inter-city cooperation.",
