            "text": "\u2020 Background Metallopeptidases of the M1 family are found in all phyla (except viruses) and are important in the cell cycle and normal growth and development. M1s often have spatiotemporal expression patterns which allow for strict regulation of activity. Mutations in the genes encoding M1s result in disease and are often lethal. This family of zinc metallopeptidases all share the catalytic region containing a signature amino acid exopeptidase (GXMXN) and a zinc binding (HEXXH[18X]E) motif. In addition, M1 aminopeptidases often also contain additional membrane association and/or protein interaction motifs. These protein interaction domains may function independently of M1 enzymatic activity and can contribute to multifunctionality of the proteins. \u2020 Scope A brief review of M1 metalloproteases in plants and animals and their roles in the cell cycle is presented. In animals, human puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA) acts during mitosis and perhaps meiosis, while the insect homologue puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PAM-1) is required for meiotic and mitotic exit; the remaining human M1 family members appear to play a direct or indirect role in mitosis/cell proliferation. In plants, meiotic prophase aminopeptidase 1 (MPA1) is essential for the first steps in meiosis, and aminopeptidase M1 (APM1) appears to be important in mitosis and cell division. \u2020 Conclusions M1 metalloprotease activity in the cell cycle is conserved across phyla. The activities of the multifunctional M1s, processing small peptides and peptide hormones and contributing to protein trafficking and signal transduction processes, either directly or indirectly impact on the cell cycle. Identification of peptide substrates and interacting protein partners is required to understand M1 function in fertility and normal growth and development in plants.",

This highly regulated process involves co-ordination of transcriptional through post-translational mechanisms. A post-translational mechanism that appears to regulate or modulate the cell cycle is the activity of a group of zinc metalloproteases in the M1 family of metalloenzymes. M1 metalloprotease functions include (a) small-peptide processing, often peptide hormones, (b) regulation of cell cycle progression (meiotic or mitotic exit), (c) protein trafficking and (d) signal transduction. Although this group of enzymes is present in all kingdoms, M1 function, i.e. enzymatic targets or interactions with other proteins, in the cell cycle is yet to be defined.",

M1 metalloprotease activity during plant growth and development have recently be observed, with meiotic prophase aminopeptidase (MPA1) important for female and male meiosis and aminopeptidase M1 (APM1) with a putative role in mitosis and cytokinesis. In plants loss-of-function results in decreased fertility from improperly formed gametes (mpa1) and embryo and seedling lethality from cell division arrest (apm1), and similar fertility and embryo lethal phenotypes have been observed in animals. Loss or impaired M1 function in mammals is also correlated with reduced fertility, type-II diabetes and cholesterol uptake. Therefore, these proteins play essential roles in meiosis and mitosis, as well as hormonal or nutrient homeostasis. This brief review will introduce the M1 metalloprotease family, the enzymatic mechanism and known functions, followed by specific examples of M1s in animals and plants and their roles in the cell cycle ( Table 1) .",

            "text": "The M1 family of zinc metalloproteases is distinguished from other M-type proteases by signature amino acid motifs comprising the catalytic region (Medina et al., 1991; Vazeux et al., 1998; Laustsen et al., 2001; Pham et al., 2007) . Substrates for this family vary widely, including acidic, basic and neutral amino acid residues. All members of the family process N-terminal amino acids, and cleave either a single amino acid or, less frequently, a series of amino acids. Substrate targets of the M1s tend to be small peptides. Evidence of endopeptidase activity has been shown for a bacterial member of the family, pepN, under stress conditions (Chandu and Nandi, 2003) . The M1 metalloproteases are also called gluzincins since they bind a single Zn ion for Zn/water hydrolysis of the substrate. In contrast to other Zn metalloenzymes where the Zn cofactor is co-ordinated by three histidines or by cysteines, the Zn-binding motif of M1 metalloproteases is HEXXH[18X]E, where the two histidines and a distal glutamic acid co-ordinate the Zn ion (Lausten et al., 2001) (Fig. 1A) . The proximal glutamic acid is required for water hydrolysis of peptide bonds and subsequent release of the substrate, as demonstrated from mutational analyses (Thompson et al., 2003) . The exopeptidase domain GXMXN is the other conserved amino acid motif (Iturrioz et al., 2001) . M1 enzymatic activities are regulated by calcium (Goto et al., 2007) , and M1 enzymes are characterized by varying degrees of sensitivity to the inhibitor puromycin, which arrests eukaryotic cells in the G 2 /M phase (Constam et al., 1995) .",

Further, some soluble M1s are secreted and, therefore, may be active both inside and outside of the cell ( Fig. 2A ). Many M1s function as homodimers, and others form heterodimers with other types of proteins (Hussain et al., 1981; Itoh et al., 1997; Bernier et al., 1998; Matsumoto et al., 2000; Mustafa et al., 2001) .

Homodimers may be formed via disulfide linkages or non-covalent interactions (Hesp and Hooper, 1997; Papadopoulos et al., 2001; Ofner and Hooper, 2002) . Both integral and peripheral M1s may have additional dileucine protein interaction motifs that function in recycling and retention of the proteins in endosomal populations (Rasmussen et al., 2000; Johnson et al., 2001; Katagiri et al., 2002; Cowburn et al., 2006) .

APA cleaves the small eight-amino acid hormone It may also interact with other proteins in the endosome or PM and modulate their functions, such as signal transduction or processing peptides that are exported to or imported from the extracellular space.

APN acts as membrane receptor for a 14-3-3s protein, stratifin, which results in p38 MAPK cascade to stimulate matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression in fibrobasts (Ghaffari et al., 2010) . Knockdown of APN resulted in decreased 14-3-3s binding at the cell surface and decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1, which is involved in tumour metastasis. Therefore, APN appears to have a role in cell migration or cell adhesion, also consistent with an enzymatic activity against type-IV collagen.",

In a genetic screen in Drosopilia, the APN loss-of-function allele slamdance was identified as suppressor of rougheyes in rap/fzr ( fizzy-related; Kaplow et al., 2007) . FZR is a component of the anaphase-promoting complex, which degrades cyclins during G 1 and G 2 . FZR loss-of function mutants have an extra cell division in the epidermis and endoreduplication is inhibited in salivary glands (Sigrist and Lehner, 1997) . Therefore, suppression of the fzr mutant phenotype by the loss of APN suggests that APN may play a role in cell cycle progression by regulating cyclin accumulations. In mammalian monocytes, APN cell surface localization is modulated by the cell cycle, with a decrease observed during S phase (Lohn et al., 2002) , and the authors hypothesize, based on inhibition of APN activity by antibodies, that APN acts as a ligand receptor or processes peptides that inhibit cell cycle rates. This is similar to what is seen with respect to proposed APA function in B cell proliferation.",

This highly regulated insulin-inducible trafficking of GLUT4 and IRAP to the plasma membrane is mediated by a protein -protein interaction motif in the N-terminus of IRAP with AS160, an Akt with phosphorylation and Rab GTPase activating activity (Peck et al., 2006) .

IRAP can also cleave AngIII to AngIV, which is a competitive inhibitor of IRAP catalytic activity (Lew et al., 2003; Albiston et al., 2004) . Therefore, the AngIV cleavage product, produced by APN or IRAP activity, appears to inhibit IRAP activity to rectify the effects of AngIII. Therefore both membrane-bound and soluble IRAP can decrease the effects of AngIII by attenuating the signal and degrading the secreted product. An additional role of IRAP at the plasma membrane may be to cleave cell proliferation inhibitors and promote angiogenesis in tumour cells. IRAP has been shown to increase cell proliferation in endometrial cancer cells (Shibata et al., 2007) .

The A-P axis is formed in the single-celled embryo by migration of the sperm-donated centrosomes to signal the posterior axis, which is aberrant in pam-1 mutants (Fortin et al., 2010) . When microtubules were inhibited in pam-1, the A-P axis was restored, and cell division proceeded (Fortin et al., 2010) .

APM1 is a peripheral membrane protein that was identified by its specificity for the noncompetitive auxin transport inhibitor N-1-naphthylphthalmic acid (NPA) and the ability to slowly hydrolyse the compound (Murphy and Taiz, 1999a, b; Murphy et al., 2000 Murphy et al., , 2002 Murphy et al., , 2005 Smith et al., 2003; Peer et al., 2009; Hosein et al., 2010) . The structure of NPA is similar to phthalamide which inhibits M1 activity in animals and plants (Komoda et al., 2001; Murphy et al., 2002; Kakuta et al., 2003) . At high concentrations, NPA inhibits APM1 activity, and exhibits increasing inhibition over time (Murphy and Taiz, 1999a; Murphy et al., 2002) . Although the mechanism of NPA inhibition of APM1 activity is not known, NPA binds in the active site of APM1, which cleaves the amide bond of NPA. However, the phthalic acid may not be released from the active site or NPA may also bind to an allosteric site in APM1, thereby resulting in an inactive enzyme. NPA binding appears to destabilize APM1, as neither dimers nor monomers are observed after NPA treatment (Hosein et al., 2010) .",

Site-directed mutagenesis studies have identified amino acid residues and regions of the protein that are essential for its function, as assayed by the ability of the overexpressed mutated construct to rescue the apm1 embryo lethal or root growth arrest phenotypes (Hosein et al., 2010) . A b-pleated region in the N-terminus appears to mediate membrane association, and a region of the C-terminus is also essential for APM1 activity. Although mutation of the zinc-binding domain did not rescue any phenotypes, mutation of the exopeptidase domain resulted in partial restoration of embryo lethality in apm1-1, suggesting that exopeptidase activity may be less important during embryo development (Hosein et al., 2010) . However, overexpression of a catalytically inactive APM1 in apm1-2, which accumulates a truncated protein missing the C-terminus, rescues the mutant. In addition, the same results are obtained when apm1 mutants are transformed with catalytically active or inactive IRAP, also indicating conservation of M1 function across kingdoms. These results also indicate that one intact copy of the catalytic domain and one intact copy of the C-terminus are required for APM1 function, and that the domains need not be in the same linear molecule (Hosein et al., 2010) . As mentioned above, the C-terminus of M1s often have protein interaction motifs. The C-terminus of APM1 may be important for its dimerization or interaction with other proteins. Candidate proteins with which APM1 may interact were identified via co-purification , and co-immunoprecipitation, yeast two-hybrid, yeast three-hybrid and split-ubiquitin assays. However, more experiments are needed to conclude which proteins interact with APM1 and which proteins are substrate targets.",

Root growth arrest can be attributed to (a) premature determinacy of the root meristem, as shown by cessation of quiescent centre activity, and (b) cell cycle arrest, as shown by absence of cyclinB1;1 expression (Peer et al., 2009) . Several factors maintain the quiescent centre including non-cell autonomous transcription factors (e.g. SHORTROOT, SCARECROW), mobile small peptide hormones (e.g. CLAVATA3/ESR-related CLE proteins), and the hormone auxin. SHR and SCR are misexpressed or mislocalized in apm1 lines, resulting in mis-specification of the ground tissue (Peer et al., 2009) . APM1 expression increases in the presence of auxin in a two-stage manner, suggesting both a primary auxin response and a secondary response which is usually associated with wounding or defence (Peer et al., 2009) , and the promoter contains an auxin-responsive element (TGTCAT; Donner et al., 2009) , consistent with increased expression following auxin application. A putative zinc carboxypeptidase SOL1 was identified in a CLE19 overexpression screen, suggesting that CLE may be activated by SOL1 activity (Casamitjana-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2003) . Although the substrate(s) for APM1 are yet to be identified, one of the CLE proteins is a possible candidate for activation/deactivation by APM1. The absence of cyclinB1;1 expression in the apm1-1 suggests that the mutants may be arrested in G 2 /M or never reached that stage (Peer et al., 2009) . The APM1 promoter contains signature sequences associated with cell cycle regulation (GCCCR; Banchio et al., 2003) , supporting that APM1 expression may be tied to the cell cycle. At least two other M1 metalloproteases have been implicated in meiotic or mitotic exit (PSA and PAM-1), while APN may regulate or act as a component of the anaphase-promoting complex. Therefore, it seems likely that APM1 may also play a role in cell cycle progression that is yet to be elucidated.",

Unlike APM1 and TAF2L2/LTA4HL (see below) which have one gene model each, MPA1 has four different gene models, suggesting the possibility of spatio-temperal regulation. Based on amino acid motif analysis, MPA1 appears to be a soluble protein that lacks the N-terminal hydrophobic and C-terminal protein -protein interaction domains present in APM1. The enzymatic activity of MPA1 has not been described; however, treatment of inflorescences with a fluorescent version of the M1 inhibitor PAQ22 phenocopied a meiotic defect observed in the loss-of-function mutant (S\u00e1nchez-Mor\u00e1n et al., 2004) . The semi-sterile phenotype was also attributed to inhibition of MPA1 activity (S\u00e1nchez-Mor\u00e1n et al., 2004) , but the observed embryo abortion was likely an aggregation of inhibition of MPA1 during gametogenesis and APM1 during embryogenesis.",

Proteomics of the arabidopsis extracellular space following Pseudomonas syringae infection indicates that abundance of MPA1 in the apoplast was increased by type-III effectors (TTEs) but decreased by microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) as well as gene-for-gene resistance (Kaffarnik et al., 2009) . Bacterial MAMPs, e.g. flagellin, induce the basal defence system in plants via a receptor-like kinase-mediated signal transduction cascade. Bacterial TTEs overcome the MAMP-activated resistance by affecting cellular responses, from mitogen-activated protein kinases (Zhang et al., 2007) to RNA metabolism (Fu et al., 2007) . The MAMP-associated decrease in apoplastic MPA1 may be either through bacterial degradation of MPA1 or suppression of MPA1 secretion (Kaffarnik et al., 2009) . The presence of MPA1 outside of the cell suggests that MPA1 may also have a role in basal defence responses or modification of extracellular peptides. Increased extracellular MPA1 accumulation by TTEs suggests that MPA1 activity provides metabolic products for the pathogen.",

MEROPS places it as cold-active aminopeptidase (Colwellia psychrerythraea)-type peptidase. Aminopeptidase activity has been reported for this protein (Walling, 2006) , but LTA4H/epoxide hydrolase activity has not been examined. In animals, leukotrienes are fatty acids that are lipid signalling molecules acting via G-coupled protein receptors (Haeggstr\u00f6m, 2000) , and plant compounds are used therapeutically to inhibit leukotriene synthesis/activity (Adams and Bauer, 2008) . Plants are not considered to synthesize leukotrienes (nor the arachidonic acid precursor), although there is one report of LTB4 and LTC4 accumulation in nettle glandular trichomes (Czarnetzki et al., 1990) . Epoxide hydrolases in plants are associated with conversion of fatty acids stores in seeds and synthesis of cutins for defence (Stark et al., 1995; Bl\u00e9e and Schuber, 1993) . Leukotrienes are synthesized by a complex of enzymes, with the soluble LTA4H having both cytosolic and nuclear localization (Newcomer and Gilbert, 2010) . A biological function for human LTA4H aminopeptidase activity has not been demonstrated. Overexpression (35S) constructs of At5g13520 show nuclear localization, as well as cytosolic localization (Hosein et al., 2010) . At5g13520 was expressed in the apm1-3 loss-of-function lines which showed heterodimerzation of the mutant APM1 protein and TAF2L2/LTA4HL, with the observed cytosolic localization attributed to the herterodimer (Hosein et al., 2010) . That being said, more research needs to be conducted with native promoters, and the subcellular localization suggests that this protein may be involved in (a) processing transcription factor-associated proteins or small peptide hormones in the nucleus and/or (b) fatty acid biosynthesis/ metabolism.",

M1 enzymatic function is required for cell cycle regulation in both meiosis and mitosis and for processing small peptides, such as hormones, for growth and antigens for defence. M1s can function as classical receptors and participants in signal transduction. They participate in cellular trafficking of transporters, directly or indirectly, and sterols. Some of M1 function in these processes is dependent on microtubule associations or degradation of microtubule-associated proteins. However, it is unclear if M1 function is independent of catalytic activity due to the small number of studies of enzymatically inactive proteins. These studies are difficult as loss-of-function is often lethal.",

An hypothesis of APM1 function was based on hormone-induced trafficking of a transporter to the plasma membrane, i.e. auxin-induced trafficking of APM1 and an auxin transporter to the plasma membrane as an analogue of insulin-induced trafficking of IRAP and GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. This model was based on co-purification of APM1 with auxin transporters and trafficking components (Muday and Murphy, 2002; Murphy et al., 2002; Muday et al., 2003) . Although this hypothesis has not been fully tested, it appears that APM1 effects on auxin transporter localization are indirect (Peer et al., 2009) .

            "text": "The role of APM1 in the switch between an indeterminate and determinate root meristem may lie in nutritional homeostasis, small-peptide processing or anaphase-promoting complex activity or a combination of the above. A potential role of APM1 in nutritional homeostasis may lie in N-terminal peptide processing, perhaps as part of the proteasome, to supply the free amino acid pools for de novo protein synthesis or nitrogen availability for growth. Small peptide hormones and signalling molecules, e.g. CLE, have been shown to regulate and maintain the meristem and occur as gradients in the root with some CLE proteins promoting meristem maintenance and others vascular differentiation via phospholipid signalling (Hirakawa et al., 2008; Whitford et al., 2008; Gagne and Clark, 2010; Meng et al., 2010) . Since overexpression or exogenous application of CLE results in root meristem consumption (Fiers et al., 2005; Ito et al., 2006) , APM1 may serve to attenuate the signal. APM1 activity could also attenuate tracheary element differentiation inhibitory factors which share sequence identity with CLEs (Ito et al., 2006) . This hypothesis is consistent with APM1 localization pattern, the apm1 mutant phenotypes and tissue-specific substrates observed for animal M1 metalloproteases. The APM1 promoter contains three GCCCR elements, indicating that its expression is regulated by the cell cycle, and it may regulate cell cycle checkpoints as does PSA. MPA1 activity in meiosis appears to be clear, although the substrate and mechanism of its action is not known, while the function of extracellular MPA1 is unknown. The function of TAF2L2/ LTA4HL is also unknown. Many outstanding questions remain, which can only begin to be answered when both peptide substrates and protein partners for M1 metalloproteases are identified.",

            "text": "Efforts to identify aminopeptidase substrates in plants have been unsatisfactory due to lack of technological advances required to identify products of single amino acid hydrolysis from peptides in planta. Proteomics approaches, such as twodimensional electrophoresis, cannot distinguish such small changes. In addition, the activity of the aminopeptidase may be followed by other hydrolytic events, thereby obscuring the aminopeptidase activity of interest. Protease inhibitors, such as MG132 which is specific for the proteosome, have been used to distinguish between proteosome-dependent and -independent activities. Combinations of protease inhibitors have also been used, but these are not always specific, and then definitive results cannot be obtained. For example, bestatin is a strong inhibitor of M24 metalloproteases and M1s to a lesser extent, therefore an inhibited M1 activity may be incorrectly attributed to M24. The sensitivity of M1s to inhibitors should be revisited which would better inform this approach. An approach that may be more fruitful is to change the enzyme into a substrate-binding protein without catalytic activity. This should lead to identification of physiologically relevant substrates from plant cell extracts. Understanding the function of APM1 and MPA1 in the cell cycle in plants has clear implications for understanding of M1 function in the cell cycle and development in other organisms.",
