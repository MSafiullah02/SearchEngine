            "text": "A rapid antiviral immune response may be related to viral interaction with the host cell leading to activation of macrophages via pattern recognition receptors (PPRs) or specific viral receptors. Carcinoembryonic cell adhesion antigen 1a (CEACAM1a) is the specific receptor for the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus known to induce acute viral hepatitis in mice. The objective of this study was to understand the mechanisms responsible for the secretion of high-pathogenic MHV3-induced inflammatory cytokines. We report that the induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a in peritoneal macrophages does not depend on CEACAM1a, as demonstrated in cells isolated from Ceacam1a )/) mice. The induction of IL-6 and TNF-a production was related rather to the fixation of the spike (S) protein of MHV3 on Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in regions enriched in heparan sulphate and did not rely on viral replication, as demonstrated with denatured S protein and UVinactivated virus. High levels of IL-6 and TNF-a were produced in livers from infected C57BL/6 mice but not in livers from Tlr2 )/) mice. The histopathological observations were correlated with the levels of those inflammatory cytokines. Depending on mouse strain, the viral fixation to heparan sulfate/TLR2 stimulated differently the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-jB in the induction of IL-6 and TNF-a. These results suggest that TLR2 and heparan sulphate receptors can act as new viral PPRs involved in inflammatory responses.",

            "text": "The ability of innate immune mechanisms to respond to viral infection plays a major role in the survival of the host. The first step of a viral infection is the fixation of virus to its specific receptor, exposed on target cells. However, many viruses can use, as specific receptors, surface molecules located on macrophages or lymphocytes that are involved in innate defence mechanisms, thus modifying the antiviral functions of these cells. [1] [2] [3] The rapid antiviral immune response may be related to viral interactions with host cells, leading to activation of susceptible cells via pattern recognition receptors (PPRs). 4 Although many PPRs have been identified for bacteria, few PPRs are known for viruses on macrophages. Tolllike receptors (TLRs) and the helicases retinoid-inducible gene (RIG), melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA5) and RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) are known to be engaged following some viral infections and to initiate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and interferon a/b. 5 The occurrence of a new respiratory disease, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in which over-exuberant pulmonary inflammation is induced, has raised the possibility that some viral components may stimulate the production of inflammatory cytokines by macrophages. Wang et al. demonstrated that a surface viral protein from the SARS virus directly stimulated the production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)-6. 6, 7 The induction of macrophage inflammatory cytokines by viral surface proteins has been occasionally observed with other viruses, such as feline infectious peritonitis virus and Epstein-Barr virus. 8, 9 The mechanisms triggered by coronaviruses in the induction of the inflammatory response by macrophages are not known. Mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3), a coronavirus, induces a rapid acute hepatitis characterized by the death of susceptible C57BL/6 mice within 3-5 days post-infection. [10] [11] [12] Histopathological studies revealed an extensive necrosis with inflammatory perivascular foci and impairment of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-b. 13, 14 Carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecules 1 (CEACAM1), previously known as biliary glycoproteins, are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. 15 Murine CEACAM1 proteins are mostly present in the liver and intestine and have been reported to act as receptors for different bacterial and viral pathogens, including MHV. 16, 17 These observations were supported by the fact that C57BL/6 mice knocked out for the Ceacam1a gene are completely resistant to MHV-A59 infection. 18 CEACAM1a promotes various functions, such as cellular adhesion, signalling, tumour suppression and angiogenesis. 15 Activation of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) induces the secretion of IL-1a, IL-6 and TNF-a by Kupffer cells and then promotes the establishment of hepatic metastasis. 19 Furthermore, it was demonstrated that production of IL-1a and TNF-a by Kupffer cells, via the activation of CEA, involved tyrosine phosphorylation. 20 In addition, the signalling pathway implicated in CEA-activated cells seemed to be different from the pathway involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated Kupffer cells. 20 It was reported that stimulation of CEACAM1a on PC12 cells by antibodies induced a rapid and transient CEACAM1a tyrosine dephosphorylation, which was involved in the downstream activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1 and ERK-2 but not Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). 21 In contrast, the replication of MHV3 in peritoneal macrophages involved the activation of the p38 and the ERK-1/2 MAPK in less than 30 min, suggesting that cellular activation was a result of the fixation of the virus to its receptor. 22 However, de Haan et al. demonstrated that some murine coronavirus variants generated by in vitro cultures expressed an extended host range and also used heparan sulphate binding sites as an entry receptor instead of using the specific CEACAM1a receptor. 23 Recently, Watanabe et al. have observed that another serotype, the MHV-JHM virus, can interact with heparan sulphate, but this receptor cannot allow the internalization of this virus. 24 It has been demonstrated that a few viral proteins, such as the capsid of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), the core of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), or herpes simplex virus (HSV) glycoproteins, may induce pro-inflammatory cytokines via the activation of TLR2 associated or not with membranes enriched in heparan sulphate. [25] [26] [27] [28] The recognition by TLRs of pathogen-associated molecule patterns (PAMPs) triggers the toll/interleukin-1 receptor-like (TIR)domain-dependent association with adapters (such as myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapter protein (TIRAP)) that recruit IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) and, following their phosphorylation, activates other factors involved in the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-jB, resulting in the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a. 29 Moreover, during chronic HCV infections, the serum IL-6 levels correlate with the viral load and the length of the infection, 30 whereas TNF-a levels increase hepatic cellular apoptosis. 31, 32 The in vivo relevance of this observation may be related to the expression of TLRs in liver injury and the inflammatory state of chronically HCV-infected patients, 33 but the mechanisms involved have not yet been elucidated.",

Furthermore, addition of an inhibitor to SHP-1, implicated in the CEACAM1a signalling pathway, 43 did not impair cytokine production by C57BL/6 macrophages. These results demonstrated that CEACAM1a is not involved in the induction of the production of inflammatory cytokines by MHV3-infected macrophages. However, this conclusion does not totally exclude the possibility that cytokine production may be associated with intracellular pathways related to CEA-CAM1a, as demonstrated by a slight increase of IL-6 and TNF-a in macrophages from C57BL/6 mice treated with the SHP-1 inhibitor. The production of IL-6 and TNF-a in SJL-derived macrophages also indicates that CEA-CAM1b is not also involved. However, it has been reported that incubation of dendritic cells with a specific CEACAM1a mAb (AgB10) promotes the release of various chemokines and cytokines, such as macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1a, MIP-2, IL-6 and IL-12, and increases the expression of the costimulatory molecules CD40, CD54, CD80 and CD86 on these cells. 42 CEACAM1a pro-inflammatory properties may be differently regulated in different cell types.",

This observation suggests that MHV3 may use heparan sulphate or a closely related receptor to induce the production of cytokines by macrophages, rather than the CEACAM1a receptor. In fact, the production of IL-6 and TNF-a by MHV3-infected peritoneal macrophages is induced by viral fixation to a receptor located in regions enriched in heparan sulphate but not by viral replication, as demonstrated by experiments using viruses with denaturated S protein or UV-inactivated viruses. Thus, denaturation of viral S protein by incubation at pH 8\u00c10 and 37\u00b0inhibited the production of IL-6 and TNF-a, whereas UV inactivation of MHV3, which does not alter viral fixation to the cell surface but inhibits efficient viral replication (confirmed by MHV3 immunolabelling), did not impair the production of IL-6 and TNF-a in C57BL/6 or Ceacam1a )/) peritoneal macrophages.

The respective roles of the p38 MAPK, ERK MAPK and JNK pathways in MHV viral replication have not yet been determined. However, the p38 MAPK and JNK pathways, but not the ERK-1/2 pathway, were activated in MHV-A59-infected J774.1 cells. In addition, UV-irradiated MHV-A59 did not activate the MAPKs. 47 Nevertheless, the downstream activation of CEACAM1 seems to involve the ERK-1/2 pathway in particular, whereas expression of the CEACAM1 signalling pathway may be regulated through the NF-jB pathway. 21, 48, 49 However, we have demonstrated that viral fixation to the CEACAM1a receptor is not directly involved in the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-a by MHV3-infected peritoneal macrophages as these cytokines were also induced in cells from Ceacam1a )/) mice and regulated by the MAPK pathways.

Indeed, inhibition of the NF-jB pathway partially inhibits IL-6 and TNF-a production by macrophages isolated from Ceacam1a )/) mice. Furthermore, the p38 and ERK-1/2 MAPK pathways can be induced by peptidoglycan/ TLR2 activation in different cell types such as Kupffer cells and eosinophils. 51, 52 Nevertheless, no information is available on the regulation of CEACAM-mediated intracellular signalling activation by TLRs.

The PPR role of the TLRs and the heparan sulphate receptor in the presence of infectious viruses demonstrated a new viral mechanism for amplification of the inflammatory response, thus explaining the severity of diseases induced by human or mouse coronaviruses. Cytokine regulation in coronavirus infections has been poorly explored. Our results indicate that MHV3 is a powerful model for such studies. We have demonstrated that the murine coronavirus MHV3 can stimulate the production of IL-6 and TNF-a by activating TLR2/heparan sulphate regions at the cell surface of macrophages.
