Moreover, in case a patient can still partly breathe on his/her own, a ventilator should synchronize the controlled pressure profile with the inspiratory and expiratory efforts of the patient, for the comfort and safety of the patient. In other words, if a patient tries to inhale, the ventilator should recognize this (a so-called trigger) and support this effort by increasing the pressure. In case a patient tries to exhale, a ventilator should support this effort by decreasing the pressure (such that the patients lungs can passively exhale). This so-called patient-ventilator synchrony is important for the comfort of the patient, as it is clear from several studies in the literature [1], [4], [8], [16], [18], [22], [24]. Asynchrony can lead to prolonged stay in the hospital and even associates with higher mortality [4].",

On the other hand, a low-gain pressure controller is preferred in terms of keeping the amount of unwanted oscillations (see Fig. 1) in the patient flow signal small, because this can result in false triggers, which may lead to unwanted induction of an inhalation cycle. Therefore, there is a tradeoff between applying a high-gain controller for accurate pressure tracking and a low-gain controller for obtaining a stable flow response avoiding false inhalation triggers. In order to balance this tradeoff in a more desirable manner, we propose to use a variable-gain control strategy in this paper.",

            "text": "Current mechanical ventilators in hospitals are often highly flexible and versatile machines with many possible ventilation modes [6], [13]. Many ventilation modes synchronize the machine support with the patient effort for the comfort and safety of the patient. Although computer-controlled ventilation is common, a few research studies have been done on the actual controller design, or companies are unwilling to share their knowledge about this subject and, therefore, publications in this area are unfortunately scarce. Some control-related research has been performed in the area of mechanical ventilation focusing on iterative learning control (ILC) [19], funnel-based control [17], or general control applications in ventilation [5], [6], [25]. However, from the experience of the authors, common practice in the existing ventilator systems is that the linear PID-type feedback controllers are used in order to reach the target pressures accurately. Note that the application of accurate feedforward is difficult in mechanical ventilators due to the fact that the patient (lung) dynamics is uncertain, the properties of the hose and bacterial filters attached are typically unknown, and the breathing efforts of the patients are unpredictable. Therefore, the robust PID-type controllers are practically used for a large range of different patient-lung characteristics, which balance between the conflicting tradeoffs of high-gain versus low-gain control. The ILC might be seem as a suitable solution for a repetitive process of mechanical ventilation; however, with the patients triggering breaths, this inherently becomes a nonrepetitive process. Moreover, the \u201cplant\u201d used in the ILC controller incorporates the human patient, which makes it an even more challenging strategy to apply in practice.",

By using a variable-gain controller, the high-gain controller can only be applied when needed (during pressure buildup and release) and a low-gain controller can be applied when a stable flow response is needed (when the patient flow is small), such that the tradeoff can possibly be balanced in a more desirable manner. The variable-gain control strategy has been used extensively in the area of motion control [3], [11], [12], [15], [23]. In these works, the variable-gain control approach is also used to balance between the conflicting control objectives, i.e., low-gain disturbance suppression versus sensitivity to high-frequency noise (i.e., the waterbed effect [20]) or overshoot versus removing steady-state errors. However, the variable-gain control in the mechanical ventilation is novel and targets the essentially different performance tradeoffs.",

Second, the experimental results confirm that indeed a variable-gain controller, which switches gains on the basis of the magnitude of the patient-flow, can outperform its linear counterparts. As a benefit for the patient, trigger levels can be set to a small level, to allow for best possible machine-patient synchronization for the comfort of the patient, while still achieving sufficiently fast pressure buildup that guarantees good breathing support.",
