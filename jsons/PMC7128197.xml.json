Healthcare leadership will need to balance the cost and benefit of investing in such programs. Developing a RPP for enhanced preparedness to new infectious and unexpected respiratory outbreaks and pandemics requires that the infection control programs redefine their roles under three main pillars: policy and procedure, facility preparedness and accountability and leadership, Table 1\n. A RPP would be essential to address, at a minimum, the availability of proper isolation facility, equipment and supplies, including soap and water, alcohol based hand gel, masks and respirators. The latter requires proper fitting of all at-risk healthcare providers. Further considerations would include the availability of alternatives for respirators, such as the Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs), which require proper cleaning and storage, as well as training on their usage. Assessing the capacity for airborne isolation is a major intervention, but a necessary one. Some healthcare facilities will have to build new facilities or renovate old ones to fulfill airborne isolation requirements [14].",

Among the top infectious scenarios are: the emergence of a novel respiratory pathogen; a viral hemorrhagic pathogen, such as Ebola (EHV); or an agent with the potential to be used in a bioterrorism attack, such as anthrax or smallpox. The infectious disease disaster plan (IDDP) will have unique elements that depend on the characteristics of the pathogen, its transmission and the presence of effective mitigation strategies. Hence, an IDDP would need to be accompanied by special drills to ensure the full preparedness of the facility and staff. Such drills would lead to clarification of individual roles, the refinement of incident command structure and the development of needed training materials and policies. Such a plan would also need to be integrated and practiced at many levels of the healthcare system. At a minimum, it could be practiced as a tabletop exercise, but more effectively, it should be practiced at the hospital level, at the health system level, and at the city, regional and national levels, if possible. In essence, an IDDP needs to be adopted at the national level to ensure support and sharing of human and non-human resources [15].",

Many examples exist from the SARS outbreaks in a number of cities, from the MERS outbreaks and, most recently, from Ebola outbreaks. Over the past decade alone, we have witnessed the emergence of at least two novel influenza strains, two corona viruses and the unprecedented spread of a known viral hemorrhagic virus, Ebola. Despite the available resources in some countries, the Achilles heel of most healthcare systems remains their inability to predict and detect such threats, then to respond and manage them. The development of preparedness plans that are integrated into health-care systems, regardless of how simple these healthcare systems may be in many low income source countries, will be the first step to enable nations to address the next respiratory threat. In addition, support to implement the International Health Regulation (IHR) guidelines are desperately needed if countries are expected to recognize and contain emerging pathogens. This would be necessary to prevent these pathogens from becoming global threats.",
