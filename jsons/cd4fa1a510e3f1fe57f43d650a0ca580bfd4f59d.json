            "text": "An outbreak of novel coronavirus-related pneumonia COVID-19, that was identified in December 2019, has expanded rapidly, with cases now confirmed in more than 211 countries or areas. This constant transmission of a novel coronavirus and its ability to spread from human to human have prompted scientists to develop new approaches for treatment of COVID-19. A recent study has shown that remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the replication and infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCov) in vitro. In the United States, one case of COVID-19 was successfully treated with compassionate use of remdesivir in January of 2020. In addition, a clinically proven protease inhibitor, camostat mesylate, has been demonstrated to inhibit Calu-3 infection with SARS-CoV-2 and prevent SARS-2-spike protein (S protein)-mediated entry into primary human lung cells. Here, we systemically discuss the pharmacological therapeutics targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), proteinase and S protein for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review should shed light on the fundamental rationale behind inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 enzymes RdRp as new therapeutic approaches for management of patients with COVID-19. In addition, we will discuss the viability and challenges in targeting RdRp and proteinase, and application of natural product quinoline and its analog chloroquine for treatment of coronavirus infection. Finally, determining the structural-functional relationships of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 will provide new insights into inhibition of interactions between S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and enable us to develop novel therapeutic approaches for novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.",

This spike protein (S protein) is responsible for interacting with the host cells, such as the pulmonary and parabronchial epithelial cell, and helps the coronavirus get through the epithelial cell membrane [26] . In addition, the alveolar epithelial cells have abundant expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is targeted by the virus. The recognition of ACE2 by the S protein of the virus enables the invasion of the coronavirus into the human circulation system [27] . Recent study demonstrates that ACE2 is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, which is required for cell entry [28] . Single-strand RNA (ssRNA) viruses such as the coronavirus family replicate the virus genomes by taking advantage of host cells. For example, after coronavirus approaches the ribosome of the epithelial cells or other host cells, it uses the ribosome of the host cell to replicate polyproteins. The replication and subsequent processes of precursor polyproteins can occur in the epithelial cells [29] . After the coronavirus' polyproteins are expressed, two enzymes -specifically, coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro) -are thought to be involved in cleaving the polyproteins into smaller products used for replicating new viruses [30] . In order to generate the daughter RNA genome, the coronavirus expresses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is a crucial replicase that catalyzes the synthesis of a complementary RNA strand using the virus RNA template as shown in Figure 1 [31] .

RNA chaperones are usually nonspecific nucleic acid binding proteins, which have long disordered structures that promote RNA molecules to adjust conformational changes. For example, coronavirus nucleoproteins (N protein) have RNA chaperone activity and function as an RNA chaperone, which could help template switching [32] [33] [34] . In addition, recent studies demonstrate that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) phosphorylates the N protein of SARS-CoV and further inhibition of GSK3 can effectively inhibit viral replication in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV [35] . Furthermore, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is involved in the pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus and translation regulation in the host cells. Importantly, it has been shown that the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV had binding ability to human hnRNP A1 with high affinity by using kinetic analyses with a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) approach. These studies suggest that hnRNPA1 is able to bind to SARS-CoV N protein to form a replication/transcription complex and control viral RNA synthesis [36] .",

Homotypic interaction of M protein serves as the scaffold for the virus assembly and morphogenesis in the infected cells, specifically, both the interaction between the membrane (M) and S protein and the interaction between M and N protein promote the recruitment of structural components to the assembly location of host cells [37, 38] . For example, both envelope (E) protein and N proteins are required to be co-expressed with M protein for the formation and release of virus-like particles (VLPs) after transfection of Vero E6 cells. Two crucial structural proteins, the M protein and E protein, play important roles in the coronavirus assembly. In addition, the E protein is involved in particle assembly by binding with M and further inducing membrane curvature [39] . Subsequently, coronavirus particles can be budded into the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) of host cells, then trafficked in a smooth-wall vesicle and transported through the secretory pathway for assembly and release by exocytosis [40, 41] .",

The S protein plays important roles in the induction of neutralizing-antibody and leads to T cell responses, so it is involved in protective immunity during infection with SARS-CoV [42] . Vaccines can be developed to specifically recognize the spike protein for SARS and ACE2 receptor [42] . However, mutations of the virus gene and the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect might affect the efficacy of previously developed biological vaccines, or even spur a counterproductive immune response, although spike protein sequences in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS exhibit some overlap [43] [44] [45] . Although it is of importance to develop vaccines and biological therapeutics to prevent the expansion of the SARS-CoV-2, a careful evaluation of possible immune complications is required before applying the vaccine to the public. Therefore, it may take several months or a few years to generate effective vaccines to prevent outbreak. Recent study demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 has very similar genome sequence identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and there is more than 90% sequence similarity in several essential enzymes, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, papain-like proteinase (PLpro), 3CL-protease (3CL-pro) and spike glycoproteins [31] . Dissecting the structure of RdRp may provide new insights into the mechanisms of RNA replication as shown in Figure 2 [23] . Several drug candidates including ribavirin, lopinavir-ritonavir, and favipiravir, have been used previously to treat SARS or MERS, and these compounds may have potential in treating patients with SARS-CoV-2 from this current outbreak [31] . .

The structures demonstrate the interaction between the nucleotide substrates shown in pink and the conserved residues during the RdRp initiation, and the coordinated conformational changes preceding the elongation stage during replication.",

            "text": "Currently, there is no effective drug for treating COVID-19 although there was one case reported as having been treated successfully with compassionate use of remdsivir in the US. Recent studies have found that small molecules of remdesivir and chloroquine effectively suppress the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [24] . According to comparison of genome sequences of SARS-Cov-2 with SARS sequence, the catalytic domains of enzymes such as RdRp are highly conserved in these coronaviruses as shown in Figures 3 and 4 . More importantly, it is predictable that the protein sequence of the drug binding pocket of the enzymes is highly conserved [56] . Therefore, these enzymes and spike protein could be very promising drug targets for developing a therapeutic approach for COVID-19 as shown in Table 1 [57, 58] . RdRp, also known as nsp12, which catalyzes the synthesis of coronavirus RNA, is an essential enzyme of the coronaviral replication/transcription machinery complex. Recent study revealed the structure of SARS-CoV-2 full-length nsp12 in complex with cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 using cryo-EM [59] . Remdesivir (GS-5734, Gilead) was initially developed to examine its effect on inhibition of Ebola virus (EBOV) replication [60] . RdRp can incorporate remdesivir, which resembles an RNA building block ATP, into new RNA strands. After binding of remdesivir, RdRp stops being able to incorporate RNA subunits. This puts a stop to the coronavirus genome replication. Enzyme kinetics demonstrated that EBOV RdRp incorporated ATP and remdesivir-TP with comparable efficiencies. The selectivity of ATP for EBOV RdRp is four times against remdesivir-TP. In comparison, purified human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (h-mtRNAP) effectively distinguished against remdesivir-TP with a selectivity value of about 500-fold [60] .",

This also suggests the possibility that remdesivir has efficacy for related coronaviruses such as the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 [62] . More importantly, administration to patients with COVID-19 of remdesivir has been shown to be effective in treating one patient for the purpose of compassionate use in the US, and there was no adverse event observed in association with infusion of remdesivir.",

            "text": "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and global health concern, it is urgent to develop effective broad-spectrum virus replication inhibitors to manage patients with COVID-19. Drug targets among coronaviruses include the main protease 3CL(pro) and papain-like protease(PLpro). These proteinase play essential roles in processing polyproteins and viral replication. The structures of the unliganded SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and its complex with an alpha-ketoamide inhibitor have been recently revealed [52] . Comparison of genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS sequence indicates that the catalytic domains of proteinase are highly conserved in these coronaviruses. Therefore, it is plausible to repurpose the compound library for treatment of SARS-CoV for developing potential therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2. Computational analysis was also used to screen the effective and potent cysteine protease inhibitors for malaria and SARS infection [63] [64] [65] . Recently, a series of N-(tert-Butyl)-2-(N-arylamido)-2-(pyridin-3-yl) acetamides (ML188) were identified as potent noncovalent small molecule inhibitors targeting SARS-CoV 3CL protease [66, 67] . In addition, the analogues of keto-glutamine were developed as potent inhibitors for treatment of SARS infection [68, 69] . Furthermore, recent study has shown that compounds containing electrophilic arylketone moiety were designed and synthesized as new SARS-Cov 3CL protease inhibitors [70] . The anilide derived from 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline, l-phenylalanine and 4-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid was found to be a competitive inhibitor of the SARS-CoV 3CL protease with K(i) = 0.03 uM by using a fluorogenic tetradecapeptide substrate [70, 71] . It is demonstrated that trioxa-adamantane-triols (TATs) (BN, IBNCA, VANBA, euBN), trivially termed bananins, were identified to be effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV NSP10/nsp13 RNA/DNA helicase/NTPase protein ATPase enzymatic function. Bananin (BN) effectively suppresses both SARS-CoV RNA/DNA helicase nucleic acid unwinding function and SARS-CoV RNA-viral replication in cell culture [72] . In addition, high-throughput screening (HTS) approaches were used to screen potent inhibitors of the SARS-CoV main proteinase [73, 74] . Recent computational studies found that lopinavir, oseltamivir and ritonavir are able to bind with SARS-CoV-2 protease [75] . Potential therapeutic options targeting the main protease 3CLpro were identified for SARS-CoV-2, including covalent drugs (approved or clinically tested). There were at least six hits among the total of 11 potential hits identified by using the SCAR protocol [76] . Therefore, it will be intriguing to determine whether these compounds might be effective for inhibiting the activity of proteinase of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and reducing the replication of the virus in treating novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Recent study discovered that NHC effectively inhibited MERS-CoV and newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 replication using antiviral assays in the human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3 2B4 (\"Calu3\" cells) [78] . NHC has shown potent antiviral activity with an average half-maximum effective concentration (IC50) of 0.15 \u00b5M for cells with a recombinant MERS-CoV expressing nanoluciferase (MERS-nLUC), and there is no observed cytotoxicity. In addition, NHC was potently antiviral with an IC50 of 0.3 \u00b5M and CC50 of >10 \u00b5M when using a clinically isolated strain of SARS-CoV2 infected African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells [78] . Furthermore, NHC is highly effective for preventing the virus replication of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV as well as SARS-CoV infection in primary human airway epithelial cell cultures [78] . More importantly, NHC inhibited the replication of remdesivir (RDV)-resistant virus and multiple distinct zoonotic CoV [77] . EIDD-2801, an orally bioavailable prodrug of NHC (\u03b2-D-N4-hydroxycytidine-5 -isopropyl ester) designed for improved in vivo pharmacokinetics, remarkably reduced SARS-CoV replication and pathogenesis, significantly decreased MERS-CoV infectious titers, and reduced viral RNA and pathogenesis under both prophylactic and early therapeutic conditions in mice [78] . These studies indicate that EIDD-2801 could not only provide effective treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also enable the prevention of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and control future outbreaks of other emerging coronaviruses. It is worth noting that animal experiments and human clinical trials are needed to examine its efficacy for treatment of COVID-19.",

In addition, 36 alkaloids, alcohol extracts and chloroquine are effective in blocking the polymerization process in parasites. One of the main derivatives of quinine, mefloquine, was discovered to suppress the uptake of chloroquine in infected cells by blocking ingestion of hemoglobin to prevent parasite infection [82, 83] . Previous study demonstrated that chloroquine inhibited the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in vitro [84] .

            "text": "Recent study revealed that the protein sequence of the drug binding pocket of the enzymes is highly homogeneous between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [86] . Much progress has been made in the application of natural products and the development of novel therapy for SARS infection [87] [88] [89] [90] , for example, a new type of effective inhibitor was identified for inhibition of SARS-CoV proteinase by using substrate specificity profiling [72, 91, 92] . In addition to chloroquine, an anti-malaria natural product artemisinin has anti-viral activity although the mechanism of artemisinin to in inhibiting virus infection is unknown [93] [94] [95] . Natural products Tordylium persicum Boiss & Hausskn extract have also been identified for treatment of HIV [96] . Consistent with this, Cuscuta campestris crude extracts have been demonstrated to be effective for inhibition of HIV replication [97] . Cell-based screening assay has been developed to screen virus-specific and broad-spectrum inhibitors for treatment of coronavirus infection [98] [99] [100] . Therefore, it is necessary to examine the efficacy of artemisinin and other natural products on COVID-19 replication and infection. Another study has shown that the administration of hydroxychloroquine reduced the morbidity of COVID-19 pneumonia [101] [102] [103] . Chloroquine in clinical trials with a large number of patients will be further examined for treatment of COVID-19 [104] . Some traditional Chinese medicines such as Polygonum cuspidatum that may consist of components with efficacy against COVID-19 have been examined in clinical trials [105] . The pro-inflammatory metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) such as leukotrienes and thromboxanes promote inflammation, whereas lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins derived from AA, EPA and DHA facilitate wound healing, promote phagocytosis of macrophages and other immunocytes and decrease microbial load [106] . It is implicated that these unsaturated fatty acids and pro-inflammatory metabolites may serve as endogenous anti-viral compounds. It is intriguing to determine the efficacy of the metabolites on prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection [107] . In addition, using structure-based drug selection for identification of SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors, old drugs such as macrolides were predicted to be effective against COVID-19 [108] . Therefore, treatments with macrolides alone or in combination with other drugs may be promising and provide the possibility of a new strategy to fight this emerging SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

More studies are focused on investigating the mechanism of coronavirus invasion into host cells. Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is armed with a large \"spike protein\", which is used to interact with host cells and then gain entry through the cell membrane [109, 110] . Recent study has discovered the structure of MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein in complex with sialoside attachment receptors (PDB: 4KR0) [111] . MERS-CoV Spike glycoprotein is composed of an N-terminal S1 subunit, which is assembled as four domains (A-D) and controls attachment to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4, the host receptor), and a C-terminal S2 subunit that combines the viral and cellular membranes to initiate infection, as shown in Figure 5 [111] .",

The viral spike glycoprotein utilizes ACE2 as a host protein receptor and mediates merging of the viral and host membranes. This allows viral entry into host epithelial cells and host species tropism [112] . Given that the structure of S protein (PDB ID:6VSB) of SARS-CoV-2 is revealed [30, 86] , more computational analysis and virtual screening could be performed to identify the potential inhibitors of S protein and ACE2 interaction as shown in Figure 6 . In addition, recent study has shown that S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) is necessary for lysine-48-linked poly-ubiquitination of beclin 1, leading to its proteasomal degradation. Suppression of SKP2 promotes autophagy and decreases MERS coronavirus replication [113] . Recent study demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for invasion and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for S protein priming [28] . A clinically proven protease inhibitor, camostat mesylate, has been demonstrated to inhibit Calu-3 infection with SARS-CoV-2 and prevent SARS-2-Spike protein (S protein)-mediated entry into primary human lung cells [28] . In addition, recent study demonstrated that a neutralizing antibody CR3022 targets a highly conserved epitope, distal from the receptor-binding site, that enables cross-reactive binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. The structure of CR3022 in complex with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein has been revealed. The modeling study further proved that the binding epitope can only be targeted by CR3022 when the conformational changes with two RBD on the trimeric S protein are in the \"up\" orientation. This provides a molecular mechanism in the binding of the antibody with S protein of SARS-CoV-2 [114] . In line with this result, recent study demonstrates a highly potent pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting its spike protein that harbors a high capacity to mediate membrane fusion, and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection [115] . The molecular mechanisms of coronavirus invasion into host cells will provide new insights into the development of therapeutic approaches for COVID-19 by targeting spike proteins and ACE2 [116] [117] [118] .",

Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is armed with a large \"spike protein\", which is used to interact with host cells and then gain entry through the cell membrane [109, 110] . Recent study has discovered the structure of MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein in complex with sialoside attachment receptors (PDB: 4KR0) [111] .

This will decrease risk of disease dissemination, ameliorate disease progression, and bring down the need for intensive supportive care. Furthermore, treatments for moderate cases to decrease the time span of illness and infectivity may also be of significance for preventing COVID19 from becoming more wide-spread. Recent study demonstrated that there was no observed benefit with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 [119] . Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of treatment benefit. We mainly compare two ongoing clinical trials with remdesivir for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The first one targets mild/moderate patients, the second severe cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 infection, the widely investigated small molecule compound remdesvir could be a potential antiviral agent, based on pre-clinical studies in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. Remdesivir is a 1 -cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analogue prodrug that can be metabolized into its active form to exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity against coronavirus as shown in Figure 7 . A phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was designed to examine the efficacy of remdsivir in adult patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 respiratory disease. The inclusion criteria include: (1) laboratory RT-PCR confirmed patients infected with SARS-CoV-2; (2) lung involvement confirmed with CT imaging. The exclusion criteria include: patients with SaO2/SPO2\u226494% in room air condition; severe liver disease and severe renal impairment; and patients with any experimental treatment for COVID-19 (off-label, compassionate use, or trial related). 308 participants have been recruited and the clinical trial outcome will be released at the end of April 2020.

In adults presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from COVID-19, invasive mechanical ventilation, a conservative fluid strategy over a liberal fluid strategy, and intermittent boluses of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) to facilitate protective lung ventilation are necessary for supporting treatment [120] . For severe ARDS cases, the routine use of inhaled nitric oxide is recommended [120] . A randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigation of antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 has also initiated at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) in Omaha.

Induction of critical signaling proteins is crucial for the pathogenesis of CoV and is also involved in the activation of the innate immune response during CoV infection. Neutrophils are the first immune cells recruited to sites of viral infection. Recent studies demonstrate that excessive recruitment of neutrophils and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps results in acute lung injury of influenza pneumonitis [127] . In addition, neutrophil-derived myeloperoxidase (MPO) serves as a potent tissue damage factor and also contributes to influenza pneumonia in mice infected with influenza virus [128] [129] [130] [131] . In addition, coronavirus infection is able to induce stress response, autophagy, apoptosis, and activate innate immunity [40] . Host cell apoptosis caused by CoV infection has been extensively studied, for example, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infect and induce apoptosis in a variety of tissues including lung, spleen, thyroid tissues, and a variety of cell types, such as respiratory epithelial cells, neuronal cells, primary T lymphocytes, and dendritic cells [132, 133] . In addition, overexpression of SARS-CoV S was shown to induce a potent ER stress response, and the re-arrangement of DMV production and membrane alteration for the assembly of the virus may contribute to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress during CoV infection [40] . Unfolded protein response (UPR) -mediated signaling pathway was induced to maintain ER homeostasis [134, 135] . The IRE1 branch of UPR promotes cell survival during CoV infection and CoV infection activates JNK to modulate apoptosis induction [136, 137] . Induction of cell apoptosis provided the possible explanations for the fact that lymphopenia was observed in some patients with CoV infection, such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Immune cell apoptosis may lead to the suppression of host immune response and promote the occurring of ARDS.",

In macrophages, ORF8b provides a potent signal 2 required for activation of inflammasome and activates the NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR-and pyrin domain-containing protein 3) to form the inflammasome complex. Specifically, ORF8b is able to interact directly with the Leucine Rich Repeat (LRR) domain of NLRP3 and bind with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) in cytosolic dot-like structures [140] . ORF8b induces cell apoptosis and pyroptotic cell death in macrophages, while in those cells lacking NLRP3, accumulating ORF8b cytosolic substances lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, activation of inflammasome and caspase-independent cell death [140, 141] . Recent genome-wide and transcriptome-wide complementary network analysis of SARS-CoV-2/human interaction provided a new network of host proteins affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection [141] . It has been shown that ACE2 is downregulated in the presence of viral infection, therefore application of recombinant ACE2 has been shown to be effective in treating severe pulmonary infections and acute respiratory distress syndrome [142] . Recent studies demonstrate that soluble forms of ACE2 are beneficial to SARS patients, due to its competitive binders of SARS-CoV Spike proteins, preventing binding to the host cell ACE2 [143] .",

            "text": "Recent study indicate that there is a substantial number of undocumented infections and this facilitates the rapid dissemination of SARS-CoV2 [144] . These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of SARS-CoV2 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging. It is also informative to help understand the potential for infection by non-symptomatic subjects. Therefore, one of the most important strategies of management of COVID-19 infection is to effectively reduce the possibility of constant human-to-human viral transmission [145] . Keeping social distancing, contact tracing and quarantine are necessary for preventing substantial human to human transmission of COVID-19 [146] [147] [148] . Recent study demonstrated that the affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with ACE2 was 10-to 20-fold higher than the SARS-CoV S protein as shown in Figure 5 [30] , which explains the observations of rapid transmission from human-to-human in COVID-19 infection. Genetic analyses of hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed that there were two major types, L type and S type [149] . It seems that the L type (\u223c70%) was more dominant than the S type (\u223c30%). The L type was more common in the early stages of the outbreak in China. Artificial intervention may have put selective pressure on the L type, which might be more susceptible to mutate and spread more widely [149] . It is very challenging to makes an effective vaccine because of the rapid mutation of ssRNA and the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect [149] . Therefore, it is urgent to develop effective medicine for treatment of moderate and severe patients with low SpO2. Remdsivir may be potentially developed for treatment of COVID-19 after completing the phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to examine its efficacy in patients with COVID-19. In addition, better understanding of the mechanisms of coronavirus invasion into host cells could accelerate discovery of new inhibitors of interaction of spike glycoproteins and ACE2 and promote the development of therapeutic approaches for COVID-19. Finally, by drawing lessons from mechanisms of replication of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, development of potent and effective RdRp inhibitors will provide new insights required for putting RdRp targeted therapeutics into full gear.
