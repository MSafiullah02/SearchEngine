Despite ongoing conceptual, theoretical, and empirical debates, a large number of retrospective self-report scales have been produced to ostensibly measure various classes of such behaviour. These scales are typically based on a variety of theoretical and diagnostic frameworks. Given current conceptual ambiguities, building on previous studies, we evaluated the dimensional structure of 50 scales targeting the assessment of supposedly problematic behaviours in relation to four technologies: Internet, smartphones, video games, and social network sites. We find that two dimensions ('compulsive use' and 'negative outcomes') account for over 50% of all scale-items analysed. With a median of five dimensions, on average, scales have considered fewer dimensions than various proposed diagnostic criteria and models. No relationships were found between the number of items in a scale and the number of dimensions, or the technology category and the dimensional structure. The findings indicate, firstly, that a majority of scales place an inordinate emphasis on some dimensions over others and, secondly, that despite differences in the items presented, at a dimensional level, there exists a high degree of similarity between scales. These findings highlight shortcomings in existing scales and underscore the need to develop more sophisticated conceptions and empirical tools to understand possible problematic interactions with various digital technologies.",

Described in relation to a range of technologies (e.g., games, smartphones, the Internet) such behaviours are typically framed as problematic and, in some cases, addictive [8, 21] . Examples include: Internet gaming disorder, problematic media use, Internet addiction, and technology use addiction among many other labels. Despite the widespread adoption of various umbrella terms, some researchers have criticised the use of these labels, arguing that, in many cases, the behaviours and outcomes referred to are often particularly heterogeneous, influenced by a variety of personal characteristics, and potentially driven by distinct etiological mechanisms [13, 15] . For the purposes of this paper, acknowledging the ambiguity, the term problematic media use will be adopted to refer, broadly, to various forms of pathological or addictive engagements with digital technologies.",

At a theoretical level, for many proposed technology-related addictions, a conceptual consensus has yet to be reached [9, 13, 17] . Furthermore, many competing theoretical frameworks have been proposed for the same supposed construct. Laconi et al. [15] , for instance, note that Internet addiction is considered by some to be an impulse control disorder and, for others, a behavioural addiction, or even a combination of the two. Additionally, further contributing to the conceptual quagmire, studies have shown a number of comorbid psychopathologies (e.g., depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or anxiety disorders) with various forms of problematic media use [14] . Finally, there exist criticisms that many definitions are pathologising everyday behaviour [10, 11] . This is especially the case for gaming-related behaviours where researchers have struggled to differentiate between higher levels of engagement and truly problematic use [13] .",

He argues that such components are not only key for substance-related addictions but, from the perspective of a biopsychosocial framework of the individual, are also present in behavioural addictions.",

Adopting a tendency present in much of modern Social Psychology [4] , researchers have relied on retrospective self-report questionnaires (or scales) to assess individuals' propensities for various behaviours, disorders, or other related outcomes. This has seen the proliferation of an inordinate number of scales designed to assess various forms of problematic media use, many of which target the same or substantially overlapping constructs (e.g., the Smartphone Addiction Scale, the Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale, and the Problematic Mobile Phone Use Questionnaire). Owing to the scale-development processes typically followed, such measures are normally reliable. Ellis et al.

Nevertheless, in a review of 45 tools designed to assess Internet addiction, Laconi et al. [15] found that only 26 had been evaluated for their psychometric properties.

All scale-items were pooled into seven categories on the basis of their conceptual similarity: compulsive use, negative outcomes, salience, withdrawal symptoms, mood regulation, escapism, and social comfort. For scales targeting Internet addiction, this analysis found that 'compulsive use' and 'negative outcomes' were the two most prominent dimensions assessed, followed by 'salience'.

In particular, the study aims to analyse the dimensional structure of the items presented in these scales in relation to prominent diagnostic criteria for substance dependence, models of behavioural addiction, and previous research in this regard, for four technologies frequently considered in the literature: the Internet, smartphones, video games, and social network sites (SNSs). Such a study will, firstly, aid in identifying shortcomings in existing scales, secondly, contribute a degree of conceptual clarity, thirdly, extend previous research focusing on only a single form of technology and, fourthly, provide a clearer foundation for improved assessment tools. To this end, building on the guidelines provided by Webster and Watson [18] , a systematic review methodology was adopted to identify, collect, extract, and analyse a sample of such assessment tools.",

During the initial During three iterative rounds of review new codes were developed to account for items not captured by the seven a priori dimensions. These dimensions and their descriptions are provided in Table 2 . With the exception of cognitive absorption, these dimensions were primarily tangential to problematic media use. Agarwal and Karahanna [1, p. 655] define cognitive absorption to involve: (i) temporal resolution in which passage of time is not registered; (ii) total immersion in the activity where other basic needs are ignored; (iii) intensified pleasure in doing the activity; (iv) the user's perception of being responsible for the interaction; and (v) curiosity that responds to sensory and cognitive sensitivities. Following the development of these dimensions, items were re-categorised and moved to newly specified dimensions if deemed appropriate by all three coders. Table 3 provides a summary of the dimensional structure of the scales for each of the four technologies considered. Columns 2-5 present the number of items for a given dimension for each technology category, with the proportion of items in each category mapped to a given dimension represented in parentheses. The 'total' column represents the total for a given dimension across all technologies, Figure 2 depicts the distribution of the dimensions across the four technologies considered. [5] -all items in this scale were mapped to withdrawal symptoms. Following these two dimensions, 47 and 42 scales included items assessing withdrawal symptoms and salience, respectively. In contrast, the three remaining a priori dimensions -escapism, mood regulation, and social comfortwere only included in 28, 26, and 11 scales respectively. Of the newly created categories, only cognitive absorption appeared with any frequency, being used in nine different scales (through 16 items). A Chi-square test of independence was calculated comparing the proportional frequency of each of the dimensions for each technology category. Owing to the relatively small number of observations for SNSs, this analysis was only conducted for the three remaining technology categories (the Internet, smartphones, and video gaming). The analysis revealed no statistically significant interaction between the technology category and the proportional distribution of dimensions (\u03c7 2 (22) = 29.82, p = 0.123).",

In particular, it is necessary to understand the factors distinguishing various proposed disorders, or whether they are merely manifestations of other underlying factors, pathologies, or individual characteristics.

Moreover, with the exception of SNSs, where 'withdrawal symptoms' was similarly frequent, these dimensions accounted for a majority of items presented. For all technology categories, while the absolute number of items and the specific questions posed differed, the overall dimensional structure was found to be particularly comparable. The prominence of compulsive use and negative outcomes supports Lortie and Guitton [16] who found a similar outcome when analysing 14 scales produced prior to 2012 only targeting Internet-related addiction. For compulsive use, a possible explanation, in both cases, rests on the inclusion of tolerance, considered by some to be a separate dimension, in its description. Nevertheless, given the imbalance in dimensions considered, future studies need to consider, firstly, how representative these scales are of the supposed dimensions of technology-related behavioural addictions and, secondly, whether under-representation of particular dimensions is a valid concern. Furthermore, researchers intending to use an existing scale should, in addition to considering the scale description, account for the dimensional structure of items when determining the fit between a scale and their research questions.",

Despite the systematic approach adopted, there are, nonetheless, a number of limitations which bare acknowledgement. First, while the search string was designed to enable the collection of a comprehensive sample, there remains the possibility that relevant scales could have been inadvertently omitted. Furthermore, while four distinct technology categories were used, it is acknowledged that, in many cases it is not possible to distinguish between them. For instance, many uses of a smartphone involve engagement with the Internet or various SNSs. This is especially the case for scales targeting Internet-related behaviours. While an imperfect solution, scales were allocated to a category on the basis of their titles and original descriptions. Finally, while the a priori dimensions used were based on related previous research [16] , it is acknowledged that, although general characteristics of behavioural addictions are likely to exist [8] , dimensions pertinent to one domain might not be well-suited to other domains (e.g., Internet vs. gaming-related behaviour). Similarly, in using Lortie and Guitton [16] 's dimensions the 'tolerance' dimension from the component model [8] was not included as an explicit dimension itself. Rather, as with Lortie and Guitton [16] , it was considered to be an element of 'compulsive use'.",

Lortie and Guitton [16, p. 108] note that the dimensional structure of an assessment questionnaire is inherently linked to the researchers' conception of the phenomenon of interest. Consequently, the findings of the study provide a lens through which to interpret current conceptions of purportedly pathological interactions with technology. Overwhelmingly, a majority of scale-items concern compulsive use, negative outcomes associated with use and, to a lesser extent, withdrawal symptoms. Therefore, whether intentional or not, these dimensions are seen by researchers to be central to various conceptions of problematic use. Building on this study, efforts should be made to establish conceptual clarity about what constitutes problematic or addictive technology interactions and, on this basis, curb the development of novel scales, consolidate existing items, and conduct more extensive validations of current scales. Only with more sophisticated and theoretically-sound measurement tools will we be able to produce the empirical evidence necessary for truly understanding the existence and possible nature of problematic engagements with various digital technologies.",
