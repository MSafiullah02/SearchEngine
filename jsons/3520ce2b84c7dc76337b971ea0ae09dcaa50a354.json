Standard concentrations of chlorine in public water supplies fail to destroy Giardia cysts, and conventional water testing commonly does not detect small degrees of ~ontamination.'~~ Giardia lamblia occurs worldwide, and is associated with overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions and poor water quality control, although in the developed world most cases are probably acquired by person-to-person transm i s~i o n . ~ In experiments in which human volunteers were infected, Rentdorff showed that infection could occur following the ingestion of as few as 10 cysts, and that 100 Giardia organisms caused Giardia infection in 50% of These studies also demonstrated that infection may be asymptomatic, or cause short-lived diarrhoeal illness. Most subjects (86%) eradicated the parasites spontaneously, only two out of 21 infested volunteers continuing to excrete cysts in their stools after 3 months. Sagi et al. found that infestation disappeared spontaneously in six out of seven positive children re-examined after a year,12 but some asymptomatic carriers may excrete the cysts for many years. 13 Longitudinal data on Giardia excretion indicate the natural history in children commonly exposed to infection. In 45 Guatemalan children followed from birth through 3 years, all children acquired at least one Giardia infection, and more than 40% of infections lasted 2-6 weeks or more.'4 Prevalence to incidence ratios were low in the first 9 months of life indicating that Giardia events were short-lived, but increased substantially during the second and third years of life, consistent with more persistent infections. Simultaneous infection with other enteropathogens was a feature of that environment, which may in part account for the observation that weight-velocity growth was lower in the second year in Giardia-positive children. Another longitudinal investigation of the health effects of Giardia was undertaken in Egypt, where 42 [2] [3] [4] year olds had stools examined weekly for 6 months. All but one child acquired Giardia during the study. 15 Forty-two per cent of specimens examined were Giardiapositive, and the mean duration of excretion in Giardia-positive children was 7% weeks, with a range of 1-17 weeks. Clinical symptoms of illness occurred frequently within 1 month before or after Giardia excretion, but no statistical association could be demonstrated.",

Infected patients may remain symptomatic for years. 22 Children with chronic giardiasis may present with a coeliac-like syndrome, characterized by anorexia, growth retardation, weight loss, abdominal pain, chronic diarrhoea, wasted musculature, abdominal distension, anaemia and steatorrhoeag~~~ Pathological findings on small bowel biopsy, however, do not correlate well with the disease state. 24 Malabsorption occurring in children with Giardia, which responds rapidly to anti-parasitic medication, is one extreme of the spectrum of infection. Pathological changes might depend on the presence of large numbers of the protozoa or on host factors, such as lowered immunity (systemic or in the gut) or disturbances of gastrointestinal function and/or flora from other causes. The factors responsible for converting an asymptomatic into symptomatic Giardia infection are unknown, but may be inherent in the host and not in the ~r g a n i s m .~ Toxigenicity and invasiveness are two qualities, possessed to a limited degree by Giardia, which are usually counterbalanced by the immune mechanisms of the normal host.

The presence of Giardia lamblia cysts or trophozoites in a child with diarrhoea was taken to incriminate Giardia as the causative organism. The authors identified an enteropathogen in only 3 of the 68 single cases of diarrhoea that occurred, although an enteropathogen was identified in all 15 outbreaks. Shigella was the only pathogen identified in five outbreaks, rotavirus in two, and Giardia lamblia in one. In the remaining seven outbreaks, multiple enteropathogens were identified (four with rotavirus and Giardia; three with other multiple pathogens). Rotavirus and Giardia occurred only in children less than 3 years of age; shigellosis occurred at all ages. In only one of the single cases of diarrhoea was there secondary spread (to one of 175 family members = 0.6%), whereas in 'outbreaks' the occurrence of diarrhoeal illness in families whose DCC child had shigellosis was 26%, for Giardia enteritis it was 17%, and for rotavirus infection it was 15%. The average duration of outbreaks was 2.4 weeks; this duration was considered in part due to inadequate exclusion of ill children5' Parents of children with diarrhoea would often deny that their children were ill, resulting in the continued attendance of sick children at DCC; there was an absence of centre policies regarding the exclusion of ill children and their eventual readmission, parallelling the absence of State regulations. The authors concluded that DCC might play an important part in the epidemiology and transmission of gastroenteritis in the United States.58 For the majority of the diarrhoeal episodes, aetiology remained undetermined and was attributed to viruses other than rotavirus. Viruses subsequently shown to be associated with childhood diarrhoea but which were not tested for in that study were human calciviruses, enteric adenoviruses (types 40 and 41), astroviruses, coronaviruses, and unclassified, small, round vi r u~e s . 5~",

Enteric symptoms reported by a parent or teacher did not differ significantly when groups of cyst excreters, cyst and trophozoite excreters, and non-excreters were compared. None of the three children assessed as underweight on World Health Organization international standards was Giardia positive. The high prevalence of infection was attributed to the susceptibility of young children to gut colonization, and the close-clustering that occurs in child care centres with its opportunities for person-to-person transmission. 62 The high prevalence and incidence of giardiasis in children in day care and the lack of association of parasite excretion with symptoms has been borne out by many other studies in young children, particularly those in group care. A number of studies are summarized in Table 2 and support the following conclusions: (i) Giardia lamblia infection is prevalent in children cared for within DCC, with a peak incidence in the 1-3 year age group; (ii) the appearance of Giardia cysts or trophozoites in the stools is not always associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. nor is their continued passage; (iii) some children continue to excrete Giardia for prolonged periods; and (iv) there is no evidence of impaired nutritional status as judged by height, weight or haemoglobin level.62-66 The variability in the effects of giardiasis is unexpJained, but heterogeneity of strains could contribute to this.\"'",

Antimicrobial therapy for giardiasis is of established benefit?' and the standard treatment in Australia is metronidazole (Flagyl, Mayand Baker; Metrozine, Searle, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Metrogyl, Alphapharm, Sydney, NSW, Australia), or tinidazole (Fasigyn, Pfizer, Sydney, NSW, A~stralia).~' Metronidazole is also effective in treatment of amoebiasis, trichomonas, Clostridiurn difficile and anaerobes. The imidazole derivatives have a mildly unpleasant metallic after-taste and can cause other side effects, especially as the duration of treatment increases. Efficacy of treatment for giardiasis varies from 50% for single-dose regimens, up to 97% for 7-10 days of therapy. The potential for side effects, the lack of complete efficacy in eliminating infection and the inadvisability of treating pregnant women (especially if asymptomatic) with metronida~ole,7~ must be borne in mind in any attempt to eliminate Giardiafrom the DCC setting.",

However, the treatment of asymptomatic children with Giardia who attend DCC is controversial. Some have argued for case-finding and treatment of all asymptomatic carriers within a closed community for effective public health control purposess~39~47~53~69 However, as other aetiologic agents causing diarrhoea have been documented, and the evidence from prospective studies shows a lack of adverse outcomes of asymptomatic carriage of Giardia,12,14-'6.63-66 case-finding and treatment of asymptomatic carriers in DCC appears unwarranted. Control of diarrhoeal illness may be difficult to achieve even when measures that include treatment and isol-ation of both symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers are implemented.74. 75 The conclusions of many investigators who have addressed the issue of treatment of asymptomatic carriers based upon the data from their own and other studies are as follows: (i) there is no evidence to support the routine treatment or exclusion from DCC of children who are asymptomatic carriers of Giardia lamblia, or of routine testing of asymptomatic contacts of symptomatic infected ~h i l d r e n ;~~~~ and (ii) complete eradication of the parasite in this setting is impractical because of the failure to detect all carriers on stool examination, treatment failures from currently available anti-parasitic drugs, poor tolerance of these agents, problems with compliance, cost of the medication, concerns about the safety of the medications and the constant potential for reinfection. In view of the lack of adverse consequences associated with Giardia carriage, treatment of asymptomatic infections is not justified. However, parents of stool-positive children should seek medical advice in the event of prolonged diarrhoea, and contacts of children with confirmed giardiasis need only seek medical advice if diarrhoea, symptoms of malabsorption or failure to thrive develop.58",

Following the intervention, prevalences declined in all groups, but less dramatically in the no exclusion group at 1 month, although by 6 months Giardia prevalences between intervention groups were not significantly different. Children newly admitted to the centres during the intervention period had a Giardia prevalence of 10.6%, and accounted for approximately 40% of Giardia infection present at 6 months. The authors concluded that the stricter intervention policy resulted in greater cost in terms of child day care and parents' work days lost, but not in significantly better control of Giardia infections in the day care environment, and that stricter policies might result in children being moved to different centres.",

What then is a reasonable approach to diagnosis and management of diarrhoeal illness occurring in a child who attends a DCC? Both the severity and duration of symptoms will influence a decision to investigate. Trial of metronidazole should not be used to incriminate Giardia in the absence of a microbiological diagnosis, since an apparent response may be the result of the self-limiting nature of most diarrhoeal illness or, occasionally, the effectiveness of antiparasitic drugs in treating other pathogens. Repeated a n d inappropriate anti-protozoal treatment should be avoided. Unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion, there is little value in pursuing a diagnosis of Giardia by ordering multiple stool specimens. Where Giardia is identified, it should be treated in a child who is experiencing gastrointestinal illness, but not in asymptomatic excretors, and children need not be excluded once they are well and have stools of normal consistency. There is no place for active case-finding in DCC in an attempt to eliminate giardial carriage from asymptomatic contacts.",
