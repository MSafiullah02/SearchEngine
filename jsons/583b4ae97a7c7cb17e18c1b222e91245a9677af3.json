            "text": "Over the past few months, the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has posed many challenges for practicing phyicians.Sarcoidosis patients may have an increased risk of a poor outcome and death from COVID-19 infection for several reasons. First, sarcoidosis involves the lung in approximately 90% of patients, 1 many of whom have diminished baseline lung function with reduced pulmonary reserve should they develop respiratory failure. Second, although the etiology of sarcoidosis is unknown, it is postulated that immunologic dysfunction and dysregulation play essential roles in the development of the disease. 2 Third, African-American race and many comorbidities associated with glucocorticoid (GC) therapies such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity have been identified by the Centers for Disease Control as independent risk factors for COVID-19-related death and are more prevalent in sarcoidosis cohorts. 3 Finally, and most pertinent to the treating clinician, immunosuppressive medications are the primary agents used for the treatment of sarcoidosis, particularly GCs, which are often the first line agent. 4 Little is known about the impact of sarcoidosis treatments on susceptibility to and disease expression of COVID-19 infection; however, because of the lethality of COVID-19 infection, there is concern that the risk-benefit ratio of effective immunosuppressive therapies for sarcoidosis may be altered in the current climate. In this document, we aim to provide clinicians with practical guidance on how to adjust immunosuppressive therapy for the treatment of sarcoidosis during the COVID-19 pandemic. This guidance Many of the immunosuppressive agents used to treat sarcoidosis are used in rheumatic diseases. Based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, it is known that these drugs, notably systemic GC and biological agents (such as TNF inhibitors), increase the risk for serious infections. 5, 6 Traditional steroid-sparing agents, most importantly methotrexate (MTX), are also associated with an increased risk of infection, but the degree of risk depends on the nature of the underlying illness, dosage, treatment duration and infection in question, 7 and is generally considered to be lower than that with GC and biologic agents. 7, 8 Although lowering immunosuppression might improve the outcome of a sarcoidosis patient who becomes exposed to COVID-19, it is also associated with the risk of worsening sarcoidosis. In practice, treating physicians are confronted with two general scenarios: first, a patient who is clinically quiescent maintained on a stable medical regimen; or second, a patient with active, organ-threatening disease.",

For example, if a patient is stable on weekly MTX, a dose reduction or dosing every other week instead of every week are reasonable options. An outright drug holiday for several weeks, while risk-benefit is continually reassessed, may be considered for some patients, but this could increase the chance for more abrupt sarcoidosis flares that may be more refractory to control and prompt additional GC therapy.

However, because of concern for rebound sarcoidosis flares, which may be problematic to control if these medications are discontinued abruptly, a gradual dose reduction could be considered. For example, infliximab (IFX) may be given less frequently (e.g., every six to eight weeks instead of monthly), or at a lower weight-based dose (e.g., 3 mg/kg instead of 5 mg/kg of body weight). In addition, premedication with GC could be reduced significantly or eliminated from the infusion protocol. When DMASDs are used for prevention of antibody formation in patients on TNF inhibitors, a low dose (e.g., methotrexate 10 mg weekly) is considered effective. 11 If immunosuppression is reduced, clinicians should instruct the sarcoidosis patient to be vigilant for any changes in their condition that are suggestive of active disease. The clinician should establish facile methods of communication with their patients including rapid consultation systems (such as telemedicine) and other appropriate safeguards.",

In patients with biologic therapies, such as IFX and adalimumab (ADA), therapy also should probably be continued because of the consequences of disease relapse. Due to logistic concerns (such as potential closure of infusion units), switching to home infusion of IFX or to subcutaneous ADA may be considered in carefully selected patients. In patients with active disease who cannot receive biologic therapies for logistic or clinical reasons, alternative treatments, such as tofacitinib, repository corticotropin, or others, may be considered on a case by case basis.
