The Ministry of Health has focused on closing gaps in medical resources by increasing availability of personal protective equipment and hospital beds and attempting to remedy overburden of health-care facilities and mortuary services in Guayas province, the country's main hotspot of the outbreak (appendix), but 417 health personnel in Ecuador have COVID-19.2\n",
