            "text": "In 1989, ganciclovir (GCV) became the first anticytomegalovirus (CMV) agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment and prevention of CMV infection and disease, followed by foscarnet (FOS), cidofovir (CDV), and valganciclovir (Table 1). All of these agents target the CMV DNA polymerase encoded by the UL54 gene (pUL54) to ultimately inhibit viral DNA synthesis. While these agents have dramatically reduced the burden of CMV infection in the hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipient [1], their use is often limited by toxicities such as myelosuppression and renal injury, and the development of resistance [2]. Therefore, agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved toxicity profiles are clearly needed. In 2017, letermovir became the first antiCMV agent with a mechanism of action other than inhibition of DNA polymerase activity to be approved by the FDA. This review will discuss recent developments in CMV antiviral agents and non-pharmacological interventions that may augment the ability to prevent and treat CMV infections in HCT recipients.",

The viral terminase complex cleaves concatameric viral DNA into full-length genomes and then packages a single genome into the viral nucleocapsid as part of new virion formation [3]. The core terminase complex is comprised of the proteins pUL51, pUL56, and pUL89; all three proteins are necessary for terminase function [4, 5]. Targeting the terminase complex represents an attractive therapeutic option since host cellular DNA replication does not require terminase functions and all three terminase proteins are individually essential for viral replication [6]. The first terminase inhibitors were the benzimidazole D-ribonucleosides such as BDCRB and TCRB [3]. Clinical development was halted after preclinical studies demonstrated unfavorable in vivo metabolism [7]. Other terminase inhibitors such as GW275175X [7] and tomeglovir (BAY 38-4766) [8] were not brought to clinical trials.",

Letermovir exerts mild-to-moderate inhibitory effects on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and increases exposure to tacrolimus, sirolimus, and cyclosporine [13, 14]; these require monitoring and dose adjustment as needed when co-administered with letermovir. The dose of letermovir should be reduced by 50% (from 480 to 240 mg/day) when co-administered with cyclosporine [13]. Letermovir reduces voriconazole exposure but does not appear to affect posaconazole [15, 16]. Letermovir is contraindicated in persons receiving ergot alkaloids and in persons receiving certain statins along with cyclosporine [17]. Although letermovir is well tolerated in the setting of mild-to-moderate hepatic and renal impairment, it should be used with caution in severe hepatic impairment (ChildPugh Class C) and insufficient data exist to guide dose adjustments if the creatinine clearance is < 10 mL/min [18, 19].",

A subset of patients were categorized as CMV high-risk, including HLA-A, B, or DR mismatch related donor, HLA-A, B, C, and DRB1 mismatch unrelated donor, haploidentical donor, cord blood transplant, ex vivo T cell\u2013depleted graft, or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of grade 2 or greater requiring \u2265 1 mg/kg/day prednisone (or equivalent). Letermovir prophylaxis at 480 mg/day (240 mg/day if co-administered with cyclosporine) was begun at a median of 9 days after HCT and continued through week 14 post-HCT, and during this time, weekly CMV PCR monitoring was performed. Preemptive therapy was initiated upon detection of viremia according to local practice, with protocol-suggested viral load thresholds of 150 copies/mL in high-risk patients and 300 copies/mL in non-high-risk patients. Patients with detectable viremia prior to randomization were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis. Letermovir prophylaxis met the primary endpoint of reduction in clinically significant CMV infection (requiring initiation of preemptive therapy or CMV disease) compared with placebo at 24 weeks (17.5% vs 41.8%). Since CMV disease was uncommon in both groups, this endpoint was largely defined by reduction in the need for initiation of preemptive therapy; as such, the benefit of letermovir prophylaxis will depend on the viral load threshold for initiating preemptive therapy. Importantly, letermovir prophylaxis was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality at 24 weeks, with this benefit being predominantly among high-risk patients. As CMV disease was rare and no single predominant cause of death was identified [23\u2022], the reason(s) for the mortality benefit at week 24 remain unclear. The reduction in mortality appeared to correlate with the prevention of CMV viremia, raising the hypothesis that the beneficial impact of letermovir prophylaxis may be related to preventing indirect negative effects of CMV infection [24\u201326]. Adverse events including gastrointestinal effects (nausea, diarrhea), myelotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity were similar in the letermovir and placebo groups. Based on these results, letermovir was approved by the FDA for primary CMV prophylaxis in adult CMV seropositive allogeneic HCT recipients [17].",

Letermovir-resistant mutants do not display a significant growth defect compared to wild-type CMV, even with mutations which confer complete (> 3000-fold) resistance, such as at codon C325 of UL56 [27].

An analysis of resistance during the phase 3 prophylaxis study was performed, focusing on identifying resistance-associated mutations in UL56 primarily and UL89 secondarily [32\u2022]. UL56 genotyping was successful in 50 out of 79 patients (63%) who received letermovir prophylaxis and experienced CMV infection through week 24. Four UL56 resistance mutations were identified in 3 patients (6% of 50 patients analyzed). These 3 patients represented 16.7% of patients (N = 18) who experienced CMV infection while receiving letermovir prophylaxis and for whom UL56 genotyping was successfully performed. One of the 3 patients was viremic at the time letermovir prophylaxis was initiated (viral load < 151 copies/mL) and another patient missed 5 doses of letermovir. Of the four UL56 resistance mutations identified, two were previously documented resistance mutations (V236M and C235W), and two were novel mutations (E237G and R369T) at positions previously demonstrated to confer resistance in vitro [27, 28]. There were no UL89 substitutions documented that had previously had been identified as conferring resistance in vitro [30]; UL51 was not analyzed. Outside of these studies, cases of breakthrough infection and disease with letermovir-resistant virus have been reported in adult and pediatric HCT recipients receiving letermovir primary or secondary prophylaxis [33\u201335].",

            "text": "With a novel mechanism of action and proven ability to safely and effectively prevent CMV infection after HCT, letermovir represents a substantial addition to the CMV antiviral armamentarium that should demonstrably improve CMV-related outcomes in HCT recipients. However, important questions remain that will require additional study, including:Determining the optimal duration of letermovir prophylaxis. In the phase 3 prophylaxis study, clinically significant CMV infection developed in ~ 10% of patients (~ 20% in those at high risk of CMV) between week 14, when letermovir was discontinued, and week 24 [22\u2022\u2022]. This raises the question as to whether a longer duration of prophylaxis may be of benefit, as was found for valganciclovir after high-risk (CMV D+/R-) solid organ transplant (SOT) [36]. A phase 3 clinical trial will compare 100 vs 200 days of letermovir prophylaxis in CMV seropositive allogeneic HCT recipients, with the primary outcome measure being clinically significant CMV infection through week 28 post-HCT (NCT03930615).Further defining the benefit of letermovir prophylaxis in high-risk HCT populations. High-risk patients comprised 31% of the total study population in the phase 3 prophylaxis study, with haploidentical transplant recipients comprising 14.3%, cord blood recipients 4%, and ex vivo T cell\u2013depleted recipients 2.5% [22\u2022\u2022]. Additional study is needed, with some data already emerging [37, 38], to define the relative benefit of letermovir prophylaxis in specific high-risk HCT recipients who were relatively underrepresented in the study but for whom the benefit of letermovir prophylaxis appeared greatest.Determining whether there is a role for letermovir in preemptive therapy or treatment of CMV disease. The use of letermovir monotherapy for these indications is not currently recommended due to the lack of supporting data. Notably, in the phase 3 prophylaxis study, 48 patients with detectable CMV viremia (viral load in all cases < 1000 copies/mL) prior to randomization received letermovir, thereby essentially receiving letermovir as preemptive therapy; of those, approximately 33% had clinically significant CMV infection by week 14 [22\u2022\u2022, 39]. Additionally, concerns exist about the relatively low barrier to resistance in vitro, and emerging reports describe the development of resistance when used in the setting of active infection [40\u201343]. An ongoing clinical trial (NCT03728426) will evaluate the safety and efficacy of letermovir as salvage treatment of CMV infection or disease.Given their distinct mechanisms of action, the combination of letermovir with DNA polymerase inhibitors represents an attractive possibility for the treatment of CMV due to the potential for additive or even synergistic antiviral activity. In one study, the combination of letermovir with the DNA polymerase inhibitors ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir demonstrated only an additive, not synergistic, effect in vitro [44]. However, another study found a small degree of synergy between letermovir and brincidofovir, an oral prodrug of cidofovir [45]. More work, both clinical and in vitro, is required to address the potential utility of letermovir-based combination therapy.Determining the safety and efficacy of letermovir in pediatric HCT recipients. Studies of letermovir to date have been limited to adult patients. A phase 2b study of letermovir in pediatric HCT recipients is underway (NCT03940586) in order to provide much needed information pertaining to optimal dosing, safety, and efficacy in this population.",

            "text": "Maribavir is an orally available, benzimidazole L-riboside ATP competitive inhibitor of the CMV UL97 kinase (pUL97) [46]. This mechanism of action was revealed through selection of a resistant virus containing a mutation in UL97 [46]. pUL97 is a broadly acting kinase that phosphorylates viral and host cellular proteins [47]. Unlike the CMV DNA polymerase pUL54 or components of the terminase complex, pUL97 is not absolutely essential for replication in tissue culture [6]. Instead, mutant viruses deleted of the entire UL97 gene, or in which pUL97 kinase activity has been abrogated, are viable but display severe growth defects [6, 48\u201351]. The critical function(s) of pUL97 that contributes to efficient CMV replication and is affected by maribavir to result in inhibition of viral replication remains poorly defined. Maribavir inhibits viral egress from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through inhibition of pUL97-dependent phosphorylation of the nuclear lamina component lamin A/C [52], although the relative contribution of this to maribavir\u2019s overall antiviral activity remains to be determined.",

The reason for this difference is not entirely clear, but one possibility is that cell conditions modulate the activity of cellular kinases which can compensate for loss of pUL97 activity in the presence of maribavir [53]. Indeed, the addition of cellular kinase inhibitors reduces the maribavir EC50 in HFFs to values comparable to HELs [53]. Since maribavir inhibits pUL97 activity and ganciclovir depends on pUL97-mediated phosphorylation for its activity, maribavir and ganciclovir are antagonistic [53]. Maribavir retains activity against most CMV strains resistant to DNA polymerase inhibitors [46, 54, 55] but, similar to letermovir, is not active against other herpesviruses [55].",

The doses of maribavir evaluated were 100 mg twice daily, 400 mg once daily, and 400 mg twice daily to start at engraftment (between 14 and 30 days after HCT) and continue for a maximum of 12 weeks after HCT. The primary endpoint was the incidence and time to onset of CMV infection or disease. All doses of maribavir demonstrated reduction in CMV infection as determined by detection of pp65 antigenemia or DNA PCR. CMV disease occurred in only 3 participants, all of whom were randomized to receive placebo. Adverse events were more common in the group receiving 400 mg twice daily compared with lower doses of maribavir and placebo; these consisted primarily of taste disturbance (31%) and gastrointestinal disturbances (28%) (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysphagia). All doses yielded similar trough concentrations but peak plasma concentrations were ~ 2.5\u00d7 higher following 400 mg doses compared with 100 mg doses, and the 24-h drug exposure was greatest in those taking 400 mg twice daily.",

Maribavir was begun following engraftment (median of 24 days post-HCT) and administered for 12 weeks after HCT. Disappointingly, maribavir prophylaxis failed to show a reduction in CMV infection or disease compared with placebo at either day 100 or 6 months after HCT. Similarly, maribavir prophylaxis at 100 mg orally twice daily did not meet noninferiority compared with oral ganciclovir for the endpoints of prevention of CMV infection or disease in high-risk (CMV D+/R\u2212) liver transplant recipients [65]. The reason(s) for the failure of maribavir in both studies are unclear [66, 67].

Forty patients were randomized to each treatment dose arm; of these approximately 40% were HCT recipients. 64.2% had asymptomatic infection, and end-organ disease was present in 13.3%. The median viral load at baseline was 3.7 log10 copies/mL. Eighty-six patients (72%) achieved an undetectable viral load. CMV-associated clinical manifestations improved in 24/34 (71%) patients and resolved in 6/34 (18%) by week 6 of treatment. Twenty-five patients (29%) who cleared viremia subsequently experienced CMV recurrence while receiving maribavir; 13 (52%) of these were associated with the emergence of maribavir-resistant virus (discussed below). The recurrence rate was lower among HCT recipients (26%) than among SOT recipients (40%) despite similar rates of virologic clearance (70% vs 64%, respectively). All efficacy endpoints were similar across all doses. Altered taste was the most common adverse effect (65%) but this resulted in treatment discontinuation in only one patient. Overall, this study demonstrated that maribavir may be a valid option in the setting of resistant or refractory infection, but the high rate of recurrence while on therapy and the associated emergence of maribavir resistance represent cause for concern. A phase 3 study of maribavir in HCT and SOT recipients with resistant or refractory CMV infections is underway (NCT02931539).",

Patients were assigned to receive oral maribavir 400 mg, 800 mg, or 1200 mg twice daily or valganciclovir at a 900 mg twice daily for weeks 1 through 3 followed by 900 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

Filociclovir, similar to GCV, is a nonobligate chain terminator of DNA synthesis that requires initial phosphorylation by pUL97, followed by additional phosphorylation steps performed by cellular kinases to its active triphosphate form [79\u201382]. Filociclovir EC50 values for CMV strains are approximately 0.2\u20130.3 \u03bcM, which are ~ 5-fold less than for GCV [78, 83\u201385]. The increased potency of filociclovir compared with GCV in vitro may reflect the findings that filociclovir is a better substrate for pUL97 than GCV [80, 86] and the CMV DNA polymerase incorporates filociclovir-triphosphate into DNA more efficiently than GCV-triphosphate [82]. Filociclovir displays little cytotoxicity at concentrations required to inhibit CMV replication in a variety of cell types [81] and demonstrated efficacy in a mouse model of CMV infection [87]. In addition to CMV, filociclovir is active against HHV-6 but not HSV1, HSV2, or VZV [81].",

The pentameric complex consists of gH/gL/pUL128/pUL130/pUL131, is required for CMV entry into several clinically relevant cell types, and elicits potent neutralizing antibody responses that block entry into those cells [96, 99]. A CMV vaccine candidate (V160) incorporating the pentameric complex was constructed from the live attenuated CMV AD169 strain that was further engineered to be replication-defective in the absence of a synthetic compound called Shield-1 [100]. Recently, this vaccine was found to be safe and elicited robust levels of neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses when administered to CMV-seronegative subjects in a phase 1 study [101, 102]. Several other candidate vaccines are currently being evaluated in phase 1 and 2 trials in adult and pediatric HCT recipients [96].",
