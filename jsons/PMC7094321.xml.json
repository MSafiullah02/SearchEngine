Cellular uptake can be <2% of the dose,10,11 depending on ON chemistry and cell type, whereas further intracellular barriers hinder transport of the internalized ON to the active site. As a result, ON concentration at the active site, especially in terms of in vivo drug delivery, may be too low for an effective and sustained outcome. At the very least, the efficiency of ON delivery is rather poor in terms of cost\u2010effective drug development. Indeed, a majority of the current and past research focuses on the improvement of ON stability and delivery through modification of the ON structure itself5,12, 13, 14 or via the use of delivery vehicles, which can both protect the drug from degradation as well as improve ON delivery into cells. The purpose of this communication is to review the mechanism of ON cellular uptake as well as both some of the common and more novel ON cellular delivery methods.",

However, a basic understanding of the proposed and potential actual mechanism(s) of ON uptake would be most useful for not only delivery of naked ONs but also development of optimal delivery systems. The most widely accepted mechanism of ON uptake is adsorptive endocytosis, whereby adsorption of the ON to the cell membrane results in transport of ON into the cell via endocytosis.15,16 However, intracellular localization of ON varies depending on cell type or experimental method. In some uptake studies, a significant proportion of internalized ON remains solely sequestered within the endosomal compartment, as evidenced by a punctate distribution of fluorescently labeled ON in the cell.15,17 If the ON is unable to escape the endosome, lysosomal degradation is likely. However, other research suggests that the ON escapes the endosome and is either rapidly transported to the nucleus or accumulates in perinuclear organelles.11,18,19 Currently, the mechanisms by which ONs escape lysosomal degradation and are transported into the cytosol and nucleus remain unclear. Other mechanisms of ON cellular uptake have been proposed such as pinocytosis20 and caveolar potocytosis.18\n",

A number of modifications to the native phosphodiester (PO) DNA backbone have been synthesized to improve the target affinity, intracellular delivery, or stability of ONs in the presence of abundant exo\u2010 and endonucleases. Currently, the most commonly investigated ONs are the phosphorothioate (PS), methylphosphonate (MP), and chimeric backbones containing mixed backbone chemistries, and peptide nucleic acids (PNA; Figure 1). Although the PS modification retains the aqueous solubility of the native PO backbone while increasing ON stability in the presence of nucleases, the anionic charge hinders uptake through the lipophilic membrane, resulting in poor cellular uptake (Table 1). However, ONs with an anionic backbone, like the PO and PS modifications, bind to cell surface proteins resulting in adsorptive endocytosis. In contrast to anionic ONs, neutral molecules like the MP and PNA have surprisingly low cellular uptake, resulting from low cell surface protein binding, and therefore exhibit decreased adsorptive endocytosis.",

Indeed, several barriers to cellular uptake exist, which must be overcome improve ON cellular delivery. The first barrier is the lipophilic cell membrane, through which these large, anionic molecules must pass to reach the site of action. Additionally, many ONs appear to enter the cell by endocytosis, as already mentioned, resulting in sequestration of the molecules inside endosomes. Again, the ON must pass through the endosomal membrane or risk lysosomal degradation. Finally, although evidence exists that once inside the cytosol ONs are rapidly transported to the nucleus,28,29 nucleases within the intracellular milieu can degrade the ON, rendering it inactive. Ideally, optimal delivery of ONs to the site of action would be based on a thorough understanding of the mechanism of ON uptake. However, because the mechanism of ON transport into the cell remains to be fully elucidated, many researchers have focused on the empirical development of various novel delivery vehicles that circumvent the barriers to uptake to improve the efficacy and ultimately the activity of ONs.",

At physiologic pH, CHEMS stabilizes DOPE into lamellar phase liposomes. However, at acidic pH, such as that in the early endosome, CHEMS undergoes protonation, resulting in formation of a hexagonal HII phase and subsequent fusion or destabilization of the endosomal membrane and release of ON to the cytosol.41, 42, 43, 44, 45 By altering their lipid composition, pH\u2010sensitive liposomes can have increased stability at physiologic pH, which would improve circulation time in vivo. Additionally, pH\u2010sensitive liposomes also have fusogenic properties at low pH, resulting in release of the ON from the endosome to the cytosol.44 pH\u2010sensitive liposomes were used to deliver antisense ON against the Na+/myo\u2010inositol co\u2010transporter mRNA in astrocytes.43 Cellular uptake of ON was more efficient when pH\u2010sensitive liposomes were used, compared with free ON or non\u2010pH\u2010sensitive liposomes (lecithin), as determined using fluorescence microscopy. In addition, pH\u2010sensitive liposome delivery resulted in a 50\u2010fold decrease of target mRNA expression compared with free ON, suggesting that liposome encapsulation can have a significant impact of ON delivery to the site of action. However, evidence suggests that small (<200 nm) pH\u2010sensitive liposomes composed of DOPE/OA are stabilized in the presence of human plasma via insertion of hydrophobic plasma molecules into the liposome.46 Consequently, the liposomes lose their pH sensitivity and therefore may have decreased drug delivery capability in vivo.

Therefore, CD\u2013ON formulations must be optimized to retain the improved delivery and stability of ONs while lengthening the time frame in which CD are also protective.

The advantage of microsphere formulation is slow release of encapsulated drug. For example, De Rosa et al. investigated the cellular uptake of poly dT(4\u201316) ONs encapsulated in 30\u201360 \u03bcM P(LA\u2010GA) micropheres in HeLa cells.108 Release of ON from microspheres was triphasic, indicating an initial burst phase, a slow\u2010release phase occurring over \u223c15 days, and eventually bulk erosion of the microsphere. Additionally, both encapsulation efficiency and release rate of ON could be controlled by the addition of polyethylenimine (PEI). Interestingly, confocal microscopy of HeLa cells incubated with ON, ON/PEI, or microsphere\u2010encapsulated ON/PEI demonstrated increased cytosolic and nuclear delivery of rhodamine\u2010labeled ON. The authors proposed that the extracellular controlled release of ON from micropheres prevented saturation of pinocytotic uptake, resulting in increased cytoplasmic accumulation and nuclear delivery of ONs. Similar results have been demonstrated following encapsulation of c\u2010myc or tat PO\u2010ONs in 10\u201320 \u03bcm P(LA\u2010GA) microspheres.110 The authors found that ON release was triphasic, with an initial burst phase during the first 48 h and microsphere degradation after 25 days when microspheres were incubated in physiologic buffer. In addition, the stability of the ONs was significantly improved in the presence of serum, yet ON\u2010RNA hybridization was not hindered by microsphere encapsulation. Therefore, the development of microsphere delivery systems for ONs may not only improve cellular delivery of ONs, but will minimize the need for multiple dosing of ONs.",

Following the shockwave, cells were washed and placed under 3 bar of pressure. FITC\u2010ON uptake was measured by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, and TNF\u03b1 production was measured by ELISA. Cell viability remained >95%. Cell uptake was dependent on the number of shockwaves and ON concentration. ON distribution in the cell was initially homogenous, followed by accumulation in the nucleus. At 50 \u03bcM ON and using 250 shockwaves, up to 62% inhibition of TNF\u03b1 was observed compared with cells treated with ON in the absence of shockwaves.
