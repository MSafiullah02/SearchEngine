This group of diseases classically affects lower motor neuronal body which could be in the cranial nerve nuclei or spinal cord, the corresponding axon including its multiple branches, and the neuromuscular junction. Patients can have symptoms due to affection of any part of the motor neuron unit thus making this group of diseases quite heterogenous. Patients presenting acutely can have a range of symptoms. While some may require observation only, others could have lifethreatening complications. Occasionally, these conditions can have an acute presentation that necessitates admission to an intensive care unit. Patients suffering from acute non-traumatic neuromuscular weakness typically present with difficulties in protecting their airway with or without symptoms of respiratory distress. Certain neuromuscular diseases can also lead to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system which can lead to circulatory collapse, while others can be due to a consequence of prolonged critical illness. When respiratory symptoms do develop, these patients often require ventilation support with the use of invasive or noninvasive devices.",

Determining the etiology of the lesion A systematic approach to localization is to place the lesion within the nervous system. Disease can occur in the central nervous system (CNS), containing the brain and spinal cord, or peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS includes the cerebral motor cortex, corticospinal tracts, and spinal cord, and the PNS includes spinal nerves, nerve roots, nerve branches, neuromuscular junctions (NMJ), and muscles [1] . CNS and PNS lesions should be identifiable from a detailed neurologic examination. The distribution of motor weakness, presence of sensory involvement, presence or absence of deep tendon reflexes, and pain are all important in localizing the lesion in the nervous system. These features are listed for neuromuscular diseases that are commonly encountered in critical care ( Table 5 .1). The focus of the rest of this chapter will be to discuss neuromuscular diseases of the PNS in greater detail.",

These include trauma, infections like abscesses, inflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), tumors, degenerative diseases, vascular disease like stroke, toxicities like carbon monoxide poisoning, genetic diseases like leukodystrophies, and metabolic diseases like vitamin deficiencies. Appropriate imaging studies of the CNS and PNS based on the suspected site like computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or plain radiographs and perhaps a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination may be necessary to identify the primary disease. \u2022 Anterior horn cells-diseases affecting anterior horn cells include degenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and familial spinal atrophy, infections like poliomyelitis and West Nile virus as well as toxins like lead poisoning. Patient age, exposure history, family history, time course of disease, laboratory tests, nerve conduction studies, and CSF examination can help differentiate between these diseases. \u2022 Spinal nerve roots-diseases causing acute radiculopathies include trauma resulting in spinal disk herniation, infections like Lyme disease and varicella zoster virus, inflammatory diseases like acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP; Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome), neoplasms including lymphoma or multiple myeloma, as well as vascular diseases like arteriovenous malformations and vasculitis. \u2022 Peripheral spinal nerves and branchesdiseases can affect a single nerve, for instance, as a sequelae of nerve compression as in carpal tunnel syndrome, or multiple nerves. Mononeuropathy multiplex, an ischemic disease affecting multiple nerves, can occur as a result of diabetes mellitus (DM) or vasculitis. A symmetric polyneuropathy with weakness and sensory symptoms has a wide variety of causes, ranging from common such as DM, critical illness, HIV, and alcohol abuse, less common such as vitamin B12 deficiency and Lyme disease, to rare such as porphyria and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Symmetric polyneuropathy often occurs as an adverse effect of medication or as a manifestation of systemic disease. The characteristics (axonal or demyelinating) and rate of progression of disease can help differentiate between causes. \u2022 Neuromuscular junction (NMJ)-diseases of neuromuscular transmission that affect the presynaptic junction can interfere with acetylcholine (ACh) release as in botulism or affect voltage-gated presynaptic calcium channels as in Lambert-Eaton syndrome. Other less common presynaptic diseases include congenital myasthenic syndromes, severe hypermagnesemia, and tick paralysis. Diseases that affect the postsynaptic junction include the generation of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies in myasthenia gravis and inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by organophosphate poisoning. \u2022 Muscles-diseases of the muscle have a wide variety of causes, including inflammatory disorders such as critical illness and polymyositis, infections such as influenza, endocrinopathies such as hypothyroidism, metabolic myopathies such as hypokalemia, drugs and toxins such as corticosteroids or statins, and the various causes of rhabdomyolysis. The specific diagnosis may be suspected from the history and course of disease. The presence of features of a systemic illness such as systemic lupus erythematosus may be indicative of myositis. Medication, alcohol, or substance abuse may be a clue to drug-induced myopathy. History of endocrinopathies such as thyroid dysfunction could be a clue to diagnosis. A history of recurrent episodes of exertion-related hematuria and weakness could suggest a metabolic myopathy.",

Weakness of both CNS and PNS can be broadly classified as diffuse, involving all muscle groups in varying extents or focal, involving specific distributions of the brain, nerve, or muscle. Diffuse muscle weakness can involve muscles in a symmetric pattern or asymmetric pattern. Symmetric weakness can cause proximal or distal loss of muscle strength. As such, in patients with diffuse weakness, the physician should determine whether the loss of function is proximal or distal while obtaining patient history by asking which physical activities muscle weakness limits as well as by conducting a focused neurologic examination testing specific muscle group strength against resistance.",

Diseases that damage striated muscle fibers result in leakage of intracellular enzymes into the blood, where they become measurable by serum tests. These include creatine kinase [2, 3] , myoglobin, aldolase, transaminases, and lactic acid dehydrogenase [4, 5] . The presence of myoglobin in urinalysis can be a useful marker of muscle diseases. Myoglobin is an iron-protein compound present in the sarcoplasm of striated skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers, containing a red pigment that gives muscle its characteristic color. Muscle destruction regardless of cause therefore releases myoglobin, which due to its small size is filtered freely through the renal glomeruli and appears in the urine, a phenomenon referred to as \"myoglobinuria\" [5] . Specific autoantibody tests such as anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AChR-Ab), muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK-Ab), and voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies (VGKC-Ab) can help identify specific NMJ diseases. Moreover, detection of antibodies against extractable nuclear antigens such as anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, anti-Sm, and anti-RNP and myositis-associated antigens such as anti-histidyl-t-RNA synthase (anti-Jo-1) can be suggestive of an inflammatory myopathy or associated connective tissue disease [6] .",

Our goal in the next few paragraphs is to discuss the importance of these studies in the diagnosis of neuromuscular disease. Details of NCS and EMG interpretation are beyond the scope of this chapter. Most often, NCS, which are obtained using surface electrodes, is followed by EMG. NCS includes studies of compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) and sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs), which collectively provide valuable information about the integrity of motor and sensory nerve fibers. Analysis of amplitudes and latencies of CMAPs and SNAPs allows localization of the problem to axon, myelin sheath, nerve root, or branches.",

Collectively, NCS and EMG can be useful to localize peripheral weakness, identify characteristic features that narrow differential diagnoses, and identify affected muscles for biopsy [7] . They can differentiate between neuropathic and myopathic disease ( Fig. 5 .1) as well as identify defects in presynaptic or postsynaptic transmission, but the yield of these studies is higher when the electromyographer has an idea of clinically weak muscles and an idea of the differential diagnoses based on history and examination [8] . When clinically appropriate, certain specialized nerve conduction techniques can be employed, such as repetitive nerve stimulation and single fiber EMG for suspected disorders of neuromuscular transmission [6] as well as short or long exercise testing for suspected non-dystrophic myotonias and periodic paralysis [9] .",

Following electrode insertion into normal muscle at rest, a brief burst of electrical activity typically occurs lasting 300 ms or less, followed by electrical silence [10] . Neuropathic disorders exhibit abnormal spontaneous activity at rest, including fibrillations and positive sharp waves, which arise from spontaneous firing of individual muscle after denervation. In general, muscle is electrically silent in myopathies, but it is important to note that spontaneous activity may occur in certain myopathies due to irritability of the muscle membranes. This occurs particularly in inflammatory, necrotic, or certain congenital myopathies as well as muscular dystrophies [11] . Following assessment of spontaneous activity at rest, muscle is activated minimally so that motor unit action potential (MUAP) morphology including amplitude, duration, and waveform can be assessed, and the muscle power is increased so that recruitment pattern can be assessed. Recruitment is the firing pattern of additional motor units and the rate at which they are activated as the patient increases power of contractions. Recruitment testing is often challenging in the intensive care unit setting (ICU) if patients lack awareness or are unable to participate in incrementally increasing their power of contractions.",

            "text": "In general, neuropathic disorders affect the number of voluntary motor units. When fewer voluntary motor units are available for muscle contraction, muscle recruitment is reduced, and increased effort results in rapid firing of a reduced number of motor units. Since the remaining motor units are larger than normal, the total amplitude of the MUAP and the interference pattern is increased [8] . Myopathic disorders reduce the number of functioning muscle fibers; therefore the force generated by each motor unit is reduced, resulting in MUAPs with lower amplitudes and shorter durations. To generate the same force, more motor units are recruited and motor unit firing rate increases. These differences become more apparent with increased force. Of note, these morphologic changes are not entirely specific as MUAPs with low amplitudes, and short durations can also be seen in early reinnervation after neurogenic injury. The general EMG differences between neuropathic and myopathic disorders are outlined in Fig. 5 .1, but one must note there are exceptions to this simplified table. Given nuances and overlap in electrophysiologic findings, it is important to remember that electrophysiology is only part of the clinical investigation and must be interpreted in the appropriate clinical context to determine disease pattern or arrive at the correct diagnosis.",

Moreover, MRI and ultrasound are increasingly being used to detect and characterize skeletal muscle abnormalities [12] . Like EMG, skeletal muscle MRI can be used to identify targets for muscle biopsy, especially when muscles are not clinically weak, are difficult to test, or appear normal on EMG. MRI signal abnormalities lack specificity, but certain findings can be suggestive of specific conditions, for instance, edema can suggest inflammatory myopathy and fatty infiltration can suggest an underlying disease process causing chronic muscle injury. Location and appearance of muscles that are affected can also help to narrow down the differential diagnosis. For example, atrophy and edema involving the vastus lateralis and medialis with relative sparing of the rectus femoris can help to distinguish inclusion body myositis from other myopathies [13] . If a muscle biopsy is necessary for diagnosis, MRI of the muscles not only helps to identify the optimal site for biopsy but has been shown to reduce overall cost [14] . A modality gaining popularity is ultrasound, as it is noninvasive and inexpensive and provides an assessment of muscle thickness, abnormal movements (e.g., fasciculations), and infiltration by fibrotic tissue or fat, but it lacks the imaging detail offered by MRI.",

Open biopsy allows larger sampling offering the opportunity for more extensive testing due to a larger sample size, but by its open nature is more invasive. The percutaneous approach is less invasive as it involves the use of a needle with a hollow core to obtain multiple small samples; however, the samples are smaller and testing is often limited.

In 1984, a series of five patients were noticed to develop flaccid paralysis with areflexia and difficulty in weaning from the ventilator at the peak of their sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction with neurophysiology indicating development of a new axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy [18] . In 1992, persistent paralysis was observed following long-term neuromuscular blockade but attributed to higher plasma levels of vecuronium metabolites and impaired renal function [19] . Another study reported severe weakness in two critically ill asthmatic patients treated with high-dose steroids and nondepolarizing blocking agents, in whom muscle biopsy demonstrated depletion of thick myosin filaments; they called this acute quadriplegic myopathy and reported their clinical course over several months [20] . Many of these reports did not include detailed neurologic examination or electrophysiological testing, limiting definitive diagnosis at the time. In 1994, in 23 out of 24 critically ill comatose patients with quadriparesis or quadriplegia and diminished deep tendon reflexes (DTR), a landmark study demonstrated evidence of neuropathy, myopathy, or both based on electrophysiology [21] . As this entity was becoming more widely recognized, people began referring to this condition by several names including acute quadriplegic myopathy, acute necrotizing myopathy of intensive care, thick filament myopathy, acute corticosteroid myopathy, acute hydrocortisone myopathy, acute myopathy in severe asthma, and acute corticosteroid and pancuronium-associated myopathy, critical care myopathy, and acute myopathy of intensive care [22] . Physicians were beginning to recognize that these patients may in fact have motor recovery upon recovering from their concurrent critical illness, and the term critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (CINM) was coined [23] .",

Numerous survivors of critical illness suffer from weakness and long-term disability for months to years after discharge from hospital [23, 24] . Diagnosis of CINM is challenging in the ICU due to pre-existing disorders, other active conditions during the stay contributing to muscle weakness, and patient's clinical condition precluding careful neurologic examination. Moreover, many times in the ICU when patients are critically ill, the focus becomes patient survival, and less attention is paid to the gradually progressive neuromuscular weakness from CINM in the background. CINM is a major contributor of ICU-acquired weakness, resulting in chronic disability in survivors of critical illness, and intensivists should be familiar with its diagnosis and clinical course.",

Diaphragmatic weakness, a prominent feature in CINM, has been observed to rapidly develop during mechanical ventilation and is significantly related to the duration of ventilator support [34] . A high catabolic state from systemic inflammation likely contributes to early diaphragmatic weakness in these patients. The strong occurrence of CINM with sepsis and MODS suggests that there are likely shared metabolic, cellular, and microcirculatory pathophysiological mechanisms. Sepsis results in ischemic hypoxia due to widespread impairment in microcirculation [35] as well as impaired mitochondrial function resulting in reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production [36, 37] . Excitable tissue like peripheral nerves and muscle are probably damaged as a result of this microcirculatory failure, resulting in distal axonopathy [38] . In patients with CIP, the expression of E-selectin, a marker of endothelial activation, is increased in vascular endothelium [39] . This could result in increased leukocyte adhesion, local cytokine production, increased microvascular permeability, and endoneurial edema, which could be further worsened by hypoalbuminemia and hyperglycemia. In addition, decreased nutrient supply, increased demand, and decreased clearance of toxic substances and tissue edema can ultimately terminate in bioenergetic failure, neuronal injury, and axonal degeneration. Pathologically in CIN, there is axonal degeneration without inflammation. Other risk factors for CINM include prolonged ICU stay [40] [41] [42] , hyperglycemia [40] , hypoalbuminemia [40] , duration of vasopressor and catecholamine support [41] , hyperosmolarity [42] , parenteral nutrition [42] , and neurologic failure [25, 42] . This data is conflicting for nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers (NMB) and steroids. High corticosteroid levels are thought to increase expression of ubiquitin, leading to increased proteolytic activity [43] . NMBs have been identified as risk factor [25, 42] , but a large study showed that early administration of cisatracurium improved 90-day ARDS patient survival and increased the time off the ventilator without increasing muscle weakness [44] . This finding could be explained by either, the intermediate-effect duration of cisatracurium, or the fact that cisatracurium was only used for 48 hours in the study. It is postulated that nondepolarizing NMBs cause muscle weakness by upregulation of acetylcholine receptors with fetal-type receptors that are less responsive to acetylcholine, presynaptic inhibition of exocytosis of acetylcholine, and potentiation of muscle damage by corticosteroids [45] .",

Neurologic exam reveals normal cranial nerves with generalized flaccid quadriparesis or quadriplegia, often worse distally, usually in conjunction with failure to wean from the ventilator. Hyporeflexia, areflexia, and muscle atrophy can be seen in CIP, though reflexes are usually preserved or hypoactive in CIM.

Treatment of hyperglycemia, early physical rehabilitation, and minimization of sedation have been demonstrated to improve short-term and long-term functional outcomes, increase ventilator-free days, and reduce delirium [54] . Of the factors that may contribute to the development of CINM, many-like the response to sepsis and the incidence of multiorgan failure-are related to the severity of the presenting critical illness and are not easily modifiable. It remains to be demonstrated whether the reduced use of corticosteroids or neuromuscular blocking agents will result in a decreased incidence of CIM. Intensive insulin therapy to maintain strict normoglycemia was shown to reduce the incidence of critical illness polyneuropathy by 49% in a single-center study [41] , but this practice has been shown to increase mortality in patients who are critically ill [55] . Therefore, control of sustained hyperglycemia is reasonable, but aggressive insulin protocols and any hypoglycemic episodes should be avoided [55] . Patients with neuropathy are more prone to pressure palsies, and, thus, great care must be taken in positioning and support to avoid this complication. Neurotoxic medications should also be avoided. In patients that are unable to participate in active strengthening exercises, early physical therapy should be directed toward prevention of muscle atrophy and contractures, as studies have shown that repeated daily passive mobilization prevents muscle atrophy observed by serial muscle biopsies [56] . Early rehabilitation in the ICU requires a cultural shift and a strong commitment from a multidisciplinary team but improves functional outcome [54] .",

Patients with severe CINM have slow and often incomplete recovery, and nearly a third of patients with CINM do not recover spontaneous ventilation or independent walking [25] . Patients with CINM who fail to show clinical improvement in strength can be evaluated with repeat electrophysiologic testing. Patients with evidence of severe axonal loss, with small or absent responses to nerve stimulation and abundant positive waves and fibrillations on needle EMG, will recover slowly if at all and are likely to have residual deficits-sometimes severe [40, 48] .

Skeletal muscle regeneration is reliant on stem (satellite); this is supported by human evidence that shows that decreased satellite cell content impedes muscle growth and results in protracted muscle wasting [58] . Emerging evidence shows that impairment of satellite cells leads to inefficient muscle regeneration and engrafting mesenchymal stem cells restores metabolic and mitochondrial function of satellite cells, improving muscle strength in a mice model [59] . An experimental ICU porcine model study that reproduced ICU conditions such as sedation, long-term mechanical ventilation, and muscle unloading showed that mechanical silencing is a dominant factor triggering the preferential loss of myosin and muscle atrophy in a period of within 6 h to 14 days [60] . In a later study, the same authors attempted to identify gene signatures and molecular pathways that regulate mechanical activation of skeletal muscle affected in the ICU; they found that mechanical silencing triggers genes that regulate mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy as well as ubiquitin ligases Fbxo31 and SMART, which are all reversed by passive mechanical loading [61] . This may explain the beneficial effects of early mobilization and physical therapy in CINM. CINM continues to be an area of active research and discovery, and it is our hope that we will have better understanding and be able to tailor therapy accordingly in the future.",

The majority of patients (about 80%) have generalized MG, but in 20% of cases, the muscle weakness can be limited to ocular muscles such as the levator palpebrae, and this subtype is known as ocular MG [81] . This muscle weakness is asymmetric and results in double vision and ptosis, which can be transient or fluctuate throughout the day. Nearly 50-80% of patients who primarily present with symptoms limited to ocular muscles develop systemic MG within 2 years of initial presentation (secondary generalized MG); therefore, it is reasonable to postpone the diagnosis of ocular MG for 2 years after initial presentation given the high rate of developing SGMG [82] [83] [84] .",

RNS evaluates the safety factor which is the number of acetylcholine receptors on the post synaptic junction that is required to form an adequate endplate potential causing membrane depolarization and muscle contraction. In MG, there are not enough acetylcholine receptors available, and the safety factor is decreased. A decrement of more than 10% in CMAP amplitude is seen after slow repetitive stimulation and is more pronounced between the first and second stimuli. RNS usually is done on distal muscles first, but if the results are negative, proximal muscles like trapezius or nasalis muscles and in cases of ocular myasthenia, the orbicularis oculi muscle should be tested. It is important to remember that RNS should not be performed near a pacemaker or indwelling central venous catheter, and all anticholinergic medications should to be discontinued for 12 h prior to edrophonium testing [8] .",

            "text": "\u2022 Azathioprine (AZA): is the first-line agent in this group for treatment of MG [100] . AZA derivative, 6-mercaptopurine, acts by prohibiting activation and proliferation of B cells and T cells in the body leading to its immunosuppressant effect. The starting dose is 2-3 mg/ day/kg, which can later be decreased to as low as 1 mg/day/kg bodyweight if the patient's clinical symptoms have been stabilized or remission has been achieved. Treatment effects of AZA will be seen months after initiation of therapy [101] . AZA in combination with steroids can lead to lower doses of steroids required, more effective treatments, and less side effects [102] although in 10-20% of patients who are resistant to therapy, higher doses of steroids may be required despite use of AZA. AZA treatment should not be abruptly discontinued since it can cause recurrence of MG symptoms and at times MG crisis [103, 104] . Side effects seen in patients treated with AZA are increased MCV, reversible lymphopenia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [105] . At times, AZA dose can be decreased by 25% with addition allopurinol that prevents AZA metabolization and hence decreases the myelotoxic side effects of AZA [94] . \u2022 Ciclosporin a (CSA): has been proven to be effective in treatment of MG in one placebocontrolled trial [106] . The initial dose is 3-4 mg/day/kg in two single doses and in conjunction with steroids. This dose can later be reduced to 2-2.5 mg/day/kg as the patient's disease stabilizes. Ciclosporin compared to AZA has a more rapid clinical affect, usually within 4-6 weeks, but it also has worst side effect profile with myelosuppression, opportunistic infections, and nephrotoxicity leading to hyperkalemia. It can decrease seizure threshold and cause reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome [ [109] [110] [111] . Although there were two studies that did not show any superiority to prednisone [112] and no steroid-sparing benefit in 9 months [113] , it was thought that a 9-month follow-up period was not long enough to evaluate the efficacy of MMF since the clinical effects of the medication take a long time to be seen. \u2022 Tacrolimus (TCM): like ciclosporin A, works by inhibiting calcineurin and lymphocyte activation. However, it is 10-100 times stronger than CSA and causes the same side effects. It has been shown that TCM in doses of 3-5 mg/ day can be beneficial for treatment of patients with MG [114] [115] [116] [117] . In one cohort study of 79 patients with MG, the effects of TCM was compared to the combination of CSA and prednisone which showed symptom stabilization and decreasing levels of AchR antibodies [118, 119] . Drug's blood level should be monitored for nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity side effects. \u2022 Rituximab: is an antiCD20 monoclonal antibody, which causes immunosuppression by decreasing the number B lymphocytes in circulation. A recent metanalysis, published in 2015, looking at 15 studies and 168 patients, showed a response rate of 83.9% to rituximab. The patients in these studies were either positive for AchR antibodies or MuSK antibodies or were negative for both of these antibodies. The rituximab dose used in these 15 studies was also different. This metanalysis showed that patients with positive MuSK antibodies had a better response to rituximab treatment compared to the rest of the patients [120] . This was thought to be secondary to the fact that IgG4 antibodies in MuSKpositive patient were made by CD20+ plasma cells in blood that are more affected by rituximab [121, 122] . \u2022 Cyclophosphamide (CPP): can be used in cases of severe MG that has not responded to standard treatments or those who require frequent plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption [123] . It can be administered as pulse therapy with 500 mg/m 2 body surface area every 4 weeks [124] or immunoablative therapy with 50 mg/day/kg for 4 consecutive days [123, 125] . The latter dose should be followed by GCSF or stem cell transplantation [125, 126] .",

IVIG is pooled immunoglobulin from donors. Mechanism for IVIG in MG is unclear. IVIG can be administered as 0.4 g/day/kg in 5 days or 1 g/day/kg in 2 days [127, 128] . IVIG has been shown to be as effective as plasmapheresis in resolution of MG crisis and to decrease the time required for mechanical ventilation [129] . Side effects of IVIG include headache, hypertension, pulmonary edema, heart failure exacerbation secondary to volume overload, thrombotic and thromboembolic events like venous thrombosis, strokes and myocardial infarctions, infections, aseptic meningitis, and anaphylactic reaction especially in patients with IgA deficiency [130] .",

Of patients with positive AchR antibody and no thymoma on the CT or MRI, 60-70% have hyperplasia [137, 138] . A MG treatment trial published in 2016 randomized 126 patients with generalized MG, positive AchR antibody and disease duration of less than 5 years to thymectomy, and alternate-day prednisone alone over 3 years. Patients who underwent a thymectomy had lower quantitative MG score, lower requirements for alternate-day prednisone, lower requirements for immunosuppression, lower rates of MG exacerbation and hospitalization, and higher improvement in clinical status, indicative of beneficial clinical outcome in non-thymomatous patients who underwent thymectomy [139] .",

In demyelinating form of GBS, findings are increased F wave latency, prolonged distal motor latency, conduction block, and temporal dispersion, while sensory nerve potentials are normal [175] . In axonal forms, NCS shows decreased motor or sensory amplitudes based on the nerves involved. If it is a mixed motor and sensory form, a decrease in both amplitudes will be seen. At times, there may be a transient conduction block, secondary to involvement of nodes of Ranvier in these neurons [176] . This transient conduction block can cause confusion in differentiating between demyelinating form and axonal form; however since it is reversible in the axonal variant, repeating NCS later in the course of the disease can help differentiate the two [177] .",

Patients with neck flexion weakness usually have associated diaphragmatic weakness. Vital capacity can be evaluated by asking the patient to count from 1 to 20 in one single breath. Facial muscles, gag and cough reflex, and tongue strength should be checked which helps evaluate patient's ability to maintain airway and manage secretions.

All patients with signs of impending respiratory failure should be admitted to an ICU for close monitoring with continuous pulse oximetry. Chest X-ray (CXR) is necessary to identify underlying pulmonary diseases like pneumonia or pulmonary edema which can trigger respiratory failure or worsen respiratory function. Arterial blood gas (ABG) can provide information regarding oxygenation and ventilation by measuring PaO 2 and PaCO 2 , respectively. Worsening of respiratory failure and need for invasive ventilation should be monitored by bedside assessment of forced vital capacity (FVC), maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP)/negative inspiratory force (NIF), and maximum expiratory pressure (MEP). FVC of less than 20 ml/kg or a 30% decline or more over 24 h and MIP of less than \u221230 cm H 2 O or MEP of less than 40 cm H 2 O are indicators of impending respiratory failure requiring intubation [197] . However, one must remember that these tests are effort dependent, can be falsely low if patient is fatigued, and requires that patient receive proper instructions prior to their performance. Moreover, in patients with facial muscle weakness, providing a good seal around the spirometer can be difficult and result in erroneous measurements. It is preferred that these measurements are taken in the same body position every time since FVC and MIP are higher when the patient is in upright position compared to supine position. A decrease of more than 20% in FVC from upright to supine position is indicative of diaphragm weakness.",

As patients become more fatigued, they develop alveolar hypoventilation, which is evident by continued and worsening tachypnea, normal PCO 2 , and slightly low levels of PaO 2 on ABG. In later stage of respiratory failure with worsening muscular weakness and increasing fatigue, alveoli start to collapse resulting in severe hypoxemia and hypercapnia [194] . These signs and symptoms should alert the physicians to an impending respiratory failure and consideration of mechanical ventilatory support. Modes of ventilation support can be divided into noninvasive ventilation (NIV) such as CPAP and BiPAP or invasive ventilation, i.e., intubation. Noninvasive modes of ventilation can be beneficial in acute setting in ICU or ED or in late stages of progressive NMDs as seen in ALS. It is of utmost importance that patient's cardiopulmonary comorbidities, mental status, and secretion are evaluated prior to administration of NIV.",

BiPAP is a great option for patients with respiratory failure secondary to neuromuscular weakness, since it provides positive airway pressure during inspiration and expiration with oxygen flow that helps improve oxygenation and ventilation [198] . It is important to keep in mind that patients with neuromuscular weakness mostly breathe through their mouth so the mask used in noninvasive ventilation should cover both the nose and mouth [194] . One caveat to use of noninvasive mode of ventilation is in patients with bulbar weakness that may be having difficulty in managing their secretions-using positive airway pressure can increase their chances of aspiration.",

The cytoskeleton of the muscle membrane is abnormal in patients with NMDs, and life-threatening amounts of intracellular potassium can be released after exposure to succinylcholine and volatile agents. Total intravenous anesthesia based on short-acting opioids, propofol, and dexmedetomidine should be a firstline option, considering their cardiac depressant effects.",

            "text": "Most patients with neuromuscular disorders are diagnosed and treated in the outpatient clinic; however a small but significant subset of these patients can present with a rapidly advancing muscle weakness which can be a life-threatening emergency. The most significant compromise occurs in respiratory function needing mechanical ventilation although monitoring of cardiac function, hemodynamics, and bulbar function is also sometimes warranted. A thorough history and physical examination along with prudent intensive care management has the potential to mitigate morbidity and mortality. With the increased availability of therapies such as immunoglobulins, plasma exchange, steroid-sparing agents, immunomodulatory therapy, as well as specialized care in neurointensive care units, physicians today have a range of therapies to offer.",
