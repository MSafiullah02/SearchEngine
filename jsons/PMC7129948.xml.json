HTS was performed on individual CSF and brain specimens in 129 and 21 patients, respectively. CSF samples of 162 patients were pooled for HTS analysis [26], [27], [28]. HTS was performed on CSF and brain specimens in five patients [26], [29], [30], [31], [32]. Positive results on both samples were obtained in a Cache Valley virus chronic meningoencephalitis case [30] and positive results on brain biopsies only were reported in two human astrovirus (HAstV)-VA1 and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) cases [29], [33]. In one patient, HTS analysis did not identify a viral cause, but Balamuthia mandrillaris was identified in both CSF and brain biopsy [32]. Despite limitations because of publication bias, the overall diagnostic yield for a viral aetiology according to sample type was estimated to be higher for brain specimens (16/21 (76.2%) positive samples) than for CSF samples (26/291 (8.9%) positive samples).",

Fig. 2\nshows the distribution of viruses identified according to patient immune status and clinical manifestations. HTS allowed the identification of viruses previously unknown or unexpected as a cause of CNS infection (n = 10) and thus not screened during diagnostic investigations (Table 1). These included parvovirus 4 (two) [46], human coronavirus OC43 (one) [25], and novel HAstV-MLB2 (one) [22] identified in immunocompetent patients. A mumps virus vaccine strain (one) [41], HAstV (undetermined specie; one) [47], HAstV-VA1 (four) [23], [31], [33], [43], and HAstV-MLB1 (one) [24] were identified in immunocompromised patients. A gemycircularvirus was also identified, but its causal role in encephalitis is under debate [27]. Three novel viral species or strains were identified in CSF samples of patients with encephalitis (Table 1): human CSF-associated densovirus 1 (HuCSFDV1) [37]; cyclovirus Viet-Nam (CyCV-VN) [28]; and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-related arenavirus [26]. HTS analysis also identified viruses known to be responsible for CNS infections (n = 11) and not screened or detected by routine assays (HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), TBEV, WNV, Cache Valley, Saint Louis encephalitis, Toscana, mumps, measles, and coxsackie A9 virus) [29], [30], [34], [35], [39], [40], [42], [48], [49] (Table 1).",

Based on the studies retrieved, its diagnostic yield for a viral aetiology is difficult to estimate, particularly because of publication bias (high number of case reports), methodological heterogeneity, and a lack of systematic prospective studies. When focusing specifically on case series, the diagnostic yield for the identification of a viral cause was approximately 10%, but this result should be interpreted with caution in the light of the evolution of the technique from 2008 to 2017. Among the studies reviewed, the HTS contribution is evident not only for the identification of a potential causal virus in CNS infections of unknown origin, but also in the detection of novel or divergent viruses [26], [28], [37]. Similar to other techniques, the type of sample used for analysis is of particular importance. Despite diverse HTS protocols and publication bias, HTS seemed to have a higher diagnostic yield in brain specimens than in CSF samples. The diagnostic yield was particularly low in two studies where HTS was performed on CSF supernatant [27], [28]. HTS also shows its clinical value in situations where the viral pathogenic mechanisms and specific clinical situations impairs the results of conventional assays [40]. Among immunocompetent patients, HTS led to the identification of viruses not previously associated with CNS infections (parvovirus 4, CyCV-VN, gemycircularvirus, and novel HAstV-MLB2) [22], [27], [28], [46].",

The rapid decision to perform HTS, short HTS turnaround times, and the efficient interpretation of results were determinant for the management of these latter patients. Among immunocompromised patients, HTS contributed to the detection of viruses for which no assay was performed during conventional work-up: viruses known to cause CNS infections (TBEV, WNV, Cache Valley virus, Saint-Louis encephalitis virus, EBV) [29], [30], [39], [40], [42], viruses not known to be responsible for CNS infections (novel HAstV-VA1, HAstV-MLB1, human coronavirus OC43, mumps virus vaccine strain) [23], [24], [25], [31], [33], [41], [43], [47], and novel viruses (LCMV-related arenavirus) [26]. Focusing on novel HAstV, HTS brought new insights in our understanding of their association with CNS infections [22], [23], [24], [31], [33], [43].

The use of positive controls as quality controls was only reported in seven studies [31], [33], [34], [35], [38], [48], [50]. Addressing the issue of contamination, only a few studies reported the use of negative controls [30], [32], [34], [35], [38], [40], [44], [45], [50]. Viral sequences assigned to viruses not considered as the cause of CNS infection were not consistently performed: 12 studies provided a description for one CNS sample or more [25], [27], [29], [30], [32], [33], [34], [35], [38], [40], [44], [50]. For most of these viral sequences, no interpretation of results was explicitly provided. Among reads of viruses known to cause infections in humans, Anelloviridae [51] and Herpesviridae were the most described in four and seven samples, respectively; human pegivirus reads were identified in one sample. The genome of the torque teno virus, a member of the Anelloviridae family, and human pegivirus have been identified in CNS samples, but without any association with a CNS disease so far [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57]. Other viral sequences were mostly assigned to viruses infecting plants or non-vertebrates and were considered to be reagent contaminants. The minimal description of these HTS \u2018background\u2019 results impairs the comprehension of the composition of the CNS virome. Furthermore, the integration of HTS results in the clinical context is of particular importance and the absence of standardization of any reporting methods precludes an objective interpretation of these results.",

From a technical point of view, it should be considered that this narrative review includes studies from 2008 to 2018 and thus takes into account the tremendous evolution of the HTS technique over this last decade. Several technical issues need to be considered for the interpretation of negative results: pre-analytic steps (e.g. the use of fresh, frozen, or paraffin-embedded samples for analysis, extraction protocols, fragmentation methods, library preparation, paired-end versus single-end protocols); sequencing depth; sequencing platforms (Table 1); and the analysis of HTS raw data (e.g. mapping software, viral databases, and pipeline precision).",

Considering the selection and publication bias of the literature reviewed here, the negative predictive value for the aetiologic identification of viral encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, and meningitis is difficult to quantify and further studies are needed. HTS needs to be integrated in clinical management as a second-line technique or in parallel to first-line investigations when a standard work-up according to guidelines [8], [58] and additional investigations considering local epidemiology and specific clinical situations fail to identify a causal agent. Brain biopsy should also be considered. Furthermore, HTS is of particular interest for the screening of a large panel of viruses, particularly to avoid a restricted screening of low-volume clinical samples, such as in paediatric patients. HTS brought new perspectives to the investigations of infectious diseases. Notably, its unbiased approach is of particular interest in samples that would not usually be tested in specific syndromes. Its use may not only be restricted to CNS samples, but also extended to other clinical samples. This is illustrated by the positive results of (RT)-PCR assays performed on blood or plasma samples collected at the time of neurological manifestations, which allowed the identification of the same virus detected by HTS in CNS samples (parvovirus 4, LCMV-related arenavirus, novel HAstV-VA1, novel HAstV-MLB2) [22], [26], [31], [46]. This could be of particular interest when a cerebral biopsy cannot be performed and a disseminated infection occurs or is suspected, particularly in immunocompromised patients.",

Most studies confirmed HTS results with (RT)-PCR assays and a few with cell culture, serological assays, and immunohistochemistry. Thus, HTS should be implemented in clinical routine in association with other diagnostic tests. In most studies, the approach to establish causality was not explicitly described, but was reported as the temporal association of clinical manifestations and the identification of viral sequences of a specific virus using HTS on CNS samples at the time of manifestations. This process was only described in few studies. Similar to other molecular tests such as (RT)-PCR, the detection of viral sequences or genome in a clinical sample should be interpreted with caution in the clinical context. In a near future, the process for the establishment of causality in HTS analysis should be more transparent and should comprise multidisciplinary sessions involving infectious disease specialists and bioinformatics experts, not only for results concerning viruses unexpected to cause CNS infections. Finally, for HTS implementation in clinical routine, the question of standardization has to be addressed concerning HTS protocols, data analysis algorithms, reference databases and quality controls, and further prospective studies are needed [60].",

This unbiased or semi-unbiased approach led to the identification of novel viruses, viruses known or not expected to cause CNS infections. Standardized strategies are needed for the further implementation of HTS in clinical management. In centres where available, the decision to perform HTS should be considered early in the management of encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, and meningitis in as a second-line technique or in parallel to recommended investigations.",
