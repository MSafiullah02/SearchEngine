The range of hosts of retroviruses is narrow, and HIV can be acquired only from humans although HTLV and SFV are from suspected zoonotic origin and intraspecies transmission to humans after first infection in nonhuman primates.3\n,\n4 Of the human genome, 5-8% are endogenous retroviruses derived from viral sequences with similarity to the infectious retroviruses. Understanding the endogenous retroviruses is clinically important because the accumulation of viral sequences has created the current human genome, and it can cause diseases associated with endogenous retroviruses.",

In MS patients, it has been reported that expression or abnormal representation of HERV-H, -K and -W and a polymorphism in HERV-Fc1 occurs.23 Secretion of env proteins coded by HERV-W in oligodendroglial precursor cells reduces oligodendroglial differentiation via activation of Toll-like receptor, and blocking their differentiation results in demyelinated and degenerating axons.24 HERV env proteins are related to complex pathological disorders and can be one of the targets for therapeutic approach.25 A monoclonal antibody against a HERV-W env protein is under clinical trial as a therapeutic approach for MS.26\n,\n27\n",

It was previously believed that only retroviruses can integrate into the host genome, but Horie et al showed that sequences derived from nonretroviral RNA exist in the human genome. Bornaviruses, negative sense single stranded RNA viruses, encode 6 genes (M, X, P, N, G and L), and 2 proteins with high similarity to N genes, called endogenous borna-like N -1 and -2, have been found.43 It is believed that N genes of bornaviruses integrated by RT activation of long interspersed nuclear element, and this mechanism can enhance the integration of any viruses without dependence on retroviruses.43 The mechanism is the same as a system of making a processed gene, which was the evolutionary force to increase a member of a gene family in the human evolution.44 If the activation of long interspersed nuclear element enhances the integration of any viruses, there should be many more known and unknown viruses in the human genome. Whole genome sequencing of viruses and infected hosts will help to discover new viral sequences in the human genome, and the number of viral sequences in the genome could be higher than the current estimation based on the sequence similarity of only retroviruses (5-8%). Most viruses can infect specific tissues or cells in the human body, and it is not clear how a virus can recognize specific cells and invade cells. If there is affinity between the virus and cells, the virus might tend to get into the genome of specific cells with high affinity. If there is a niche in the localization of the virus, the niche might allow an entry route of the virus and thereby determine integration.",
