Academic leaders, who remain authentic, will be able to motivate faculty of the ambivalent majority, previously resistant to any form of technology\u2010enhanced teaching to attend these workshops. Nonetheless, many in academia are in uncharted territory; faculty, staff, and students, now working remotely are stressed, uncertain and even afraid in their new reality with their well\u2010established teaching and learning routines disrupted. Empathy, compassion, and flexibility are in order, and appropriate leader behaviors matched to the context of crisis management in academia will be crucial (Doraiswamy, 2012).",

Although some faculty, driven by their intrinsic willingness to innovate, has quickly developed serviceable online course offerings, academic leadership should manage faculty expectations. These hastily assembled online course offerings cannot all be perfect, and some may even be mediocre. However, those academic leaders capable of leveraging the skills and talents of the campus collective, by wielding a distributed situational leadership style (Harris, 2010) will allow faculty to perform at high levels. A distributed leadership style encourages collaboration and inclusivity, and according to long\u2010established leadership theory (Kerr & Jermier, 1978) works well in academia where followers are experienced, knowledgeable and intrinsically motivated. Faculty may be capable of building better quality online course offerings that establish a community of learners capable of working together to overcome the teaching and learning challenges posed by the current coronavirus crisis, when leadership is decentralized. These courses will leverage various digital learning technologies to promote interaction, the key to effective online learning and ironically the antithesis of social distancing.",

It is a time for academic leaders courageous enough to disrupt longstanding patterns of behavior, to challenge opinions and organizational norms, and disrupt the status quo. These leaders can successfully navigate the transition to remote learning with flexibility, understanding, and compassion. Looking forward, once the current crisis is over, and it will end, since the present disruption is only temporary, academic leaders will be presented with a dilemma as they rebuild. What to do with these makeshift online course offerings, rolled out in an emergency to get through the semester? Will they be refined and sustained in a new reshaped reality or discarded as a used band\u2010aid? Academic leaders with the adaptive capacity (Heifetz & Laurie, 2001) to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they arise may now redefine organizational responsibilities by disruptive innovation and employ digital technologies to alter or eliminate inefficient legacy practices. Perhaps the digital resources produced in response to the crisis may be employed to assist disadvantaged students, those with physical and learning disabilities or in vocational course design for non\u2010traditional students returning to education once the crisis subsides.",

            "text": "The attributes of an effective academic leader when facing adaptive challenges have been previously described (Fernandez & Shaw, 2020); they include but are not limited to accountability, trustworthiness, and integrity. However, in a crisis, perhaps the most important of all is emotional intelligence and emotional stability that will allow the academic leader to place the interests of others above their own in servant leadership (Doraiswamy, 2012). Servant leadership that emphasizes empowerment, involvement, and collaboration is a particularly effective form of leadership in faith\u2010based schools, colleges, and universities (Wheeler, 2012) and it is a leadership style that becomes more critical in a crisis (Doraiswamy, 2012). Faced with the present novel coronavirus pandemic, academic leaders had to quickly overcome any lingering normalcy bias that they may have harbored, and quickly assess their current reality in which students, faculty, and staff are experiencing genuine difficulties in their everyday life. Following Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, faculty, staff, and students at Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana experienced considerable disruption to their daily routines in the aftermath of the storm. In their response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, leadership at Tulane was determined to focus on the welfare and safety of their faculty, staff, and students as their top priority, as they also transitioned to remote teaching and learning, and shut down campuses (Cowen, 2020).",

Those academic leaders who are humble, considerate, and intuitive can best regulate the stress on all stakeholders, and in return, they will receive the full support of these stakeholders during the crisis and beyond. A leader's tough empathy (Goffee & Jones, 2000) is also important in a crisis and by offering both personal and professional support on a human level; academic leaders can maintain institutional morale through the crisis.",

            "text": "Leaders at all levels of an institution must act with deliberate calm (Garcia, 2006), courage, and humility in a crisis to strengthen relationships with individuals both within and outside of the institution. On campuses where there can be a culture of mutual distrust and a divide between faculty and administration, now is the time to set distrust aside (Dever & Justice, 2020) and leverage the benefits of genuine shared governance. Academic leaders on senate committees with oversight of distance learning and information technology initiatives can profitably engage with campus administration to the benefit of the student population. Academic leaders can build relationships by inquiring, advocating, and connecting (Ancona, Malone, Orlikowski, & Senge, 2007) with individuals as people first, to gain their perspectives while leveraging the many benefits of diversity and establishing a mutual trust. Without mutual trust, there can be no transformative change. Some academic leaders may even use the crisis as a catalyst to re\u2010establish dormant relationships, and reach out to establish new relationships with those who hold contrary views, those from the ambivalent majority, as well as those considered confidants, who can often provide a genuine reality check for the academic leader. Making connections with people at all levels of the institution during a crisis, allows the leader to be truly transformative and the collaboration to be meaningful (Fernandez & Shaw, 2020).",

In a crisis, leaders may be called upon to resolve interpersonal and task\u2010related conflicts as they arise, though they should encourage healthy debate and conflict as appropriate, providing that it is functional (Robbins & Judge, 2018). Investing in relationships during a crisis will strengthen the bond between students, faculty, and staff and the institution; an investment that will be repaid in full, once the crisis passes, since relationships forged in a crisis by meaningful engagement can become long\u2010term and consequential when the crisis subsides (Kezar et al., 2018).",

Therefore, the leader should be initially responsible for identifying the impending crisis as such, and setting institutional priorities before leveraging the collective knowledge of the campus community. Once these institutional priorities have been established, these leaders (Kezar & Holcombe, 2017) should delegate leadership responsibilities to a network of multi\u2010disciplinary teams or task forces that will have a significant role in the implementation of the crisis management strategy. Ideally, an academic leader would select team members based not only on member skills, but on their character traits. The big five character traits of conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness are generally preferred in team members (John & Srivastava, 1999). Additionally, the academic leader may consider diversity and cultural differences in team construction.",

            "text": "Distributing leadership responsibilities is more effective than other leadership approaches in a crisis (Berjaoui & Karami\u2010Akkary, 2019) and it will improve the quality of the decisions made since multiple perspectives can be obtained, particularly if each team is autonomous, self\u2010managed, and empowered to make decisions (Kezar & Holcombe, 2017). By distributing leadership responsibilities, the teams remain motivated and incentivized since they have more latitude in problem solving than would be the case on a campus operating a top\u2010down leadership model. Provided with adequate resources, these teams should be allowed to operate in a climate of trust, established throughout the institution in a crisis, and engage in problem solving, innovation and change. Because of the nature of the current crisis, these teams operate virtually, at a distance from the main campus, employing a variety of technologies to connect physically dispersed team members. A remote working model allows teams to be constructed based on the skills and abilities of the team members rather than on geographical proximity (Robbins & Judge, 2018). The ability of teams to successfully accomplish their role is related to their distributed situational awareness (Sorensen & Stanton, 2013), and thus the leader must trust these teams to address the crisis with a moral purpose and implement solutions. Academic leaders should avoid micromanaging these teams that will utilize a shared leadership model to pursue a common purpose; to maintain a quality student learning experience throughout the crisis without disruption. Having formed a network of teams in response to the crisis, these teams can work toward a response; they may refocus as appropriate and disband with crisis resolution. Upon crisis resolution, teams can disband with a sense of accomplishment haven risen to the challenges presented by the crisis and their work may, in fact, yield tangible long\u2010term benefits.",

            "text": "Leaders should communicate clearly and frequently to all stakeholders in a crisis (Edmondson, 2020), though they should be cognizant that it is not only the message communicated to stakeholders that is important but also the medium by which it is delivered. Communication media vary in their richness, and when the information is important as it is in the current crisis, more than one communication channel should be used (Robbins & Judge, 2018). In the current crisis, unable to communicate face\u2010to\u2010face because of social distancing practices, leaders should consider the live streaming of updates or messages of encouragement to stakeholders. The choice of communication channel selected by leadership should also consider stakeholder preferences and thus communication with employees and students may utilize different channels. Faculty and staff may prefer updates from leadership through email, while students, many of whom are millennials, may prefer to receive their updates through a variety of social medium platforms (or text message), relatively lean communication channels. Following Hurricane Katrina, Tulane leadership utilized a variety of messaging tools, apps, and social media to communicate with all stakeholders to build a sense of community, belonging and trust and reduce anxiety (Cowen, 2020). All communications from Tulane leadership in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina balanced reality with hope and empathy, while looking for silver linings in the crisis (Cowen, 2020). In response to the current coronavirus pandemic, Rice University is now crafting messages centrally, to ensure consistency, while customizing them for specific audiences (Field, 2020). Communication in a crisis is a delicate balancing act; too much and the message is tuned out, too little may prompt concern and anxiety (Field, 2020).",

Those academic leaders able to communicate a compelling and thoughtful shared vision for the institution that is realistic and attainable once the crisis dissipates can inspire faculty, staff, and students. The process of communicating a compelling vision of the future has been described as visioning, and it is a dynamic and collaborative process (Ancona et al., 2007). The leader's articulated strategic vision should be aligned with organizational goals and consistent with the institutional mission to reassure all stakeholders that they are following the situation, and have a strategy in place for crisis resolution. Leaders must communicate how strategy establishes the mission and vision of the institution and execute on the strategy with resolve, adjusting appropriately as more information and the effect of their actions become known. There should be a transparency to the actions of the academic leader in a crisis so that the campus community is clear on the direction the institution is heading.",

There is no such thing as a complete academic leader (Ancona et al., 2007), but those leaders with the flexibility and adaptive capacity to learn and evolve as a consequence of navigating a crisis, will be able to respond more effectively and with less effort to future challenges and may just be the ideal \u201callostatic leader\u201d for our academic institutions looking forward (Yarnell & Grunberg, 2017, p. 36). The ability of a leader to learn and evolve from facing significant crucibles is an essential component of effective leadership (Kezar, Carducci, & Contreras\u2010McGavin, 2006). By committing to these leadership best practices, academic leaders will emerge from the crisis to rebuild, with their credibility and brand untarnished and perhaps even enhanced.",
