One or several virus-encoded glycoproteins are inserted into the envelope. These proteins are exposed at the virion surface and are responsible therefore of the initial interactions of the virus with the target cell, leading to \u201cvirus entry\u201d. In fact, it is only the cargo inside the envelope layer and not the virus itself what is actually discharged inside the cell. The virus glycoproteins are also the main targets of the neutralizing antibody response produced by the host in its defense against the virus.",

Virus-cell fusion is therefore the step at which the virus particle loses its individuality. Membrane fusion may proceed at the cell surface or alternatively after internalization of the virus particle, generally by endocytosis. In either case, fusion is driven by specialized viral glycoproteins (fusogens) which are activated (triggered) by specific events occurring either at the cell surface or inside the endosome. The viral fusogens are in metastable conformations in the virus particle. Once triggered, they initiate a series of conformational changes (in most cases irreversibly) that facilitate approximation of the two membranes, followed by fusion. At the end of the fusion process, the viral fusogens adopt highly stable conformations. The free energy liberated during the transition from the metastable pre-fusion to the highly stable post-fusion conformation drives the fusion process.",

Most important among them are: (i) hydrophobic effects that seek to minimize solvent-exposed apolar surfaces, (ii) elastic forces that prevent monolayer deformation and (iii) electrostatic repulsions between negatively charged phospholipids. Nevertheless, fusion between protein-free lipid bilayers (e.g., liposomes) can be induced under certain conditions. For instance, certain phospholipids (e.g., phosphatidylcholine, PC) induce positive curvature of the lipid monolayer whereas others (e.g., phosphatidylethanolamine, PE) induce negative curvature. The distribution of PC and PE between the two leaflets of the lipid bilayer can either promote or inhibit spontaneous protein-free membrane fusion. Also direct dehydration between bilayers promotes fusion by bringing the two membranes into very close contact. However, under most physiological conditions, specialized proteins are needed to overcome the repulsive forces that prevent membrane fusion.",

This stalk is then expanded forming what is called the hemifusion diaphragm, in which lipids of the two distal leaflets of the bilayers are now in direct contact. Finally, rupture of the hemifusion diaphragm leads to formation of the fusion pore that is then expanded to complete membrane fusion and content mixing of the two compartments. However, opening of the fusion pore may be a reversible step and does not always lead to full fusion [3]. Energy is therefore required through all steps of the fusion process, including expansion of the fusion pore. Hence, proteins when present must operate from the initial stages of membrane deformation to final merging of the two membranes.\n",

In this case, influenza HA also mediates the initial interaction of the virus with sialic acid of glycoproteins or glycolipids at the cell surface (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_15).

Formation of the pre-hairpin intermediate involves very large-scale structural rearrangements in the viral fusogens with exposure of hydrophobic segments or loops (the fusion peptide, FP). Since the hydrophobic fusion peptide cannot be exposed to a hydrophilic environment it inserts into the target membrane. At this point the viral and target membranes are bridged by two separate segments of the same polypeptide; one is the fusion peptide bound to the target membrane and the other is the transmembrane (TM) region of the viral fusogen inserted into the viral membrane. The pre-hairpin intermediate may have a relatively long half-life; for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gp41 protein, the half-life seems to be several minutes [5], but in other cases, it may only be a few seconds [6]. The pre-hairpin bridge then collapses bringing into close apposition the viral and target membranes, which are distorted probably into protein-free nipple-like configurations (Fig. 16.1b, \u201ccollapse of intermediate\u201d). This is followed by the formation of a lipid stalk and a hemifusion diaphragm (in analogy with the protein-free membrane fusion path), which allows lipid mixing between the two proximal leaflets of the viral and target membranes. Finally, the hemifusion diaphragm opens to form a transient fusion pore that may flicker open and closed until it expands [7], leaving the viral fusogen in a highly stable post-fusion hairpin conformation inserted into the target membrane (Fig. 16.1b, \u201cpost-fusion\u201d).",

However, a brief pulse at low pH (middle panel) exposes the fusion peptide of the influenza HA which is then inserted into the membrane of multiple liposomes. Longer pulses of low pH result in fusion of the virus with multiple liposomes leading to formation of large vesicles (lower panel; note two vesicles, one small and one large, caught in the process of fusion).",

It is estimated that 4\u20136 HA molecules are required for fusion, forming a protein ring at the periphery of the fusion pore.

A free energy of roughly this magnitude could be recovered from the collapse of one or two pre-hairpin intermediates, depending on the interactions driving such collapse. In fact, experiments with HIV suggest that only one or two active envelope glycoproteins are sufficient for fusion [10], although later estimates have increased this number [11]. It may be that the fusion proteins of HIV and other retroviruses have evolved to manage with a single fusion protein, as the number of envelope glycoproteins in the virus particle (estimated 15\u201320, in contrast to hundreds in other viruses) is rather sparse.",

Zippering together of these two domains brings the membranes into close proximity. Dehydration of the initial contact site induces monolayer rupture resulting in lipid stalk formation and hemifusion. However, formation of the fusion pore requires further structural rearrangements, including interactions between regions adjacent to the fusion peptide and the transmembrane region [12, 13] and, probably, additional contacts between these two hydrophobic regions that are now inserted into the same membrane.

In contrast, the proteins involved in vesicle fusion and cell-cell fusion are initially inserted in the two membranes predestined to fuse (Fig. 16.1c). In synaptic vesicles, the main proteins responsible of membrane fusion are the so-called SNARE (soluble N-ethylamine sensitive factor attachment receptor protein) proteins [18] which share a conserved 60\u201370 amino acid motif. These proteins, when they find each other refold into a highly stable four-helix parallel coiled-coil bundle that resembles the six-helix bundle formed by the heptad repeats (structural motifs with a repeating pattern of seven amino acids) of certain viral fusogens (see below). Formation of the four-helix bundle leads to membrane apposition and hemifusion, as with the collapse of the pre-hairpin intermediate of viral fusogens. However, a unique characteristic of vesicle fusion is that the protein machinery involved in the process is disassembled, once fusion is finished to be reused in subsequent fusion events. This is accomplished by the ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase) N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF) [19].",

Comparison with the post-fusion structure of the F ectodomain from other paramyxovirus (for instance respiratory syncytial virus (RSV (Fig. 16.2)) and functional studies using peptide inhibitors [24] provided the following model of membrane fusion: Upon virus binding to cells through the attachment protein, F is activated and initiates a series of conformational changes, including separation of the HRB coils and refolding of HRA sequences to form a very elongated trimeric coiled-coil. The fusion peptides -now at the N-terminus of the HRAs- insert into the target cell membrane, resulting in formation of the pre-hairpin intermediate. This step is followed by zipping of the C-terminal part of the molecule along the core coiled-coil to bring together the two membranes and the fusion and TM domains, in analogy with the process described before for influenza HA. However, in the case of the paramyxovirus F the HRB sequences wrap around the HRA coiled-coil forming an extremely stable six-helix bundle (6HB) in the post-fusion hairpin.

Two alternative models (\u201cclamp\u201d and \u201cprovocateur\u201d) have been proposed to explain the requirement of the attachment protein for fusion:The clamp model postulates that HN (or the equivalent attachment protein depending on the virus) is complexed with F in the virus particle, retaining the latter in the metastable configuration. Conformational changes in HN upon receptor binding release F from the complex to initiate membrane fusion.Alternatively, the provocateur model postulates that HN and F do not interact in the virus before contacting the cell.

Similar structures have now been solved for the E ectodomain of dengue virus types 2 and 3 [9]. The polypeptide chain of the E protein follows a complex path, resulting in three globular domains, essentially constituted by \u03b2-sheets (Fig. 16.3). The first domain is a \u03b2-barrel with up-and-down topology (red). Two adjacent strands in domain I are extended, forming domain II (yellow) which is a long \u201cfinger-like\u201d structure that runs parallel to the viral membrane. At the tip of domain II is the hydrophobic fusion loop which remains buried in the virion from the hydrophilic environment by interaction with domain III (blue) of the adjacent monomer in the E-E dimer. Domain I is also connected to domain III which bridges the E ectodomain with the so-called stem region that extends to the TM region of the protein.\n",

As in the case of influenza virus, the flavivirus E protein first binds to a cell surface receptor which induces endocytosis of the virion. Once in the acidic endosome, the E-E homodimer dissociates, resulting in disassembly of the icosahedral scaffold. The individual subunits swing outward by the hinge region that connects domains I and II, and the fusion loops insert into the target membrane. Lateral interactions between monomers facilitates reclustering into trimers [31]. These rearrangements lead to the formation of an extended trimeric structure, analogous to the pre-hairpin intermediate of class I fusion glycoproteins, in which two different regions of each E polypeptide are inserted into the two membranes to be fused. Collapse of the extended intermediate can proceed by rotation of domain III in each subunit about the segment that links it to domain I and zipping up of the stem alongside the clustered domains II. This refolding brings the two membranes together to initiate formation of the lipid stalk, the hemifusion diaphragm and the fusion pore.",

E1 has also three discernible domains, equivalent to those of flavivirus E. The only significant difference is the association of E1 with E2 in the virus particle. E2 interacts with the cell surface receptor to initiate the endocytic internalization of the SFV virion [32]. In the acidic endosome, E2 separates from E1 and it is probably degraded. Upon low pH exposure, E1 undergoes similar conformational changes to those of the flavivirus E protein, leading to fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes. Electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography results provide support for interactions between adjacent E1 trimers when the fusion loops are inserted in the target membrane to produce rings of five or six trimers. It has been postulated that these fivefold interactions would act at the fusion site to induce the formation of a nipple-like curvature in the viral and target membranes, favoring membrane fusion [33].

As in the case of influenza virus, binding of rhabdovirus G to a poorly characterized receptor at the cell surface induces endocytosis of the virus particle. Acidification of the endosome triggers G for membrane fusion. However, and in contrast with all other fusion proteins, the low pH inactivation of rhabdovirus G is reversible. Thus, virions inactivated by prolonged incubation at pH <6 can be reactivated by raising the pH to neutral [38]. This reversibility may be required to allow G to be transported through the acidic Golgi apparatus and to recover its native fusion-competent state when incorporated to new virions [39]. Given this reversibility, it is believed that the energy released during the structural transition of a single trimer from the pre-fusion to the post-fusion conformation is probably small, compared with the energetic barrier of the fusion reaction. In agreement with this hypothesis, the estimated number of rhabdovirus spikes required for fusion is higher (at least 15 trimers) than for other enveloped viruses.",

In the pre-fusion conformation, the fusion domain contains two fusion loops reminiscent of class II proteins that are oriented downward towards the viral membrane. After low pH exposure, the fusion domain moves upward by flipping relative to the central core of the trimer. Thus, an intermediate equivalent to the pre-hairpin structure of class I proteins is formed. This is followed by the reversal of the molecule around a central rigid block formed by lengthening of the central helix and refolding of the three C-terminal segments into helices that position themselves in the grooves of the central core in an anti-parallel manner. This six-helix bundle has obvious resemblance with that of the class I proteins.\n",

In contrast, membrane fusion mediated by herpesvirus gB can occur either at the plasma membrane or in endosomes, depending on the virus and the target cell type. In either case, attachment of herpesvirus to host cells follows a complex mechanism in which several viral glycoproteins interact with cell surface molecules.

Vaccinia virus internalization is believed to occur by macropinocytosis (a type of non-specific endocytosis). Four vaccinia virus proteins are involved in attachment to cell surface proteoglycans or laminin [43]. Eleven or 12 other relatively small glycoproteins, ranging in size between 35 and 377 amino acids, form the so-called entry fusion complex (EFC) that mediates membrane fusion [44]. These proteins have N- or C-terminal transmembrane domains but no sequence similarity with the fusion peptide of other viral fusion glycoproteins has been found in any of them. Therefore, the actual mechanism of vaccinia virus membrane fusion remains to be elucidated but it seems to be different from that of other enveloped viruses. By using conditional lethal mutants of each of the 11 proteins that make the EFC, it was found that eight of them were required to reach the hemifusion step and the other three were needed for completion of virus entry [44]. It is likely that hydrophobic regions of several proteins may assemble in the EFC to form a hydrophobic surface that could bind to the target membrane and drive membrane fusion by some novel mechanism.",

Most of the viral proteins required in the nucleus have their own nuclear localization signal (NLS), which is a cluster of basic amino acids. However, actual import of the viral ribonucleoprotein into the cell nucleus may require additional interactions with certain host factors. For instance, the NLS of the influenza nucleoprotein interacts with karyopherin \u03b1 and this in turn with karyopherin \u03b2 which mediates interactions with the proteins of the nuclear pore to promote nuclear import of the viral ribonucleoproteins by an energy-dependent process [49].",

Better understanding of fusion triggering may therefore bring new possibilities for the manipulation of virus entry.

            "text": "Fig. 16.1: Steps of the membrane fusion process. (a) Diagram of the fusion steps between two protein-free lipid bilayers. From top to bottom: the lipids (represented by heads and tails) of the two bilayers are initially curved into nipple-like structures that approach the two membranes. This is followed by formation of the stalk in which the two proximal leaflets are fused. This stalk is then expanded forming a hemifusion diaphragm in which lipids of the distal leaflets of the bilayers are now in direct contact. Finally, rupture of the hemifusion diaphragm leads to formation of the fusion pore. (b) Diagram of the virus-cell fusion process: As an example, fusion mediated by the influenza HA is illustrated. Left panels: HA is a homotrimer that initially binds to the cell surface (not shown) by interactions of each subunit head with sialic acid. Then, the virus is internalized by endocytosis. For simplicity, only 1 HA trimer in the pre-fusion conformation is shown, anchored into the viral membrane. After endosome acidification, the HA globular head falls apart, allowing refolding of the molecule to produce three long \u03b1-helices. The fusion peptides, placed at the N-terminal end of each \u03b1-helix, insert into the target membrane. This intermediate, dubbed pre-hairpin, refolds to bring the two membranes into proximity leading to formation of the lipid stalk followed by formation of the hemifusion diaphragm (not shown). Finally, the fusion pore is formed by the concerted action of several HA molecules that adopt a very stable post-fusion conformation. Right panels: The upper panel shows a mixture of an influenza virus particle (strain X31, H3N2, white arrow) and liposomes (some of them indicated by white arrowheads) made with lipids commonly found in cell membranes, incubated at neutral pH. Note the glycoprotein spikes (mostly haemagglutinin, HA) sticking out of the viral membrane in contrast with the smooth surface of liposomes. The middle panel shows the same virus/liposome mixture after incubation for 5\u201310 s at pH 5.0 followed by neutralization. Note binding of liposomes to the virus surface and initiation of virus-liposome fusion. The lower panel shows the virus/liposome mixture after incubation for 5 min at pH 5.0 followed by neutralization. Note that the virus has fused with several liposomes, yielding a large vesicle with viral glycoproteins disperse throughout the surface and with a small liposome still in the process of fusion. The HA spikes also have changed morphology after exposure to low pH and fusion. (Courtesy of L.J. Calder and S.A. Wharton, Division of Virology, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, London, UK). (c) Diagram of vesicle fusion at the synaptic junction: Initially one of the SNARE proteins (synaptobrevin, blue) is inserted into the vesicle membrane, while three other SNAREs (two SNAP 25, green and one syntaxin, red) are inserted in the plasma membrane. After an initial interaction, refolding of the SNAREs leads to formation of a bundle of four parallel \u03b1-helices that drives approximation of the two membranes and formation of the stalk and hemifusion intermediates (not shown). Completion of the SNARE complex results in formation of the fusion pore. In the two lower panels of parts (b) and (c), two HAs and two SNARE complexes are shown surrounding the fusion pore, although the actual number of molecules involved in fusion pore formation is likely to be higher",
