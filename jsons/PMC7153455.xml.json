While pulmonary function per se may recover to the point of allowing life without dyspnea [4], survivors of severe ARF such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) endure physical disability that includes weakness, weight loss, a decline in activities of daily living, and inability to return to their former jobs [5, 6]. In addition, psychosocial dysfunction may include decreased intellectual function, loss of memory, impaired concentration [7], and a form of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) characterized by depression, anxiety, memory of pain, dyspnea, and nightmares [7, 8]. Finally, families of ARF patients share this psychological and material burden, as they worry about their family members\u2019 survival as well as their own livelihood [9]. In this chapter we will classify ARF into two main categories, based on their effects on respiratory mechanics:Diseases that affect primarily the airways, i.e., asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), where the main physiological abnormality is an increase in airway resistance and consequent expiratory flow limitationDiseases that affect primarily the alveoli, such as pneumonia and ARDS, where the main physiological abnormality is a decreased lung compliance resulting in the need for increased ventilatory pressures that may injure the lung\n",

Once at steady state, this phenomenon (\u201cbreath stacking\u201d) leads to a new and increased lung volume at end expiration (functional residual capacity [FRC]), which exerts a pressure higher than the normal \u201c0\u201d (atmospheric pressure) of end expiration. This new end-expiratory pressure is commonly referred to as \u201c auto-PEEP\u201d or \u201cintrinsic PEEP\u201d (PEEPi) from its mechanical similarity to the PEEP set on a ventilator [17, 18]. Table 24.1 shows a summary of the effects of PEEP vs. PEEPi, highlighting similarities and differences. PEEPi remains a difficult concept to assimilate because it is not immediately \u201cseen\u201d on the ventilator screen. Figure 24.1 shows why that is the case and how to set the ventilator to detect PEEPi. Additional implications of PEEPi particularly regarding its effect on work of breathing that may hinder discontinuing ventilatory support are discussed in section \u201cChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).\u201d\n\n",

The principal challenge of ventilating asthmatic patients is the presence of increased resistance to gas flow in the airways. On inspiration, this may limit the size of tidal volume; on expiration, it may cause hyperinflation and PEEPi. The combination of high inspiratory pressures and severe hyperinflation poses a risk for hemodynamic instability and barotrauma; limiting the size of V\nT may prevent these life-threatening complications. Permissive hypercapnea uses small V\nT limiting hyperinflation and allows PaCO2 to rise. With proper monitoring of arterial pH and hemodynamic variables, this strategy has been used safely in severe asthma [20]. A helium/oxygen gas mixture of 80:20 or 70:30 (\u201cheliox\u201d) decreases R\nAW in obstructed large airways because helium is less dense than nitrogen. Heliox is most indicated for upper airway obstruction where the airway is reduced to an orifice through which the low density of helium works best. It has been used with success in severe asthma [21], where the drawback is the inability to deliver high FiO2.",

Patients with moderate-to-severe COPD may have serum bicarbonate levels of 28\u201332 mEq/L with nearly normal pH. Such finding on a chemistry profile may help in the evaluation of a stable COPD patient when an arterial blood gas analysis is not available, although caution must still be used to rule out a primary metabolic alkalosis.

Unique to COPD is the progressive destruction of elastic tissue compromising the ability of the lungs to recoil passively to FRC. Hence, the end-expiratory lung volume increases, and the end-inspiratory lung volume has to increase accordingly to maintain V\nT. At steady state, the respiratory system resets the process of ventilation at a higher lung volume causing chronic lung hyperinflation (\u201cbarrel chest\u201d on physical exam). Hyperinflation has unfavorable consequences on the mechanics of breathing, because (a) inspiration has to start from a flattened diaphragm and a less efficient shape for contraction and (b) more energy has to be spent to overcome the PEEPi generated by the larger end-expiratory volume with each breath (see previous section \u201cAsthma\u201d). The stable COPD patient with hyperinflation compensates for the added load by slightly decreasing the minute ventilation and retaining bicarbonate (above), but has to spend more energy to overcome these unfavorable mechanics. This can be a fragile steady state; when a perturbation occurs from infection, trauma, or surgery, the COPD patient is at risk for acute respiratory failure.",

Figure 24.1 shows how PEEPi can be measured at the bedside by occluding the expiratory limb of the ventilator, i.e., performing an end-expiratory hold maneuver. This provides a closed ventilator/patient system that equilibrates at a pressure close to the one in the hyperinflated alveoli, as long as the airways to those alveoli are not occluded. However, the expiratory hold maneuver is reliable only if the system is allowed some time (1\u20133 s.) to equilibrate, which requires a slow respiratory rate with no inspiratory effort during the maneuver. This unfortunately is not a common occurrence in the ICU, as opposed, e.g., under anesthesia, where patients are commonly paralyzed. In the spontaneously breathing patient, PEEPi can be measured with the aid of an esophageal balloon to measure pleural pressure [31]. Short of that, which is not routine practice, one can just detect the expiratory flow limitation by the inspection of the flow trace on the ventilator display. Normally, expiratory flow reaches a baseline of 0 flow before the start of the next breath; with flow limitation, the trace will be abruptly truncated at the start of the next breath without any visible baseline of 0 flow (Fig. 24.1).",

Such injury damages the lung parenchyma with edema and disruption of the alveolar walls, extravasation of blood cells and plasma into the alveolar spaces, and thickening of the epithelial layer with deposits reminiscent of the hyaline membranes of the premature neonate. This initial phase is characterized by inhomogeneity of alveolar lesions with areas of edema, consolidation, or collapse next to areas seemingly normally aerated and others overdistended. This inhomogeneity, which became apparent with the introduction of lung computed tomography (CT) scanning [35], is such that a pressure applied at the airway may affect areas that get recruited, areas that cannot be recruited, and areas that do not need to be recruited at all. Thus, mechanical ventilation can recruit some alveoli and damage others within the same breath. The balance of these two effects will determine the progression towards healing vs. exacerbating the existing injury (\u201cventilator-induced lung injury\u201d [VILI]) [36]. In a later phase, the lung parenchyma is progressively occupied by inflammatory infiltrates, and edema is substituted by collagen deposition and remodeling (fibroproliferative phase) [33]. This phase, often overlapping within the same lung with the acute changes described above, results in the need for further increase in ventilatory pressures, possibly perpetuating the lung injury.",

These parameters can be measured with relative ease and allow calculation of R\nAW and C at the bedside (see Eqs. (24.1), (24.2), and (24.3) and Fig. 24.2), but a few caveats need to be well thought out:Using the V\nT as the \u2206V assumes that C does not change at different lung volumes. While this is mostly correct in the normal individual, it may not be in ARDS. Figure 24.3 shows the relationship between P\nPLAT and V\nT (the slope of which is C) in normal and in ARDS. This relationship is almost linear in the normal state, i.e., C does not change with lung volume. On the contrary, in ARDS the slope is lower and the relationship sigmoid. This implies that with ARDS, the value of C may change with different inspiratory pressures, expiratory pressures, and V\nT\u2019s.\nWe are measuring the overall C of an inhomogeneous lung, meaning that the patterns of distributions of lung lesions in ARDS may differ significantly while the same compliance is obtained. The two patients in Fig. 24.4 had similarly low compliance values measured (correctly) at the bedside. One can easily see how the set V\nT will distribute fairly evenly in patient A even though at high inspiratory pressures; in patient B, the same V\nT will reach almost exclusively the ventral areas of the lungs, likely overdistending them and producing negligible recruitment of the dorsal areas.\nWe are measuring respiratory C as pertaining to the whole respiratory system (C\nRS), which is made up by the compliance of two structures in series, the lung and the chest wall:\n24.6\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ 1/{C}_{\\mathrm{RS}}=1/{C}_{\\mathrm{L}}+1/{C}_{\\mathrm{CW}}, $$\n\\end{document}1/CRS=1/CL+1/CCW,where C\nL indicates C of the lung and C\nCW indicates C of the chest wall.

However, a \u201ctight\u201d chest wall is still important because it will increase ventilating pressures without increasing pressures within the lung. Hence, a decreased C\nCW may limit lung recruitment and prevent lung injury at the same time. What determines alveolar recruitment and damage is the pressure across the lung or \u201ctranspulmonary pressure\u201d (P\nTP), which is the difference between the two pressures surrounding the lung, i.e., the alveolar pressure (P\nALV) and the pleural (P\nPL) pressure:24.7\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ {P}_{\\mathrm{TP}}={P}_{\\mathrm{ALV}}-{P}_{\\mathrm{PL}}. $$\n\\end{document}PTP=PALV\u2212PPL.Unfortunately, neither P\nALV nor P\nPL can be directly measured, but they are reasonably estimated by P\nPLAT and esophageal pressure (P\nESO), respectively [38].

However, by understanding this concept, one can adjust ventilating pressures (P\nPLAT and PEEP) to somewhat higher values in patients with a low C\nCW, knowing that a lower P\nTP is being \u201cseen\u201d by the lung than would be with a normal C\nCW.",

            "text": "Mechanical ventilation may injure the lung. Experimental evidence of lung injury by high\nventilatory pressure/volume or by insufficient PEEP has been available for decades [40], but clinicians would see little alternative to using high ventilatory settings when ARDS patients were often profoundly hypoxemic or hypercarbic. In such cases, higher ventilatory pressures might have been the only way to avoid death (at least temporarily). With the advent of modern techniques of ventilation and improved critical care practice in general, the time was ripe for change. This happened with the demonstration that a V\nT of 6 mL/kg of ideal body weight (IBW) decreased the absolute mortality rate of patients with ARDS by about 10 % [41]. The use of 6\u20138 mL/kg IBW V\nT has become standard of care of ventilating the ARDS lung, and a broader strategy of \u201clung-protective ventilation\u201d has been developed [1, 36]. The following are considerations that are still debated as evidence-based guidelines of lung-protective ventilation continue to be developed:Using a V\nT of 6 mL/kg IBW applies to patients with ARDS, not necessarily to all patients that are intubated and ventilated. In non-ARDS patients, such as immediate postoperative patients, or patients who are in the process of weaning from ventilatory support, such low VT may sometimes result in insufficient ventilatory support and promote atelectasis.Having demonstrated the beneficial effect of a 6 vs. 12 mL/kg IBW V\nT does not forbid that in some patients 7 or 5 mL/kg would be best. In a heterogeneously injured lung (section \u201cPathophysiology\u201d), the inspiratory pressure generated by a 6 ml/kg V\nT may or may not recruit collapsed alveoli and/or may damage inflated alveoli [42, 43]. Using a higher V\nT or applying other ways to increase alveolar pressure such as higher PEEP or a recruitment maneuver [44] may injure the lung. Using V\nT lower than 6 mL/kg may limit alveolar damage but may derecruit the lung and decrease V\nT to the point of needing the assist of additional means to rescue gas exchange [43] (section \u201cExtracorporeal Circulation\u201d).Setting the best level of PEEP needs further definition. PEEP helps to maintain alveoli open throughout the respiratory cycle (as it occurs without PEEP under normal circumstances) and prevents expiratory VILI [40]. A number of ways have been suggested to identify the ideal level of PEEP to maximize recruitment and avoid overdistention. Constructing a semi-static P/V curve by insufflating the lung with increasing volumes (Fig. 24.3) may accomplish this task, but it is cumbersome and imprecise [45]. Functional CT scan images allow discriminating between various degrees of alveolar inflation [43] but are currently limited to specialized centers. Alternatively, a bedside \u201cPEEP trial\u201d can prove useful. With the patient on volume ventilation exerting no or minimal spontaneous effort, PEEP is increased by, e.g., 2 cmH2O; for a set V\nT , the P\nPLAT is measured before and after the intervention; a decrease or no significant change of P\nPLAT indicates that recruitment has occurred; an increase of about the same as the increase of PEEP is insignificant, and an increase of more than 2 cmH2O indicates overdistention. The PaO2 will likely increase or stay the same until severe overdistention occurs. The trial can continue by small increments of PEEP until signs of overdistention or untoward hemodynamic effects are detected; the trial should be repeated at least daily in early ARDS because the mechanics of the lung with acute injury change rapidly.\nSetting the best FiO\n2. Limiting FiO2 prevents O2 toxicity and absorption atelectasis. O2 toxicity is related to both FiO2 and duration of exposure, but specifics on neither are available. Practically, it is sensible to limit FiO2 to reach O2 saturation above 90 % unless other factors limiting O2 delivery are present, such as profound anemia or low cardiac output. The current focus on lung-protective ventilation tends to prioritize optimizing respiratory mechanics over avoiding O2 toxicity. Most would agree that an FiO2 of 60 % or less is desirable and that an FiO2 of 40 % or less is safe.\n",

If the cause of acute myocardial dysfunction is treated, the respiratory symptoms resolve rapidly. The differential diagnosis of cardiogenic edema is based on physical examination, chest radiogram, electrocardiogram, transthoracic echocardiography, and sometimes invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Useful biomarkers are plasma levels of natriuretic peptides (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] and the N-terminal proBNP), which are cleaved from a prohormone released from myocytes in response to ventricular dilatation and pressure overload.

We recommend this practice as part of daily evaluation of stable patients undergoing a program of discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. The main barrier to obtain reliable measurements of mechanics in this patient population is the presence of spontaneous breathing; however, in many cases, with appropriate coaching and at times a short-acting sedative, it will be possible to achieve the necessary inspiratory and expiratory hold maneuvers.\nA\nresistive load is common in asthma and COPD, but it may also occur in any patient with ARF during acute attacks of bronchospasm due to allergy, airway infections, or mechanical irritation from, e.g., an intraluminal mass, trauma, or instrumentation [18, 85]. Within the context of resistive load, an important phenomenon is the patient\u2019s failure to trigger an assisted breath because of inability to overcome PEEPi. Figure 24.6 shows this phenomenon. It is important to note that the ventilator will not count the non-triggered breaths even though it displays them, thus underestimating the true respiratory rate, leading the unaware clinician to a false sense of reassurance of a \u201cnormal\u201d respiratory rate that may be substantially lower than the patient\u2019s.\n\nAn\nelastic load is common in patients recovering from ARDS, pneumonia, or severe lung contusion. A frequent cause of elastic load is pulmonary edema due to residual lung injury, hypoproteinemia, and volume overload, particularly in the presence of LV dysfunction or renal insufficiency. Induced diuresis is a common prescription in a ventilatory unit, and management of volume status, fluid, and electrolytes balances a related challenge. Elastic load can be offset by an increase in mean P\nAW [see Eq. (24.9)] and consequent recruitment. An attractive way to increase mean P\nAW is by the applications of periodic recruitment maneuvers with CPAP, BiPAP, or sighs [86]. Elastic load can also come from pathology of the chest wall, such as large pleural effusions, abdominal distention, and thoracic deformities due to trauma or surgery. Pleural effusions may contribute to increase elastic work of breathing and worsen gas exchange during weaning from mechanical ventilation. However, these effects may be often overestimated, because the effect of their drainage can be remarkably unrewarding [87].\n",

Active training of the respiratory muscles by imposing loads (e.g., decreasing the trigger sensitivity) has not been established to be effective and may be detrimental if the patient reaches a level of fatigue. On the contrary, reducing the load is generally feasible and can be monitored at the bedside by repeated measurements of respiratory mechanics. Pharmacologic treatments for both resistive and elastic ventilatory loads have been reviewed earlier in the chapter and include standard treatment of bronchospasm, pulmonary edema, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia. Surveillance of extra-respiratory pathology will also benefit. For example, myocardial ischemia may occur in patients with abnormal coronary physiology when increased O2 consumption by the myocardium may occur during trials of decreased ventilatory support because of the need for extra oxygen consumption, and this may trigger acute myocardial dysfunction and pulmonary edema [88].",

PSV allows the patient to control the breathing pattern to a degree superior to any other mode and has become the most frequently used weaning mode [1]. Once a low level of PSV has been reached, a SBT is performed once or twice daily, and, if passed, the patient is ready to be separated from the ventilator.\nProgressive lengthening of unsupported breathing during assist-control ventilation ([AC], Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-19668-8_26) mode, allowing assisted breathing but without progressive withdrawal. When judged appropriately by the clinician, the ventilator is removed. Supporters of this way of weaning claim superiority because it allows direct inspection of the patient without the confusing addition of PSV [91]. This method should allow shorter weanings (PSV would mask the ability to discontinue the ventilator earlier) and higher success rate (a low level of PSV would mask the inability to sustain unassisted breathing).\n",
