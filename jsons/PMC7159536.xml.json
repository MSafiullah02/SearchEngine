            "text": "Mycoplasma pneumonia of swine (MPS) is a global endemic chronic respiratory disease in the swine industry. This disease, which is induced mainly by Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infection, causes sizeable economic losses due to increased veterinary costs and product loss (Thacker et al. 1999; Maes et al. 2008). M. hyopneumoniae is located in the lumina of the respiratory tract, as well as the mucosal surface of the trachea, bronchi and bronchioles (Blanchard et al. 1992); it can propagate on tracheal and bronchial surfaces after infection. In MPS, the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelia show a loss of cilia from the epithelial cells and sloughing of epithelial cells into the airway lumina (Redondo et al. 2009). The primary clinical sign is a sporadic, dry, nonproductive cough (Thacker et al. 1999). Destruction of the cilia by M. hyopneumoniae increases the morbidity to other pathogens such as Pasteurella multocida, porcine respiratory virus, reproductive syndrome virus, porcine circovirus type 2, and porcine respiratory coronavirus (Ciprian et al. 1988; Thacker et al. 1999; Kim et al. 2003; Maes et al. 2008).",

However, these measures cannot completely eradicate the involved pathogens or inhibit their transmission. Further, the residue of the antibiotic in livestock products and antibacterial substances in domesticated animals is heavily regulated in Japan (The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Japan 2014). Therefore, safer and more efficient ways to control swine chronic respiratory diseases are necessary.",

Previously, we have reported the immune responsiveness of this MPS\u2010selected Landrace line to sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) (Katayama et al. 2011) and M. hyopneumoniae vaccine sensitization (Shimazu et al. 2013, 2014).

Pigs were raised in a crude, vinyl\u2010roofed, open\u2010air barn with a bedding of rice husks. The bedding was neither changed or cleaned, nor was the excrement removed during the experiment, in order to provide stressful conditions with a bad environment. During the experimental period, M. hypneumoniae vaccine (HYORESP\u00ae; Merial Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), which consisted of an inactivated, adjuvant whole\u2010cell preparation, was injected intramuscularly twice, once on day \u22127 and again, on day 0, after blood collection. Thus, day 0 was defined as the day when the second dose of vaccine was administered. Immune functional analyses of the samples were conducted on days \u22127, 0, 2, 7 and 14. Blood samples were collected via jugular venipuncture into vacuum tubes containing heparin and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA: Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). At each sampling time, salivary samples were collected from the oral cavity with a cotton swab. In order to confirm the presence of pathogenic M. hyopneumoniae, we sampled the nasal mucus of each animal at each blood sampling time. On day 14, all pigs were killed by stunning at the anatomy facilities of Tohoku University, and immune tissues were collected. At this time, pulmonary MPS lesions were confirmed and measured by the veterinarian. In experiment 1, half of the pigs (six MPS\u2010selected and six non\u2010selected) were killed on day 14, and the remaining pigs remained until they reached a body weight of approximately 110 kg (average age, 23 weeks), when they were transported to the slaughterhouse (day 30 in this experimental period) to be slaughtered at the Miyagi Prefecture meat market center. After slaughter, pulmonary MPS lesions were examined. Blood samples were not collected from these animals on day 14.",

Compared with the non\u2010selected Landrace line, the percentage of B cells in peripheral blood (experiments 1 and 2) and their IgG secretions (experiment 2) and the proliferative abilities of PBMCs (experiment 1) were significantly decreased in the MPS\u2010selected Landrace line. Furthermore, the same result was confirmed in our previous study that the SRBC\u2010specific IgG production was decreased in the MPS\u2010selected line (Katayama et al. 2011). In addition, previous studies have indicated that increased IgG production in serum is not directly involved in the clinical resistance to mycoplasma pneumonia (Thacker et al. 1998; Chen et al. 2006). These results also indicate that increased antibody\u2010specific IgG production most likely contributes to MPS lung lesion severity during natural infection.",

B cells are the major immune cells that express both GH and GH receptors (Hattori et al. 2001; Hattori 2009). GH promotes lymphocyte survival and proliferation (Jeay et al. 2002; Borghetti et al. 2006). Therefore, the decrease in B cell percentage, GH secretion and proliferative ability of PBMCs in the MPS\u2010selected line suggests that these traits correlate with each other. Donahue et al. (2006) had reported that the secretion of GH was increased in male rats and female rats during diestrus exposed to a stressor. From this, the MPS\u2010selected Landrace line may be less susceptible to stress than the non\u2010selected Landrace line.

Peripheral blood IgG and saliva IgA are produced by different tissues or organs. The IgG and monomeric type of IgA are known to be produced in lymph node, spleen and bone marrow, and then secreted in blood. The dimeric type of IgA secreted in saliva is mainly produced in submucous\u2010lymph tissues, and then secreted in tears, saliva, sweat, colostrum (Parham 2009). The mucosal immune system is a first defense line of inner body surfaces and IgA is essential in this surface defense system. Secretion of IgA is critical for protection against infectious pathogens (Phalipon et al. 2002; Brandtzaeg 2003; Tlaskalov\u00e1\u2010Hogenov\u00e1 et al. 2004). Increased IgA secretion may also play a protective role against M. hyopneumoniae infections in the upper respiratory tract (Woolard et al. 2004).

These differences in immune response suggest a genetically correlated response according to MPS selection. By recognizing microbe\u2010associated molecular patterns, the TLR family plays a critical role in host defense and in the development of inflammation. TLR2 recognizes ligands from Gram\u2010positive bacteria, whereas TLR4 responds to endotoxin from Gram\u2010negative bacteria. TLRs are also involved in the responses to lung injury (Jiang et al. 2005) and to M. hyopneumoniae infection (Chu et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2008; Love et al. 2010). IL\u20106 is a primary cytokine responsible for acute inflammation (Thacker 2006) and M. hyopneumoniae clearance in lungs (Pietsch et al. 1994; Wu et al. 2008). IL\u201010 is an endogenous regulator that is critical for chemokine expression in acute lung inflammation (Shanley et al. 2000). These results indicate that interactions between these cytokines and TLRs may contribute to the balance of the inflammatory and immune responses in the lungs of the MPS\u2010selected line.",
