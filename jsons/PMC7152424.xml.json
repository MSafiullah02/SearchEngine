In this sense, immunization programs are package delivery systems: they manage the flow of antigens, formulated in vaccines and packaged in different presentations, between the point of origin at the vaccine manufacturer and the point of consumption, inside antigen-presenting cells (APCs) of the vaccinee. This simple concept of delivering antigen packages from point to point can help elucidate the complex logistical challenges inherent in the preservation, packaging, storage, transportation, and administration of vaccines.",

Continual sharpening of this public health tool is needed to achieve the full potential of immunization for improving health. Some advances will come in the form of better vaccine antigens; however, significant potential also lies in improving the way vaccines are packaged and delivered. Reviewing immunization as a package delivery process and recognizing critical hurdles, bottlenecks, and barriers to vaccine flow is a first step toward making immunization programs more efficient and effective. Managing vaccine flow around those obstacles is the day-to-day work of immunization programs, which often requires heroic effort. This chapter briefly describes key restrictions to vaccine flow logistics in terms of complexity, cost, human resources requirements, distributability, and sources of errors in the immunization process. It reviews new technologies in various stages of development that have the potential to eliminate or reduce restrictions to vaccine flow. These new technologies have the potential to increase the capacity and efficiency of immunization programs and make immunization safer and more effective, affordable, accessible, and acceptable for everyone.",

Vaccine manufacturing plants are highly capitalized, multimillion-dollar facilities that use sophisticated technology to mass-produce the billions of doses of vaccines used globally each year. Two critical vaccine flow logistics requirements start in the plant and span the entire immunization process up to vaccination of the individual: (a) maintenance of vaccine purity and (b) maintenance of vaccine potency by keeping it within the prescribed temperature range. These impose significant restrictions on vaccine flow logistics.",

This requirement, which is met by the system known as the cold chain, constricts the flow of vaccine to facilities and delivery mechanisms that have refrigeration or cold pack storage capabilities. Some vaccines, especially those that include aluminum adjuvants, are susceptible to damage from freezing temperatures. Others, especially live attenuated vaccines, are more susceptible to loss of potency at elevated temperatures. Through the addition of stabilizers and, in some cases, the additional step of lyophilization (freeze drying), vaccines maintain minimum potency under the required storage conditions, throughout the listed shelf life. When breaks in the cold chain are detected, valuable vaccines are discarded. When undetected, cold chain failures can result in administration of ineffective vaccine.",

In contrast to many pharmaceuticals, all currently licensed vaccines are administered as liquids\u2014by needle and syringe injection, oral delivery, or nasal spray. Most vaccines are formulated, packaged, and shipped as liquids in single- or multidose vials or prefilled syringes. All others are first formulated as liquids, packaged in vials, and then lyophilized to enhance their stability. Although they are shipped in a dry format, lyophilized vaccines must be accompanied by a liquid diluent and reconstituted before on-site filling of the administration device and vaccination. Liquid diluents increase the volume and weight of the vaccine, which may increase shipping costs and require more cold chain storage capacity. There is also the risk of spilling and leakage. Thus, the lyophilized format of vaccine with liquid diluent can slow down efficient vaccine flow.",

They also reduce the number of components to be shipped; eliminate the need for a separate supply chain for vaccine, diluent, and administration devices; and reduce filling overage required for vials and ampules.

This increases delivery complexity and creates an opportunity for errors, such as withdrawing the wrong dose amount from the vial or contamination of the vaccine. Vaccines in vials can be in single- or multidose format. Multidose vials typically cost less per dose and occupy less cold chain space than single-dose vials; however, vaccine wastage may be increased with multidose vials if a vial is opened when there are fewer people needing vaccine than the doses in the vial. Vaccinators also may be reluctant to open a 10-dose vial if only one or two people need vaccine, leading to missed opportunities to vaccinate those people. Repeated entry into a multidose vial and time lapse between vaccine withdrawals increase the risk of bacterial or fungal overgrowth, with subsequent injection of a contaminated vaccine. Single-dose vials avoid some of these problems but cost more per dose, occupy more cold chain space, and still require on-site filling of the delivery device.",

Other challenges with reconstitution include the potential for mismatched amounts of dry vaccine and diluent\u2014which are often shipped and stored separately, with vaccine in the cold chain and diluent at ambient temperature\u2014and a temperature difference between the diluent and the dried vaccine, which may render some vaccines ineffective upon reconstitution.",

Mass production of needles and syringes results in extremely low costs for these devices. Injection breaches the skin's stratum corneum, the protective layers of dead keratinized epithelial cells, to deposit vaccine in direct contact with the underlying dermal, SC, or muscle tissues. IM and SC delivery of vaccines by needle and syringe provides highly consistent dosing. For ID injection, because the dermal layer is so thin, precise targeted deposition is more difficult, so ID needle injection may provide less consistent delivery to the targeted tissues.

Both methods share the advantages of being needle free and present the possibility for simple administration methods. Mucosal vaccination mimics the route of entry, through portals to mucosal tissues, of many infectious agents and typically provides higher levels of mucosal immunity. The major challenge of mucosal vaccination is that delivery of antigen to the target tissues can be much less consistent than IM or SC vaccination by injection. Mucosal vaccination deposits vaccine on internal surfaces of the body. Although the vaccine is inside the body, it still must evade a variety of defense mechanisms to penetrate the mucosal surface and contact target tissues. Mucus flow, gastric acid, mucosal antibodies, and other antimicrobial substances continually destroy or remove substances on mucosal surfaces. As a result, mucosal vaccination generally requires higher doses of antigen, macrodelivery technologies to assure tissue contact, and more specialized antigen microdelivery packaging to reach APCs consistently.",

            "text": "Vaccination delivers the antigen package into the person receiving the vaccine, but delivery is not complete until APCs internalize the antigen. Immunization involves mimicry: vaccines must never be pathogenic, but must cause the APCs to respond to antigens as pathogens. One of the first principles of this mimicry is that the antigen package should be \u201cpathogen-sized.\u201d Free antigen in solution is typically ignored by immune cells; however, APCs readily take up microparticle packages that are in the size range of pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, by phagocytosis and endocytosis. These microparticle antigen packages are likely to be assessed as threatening and to initiate an immune response. Molecular antigen packages may include adjuvants, which are nonantigen components designed to trigger or modify an immune response. Some adjuvants act as package \u201cwarning labels\u201d to alert activation of the innate immune system. Other adjuvants create a depot effect, which causes the antigen package to be opened gradually, prolonging the presence of antigen at the delivery site. Another molecular antigen packaging strategy is inclusion of specific cellular address labels. Typically, vaccine macrodelivery systems place the molecular antigen package in or near the tissues where APCs reside or traverse. For some vaccines, using molecules that match receptors on APCs such as dendritic cells or M cells increases the likelihood of delivery specifically to these cells. Many molecular packaging strategies for antigen delivery that are in use or in development are described in detail in Chapters 64 and Chapter 65, and examples are described briefly later in this chapter. Once the APCs have received the antigen package, the next step is processing of antigen and presentation to lymphocytes to initiate the immune response, which is well described in Chapter 2.",

War and other armed conflicts interrupt routine vaccination services and displace large populations away from available services, often concentrating people in refugee settings that significantly increase the risk of disease and the need for vaccines. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, or hurricanes disrupt local infrastructure, including transportation, electricity needed to maintain the cold chain, and vaccine supply.

These studies have typically found aluminum coagulation and difficulty in reconstitution for lyophilized adjuvanted vaccines, although additional excipients and a thin film freeze-drying process may provide freeze protection.43, 44 The SFD method produced a homogenous suspension, indicating the feasibility of this approach for aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines.45 Evaluation of SFD of HBsAg without aluminum in combination with inulin or dextran/trehalose stabilizers demonstrated enhanced thermostability (up to 60\u00b0C). However, preclinical immunogenicity studies of this formulation demonstrated immunoglobulin (Ig) G immune responses that were lower than responses to aluminum-adjuvanted HBsAg.46 SFD has also been assessed for meningitis A and measles vaccines.47, 48\n",

The Eulysis Single Vial System (SVS) is composed of two compartments: the lyophilized or dry powder pharmaceutical is in a thin plastic cup resting on a glass vial that contains the diluent (see Fig. 68.2G). Actuation of a piston-like cap punctures the base of the plastic cup, causing the contents to fall into the diluent and permitting reconstitution; a needle and syringe must be used to withdraw a dose from the vial. A tamper-evident cap protects the piston cap from activation during shipment. This technology is in early-stage development and may potentially have wide-ranging applications for all freeze-dried injectable products. The Pfizer Injectable Act-O-Vial System demonstrates a similar concept. A rubber septum separates diluent and dry compartments of a nonstandard glass vial. Pushing down on the plastic cap dislodges the septum, forcing it into the lower dry compartment where reconstitution occurs. The Act-O-Vial is used with Pfizer's glucocorticoids Solu-Cortef and Solu-Medrol.110, 111\n",

The Integrity Bio LyoTip distal hub incorporates a spiral-shaped channel to facilitate mixing of diluent and lyophilized pharmaceutical. The hub requires a Luer lock needle and syringe for delivery. The NOVA Laboratories Hydration Rehydration Injection System (HydRIS) is similar to the LyoTip: it is an attachment filled with lyophilized pharmaceutical for a prefilled diluent syringe (see Fig. 68.2H). A unique feature of the HydRIS is use of a stabilization technology based on sugar glass (an amorphous solid, clear crystallized form of the sugar): the pharmaceutical is dried onto a membrane, which is then integrated into the distal hub. The sugar-based membrane dissolves when it contacts the diluent, allowing the instantaneous mixing of diluent and lyophilized pharmaceutical.",

Following injection of a vaccine, the antigen or adjuvant generates a local innate immune response, attracting APCs which ingest the vaccine package. These infiltrating dendritic cells (see Fig. 68.3B) and monocytes migrate to local draining lymph nodes and induce B- and T-cell immune responses. In general, SC and IM injection of vaccines tends to be less effective at producing mucosal immunity than mucosal vaccination.119\n",

A recent study with this now-discontinued DSJI found that delivery of MMR vaccine did not meet noninferiority criteria in comparison with needle and syringe delivery.267 PharmaJet subsequently received market clearance for the Stratis device (see Fig. 68.4C), which was the first DSJI to receive WHO prequalification, in 2013.

In a bench study testing injection of MMR vaccine through pig skin into a vial with three PharmaJet injectors, there was no loss of measles or mumps vaccine virus infectivity but some loss of rubella infectivity with two of the devices.271a Other examples of DSJIs developed for vaccine delivery include the Bioject ZetaJet (see Fig. 68.4D),272 the DCI Lectrajet (see Fig. 68.4E),273, 274 and the MIT Med-Jet H-4 (see Fig. 68.4F) and Dart.248\n",

They also have the potential to increase acceptability and immunization coverage rates. Reduced crying has been observed when vaccines are delivered to infants with jet injection compared with needle and syringe injections.258, 267 However, like syringes with needles, DSJI syringes require on-site filling following vaccine reconstitution (if required). Prefilled DSJI syringes in development by PharmaJet and other manufacturers may enable greater efficiency and speed of administration, similar to that of the old generation of MUNJIs. Use of DSJIs likely will entail higher costs because of the higher cost of manufacturing a DSJI syringe and the cost of the durable injector, but modeling indicates the potential for overall cost savings compared with needles and syringes when the indirect costs of iatrogenic disease resulting from the latter are included.257, 275 As with all vaccination systems that require a durable administration device, distributability of the vaccine is restricted by the need to have a device available at every POC when vaccine is delivered. The cost of a jet injector can be negligible if amortized over many doses in high-vaccination\u2013volume settings. However, in POCs with low-vaccination volumes, the cost of these devices may be prohibitive.",

Keratinocytes germinate just above the basement membrane, which demarcates the boundary between epidermis and deeper dermis. These cells then grow, flatten, mature, and senesce in increasingly superficial strata until they reach the surface and are sloughed. The main product of this cell is keratohyalin, a dense lipid that helps form a waterproof barrier. The lateral edges of adjacent keratinocytes are tightly linked by desmosomes, which maintain the strength of the epidermis and also contribute to its resistance to the passage of foreign matter or molecules.308, 309\n",

The term microneedles refers to hollow projections shorter than 1000 \u00b5m. Microarray patches are arrays of solid projections (without lumens) shorter than 1000 \u00b5m.

Termed the Soluvia Micro-Delivery System, it was licensed exclusively by Sanofi Pasteur for certain vaccine applications. Sanofi Pasteur undertook a series of clinical trials with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine,345, 346, 347, 348, 349 which led to marketing approval in Europe in 2009 for ID delivery of its Intanza and IDflu products. These contained either 9 \u00b5g of viral hemagglutinin per strain per 0.1 mL for adults through age 59 years,350 or a full (non\u2013dosage-sparing) 15 \u00b5g for those age 60 years and older.345, 346, 347 Sanofi Pasteur's U.S. brand of ID influenza vaccine (Fluzone Intradermal), similarly containing 9 \u00b5g per strain, was found to induce geometric mean titers of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody that were noninferior to those of control patients receiving conventional Fluzone by the IM route with 15 \u00b5g per strain. In 2011, the FDA licensed the vaccine and its unique prefilled delivery system with an indication that it be used only for patients 18 to 64 years of age. Several other countries (e.g., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) have also licensed a Sanofi influenza vaccine in the Soluvia mini-needle delivery system.",

A spring-powered device contains liquid drug prefilled into a glass dose chamber. Upon triggering, a spike pierces the stopper of the chamber through which the dose passes and is forced slowly, over a period of 5 to 40 minutes, through the microneedles into the skin of the upper arm or thigh. Adhesive keeps the system in place until delivery is complete. Delivery of equine tetanus antitoxin to swine as a model for delivery of monoclonal antibodies resulted in pharmacokinetic profiles of tetanus antitoxin similar to dosages via SC injection.369 Other industry and academic groups have pursued development of hollow microneedles, including Debiotech and the Georgia Institute of Technology.249, 370\n",

The PharmaJet Tropis (Fig. 68.6A\n) and the Bioject ID Pen (see Fig. 68.6B) are two new spring-powered DSJIs designed solely for ID delivery of 0.05 and 0.1-mL volumes.",

However, IPV is more expensive to produce and more difficult to deliver in campaign settings than OPV, promoting a search for cost-saving strategies that also avoid the introduction of needles into the polio eradication program. Recent clinical research has compared full doses of IPV given intramuscularly (0.5 mL) with ID delivery of 0.1 mL by either needle-free jet injectors or the Mantoux technique. In studies evaluating a primary series of immunizations in infants, some have found equivalent seroconversion rates, while others have shown reduced responses with ID jet injection.258, 259, 421 In all the trials conducted in infants, ID delivery of reduced doses of IPV has resulted in lower titers of neutralizing antibodies, whether reported as geometric mean titers or median titers, and whether or not the study was performed in poliovirus-na\u00efve infants or in infants receiving supplemental doses of IPV.258, 259, 420, 422 It has been suggested, however, that any detectable neutralizing antibody titer should be sufficient to prevent paralytic disease.258 Clinical trials using a single dose of IPV for boosting immunity in previously immunized children and adults generally have found that ID delivery of a 20% (0.1 mL) dose is immunogenic but often does not meet noninferiority criteria compared with full-dose IM delivery.266, 269, 270\n",

For example, in formulations prepared at Georgia Institute of Technology, a key ingredient of the carboxycellulose matrix of the dried coating was trehalose, one of several sugars, including sucrose, that have been found useful in protecting protein antigens from damage by drying and freezing, thereby improving vaccine thermostability.473, 474 Microarray patches have the potential to enable dose sparing of some vaccines, and some patches may also provide an adjuvant-like effect themselves by increasing local cell death.475\n",

The required wear times for microarray patches are not yet fixed and differ among designs. In preclinical studies, wear times for some microarray patches for vaccines have been greater than 5 minutes but can also be around 2 minutes. Ideally, delivery times would be sufficiently rapid to allow for quick application, removal, and proper disposal by a healthcare worker. If longer wear times are required for successful delivery, early removal is a risk, leading to possible insufficient antigen delivery as well as disposal of vaccine antigen outside the location of the supervised immunization session. If the vaccine recipient remains in the clinic or otherwise-supervised environment of delivery, increased vaccination time and thus reduced throughput might have a negative impact on overall program efficiencies. Coated microarray patches might be considered both sharps and infectious waste material after they have been used and in contact with bodily fluids, so the risk of needlestick injury remains a consideration. The need for an applicator (whether separate or integrated with the patch) to reliably apply the microarray patches is another key question, as are cost and logistical implications for immunization programs. A visual or auditory indicator may also be important to reassure users and recipients that the vaccine has been delivered correctly.472, 476\n",

Robust antibody and cellular immune responses provided complete protection from lethal challenge in mice, and a clinical trial is in progress.481a, 482 Several sugars, such as trehalose, sucrose, and maltose, have been found to be key ingredients in stabilizing and maintaining the potency of antigen during the process of forming dissolvable microarray patches, and studies have shown up to 4 months of stability at 40\u00b0C for measles vaccine in a microarray patch.473, 483, 484, 485 Formal thermostability studies will be needed to assess whether such formulations would resist heat degradation and allow transport and storage outside the cold chain.",

The vaccinator or the patient holds against the skin a device, the Skin Preparation System (see Fig. 68.6G). With the push of a button and the pull of a tab, a controlled pressure is applied to a sandpaper strip, which gently abrades and removes approximately 25% of the stratum corneum.532 Then, a patch containing LT as antigen alone, or LT as an adjuvant for another antigen, is applied to the skin; the process is called transcutaneous immunization.534, 535, 536, 537 LT alone is intended to induce immunity against enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), the cause of traveler's diarrhea, or against Vibrio cholerae, with538 or without539, 540 ETEC colonization factor.",

At activation, electric pulses are induced to heat the filaments. An adhesive patch containing vaccine or therapeutic agent is then applied over the micropores just created. In a hairless mouse model, this technique elicited 10- to 100-fold greater cellular and humoral responses to an adenovirus vaccine than intact skin, as well as 100% protection to surrogate tumor challenge (27% for intact skin).377 In the same model, adenovirus-vectored melanoma antigen applied to the micropores roughly doubled the average onset time of tumors after challenge, and it protected one of six mice compared with none of eight vaccinated controls with intact skin. Microporated recombinant influenza H5 hemagglutinin protected BALB/c mice from challenge with a lethal H5N1 strain.557 Skin micropores also permitted the passage of insulin in pharmacokinetic human trials with historical controls, and in the other direction allowed interstitial fluid to be extracted for potential glucose monitoring.558\n",

Mucosal systems also dynamically move potential threats to limit the duration of exposure. For example, the ciliated epithelia of the upper and lower respiratory tract continually drive the mucus layer and its contents to the oropharynx to be swallowed and degraded by gastric acid. Peristalsis and other gastrointestinal mechanisms result in the eventual expulsion of gastrointestinal contents.

For nasal vaccines, another risk is that vaccine antigen (live or inactivated), adjuvant, or excipients might affect nearby cranial nerves574 or travel along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate into the brain, with resulting adverse nervous system effects. Vaccines targeting the lower airways may induce or exacerbate bronchospasm or pulmonary inflammation, which can be life threatening. Another risk is cross-contamination: respiratory pathogens from one patient may contaminate the respiratory immunization device and be spread to subsequent patients.575 Also, vaccine aerosols may spread beyond the intended recipient and affect other persons in the vicinity.",

OPV, a prototypical mucosal vaccine, demonstrates the key advantages and challenges of mucosal vaccination. The ease of delivery of OPV drops enables minimally trained volunteers to distribute it in house-to-house campaigns that have been essential for the current successes of the global polio eradication effort. OPV is a live attenuated vaccine, as are most successful mucosal vaccines to date. Vaccination results in increased mucosal immunity, particularly in the intestine, as evidenced by increased secretory IgA and decreased shedding of vaccine poliovirus on subsequent challenge compared with IPV given by injection (see Chapter 48). However, even minor shedding of vaccine virus can result in transmission of the vaccine virus to others. This is especially concerning because the vaccine virus has the potential for reversion to virulence, which can result in vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis in vaccinees and their contacts, and even in sustained outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses. Another concern regarding mucosal vaccine delivery demonstrated by OPV is the inconsistency of the immune response across different populations. OPV produces immunogenic responses less consistently in children in developing countries than in children in industrialized countries. This may be caused by differences in intestinal microbiota (see Chapter 48).",

Most of the new technologies for intestinal vaccination focus on microdelivery systems, which are reviewed in a separate section. One of the biggest hurdles to consistent delivery of vaccine antigen to APCs in the intestinal tract is ensuring that the antigen survives degradation from gastric acids. Like wild poliovirus, OPV is stable in acid environments for several hours. Other enteric vaccines, such as cholera and rotavirus vaccine, are delivered with a buffer solution to neutralize gastric acid.

Some oral surfaces, such as the hard palate, have a keratinized upper layer, while the epithelia of the buccal and SL mucosa are nonkeratinized.576 The lack of keratin increases permeability and potential for transportation of antigen to the mucosal APCs without the disruption or penetration of the stratum corneum required for cutaneous vaccination. As an example, Fig. 68.3G demonstrates wild-type measles virus replication in the oral mucosa. However, salivary and mucus flow rapidly moves substances on oral surfaces toward the pharynx to be swallowed and digested, and many salivary components initiate the processes of digestion and degradation. The oral cavity does not have organized lymphoid tissue such as the intestinal Peyer patches; however, movement of antigen across the pharyngeal tonsils may play a role in induction of an immune response.577 Unlike nasal delivery, oral delivery does not have the potential of exposing the cribriform plate to vaccine. Shim and colleagues reported that SL vaccination with a recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus expressing SARS-associated coronavirus antigen induced protective immunity against SARS-associated coronavirus comparable to that seen with IN vaccination. Adenoviral DNA was detected in the olfactory bulbs of the mice vaccinated intranasally, but not in those mice vaccinated sublingually.578\n",

Recumbent patient positioning may increase nasal residence time but may not be practical at all POCs.

In contrast, a number of obstacles must be overcome to produce vaccines as dry particles of sizes suitable for upper or lower respiratory tract deposition.601, 602, 603 First, formulating powders requires significant and extensive changes in manufacturing methods. Second, many potential dry-formulation ingredients are extremely hygroscopic and become sticky when exposed to humidity. Third, once the powders are deposited in the respiratory tract, they must be sufficiently hygroscopic to dissolve and release the vaccine for uptake. However, if these challenges can be met, dry aerosols have several advantages over liquid aerosols. Doses can be filled into inexpensive single-use presentations and delivered without on-site aqueous reconstitution. Secondary packaging that seals the dose container in an impermeable overwrap, such as metal foil, could maintain low humidity to prolong potency and increase shelf life. Minimal energy is required for powder dispersion compared with liquid droplet generation, so electromechanical devices are not necessary.",

Key advantages of AccuSpray delivery are that it is simple to use, low cost, capable of disposed without needing to use a sharps container, and has a low possibility of refill and reuse. The large particle sizes generated by the sprayer minimize deposition to the lower airways, reducing the risk of adverse pulmonary events. A limitation of the system is that the particle size emitted depends on the speed at which the vaccinator depresses the plunger. The median diameters of the particles can range from 200 \u00b5m or greater at plunger speeds of up to 33 mm per second to 50 \u00b5m or less at speeds of 80 mm per second and greater.614 Although this wide variability might in theory affect the efficiency of vaccine deposition, LAIV by AccuSpray typically produces a high rate of protective immunity at the current dosage.",

One study used a novel breath-actuated nasal spray device, OptiMist, which delivers liquid or dry powder aerosols only during oral exhalation. Because this method raises the soft palate to close the connection between nose and throat, pulmonary deposition is avoided and delivery to the posterior nasal segments is increased (see Fig. 68.7D).563 Inactivated influenza vaccine self-administered using the OptiMist resulted in significant increases in virus-specific IgA in nasal secretions, as well as protective levels of virus-specific serum antibodies, after two doses in more than 80% of subjects.622\n",

Although many dry powder and liquid-spray nasal devices are in use for drug delivery in humans, testing them in vaccine studies in animals is difficult or impossible because of the nostril size.",

Early clinical studies of drops or sprays delivered to the conjunctiva, or the oral or nasal mucosa, produced inconsistent immune responses,639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648 prompting researchers to consider aerosol pulmonary delivery. Albert Sabin was an early pioneer and advocate of this delivery method.649, 650, 651, 652 A significant body of clinical research in aerosol measles has been published and summarized in review articles and metaanalyses.653, 654, 655, 656 The primary finding is that delivery of nebulizer-generated small-particle liquid aerosols via pulmonary inhalation to children 10 months of age or older typically produced immune responses in very high proportions of subjects, usually equivalent to or greater than responses to injected vaccines.630, 631, 632, 640, 641, 642, 656, 657, 658, 659, 660, 661, 662, 663, 664, 665, 666, 667, 668, 669, 670, 671 For example, Dilraj and colleagues found that 96%, 94%, and 86% of schoolchildren who received the aerosol measles vaccine had antibody titers of greater than 300 IU/mL at 1, 2, and 6 years after vaccination, respectively, compared with 91%, 87%, and 73% among those receiving the injected vaccine.659, 669, 672 In contrast, generally lower immune responses were found for the aerosol route compared with parenteral injection, among children younger than 10 months.649, 650, 651, 652, 673, 674, 675 For example, Wong-Chew and coworkers found vaccination of 12- and 9-month-old infants by injection induced immunity in 100%, but by aerosol route in only 86% and 23%, respectively.673, 674 One hypothesis was that the very low respiratory volume of infants results in an inhaled dose of aerosol vaccine that is too small in that period. A follow-up study by Wong-Chew and colleagues demonstrated that increasing exposure time to aerosol measles vaccine elicits immune responses that are comparable to those seen by the SC route in 9-month-old infants.676\n",

The vaccine aerosol is delivered through reusable plastic tubing to a single-use disposable paper cone (modified from a drinking cup), which is held close to the patient's face for 30 seconds. Typically, the aerosolized dose volume is roughly 0.15 mL, and the mass median aerosol diameter of droplets is 4.3 \u00b5m.678 In a study that assessed the distribution of viable vaccine virus across the range of droplet sizes emitted from a Classic Mexican Device, Coates and coworkers estimated that 30% of infective viral particles were contained in droplets with diameters of 5 \u00b5m or less, and 23% were in droplets of greater than 10 \u00b5m. As with all vaccine delivery to the lower respiratory tract, it has not been possible to identify which target tissues are essential for production of an immune response. Although the Classic Mexican Device has demonstrated a level of safety and immunogenicity, it is heavy, cumbersome, and noisy, and it requires outlet (mains) electricity and crushed ice. It is thus not practical for routine vaccination.",

Its goal was licensure of at least one live attenuated measles vaccine and its associated aerosol delivery system in the developing world. The project documented immunogenicity and safety (i.e., the lack of local or systemic toxicity) in animal studies.629 Three existing therapeutic nebulizers were used for Phase I clinical trials: the AeroEclipse, the CompAIR, and the Aeroneb.679, 680 Measles vaccine delivery by the three devices, delivered to 145 subjects in India, was reported to be safe, well tolerated, and immunogenic.681 A modified version of the battery-operated Aeroneb vibrating mesh nebulizer (Aerogen) device (see Fig. 68.8C) was selected for use in the Phase II/III pivotal trial initiated in 2009 by the Measles Aerosol Project. The study was a randomized, open-label, active-control, noninferiority trial of the measles vaccine in unvaccinated healthy infants from 9 to 11.9 months of age. For aerosol delivery, vaccine was reconstituted in 2-mL diluent and administered as a single 0.2-mL dose, nebulized for 30 seconds through a single-use nonvented face mask. The nebulizer generated aerosol with a median diameter of 5.1 \u00b5m. In the full-analysis set, 673 (85.4%) of 788 children in the aerosol group and 754 (94.7%) of 796 children in the SC group were seropositive at day 91, a difference of 9.3 percentage points (95% confidence interval, 12.3 to 6.4), which failed to meet the predetermined 5% noninferiority margin. No serious adverse events were attributable to measles vaccination and adverse-event profiles were similar in the two groups.682\n",

Viruses and bacteria used as vaccine vectors should, ideally, have very low pathogenic potential, even in immunocompromised people, and they should have the capacity to incorporate the necessary foreign genes for desired antigens, promoters, and adjuvants. As vectors, bacteria have an advantage over viruses because of their higher capacity for insertion of heterologous genes expressing antigens, adjuvants, or plasmids (for DNA vaccination).

To encourage financing, a clear demand\u2014a willingness to pay\u2014must be expressed in advance by key stakeholders, including public health and immunization program policy makers, vaccine purchasers, and independent philanthropic entities. To create this demand, stakeholders must be aware of the potential of new technologies and convinced that the cost of developing practically ideal vaccines is outweighed by the benefit of reducing the long-term costs of current inefficiencies in the immunization system. In February 2014, the WHO held a meeting on Next-Generation Vaccine Delivery Technologies to conduct a rapid review of existing and future technologies, provide a vision for the future of vaccine technologies, and determine the strategic next steps to guide and enable the development, introduction, and uptake of new technologies with potential positive public health impact. Integrated products that would eliminate the need for reconstitution, provide improved thermostability, and offer needle-free delivery were all highlighted as priority technology development areas.713\n",
