A 2013 study by Sondhi and Devgan explored smartphone application in a paediatric ward. This study highlighted the effectiveness of smartphones with a wide range of applications including medical calculators (Qx, PICU calculator, Phototherapy calculator), drug information (Micromedex drug information, the Sanford guide to antimicrobial therapy), epidemiology (LearnStat) and medical news (MedPage). Additionally, the study indicates that such devices enable health care providers to connect with clinical information at the point of care, which ultimately provides patients with the best possible evidence-based practise. Of importance, the article suggests that mobile phone and smartphone use in the clinical setting can act as a source of distraction and potentially compromise the aseptic environment [17].",

It is likely that they constitute a suitable fomite, meaning an inanimate platform with microbial contamination.

We salute this initial steps of public awareness of such fomites but as trojan horses contaminated platforms, such awareness need to become a global decontamination campaign complementing handwashing. While the CDC advises at home sick individuals to follow manufacturer's instructions, they also advise, in case of no guidance, to use alcohol-based wipes containing at least 70% alcohol [82].
