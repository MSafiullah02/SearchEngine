            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) primarily cause multiple respiratory and intestinal infection in humans and animals [1]. Although the history of CoVs began in the 1940\u2019s 2, 3, the identification of first human CoVs were reported in the 1960\u2019s, as causative agents for mild respiratory infections. Subsequently they were named as (i) human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E) and (ii) HCoV-OC43 4, 5, 6. In the 1970\u2019s, the discovery of new viruses, studies about the mechanism of action as well as the replication and pathogenesis of CoVs were active among virologists. This led to discovery of another four new human coronaviruses, namely (iii) HCoV- Hong Kong University 1 (HKU1) 7, 8 (iv) HCoV-NL63, (v) severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and (vi) Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. The first four CoVs are universally circulated and contribute approximately one-third of common cold in humans [9]. However, in severe cases, they can cause life-threatening pneumonia and bronchiolitis in children and immunocompromised individuals 10, 11, 12 such as those undergoing chemotherapy and those with HIV-AIDS 13, 14, 15. Besides that, these four coronaviruses have been associated with enteric and neurological diseases 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. In 2003, SARS-CoV was identified as a causative agent during the global pandemic SARS. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the emergence by SARS-CoV had affected 8422 cases in 32 countries, 916 of which died with the fatality rate of 10-15% [21]. Following this outbreak, ten years after, another highly pathogenic coronavirus MERS-CoV epidemic surfaced in Middle Eastern countries in 2013 [22]. However, the major outbreak was happened in the Republic of Korea in 2015 [23]. The virus infection was majorly observed in adults, although it can affect any age of people [24]. Within a short time, the virus affected a total number of 1401 individuals, 543 of which died with the mortality of rate of \u223c39% worldwide, while in Saudi Arabia alone it was 37.5%[25].In the last two decades, there have been extensive studies on theses human coronaviruses, especially on SARS- and MERS-CoVs that led not only to understand coronaviruses biology but has also driven the discovery of new therapeutics for in case if any future outbreaks. In this review, we focus on the recent development of inhibitors targeting coronaviruses.",

The Coronavirinae subfamily is further classified into four main genera: \u03b1-coronavirus, \u03b2-coronavirus, \u03b3-coronavirus and \u03b4-coronavirus based on the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses (Fig. 1). HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL6 belong to \u03b1-coronavirus, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-OC43 are \u03b2-coronaviruses, and they both infect only mammals. \u03b3-Coronavirus and \u03b4-coronavirus infect birds, but some of them can also infect mammals [27]. Based on current sequence databases, it has been discovered that all human CoVs have animal origins; SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E are considered to have originated in bats; HCoV-OC43 and HKU1N are likely originated from rodents 28, 29.",

The genomic RNA, which acts as a messenger RNA (mRNA), plays an important role in the initial RNA synthesis of the infectious cycle, template for replication and transcription and as a substrate for packaging into the progeny virus. In all CoVs, 5\u2019 two-thirds of the genome encodes a replicase polyproteins, pp1ab, which comprises of two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b. These ORFs are then processed by viral proteases to cleave into 16 non-structural proteins that are involved in genome transcription and replication. The 3' terminus encodes CoV canonical set of four structural proteins; including (i) the nucleocapsid (N) protein, a basic RNA-binding protein, (ii) a spike protein (S), a type of glycoprotein I, (ii) a membrane protein (M) that spans the membrane, and (iii) an envelope protein (E), a highly hydrophobic protein that covers the entire structure of the coronavirus [31] (Fig. 2\n). These accessory proteins are not only important for virion assembly but may also have an additional link that they suppress the host immune response to facilitate viral replication.",

Subsequently, these polyproteins are cleaved into at least 15 non-structural proteins (nsp), which assembles and form the replication-transcription complex. With the aid of replicases, the full-length positive strand of genomic RNA is transcribed to form a full-length negative-strand template for the synthesis of new genomic RNAs.

The use of the corticosteroid, methylprednisolone (3, Fig. 3) as a therapeutic intervention for SARS patients was associated with an increased 30-day mortality rate (adjusted OR = 26.0, 95% CI = 4.4\u2013154.8). However, disseminated fungal infection and avascular osteonecrosis occurred following the prolonged systemic corticosteroid therapy 57, 58, 59. A randomized, placebo-controlled study showed that plasma SARS-CoV RNA levels in weeks 2-3 of the illness were higher in patients given hydrocortisone (n = 10) than those given normal saline (n = 7) in the early phase of the illness, suggesting that early use of pulsed methylprednisolone (3) might prolong viremia. In the case of patients with MERS, the combination of ritonavir (2) + interferon \u03b12a or interferon \u03b1-2b resulted in no significant effect on clinical outcome; case-control study showed significantly improved survival (14 out of 20 and 7 out of 24 in the treated and control groups, respectively; P = 0.004) at 14 days, but not at 28 days 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.",

They all were able to inhibit the replication of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV as well as HCoV-229E in the low micromolar range, which suggest that they could be used for the broad spectral anti-viral activity. As a mode of action, 7 inhibited the replication of MERS-CoV in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 3.0 \u03bcM and the inhibition contributed to the blockade of the virus at a very early stage. Compound 7 was previously reported as an effective anti-viral agent against flavivirus, influenza virus, HIV [66], Ebola virus [67], and Nipha-Hendra virus [68]. Chlorpromazine (8) was another hit compound resulted from the screening and inhibited the replication of MERS-CoV with an EC50 of 4.9 \u03bcM. Chlorpromazine (8) is the first antipsychotic drug developed for the treatment of schizophrenia [69] and mechanistically it inhibited the clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It has also been reported to inhibit the replication of hepatic C virus [70] (HCV), alphavirus [71], mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-2) [72] and other coronavirus SARS-CoV [73]. The mechanistic study of chlorpromazine (8) on MERS-CoV indicated that it inhibited the virus at both an early and postentry stage, suggesting that an effect on clathrin-mediated endocytosis was not only the sole antiviral mechanism. Loperamide (9), an antidiarrheal opioid receptor agonist, which reduces intestinal motility [74], inhibited the replication of MERS-CoV. Additionally, it inhibited the other two coronaviruses in the low micromolar range (4 to 6 \u03bcM). Lopinavir (10) is an anti-HIV protease inhibitor, which also inhibited the replication of MERS-CoV with an EC50 of 8.0 \u03bcM. It was previously reported to inhibit the SARS-CoV main protease (Mpro) [75] and therefore, it was presumed that it might also target the Mpro of MERS-CoV.",

An in vitro study of the anti-viral effect of saracatinib (14) [found to suppress the early stages of the MERS-CoV life cycle in Huh-7 cells through a possible suppression of the SFK signaling pathways. Interestingly, co-treatment of saracatinib (14) with gemcitabine, a deoxycytidine analog that is commonly used for the treatment of cancers 77, 78 showed a synergistic anti-viral effect with a minimal cytotoxic effect.

Antidiarrheal agent loperamide (9), or anti-HIV-1 agent lopinavir (10) were able to inhibit both MERS-and SARS-CoVs infection in the low-micromolar range and was linear with the study by de Wilde et al.\n[79]. Antiparasitics, mefloquine (20), and amodiaquine dihydrochloride (21) or antibacterial, emetine dihydrochloride hydrate (19) in which that function was not linked to coronaviruses in general, showed antiviral activity against both CoVs. Cathepsins are important for the fusion step during virus entry of coronavirus [80]. Cathepsin inhibitor, E-64-D (22), blocked the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV at the entry stage. The neurotransmitter inhibitor triflupromazine (33) inhibited both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In addition to that, other neurotransmitters fluphenazine (29) and promethazine (30) were reported to inhibit MERS-CoVs protein-mediated cell-cell fusion with IC50 values of about 20 and 29 \u03bcM, respectively [81]. Kinase signaling pathway inhibitors imatinib mesylate (35) and dasatinib (36) are known inhibitors of the Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog-1 pathway (ABL-1) and were active against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The data suggest that the ABL-1 pathway may be important for the viral replication and inhibitors of this pathway may have the potential in the discovery of antiviral agents.",

However, a subsequent study in a non-human primate model did not provide a positive result as the treatment of MERS-CoV infected common marmosets with mycophenolic acid had a worse outcome than untreated animals did [84].",

Therefore, targeting proteases has become an attractive approach for developing potential antiviral drugs. Protease inhibitors block the replication of coronaviruses (CoVs), including the causative agents of MERS and SARS infection. The papain-like protease (PLpro) and a 3C-like protease (3CLpro also known as the main protease) are important two proteases that mediate the process replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1b. PLpro is a cysteine protease that uses the thiol group of cysteine as a nucleophile to attack the carbonyl group of the scissile peptide bond for cleavage at first three positions of its polyprotein to produce three nonstructural proteins, while 3CLpro cleaves the remaining 11 locations, releasing non-structural proteins from nsp4 to nsp16. As a result, sequence motifs recognized by MERS-CoV PLpro and SARS-CoV PLpro are (L/I)XGG\u2193(A/D)X and LXGG\u2193(A/K)X, respectively (Fig. 6\n).",

It was found to be highly effective against both infections with EC50 values of 1.3 nM and 3 nM, respectively. For MERS-CoV, the potent antiviral activities of silvestrol were also confirmed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as a second type of human primary cells.

This was supported by the recent X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV PLpro complex with the lead inhibitors 50 and 51. These structures revealed that inhibitors did not bind to the catalytic site of SARS CoV PLpro but to the BL2 loop, which appears to prevent the accessibility of substrate to the active site, and thereby inhibiting the enzymatic activity. Structural and sequence analysis at BL2 loop of SARS-CoV PLproand MERS CoV PLpro suggested that they both have a difference in key amino acid residues that are responsible for inhibitor binding. For example, Y269 and Q270 are responsible for inhibitor binding in SARS-CoV PLpro, whereas T274 and A275 in MERS CoV PLpro. These findings suggest that making dual inhibitors targeting PLpro of SARS-and MERS-CoVs is difficult.",

In particular, the isolated compounds exerted significant SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitory activity through noncompetitive inhibition. Compounds 53 and 54, showed the most potent PLpro inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 9.2 and 3.7, respectively. Additionally, they performed detailed protein-inhibitor SPR-binding analyses of compound 54 with SARS-CoV PLpro. Compound 54 strongly inhibited the cleavage of both ubiquitin and ISG15 (IC50 values of 7.6 and 8.5 \u03bcM, respectively).",

The study was extended to find out the novel inhibitors that interact at S3 to S4 site [119].

The resulting analogs have Ac-Thr-Gly-OH (compound 81,\nFig. 11), instead of an original Ac-Thr-Val sequence in 75, since an isopropyl side chain of the Val in 75 is directed to an outward of SARS 3CLpro and no interactions with SARS 3CLpro at the Val site is detected. Indeed the compound showed about 2.4 times potent inhibitory activities for SARS 3CLpro when combined with a non-prime site substituent.

            "text": "Several nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors have broad-spectrum activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitors such as ribavirin and mycophenolic acid inhibit an important step in de novo synthesis of nucleic acids (discussed earlier). Mizoribine, another IMPDH also proved to inhibit the synthesis of nucleic acids. Mizoribine (109, Fig. 14\n), an approved immunosuppressant in organ transplantation with limited adverse side effects, has shown in vitro activity against HCV and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and was considered as an alternative to ribavirin/IFN combinations for treatment of HCV infections [169] Mizoribine exerts its activity through selective inhibition of inosine monophosphate synthetase and guanosine monophosphate synthetase, resulting in the complete inhibition of guanine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into nucleotides. The chemotherapeutic gemcitabine has shown in vitro activity against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (discussed earlier). Remdesivir (development code GS-5734, or 110, Fig. 12) is an antiviral drug, a novel nucleotide analog prodrug. It was developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections, though it has subsequently also been found to show reasonable antiviral activity against more distantly related viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, Junin virus, Lassa fever virus, and MERS-coronavirus [170]. Remdesivir was rapidly pushed through clinical trials due to the 2013\u20132016 West African Ebola virus epidemic crisis, eventually being used in at least one human patient despite its early development stage at the time. Preliminary results were promising and it was used in the emergency setting for the 2018 Kivu Ebola outbreak along with further clinical trials.",

In contrast, to control animals, which all succumbed to the infection, all remdesivir-treated animals survived the lethal challenge, indicating that remdesivir represents a promising antiviral treatment for Nipah virus infection also [171].",
