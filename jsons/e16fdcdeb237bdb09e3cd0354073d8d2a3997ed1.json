For example, according to data of the American Academy of Ophthalmology, an ophthalmologist working in Wuhan contracted the virus from an asymptomatic glaucoma patient in January 2020.

Conjunctival swab samples from one patient showed positive RT-PCR result, while two patients yielded probable positive RT-PCR result. None of the patients showed ocular symptoms. The only one patient with conjunctivitis as the first symptom had negative conjunctival sac test for SARS-CoV-2. Although the authors suspected the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through conjunctiva is extremely low, the nosocomial infection after occupational exposure is a possible route [5] . However, all these results are based on a small number of patients, therefore further studies are needed to confirm this observation and evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on eyes [3] [4] [5] .",
