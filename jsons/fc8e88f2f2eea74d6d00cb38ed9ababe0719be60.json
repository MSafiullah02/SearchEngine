            "text": "Many lessons for procedural choice have been provided by axiomatic studies of decision procedures. However, there appears to be a gap between these axiomatic studies and the actual determination of appropriate procedures, as an axiomatic characterization does not directly answer which axiom should be appropriate-particularly when there is no agreement on the relative desirability of criteria. The present study proposes a formal model of procedural choice based on preferences over criteria (PCBPC). Specifically, we focus on the aggregation rule that maps a dichotomous preference profile over criteria for decision procedures to a nonempty set of decision procedures. We prove that the counting rule, which chooses the decision procedures with greatest supports, is the unique aggregation rule that satisfies anonymity (A), neutrality (N), strict monotonicity (SM), and partition consistency (PC), where PC is proposed based on the idea that representations of equivalent criteria in different ways should not affect the results. Two distinct standpoints for PCBPC are highlighted: one is to regard criteria as atomic, i.e., inseparable, objects and the other as composite, i.e., separable, objects. The difference between them is made explicit with two impossibility theorems showing the inconsistency between unanimity in the former standpoint and A (or PC) in the latter standpoint.",

            "text": "This observation implies the necessity of a decision support system that deals with voters' preferences over criteria. To this end, the present paper provides a formal model for procedural choice based on preferences over criteria (PCBPC) . Although each of the axiomatic studies has provided the justifications for particular axioms, Nurmi [1] was the first to study the system for PCBPC (see also de Almeida et al. [2] ; application of this method for business contexts is found in de Almeida and Nurmi [3] ). Based on the performance matrix of voting rules (Table 1) , Nurmi [1] proposes two different methods to create collective rankings/choices of voting rules based on the voters' preferences over criteria. One method is to first determine the rankings of criteria with an ordinary decision procedure (e.g., Borda's or Kemeny's rule) and then determine the rankings of decision procedures (p. 247-248 in Nurmi [1] ). The other method is to determine the rankings of decision procedures directly using MCDM methods (p. 250-251 in Nurmi [1] ). As Nurmi points out, these methods are designed for situations where voters have linear preferences over criteria and some other methods can be used instead. The present study first aims to provide a formal model for PCBPC in order to make clear the foundations and implicit assumptions of PCBPC. Next, we characterize the counting rule which chooses those decision procedures with the greatest support when voters have dichotomous preferences over criteria. Table 1 . Whether a SCR satisfies a given criterion (1) or not (0) (from de Almeida et al. Let us review the literature related to procedural choice. Some authors study the desirable way of procedural choice when the preferences over decision procedures are consequentially induced from the preferences over alternatives (Rae [4] ; Koray [5] ; Barbera and Jackson [6] ; Suzuki and Horita [7] ). Others begin with the preferences over decision procedures (Dietrich [8] ; Diss and Merlin [9] ). Compared with these studies, PCBPC is new in that it is based on the preferences over criteria.",

The most essential difference is in the logical relationships between criteria, i.e., some sets of criteria are consistent, but others are not. As is well known, Arrow [10] 's impossibility theorem says that Pareto, independence of irrelevant alternatives, and non-dictatorship reach a contradiction in the design of social welfare functions (with universal domains). Therefore, to approve of all three criteria equally is logically impossible even though the society members may unanimously agree about them all. On the other hand, the combination of anonymity, neutrality, and positive responsiveness is consistent (May [11] ) and so these three can be approved simultaneously. This implies that unsatisfactory results can happen if the two steps are independently determined. In other words, the set of admissible collective judgments of criteria should be restricted by the logical relationships of decision procedures at hand. In order to make matters simple, our model assumes that the PCBPC method returns the collective choices on decision procedures directly from the set of preference profiles over criteria (and not via the collective judgments of criteria).",

            "text": "(1) Roughly speaking, Assumption 4 means that the names of the criteria do not matter. Let us explain why. According to Assumption 4, the PCBPC method looks at not the criterion C itself but F C . In the choices of Copeland and Dodgson, for example, there is supposed to be no difference between criteria b and d in Table 1 because for the two voting rules, satisfying b is equivalent to satisfying d. In this example, Assumption 4 demands that \"a voter approves criterion b\" is equivalent to \"a voter approves criterion d\". The point is that Copeland is supported by one reason, no matter which of b or d is approved. In this sense, Assumption 4 is an axiom that treats equivalent criteria equally. (2) It is also noteworthy that the meaning of a criterion C is measured within the set of feasible decision procedures F . Consequently, the \"same\" criterion, say Condorcet winner criterion (CW), may be translated into different sets if different F 's are given: for instance, F CW \u00bc F when F is made up of amendment, Copeland, and Dodgson, while F 0 CW \u00bc / if F 0 is made up of plurality, Borda, and approval (see Table 1 ). The difference reflects the logical strength of CW in the two cases (CW is extremely weak in the former case and extremely strong in the latter).",

One of the most famous cases is that the combination of Pareto, independence of irrelevant alternatives, and non-dictatorship (as well as unrestricted domain) is found to be consistent if social decision functions are considered (Sen [12] ).

As in Dietrich's view, the use of anonymity and neutrality may be justified on the grounds that procedural choice is made only by the judgments within the decision body.
