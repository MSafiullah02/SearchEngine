IBV can cause a highly contagious disease that affects the reproductive, respiratory, and renal systems of chickens and results in great economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide (Cavanagh, 2007; Worthington, et al., 2008; Cook, et al., 2012). IBV replicates in various chicken tissues and directly or indirectly causes various lesions and clinical signs, such as watery feces, tracheal rales, nephritis, dyspnea (Cavanagh, 2003). Respiratory and urinary system symptoms are common in IBV infection, and nephropathogenic strains of IBV pathotypes cause nephritis. In young chickens, severe respiratory distress may occur, and varying degrees of respiratory distress, decreases in egg production, and the loss of the internal and shell qualities of eggs have been reported. A previous study identified nephropathogenic strains of IBV that cause infection. Some strains of the virus can cause severe kidney damage, urolithiasis and high mortality (Cook, et al., 2001; Ziegler, et al., 2002). Infectious bronchitis (IB) has become a major health problem that affects the chicken industry in most countries of the world.",

However, nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (NIBV) has become an important factor of visceral gout (Bayry, et al., 2005). Previous studies have reported that NIBV can cause kidney damage and secondary gout (Gaba et al., 2010; Ziegler, et al. 2002). Early physiological studies documented the changes in water metabolism that are observed in the excreta of young male broiler chickens, and challenge with NIBV causes significant increases in the fractional excretions of sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), potassium (P), and plasma uric acid (Afanador and Roberts, 1994). Abdel-Moneim et al. reported severe congestion of the liver, spleen and lungs in birds that had died after experimental IBV infection (Abdel-Moneim, et al., 2009).",

Most of the previous molecular tests for IBV have been applied to the detection of IBV in kidney, trachea, or cloacal swabs from chickens rather than embryonic chickens. In addition, embryonated chicken eggs were used to study several poultry pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi (Jacobsen, et al., 2010; Montgomery, et al., 2005) and were suggested as an alternative model for vaccine production (Abdul Hafeez, et al., 2006). The pathogenesis and virulence of clostridium perfringens and eimeriatenella was also studied after experimental infection (Alnassan, et al., 2013). At present, there is no in embryonic chicken described for the investigation of NIBV infection.",

In the studies of Wideman and Cowen (Wideman and Cowen, 1987), Gray-strain IBV decreases the relative kidney weight ratio. In our study, The EE ratios were significantly lower in the infected group than in the control group, and the HSI and KSI were significantly higher in the infected group than the control group. These findings indicate that challenge with NIBV decreased the body weight and induced liver and kidney swelling and hypertrophy. Our results also supported those of a previous study that observed nephritis in non-vaccinated flocks that was characterized by enlarged and pale kidneys, frequent urate deposits in the kidneys, severe dehydration, and weight loss, and typical signs, including embryo dwarfing and death, in embryos that were observed in different passages after challenge (Liu and Kong, 2004; Ziegler, et al., 2002). In the present study, the changes in embryo body weight, HSI and KSI reflected impaired development and liver and kidney damage following NIBV infection.",

            "text": "There are several electrolytes in the chicken body, and each performs a vital role. Balances of P, Cl, K, Na, Ca, and Mg are required for normal cellular metabolism and the maintenance of the physiological functions of the organs. However, neural-humoral regulation may affect the body fluids to ensure embryonic chicken health and prevent conditions that may result from fluid and electrolyte imbalances (Levy, et al., 1990; McLafferty, et al., 2014). In our study, the embryonic chickens infected with NIBV exhibited significant increases in the concentrations of Na and Cl at 3 dpi and significant increases in plasma K concentrations at 3 and 5 dpi. These results were likely due to NIBV infection-induced kidney damage and chronic glomerulonephritis in the chicken embryos (Afanador and Roberts, 1994; Cong, et al., 2013; Wideman, et al., 1983) that led to the simultaneous retention of Na, Cl, and water and acute intravascular hemolysis that caused intracellular K influx in the blood and induced hyperkalemia due to kidney tissue damage (Dote, et al., 2007; Hahn and Hahn, 2015). However, Crawford et al. reported that magnesium is the second most common intracellular cation after potassium and that approximately one-third of the magnesium in the extracellular fluid is bound to protein (albumin), while the remaining two-thirds are free (ionized). It is the ionized portion that is largely involved with the composition of bone and the metabolisms of several enzyme cofactors (Crawford and Harris, 2011). Our experiment suggests that the plasma Mg concentration in the infected group was significantly higher than that in the control group at 3 dpi. These results are likely due to the dysostosis caused by NIBV, and NIBV result in tissue cell injuries that lead to reductions in the syntheses of metabolic enzymes, which in turn leads to a decrease in the reabsorption of magnesium. The Ca and P levels in the control group were uniformly and significantly lower than those in the infected group at 3 and 5 dpi. For this reason, approximately 99% of the Ca and 80% of the P in the body exist in the skeleton (Zelenka, 2012). The dynamic distributions of the electrolytes Ca and P in the blood exhibited significant increases in the virus group likely because the maintenance of Ca and P is essential for forming the skeleton during the process of embryonic chicken growth. In the infected group, embryo development was blocked, and dysostosis resulted in the reduced absorption of Ca and P in the plasma. In conclusion, the infection of embryonic chickens with NIBV may result in the observed disturbances in plasma electrolytes.",

The most common of several parameters of kidney function that are examined include the plasma concentrations of UA, BUN, and CR. Increased plasma BUN, CR, and UA levels have been reported to be markers of renal functional impairment in several previous studies (Duru, et al., 2008; Lumeij and Remple, 1991). Plasma UA levels are related to nephrotoxicity and kidney injury in broiler chickens (Kanbay, et al., 2010; Kanda, et al., 2015). We also found that plasma BUN, CR, and UA levels were significantly higher following NIBV administrations compared with the control group and resulted in kidney damage.",

            "text": "The liver plays a central role in the metabolism and excretion of xenobiotics, and thus the liver is highly susceptible to the adverse and toxic effects of these agents. A noticeable indication of hepatic damage is the leakage of cellular enzymes into the plasma (Giannini, et al., 2005). The estimation of plasma marker enzymes is useful for quantitative evaluations of the extent and type of hepatocellular damage in chickens (Giannini, Testa and Savarino, 2005; Kemal., et al., 2003). When the plasma membrane of a hepatocyte is injured, a variety of cytoplasmic enzymes are released into the circulation, and thus the enzyme levels in the plasma are increased. ALT, AST, and ALP in the plasma serve as indicators of liver function (Jaensch, et al., 2000). In our study, the plasma ALT, AST, and ALP levels in the infected group were significantly greater than those in the control group across the entire experimental period. We believe that NIBV infection caused liver damage in the embryonic chickens. These findings are in agreement with the severe congestion of the liver, spleen and lungs of birds that have died following experimental IBV infection (Abdel-Moneim, Zlotowski, Veits, Keil and Teifke, 2009). AST exists mainly in the hepatocellular mitochondria, and when damage or severe necrosis of the liver occurs, only the plasma AST concentration is elevated. The plasma GGT levels of the infected group did not differ significantly from those of the control group at 1 dpi but were significantly higher than the control group at 3 and 5 dpi. This pattern was observed because in the embryonic stages, GGT exists mainly in the intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells and hepatic cytoplasm, and the development of the intrahepatic bile ducts in embryonic chickens is incomplete at 14 days old (at 1 dpi). Existing research has demonstrated that the concentrations of TP, ALB, and GLB in the plasma serve as indicators of liver function (Bernet, et al., 2001). TP includes both ALB and GLB. Changes in the levels of these parameters may explain the hypofunctioning of the hepatocytes after NIBV infections. GLB is related to immunity. ALB is made in the liver, and when the liver is damaged, ALB levels decrease (Toro, et al., 1997). Additionally, in our study, the liver TP, ALB, and GLB activities in the infected group were significantly lower than those in the control group. This pattern was observed because embryonic chickens infected with NIBV exhibit damage and functional lesions of the liver, and the synthesis of proteins is consequently reduced. In the present study, the changes in the plasma indicators reflected the liver damage that occurred after NIBV infection.",

In the infected group, NIBV was detected in the liver and kidney, which indicated that the chicken embryos had been infected with NIBV. These findings are in agreement with the IBV antigens were detected in the liver, kidney trachea, and lung of the birds tissues following experimental IBV infection. In our study, the highest detected levels occurred in the liver and kidney in the infected group. Based on separate analyses of the liver and kidney tissues, the amount of viral RNA in the liver peaked at 3 dpi, which indicated that the liver function of the embryonic chickens was most strongly influenced by NIBV infection at 3 dpi. Subsequently, the liver (along with many other vital organs) was exposed to danger. Due to stress and the lack of proper and steady nutrients, the liver can become prone to infection, malfunction, and jaundice and even cease to function. These findings agree with the above results of liver function, which revealed that the changes in liver function indicators reflected the most serious liver damage at 3 dpi. The amounts of RNA detected in the kidney were highest in the virus group, and the levels of RNA in the liver were lower than those in the kidney throughout the experiment. This pattern was observed because IBV strains vary greatly in terms of tissue tropism. NIBV peaked in the kidney at 3 dpi, and the viral load was significantly higher for kidney than for liver, which indicates that the kidney may be an important target of NIBV infection. The amounts of viral RNA in the kidney peaked at 3 dpi, which indicated that the embryonic chickens infected with NIBV exhibited the most severe kidney damage at 3 dpi. These findings are consistent with the functional kidney results. In the present study, liver and kidney damage were strongly related to the viral RNA levels in the tissues.",
