The Leishmania Oligo-Strip is dipped into the solution, and test results are read after a 10-min migration at 55\u00b0C (4). During migration, the solution takes up the impregnated probes: the gold-labeled detection probe (5) hybridizes with both types of amplicons, while the biotinylated Leishmania capture probe on the test side (6) and the biotinylated IC capture probe on the control side (7) hybridize with their respective amplicons.

The IC line and the migration control lines determine whether the test is valid or invalid. An invisible migration control line indicates an invalid detection step, while an invalid PCR is indicated by a negative IC line in combination with a negative test line. The latter is possibly due to inhibitory factors in the extracted DNA. When a sample contains high concentrations of Leishmania DNA, competition between the Leishmania DNA and the IC template DNA during PCR can result in an invisible IC control line combined with a strongly visible Leishmania test line. In this case, the test is considered valid.

This finding is similar to the observed sensitivities of other PCR assays reviewed by Vega-L\u00f3pez [8] . Direct microscopy of the lesion showed a lower sensitivity (78.8%). The lack of a positive PCR result in some of the confirmed CL and MCL lesion samples might be explained by (1) heterogeneity in parasite distribution in the lesion, (2) delay between sample collection and testing, or (3) false-positive microscopic results caused by staining artifacts. This is supported by the fact that 3 of the 4 Leishmania OligoC-TesT negative samples were also negative in a second PCR analysis performed in Peru targeting the Leishmania kinetoplast DNA [28] (authors' unpublished data). Leishmania DNA could be detected in all lesion scrapings, which is encouraging, because this offers a less invasive sampling procedure compared with biopsy punctures. The higher sensitivity for lesion scrapings can be explained by the lower amount of PCR-inhibiting factors. This is confirmed by the observation of Garcia et al. [29] , who reported a higher sensitivity of PCR for lesion scrapings than for biopsy specimens in 44 Bolivian patients with CL or MCL. The similar sensitivities of our method for CL and MCL samples is encouraging, considering the generally low parasite load in the latter. The sensitivity of 86% in blood from patients with confirmed VL is promising and suggests that the OligoC-TesT can contribute significantly to less invasive VL diagnosis. Patients with clinically suspected infection who have positive serologic results and positive Leishmania OligoC-TesT results in blood might not need to undergo the invasive bone marrow or spleen sampling. Previous PCR studies found the same range of sensitivity in blood [9, 30] . The lower sensitivity of the test in blood samples from Sudan (77.8%) versus those from Kenya (92%) could be due to bias in parasite load or experimental differences during DNA extraction. Further evaluations with different types of extraction methods might be recommended. Despite the low number of available lymph node samples, the observation that all of them showed positive Leishmania OligoC-TesT results is encouraging. Indeed, if molecular diagnosis in lymph nodes proves to have high sensitivity, this would be a major step forward in the search for a noninvasive method for diagnosing VL.

Presentation of the Leishmania OligoC-TesT as a self-containing kit with a ready-to-use PCR mix and dipsticks will allow quality control and standardization. However, sampling and DNA extraction are also important steps for accurate molecular diagnosis and need to be standardized.

Furthermore, a multicentric study in which different PCR methods are evaluated on the same samples would be highly valuable. In addition, a standardized oligochromatographic format for identification of Leishmania species would be welcome, given the high importance of accurate species identification in patient management, disease control, and epidemiological studies. Recently, a first prototype to discriminate between L. infantum and L. donovani by means of the oligochromatographic approach has been developed (T. Laurent, G.V.d.A., M. Hide, et al., unpublished data).

The detection limit of the assay was evaluated with a 10-fold serial dilution of L. donovani DNA in water containing 0.1 mg/mL acetylated bovine serum albumin.

This indicates a diagnostic specificity of 98.3%, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) (scored by Wilson's method [22]) of 91.1%-99.7 %.

The Leishmania OligoC-TesT had positive results in 33 of the 36 biopsy samples from patients with CL, all 8 lesion scrapings from patients with CL, and 11 of the 12 aspirate samples from patients with MCL(table 1). Hence, the sensitivity of the Leishmania OligoC-TesT in the 56 clinical samples from patients with CL or MCL was 92.9% (95% CI, 83.0%-97.2%), higher than the sensitivity of microscopy for the same samples. Results of microscopy were available for 52 samples and were positive in 41; thus, the sensitivity of microscopy was 78.8% (95% CI, 66%-87.8%). Test results were negative in all 8 dental biopsy specimens from healthy endemic control subjects.A positive Leishmania OligoC-TesT result was observed in 23 of the 25 (92% [95% CI, 75.0%-97.8%]) and 14 of the 18 (77.8% [95% CI, 54.8%-91.0%]) blood samples from patients with confirmed VL from Kenya and Sudan, respectively. Eleven of the 12 bone marrow samples and all 6 lymph node samples from Sudanese patients with confirmed VL were positive in the assay. Leishmania DNA was detected in 1 of the 18 and 1 of the 19 blood samples from healthy control subjects in Kenya and Sudan, respectively.
