Further, the crystal structure of CA4\u2010tubulin complex has been determined and this indicates CA4 to have common as well as different interactions to colchicine within the binding site.26 In this analysis,26 the trimethoxy aryl ring was found to reside in a hydrophobic region containing Ala250, Cys241, Leu255, Asp354, and Ala316, and the hydroxyl group was hydrogen\u2010bonded to Val181 and Thr179. By comparison to colchicine, CA4 was deeper in the hydrophobic pocket and the hydroxyl group of colchicine was bonded to only Val181. Further, binding of CA4 did not significantly alter the structure of tubulin.",

Spurred by the importance of both coumarins and CA4, we decided to explore the synthesis and bioactivities of a class of compounds we dub 1,4\u2010triazolyl combretacoumarins. There are, of course, isomeric 1,4\u2010 and 1,5\u2010combretacoumarins (Figure 2). Among the two, the latter class, which would be equivalent to (Z)\u2010CA4, could be quite interesting due to the proximal disposition of two aryl rings and, in this context, 1,5\u2010triazolyl combretastatin analogs have been prepared.33 In the present case, synthesis of this regioisomer would require reaction of a magnesiated alkyne with an azide,34 but the organometallic reagent would be incompatible with the coumarin. Use of Ru\u2010catalysis is known to yield 1,5\u2010disubstituted 1,2,3\u2010triazoles,35 but this was unproductive in the present study (see the Supporting Information). On the basis of these considerations, we describe the synthesis and evaluations of 1,4\u2010combretacoumarins, which are structurally closer to (E)\u2010CA4.",

Stock solutions of each compound were prepared at their highest soluble concentration in DMSO (Table 4).

CC50 values were determined by linear interpolation of the two concentrations with cell death nearest the 50% mark.",

            "text": "In summary, in this work, we have demonstrated a simple and facile two\u2010step, one\u2010pot conversion of 4\u2010hydroxycoumarins to the corresponding 4\u2010azido derivatives. This involves activation of the 4\u2010hydroxyl group with BOP and DBU in MeCN. The intermediate O\n4\u2010(benzotriazolyl)coumarin derivatives formed in situ, possibly via the intermediacy of a phosphonium ion, can be reacted with NaN3 and 18\u2010crown\u20106 to give the 4\u2010azidocoumarins. These products were subjected to CuAAC reactions with 5\u2010ethynyl\u20101,2,3\u2010trimethoxybenzene using [(MeCN)4Cu]PF6 in CH2Cl2/MeOH, and 2,6\u2010lutidine as additive, at 50 oC. Critical to the success of these reactions was the need for both MeOH and 2,6\u2010lutidine. Using these conditions, seven 1,4\u2010combretacoumarins and one phenyl derivative, 1\u2010phenyl\u20104\u2010(3,4,5\u2010trimethoxyphenyl)\u20101H\u20101,2,3\u2010triazole, were synthesized. The latter was prepared in order to compare the reactivities of the 4\u2010azidocoumarins with PhN3. Interestingly, although the azidocoumarins required an elevated temperature to attain complete reactions, PhN3 reacted at room temperature and within a shorter reaction time. To understand possible reasons for this difference in reactivities, DFT computations were utilized to evaluate the NBO coefficients of the azido groups in the 4\u2010azidocoumarins but a link between the NBO coefficients on the nitrogen atoms of the azido groups and reactivity was not forthcoming. However, a difference was observed between the azido coumarins and PhN3. Four desmethoxy 1,4\u2010combretacoumarins were prepared from reactions of 4\u2010azido\u20106\u2010bromo\u20102H\u2010chromen\u20102\u2010one (6) with two di\u2010 and two mono\u2010methoxy phenylacetylenes. In these reactions, we found that the structures of the phenylacetylenes also influence the CuAAC reactions, and DFT computations were used to assess the NBO coefficients of the alkynyl carbon atoms. As anticipated, the terminal alkynyl carbon atom has a greater negative charge when a p\u2010methoxy group is present. The varying electronic properties of the alkynes are likely also linked to the subtle reactivity differences observed. Antiproliferative and antiviral assays were undertaken. Unfortunately, the 1,4\u2010combretacoumarins suffered from solubility problems. Among the various compounds, 1\u2010phenyl\u20104\u2010(3,4,5\u2010trimethoxyphenyl)\u20101H\u20101,2,3\u2010triazole (20) was relatively soluble and showed antiproliferative effect, appearing to operate via an apoptotic pathway due to significant phosphotidylserine (PS) externalization. Three of the four desmethoxy compounds showed comparable cytotoxicity against CEM cells. Of these, 6\u2010bromo\u20104\u2010(4\u2010(4\u2010methoxyphenyl)\u20101H\u20101,2,3\u2010triazol\u20101\u2010yl)\u20102H\u2010chromen\u20102\u2010one (23) was also selective for MB\u2010231 cells. However, this compound did not demonstrate appreciable PS externalization, in contrast to 1\u2010phenyl\u20104\u2010(3,4,5\u2010trimethoxyphenyl)\u20101H\u20101,2,3\u2010triazole (20).

Compounds were purified by column chromatography on 200\u2013300 silica gel mesh. All other reagents were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. 1H NMR spectra were obtained at 500 MHz in CDCl3 and are referenced to the residual CHCl3. 13C NMR spectra were obtained at 125 MHz in [D6]DMSO, CDCl3, or CD2Cl2 (see details under specific compound headings), and are referenced to the resonance of the solvent (\u03b4 = 39.51, 77.23, and 54.00 ppm, respectively).

The aqueous layer was separated and back extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 \u00d7). The combined organic layer was dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated under reduced pressure. Purification was performed by column chromatography on a silica gel column (see individual compound headings for details).",
