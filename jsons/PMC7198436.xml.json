            "text": "Landfills, the ultimate destination of most artificial wastes, contain huge amounts of pollutants derived from industrial and municipal solids. Due to naturally-occurring processes like weathering and runoff, high-concentration liquid leachates are released and performed direct and potential threats to surface and subsurface water as well as flora, fauna, and human health, especially for the unlined or old landfills localized near watercourses or in wetlands (Ford et al., 2011; Lorah et al., 2009). Therefore, Successful treatment of toxic substances in landfill leachate is a significant step towards the sustainable management of solid waste. Leachates must be carefully treated before being released into the surroundings or transferred to a secondary treatment plant. Unfortunately, in many countries and regions, leachates have been overlooked. Ford et al. conducted a field investigation to discover the source of arsenic at a Superfund site in Massachusetts (USA) and detected the presence of leachate-derived arsenic in groundwater and sediment (Ford et al., 2011). In addition, the presence of commonly used pesticide residues in concentrated leachate poses a high acute and chronic risk to the environment (Wang et al., 2019).",

The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in leachate can be as high as 1341\u22123100 mg L\u22121 and 3385\u22125000 mg O2\nL\n\u22121, respectively. The common characteristics of landfill leachate are low biodegradability (five-day biochemical oxygen demand to chemical oxygen demand (BOD5/COD) ratios of 0.07\u22120.27).

AOPs are classified into different types, including photocatalytic oxidation, Fenton or Fenton-like processes (Gode et al., 2019), electrochemical oxidation (Nie et al., 2016), and persulfate-based AOPs (Roy and Moholkar, 2019; Zhou et al., 2019). However, technical challenges limit their widespread applications. For example, although AOPs based on ozone activation have a high oxidizing capacity, the low mass transfer efficiency of ozone from the gas phase to the liquid phase and the release of excess ozone have negative impacts on the surrounding environment. In the Fenton oxidation process, the consumption of ferrous species increases the high cost of the subsequent sludge treatment, while the Fenton photo-assisted process is only effective in a narrow pH range. Electrochemical advanced oxidation requires large amounts of energy and expensive metal electrodes. Among these techniques, semiconductor-induced photocatalysis has attracted significant attention because it produces large number of active radicals for eliminating recalcitrant organic pollutants and uses economical and renewable solar energy. Thus, selection of a suitable semiconductor material is essential for photocatalysis-assisted AOPs.",

Coupling g-C3N4 and AOPs enhances the effectiveness of both materials and shows excellent results in degrading high concentration refractory contaminants in leachate. Herein, we present a brief review focusing on the development of graphitic carbon nitride as a promising catalyst for landfill leachate treatment. Although only a limited number of systematic and comprehensive studies using actual waste leachate have been performed, the potentials of AOPs combined with g-C3N4 for degrading the possible pollutants in leachate is also examined. In addition, the possible practical applications to leachate treatment are explained and concretely analyzed via a comparative discussion.

            "text": "The high performance and application of g-C3N4 is highly structure-dependent. There are two main allotropes of g-C3N4 (Fig. 1\n(a) and Fig. 1(b) ), periodic arrangements containing subunits of triazine (C3N3 ring) and tri-s-triazine (C6N7 tri-ring), respectively (Zambon et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2015). Theoretical calculations have shown that the g-C3N4 allotrope with C6N7 segments is more thermodynamically stable than the allotrope based on C3N3 (Kroke et al., 2002). Thus, tri-s-triazine is widely regarded as a promising candidate for g-C3N4-based applications (Kong et al., 2019). Unlike conventional semiconductors (e.g. SiC, GaN, ZnO, etc.), g-C3N4 has unique stability with respect to heat treatment and chemical resistance. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of g-C3N4 suggested that g-C3N4 is not volatile at 600 \u00b0C, while it can be completely decomposed at temperatures greater than 700 \u00b0C (Gillan, 2000). g-C3N4 also has high stability in extremely acidic and basic media and is insoluble in conventional solvents, including ethanol, water, tetrahydrofuran, toluene and diethyl ether. The structural stability of g-C3N4 may be due to the Van der Waals forces between the stacked graphitic layers. In addition, polymeric g-C3N4 has also attracted growing interests as semiconducting photocatalyst and has been named as the \u2018\u2018holy grail\u2019\u2019 for highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to its facile synthesis, fascinating electronic band structure, reliable functionalization and unique visible-light responsiveness (Liu et al., 2017). The g-C3N4 prepared by the microwave-assisted molten-salt strategy presents remarkable photocatalytic activity with considerable quantum yield (up to 10.7 % at 420 nm), suitable alignment of energy bandgap structures, convenient carrier transfer path, and more efficient separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs. Furthermore, the low cost, low toxicity, facile and large-scale fabrication of g-C3N4 improve the possibility of its application in various types of AOPs.",

            "text": "g-C3N4 can be prepared via several different approaches and the resulting products exhibit different physiochemical properties. Common methods of synthesizing g-C3N4 include thermal polymerization, solvothermal and sol\u2013gel methods, template-assisted methods, and chemical functionalization. Among these, thermal polymerization is the most popular and commonly used method for g-C3N4 preparation, due to its outstanding technical simplicity and low costs. Therefore, the thermal polymerization method is highlighted and emphasized in this review. The thermal polymerization process is mainly achieved by thermally polymerizing nitrogen- and carbon-rich precursors. The most frequently used organic precursors include urea, melamine, trithiocyanuric acid, dicyandiamide, cyanamide, triazoles, thiourea, guanidine thiocyanate, and guanidine hydrochloride. Formation of melamine by polyaddition and the removal of amino groups by polycondensation are the necessary processes during the formation of the g-C3N4 polymer network (Sudhaik et al., 2018). The thermal conditions play a crucial role in preparing the target g-C3N4, and different precursors require different thermal conditions for polymerization. As has been effectively summarized by Sudhaik et al. (Fig. 1), the fabrication of g-C3N4 using diverse precursors requires different thermal decomposition temperatures (Sudhaik et al., 2018). In addition, the thermal polymerization of cyanamide (CA) to synthesize g-C3N4 was discussed as an example. Different poly-condensates can coexist over a wide temperature range. When the temperature is higher than 600 \u00b0C, g-C3N4 becomes unstable and partially or fully decomposes, generating NH3 and CxNyHz. Thus, thermal polymerization temperature between 550 and 600 \u00b0C is generally chosen as the optimal temperature for g-C3N4 synthesis. Also, the properties of the target g-C3N4, including the surface area, porosity, absorption, photoluminescence, C/N ratio and nanostructure, can be strongly affected by the technical parameters of the thermal polymerization.",

Combining g-C3N4 with carbonaceous nanoparticles, nanosheets, and nanoribbons has attracted considerable interests due to the excellent properties of the composites, such as high specific surface area, remarkable adsorption properties, and high plasticity. Coupling g-C3N4 with nanocarbon materials is a good strategy to exploit the synergistic effect of both materials and broaden the applications of g-C3N4. Benchmark carbon materials, such as graphene oxide (RGO), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and carbon nanospheres (CNS), have been extensively studied. Graphene is a potential candidate for constructing g-C3N4-based nanocomposites. For example, coupling graphene with g-C3N4 produces nanocomposites with new features (Bai and Shen, 2011; Chen et al., 2013). Graphene@g-C3N4 hybrids have been shown to be good catalysts under visible light (Ai et al., 2015; Liao et al., 2012; Ong et al., 2015a, b; Tong et al., 2015), with synergistically improved photo-response of both materials in the visible region, prolonged life of the photogenerated charge carriers, enhanced adsorption properties and increased specific surface area. The coupling of g-C3N4 with CNTs also improved the efficiency of the photocatalytic degradation of aqueous pollutants (Ma et al., 2014; Pei et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2015). Other g-C3N4-based nanocomposites have also been fabricated with properties enhancement, such as C60/g-C3N4 (fullerene/g-C3N4)(Bai et al., 2014; Chai et al., 2014), carbon quantum dots (CQDs)/g-C3N4 hybrid nanocomposite(Li et al., 2016b; Liu et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020) and biochar/ g-C3N4 (BC-g-C3N4)(Li et al., 2019a, b). Hard and soft-templating procedures based on carbonaceous nanomaterials have both been used to remarkably improve the surface area of g-C3N4 by introducing pores into its structure (Chen et al., 2015b; Mo et al., 2014). Despite the successful optimization of its specific surface area, the low conductivity, high recombination rate, and low photocatalytic efficiency of g-C3N4 limit its applications.",

Metal-doping has been proved as a typical strategy to design the advanced g-C3N4 with boosting activity. Metal deposition, introducing heteroatoms, and coupling g-C3N4 with other semiconductors can further enhance the catalytic performance and extend the scope of the potential applications of g-C3N4. As reported, with metals addition, the active species in localized space could be enriched by deposition of metal nanoparticles into pores and channels, while the electronic structure of g-C3N4 could be changed for enhancing H2O adsorption and oxidation (Huang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). The above modulation of metals could regulate the tunes band edges and thus motivate the generation of hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH). Moreover, the formed metal nanostructures could also attribute a portion of catalytic activity of g-C3N4. Metals that are commonly used for decoration or doping include alkali metals, transition metals, rare earth metals and noble metals (Mamba and Mishra, 2016). For example, sodium-doped g-C3N4 showed a higher photocatalytic activity for decomposing organic chemicals under visible light illumination compared to pure g-C3N4, due to the effects of sodium on the band structure, narrowing the band gap and efficiently separating the charge carriers (Zhou et al., 2011). Similarly, doping potassium into g-C3N4 tuned the band structure and led a higher photocatalytic activity (Zhang et al., 2015a). 0.5 % Fe(III) loading also improved the catalytic degradation activity by improving the visible light absorption and inhibiting charge carrier recombination. Zirconium, molybdenum, cerium and europium have also been doped into g-C3N4 (Jin et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015b, 2016; Xu et al., 2013).",

The popular ROS employed by different types of AOPs included hydroxyl radicals (\u00b7OH), superoxide anions (O\u2022\u2013), sulfate radicals (SO4\n\u2022\u2013), and singlet oxygen (1O2).

However, ozone-based AOPs have limitations due to the low mass transfer efficiency of ozone from the gas phase to the liquid phase (El-Din and Smith, 2001; Gautam et al., 2019). Moreover, partial leaching of the ozone may negatively impact the surrounding environment. Because leachate has a complex matrix with a high content of organic compounds, a high dose of ozone is required to achieve the desired treatment efficiency. To a large extent, their high energy consumption and massive emission of ozone limit the application of ozone-based AOPs to the pre-treatment or post-treatment of leachate. Critical issues for application of the Fenton oxidation process include the narrow operating pH range (< 4), the rapid consumption of Fe2+, and the high cost of follow-up sludge treatment. Moreover, a high concentration of iron contaminants is produced and the suspended solids in leachate could block or absorb the UV energy during the photo-assisted Fenton process. Although electrochemical AOPs are easy to operate, needing for large amounts of energy and the expensive metal electrodes dominated the main drawback. In addition to these issues with application of the AOPs discussed above, the characteristics of leachate (e.g. the high concentration of contaminants and presence of various interfering substances) undoubtedly increase the difficulty of efficient treatment.",

Pre-adsorption on activated carbon (AC) in photocatalysis increased the degradation of 1,4-dioxane and decreased the production of toxic intermediates (Nomura et al., 2020). Poblete et al. further suggested that the use of adsorption as a pretreatment method result in a high removal rate for organic compounds and heavy metals during photocatalysis (Poblete et al., 2019). Ultrasound is an efficient assistance method, because it produces tiny bubbles that expand and implode in the liquid, coupled with the effects of turbulence and liquid circulation, and helped cleave H2O molecules to generate more hydroxyl radicals. Joshi and Saurabh found that combining ultrasonication with the Fenton reaction resulted in the efficient treatment of leachate (Joshi and Gogate, 2019). Anfruns et al. proposed a useful approach for efficient leachate treatment that combines AOPs with bio-anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), although it had a high nitrogen content and low BOD/N ratio. This anammox-assisted AOPs achieved a high nitrogen removal efficiency of up to 90 % (Anfruns et al., 2013). Furthermore, combining the Fenton reaction with membrane separation was very useful for decreasing membrane fouling and provided complementary treatment for leachate and produced effluent with contaminant contents that met the required regulatory levels for environmental release (Moravia et al., 2013).",

Among the available semiconductors, including TiO2, ZnO, CdS, SiC, WO3, and WS2, TiO2 is the most widely applied and studied semiconductor material. For landfill leachate treatment, the first study using photocatalysis involved in application of TiO2 as a photocatalyst on a pilot-plant scale. In this study, humic acid (HA), a model refractory organic compound for leachate pollutants, was rapidly decolorized and degraded under sunlight (Wiszniowski et al., 2004). These results showed that the photo-induced AOPs approach significantly shortens the subsequent biodegradation process (10 min per sample) and decreases the BOD5 (5 days). Even though TiO2 has the advantages of long-term stability and excellent results in combination with AOPs, its wide band gap, low utilization of solar energy, and fast electron-hole recombination limit its practical application. Many subsequent studies have been conducted to improve these properties, including by photocatalyst modification (decoration with metals, metal doping or heterojunction construction), technical improvements, and combination with other processes (Rocha et al., 2011; Vilar et al., 2011a, a; Vilar et al., 2011b, b). Moreover, exploring alternative semiconductor photocatalysts is another important way to improve photocatalytic leachate treatment.",

The known photodegradation processes performed by g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. 3\n, and provide theoretical evidences that g-C3N4 can generate free radicals and potentially efficiently treat leachate. As shown, during photocatalysis g-C3N4 is excited by absorbing photons, generating photo-induced electron-hole pairs due to the transfer of an electron from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) (Ge et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2019b). The absorbed energy (h\u03bd) must be larger than the band gap (Eg) of g-C3N4 (\u223c2.7 eV) (Wen et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2010b). In general, during the electron transfer process, the surface electrons (e\u2212) and holes (h+) serve as electron donors and acceptors for producing strongly oxidizing or reducing radical species which can directly degrade the various organic contaminants in leachate into CO2, H2O and other small molecule products. Take phenol removal by the Fe-g-C3N4 graphene hydrogel (rGH/Fe-g-C3N4) 3D structure as an example, in the presence of visible light, electrons and holes could be generated by rGH/Fe-g-C3N4. Partial electrons would quickly transfer to Fe3+ for Fe2+ formation, while other electrons could transfer to graphene via \u03c0-\u03c0 conjugation, and thus directly decompose H2O2 to form \u00b7OH. Generated Fe2+ can further react with H2O2 to produce \u00b7OH, which can firstly attack the ortho and para-carbons within benzene ring to form catechol and hydroquinone, subsequently open the ring to form the chain compounds and are finally mineralized into CO2 and H2O (Hu et al., 2020).",

Although there have been no specific studies of the practical application of g-C3N4 in leachate treatment, there are sufficient available mechanisms to eliminate the contaminants that are present in leachate. Employing g-C3N4 as a photocatalyst results in high degradation performance for the recalcitrant organic pollutants in leachate under visible light (Wang et al., 2009). Further combining fungal degradation (using white rot fungi) with photocatalytic g-C3N4 produced superior performance for the degradation of organic compounds in leachate under visible light (Hu et al., 2017). The white rot fungi that were used efficiently on pre-biodegradation of natural lignocellulosic substrates and various organic pollutants by secreting extracellular enzymes, and their spatial structure provided a large number of tiny interspaces and active reaction sites for degradation reactions. Ultimately, this combination not only achieved 74.99 % organic carbon (TOC) removal (the initial TOC concentration was 100 mg L\u22121), but also showed excellent degradation potential for almost all the organic compounds present in leachate (Hu et al., 2017). Other studies have also shown that the microbial degradation of dye-containing wastewater by photosynthetic bacteria was improved significantly due to a synergistic effect between the C16 alkane degradation performed by JLS1 bacteria and simultaneous photocatalysis by g-C3N4, (Xu et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017).",

Previous studies showed that g-C3N4 possessed both excellent antibacterial and antiviral activities (Zhang et al., 2019a), which may provide a low-cost and environmental-friendly alternative for the sustainable leachate treatment (Ong et al., 2016). Yu et al. displayed that the high inactivation efficiency of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (tetracycline-resistant Escherichia coli, TC-E. coli) in secondary effluents could be achieved by using Ag/AgBr/g-C3N4 as the photocatalyst (Yu et al., 2020). In addition, Zhang et al. also found a water-surface-floating photocatalytic g-C3N4 composites (g-C3N4/EP-520) can exhibit an excellent antibacterial/ antiviral activity under visible-light irradiation, extending the application of g-C3N4-based material for water disinfection (Zhang et al., 2018). To better meet the real demand, further studies toward an in-depth understanding of the microbial inactivation process are encouraged, while the researches about lethal action of photocatalysts and the vulnerable components of microbes for maximizing the inactivation efficiency are also required. Several studies have demonstrated the theoretical and technical feasibility of the application of g-C3N4 in combination with AOPS in leachate treatment.

Photocatalytic denitrification of leachate by g-C3N4 has become an available option. The photocatalytically generated electrons and holes can be used for reduction and oxidation, respectively. Photocatalytic denitrification using g-C3N4 also can avoid the limitations of applying biological denitrification, due to insufficient electron donors. TiO2/g-C3N4 photocatalysts coupled with in-situ cultivated biofilms have been shown to enhance nitrate reduction in water, with 40.3 % removal of the nitrate after 16 h. This approach provides a new strategy for enhancing nitrate reduction in leachate and insights into the reduction mechanism (Zhang et al., 2020). Moreover, the hazards of releasing large molecular weight organic compounds into the environment are also an important issue in leachate treatment. A magnetic fluorinated mesoporous g-C3N4 has been employed for the photocatalytic degradation of the antibiotic amoxicillin (AMX) in leachate, and achieved a higher degree of mineralization with a lower accumulation of toxic by-products (Mirzaei et al., 2019). Moreover, AOPs based on sulfate radicals (SO4\n\u2022\u2013), which have a high oxidation potential, can be combined with g-C3N4. Sulfate radicals are usually generated by the activation of persulfate (PS) through heating, UV irradiation, bases, or transition metals. g-C3N4 displayed high catalytic activity for the activation of persulfate in persulfate-based AOPs. The results reported by Wang et al. indicated that Pd nanoparticles anchored on g-C3N4 were very active for the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) by efficiently activating PMS (Wang et al., 2017). The composite photocatalyst Cr2O3/C3N4 achieved the rapid photodegradation of 2-chlorophenol under visible light with a removal rate of 94 % at the optimal pH (Anjum et al., 2018).",

Most studies have dealt with the degradation of single components in leachate. The development of a high-performance g-C3N4 catalyst would be key for the remediation of complex wastewater using AOPs. Based on laboratory tests and theoretical studies, and considering the characteristics of waste leachate like its complex, high concentration components, high ammonia nitrogen content, and the presence of unknown interfering substances, it is necessary to expand this application to resolve the practical issues of leachate pollution. Coupling AOPs with other methods and technologies should be actively explored and applied in practical problem solving. Furthermore, leachate treatment using g-C3N4 should also be extended to the remediation of secondary sites, such as leachate sediment and the surrounding soil. Hopefully, this review will encourage more research into applying the robust and inexpensive g-C3N4 in photocatalytic AOPs for leachate treatment.",
