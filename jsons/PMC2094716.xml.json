In the PBMC from one recovered SARS patient (SARS patient #1 \u2013 HLA-DR03+08+), there were 17 peptide pools that produced \u2265 25 IFN-\u03b3 spot-forming cells (SFC)/106 PBMC (range 25\u201370 IFN-\u03b3 SFC /106 PBMC). In PBMC from the other recovered SARS patient (SARS patient #2 \u2013 HLA-DR15+), there were no peptide pools that produced \u2265 25 IFN-\u03b3 SFC/106 PBMC even though the response to phytohemagglutinin was robust.

Four CD4+ T-cell lines recognized peptide S729\u2013745 (TECANLLLQYGSFCTQL). 3 of these 4 lines were clearly HLA-DR-restricted, and CTL activity against allogeneic target cells suggested HLA-DR08 restriction. The optimal epitope for HLA-DR08 restricted CD4+ T-cell activation was essentially the entire 17mer peptide. By IFN-\u03b3 ICS (10 \u03bcg/ml peptide \u00d7 6 h), only peptide S729\u2013745, and not the flanking overlapping peptides S723\u2013738 or S736\u2013753, stimulated IFN-\u03b3 production from the four CD4+ T-cell lines noted above (Fig. 1\n). The highest HLA-DR08 gene frequencies have been reported in Latino American and Asian American racial groups, and HLA-DR08 alleles have been reported at moderate frequencies in Filipino populations (Mack et al., 2000). Peptide S358\u2013374 (STFFSTFKCYGVSATKL) also appeared to be HLA-DR08 restricted. The HLA restriction of peptide S427\u2013444 (NIDATSTGNYNYKYRYLR) was unable to be determined (Table 1). Neutralizing antibodies to the SARS CoV recognize epitopes in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein \u2013 between amino acids 318 and 510 (He et al., 2005, Hwang et al., 2006, Li et al., 2005). Two of the three S protein CD4+ T-cell epitopes we identified are in the RBD (S358\u2013374 and S427\u2013444). However, the predominant CD4+ T-cell response in recovered SARS patient #1 was directed against an epitope outside the RBD (S729\u2013745).",

Individual CD4+ T-cell epitopes were identified within the N protein (Peng et al., 2006b). We believe our study is the first to identify individual human CD4+ T-cell epitopes within the SARS CoV S protein and characterize their HLA restriction (HLA-DR08). We have also identified potential HLA-DR15-restricted peptides from the SARS CoV S, M, and E proteins. Some have suggested that the SARS CoV S protein RBD by itself could be an effective subunit vaccine (He et al., 2005). Our findings suggest that dominant SARS CoV anti-S CD4+ T-helper responses could be directed to epitopes outside the RBD. Our data also illustrate that in some individuals humoral and CD4+ T-cell immunity to SARS CoV may wane rapidly. What levels of humoral or CD4+ T-cell immunity are associated with clinical protection remain unknown. An improved understanding of SARS CoV-specific memory immune responses will help guide future vaccination strategies in the event of SARS or SARS-like coronavirus re-emergence in humans.",

T-cell lines were established by bulk culture peptide stimulation, limiting dilution, and standard 51Cr release CTL assays (Jameson et al., 1998). IFN-\u03b3 ICS assays were performed after 6-h stimulation with peptide in the presence of a Golgi inhibitor (brefeldin A), as previously described (Mangada et al., 2004). Anti-SARS CoV IgG titers were measured by ELISA to inactivated virus-infected cell lysates in serial plasma samples, as previously described (Ksiazek et al., 2003). Fourfold serial dilutions of each plasma sample were assayed in duplicate. A reciprocal titer < 100 was undetectable (coded as reciprocal titer = 50). All 16 healthy contacts had undetectable anti-SARS CoV IgG levels (reciprocal titer < 100).",
