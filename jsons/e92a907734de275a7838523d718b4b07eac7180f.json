These guidelines contain recommendations regarding triaging in order to define what procedures, device checks and clinic visits can be postponed during the pandemic.

According to published statistics, a significant percentage of COVID-19 infections are acquired in hospitals [2] , with the potential risk of crosscontamination among health care workers, which limits even further the capacity to respond to the pandemic. For these reasons, it is imperative to reorganize outpatient and inhospital services in order to optimize the use of technical and human resources, but most importantly to protect patients, health care workers, and their families from the risk of transmission.",

The recommendations outlined in this document are in accordance with guidelines issued by international organizations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection [3] [4] [5] [6] and have been adapted to the activities specific to our field. They will be in place while community-based measures are maintained by regulatory bodies at the international and local levels and could be modified in the short term depending on the behavior of the pandemic and the issuance of new global public health guidelines. In addition, we have proposed general recommendations for the antiarrhythmic management of patients with COVID-19 infection. In the absence of specific clinical studies guiding antiarrhythmic management in these patients, our recommendations are based on international consensus guidelines and are aimed to minimize unnecessary exposure risk while at the same time maintaining essential care for urgent arrhythmic conditions that, if untreated, could result in patient harm or clinical decompensation requiring hospital admission. The recommendations relative to remote consults and monitoring must conform to local regulations, which may vary between countries and institutions.",

We recommend a case-by-case triage of patients previously scheduled for in-clinic consult in order to determine if the visit can be postponed while social distancing measures are in place (Table 1 ). This decision should be based on analysis of the clinical history, data from last device interrogation, and information regarding clinical stability assessed by telephone contact. Telephone contact should include questions to identify suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases (e.g., travel history, sick contacts, and respiratory symptoms). 2. We recommend postponing in-clinic follow-ups of patients with CIEDs that have been evaluated within the previous year if their clinical condition is stable and there are no device alerts. 3. In patients nearing battery depletion that cannot be followed remotely, the need for in-clinic assessment should be decided based on the battery estimated longevity measured at the last follow-up and pacing-dependence. 4. In patients with recently implanted devices, we recommend postponing in-clinic evaluation if their condition is stable and there were no findings during the implant warranting early follow-up. 5. Patients on remote monitoring should continue to be followed remotely. Patients with devices amenable to remote monitoring in which this function has not been activated, should be encouraged to switch to remote monitoring. 6. In patients with an implantable loop recorder (ILR) that cannot be followed remotely, we recommend postponing in-clinic evaluation if their condition is stable. 7. We recommend proper documentation of remote device follow-ups according to local regulations. ",

In patients with abnormal QT prolongation, we recommend correction of electrolytes abnormalities (K + > 4 mEq/l, Mg 2+ > 2 mEq/l), discontinuation of unnecessary QT-prolonging drugs and continuous telemetry for monitoring of ventricular arrhythmias. If torsades de pointes is noted on telemetry, all QTc prolonging drugs should be discontinued. 4. The US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) has approved the use of KardiaMobile 6 L (AliveCore) to monitor the QTc duration in COVID-19 patients receiving QTprolonging drugs [16] .
