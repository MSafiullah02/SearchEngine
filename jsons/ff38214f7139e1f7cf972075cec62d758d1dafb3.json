Thus, MBL plays a major role in the first-line innate defense against pathogens. We investigated the MBL concentrations in serum during experimental infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infections in chickens. The results showed that the acute phase MBL response to infection with IBV was, to a degree (P < 0.0068), dependent on whether the chickens were inoculated after 12 h of rest (dark) or after 12 h of activity (light).

The specific antibody titer against IBV was also tested, and a difference (P < 0.0091) between the two experimental groups was found with peak titer values of 6,816 and 4,349. However, the highest value was found in chickens inoculated after 12 h of activity. Thus, an inverse relation exists between the MBL response and the IBV specific antibody response. The ability of MBL to activate the complement cascade was tested in a heterologous system by deposition of human C4 on the chicken MBL/MASP complex. The complement activation was directly associated with the concentration of MBL in serum, indicating neutralization of the virus before the humoral antibody response took over.",

Chicken MBL (cMBL) has been isolated from liver and serum by means of cMBL-specific monoclonal antibodies (Oka et al., 1985; Sugii and Hirota, 1994; Laursen et al., 1995) . Furthermore, assays with cMBL Abbreviation Key: cMBL = chicken MBL; IBV = infectious bronchitis virus; IBDV = infectious bursal disease virus; ILTV = infectious laryngotracheitis virus; MASP = MBL-associated serine protease; MBL = mannan-binding lectin; OD = optical density; PI = postinfection. bound to solid-phase mannan showed that the chicken lectin could mediate an antibody-independent activation of the complement as judged by the activation and deposition of human complement component C4 on the MBL/ MASP complex. Deposition of human C4 was dependent on the amount of cMBL added to the assay and the presence of calcium. Nielsen et al. (1998 Nielsen et al. ( , 1999 investigated the function of cMBL in connection with avian viral infections. They studied the level and distribution of chicken MBL in different tissues during experimental infection with infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The serum concentration of chicken MBL increased two-to threefold in virus-infected chickens compared with noninfected controls, indicating that chicken MBL is a minor acute phase reactant. In noninfected controls, cMBL was found in the cytoplasm of a few liver cells, whereas more cells were found in the liver from IBDV-or ILTV-infected chickens, indicating an upregulation of the MBL synthesis during acute infection. They also observed cMBL in germinal centers of cecal tonsils of noninfected cells. Furthermore, they found that cMBL had the ability to bind to ILTV-infected tracheal cells and the ability to bind to macrophage-like cells in the spleen from IBDV-infected cells . These results strongly indicate that cMBL plays an active role in the innate immune system. In IBV studies (Nielsen et al., 1999) , the MBL concentration peaked 3 to 7 d after infection and returned to normal levels 6 to 10 d after the infection. However, only four of the eight chickens (7 wk old) analyzed had increased serum concentrations of MBL (1.5 to 3-fold) within the first 8 d postinfection (PI). The remaining chickens did not respond at all. Nielsen et al. (1999) proposed that the inconsistent MBL response was possibly a parallel manifestation of the mild distress (no clinical signs observed) caused by the IBV infection.",

However, we were not able to demonstrate reduced cMBL in sera from chickens 4 to 5 wk old (Figure 1 ). In fact, in our experiments, we analyzed serum samples weekly taken from a total of 60 birds at 14 to 38 d of age prior to inoculation with virus, and none of these birds had a dramatic decrease in serum concentration of cMBL. Laursen and Nielsen (2000) reported the decrease in serum level of cMBL at 4 to 5 wk of age on the basis of samples taken from five chickens only.

This finding could not be due to volume differences in the blood during the day because all blood samples were taken at the same time of the day (0900 h), nor do we think it could be due to feed intake, as water and food were supplied ad libitum. Apparently, the MBL response was correlated with light and darkness or the diurnal rhythm in general. Many neuroendocrine hormones exhibit rhythmicity. Given the close relationship between the neuroendocrine pathways and the immune system, it is expected that some immune parameters exhibit diurnal rhythmicity. As an example, the neural hormone melatonin participates in many important physiological functions, including the control of seasonal reproduction, as well as influencing the immune system (Guerrero and Reiter, 1992) . In chickens, the serum concentration of melatonin reaches its maximum level at the midpoint of the dark phase and its minimum level at the midpoint of the light phase (Lynch, 1971; Petrovsky and Harrison, 1997) . However, other explanations may be just as possible. In the future, it would be interesting to further investigate the mechanism(s) behind the observed difference in serum cMBL levels.",

One possible explanation for the difference in specific antibody titer could be that the specific antibody response was subjected to similar light and darkness mechanisms or to diurnal rhythm mechanisms as cMBL. However, another possibility could be an antiviral neutralizing effect of MBL through complement activation and opsonization by MBL receptors on phagocytic cells as the first line of defense removing IBV before the adaptive immune response takes over. The latter possibility was tested in a heterologous complement activation system. As shown in Figure 4 , the ability of serum to deposit C4 on the MBL/MASP complex is totally parallel with the level of serum concentrations of MBL. This result suggests that quick removal of IBV by opsonization is a probable explanation of the lower specific antibody titer in serum samples from chickens inoculated at 0900 h than in those inoculated at 2100 h.",

Moreover, it also seems important to investigate the involvement of intermittent lighting to chickens in relation to immunological factors.",
