For each patient, in addition to recording demographic and clinical data, healthcare personnel collected a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. As part of routine surveillance, specimens were initially tested for respiratory viruses including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenoviruses, metapneumovirus, coronaviruses, parainfluenza, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and bocaviruses (8). Later, samples collected during September\u2013December 2014 were screened for EV-D68, as described elsewhere (9). For the molecular studies, the viral capsid protein 1 (VP1) gene region of EV-D68 was amplified and sequenced as described elsewhere (10). ",

The single patient with ARI who tested positive for EV-D68 was a 7-month-old child, with no underlying disease, who had clinical signs of acute bronchitis, including dry cough, pulmonary condensation, rhinorrhea, progressive breathing difficulty, and an unusually long duration of illness of >1 month; his condition deteriorated and he was hospitalized.

Results identified EV-D68 activity from October through December 2014 in Senegal, with peak EV-D68 detection occurring in October. This aligns with findings reported in countries in Europe (11); in North America, peaks were mapped in August in the United States (13) and in September in Canada (14).These results suggest circulation of the virus in Senegal 2 months after the beginning of the outbreak in the United States (1). This 2-month delay was also noted by Nathaniel et al. (15) before the introduction of EV-D68 strains in the Caribbean region. However, earlier EV-D68 circulation was reported in Latin America (3,4) and Europe (5\u20137). ",

Phylogenetically, the US outbreak was characterized by a novel subclade, B1, which emerged rapidly and was the dominant strain. Available data indicate that the exclusive circulation of clade A in Senegal during the 2014 outbreak was reported elsewhere only in Spain. In contrast, Slovenia, Norway (11), the Caribbean region (15), Mexico (4), and Chile (3) reported only clade B over the same period. ",

First, the inclusion of fever as a clinical sign for the case definition may have contributed to underestimating the number of EV-D68 infections during the North America outbreak; several studies have reported cases of afebrile EV-D68 infections (13). A second limitation was the small number of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases in this study, because a higher proportion of detected EV-D68 in SARI patients or those with other concurrent conditions has been previously reported (5). At the time of data collection, the SARI sentinel surveillance system we used was not as developed as it is now. Inclusion in the screening of a larger number of hospitalized patients would probably present a more accurate picture of EV-D68 circulation. Finally, we conducted a retrospective study. The database we used contained limited information on disease outcome, and atypical clinical symptoms were not reported. Thus, the association between EV-D68 infections and severe clinical signs could not be established. ",

Our study also adds to the growing body of evidence that EV-D68 may cause severe respiratory disease, especially in children, even in those without underlying chronic respiratory diseases. The detection of EV-D68 in a child with a severe respiratory infection reinforces the need to include this virus in SARI sentinel surveillance, which is focused mainly on pediatric hospitalization. Through this system, data on disease outcome, underlying complications, atypical clinical signs, duration of symptoms or hospitalization, and treatment are routinely collected to better assess burden. Additional research will be necessary to investigate cases of acute flaccid paralysis to determine their relationship with EV-D68 infections.",

The phylogenetic tree based on nucleotide sequences of partial viral protein 1 genomic regions of EV-D68 strains was generated using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA6 (http://www.megasoftware.net). Sequences are identified by GenBank accession number, country, and period of detection. The phylogenetic tree is rooted by the oldest EV-D68 sequence in GenBank, the Fermon strain (pink), collected in 1962 in California, USA. We performed 1,000 bootstrap replicates to determine the consensus tree; support for nodes present in >70% of the trees are annotated. Scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site. ",
