The mouse B2m gene is di-allelic, encoding two proteins that differ at a single amino acid residue [1]. B2M exists as a soluble product in serum, and, since its gene lacks a transmembrane coding exon, it is released into solution from a variety of cells. The B2M protein forms physical associations with a number of molecules; these include major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I and cluster of differentiation 1 (CD1) [2]. B2M also associates with the Fc receptor of the placenta, where it allows trans-placental transport of IgG from the mother to the foetus [3], and associates with the Fc receptor of neonatal gut epithelium for transport of IgG in the gut epithelium [4]. The major histocompatibility complex-related Fc receptor (FCGRT) is also implicated in IgG homeostasis in the adult [5]. In addition, it participates in the regulation of albumin [6] and in HFE (iron transport) [7].",

As a consequence, adult mice are susceptible to some parasitic diseases such as Trypanosoma cruzi infections [13], but not leishmaniasis [14] or blood-stage malarial infections [15]. These mice also have delayed viral clearance and increased mortality after Theiler virus infection [16]; and are susceptible to mouse hepatitis virus with the infected mice being more susceptible to acute hepatitis and encephalitis [17]. In rheovirus infection, B2m\u2212/\u2212 mice showed enhanced intestinal mucosal and systemic immune responses by elevated IgG and IgA [18]. However, quite remarkably, in the absence of infections, a B2m\u2212/\u2212 strain has a healthy phenotypic appearance, develops well into adulthood and has a normal life span, despite a deficiency in iron metabolism [19].",

Mice from this colony, the wild-type parental strain (B2m+/+ C57BL/6) and heterozygous offspring of crosses between these two strains were used. The frequency of mating was defined by the appearance of postcopulatory vaginal plugs after overnight pairing of single B2m\u2212/\u2212, B2m+/+, or B2m\u2212/+ males with groups of up to three females of B2m\u2212/\u2212, B2m\u2212/+, or wild-type B2m+/+ genotypes.

Once a mouse was seen to be pregnant, the male was removed from the breeding pair and the female was housed alone until her pups were weaned. Thus stress due to overcrowding or the presence of the male was avoided.

Previous studies have shown that soluble MHC Class I molecules can act as pheromones, influencing mating signals within rodent colonies [35\u201339]. Therefore, a possible mechanism operating in the B2m-deficient mice is the absence of secreted MHC class I products, and thus the absence of mating signals resulting in impaired breeding. This mechanism might also render the female unable to recognize the offspring as her own, leading to cannibalistic behavior. It has been postulated that MHC genes act as kin-recognition markers to increase relatedness among communal nesting partners [21, 24, 52]. Mice can recognize one another by individual characteristic body odors that reflect their genetic constitution at the MHC [22] and mothers are able to recognize syngeneic pups from other pups differing only in MHC [23]. Pup lethality, a form of cannibalism affecting female nurturing behavior, has also been reported as a result of fosB gene deficiency [53]; although in a different context, the phenotypic effect bears some similarity to the effect of the B2m deficiency. In humans, there is also data suggesting that MHC genes are linked to olfactory receptors and act as odor recognition cues in mating choices [44\u201349].",

In previous studies, we have shown that C57BL/6 (H2-Db) derived MHC Class I products are synthesized at the one-cell embryo stage, arguing for a requirement of MHC in development [55]. This finding was confirmed in another mouse strain; Arcellana-Panlilio and Schultsz showed that in the CD-1 Swiss albino mice, H-2 Kq products were also expressed at all stages of preimplantation development [56]. The exact mechanism for a role of MHC in early development is still unclear. It may involve stage-specific antigen synthesis to allow differentiation and cell division, similar to the role of differentiation molecules involved in the ontogeny of lymphocytes [57]. MHC-mediated transmembrane signaling pathways, particularly in the case of H2-Q products, which have glycosidylinositolphosphate, anchored transmembrane domains [58] might also be a signal mechanism operating in mammalian embryogenesis. We have postulated that a background level of MHC Class I is required for successful mouse development and for protection against maternal large granular cells and natural killer cells (NK) [59], as it has become established that in the adult, NK effector cell recognition involves targeting cells with diminished MHC expression [60].",

The above observations suggest that a homeostatic level of MHC might be protective and influence normal development and viability early in life. It is possible that in the B2m\u2212/\u2212 mouse strain the lack of B2M impairs the synthesis and cell-surface expression of MHC Class I, thus altering the normal balance of MHC expression during early stages of development. B2M normally associates with the Fc receptor of the placenta [3], therefore, in the pregnant female B2m\u2212/\u2212 mice, the Fc receptor may have a reduced capacity to transport IgG molecules across the placenta to the developing embryo, affecting development and reducing litter size.",
