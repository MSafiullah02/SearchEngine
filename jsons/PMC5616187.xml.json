            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus with a single-stranded RNA genome that causes an estimated 390 million infections and up to 96 million dengue cases worldwide every year (Bhatt et al., 2013). There are four closely related serotypes of DENV (DENV-1 to DENV-4), each of which encodes three structural proteins (Capsid [C], pre-Membrane/Membrane [prM/M], and Envelope [E]) and seven non-structural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5). Infections with DENV can result in a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to the debilitating acute febrile illness, dengue fever (DF), to the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) (WHO, 1997). Major determinants of dengue pathogenesis include virulence of the infecting DENV strain, host genetic factors, and pre-existing host immune responses from prior infection(s) with a different DENV serotype (Halstead and Yamarat, 1965, Messer et al., 2003, Nguyen et al., 2008, OhAinle et al., 2011, Rico-Hesse et al., 1997). In sequential infections, disease severity appears to be determined by a complex interplay of protective and enhancing components from pre-existing immunity to viral antigens (Halstead, 2009, Peiris and Porterfield, 1979, Rothman and Ennis, 1999). Such intricacies of the human immune response to DENV infection have made it difficult not only to identify the precise mechanisms that trigger progression to severe disease but also to engineer vaccines and therapeutics for combating the disease.",

            "text": "Replication of DENV within each host produces a population of genetically related but distinct genomes (referred to as intrahost diversity) due to the error-prone nature of the viral replicase, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) (Domingo and Holland, 1997). These intrahost variants are thought to serve as templates on which evolutionary mechanisms act to shape variation at the consensus level between hosts (i.e., interhost diversity), leading to the emergence of genetically distinct strains and genotypes of DENV. Genetic variations in intrahost populations have been proposed to influence disease outcome and pathogenesis in chronic human infections with RNA viruses such as HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Farci et al., 2002, Joos et al., 2005, Lee et al., 2008, Moreau et al., 2008, Sullivan et al., 2007), which provide considerable time frames (months to years) for discernible virus evolution in response to intrahost selection pressures. Similar observations have also been reported in chronic infections with influenza virus and norovirus, viruses that are usually associated with acute infections (Bull et al., 2012, Debbink et al., 2014, Rogers et al., 2015, Valkenburg et al., 2013). These studies have characterized the emergence of individual variants associated with immune evasion or drug resistance. Unlike chronic infections, only a handful of studies have reported on the evolutionary mechanisms and viral genetics driving virus evolution in acute human infections such as Ebola (Gire et al., 2014, Ni et al., 2016), chikungunya (Stapleford et al., 2016), influenza A (Sobel Leonard et al., 2016), Middle East respiratory syndrome (Park et al., 2016), and dengue (Parameswaran et al., 2012, Rodriguez-Roche et al., 2016, Sessions et al., 2015, Sim et al., 2015, Thai et al., 2012), where virus evolution is severely constrained by time (days to weeks). Consequently, limited information exists about the fitness and pathogenesis profiles of individual intrahost DENV variants that emerge in acute human infections. Information on intrahost viral diversity can provide new perspectives in assessing infection outcome, disease pathogenesis, and vaccine or therapeutic efficacy in individuals with dengue or other closely related viral infections such as Zika.",

Multiplexed libraries for high-throughput sequencing were constructed from pooled amplicon mixes and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform to yield 150-nucleotide (nt) paired-end reads in forward (read 1) and reverse (read 2) orientations. Reference genomes were reconstructed for each sample using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) and SAMtools (Li et al., 2009), and in-house python scripts were used to calculate variation at the nucleotide, codon, and amino acid levels for each locus in the DENV-3 coding region (see STAR Methods). After filtering for coverage (\u22651,000 reads) and Sanger quality scores (\u226530), median coverage per codon locus was 22,975 and 20,024 for read 1 and read 2 datasets, respectively. Only samples with \u226550% coverage of the DENV-3 genome were retained for downstream analyses; 68 PBMC and 31 plasma samples from 77 individuals, including paired PBMC-plasma datasets from 22 individuals, passed the threshold for genome coverage. Coding-region coverage in these samples varied between 50.7% and 99.9% (median of 98.9%) for both read 1 and read 2 datasets combined (Table S1).",

We compared the percent loci per protein that are variant in any sample between 1\u00b0 and 2\u00b0 dengue and found significantly fewer unique variant loci in 2\u00b0 dengue cases, both in PBMC (Figure 1\nA; left panel, p < 0.001) and plasma (Figure 1A; right panel, p < 0.01) samples. These observations were not due to systematic disparities in the yields of viral RNA, since measures of genome equivalents (GE) per milliliter of extracted viral RNA were not significantly different between 1\u00b0 and 2\u00b0 cases for both PBMC and plasma samples (Figure 1B; left and right panels). Thus, DENV-3 appears to be evolving at fewer distinct loci genome-wide in 2\u00b0 dengue compared with 1\u00b0 dengue, suggesting that virus evolution is constrained by pre-existing immune pressures in 2\u00b0 dengue. In addition, we examined the locations of unique variant loci on the exposed and membrane-associated surfaces of the E protein, which is a prominent target for antibody-mediated immunity in human dengue. We detected fewer unique variant loci across all samples in 2\u00b0 dengue cases compared with 1\u00b0 cases (Figure 1C; top and bottom panels) on both the exposed and the membrane-associated surfaces of E; much of this difference was contributed by PBMC-specific variant loci. Thus, consistent with genome-wide differences between 1\u00b0 and 2\u00b0 dengue, the breadth of the viral variant repertoire in E appears to be reduced in 2\u00b0 dengue compared with 1\u00b0 dengue. Such global differences in viral composition between naive individuals and individuals with pre-existing immunity to DENV indicate that the extent of diversity in the intrahost DENV-3 population is directed by the immune repertoire during acute dengue in humans. Further studies investigating particular epitopes will help resolve the specificities of pre-existing immune pressures contributing to differential rates of viral microevolution in 1\u00b0 and 2\u00b0 dengue.",

We also analyzed interhost diversity in 690 full-length DENV-3 consensus genomes (GenBank) and found that even though DENV-3 exhibited codon-level diversity at prM100 and E315 (Figure 2E, left panel, red bars), virus populations were invariant in the interhost amino acid sequence at all three hotspots (Figure 2E, right panel, red bars, and Table S2), suggestive of macro-evolutionary (i.e., consensus-level) constraints at these loci. In addition to major hotspots, we detected several minor hotspots, defined as loci with 1.0% or higher variant abundance in \u226510% of samples, in both PBMC and plasma samples (Figure S2D, all minor hotspots marked with \u02c6). Of these minor hotspots, only one (codon 1071 in polyprotein) appeared to be shared between PBMC and plasma samples at a diversity threshold of 1.0% (Figure S2D). All minor hotspots (loci marked with \u02c6) exhibited interhost diversity at the codon level (Figure S2E, left panel, red line, and Table S2), but interhost amino acid diversity was only observed at five out of nine minor hotspots (Figure S2E, right panel, red line, and Table S2). Overall, our findings demonstrate that hotspots for intrahost viral diversity can be detected in acute human dengue. Furthermore, the presence of hotspot variants at macroevolutionarily conserved loci highlight the importance of host-specific selection pressures in DENV-3 intrahost evolution.",

In samples with detectable levels of both prM variants at the population level, we observed that all haplotypes with the prM100 variant also included the prM101 variant (and vice versa), demonstrating that the prM variants were linked, i.e., present on the same variant viral genome (Figure 3\nA, red arrowheads). Moreover, we identified haplotypes with variants at only one prM hotspot (Figure S2F), which implied that DENV-3 was evolving independently at each of the prM100 and prM101 hotspots. The prM100,101 variant thus appears to be the result of sequential evolution at prM100 and prM101 on the same viral genome. Our haplotype analysis also revealed significant interhost diversity at three loci proximal to the prM100,101 and E315 hotspots (Figures 3A and 3B; black arrowheads). Four different haplotypes with a wide range of frequencies were detected among the consensus genomes in our samples, each with unique combinations of nucleotide diversity at these loci (Figures 3A and 3B, and Table S3). Nucleotides at all three polymorphic loci were 100% concordant between the dominant WT consensus genome and the prM/M or E variant genome for all samples (Figures 3A and 3B and Table S3; variant genomes marked with \u2217). This was true even for samples with low-frequency consensus haplotypes (C-A-T and A-G-G haplotypes for prM/M and E, respectively), and for samples in which mixed infections with multiple WT haplotypes were detected (Figures 3A and 3B; genomes marked with #). The genetic concordance between WT and variant haplotypes in our samples strongly support the independent emergence and/or expansion of these hotspot variants within each individual, although we cannot completely exclude contributions from co-circulating variants at the prM100,101 and E315 loci. Taken together, our observations indicate that variants at the prM100,101 and E315 hotspot loci arose by convergent evolution during acute dengue, in at least four independent events, corresponding to the presence of the variants in four distinct haplotypes.",

We evaluated the replication phenotypes of WT and mutant viruses in C6/36 mosquito cells by directly competing each mutant virus with WT virus in co-infection experiments (Quiner et al., 2014). Viral RNA mixtures from the input and from cellular supernatants collected 3, 4, and 5 days post infection (d.p.i.) were sequenced by the Sanger method to capture ratios of WT and mutant nucleotides at the prM100,101 and E315 hotspots using the polySNP program. The replicative index, calculated as the log2 value of relative levels of WT and mutant viruses in the supernatant compared with relative levels in the input, was negative for prM100,101 or E315 mutant viruses at 3\u20135 d.p.i., indicating that both mutants were replication defective in C6/36 cells compared with WT (Figure 4\nA). In addition, we assessed the replication phenotypes of WT and mutant viruses in a human monocytic U937 cell line that expresses DC-SIGN, a co-receptor for DENV entry (Tassaneetrithep et al., 2003) (U937-DC-SIGN). Single infections were performed in U937-DC-SIGN cells with 625 GE/cell each of WT, prM100,101, and E315 viruses. All three viruses were able to establish infection in U937-DC-SIGN cells; however, the percent of infected cells was considerably reduced in infections with prM100,101 and E315 variants compared with WT virus at 1, 2, and 3 d.p.i., as determined with both anti-E and anti-NS3 antibodies (Figure 4B, left and right panels, respectively). No revertants were detected at 3 d.p.i. with either variant (data not shown). The E315 variant also exhibited a temperature-sensitive (32\u00b0C versus 37\u00b0C) plaquing phenotype on baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells with better plaquing at 32\u00b0C, whereas the prM100,101 variant plaqued relatively well at 37\u00b0C (Figure S4). Our results thus demonstrate that the prM100,101 and E315 mutant viruses establish infections in C6/36 mosquito cells, U937-DC-SIGN human cells, and in BHK-21 mammalian cells with considerably reduced efficiencies due to the deleterious effects of these mutations on viral replicative ability.",

We do not anticipate that these mutations have a direct impact on viral RNA replication, as none of the DENV structural proteins, except RNA elements in the Capsid gene (Byk and Gamarnik, 2016, Clyde et al., 2008, de Borba et al., 2015, Friebe et al., 2011, Selisko et al., 2014), have been implicated in a direct role in RNA replication. In studies by Zheng et al. (2014), mutations at prM98 in DENV-1 were shown to result in impaired prM processing and decreased viral infectivity. prM100 and prM101 are situated only 2\u20133 amino acids away from prM98, and given the absence of entry and replication defects, we hypothesize that the prM100,101 hotspot mutations likely impair prM processing and DENV infectivity, by a mechanism similar to prM98 (Zheng et al., 2014). Even though prM antibodies have been identified by several groups (Beltramello et al., 2010, Dejnirattisai et al., 2010), the immune pressures driving evolution at the prM/M locus are poorly understood, and the origin of the prM100,101 variant viruses remains elusive. In contrast, significantly more is known about the functionalities and antigenicity of loci in the E protein, and specifically the E315 locus. Previous studies have shown that E315 plays a pH-sensing role in mediating viral fusion with the endosome at the post-entry stage (Nelson et al., 2009), suggesting that viruses with the E315 hotspot mutation are likely impaired at the stage of viral membrane fusion with the endosomal membrane. Interestingly, the process of viral membrane fusion appears to be a significant target of anti-DENV antibodies during infection in humans, with fusion loop antibodies making up a significant proportion of the population of broadly reactive antibodies that are elicited during infection with DENV (Goncalvez et al., 2004, Lai et al., 2013). Given the convergent nature of the immune response and the prevalence of the E315 variant, it is conceivable that the E315 variant arose as an immune-escape variant to fusion loop antibodies. Indeed, Goncalvez et al. (2004) demonstrated that after 11 cycles of passage in the presence of anti-fusion loop mAb 1A5, an escape mutation was isolated at E317 in DENV-2, further supporting our claim that immune pressures exerted by fusion loop antibodies played a key role in convergent selection for variants at the analogous E315 hotspot locus in DENV-3. Taken together, we conclude that the E315 hotspot variant, despite possibly possessing an immune-escape advantage, is constrained to the intrahost evolutionary system because of the severe defects associated with viral membrane fusion post entry.",

The identification of such convergent immune pressures that appear to result in the selection of prevalent immune-escape variants, especially ones that are constrained by replication defects or fitness costs, could be harnessed for intelligent selection of new candidates and targets for vaccine/drug design. Such snapshots of intrahost DENV diversity help to identify mechanisms driving virus microevolution in human dengue and provide new perspectives in assessing infection outcome, disease pathogenesis, and vaccine/therapeutic efficacy in individuals.",

Plasma and PBMCs are collected from patients for three sequential days during the acute phase of illness, at convalescence (days 14-28) and longitudinally for 18 months. Criteria for identifying dengue-positive cases and for classifying by immune status are as described (Gutierrez et al., 2013, Narvaez et al., 2011). Dengue cases are classified as DF, DHF, or DSS according to the 1997 WHO Dengue Guidelines (Narvaez et al., 2011, WHO, 1997). Thirty-one plasma and 68 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from 77 individuals (including 22 with paired plasma and PBMC samples) were analyzed in this study. The gender identity as well as the age of the patients is listed in Table S1. Extensive epidemiological and clinical data are available for these samples. The sample size for this study was determined by availability of pediatric patient samples for primary and secondary dengue cases caused by DENV-3 within a single endemic year (2009-2010). Subgroups within the 77 patients in the study were selected based on sample type (plasma versus PBMCs), clinical classification (for example, primary versus secondary dengue, Dengue Fever versus Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever and Dengue Shock Syndrome), or gene origin of variation (based on DENV-3 gene annotation).",

Briefly, PBMCs were lysed in TRIzol (Life Technologies), and aqueous phase RNA was extracted after addition of chloroform. Next, 3.5 volumes of Buffer RLT (RNeasy Mini kit; Qiagen) and 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol were added to the RNA solution, and the mixture was applied to an RNeasy column. All washes and RNA elutions were performed as described (RNeasy kit protocol). Viral RNA from plasma samples was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) as described in the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 \u03bcl of RNase-free water containing linear polyacrylamide (1 \u03bcl; Life Technologies), carrier RNA (0.1 \u03bcl; Qiagen), and SUPERase-In (1 \u03bcl; Life Technologies). Twelve RT/PCR amplifications were set up for each sample, with various combinations of forward and reverse primers (Table S4) and reagents from the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen). For each reaction, we used 5 ul of denatured RNA, 17.5 ul of a 2X reaction mix, 0.25 ul each of forward and reverse primers (100 uM), 0.7ul of the enzyme mix, and 11.3 ul of RNase-free water. DENV-3 RNA was reverse-transcribed (50\u00b0C for 60 minutes) and cDNA was amplified as follows: 1 cycle of denaturation (94\u00b0C for 2 minutes), 35 cycles of denaturation (94\u00b0C for 15 seconds), annealing (55\u00b0C for 30 seconds), and extension (68\u00b0C for 3 minutes), and a final extension step (68\u00b0C for 10 minutes)}. The conditions were identical for all amplicons except amplicon 4, for which the extension time was shortened to 1 minute. DENV-3 amplicons were purified on a 1% agarose gel, and DNA was recovered using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). For each sample, PCR amplicons were pooled in equimolar ratios, and indexed libraries were prepared for high-throughput sequencing using the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina).

We introduced four amino acid changes in the C, prM and E sequences in plasmid A (P27S, I286V, V361T and A609V in the DENV-3 polyprotein) to generate infectious clones that were identical in structural protein sequence to the Nicaraguan DENV-3 consensus genome (\u201cWT\u201d). The prM100,101 mutations were inserted by site-directed mutagenesis in plasmid A using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The E315 mutation was synthesized in the context of a plasmid A fragment spanning nucleotides 1-2034 of the DENV-3 genome (Bio Basic, Inc.). Infectious clones for WT, prM100,101 and E315 viruses were derived as described (Messer et al., 2012), with some modifications. All plasmids were individually propagated in E. coli TOP10 competent cells (Invitrogen) and grown on LB plates with selective antibiotics (plasmid A encoding for WT, prM100,101 and E315 was selected with ampicillin, plasmids B and C with kanamycin, and plasmid D with chloramphenicol) at 30\u00b0C for 24 hours. Sequences of colony-purified plasmids were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and restriction digests were set up as follows: plasmid A with SpeI, AhdI and BsmBI yielding a 2.0-kb fragment; plasmid B with BglI and BsmBI yielding a 1.1-kb fragment; plasmid C with BglI yielding a 3.9-kb fragment; and plasmid D with BglI and BsmbI yielding a 3.0-kb fragment. Fragments were gel-purified using a MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), mixed in equimolar ratios, and ligated with T4 ligase (NEB) for 2 hours at 16\u00b0C. Full-length transcripts of DENV-3 cDNA constructs were generated in vitro as described using the mMessage mMachine T7 Kit (Ambion) with the following modifications: (a) 20 \u03bcl reaction mixtures were supplemented with 2 \u03bcl of a 30 mM GTP stock, resulting in a 1.3:1 ratio of cap analog to GTP, and (b) the reaction was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 hours.

The transfected BHK cells were grown in a 75 cm2 flask and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 days. For virus amplification, 2 ml of viral supernatant from BHK cells was used to infect C6/36 cells in a 75 cm2 flask, and 18 ml of C6/36 media (1X MEM + 2% FBS + 1% Pen/Strep + 1% NEAA + 1% L-Glutamine) was added to the cells.

Cells were stained at room temperature with a 1:500 dilution of Zombie Aqua stain (BioLegend), fixed, permeabilized, and stained with a 1:250 dilution of an anti-E (5D4) (Henchal et al., 1982) monoclonal antibody conjugated to Texas Red and a 1:500 dilution of an anti-NS3 (E1D8) (Balsitis et al., 2009) monoclonal antibody conjugated to APC. All experiments were performed in duplicate. The percent of infected cells was measured via flow cytometry on an LSR Fortessa cell analyzer (BD Biosciences), and the data were analyzed using FlowJo 8.8.7 software (TreeStar).",
