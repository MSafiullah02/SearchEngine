As at 22 April 2020, 2,573,143 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in 185 countries and territories around the world [1]. In order to plan intervention strategies aimed at bringing disease outbreaks such as the COVID-19 outbreak under control as well as to monitor disease outbreaks, public health officials depend on insights about key disease transmission parameters that are typically obtained from mathematical or statistical modelling. Examples of key parameters include the reproduction number (R) (average number of infections caused by an infectious individual), and distributions of the generation interval (time between infection events in an infector-infectee pair), serial interval (time between symptom onsets in an infector-infectee pair) and incubation period (time between moment of infection and symptom onset) [2]. Estimates of the reproduction number together with the generation interval distribution can provide insight into the speed with which a disease will spread. On the other hand, estimates of the incubation period distribution can help guide determining appropriate quarantine periods.",

It has recently been shown that ignoring the difference between the serial and generation interval can lead to biased estimates of the reproduction number [8]. More specifically, when the serial interval distribution has larger variance than the generation interval distribution, using the serial interval as a proxy for the generation interval will lead to an underestimation of the effective reproduction number, R. When R is underestimated, this may lead to prevention policies that are insufficient to stop disease spread [8].",

In 2012, Hens et al. [10] proposed using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm to estimate the generation interval distribution from incomplete line list data based on the method by [9] and allowing for auxiliary information to be used in assigning potential infector-infectee pairs. Te Beest et al. [11] used a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach as an alternative to the EM algorithm, to facilitate taking uncertainty related to the dates of symptom onset into account. In this paper, we use a MCMC approach to estimate, next to the serial interval distribution, the generation interval distribution upon specification of the incubation period distribution. We compare the impact of differences among previous estimates of the incubation period distribution for COVID-19.",

The first step updates the missing links v(i)missing and the second step updates the parameter vector \u0398\n1, i.e. the parameters of the generation interval distribution. We assume that both the generation interval and the incubation period are gamma distributed, i.e. f(x; \u0398\n1) \u2261 \u0393(\u03b1\n1, \u03b2\n1) and k(\u03b4; \u0398\n2) \u2261 \u0393(\u03b1\n2, \u03b2\n2). The parameter vector \u0398\n2 is fixed to (\u03b1\n2 = 3.45; \u03b2\n2 = 0.66), corresponding to an incubation period with a mean of 5.2 days and a standard deviation (SD) of 2.8 days [6]. Minimally informative uniform priors are assigned to the parameters of the generation interval distribution, i.e. \u03b1\n1\n~ U(0,30) and \u03b2\n1\n~ U(0,20). For cases with multiple potential infectors, the possible links v(i)missing are assigned equal prior probabilities. The missing links are updated using an independence sampler, whereas \u0398\n1 is updated using a random-walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a uniform proposal distribution [13]. We evaluate the posterior distribution using 3,000,000 iterations of which the first 500,000 are discarded as burn-in. Thinning is applied by taking every 200th iteration. The mean and variance of the generation interval distribution are monitored within the MCMC chain. Posterior point estimates are given by the 50% percentiles of the converged MCMC chain. CrIs are given by the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles of the converged MCMC chain. The serial interval distribution is obtained by simulating 1,000,000 draws from h(z; \u0398\n1, \u0398\n2).

When the incubation period is larger, it is expected that these proportions will be higher and when it is smaller, they are expected to be lower. Hence, a large proportion of transmission appears to occur before symptom onset, which is an important point to consider when planning intervention strategies. It is worth noting that the outbreak data we used were collected in the presence of intervention measures such as case isolation and quarantining of identified contacts. This means that our estimates do not necessarily reflect the natural epidemiology of COVID-19, but instead reflect what is observed in the presence of these intervention measures. It is expected that these measures reduce the proportion of symptomatic transmission, which implies that a high proportion of infections is likely to have occurred before symptom onset because isolation prevents symptomatic transmission.",
