Two parameters were estimated and evaluated for the cases registered in Rond\u00f4nia-Brazil, between March 20 and April 22. The basic reproduction rate did not remain constant during the period, showing variations eventually due to social behavior. The results show that the increase in the proportion of testing to about 56% provided a significant decrease in the confirmed cases since the expansion of the tested cases beyond the current testing criterion (20%) would help to identify and isolate also mild and moderate cases, generally referred to as asymptomatic. : medRxiv preprint [16] Vigil\u00e2ncia em Sa\u00fade -Edi\u00e7\u00e3o 37 -Boletim di\u00e1rio sobre coronav\u00edrus em Rond\u00f4nia -Governo do Estado All rights reserved.

In this work, unlike traditional SEIR modeling, we chose to classify those infected, recovered and deceased in two groups, those from tested and untested groups. Thus, the parameter is introduced to quantify the proportion of individuals tested, so that in the computer simulation phase it is possible to evaluate the effect of the testing strategy on the results obtained. Therefore, the number of infected individuals tested will increase with the number of exposed individuals who have undergone incubation and decrease with those who have recovered or died, according to the mortality rate and the average period of infection 1/ . In the obtained equation, it can be demonstrated, using the method of the subsequent generation matrix [4] , that the basic rate of reproduction is defined by the 0 ( ) = / , it may vary over time, since it is assumed that the rate of effective contacts ( ) depends on the strategy of social isolation or the use of collective masks.

And, despite testing costs, increased testing can bring economic benefits if used in conjunction with selective isolation monitoring and implementation tools. During the period evaluated, according to the testing criteria, we conservatively estimated that the proportion of infected people tested was 20%, and according to the results obtained for the proposed model, its beneficial effects become very significant from about 56% of the infected population, thus including, in addition to all severe and critical cases, more mild and moderate cases in the testing criteria.",

For > 0.4, the number of accumulated cases decreases, since, in mathematical modeling, after confirmation of infection, the individual is segregated from the population preventing the transmission of COVID-19. This decreasing rate of effective contact evidences, in the model, the need to change the testing criteria seeking to increase the proportion of known infected individuals and isolating them. One should note that for the proposed model, as shown in Figure 6, the most considerable decline in the number of accumulated cases starts at approximately = 0.56, providing a practical scientific parameter for the establishment of new testing strategies and criteria established together with logistical restrictions of availability and costs. Despite testing costs, from an economic point of view, the increase in the proportion of testing can be an essential tool in monitoring and implementing selective isolation.",

Final Remarks The mathematical model proposed in this work to describe the evolution of COVID-19 in the State of Rond\u00f4nia, Brazil, considering the average periods of infection, incubation, and testing criteria obtained in the international literature, demonstrated good qualitative and quantitative adherence to the official data of confirmed cases. In this model, the basic reproduction rate ( 0 ) varies with time due to the social behavior of individuals, decreasing with the increase in isolation or the use of homemade masks, and influenced by the logistical flow of testing, as logistical availability of test kits. Still, the temporal evolution of the number of tested and untested individuals are counted separately, according to the testing criteria established to consider the effect of the testing proportion.",

It is noteworthy that in this modeling, the death count of infected individuals not tested should be added to the accumulated cases since, in practice, after death under suspicion, these individuals undergo testing confirming the infection, making them known. 3. Resultados e Discussion As in all mathematical modeling, values should be estimated or arbitrated for the model parameters based on simplifying hypotheses and scientific evidence. In addition to the parameters defined in Section 2.3 obtained from estimates in the literature, initially, the proportion of individuals tested was estimated at 20% ( = 0.2), that is, the clinical and epidemiological testing criteria regularly include 20% of all infected individuals in the studied region. In Rond\u00f4nia, according to the daily bulletin of the State Health Agency [16], as of 04/21/2020, there were 223 infected, 1220 discarded and 115 awaiting results, totaling 1558 tests performed, including 4 deaths.
