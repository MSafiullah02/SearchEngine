The HIVE Study was based on the original Tecumseh Study of Respiratory Illness6 with several key modifications to illness surveillance and to laboratory methods for identification of respiratory viruses. While respiratory virus infections in general could be studied, the primary objective was to estimate the effectiveness of influenza vaccines using a cohort design for comparison with studies using the test-negative design (TND). Under the TND, specimens are collected from participants who meet a respiratory illness case definition, and vaccination frequency is compared between those who test positive for influenza and those who test negative.12 The TND is focused on those individuals with illnesses severe enough to seek care, which reduces bias due to differential care-seeking behaviour but misses milder presentations of respiratory virus illnesses.13\u201315 The use of a prospective cohort design has allowed inclusion of these mild illnesses in evaluations of vaccine effectiveness. Here we report on the first phase of the HIVE Study, conducted from 2010 through 2016.",

Each household received a calendar at enrollment to assist with recording illness onset dates. When illnesses were reported, the household was contacted by study staff to schedule a clinic visit for sample collection. At illness visits for ARI meeting the case definition, trained research staff collected nasal and throat swabs (or nasal swabs only for participants <3 years of age) for detection of influenza and other respiratory viruses.

The household may be an effective place to accomplish this goal due to the high proportion of transmission estimated to occur in this setting. We have used standard epidemiologic methods to estimate serial intervals by virus type and to identify household and individual level characteristics associated with secondary infection risk.32 These methods remain susceptible to misclassification of a transmission event, as infections are generally linked retrospectively based on the time between onset of each illness and viral type and subtype despite continued risk of infection from the community. We have attempted to address this potential for misclassification in two ways. First, it is now possible using next-generation sequencing to differentiate the two types of transmission on the basis of genetic similarity as we have demonstrated with influenza A viruses.33 Second, we have adapted individual-based transmission models to account for risk of infection from both the community and the household and to allow for chains of transmission.34",

Using multiple sources, including participant medical records, to document influenza vaccination status and regular serologic sampling are major strengths of the cohort. The number of participants that have been prospectively followed for multiple years has enabled multi-year studies of immune response to infection and vaccination, studies that are increasingly important for understanding how individual influenza immunity evolves over time.37 The illness sampling strategy requires participant symptom reporting. It is therefore important to note that subclinical infections are not captured by illness sampling, as this would require routine swabs in symptom-free individuals.

It now examines the incidence, etiology and determinants of influenza and other respiratory pathogens.We recruited 2850 individuals from 652 households who have participated in at least one year of active surveillance from June 2010\u2013May 2016. Of these, 1686 (59%) individuals were children <18 years old at enrollment. Additional recruitment and study follow-up is currently ongoing.Households were contacted weekly to ascertain incident ARI seasonally (approximately October\u2013May) from 2010\u20132014 and year-round beginning in October 2014. Blood specimens were collected from participants \u226513 years of age at up to two time points each year. A total of 417 (64%) households participated for more than one season. Illnesses are now followed year round.We collected longitudinal data on demographics, health history, influenza vaccination status and ARI incidence. We collected specimens to detect occurrence by RT-PCR of influenza and other respiratory viruses and serum to determine antibody titres to hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Specimens are archived.Investigators interested in learning more about the HIVE Study as well as data and specimen availability are welcome to email the study investigators. \n\n",
