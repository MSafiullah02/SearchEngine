Meece et al. analyzed 27 polymorphic microsatellite markers of 112 clinical, veterinary, and environmental Blastomyces isolates, mostly from Wisconsin. They demonstrated that isolates could be placed in either of two distinct genetic groups [2]. Later, Brown et al. compared 7 nuclear loci among 78 clinical and environmental Blastomyces isolates representing a wider geographic range [3]. These authors confirmed distinct genetic groups among Blastomyces dermatitidis. Furthermore, they invoked molecular taxonomic criteria to suggest that one of these genetic groups represented a cryptic species, which they named Blastomyces gilchristii. Furthermore, their analysis suggested that B. gilchristii was the predominant species in northwestern Ontario and Wisconsin [3], both areas of hyperendemicity [4, 5]. The ecologic and clinical implications of this genetic distinction are currently unknown and merit further study to assess clinical, virulence, and treatment differences.",

Recent work has focused on further elucidating the \u201ctrue\u201d range of Coccidioides, and soil samples from Washington and Utah have both been found to harbor this fungal species [19]. Genetic characterization of samples from these samples using molecular clocks suggests Coccidioides has been present in these locations for a significant amount of time rather than being newly imported [20]. The spread of the organism to these locations may be secondary to the ability of Coccidioides endospores to survive for long periods of time following aerosolization. In contrast, recent analysis of the Coccidioides genome has suggested these organisms are not soil saprophytes but have instead evolved to remain associated with their dead animal hosts in the soil\u2014findings suggesting a possible rodent reservoir\u2014although this hypothesis has not yet been definitely proven [21].",

In addition, there are two other members of the genus, Emmonsia parva and Emmonsia crescens; these do not cause disseminated disease, but rather cause a distinct clinical syndrome called adiaspiromycosis. This granulomatous lung disease is caused by the host response to so-called adiaspores, enormous, sessile cells that follow transformation from inhaled conidia [32]. Infection with dimorphic Emmonsia spp. is also presumed to follow inhalation of conidia; however, instead of forming adiaspores, the conidia transform to yeast-like cells capable of replication, extra-pulmonary dissemination, and disease [31\u2022]. The taxonomic arrangement of the group is currently in flux, complicated by the fact that the type species, E. parva, appears more related to Blastomyces spp. than to E. crescens [33].",

The CF test allows a more precise evaluation of the patient\u2019s response to treatment but cross-reactions with H. capsulatum antigens can occur. At present, paracoccidioidomycosis antigen testing is not available as a routine diagnostic test although several reports have described the detection of P. brasiliensis antigen in urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and bronchoalveolar fluid samples [70]. Others have noted that antigen levels in serum diminish or even disappear during successful treatment [71].",

Up to two thirds of individuals with penicilliosis test positive for galactomannan [82]. Although mass spectrometry is increasingly used in the identification of medically important fungal infections, a recent study found that none out of 28 T. marneffei isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) [83]. This was because the identification software did not include T. marneffei, but even once included, sensitivity was only 86 %. Nested PCR (of whole blood or tissue biopsies) has been shown to be useful in expediting the diagnosis of T. marneffei. More recently, a study found that a real-time PCR had a slightly improved sensitivity (77 %) compared to nested PCR (66 %) in the detection of T. marneffei in whole blood [80].",

In addition, a systematic review of all humans and animal cases of sporotrichosis reported in the literature from 1898 found three regions to be most endemic: Brazil (5814 cases), China (3299 cases), and South Africa (3154 cases) [87]. Sporothrix brasiliensis is confined to Brazil, Sporothrix globosa to South America and Asia, and Sporothrix schenckii sensu stricto has a worldwide distribution (Fig. 1) [86]. Of the 14,000 cases documented, most occurred within outbreaks (involving between 5 and 3069 cases). There are currently two ongoing outbreaks: (i) an outbreak of S. brasiliensis in south-east Brazil that is a zoonosis transmitted by contact with infected cats [88]. This Sporothrix is thought to multiply in the cats\u2019 saliva and then be transferred to the claws during licking. Both scratches and bites can thus transmit S. braziliensis to humans and dogs. Phylogenetic and geographic analyses support the idea that the S. braziliensis outbreak occurred in South Eastern Brazil following a habitat shift from plants to cats [89, 90]. (ii) An outbreak of S. globosa in Jilin, north-east China, that is a sapronosis likely related to the fungus growing in fermenting offcuts from corn [87]. The increased temperature induced by fermentation is hypothesized to favor the growth of the more pathogenic yeast form. The fact that farmers typically carry large bundles of this decomposing corn in their arms bringing it into contact with their faces is thought to explain why 92 % of skin lesions in this, but not other, outbreaks have occurred on the face [87].\n",
