Second, positive anal swab but negative throat swab was observed in two turn-positive patients (patient 5 and 6), and the diagnostic value of anal swab test in late stage of infection requires further investigation. Meanwhile, fomite transmission and environmental contamination by COVID-19 patients should not be ignored. [6] [7] [8] Imaging examination and qRT-PCR results were sometimes inconsistent, and therefore, a combination of these methods should be used for diagnoses. 8 Four of the turn-positive patients (patient [1] [2] [3] [4] were a family suggesting that the occurrence of turn-positive patients in a family cluster is a nonnegligible phenomenon. Furthermore, we should consider the possibility that the turn-positive patients were not completely cured the first time and were discharged based on a false-negative diagnostic test. To avoid false-negative diagnosis of positive patients, diagnostic tests with high specificity and sensitivity are urgently needed. Finally, nonorganic insomnia and increased anxiety was observed in two turn-positive patients (patient 2 and 3) indicating that timely mental health care for the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients is urgently needed, 9 especially turn-positive patients who require re-hospitalization and medical observation for 14 days after discharge. 10 As a new infectious disease, the pathogenesis and epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection are still not well understood. 1, 10 Further studies on turn-positive patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 will deepen our understanding of the whole process of occurrence, development, and transformation of COVID-19.",
