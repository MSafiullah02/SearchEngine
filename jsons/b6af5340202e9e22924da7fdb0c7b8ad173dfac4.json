            "text": "Remyelination failure plays an important role in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We now report actively demyelinating lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis are associated with increased glial expression of fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9), which we demonstrate inhibits myelination and remyelination in vitro. This inhibitory activity is associated with the appearance of multi-branched 'pre-myelinating' MBP + /PLP + oligodendrocytes that interact with axons but fail to assemble myelin sheaths; an oligodendrocyte phenotype described previously in chronically demyelinated multiple sclerosis lesions. This inhibitory activity is not due to a direct effect of FGF9 on cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage but is mediated by factors secreted by astrocytes. Transcriptional profiling and functional validation studies demonstrate that these include effects dependent on increased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-sensitive proteases, enzymes more commonly associated with extracellular matrix remodelling. Further, we found that FGF9 induces expression of Ccl2 and Ccl7, two pro-inflammatory chemokines that contribute to recruitment of microglia and macrophages into multiple sclerosis lesions. These data indicate glial expression of FGF9 can initiate a complex astrocyte-dependent response that contributes to two distinct pathogenic pathways involved in the development of multiple sclerosis lesions. Namely, induction of a pro-inflammatory environment and failure of remyelination; a combination of effects predicted to exacerbate axonal injury and loss in patients.",

However, in multiple sclerosis this repair mechanism frequently fails resulting in chronically demyelinated plaques of gliotic scar tissue (Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2008) . This has profound pathophysiological consequences as loss of myelin not only disrupts axonal function per se, but also compromises the physical integrity of affected axons by increasing their susceptibility to inflammatory mediators (Redford et al., 1997) and disrupting trophic support provided by myelinating oligodendrocytes (F\u00fc nfschilling et al., 2012) . This combination of effects will exacerbate axonal loss in patients (Nave, 2010; Franklin et al., 2012) and restoring endogenous remyelination is now considered an attractive strategy to prevent further axonal damage and restore function (Irvine and Blakemore, 2008; Duncan et al., 2009; Deshmukh et al., 2013) . However achieving this goal in multiple sclerosis requires a far better understanding of why remyelination fails and how this is related to the inflammatory component of the disease.",

However, the efficacy of this endogenous repair mechanism declines with disease progression (Patani et al., 2007; Goldschmidt et al., 2009) . Studies in rodents suggest this may be due to the cumulative effects of repeated or sustained episodes of inflammatory demyelination on OPC recruitment or survival (Linington et al., 1992) , which will be exacerbated by effects related to normal ageing (Shen et al., 2008) . Nonetheless in patients the mechanisms responsible for failure of remyelination remain obscure. The continued presence of significant numbers of OPCs in many lesions suggests this involves factors that inhibit OPC differentiation (Scolding et al., 1999; Chang et al., 2002; Wolswijk, 2002; Kuhlmann et al., 2008) , although effects reducing OPC recruitment and/or survival will also impact on remyelination efficacy (Piaton et al., 2009) .",

Convincing arguments are available to support a role for each of these in lesion development, but their relative importance with respect to failure of remyelination remains unclear.

In the context of multiple sclerosis, previous studies focused on the possible involvement of FGF2 (Sarchielli et al., 2008) , a pleiotrophic growth factor expressed by macrophages and microglia in active white matter lesions (Clemente et al., 2011) . However, it is difficult to deduce the functional significance of increased expression of FGF2, as it can exert both potentially beneficial as well as detrimental effects in the adult CNS. On one hand it may limit axonal loss by virtue of its neuroprotective properties (Ruffini et al., 2001; Rottlaender et al., 2011) or enhance remyelination by supporting the expansion and specification of OPCs derived from neural stem cells (McKinnon et al., 1990; Azim et al., 2012) . However, any benefit provided by these effects are thought to be negated by other effects that may inhibit OPC differentiation and compromise remyelination (Bansal, 2002; Butt and Dinsdale, 2005; Tobin et al., 2011; Azim et al., 2012; Mierzwa et al., 2013) . Unravelling the pathophysiological significance of FGF2 is complicated further by expression of other FGF family members in the CNS that signal using the same FGF receptor (FGFR) isoforms (Tacer et al., 2010; Mohan et al., 2014) . These include FGF9 that is expressed constitutively by many adult neurons, and mimics the ability of FGF2 to suppress myelin protein expression by differentiating OPCs (Cohen and Chandross, 2000) ; an observation that led us to investigate whether it might also contribute to lesion formation in multiple sclerosis.",

For immunohistochemistry tissue sections were washed twice with PBS, thereafter sections were treated with 0.6% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min and with blocking buffer (1% normal donkey serum, 0.1% Triton TM X-100, 0.05% Tween) for 1 h. Sections were incubated with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4 C: rabbit anti-OLIG2 (1:500, Millipore), and rabbit anti-GFAP (1:2000, DakoCytomation). Secondary biotinylated antibodies (Vector Laboratories, 1:500) were applied for 2 h at room temperature, followed by ABC complex reagent (Vector Labs) for 30 min. Colour reaction was performed with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole. Luxol Fast blue and haematoxylin and eosin staining were performed according to standard protocols.",

In agreement with previous studies (Todo et al., 1998) FGF9 was expressed constitutively by neurons and occasionally by glia and cells associated with the vasculature (Fig. 1A) . Neurons exhibited a punctate pattern of cytoplasmic staining that was superimposed on a background of extracellular immunoreactivity, which may be due to FGF9 in axons and/or dendrites, or bound to components of the extracellular matrix. FGF9 immunoreactivity was far less pronounced in subcortical white matter in which weak staining was observed in scattered neurons, and less frequently in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Fig. 1B) . This contrasted to the situation in multiple sclerosis which was associated with a generalized increase of FGF9 immunoreactivity in white matter, in particular in active lesions, defined by the abundance of macrophages, containing early myelin degradation products ( Fig. 1C and D) . Staining was most pronounced in oligodendrocytes, although astrocytes and other cells, putatively identified as OPCs were also immunoreactive (Fig. 1F) . This was not only seen in acute active lesions, but was also observed, albeit to a lesser extent, at the rim of slowly expanding white matter lesions from patients with longstanding progressive disease ( Fig. 1 G-I) . Normalappearing white matter exhibited variable immunoreactivity in oligodendrocyte-like cells, astrocytes and vessel associated cells that were intermediate between that in control white matter and active lesion areas (Fig. 1E ). However, FGF9 immunoreactivity was minimal in the centre of slow expanding white matter lesions apart from occasional weakly staining astrocytes (Fig. 1J) . A similar lack of staining for FGF9 was apparent in chronic inactive lesions (Fig 1K and L) where immunoreactivity for FGF9 was restricted to occasional axonal spheroids, and cells morphologically consistent with being astrocytes and endothelial cells ( Fig. 1M and N) .",

Re-expression of FGF9 in the adult CNS might therefore be expected to have a significant impact on lesion development in multiple sclerosis; a concept supported by the ability of FGF9 to suppress myelin protein expression by OPC (Cohen and Chandross, 2000) . We therefore investigated the effects of adding FGF9 to myelinating cultures derived from embryonic rat spinal cord by immunofluorescence microscopy, a model system that allows us to quantify effects on all stages of the oligodendroglial cell lineage, as well as myelination and neurite outgrowth. FGF9 inhibits myelination in a dose dependent manner ( Fig. 3A and B), 490% inhibition being obtained when FGF9 was present at a concentration of 100 ng/ml (18-28 DIV) ( Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. 2) . Failure of myelination was associated with the appearance of a population of 'premyelinating' oligodendrocytes that exhibited a granular pattern of PLP and MBP immune reactivity in their cytosol. These cells were observed to extend processes that ended in large membrane expansions or alternatively, aligned along and interacted with SMI31 + neurites ( Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. 2) ; an oligodendrocyte phenotype associated with chronically demyelinated multiple sclerosis lesions (Chang et al., 2002) .",

Incorporation of EdU was increased 3-fold in OLIG2 + cells, 4-5-fold in O4 + cells and almost 10-fold in PLP + cells. This effect of FGF9 on the oligodendroglial lineage was reminiscent of that reported for FGF2, a well-characterized OPC mitogen that inhibits OPC differentiation by limiting their ability to drop out of cell cycle. We therefore performed experiments to determine whether this represents a generalized response to FGF signal transduction in this culture system.

Control experiments revealed that although treatment with AraC from 18 to 28 DIV significantly reduced cell proliferation, this had no effect on myelination per se; an observation indicating myelination during this period is performed by a pre-existing pool of non-proliferating OPCs. AraC also eliminated the proliferative response induced by FGF9; however, this failed to abrogate the effect of FGF9 on myelination demonstrating this is independent of its ability to act as a glial mitogen (Fig. 3E) . In contrast to these marked effects on cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage and myelination FGF9 had no effect on neurite density as determined by SMI31 immune reactivity sclerosis are defined by myelin loss and the presence of some macrophages at the lesion border with myelin degradation products (G); there is massive microglia activation at the lesions edge and some immunoreactive cells have macrophage morphology (H). (I) FGF9 immunoreactivity is increased at the edge of slowly expanding white matter lesions from cases of progressive disease. In this case immunoreactivity is associated with axonal spheroids (arrows) and glia (arrowhead). Rim of a slowly expanding lesion from a case of primary progressive multiple sclerosis. (J) The centre of chronic active lesions show very limited astrocytic immunoreactivity for FGF9. (K and L) Inactive lesions show myelin loss with a sharp border towards the periplaque white matter (PPWM) (K) and no immunoreactivity for macrophage antigens (e.g. CD68) within or around the lesion (L). Immunoreactivity for FGF9 across inactive chronic lesions is far lower than in control white matter as seen at the lesion rim (M) where immunoreactivity is associated with an axonal spheroid (arrow) as well as weaker and variable staining of glia (arrowheads). In the centre of the same lesion (N) weak immunoreactivity is seen associated with a single cell, morphologically consistent with an endothelial cell. (K-N) Inactive lesion from a case of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with a duration of 435 years. Scale bar in all panels corresponds to 20 mm. ; MBP (red) reactivity is predominantly associated with myelin sheaths, whereas PLP (green) immunoreactivity is also present in the oligodendrocyte cell body. Treatment with 100 ng/ml FGF9 from 18-28 DIV is associated with the appearance of multi-branched oligodendrocytes that exhibit a granular staining pattern for MBP and PLP in the cell body and fail to generate myelin sheaths. MBP, red; PLP, green; SMI31, blue. Scale bar = 20 mm. Inhibition of myelination by FGF9 in these cultures is dose-dependent (B); myelination was quantified using a MOG-specific antibody as described in the text. This treatment is associated with increased numbers of OLIG2 + (P 5 0.001), NG2 + (P 5 0.01) and AA3 + (P 5 0.01) cells. There was also a trend for O4 + cell numbers to increase, but this did not reach significance (P = 0.055) (C). This increase in OPC numbers was due to proliferation as demonstrated by the presence of increased numbers of OLIG2, O4 and AA3 (PLP/DM20) immunoreactive cells labelled with EdU (DIV 18-22) (D). However, the ability of FGF9 to inhibit myelination is independent of this proliferative response as inhibition of proliferation by cytosine arabinoside (AraC, 20 mM) was unable to abrogate inhibition of myelination by FGF9 (E).

However, as OPCs differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes they sequentially express different high affinity receptors for FGF9. Receptor expression changes from FGFR3 in OPCs to FGFR2 in mature myelinating oligodendrocytes; activation of the latter by FGF9 triggering changes in process outgrowth without affecting expression of myelin proteins (Fortin et al., 2005) . These results were however obtained after short term (48 h) exposure of either early or highly differentiated progenitors to FGF9. This prompted us to investigate the effect of continuous exposure to FGF9 on OPC differentiation. Using A2B5 + progenitor cells immunopurified from the neonatal CNS we confirmed FGF9 is not a mitogen for OPCs during their initial stages of differentiation in Sato's medium (DIV 1-3; Fig. 5A ). However, they subsequently become responsive to its mitogenic potential as later exposure (DIV 4-7) doubles incorporation of EdU (Fig. 5A ). This proliferative response was associated with inhibition of differentiation as demonstrated by analysis of cultures continuously exposed to FGF9 for 7 days; the number of OPCs expressing O4, PLP and MOG being reduced by 30%, 86% and 490%, respectively ( Fig. 5B and C) .",

In fact the converse was true, FGF9 increased the absolute number of O4 + and PLP + cells in these cultures by 37% and 68%, respectively (Fig. 3C) . We reasoned this dichotomy could be explained by an off target effect of FGF9 that compensated for any direct effect of FGF9 on OPC differentiation, but which at the same time might also adversely affect myelination.

            "text": "To identify mechanisms by which FGF9 inhibits myelination we performed a microarray analysis on myelinating cultures (DIV 18) grown in the presence or absence of FGF9 for 24 h. This identified 3262 transcripts differentially regulated by FGF9 (1752 upregulated, 1510 downregulated; fold-change 4 AE1.4; P 5 0.01; Fig. 6 and Table 2 ). Pathway enrichment analysis using the 731 most differentially regulated transcripts (fold change 4 AE2.2; P 5 0.01) identified 17 enriched pathways (P 5 0.05; Fisher's Exact Test; Supplementary Table 1 ). The most highly enriched was the cell cycle pathway, an observation that reflects the proliferative response to FGF9. However three of the four next most enriched pathways are associated with both neurobiological and immune functions (transforming growth factor beta signalling, P = 0.00025; cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, P = 0.00098; Jak-STAT signalling, P = 0.0048); an observation suggesting that in addition to any effect on remyelination increased availability of FGF9 may also modulate immune function within the CNS. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that FGF9 increased expression of a cluster of 'proinflammatory' genes (Ccl7, Cd93, Cd63, Ccl2, Il1rap, Tnfrsf10b and Il1r1) more commonly discussed in the context of innate immunity rather than their neurobiological effects. The relative magnitude of this effect is apparent when significance (log10 P) is plotted against fold-change in expression which highlights the profound effects of FGF9 on expression of Ccl7 (ranking 1; 31-fold increase), Cd93 (ranking 4; 17-fold increase), Il1rap (ranking 55; 5-fold increase) and Ccl2 (ranking 56; 5-fold increase) ( Fig. 6 and Table 2 ). This raises the possibility that in addition to its ability to inhibit (re)myelination, FGF9 may also promote a pro-inflammatory environment in the CNS, a combination of effects predicted to exacerbate axonal injury and loss in multiple sclerosis lesions (Franklin et al., 2012) .",

Cerebellar slices from post-natal Day 2 mouse pups were cultured for 10 days and then demyelinated using LPC for 16 h. Cultures were then allowed to remyelinate over the next 14 days in the presence or absence of FGF9 (100 ng/ml) after which remyelination was assessed using antibodies specific for MOG and PLP to label myelin, and neurofilament (NFH) to label axons. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy shows treatment with FGF9 leads to less remyelination (A) as demonstrated by the reduction in MOG + internodes (red) and PLP + internodes (green) encasing NFH + axons (blue). Scale bar = 10 mm. Remyelination was quantified using image analysis to define co-localization of staining for myelin (PLP + or MOG + ) and axons (NFH + ) (B)-a quantification of myelinated internodes we term the remyelination index (amount of myelin/axon). Irrespective of the antibody used to identify myelinated internodes, treatment with FGF9 (F) reduced remyelination compared to untreated cultures (C).

This strategy revealed FGF9 upregulated astrocytic expression of a number of proteases in particular ADAMTS1, ADAMTS7 and MMP3 (Table 2 and  Supplementary Table 2 ). These mediate a wide range of biological processes including extracellular matrix remodelling which led us to speculate they may adversely affect (re)myelination. This hypothesis received further support when assays using aggrecan as a 'global' substrate for ADAMTS and MMP family members revealed FGF9 significantly increased aggrecanase activity in supernatants harvested from myelinating cultures (Fig. 6B) . To determine whether this protease activity was actively involved in mediating inhibition of myelination we used a cocktail of physiological protease inhibitors (TIMP1, TIMP2 and TIMP3) known to inhibit a wide range of ADAMTS and MMP family members. The inhibitors had no effect on myelination per se but abrogated the inhibitory effect of FGF9 which was reduced by $37% (n = 3; FGF9 versus untreated control, 78.2 AE 5.8% inhibition, P 5 0.01; FGF9 + TIMP versus untreated control, 49.1 AE 11.8 inhibition, not significant) (Fig. 6C) . Induction of TIMP-sensitive proteases therefore makes a significant contribution to the mechanisms by which FGF9 inhibits myelination in this culture system.",

This may be due to incomplete inhibition of the relevant proteases, or alternatively involvement of other factors such as chemokines (Ccl2, Ccl7), IL6/gp130 cytokine family members (Il11, Lif, Cntf) and growth factors (Hbegf, Vgf, Hgf). To explore this Proliferation of immunopurified A2B5 + OPCs cultured in the presence or absence of FGF9. FGF9 is not initially an OPC mitogen (DIV 1-3), but progenitors become responsive as they differentiate (DIV 4-7) (A). This proliferative response is associated with inhibition of OPC differentiation assessed using three stage specific markers (O4, PLP and MOG) (B and C). B provides representative images demonstrating the effect on expression of PLP and MOG. Scale bar = 100 mm. Supernatants from FGF9 treated and untreated neurosphere-derived astrocytes were harvested and added to myelinating cultures in the presence or absence of a neutralizing anti-FGF9 antibody (10 mg/ml) from 18 to 28 DIV (D). Quantifying PLP + myelination reveals the FGF9-specific antibody neutralized the ability of FGF9 to inhibit myelination, but failed to block inhibitory activity present in supernatants harvested from FGF9-treated astrocytes.

For example our validation strategy indicates CCL2 is derived primarily from astrocytes, whereas Has2 is upregulated in some other cell type (Supplementary Table 2 ). To validate this interpretation we determined the concentrations of CCL2 and hyaluronic acid (a surrogate marker for increased HAS2 activity) in supernatants harvested from myelinating cultures and astrocyte monolayers grown in the presence or absence of FGF9 ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . Basal concentrations of CCL2 were similar in myelinating cultures and astrocyte monolayers and upregulated to similar extents, 16 -and 14-fold, respectively, confirming astrocytes were a major source of FGF9-induced CCL2 production. In contrast basal and induced levels of hyaluronic acid were far higher in supernatants harvested from myelinating cultures than astrocyte monolayers indicating astrocytes are not the major cellular source of hyaluronic acid in myelinating cultures. Screening selected candidates such as CCL2, CCL7 and IL11 has, however, as yet failed to identify any that replicate the effects of FGF9. Similarly CNTF, which is downregulated by FGF9, was unable to abrogate the effects of FGF9 (Supplementary Fig. 4 ).",

At these sites induction of FGF9 was observed in GFAP + astrocytes, OLIG2 + and occasionally more mature NOGO-A + oligodendrocytes, a complex cellular response consistently associated with a background of diffuse extracellular immunoreactivity. The latter is attributed to FGF9 binding to heparin sulphate proteoglycans (HSPG) in the extracellular matrix, a property that sequesters its direct biological effects to the immediate vicinity of its site of synthesis (Harada et al., 2009; Goetz and Mohammadi, 2013) . FGF9 expression was far lower in adjacent normal-appearing white matter and largely absent in chronically demyelinated inactive lesions, a pattern that suggests induction represents a localised glial response to ongoing tissue damage. More detailed analysis of lesion biopsies revealed considerable variation in the number of FGF9 immunoreactive glia associated with early active lesions.",

Preliminary studies suggest this is not simply a glial response to T cell mediated inflammation, as increased expression of FGF9 is not observed in animals with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Moreover, FGF9 expression is increased at the active rim of slowly expanding white matter lesions in patients with long standing progressive disease, a site associated with minimal recruitment of lymphocytes from the periphery (Lassmann et al., 2012) . One factor that might contribute to this response is decreased expression of Smad-interacting protein-1 (now known as ZEB2), which suppresses neuronal expression of FGF9 during cortical development (Seuntjens et al., 2009) . Intriguingly, this transcription factor is expressed by oligodendrocytes and plays an essential role in CNS myelination (Weng et al., 2012) , an observation that raises the possibility ZEB2 may also influence oligodendroglial expression of FGF9.",

            "text": "We were initially perplexed by this observation as previous studies failed to report any significant effect of FGF9 on OPC proliferation or differentiation (Fortin et al., 2005). However, this earlier study only examined short term responses of early OPCs or mature oligodendrocytes, whilst in the current study we examined the effect of continuous exposure to FGF9 on differentiating A2B5 + progenitors over a period of 7 days. This revealed that as they differentiate these cells enter a stage in which they become FGF9 sensitive; as demonstrated by their proliferative response that may reflect a developmental switch in expression of FGFR3 to FGFR2 (Fortin et al., 2005) . Re-entry of these isolated progenitors into cell cycle was associated with inhibition of differentiation and a corresponding decrease in the appearance of PLP + OPCs. However the reverse was observed when we explored the effects of FGF9 on the oligodendrocyte lineage in myelinating cultures. In this complex cellular environment FGF9 still acts as an OPC mitogen as demonstrated by EdU labelling studies, but in this case this results in a net increase in PLP + cells. This dichotomy can be explained by off-target effects of FGF9 on other cells in the culture that override or compensate for its direct effect on the differentiation of early progenitors. Possible candidates are astrocyte-derived 'promyelinating' factors such as IL11 and LIF (Ishibashi et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2006) that we found are upregulated by FGF9 in myelinating cultures. However despite any potential benefit this may provide, myelination was nonetheless inhibited by an astrocyte-dependent mechanism that inhibits differentiation MBP/PLP + precursors into mature myelination-competent oligodendrocytes. Transcriptional profiling revealed inhibition of myelination was associated with changes in gene expression affecting several pathways previously implicated as causes of remyelination failure in multiple sclerosis, in particular those involving interactions with components of the extracellular matrix (e.g. Adamts1, Has2, Chst3, Adamst9, Fn1, Cd44, Mmp3, Mmp11, Mmp15). These include CD44/hyaluronan signalling (Tuohy et al., 2004; Back et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2012; Bugiani et al., 2013) , as well as effects associated with increased availability of chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (Siebert et al., 2011) and fibronectin (Stoffels et al., 2013) . The latter is of interest as fibronectin inhibits myelination via an integrin-dependent mechanism that disrupts vesicular traffic to sites of myelin assembly (Maier et al., 2005; Siskov\u00e1 et al., 2006 Siskov\u00e1 et al., , 2009 ; an effect that may contribute to the appearance of granular staining for MBP and PLP in the cytosol of oligodendrocytes in FGF9-treated myelinating cultures. It was also noted that processes extended by these cells appear to be able to interact with neurites but nonetheless fail to myelinate; a phenotype reminiscent of that seen in chronically demyelinated multiple sclerosis lesions (Chang et al., 2002) .",

The activity of these metalloproteinases is regulated to differing extents by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), a family of four physiological protease inhibitors. This was exploited to demonstrate increased expression/activity of TIMP-sensitive proteases contributes to the inhibitory effect of FGF9 on myelination. Further studies are now required to determine the relative contribution of specific proteases and their pathophysiological substrates. Our inability to completely abrogate the inhibitory effect of FGF9 on myelination using a combination of TIMPs may indicate additional pathways contribute to its downstream effects on myelination. However, it should be noted that the inhibitor cocktail used in this study only inhibited aggrecanase activity in cell culture supernatants by $50% raising the possibility more complete inhibition could fully abrogate the effect of FGF9.

These chemokines are expressed in multiple sclerosis lesions where they are thought to be involved in recruiting macrophages and microglia (McManus et al., 1998) . This ability of FGF9 to induce this 'pro-inflammatory' response and at the same time inhibit remyelination has major implications with respect to its role in disease pathogenesis. Traditionally multiple sclerosis is viewed as an inflammatory disease driven by autoimmune response in the periphery, but immunomodulatory treatments that target this response and disease activity in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis generally fail to benefit patients with progressive forms of the disease. These immune modulatory treatments are thought to fail because accumulation of disability in these patients is driven by inflammatory mechanisms sequestered within the CNS that are largely independent of T cell recruitment from the periphery (Lassmann et al., 2012) . Our data suggest glial expression of FGF9 will contribute to this scenario by virtue of its effects on astrocytes that inhibit remyelination and generate a pro-inflammatory chemokine response; a combination of effects predicted to exacerbate axonal loss while simultaneously recruiting more inflammatory cells into the developing lesion (Franklin et al., 2012) . In summary our data identify FGF signalling in astrocytes as a novel target for both regenerative and anti-inflammatory therapies in multiple sclerosis. ",
