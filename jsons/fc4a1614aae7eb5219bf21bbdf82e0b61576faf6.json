Once activated in situ there, B cells begin to proliferate and form a germinal centre where longerlasting, high-affinity responses are induced (2, 3) .",

This is achieved by a number of mechanisms such as antibody feedback (13) and follicle-resident CD8 + T cells (14, 15) . However, in this article we will focus on the contribution of Foxp3-expressing T reg cells to the control of the humoral response. Various phenotypes of T cells have immunosuppressive properties, but the best understood are CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + T reg cells. These cells are critical to the regulation of humoral immunity as both mice and humans with loss of Foxp3 function have raised levels of serum antibodies (16, 17) . More recently, it has also become clear that T reg cells are able to travel into the B-cell follicle and directly regulate the germinal centre response (18) (19) (20) .",

CD25-based depletion of T reg cells leads to increased autoantibody production in a murine model of arthritis (37) or in lupus-prone NZB/NZW F 1 mice (38) . Accordingly, transfer of ex-vivo-expanded T reg cells into NZB/NZW F 1 mice ameliorates disease (39) . The maintenance of peripheral anergy in autoreactive B cells is a critical tolerance mechanism, preventing activation of autoreactive B cells (8, 40, 41) . In the absence of T reg cells, normally anergic, dsDNA-specific B cells lose their anergic phenotype and, following provision of T-cell help, produce anti-ds-DNA antibodies. Transfer of CD25 + T reg cells prevents this process (42) . Correspondingly, specific T reg -cell depletion via diphtheria toxin also leads to a loss of B-cell anergy (43) . Glucocorticoid-induced TNFRrelated protein (GITR) is expressed at high levels on T reg cells and is important in their suppressor functions; depletion of GITR-expressing T reg cells also leads to the development of anti-myosin autoantibodies and myocarditis (44) .",

However, Foxp3 + cells were more resistant to deletion, ensuring that the ratio of antigen-specific Foxp3 + cells to Foxp3cells is higher for self-antigens (49) .",

Total loss of CTLA-4 expression has profound effects on humoral immunity as effector T cells produce large amounts of IL-4 leading to hyper-IgE production (82) . In T reg -cell-specific CTLA-4 cKO mice, we have also previously reported hyper-IgE and enhanced IgG in the serum (52) . More recently we have observed high levels of spontaneous development of T fh cells and germinal centres in CTLA-4 cKO mice, similar to those seen in scurfy mice, suggesting that, in the absence of CTLA-4, other T reg -cell effector mechanisms are insufficient to regain control of humoral immunity despite a large number of T reg /T freg cells (20) (J.

However, in vivo, the blocking effect of large doses of CTLA-4-Ig may not be an accurate correlate for the in vivo function of membranebound CTLA-4 found on T reg cells, which appears to act primarily via downregulation of surface expression of CD80/ CD86 on DCs and B cells (50, 52) .",

In addition to its role in the control of CD80 and CD86 expression, CTLA-4 may also directly inhibit the function of CD80/CD86-expressing DCs by inducing nuclear translocation of the transcription factor Foxo3, leading to a loss of IL-6 expression (93) or modulating tryptophan catabolism by induction of the immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) (94) .",

In BALB/c mice, anti-parietal autoantibodies and anti-cardiac troponin I autoantibodies are produced (98, 99) , and in C57BL/6 mice, development of lupus-like disease and arthritis occurs, while anti-nuclear antibody levels are enhanced in autoimmunity-prone Fc\u03b3RII-deficient mice (100) . This increase in autoimmunity and autoantibody production may be because of the observed expansion of T fh cells in either PD-1-deficient mice or following PD-1 blocking (101, 102) . However, it seems that this dysregulation also results in a loss of quality as the generated T fh cells may have reduced IL-4 and IL-21 expression leading to reductions in the numbers of long-lasting plasma cells (103) and the production of large amounts of low-affinity IgA in the Peyer's patches that fail to properly control the gut microbiota (104) .",

Given its clear effects on antibody production, we suggest that CTLA-4 is the core mechanism of T reg -cell function controlling the formation of germinal centres. However, T freg cells, similar to T reg cells from other sites where stimulatory signals are in excess (81), may utilize a range of other suppressive mechanisms such as IL-10 and TGF\u03b2, thereby allowing them to play an important role in the fine-tuning of established germinal centre responses (Fig. 2) .",

In the future, it will be imperative to develop new methods that allow the preferential depletion or expansion of antigen-specific T reg cells following vaccination, allowing the enhancement or negation of antigen-specific responses while maintaining immune homeostasis by preserving the polyclonal T reg -cell repertoire. 66 Foxp3 + T reg cells in humoral immunity",
