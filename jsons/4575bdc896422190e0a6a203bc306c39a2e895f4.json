The results clearly suggest that this phenomenon exists among individuals with mental illness. However, as the data from this investigation stems from standard clinical practice where the patients were not systematically assessed for pandemic-related psychopathology, we cannot speak to its overall prevalence. Nevertheless, we believe that our findings underline the necessity of taking urgent action to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with mental disorders. A low-cost intervention would be to simply discuss the ongoing pandemic and its societal consequences with patients seeking care in psychiatric settings -as this may lead to relief of pandemic-related symptoms via general comforting, and clarification of misunderstandings/false beliefs regarding the pandemic.",
