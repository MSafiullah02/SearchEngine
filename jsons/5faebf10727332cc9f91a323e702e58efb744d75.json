The ACE2 gene is expressed in SARS-CoV-2 target cells, including Type II Pneumocytes (Ziegler, 2020), and is activated by interferons. Viral RNA was also detected in breast milk , raising the possibility that ACE2 expression is under the control of cytokines through the JAK-STAT pathway. Here we show that Ace2 expression in mammary tissue is induced during pregnancy and lactation, which coincides with the establishment of a candidate enhancer. The prolactin-activated transcription factor STAT5 binds to tandem sites that coincide with activating histone enhancer marks and additional transcription components. The presence of pan JAK-STAT components in mammary alveolar cells and in Type II Pneumocytes combined with the autoregulation of both STAT1 and STAT5 suggests a prominent role of cytokine signaling pathways in cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2.",

A study in pneumocytes demonstrated that ACE2 expression is induced by interferons (Ziegler, 2020) , possibly through the transcription factors Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) 1 and 2, as the authors suggest. The STAT family is comprised of seven transcription factors (STAT1, 2, 3, 4, 5A, 5B and 6) that are activated by type I and II cytokines through their respective receptors and the JAK/TYK2 family of tyrosine kinases (Stark and Darnell, 2012) . Although each cytokine receptor has some preference for individual STAT members, it has become clear that any given cytokine can activate several, if not all, STAT members, which subsequently bind to a shared DNA motif, the gamma interferon activated sequence (GAS) (Hennighausen and Robinson, 2008) . This permits individual genes to be activated by more than one cytokine through different receptors and several STAT family members.",

SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in breast milk of infected patients suggesting that the virus can enter differentiated mammary alveolar cells and be vertically transmitted through breast feeding. Based on the overlapping activities of JAK-STAT components and their potential redundancy, it is likely that ACE2 expression is activated by a wide range of cytokines through STATs 1, 2, 3 and 5. This has profound implications for strategies to mitigate ACE2 levels. Interfering with individual STATs will result in the compensational recruitment of other STAT members to cytokine receptors (Cui et al., 2007) with all its transcriptional consequences (Hennighausen and Robinson, 2008; Shin et al., 2016) .",

We have tested this premise and explored whether Ace2 is activated in mouse mammary tissue through STAT transcription factors. Gene expression in mammary epithelium during pregnancy and lactation is activated by prolactin through STAT5 (Liu et al., 1997) . We observed an approximately 100-fold increase of Ace2 mRNA during pregnancy and lactation ( Figure 1B ), which coincided with the establishment of a putative enhancer (Figure 2A ). Tmprss2 mRNA levels were similar throughout pregnancy and lactation ( Figure 1B ), suggesting that its expression is not under overt control of the JAK/STAT pathway. STAT5 was recruited to two distinct GAS (bona fide STAT binding motifs) in the candidate enhancer and cooccupancy of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), nuclear factor 1 B (NFIB) and mediator complex subunit 1 (MED1) is likely not through their individual recognition motifs but through contacting STAT5. The presence of H3K4me1 enhancer marks, H3K27ac marks and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy further supports the validity of this regulatory region. Of note, no STAT3 occupancy was observed, suggesting a predominance of STAT5. In contrast to mammary tissue, limited STAT5 binding was observed in liver and no STAT5 and STAT3 binding was observed in kidney tissue ( Figure 2B ). The putative autoregulatory enhancer in the Stat1 gene served as a positive control for STAT binding ( Figure 2C ).",
