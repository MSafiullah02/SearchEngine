The presentation ranges from a mild and transient elevation of aminotransferases to acute hepatitis and liver liver failure [1]. These viruses should be considered as possible etiologic agents in patients who have acute liver injury and whose serologic markers for the classic hepatotropic viruses are not indicative of an active infection [1]. In the present chapter, we review the clinical manifestations and the potential for immune-mediated liver injury associated with several of these viruses (see summary Table 12.2).\n\n",

Expression of different combinations of these proteins allows the virus to establish different forms of infection [2]. Cell entry and translocation of EBV particles to the nucleus is confirmed by detection of the EBV genome in isolated nuclei [3]. While B cells in the oropharynx may be the primary site of infection, resting memory B cells are thought to be the site of persistence of EBV throughout the body. EBV has evolved several strategies to evade immune system recognition and to establish latent infection in memory B cells, where it resides lifelong without any consequence in the majority of individuals [4]. After infecting B lymphocytes, the linear EBV genome becomes circular, forming an episome, which usually remains latent in these B cells. Only ten of the viral proteins are expressed in latently infected B cells in vitro. Limited gene expression during latency ensures successful escape from cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) recognition [2]. EBV shares the tendency of establishing latency in the host with other herpes viruses [2]. Viral replication is spontaneously activated in only a small percentage of latently infected B cells [5].",

The most common is leukocytosis, which appears in 70 % of cases, predominantly as lymphocytosis and monocytosis, as well as mild thrombocytopenia in up to 50 % of affected individuals. EBV-specific IgG and IgM antibodies directed against the viral capsid antigens (VCA), the early antigens (EBV anti-D and anti-R), the nuclear antigen (EBVNA), and soluble complement-fixing antigens (anti-S) are used for viral detection [1]. The \u201cmonospot\u201d test that detects heterophil antibodies is sensitive but not specific. In the vast majority of cases, there is no indication for liver biopsy, but when performed there may be portal and sinusoidal mononuclear cell infiltration with focal hepatic necrosis or fatty infiltration [1, 7]. Specifically, the diagnosis of EBV hepatitis is established based on the combination of elevated aminotransferases, serology compatible with active EBV infection, typical findings on liver biopsy, and demonstration of the presence of the viral genome in liver tissue by various molecular methods.",

EBV interacts with NK cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages, as well as with epithelial cells that are relevant to viral resistance [4]. The tonsils are the primary site for EBV infection. EBV triggers monocyte TLRs, inducing maturation of DCs, which activate CD16\u2013CD56 bright NK cells via IL12. NK cells hamper pathogen entry at mucosal sites, thus restricting EBV infection until the adaptive immunity establishes viral immune control [9]. IFN-\u03b3 secreted by DC-activated NK cells is associated with delayed latent EBV antigen expression. It inhibits B-cell transformation, decreasing their proliferation during the first week following infection [4, 10]. IFN-\u03b3 also promotes an EBV-specific adaptive immune response by favoring a Th1-polarization.",

Exosomes play a role during the early phases of EBV infection and also involve innate immunity-related cell types that are not targeted by the virus [4]. An increase in neutrophils is observed during the initial phases of EBV infection, whereas a transient episode of acute neutropenia is often observed in infectious mononucleosis (IM) during the third week of illness [13]. Infected neutrophils rapidly die by apoptosis [14]. Secretion of various cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-8, MIP-1\u03b1, LTB4, and reactive superoxide anion) promotes the development of EBV-specific immunity, while upregulation of IL-1R and induction of apoptosis in neutrophils inhibit anti-EBV immune responses [12].",

Patients with EBV-associated malignancy show a deficiency in monocyte-mediated ADCC, suggesting that monocyte functions are affected during the course of EBV infection. This is also demonstrated by the reduced phagocytic activity observed in EBV-infected monocytes [3]. EBV infection inhibits the functional ability of macrophages to respond to bacterial challenge by reducing their phagocytic potential [15]. By inhibiting the differentiation of monocytes into mature DCs, EBV temporarily halts the onset of immune responses during primary infection, enabling efficient viral replication. This permits the accumulation of a large pool of virus-infected B lymphocytes, allowing access of the virus to the memory B-cell compartment, interfering with the functions of DCs during the initiation of virus-specific immunity, and modifying the profile of secreted cytokines, thus creating a favorable environment for viral propagation [3, 4].",

EBV has developed the ability to rapidly promote the expression of its own genes while simultaneously shutting down the transcriptional program of its host cell [4].

Primary infection leads to transient viremia followed by a strong T-cell adaptive immune response that holds the infection latent in immunocompetent individuals [22, 24]. If infection is delayed to adolescence or adulthood, it can cause infectious mononucleosis (IM), a self-resolving lymphoid disorder largely resulting from an uncontrolled T-cell reaction directed against EBV-infected cells. In IM patients, EBV is exclusively found in B blasts that proliferate under the influence of latent genes [4]. Following resolution of the primary infection, EBV establishes a lifelong persistence in memory B cells in which the virus remains clinically silent. In this B-cell reservoir, viral expression is entirely repressed, a process described as \u201ctrue latency.\u201d Short episodes of spontaneous reactivation and consequent viral replication normally occur in healthy individuals [24]. Manifestations of liver involvement in immunocompetent hosts range from mild self-limiting acute hepatitis to occasional reports of fatal acute fulminant hepatitis. Abnormal liver blood tests are common in EBV infection and occur in up to 90 % of patients, but symptomatic hepatitis is rare [23]. Jaundice is present in only 5\u201310 % of cases. Typically, the rise in aminotransferases is gradual, reaching a peak that is lower than that encountered in acute viral hepatitis [1].

While 88 % had clinical or biochemical jaundice, 100 % had lymphocytosis, and 88 % had splenomegaly, only 12 % had the classic symptoms of IM. Symptoms lasted for a median of 8 weeks, and only 3/17 patients required a brief hospitalization. Severe cholestatic jaundice and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, which could be mistaken for bile duct obstruction, may occur in elderly patients [25]. In this setting, indirect hyperbilirubinemia resulting from EBV-associated autoimmune hemolytic anemia is more commonly the cause of jaundice than viral-induced cholestasis. Other occasional clinical settings for EBV liver involvement include posttransfusion hepatitis, granulomatous hepatitis, and fatal fulminant hepatitis [1, 26]. EBV superinfection may occur in patients with preexisting autoimmune hepatitis, resulting in severe hepatic decompensation [27]. Cases of liver failure were described both in immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts [26, 28, 29].",

            "text": "Chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV) may result from a disturbance in the host\u2013virus balance and Th1/Th2 misbalance, and may be associated with an aggressive clinical course. CAEBV is defined by chronic severe illness, which begins as a primary EBV infection associated with elevated transaminases, abnormal EBV serology, suggestive histopathological features, and detection of viral genome in the liver tissue. Evidence of recurrent EBV reactivations, increased circulating EBV-specific CTLs, and increased CD38 B-cell expression, along with increased LDH levels, mild splenomegaly, and thrombocytopenia, can support the diagnosis [2, 31]. CAEBV may also progress to a chronic or recurrent IM-like disease [35]. In Western countries, CAEBV is milder than in Asian countries [2]. The mild form is characterized by intact immune control of B cells, relatively low viremia, and EBV-specific CTL expansion comparable to those of seropositive donors. Patients with iatrogenic, congenital, or acquired immunodeficiency are at increased risk for EBV-associated lymphomas and CAEBV. Immune senescence in the elderly is also associated with both reactive and neoplastic EBV-driven lymphoproliferative disorders. EBV may also trigger autoimmune hepatitis [36], chronic granulomatous hepatitis [37], and vanishing bile duct syndrome [38]. While the existence of acute mononuclear hepatitis during primary EBV infection is accepted, skepticism has been expressed as to the hypothesis that EBV causes chronic liver disease in immune-competent patients. EBV in this setting may be referred to as an \u201cincidental virus,\u201d reflecting a co-infection with other hepatotropic viruses that are a more likely cause of chronic liver disease or amplification of the EBV genome in circulating B cells that turn up in the liver [2].",

In a cohort of patients with chronic hepatitis B and C, patients with reactivated EBV infection had lower levels of HBV DNA and higher mean values of serum hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, respectively, compared to EBV patients without reactivation [2]. EBV reactivations may precede HBV flares. Reactivation of EBV-specific T cells promotes production of several cytokines such as interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, and IL-10. EBV BCRF1 shares high sequence homology with IL-10, and exogenous IL-10 enhances HCV replication. EBNA1 can promote HCV replication. IFN-\u03b3 inhibits HBV replication in the absence of cell necrosis. T-cell cross-activation may also explain HBV or HCV reactivation [2].",

EBV or infected cell clones can promote the replication of HCV and have been suggested to be involved in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). EBV-infected cells support HCV replication better than uninfected cells, suggesting that EBV may act as a helper virus to promote HCV replication in HCV-positive HCCs. A greater amount of EBV DNA was reported in HCV-positive HCC compared to HBV-associated HCC. In some studies, up to 30 % of liver cancers were found to harbor EBV DNA [42]. This finding, however, was not confirmed in other studies. A possible source of detected EBV DNA might be the infiltrating lymphocytes [2]. The weak positivity of EBV DNA in some liver tissues was explained by others as possible amplification of EBV DNA in the lymphoid infiltrate or blood, reflecting a high EBV DNA load in these patients.",

            "text": "Primary EBV infection is subclinical in the majority of immunocompetent individuals; it may lead to IM in adolescents and adults. It is generally self-limiting; therefore, in immunocompetent individuals, symptomatic treatment alone is recommended. This includes rest, adequate hydration and nutrition, and analgesics or antipyretics as needed. In patients suffering from IM, avoidance of exertion and participation in sports is recommended for at least 3 weeks due to the rare risk of splenic rupture. Rare patients suffering from severe complications of acute EBV are usually treated with corticosteroids even though there is little evidence to support their use [43, 44]. The dose used varies in different reports. The use of antivirals in the management of severe EBV infections in immunocompetent hosts is debatable. However, it is suggested as an adjunct to steroid treatment [45], especially in cases of refractory disease [46]. Several antiviral drugs, including acyclic nucleoside and nucleotide analogues and pyrophosphate analogues, inhibit replication of EBV in cell culture via inhibition of EBV DNA polymerase. Acyclovir inhibits in vitro EBV replication and transiently reduces viral shedding in the oropharynx but does not reduce viremia or symptoms. Ganciclovir was effective in the treatment of EBV hepatitis in a small number of children and in adults [47]. Valganciclovir, the oral pro-drug of ganciclovir, has been successfully used in the treatment of severe acute EBV hepatitis (900 mg \u00d7 2/daily for 15 days) [46]. Additional drugs with antiviral activity against EBV include valacyclovir, famciclovir, and foscarnet. Patients with acute liver failure should be considered for urgent liver transplantation, as the likelihood of spontaneous recovery is small [48]. Patients with immunodeficiencies are at increased risk of liver failure and the development of lethal lymphoproliferative diseases. The major pathogenic causes thought to be important in the development of lymphoproliferative disorders/lymphomas are primary immunodeficiency (XLP, ataxia telangiectasia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, SCID, CVID, and others), immunosuppressive therapy, and HIV/AIDS. In these patients, primary EBV infection should be treated preemptively with ex vivo-generated EBV-specific CTLs or effective antiviral medication. In seronegative patients with XLP, monthly prophylaxis with IVIG is recommended. Patients who have developed EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease may benefit from chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or biological therapy with monoclonal antibodies or EBV-specific CTLs. Hematopoetic stem cell transplantation is the only potentially curative therapy for many patients but is usually recommended only in children [49].",

Valganciclovir has recently been evaluated among liver transplant recipients with CMV disease [1, 56]. Ganciclovir can lead to myelosuppression, central nervous system disorders, hepatotoxicity, irreversible infertility, or teratogenesis, whereas foscarnet can cause disturbances in mineral and electrolyte homeostasis and nephrotoxicity.

Prophylactic versus preemptive therapy for intermediate- and low-risk groups (D+/R+, D\u2212/R+, and D\u2212/R\u2212, respectively) is based on the local expertise of each transplant center. However, the general approach for D\u2212/R\u2212 patients is that only seronegative blood products are used and no prophylaxis is administered. D+/R+ or D\u2212/R+ patients are monitored for CMV reactivation and treated preemptively for 7 days. Where available, \u201cprotective matching\u201d of donor and recipient based on CMV serological status is advocated because it has been shown to reduce the risk of post-transplant CMV disease [69]. The current recommendation for antiviral treatment of CMV disease after liver transplantation is intravenous ganciclovir along with a reduction in the degree of pharmacologic immunosuppression [78]. Valganciclovir is a possible oral treatment for mild to moderate disease [78]. In cases of ganciclovir-resistant CMV disease, treatment options include foscarnet, cidofovir, CMV hyperimmune globulins, or leflunomide [69]. Compartmentalized CMV disease refers to clinical syndromes wherein the virus is detected in the affected tissues but is minimally detectable or undetectable in the blood [56, 69]. In the gastrointestinal system, \u201ccompartmentalized\u201d CMV disease in the form of gastritis, esophagitis, enteritis, or colitis constitutes the vast majority of tissue-invasive conditions [60].",

Fatal cases of adenovirus infection with fulminant hepatitis were reported in immunosuppressed adults [90]. No specific therapy for adenovirus hepatitis is currently available, and cidofovir has been recently suggested as an optional treatment [1].",
