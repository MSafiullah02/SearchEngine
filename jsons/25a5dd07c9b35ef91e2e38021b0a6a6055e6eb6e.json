However, drug therapy development is a costly and timely process with a high attrition rate [6] . The speed of the normal drug development pathway is unacceptable in the context of the current global emergency.

Both drugs function as protease inhibitors and are used extensively in the management of HIV-1 [9] . However, lopinavir has insufficient oral bioavailability for significant therapeutic activity, due to rapid catabolism by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system (specifically 3A4 isoenzyme) [9] . Thus, ritonavir is given concomitantly to inhibit this, significantly boosting the half-life of lopinavir. Lopinavir/ritonavir was investigated for efficacy against SARS-CoV in 2004 and found to be effective compared with a historical control [10] .
