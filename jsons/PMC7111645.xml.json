Over the last 100 years, significant research efforts have focused on predicting the expected spreading behavior of contact-based infectious diseases, exploiting characteristics of the population and the disease itself. However, there have been limited research efforts focusing on the use of future social network data: while current social network models are abstract constructs where people are anonymously represented as nodes, it is not unreasonable to expect developments in data collection (through Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, etc.) which will allow accurate mappings between known individuals.",

Furthermore, the ongoing development of activity-based travel models, which examine why, where and when various activities are engaged in by individuals (Lam and Huang 2003; Roorda et al. 2009; Ramadurai and Ukkusuri 2010), as well as innovations in pedestrian modeling (Hoogendoorn and Bovy 2005) present additional promising alternatives to generate social contact networks in the future. As such, it is critical to develop methods which can exploit this data in aiding the prevention and mitigation of contagion episodes.",

This work specifically considers contact-based diseases, which refer to the family of infectious diseases that are transmitted from an infected to susceptible individual via direct contact. This category includes sexually transmitted diseases, various strands of the flu, SARS and the common cold, among others. In turn the social contact network is representative of the social interactions (e.g. through school, work or home) which occur among a group of individuals in a given time period (e.g. a day).",

We further assume that no information is known about the infection tree (i.e., the set of social contacts through which the disease spread). We refer to this set of assumptions as the partial information version of the problem, in contrast to the full information case in which time-of-infection information is available for all infected nodes. In previous work by Gardner et al. (2012), an application of the full information problem was addressed, where the objective was to infer the most likely air travel routes responsible for spreading the Swine Flu to unexposed geographic regions. In Gardner\u2019s paper social contact networks were not considered, and the network structure was defined by the air traffic system.",

The partial information problem can be modeled as an integer program, and represents a considerably more difficult problem to solve than the full information case. Heuristic solution methods are therefore developed based on sub-problems which can be solved much more efficiently. The model performance is based on how accurately it predicts the paths of infection for a given contagion episode (which are extracted from simulation outputs). The outcome of the model can provide insight into future epidemic outbreak behavior and aid in the evaluation and recommendation of intervention strategies. In addition, the proposed solution methodology can be extended to alternative contagion processes which occur atop known network structures (e.g. tracking food borne outbreaks which propagate though a distribution network).",

            "text": "The infection rate and pattern of the disease spreading process through a network is dependent on both the parameters of the disease (infectious period, level of contagiousness, etc.) and the fundamental structure of the network. In efforts to predict expected disease spreading behavior and characteristics, epidemiological models span from extremely generalized and simplified analytical models to increasingly in-depth stochastic agent based simulation tools. Analytical models are used to quantify the statistical properties of epidemic patterns (Colizza et al. 2006; Balcan et al. 2009); however, they are unable to capture certain behavioral aspects of the dynamics of disease spreading, and often lack detailed information about the network structure. In contrast, agent based simulation models can be used to replicate possible spreading scenarios, predict average spreading behavior, and analyze various intervention strategies for a given network and disease while capturing a greater degree of detail, but in turn require a highly detailed set of input data (see Rvachev and Longini (1985), Epstein and Cummings (2002), Eubank et al. (2004), Hufnagel et al. (2004), Dibble and Feldman (2004), Cahill et al. (2005), Dunham (2005), Meyers et al. (2005), Small and Tse (2005), Carley et al. (2006), Ferguson et al. (2006), Germann et al. (2006), Ekici et al. (2008), Roche et al. (2011), and Haydon et al. (2003)). The most recent and comprehensive models provide a greater degree of realism, but are difficult to implement within the short time frames in which real time control decisions must be made. Large scale simulation models can also be computationally taxing because multiple runs are required to accurately predict expected outcomes.",

            "text": "There currently exists a gap in the literature which calls for scenario specific disease prediction models. Most contagion models predict future potential outbreak scenarios based on system-wide information; however, they are not able to reconstruct the contagion process of an ongoing outbreak to reveal information about the current state of the network. Recent advances in disease modeling have begun addressing this issue. For example, there are models which use genetic sequencing data to analytically infer the geographic history of a given virus\u2019s migration (Drummond and Rambaut 2007; Lemey et al. 2009; Wallace et al. 2007; Cottam et al. 2008; Haydon et al.; 2003). Often this approach involves first enumerating all possible evolutionary trees, then assigning posterior probabilities based on specifics of the respective virus\u2019 mutation rates. Additionally the infection trees only include locations where samples were available. Jombart et al. (2009) proposed a novel approach to reconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics of outbreaks from sequence data by inferring ancestries directly between strains of an outbreak using their genotype and collection date. The \u201cinfectious\u201d links were selected such that the number of mutations between nodes is minimized. The idea of using infection data to construct the most likely path of transmission is the highlighted goal of this paper.",

Constraint (10) ensures that that the infection time of j will be within the time period when i is infectious, i.e., within \u03bb time units of the infection time of i. Constraint (11) fixes the timestamp variable t\ni for all information-nodes. Constraints (12)-(14) enforce the spanning tree structure of the solution. Constraint (12) ensures that every known infected node, except the source node, is infected exactly once, i.e., has exactly one incoming link. Constraint (13) allows zero-information nodes to be part of the infection tree, but restricts them to have at most one predecessor. Constraint (14) ensures that only zero information nodes that have been previously infected will be able to in turn infect other nodes.

As such, the cycle finding subroutine of the algorithm is the most computationally taxing part of the algorithm.

It is trivial to show that in all feasible solutions, x\nkl \n= 0 for all links (k,l) in A\\L. Therefore, we can limit our focus to the link set L. Because of constraint (19), which requires feasible links in L to connect nodes with increasing timestamps, the resulting sub-network has a topological ordering, and as such, cannot contain any directed cycles. We further note that constraints (23) and (25) represent the requirement that exactly one incoming link is chosen for every infected node. As such, any solution that only chooses links in L so that every node has exactly one incoming link will be feasible. The following algorithm can be implemented to solve the full information case, and the resulting set of selected links S forms the maximum likelihood tree.i.Define the set of feasible links, L = {(i,j): t\ni \n< t\nj \n< (t\ni \n+ \u03bb)}ii.Calculate link costs, P\nij for links (i,j) in feasible set L\niii.For each infected node, j \u2208 I, select the incoming link (i,j) with the highest cost, P\nij, from the set of feasible links L and add it to the solution tree S\n.\n\n",

Because the link costs are no longer constant, rather a function of the timestamps, the proposed full information algorithm can no longer be used to find an optimal solution.

Removing link (k,j) only affects the constraint requiring node j to be infected once, which is satisfied by including link (i,j). The infection timing requirements given by constraints (19) and (20) are satisfied based on the conditions provided in the lemma.

We can exploit Lemma 2 to more easily construct a feasible solution by adding any links that satisfy the conditions of the lemma a priori. This procedure is defined in Algorithm 1. The objective of the algorithm is to identify a set of link variables, x\nji, to fix a priori based on their contribution to the objective function (27). To do this the variable bestPredecessorValue (initialized to \u2212 \u221e) is created to identify the incoming link for each node which maximizes the contribution to the objective function (27), such that both nodes belong to I. The bestPredecessorValue variable is updated by evaluating each incoming link (j,i) for node i such that i,j\n\u2208\nI. The best incoming link will be added to the solution, and its corresponding x\nji variable fixed to 1. Fixing variables a priori will decrease the number of decision variables in A_ILP. Additionally, the way in which they are fixed guarantees a feasible solution can be obtained. The outline of the algorithm is outlined below.\n",

We solve A_ILP using a branch and cut procedure which is implemented using a commercial IP solver. More precisely, after fixing a sub-set of the links to be included in the tree (based on the output from Algorithm 1), we solve A_ILP to optimality. While solving A_ILP we store a subset of the feasible solutions found, which will be used as starting solutions in the subsequent steps of the heuristic.

The full set of performance measures used to evaluate the model performance are listed below:i.Expected percentage of correctly infected links: The percentage of infected links which are correctly identified as infected by the model on average.ii.Expected percentage of correctly labeled links: The percentage of all links in the network which are correctly identified, as either infected or non-infected by the model on average.iii.Expected percentage of correctly infected nodes: The percentage of infected nodes which are correctly identified as infected by the model on average.iv.Expected percentage of correctly labeled nodes: The percentage of all nodes in the network which are correctly identified, as either infected or non-infected by the model on average.\n",

Various studies have found that power law networks are representative of many real world networks, including social contact networks (Barab\u00e1si and Albert 1999; Gonzalez et al. 2008). Power law networks have a hub and spoke type structure with few highly connected nodes, (known as super spreaders in the context of contagion problems), while most nodes have a very low degree. Due to the extremely heterogeneous structure of power law networks contagion processes behave differently compared with more homogenous network structures such as Poisson and uniform networks. In addition a power law network structure is much more subjective to the transmission properties of the disease; a low transmission probability translates to a low probability of infecting a super spreader node, therefore an outbreak is less likely to spread to a large proportion of the population. As the transmission probability increases the probability of infecting a super spreader increases, significantly increasing the likelihood of infecting a large portion of the population. This behavior is illustrated by comparing Figs. 4 and 6 which display the outbreak size (as the percentage of nodes infected) for 1,000 independent simulations of an outbreak on power law and Poisson network structures, respectively. For the Poisson network many more of the simulations resulted in a higher number of infections than in the power law network.",

The overall node-level performance of the heuristic exceeds the link-level performance because it is possible for the heuristic to correctly predict the set of infected nodes without correctly predicting every infected link. Each network and contagion scenario will result in a set of infected nodes which may exhibit many feasible (link-level) infection patterns. As such, it is possible for the heuristic to correctly predict a higher percentage of infected nodes than infected links. The difference in node level and link level performance suggest that A_ILP does a poor job at identifying the set of infected nodes, but a better job at identifying the set of infected links; additionally, the heuristic is able to significantly improve upon the set of infected nodes identified by A_ILP, but is unable to significantly improve upon the set of links identified in the same solution. The node level performance gap between A_ILP and heuristic is due to the accuracy of the node addition step of the heuristic, until which the set of nodes is constrained to those included in the initial feasible tree. The set of nodes added in this step can represent a substantial percentage of the total infected nodes, often improving upon the A_ILP solution by 60 %. However the set of links selected to branch to the newly added nodes are not as accurately identified. This behavior is observed across network structures.",

The largest weakness with the proposed methodology is the lack of verifiability due to limited data availability. Without accurate social contact networks and link-level infection data to validate the model\u2019s performance, it is not possible to evaluate certain model characteristics. As such, one major motivation for this work is to incentivize better data collection efforts. For the proposed model, collecting contact-level infection data would be the most valuable. Contact level information requires data from infected individuals on their recent social interactions. Such link-level infection data is difficult to collect, but would permit quantitative analysis of the models\u2019 performance. Additionally research in the development of social networks which more accurately depict the set of social contacts in a region will be integral in the implementability of this research. One such approach is to exploit regional travel patterns to define a social network. By using regional travel patterns (such as origin\u2013destination tables and activity-based travel patterns), individuals\u2019 daily trips, specific types of interaction, and length of interaction can be accounted for. With an accurate depiction of individuals daily contact patterns, the proposed model can be implemented to provide information on the set of contacts most likely responsible for spreading infection during an outbreak, aiding in the development of regional mitigation strategies.",
