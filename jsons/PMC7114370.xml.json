            "text": "Yellow head virus (YHV) is a highly virulent pathogen of the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon). It can cause rapidly accumulating mortalities in aquaculture ponds, resulting in total crop loss within several days of the first signs of disease. Yellow head disease first emerged in central Thailand in 1990 (Limsuwan, 1991). It has since been reported in most major shrimp producing countries in Asia and remains a disease of serious concern globally (Walker et al., 2001, OIE, 2007). YHV is now known to be one of several closely related genotypes. These include gill-associated virus (GAV), a less virulent virus that was first detected in Australia in association with a condition named mid-crop mortality syndrome, and at least four other genotypes identified only in healthy P. monodon shrimp from Southeast Asia, India and East Africa (Walker et al., 2001, Wijegoonawardane et al., 2004, Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008).",

            "text": "YHV is a positive-sense (+) ssRNA virus that is currently classified with GAV as a member of the species Gill-associated virus, genus Okavirus, family Roniviridae in the order Nidovirales (Walker et al., 2005). The enveloped virions are rod-shaped (approximately 70 nm \u00d7 180 nm) with prominent surface projections and an internal helical nucleocapsid (Wongteerasupaya et al., 1995, Nadala et al., 1997). Virions contain three structural proteins comprising two transmembrane glycoproteins (gp116 and gp64) and a nucleoprotein (p20) (Jitrapakdee et al., 2003, Sittidilokratna et al., 2006). For GAV, the 26,235 nt genome has been shown to be 3\u2032-polyadenylated, and contain five open reading frames (ORFs) bounded by 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTRs. ORF1a and ORF1b are expressed from genome-length mRNA and overlap (Cowley et al., 2000, Cowley et al., 2002). ORF1a encodes a long polyprotein (pp1a) that includes a 3C-like protease domain. ORF1b is translated only following a \u22121 ribosomal frame-shift at a predicted pseudoknot structure in the ORF overlap region and encodes enzymes of the replication complex (Cowley et al., 2000, Ziebuhr et al., 2003). GAV ORF2 and ORF3 are expressed from sub-genomic (sg)mRNAs and encode the nucleoprotein and the virion envelope glycoprotein, respectively (Cowley and Walker, 2002, Cowley et al., 2004). Downstream of ORF3 is a 638 nt region which includes a 249-nt open reading frame (ORF4) that has been reported to be expressed at low level in GAV-infected cells (Dhar et al., 2004).",

The GAV ORF1a sequence (GenBank accession number AF227196) was initially used to design 10 sets of PCR primers to amplify overlapping regions covering the entire ORF1a gene. Four of the primer sets amplified DNA products which were gel purified and sequenced. Sequences obtained from these products and the 5\u2032-terminal genome region amplified by 5\u2032-RACE (see below) were then used to design four sets of YHV-specific primers (Table 1\n) to amplify products spanning the remaining regions of ORF1a. The Superscript One-Step RT-PCR kit (Life Technologies) was used according to the manufacturer's recommended procedure with minor modifications. Reactions (25 \u03bcl) contained the kit reagents plus 0.5 \u03bcg YHV RNA, 0.4 \u03bcM primers and 8 U RNasin (Promega). To amplify DNA products larger than 3 kb, additional (1 \u03bcl) Elongase Enzyme mix (Invitrogen) was added to the reaction. RT-PCR was performed in a PerkinElmer 2400 thermal cycler using the conditions 50 \u00b0C/30 min and 94 \u00b0C/2 min for reverse transcription and enzyme inactivation followed by 35 cycles of 94 \u00b0C/20 s, 55 \u00b0C/30 s and 68 \u00b0C/210 s, and a final extension of 72 \u00b0C/10 min. DNA products obtained were gel purified and sequenced directly using each of the PCR primers. Additional primers designed to sequences obtained were used to extend the sequences in both directions and confirm that obtained in other direction.",

Assuming a ribosomal frame-shift occurs at the conserved slippage site identified in GAV within the ORF1a/ORF1b sequence overlap (Cowley et al., 2000, Sittidilokratna et al., 2002), translation through YHV ORF1b would result in an extended polyprotein (pp1ab) of 6688 amino acids with a molecular mass of 762,017.85 Da. There is a high level of overall amino acid sequence identity between YHV and GAV pp1a (82.4% identity) and pp1ab (84.9% identity), with sequence variations distributed relatively evenly throughout each polyprotein. YHV pp1a is 15 amino acids longer than GAV pp1a due to insertions of stretches of up to 3 amino acids that occur primarily in the N-terminal third of the protein and a C-terminal deletion of 3 amino acids beyond the ribosomal frame-shift site. YHV pp1ab is also 15 amino acids longer than GAV pp1ab due to an insertion of an additional stretch of 3 amino acids (Sittidilokratna et al., 2002).",

Autolytic cleavage of the polyproteins occurs via a 3C-like \u2018main\u2019 protease (named after the picornavirus 3C proteases) located within the C-terminal third of pp1a, and one or more paralogous papain-like \u2018accessory\u2019 proteases located within the N-terminal half of pp1a. Analysis of the YHV pp1a sequence identified a 3C-like protease domain between I2866 and G3006. This domain shares a high level of amino acid sequence identity (87.9%) with the corresponding domain described previously for GAV (Cowley et al., 2000), including a core of key residues that are conserved across coronaviruses and arteriviruses (Fig. 4A). As reported previously for GAV, the YHV 3C-like protease employs the H/C catalytic dyad that is characteristic of coronaviruses, rather than the H/S dyad of the arteriviruses and toroviruses (Fig. 4A). Two proteolytic cleavage sites identified previously in GAV pp1a and pp1ab are highly conserved in the YHV sequence. These are located at 2838LVTHE\u2193VNTGN2847 and 6455KVNHE\u2193LYHVA6464 in pp1ab and conform to the proposed substrate consensus sequence, VxHE\u2193(L,V) (Ziebuhr et al., 2003).",

However, they share similarities with papain-like cysteine proteases of other positive-sense RNA viruses that include variations of a characteristic \u03b1 + \u03b2 fold and a C/H catalytic dyad in which the Cys residue is usually followed immediately by a large aromatic residue (Tyr or Trp). In coronaviruses and arteriviruses, the accessory proteases also feature, within the framework of the papain-like fold, a Zn2+-binding finger that is essential for proteolytic activity and appears also to function as a transcription factor in sgmRNA synthesis (Herold et al., 1999, Tijms et al., 2001, Ziebuhr, 2005). Scanning of the YHV pp1a sequence identified four regions in which a CY/W motif is followed by H at a suitable distance (70\u2013180 amino acids) downstream. However, only one of the four possible sites (C2102/H2281) is predicted to adopt a secondary structure that features a \u03b1-helix domain downstream of the catalytic Cys residue, followed by a \u03b2-sheet domain that incorporates the catalytic His residue (Fig. 5A). The sequence of this domain (designated YHV PLP1) is only moderately conserved in GAV pp1a (73.7% identity). However, the C/H catalytic dyad is preserved and a similar \u03b1 + \u03b2 fold is predicted. The domain is similar in length to the PLP1 and PLP2 domains of coronavirus pp1a polyproteins but, as illustrated in Fig. 5A for the PLP2 domain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), amino acid sequence similarity with papain-like proteases is weak and, significantly, like those of toroviruses, the domain lacks a Zn2+-binding finger. Approximately 120 amino acids downstream of YHV PLP1, and immediately upstream of hydrophobic domain (HD3) flanking the 3CL protease, there is a second region (C2461/H2607) that features the (CY\u2026H) motif and shares striking amino acid sequence homology (50.8% similarity; 17.8% identity) with the PLP1 domain (Fig. 5B). However, in both YHV and GAV, this region (designated PLPX) lacks both the Zn2+-binding finger and the canonical \u03b1 + \u03b2 fold.",

YHV and GAV share a high level of amino acid sequence identity in these domains and feature amino acids residues that have been reported to be conserved in other nidovirus pp1ab polyproteins.

Features shared with coronaviruses, toroviruses, arteriviruses and bafniviruses (Spaan et al., 2005, Schultze et al., 2006) include a polyadenylated (+) ssRNA genome, overlapping reading frames encoding elements of the viral replicase, a \u22121 ribosomal frame-shift site followed by a predicted RNA pseudoknot structure in the overlap region, a characteristic \u2018SDD\u2019 sequence motif at the polymerase active site, and the expression of the replicase and virion structural proteins from a nested set of 3\u2032-coterminal genomic and sub-genomic mRNAs. We also show that the replicase functional domains in YHV are arranged similarly to those of other nidoviruses and include putative papain-like protease (PLP) and 3C-like protease (3CLP) domains in pp1a, and putative helicase, exonuclease (ExoN), uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (XendoU) and ribose-O-methyl transferase (2\u2032-O-MT) domains in the downstream region of pp1ab. Other domains not identified in YHV include the ADRP that occurs coronaviruses, toroviruses and bafniviruses (Snijder et al., 2003, Draker et al., 2006, Putics et al., 2006, Gorbelenya et al., 2006, Schultze et al., 2006) and the cyclic phosphodiesterase that has been identified in pp1a of toroviruses and in the ORF2 product of some coronaviruses (Snijder et al., 1991). It is not yet clear whether these domains are totally absent from YHV pp1a or have diverged beyond the limits of recognizable sequence homology.",

            "text": "Nidovirus proteases encoded in pp1a and pp1ab include a \u2018main\u2019 3C-like protease that processes the key downstream replicase domains, including the RdRp and helicase enzymes, and one or more papain-like \u2018accessory\u2019 proteases that recognize sites in the N-terminal half of the replicase polyproteins (Ziebuhr et al., 2000). YHV pp1a appears to contain a single PLP domain (PLP1) which was identified on the basis of the conserved C/H catalytic dyad and structural similarity to the characteristic \u03b1 + \u03b2 fold of other papain-like proteases (Herold et al., 1999). The catalytic dyad and fold structure are each preserved in the corresponding region of GAV pp1a in which there is relatively high amino acid sequence identity with YHV (74.7%, data not shown). Coronaviruses, arteriviruses and toroviruses may encode up to three papain-like cysteine proteases and it has been suggested that, during the course of nidovirus evolution, these domains may have been duplicated (Ziebuhr et al., 2000). The arteriviruses papain-like protease domains are located near the N-terminus of pp1a (den Boon et al., 1995). In coronaviruses, PLP domains are located in the central region of pp1a and are almost twice as long. Each adopts the canonical \u03b1 + \u03b2 fold and the C/H catalytic dyad is separated by a relatively short sequence similar to other viral papain-like proteases (Herold et al., 1999, Ziebuhr et al., 2000). Coronavirus and arterivirus PLPs commonly include a Zn2+-binding finger that connects the \u03b1 and \u03b2 domains of the papain-like fold and appears to have a role in regulating transcription (Herold et al., 1999, Tijms et al., 2001). In group 1 coronaviruses (e.g., HCoV-229E) and group 2a coronaviruses (e.g., MHV), there are two PLP domains (Ziebuhr et al., 2000). In group 3 coronaviruses (e.g., IBV) two domains are evident but the first (PLP1) is not active, and in SARS coronavirus, only a single PLP domain (PLP2) is present (Snijder et al., 2003). Toroviruses (e.g., EToV) also encode only a single short PLP domain that, although cysteine-rich, appears to lack a typical Zn2+-binding finger (Draker et al., 2006). In YHV and GAV, the size and location of the single PLP domain (PLP1) in pp1a is similar to coronaviruses but, like toroviruses, it lacks the central Zn2+-binding finger. A second downstream domain (PLPX) also features the (CY\u2026H) motif but lacks both the canonical \u03b1 + \u03b2 fold and the Zn2+-binding finger (Fig. 5B) and is therefore unlikely to be functional as a papain-like protease. Nevertheless, the region is similar in size and sequence to the PLP1 domain and may have arisen by duplication of an ancestral PLP.",

In coronaviruses and toroviruses, the ExoN domain displays homology to conserved catalytic residues of DEDD superfamily RNase homologues in yeast and bacteria but varies by the insertion of a single Zn2+-binding finger between conserved sequence blocks I and II (Snijder et al., 2003). In YHV (and GAV), this Zn2+-binding structure is preserved and a second Zn-finger lies between conserved blocks II and III. The DEDD superfamily of exoribonucleases is a subset of a much larger superfamily that includes the proofreading domains of many DNA polymerases as well as other DNA exonucleases (Bernad et al., 1989, Moser et al., 1997, Zuo and Deutscher, 2001). It has been suggested that nidovirus ExoN may also be involved in proofreading, allowing these large RNA genomes to avoid error catastrophe during replication (Snijder et al., 2003). Domains including dual Zn-finger motifs have been identified as essential to the exonuclease activity of some eukaryote and archaea DNA polymerases that appear to be involved in recognition and repair of DNA damage (Dua et al., 1998, Shen et al., 2003).",

            "text": "YHV and GAV are each currently classified as the same virus species (Gill-associated virus) in the genus Okavirus, family Roniviridae, order Nidovirales (Walker et al., 2005). However, a consideration of the relative virulence, geographic distribution and host range, and the genome sequence data reported here, raises issues with respect to the possible taxonomic assignment of YHV as a separate virus species. YHV is one of the most significant pathogens of farmed shrimp, causing a disease that develops rapidly and often results in total crop loss within several days (Flegel et al., 1995). These characteristics distinguish YHV from GAV which, although associated mortalities in P. monodon in Australia, occurs commonly in healthy shrimp in Australasia and Asia and is far less virulent (\u223c106-fold by LD50) in experimental bioassays (Sittidilokratna and Walker, unpublished data). YHV and GAV share a similar genome organization (5\u2032-ORF1a-ORF1b-ORF2-ORF3-(ORF4)-polyA-3\u2032) and common strategies for gene expression that employ a nested set of genomic and sub-genomic mRNAs, a ribosomal frame-shift in the ORF1a/ORF1b overlap and proteolytic processing of polyproteins generated from both the ORF1a/ORF1b replicase and ORF3 glycoprotein genes. The level of nucleotide sequence identity between the genomes is \u223c79% overall and varies in the range \u223c74% in ORF3 to \u223c82% in ORF1b. Amino acid sequence identity varies from approximately 73% in gp116 to 84% in pp1ab. Excluding the polyA tail, the YHV genome (26,662 nt) is somewhat larger than the GAV genome (26,235 nt), due to sequence insertions that occur primarily in several large blocks. Two of these are located in untranslated regions between ORF1b and ORF2 (259 nt insertion) and immediately following ORF3 (41 nt insertion). There are also multiple blocks of inserted sequence within ORF3 (76 nt total insertion) in the region encoding the hypervariable N-terminal domain of YHV gp116 and these significantly increase its calculated molecular mass (101.5 kDa prior to glycosylation), compared to GAV gp116 (98.1 kDa). Other deletions are distributed throughout the coding regions but occur primarily in ORF1a as single or triple codon deletions that maintain the reading frame. Relative to YHV, there are very few sequence insertions in the GAV genome, suggesting it may be more stable, perhaps reflecting a stable longer term association with its natural host (P. monodon) in which low-level benign infections commonly occur at high prevalence (Walker et al., 2001).",

            "text": "The 3\u2032-terminal region between ORF3 and the polyA tail also displays several significant distinguishing features. In GAV, this 638 nt region contains an open reading frame (ORF4) encoding a 83 aa (9.6 kDa) protein that has been reported to be expressed at low levels in GAV-infected shrimp tissues (Dhar et al., 2004). In YHV, the corresponding 677 nt 3\u2032-terminal region contains a severely truncated open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of only 20 aa. Although this product shares perfect amino acid sequence identity with the N-terminus of the GAV ORF4 protein, it is unlikely to be expressed as a functional protein. This is consistent with the observation reported for GAV (Cowley et al., 2002) that no discrete transcript is generated from the corrupted TRS immediately upstream of ORF4, suggesting that expression occurs either by internal initiation from sgmRNA2 or from variable-length RNAs transcribed in low abundance from multiple sites in the upstream UTR (Cowley et al. unpublished data). However, the existence of a TRS-like sequence upstream of this region in both YHV and GAV, and the high level of sequence homology within ORF4 and downstream of the point of truncation, indicate that this 3\u2032-region of the ronivirus genome is a genetic resource in active evolutionary transition.",

            "text": "Virus species demarcation is a complex task that is based on the concept, endorsed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), of a species as \u2018a polythetic class of viruses that constitute a replicating lineage and occupy a particular ecological niche\u2019, and requires a holistic consideration of molecular and biological properties (van Regenmortel, 2000). On the basis of nucleic acid or amino acid sequence identity alone, the data presented here indicate that YHV and GAV fulfill species demarcation criteria applied to such diverse RNA viruses as potyviruses (<85% whole genome identity) and geminiviruses (<85\u201390% identical over genome component A) infecting plants, and lyssaviruses (<86% replicase identity) and flaviviruses (<88% whole genome identity) infecting animals. The significant difference in overall genome size (427 nt) due primarily to large insertions/deletions in non-coding regions is also consistent with a view that YHV and GAV represent distinct genetic lineages. Although they share the same natural host (Penaeus monodon shrimp) and a similar susceptible host range, YHV and GAV differ significantly in virulence and pathogenicity, and have natural distributions that are geographically remote (i.e., Asia and Australia, respectively). Nevertheless, YHV and GAV represent only two of several distinct genetic lineages of closely related viruses infecting P. monodon amongst which there is evidence for natural genetic recombination, possibly as a consequence of co-infections resulting from the translocation and co-habitation of infected broodstock and larvae for aquaculture (Walker et al., 2001, Wijegoonawardane et al., 2004, Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008). This common practice is likely to confound any speciation established through past natural geographic isolation. It appears, therefore, that despite molecular and biological evidence to the contrary, the current taxonomic assignment of YHV and GAV as the same species should be maintained until a clearer picture of this complex of viruses emerges.",
