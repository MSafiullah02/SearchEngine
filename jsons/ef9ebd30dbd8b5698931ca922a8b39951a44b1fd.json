However, GI symptoms were also prevalent (53%) in COVID-19 negative patients, and multivariable analysis showed that GI symptoms were not associated with an increased likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19. This has not yet been reported in prior studies which have been limited by retrospective review of symptoms done in hospitalized patients.

Our study of mostly outpatients with mild to moderate symptoms did not show increased hospitalization rate or ICU care needs for COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms.

The median duration of symptoms before COVID-19 testing was not significantly different between COVID-19 positive and negative patients (4 days [IQR, 5]), p=0.549) (Table 1). There was no significant difference in hospitalization and mean days to testing between COVID-19 patients with or without any GI symptoms. COVID-19. Loss of smell (OR 8.29, 95% CI 3.56-19.28; p<0.001) or taste (OR 3.41, 95% CI 1.53-7.61; p<0.003) and fever (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.17-3.92; p=0.014) were the symptoms most likely to be associated with COVID-19. Diarrhea and anorexia alone were not specific for COVID-19 infection on multivariable analyses. However, the specificity for COVID-19",
