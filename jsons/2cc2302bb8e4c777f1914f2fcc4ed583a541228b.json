Initial estimates suggested a mortality rate of 2% and that~18% of the cases show severe symptoms, although such estimates are still subject to rapid changes (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/ 30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-internationalhealth-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-theoutbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)). [1] [2] [3] To facilitate the swift development of a candidate vaccine for 2019-nCoV we compared here the viral and the human proteomes, searching for pentapeptides that are unique to the pathogen. We followed the rationale that non-self sequences are highly immunogenic and uniquely viral epitopes should improve safety and efficacy by minimizing the risk for cross-reactions and increasing anti-viral specificity. 4-6 The analysis was conducted on the entire viral proteome but primarily focused on the surface spike glycoprotein (id = \"QHD43416.1) because immune response against it is highly likely to exert a neutralizing effect. 2 The entire amino acid (aa) sequence of the 2019-nCoV was retrieved from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947 and dissected into pentapeptides overlapped by four residues for a total of n = 9661. Then, each pentamer was analyzed for occurrences in the human proteome using the Peptide Match program (https://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/peptidematch/ index.jsp). 7 It resulted that n = 933 viral pentapeptides are absent in the human proteome, and therefore foreign to the human immune system (Table S1 ). Among these non-self pentapeptides, n = 107 are embedded in the viral surface glycoprotein (spike protein) that mediates binding to the human ACE2 and cellular entry. 2 The recommended oligopeptides for a multi-epitope 2109-nCoV-vaccine are presented in Table 1 , Panel a. They can be rapidly tested in animal models for immunogenicity and safety in order to timely develop a vaccine for preventing uncontrolled spreading of the novel coronavirus.",
