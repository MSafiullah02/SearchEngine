Managerial challenges include the inability of managers to gain insight from data analytics results, and subsequently linking the insight to actual business problems with the objective of increasing revenue [13]. Organisational related challenges include changes in decision making and leadership, organisation culture changes, adoption of a data-driven decision-making culture and clear direction of initiatives [10].",

A matrix was created listing the each of the domains horizontally with a specific measurement identified in literature supporting the domain. For example, articles indicating a clear statement of what the BDA implementation should achieve was included in the investment objective; advantages and benefits achieved as part of a BDA implementation was included under the business benefits section; permanent business changes such as business processes as part of the business changes heading; enabling changes referring to non-permanent, short term changes in the organisation; and IT enablers refers to any technology related requirements for BDA. Table 1 contains an example of the matrix used. The authors of the various articles were listed on each table row.
