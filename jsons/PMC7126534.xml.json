However, its acute and late toxicity on normal tissue often result in severe mobility during treatment course. This disability also limits the role of radiotherapy in cancer treatment. Radiation toxicity occurs either by direct or indirect damage to the DNA (Schulte-Frohlinde 1986). Indirect radiation reaction, which occurs mainly through oxidative free-radicals mechanism, contributes to a large extent to radiobiological effect (Zaider et al. 1994). Damages caused to DNA by ionizing radiation can result in the loss of viability of the cells exposed to radiation. The factors that influence the response of living cells to radiation are tissue type, DNA repair status of damaged cells, local circulation, and physiological status (Pasupathy et al. 2001). In Chinese medicine, radiation could cause so called \u201ctoxic heat\u201d, which can increase inflammatory fever, cause blood damage, loss of intercellular liquid and energy.",

In Chinese medicine, IR is traditionally used to reduce inflammatory factors in blood, and to relieve convulsion. IR is one of the most popular herbal medicines and has been recorded in Chinese Pharmacopoeia since 1985. Purified extracts of IR have been formulated for clinical use. Many chemical compounds are found in IR, including indigotin, indirubin, isatin, isaindigotidione, organic acids, and amino acids (Wu et al. 1997). It is widely studied and reported to have anti-viral, fever detoxification, and anti-inflammatory efficacy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the radioprotective effect of IR, to discuss the underlying mechanism, and then to explore the possibility of clinical applications.",

To determine the amount of indirubin in IR extract powder, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used for quantitative determination of indirubin.

The combined methanol extract was evaporated under reduced pressure at 40 \u00b0C for 4 hours, and the resulting residues were individually redissolved in 5 ml methanol. The analysis was performed on a Agilent 1100 HPLC system (Santa Clara, USA), consisting of a Quanternary pump, an Autosampler, a Thermostated column compartment and an diode array detector. The analytes were separated on a Merck Lichrocard Purospher STAR RP-18e column (250 mm\u00d74.6 mm, i.d., 5 \u03bcm, Merck KGaA, Germany) protected by a guard column (Merck Lichrocard Purospher STAR RP-18e column, 4.0 mm\u00d74.0 mm, i.d., 5 \u03bcm, Merck KGaA, Germany).

Acute exposure to elevated doses of ionizing radiation causes defects in hematopoiesis, resulting in leukocytopenia. In the present study, evidence of significant conservation in the weight of spleen and thymus, and hematopoietic system status shows the radioprotective effect of IR extract powder. The radioprotective ability of IR in the recovery of hematopoietic system is further confirmed by the increase in the spleen and thymus weights in IR-treated groups. In this study, mice exposed to whole body irradiation of 5.4 Gy in three consecutive days and then treated with IR are very effective in stimulating recovery of hematopoietic cells. The mechanisms by which IR stimulate the regeneration of hematopoietic cells might be due to the increase in G-CSF expression. Suzuki et al. reports that the possible mechanism may be attributed to the presence of the therapeutic content, namely, indirubin in IR (Suzuki et al. 2005). Our results shows that the indirubin concentration in IR powder is 4.2\u00b10.1 \u03bcg/ml, which is higher (0.224\u20132.384 \u03bcg/g) than Liau et al. detected in botanical indigowood root (Liau et al. 2007).",

The major cause of mortality in SARS patients are interstitial pneumonia, characterized with a condition of diffuse, chronic inflammation of the lungs beyond the terminal bronchioles (Fowler et al., 2003). Radiation pneumonia occur with similar clinical pictures-acute inflammatory stage and a late fibrotic change (Tsoutsou and Koukourakis 2006). Many chemical compounds in IR are reported in previous studies, including indigotin, indirubin, isatin, isaindigotidione, organic acids, and amino acids (Wu et al. 1997). Recently, indigotin and indirubin have been found as potent aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists (Peter Guengerich et al. 2004). Indirubin and alkaloid isaindigotone are part of water-insoluble components in IR. The methanol extract of IR is proven to have antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic effects in animal study (Ho and Chang 2002). Alkaloid isaindigotone and its derivatives are found to have inhibitive function on leukocytes and act as a scavenger of superoxide either through the hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase system or through stimulated human neutrophils (Molina et al. 2001). Indirubin is reported to be one of the most effective compounds in IR, which have anti-inflammatory and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) inhibitory reaction (Hoessel et al. 1999). Indirubin is also found to have inhibitory action on the expression of the chemokine regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) mRNA expression in influenza-infected bronchial epithelial cells (Mak et al. 2004).",

Radiation is found to induce TNF-\u03b1 which may exacerbate the cytotoxic effects of radiation. Interestingly, TNF-\u03b1 is also found to enhance X-ray killing of human tumor cells in vitro and enhances tumor control when combined with radiotherapy in animal tumor models (Azria et al. 2004). Sakai et al used IL-6 knockout mice to study the cytokines related to radiation pneumonia (Sakai et al. 2008). They found that stable expression of inflammation (CD44) and apoptosis (Bak) markers are observed in IL-6 knockout mice after thoracic irradiation when compared with control group. Moreover, IL-6 is reported to be a biomarker to predict radiation lung toxicity (Kong et al. 2008). In our study, significantly lower serum TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 levels are observed in the IR-treated groups when compared with the control group. These results strengthen the important role of IL-6 in radiation-induced inflammation and imply the potential use of IR in radioprotection.",

Indirubin may play a therapeutic role, but the underlying mechanism is not very clear and warrants further studies.",
