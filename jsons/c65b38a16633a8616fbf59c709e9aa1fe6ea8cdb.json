However, such searches may be due to interest elicited by media coverage of the COVID-19-related smell loss, rather than attempts to understand self-symptoms. We analyzed searches related to 4 senses: smell and taste (both recently shown to be impaired in some COVID-19 patients), vision and sight (senses not currently known to be impaired in COVID-19 patients), and an additional general control (\"COVID-19 symptoms\"). Focusing on two countries with a large number of cases, Italy and the United States, we have compared Google Trends results per region or state to the number of new cases prevalence in that region. The analysis was performed for each of the 8 weeks ranging from March 4th till April 28th.",

Nevertheless, relying solely on Google trends for taste loss and smell loss searches is not a reliable strategy, even though suggested by Goldman and Sachs (Frank, 2020) to monitor the spread of the SARS-CoV-2.
