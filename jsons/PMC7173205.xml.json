Children with PBB demonstrated, within-population normal immunoglobulin levels, antibody responses (to tetanus and H influenzae type b vaccines) and propensity to atopy (IgE and RAST); however, many children had elevated NK-cell levels in blood specimens.

Thus, boys with several months' history of wet cough, who attended childcare, and who were between their first and second birthdays typified our PBB cohort.

The similar rates of wheeze in children with PBB and the control subjects may relate to the high airway malacia rates also observed. However, it is important to acknowledge the inherent inaccuracy of parent-reported wheeze, which poorly reflects true wheeze and asthma27, 28 and has low-level agreement with doctor assessment.29, 30 This fact is likely to contribute to asthma overdiagnosis, particularly in primary care settings.",

We have demonstrated that antibody-mediated responses (to a protein-based [tetanus] and conjugate [H influenzae type b] vaccine) and lymphocyte subsets are normal in PBB, with the exception of elevated levels of NK cells CD16+ and CD56+. This is a novel finding, and likely to be associated with recent viral infection. Although the cross-sectional nature of this study precludes making causal associations, it is probable that the high NK-cell levels seen in children with PBB were related to elevated virus detection rates in BAL specimens (38% of BAL specimens on a standard respiratory panel and 67% of BAL specimens on an extended viral panel). Moreover, the association between HAdV in BAL specimens and NK-cell elevation is consistent with published literature suggesting that NK cells play a role in innate immune defense against HAdV.31 Although we are unable to draw conclusions regarding the significance of HAdV in the airways of children with PBB, it deserves further research. A possible mechanism includes reactivation of HAdV in response to certain stresses, as HAdV can remain in a quiescent state in tonsillar and adenoidal tissue.32\n",

The similar tracheobronchomalacia rates in children with PBB and the control group (53%), and the high rates of bacterial infection (39%) observed in the control group are likely interrelated. These findings reflect the fact that children in the control group had chronic respiratory symptoms leading to bronchoscopy. Another possible explanation for the high rates of bacterial infection in the control group is contamination of the bronchoscope during the procedure. However, our fastidious BAL technique and use of a \u2265 104 CFU/mL cutoff to indicate infection should minimize this likelihood.",

Second, due to the inherent ethical issues regarding use of control subjects for studies involving bronchoscopy, our comparator group comprised children with chronic respiratory symptoms (other than PBB). This likely reduced the strength of our observations. Third, we had missing data on childcare attendance and wheeze, as these questions were introduced later in the course of the study. Last, extended viral panel analyses were only performed on a small subset of participants, limiting our ability to make inferences regarding the significance of other viruses (eg, rhinovirus).",

Our findings illustrate the symptom overlap between PBB and asthma,7, 9 highlighting the importance of clear-cut diagnostic criteria for PBB. The most convincing evidence for PBB in the children studied was a clear response to 2 weeks of amoxicillin-clavulanate antibiotics\u2014a key clinical factor in the diagnosis of PBB. While bronchoscopy has been undertaken in this study and included in our original description of PBB,35 we do not advocate that all children with a chronic wet cough should undergo flexible bronchoscopy. In the Australian guidelines for chronic cough in children,15 the clinical definition of PBB does not include BAL criteria. The validity of this approach was documented in a recent, multicenter, randomized controlled trial on the management of chronic cough in children.36\n",

Children with PBB are, typically, very young boys with protracted wet cough and parent-reported wheeze, and without elevated IgE or eosinophilia, who have attended childcare. Elevated rates of viruses in BAL specimens (in particular, HAdV), and heightened levels of NK cells in blood provide both direct and indirect evidence for a role of viruses in PBB pathogenesis. In view of our findings, we postulate that interactions between the innate immune system, environmental exposures, and viruses and bacteria underlie the development of PBB in children, and further research is needed.",
