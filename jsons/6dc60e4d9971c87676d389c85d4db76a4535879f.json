In this work, we analyze top-ranked finders sold worldwide: Nut Find3, Tile Mate, Tile Pro, musegear finder, Pearl Callstel Key Finder, Gigaset g-tag, and Cube Tracker. Additionally, we analyze a couple of lesser known brands based on the ST17H26 chip that can be managed over various smartphone apps including iTracing, iSearching, and FindELFI. Our analysis uncovers severe security and privacy issues. We reported all issues to the vendors, and most have been fixed by now. However, despite being one of the top-selling finders, Nut still has major security issues. We communicated these more than a year ago over various communication channels and contacted two Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), but Nut servers are still leaking user data. This demonstrates how even today adequate product security is still being neglected by some low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) vendors. Despite the variety of available Bluetooth finders, a solution maintaining privacy has yet to be proposed. Therefore, we design and implement the privacy-preserving secure finder protocol Pri-vateFind for an IoT platform similar to those seen on low-budget finders. Our contributions are as follows:",

Their analysis focused on the Bluetooth interface and forging finder identities to access data. We assume that they used the same standard procedure to analyze all Bluetooth finders since the vulnerabilities found are very similar. Their most outstanding findings are: GPS positions of TrackR Bravo can be queried by finder identifier (CVE-2016-6540); duplicate registration of the same iTrack Easy finder allows to access the device's GPS data (CVE-2016-6543); and Nut transmits reusable session tokens without using Transport Layer Security (TLS), thereby allowing Machine-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks on specific accounts (CVE-2016-6548). The first and second attack require a valid device identifier, meaning that an attacker must either guess it or launch a targeted attack. The third attack's severity depends on the attacker's network position. However, the security analysts did not find any Tile issues despite analyzing it. Yet, we were able to uncover security issues and data leaks, detailed in Section 3.2.2. To the best of our knowledge, Heiland and Compton are the only ones who did security research on Bluetooth finders. No more vulnerabilities on the products we analyzed were listed in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database.",

The category API authentication summarizes how the app authenticates with the server. Typically, such API authentication credentials can be exfiltrated from the app. Firmware location and encryption refers to firmware updates if the finder supports it. Updates are forwarded by the app to the finder because it only communicates via Bluetooth. The app caches the update in some location, ideally encrypted. In some cases, we were able to download firmware updates directly from the server or to decrypt the updates once they were downloaded by the app. Ideally, the Over-the-Air (OTA) update keeps the firmware encrypted at all times until it is decrypted and verified on the finder. If the app is obfuscated, analyzing or changing its functions is more complicated. Non-obfuscated apps come with function names. All apps contained debug strings, which made de-obfuscation easier.

A disadvantage of this approach is an increased load on the server for a property the owner can also verify locally. Moreover, it would require the server to ask for id init to look up the according mf-key, which would deanonymize reports. The server could also restrict usage of their ecosystem to those users who legitimately purchased a finder. For this, the manufacturerverified setup needs to be extended as follows. The server can send a challenge bound to a finder's mf-key that can only be answered by a legitimate finder. If this challenge is answered correctly, the server can either confirm a user's account registration with this, or issue an account-less access token. Later, when users report lost finders or search for them, these actions can be bound to that account or token. While the GPS locations in such an approach remain encrypted, this always reveals the user's or finder's identity.

            "text": "To summarize, the privacy policies of all tested Bluetooth finders with connected features do not accurately reflect what the finders and corresponding apps are doing. Therefore, we would like to encourage the manufacturers to update their privacy policies. A general issue is that the privacy policies in the apps differ from the ones on the websites, and the policies are subject to change. This makes the privacy policies very opaque in addition to missing details on how data is processed and stored.",

Other products automatically reported the user's location to a cloud service without an observable reason. \u2022 Some of the products had minor security vulnerabilities, such as insufficient protection of the API against unauthorized communication. Furthermore, some products omitted proper TLS certificate validation of the backend services. \u2022 A few products had serious security vulnerabilities in their corresponding backend that enabled attackers to obtain access to private data of other users. \u2022 One vendor ignored our reports about those weaknesses for more than a year, despite multiple attempts to get in touch with them over several communication channels. Until today, the corresponding cloud service leaks private customer information that can be accessed easily.",

Many of those security and privacy problems can be fixed easily in the app and the corresponding backend services, for example by not sending any unnecessary data to the cloud service. We decided on a more thorough approach and designed and implemented the privacy-friendly Bluetooth finder PrivateFind that prevents location leakage to the cloud service. Users are able to report a lost and found Bluetooth finder anonymously, and we believe our system achieves a more advanced security and privacy standard than any commercial system we analyzed. Our system provides the same features as most commercial products and runs on the same or comparable hardware. This shows that privacy-friendly and secure Bluetooth finders can be built without increasing expenses for the hardware and without a loss of features for the user.",
