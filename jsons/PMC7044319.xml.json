These outbreaks were associated with clusters of congenital microencephaly and other severe neurological sequelae in infections in approximately 1 of 7 infants born to pregnant women with laboratory confirmed Zika in the US and US territories1. Incidence of ZIKV infections subsequently declined in most of the Americas throughout 2017 and 20182. With the sporadic nature of ZIKV outbreaks and a very low incidence of symptomatic disease in both endemic and non-endemic areas, conducting phase 3 clinical efficacy trials is not feasible. Still, the risk of re-emergence and the severe consequences of infection in pregnant women demonstrate that the need for an effective Zika vaccine remains. In such circumstances, alternative regulatory strategies such as Animal Rule approval or Accelerated Approval pathway may be relevant for licensure3.",

All macaques were seronegative on day 1 and control macaques remained seronegative prior to ZIKV challenge (Fig. 1). Twenty-eight days following the first vaccine dose (study day 29), little or no seroconversion was observed for the 0.016 and 0.08 \u00b5g PIZV doses, while 4/6 macaques vaccinated with the 0.4 \u00b5g PIZV dose seroconverted and 6/6 macaques receiving the 2 and 10 \u00b5g PIZV dose seroconverted. Immune responses were boosted in all groups after the second dose (all p-values \u22640.001). Twenty-eight days after the second PIZV dose (study day 57), 100% of vaccinated macaques seroconverted. The magnitude of neutralizing antibody titers on day 57 was similar after the second dose of 0.4, 2, or 10 \u00b5g, with no statistically significant difference detected among these groups. The titer on day 57 was lower in the 0.016 (p = 0.003) and 0.08 \u00b5g groups (p = 0.037) compared to the 0.4 \u00b5g dose group. Titers prior to ZIKV challenge on day 71 were slightly decreased compared to day 57. Following challenge, neutralizing antibody titers increased significantly in the placebo, 0.016 and 0.08 \u00b5g groups (all p-values \u22640.004), but not in the 0.4, 2, and 10 \u00b5g groups. Neutralizing antibody levels after two PIZV doses of 0.4, 2, or 10 \u00b5g were similar to post-challenge neutralizing antibody titers in the placebo group. In conclusion, we observed a dose-dependent neutralizing antibody response to one or two doses of PIZV. After two PIZV doses, the neutralizing antibody levels reached a plateau for vaccine doses above 0.4 \u00b5g, and the level of neutralizing antibody was comparable to infection with ZIKV challenge in the placebo group. The lack of anamnestic antibody responses after challenge in the 0.4, 2, and 10 \u00b5g PIZV dose groups suggests that infection by ZIKV challenge virus may have been prevented by vaccination.",

Correlation with protection was observed with both neutralizing antibodies (3.02 log10 EC50) and anti-Zika IgG (2.21 log10 U/mL). We chose the functional assay, neutralizing antibodies, to establish a correlate of protection in macaques as a neutralizing antibody titer of >3.02 log10 EC50, which conferred protection against ZIKV serum viremia in Indian rhesus macaques.

Zika neutralizing antibody levels were measured every 28 days through day 365 (except for days 197, 309, and 337), as well as on day 401 (30 days post-ZIKV challenge). All macaques seroconverted following the first vaccine dose, with a significant boost in antibody titers following the second dose (p < 0.001; Fig. 6a). Neutralizing antibody titers peaked on day 57, 28 days following the second immunization, declined from day 57 to day 85, and then remained stable from day 85 to day 401. Anti-Zika IgG levels also peaked on day 57 and subsequently declined through study day 365 (Fig. 6b). IgG titers increased following ZIKV challenge.",

These results are qualitatively similar to those of licensed vaccines against flaviviruses such as JEV, where a neutralizing antibody titer of >10 (as measured by PRNT) is considered to correlate with protection23\u201325. Further supporting this correlate of protection, it has been reported that passive transfer of Zika neutralizing monoclonal antibodies or antisera from vaccinated humans and animals to mice is sufficient to protect against ZIKV challenge16,17,21,26.

We did not assess presence of vRNA in tissues. Our working hypothesis is that prevention of serum ZIKV vRNA may be a surrogate for prevention of the most serious sequelae of ZIKV infection in humans - fetal infection. By employing a PIZV dose titration study design and a ZIKV RVP assay, we have established a minimum protective vaccine dose of 0.4 \u00b5g in rhesus macaques and established a neutralizing antibody correlate of protection against ZIKV challenge of 3.02 log10 EC50. Finally, we demonstrated that ZIKV neutralizing antibodies persist and are capable of preventing ZIKV infection for at least 1 year post-vaccination. In the event that human phase 3 efficacy studies are not feasible, identifying a correlate of protection in an appropriate non-human primate challenge model may be important to support licensure of a Zika vaccine3,5,32. Altogether, these data support neutralizing antibodies as an immune marker that is associated with efficacy in a relevant animal model and that may predict a reasonable likelihood of clinical benefit in humans.",
