They showed that women with nausea and/or vomiting in pregnancy had significantly lower concentration of serum vitamin B6 in comparison to those without this symptom. Also they revealed that Vitamin B6 supplementation increased the plasma level of vitamin B6 concentration. They concluded that vitamin B6 supplementation is unlikely to impose the severity of symptoms. In another study, Qi You et al (2009) evaluated the vitamin B6 points PC6 injection during acupuncture on nausea and vomiting in patients with ovarian cancer. They reported that that acupuncture plus vitamin b6 pc6 point injection is a competent procedure against emesis in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.",
