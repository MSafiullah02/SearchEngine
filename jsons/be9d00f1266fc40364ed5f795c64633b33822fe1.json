Email: premala.nadarajah@nhs.net Keywords: COVID-19; failure modes effect analysis; patient safety; simulation; system engineering Editor -The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created a need for innovative approaches to novel and complex issues surrounding patient care. Emergency physicians, intensivists and anaesthetists play an early and vital role in the management of these high-risk patients, requiring cooperation and information sharing. All National Health Service (NHS) organisations are required to test and refine their pandemic planning 1 . However, the 'real terms' organisational preparedness for these resource-exhaustive scenarios is challenging and reactive policies will be necessary to deal with new rapidly-evolving scenarios. It is of paramount importance that all new guidance developed is locally adapted and tested. Failure to do so may expose both patients and staff to medical errors and harm. A system engineering approach to pathway design is needed.",

We propose a pragmatic and effective approach to develop and test protocols iteratively using prospective risk analysis through FMEA and repeated simulation.",

The first step in the FMEA process is to split a large complex goal into small simpler ones. In this case the complex goal was to transfer a COVID19 patient from one part of the hospital to another. To be able to create a list of what tasks are necessary to complete this challenge requires a list of subgoals that need to be achieved to complete the \"how\". Examples of subgoals in the process of transferring the patient include donning PPE, allocation of staff, and appropriate equipment. These subgoals then require a set of tasks to ensure they are completed. In the case of equipment, the tasks may be to collect the transfer trolley, check oxygen cylinders, and ensure that the ventilator is available and checked. By dividing the process into smaller goals and tasks required to achieve these goals we could then identify the possible failure modes that could impact our ability to complete the complex goal, of transferring the patient safely. This process helped our team identify and prioritise risks in order to find ways to eliminate or mitigate their impact 4 . This is shown in supplementary file 1.",

The findings of the simulation were used to generate a transfer policy, thus refining it and ensuring its safe operational suitability. We performed two high-fidelity transfer scenarios during a full day of training. Scenario A was an urgent transfer of COVID-19 patient from ward to theatre. Scenario B was a labouring COVID-19 patient transferred to theatre for an emergency Cesarean section. The scenarios were facilitated by experts in simulation. FMEA-generated process mapping and a structured debrief was performed on all participants. Careful consideration was given to both operational challenges, technical and non-technical issues such as situational awareness, role allocation, communication, and cognitive load.",

The donning and doffing take a few minutes each and mandate the presence a buddy on a one-to-one basis. As the case burden increases, we foresee that this will become a real issue that needs careful analysis and a pragmatic approach. Doffing carries the highest risk of contamination for staff so particular attention should be paid there 6 . Due to availability of buddies, there might be the need to do sequential donning and doffing which will add a substantial time to the process.

Communication with the runner outside the contaminated clinical area is risk prone. In our scenarios staff used both phones and walkie-talkies. Phones should only be used on speaker mode to avoid risk of contamination. When walkie-talkies were introduced into simulations, we realised the need for closed loop communication using the SBAR approach and the need for appropriate training. Clinicians who were not used to talking through them found them difficult to operate. There are limited amounts of channels and sometimes multiple teams share the same channel. In a situation with increased cognitive and emotional load, there is the potential for error.",

Task allocation is vital to avoid confusion and unnecessary duplication. Our team designed and streamlined a transfer checklist that sets out clear roles for all team members. It also highlights key interventions to increase safety. This is a key intervention, because as the burden of cases increases it may be required to allocate staff with less experience. We strongly recommend using a checklist that is tested and adapted to meet local conditions. Transition of care is a risk-prone process. Multiple studies have shown a correlation between the number of transfers of command and error 7 8 . Essential information may be missed leading to harm. In the event of multiple patients requiring advanced respiratory support there will be an inevitable overspill of patients from the ICU to other clinical areas for which an effective transfer of information and command becomes vital.",
