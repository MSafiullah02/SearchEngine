Subsequent hybridization-selection experiments showed that the complementary region was within a 6.4-kb ClaI fragment derived from the KpnI G fragment ( Figure  iB) . Furthermore, the transfection of plasmid p2025 (containing this ClaI fragment) into cells infected with vaccinia virus induced the synthesis of a 160-kd protein ( Figure 3 , lane C). These results indicated that the 160-kd ATI protein was encoded by a gene contained within the 6.4-kb ClaI fragment.

Mapping of the transcribed region of the 160K gene The direction of transcription of the 160K gene was determined by hybridization selection of mRNA with single-stranded DNAs derived from phage M13 recombinants ml, m2, m3 and m4 ( Figure IC ). Only the DNAs of clones ml and m3 were complementary to mRNA of the 160K gene. This demonstrated that the direction of transcription of this gene was towards the central portion of the viral DNA. Northern blot analyses were used to determine the size of transcripts of the 160K gene. A 2.0-kb AccI fragment contained in plasmid p2031 ( Figure 1C ) was used as the hybridization probe, because its map coordinates (2.2 kb from each end of the 6.4-kb ClaI fragment) were within the predicted 4.3-kb coding region of the 160K gene. Hybridization of this probe to polyadenylated RNA extracted from cells 24 h after CPV infection demonstrated that a late RNA of defined length (4.5 kb) was transcribed from this region (Figure 4 ). This 4.5-kb RNA was not detected in RNA extracted from cells in the early stages of CPV infection (data not shown).",

The proteins in the lysate were then immunoprecipitated with antigen-purified antibody against the 160-kd ATI protein.

The autoradiogram shows the immunoprecipitated in vitro translation products of unselected RNA (lane A), and RNA selected with the KpnI K fragment (lane B), the KpnI G fragment (lane C), and the PstI J fragment (lane D).

The 160-kd ATI protein appears to be the primary translation product of the 160K mRNA (Figure 2 , lane A), therefore these results suggest that the ATG at nucleotide 693 is the translational initiation codon of the 160K gene. The other open reading-frame terminates only 46 bp upstream of the initiation codon of the 160K gene. This short non-coding region includes a 21-bp sequence containing only A and T residues. The open reading-frame upstream of the 160K gene contains an unusual sequence; this sequence (nucleotides 171-254) consists of 28 repeats of the triplet GAT. Its position suggests that at least one of its functions is to encode 28 aspartic acid residues. However, its exact functions remain to be determined.",

The results, shown in Figure 7 , indicated that the major end-points of complementarity were between three and eight nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon. In contrast, primer extension analyses ( Figure 8 , lane 1) indicated that most of the 160K gene's mRNAs contained 5-21 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon.

This indicated that the protection of the poly(dT) residues by the RNA of CPV-infected cells was due to 5'-terminal poly(A)-containing niRNA of the 160K gene. The poly(dT) portion of the oligonucleotide was also unprotected in control experiments in which the RNA of uninfected cells was supplemented with single-stranded DNA copies of the viral DNA complementary to at least 12 nucleotides at the 5'-end of the oligonucleotide (data not shown). This indicated that the protection of the poly(dT) by the CPV RNA was not a consequence of the possible formation of trimolecular hybrids (Lopata et al., 1985) containing the 5'-end of the mRNA of the 160K gene, the 3'-terminal poly(A) tail of an mRNA and the poly(dT)-containing oligonucleotide. In addition, the incomplete protection of the short poly(dT) region is inconsistent with the degree of protection that relatively long 3'-terminal poly(A) tails of mRNAs should have been able to provide. Figure 11 summarizes the results of the analyses of the structure of the 5'-end of the mRNA. It also shows the correlation of these results. The end-points of the primer extensions correspond almost exactly to the end-points of complementarity between the mRNA and the poly(dT)-containing oligonucleotide. The end-points of complementarity between the mRNA and the viral DNA correspond exactly to the region within which the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA begins to differ from that of the viral DNA. All these data indicate that 5'-terminal poly(A) sequences are present immediately upstream of the initiation codons of the mRNAs of the 160K gene.",

Conversely, the results of Sheldon et al. (1972) demonstrating that most of the poly(A) of VV mRNAs are at the RNA's 3'-terminus, appear to be inconsistent with the presence of 5'-terminal poly(A). However, given the methods used, 5'-terminal poly(A), containing on average only 10-15 residues, would have been more difficult to detect than 3'-terminal poly(A), which contains on average 100 residues (Nevins and Joklik, 1975) .",

            "text": "Currently there is little information on the 5'-terminal structures of mRNA of individual late VV genes. The structures of most have been inferred from the results of nuclease SI protection experiments. When attempted, it proved to be difficult to confirm the results of nuclease SI protection experiments by primer-extension analyses (Rosel and Moss, 1985; Rosel et al., 1986; Weinrich and Hruby, 1986 to the presence of overlapping and complementary transcripts. Most likely this was not a problem in the analysis of the 5'-ends of the 160K mRNAs because of the abundance of these mRNAs late in the infection. Recently, Bertholet et al. (1987) and Schwer et al. (1987) used additional methods to characterize the 5'-end structures of mRNAs of two strongly-expressed late VV genes. The results of Bertholet et al. (1987) indicated that each mRNA of the 11K gene contained a leader sequence that was not complementary to sequences upstream of the coding region of the gene. These leaders contained poly(A) sequences fused to the initiation codon of the gene. Most leader sequences also contained additional nucleotide sequences (up to several kb long) Fig. 9 . Nucleotide sequence analysis of cDNA copies of the 5'-end region of the 160K gene's mRNA. The cDNA copies were made by primer extension reactions using the 32P 5'-end-labeled primer described in the legend to Figure 8 . The cDNA products were fractionated by electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea. cDNAs 73-77 nucleotides long (containing 10-14 nucleotides complementary to sequences upstream of the initiation codon) were eluted from the gel, and their nucleotide sequences were determined by base-specific cleavage reactions according to the method of Maxam and Gilbert (1980) . The products of these reactions were resolved by electrophoresis in an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea. The autoradiogram of the gel shows (lane 1) the purified cDNA fragments, and (lanes 2-5) the products of base-specific cleavage reactions at G, G+A, C+T and C residues. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA is shown, where nucleotide + 1 is complementary to the first residue of the initiation codon of the mRNA. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA is identical to that of the template strand of the viral DNA except where indicated by asterisks. (1987) indicated that the mRNAs of both the 11K gene and the 4b gene contained 5'-terminal poly(A) sequences (of -35 residues) fused to the coding region of each gene. Therefore, with respect to the poly(A)-initiation codon sequence, there is considerable similarity between the VV 11K mRNA, the VV 4b mRNA and the CPV 160K mRNA. In each the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA and the corresponding DNA diverge at the site of the three A residues in the conserved DNA sequence 5'-TAAATG-3'. However, there is no evidence that the 160K . : Ii Fig. 10 . The mRNAs of the 160K gene contain poly(A) leader sequences. Thirty-nine base oligonucleotides were synthesized whose sequence (5'-CGTGACCTCCATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGCATG-3') was constructed to be complementary to leader sequences of up to 22 adenosine residues adjacent to the first four codons of the 160K gene's mRNA. The oligonucleotides were 32P 5'-end labeled and hybridized either with RNA from CPV-infected cells or with RNA from uninfected cells. Residual single-stranded nucleic acids were digested with nuclease SI. The nuclease SI resistant products were electrophoresed through a 20% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gel, and labeled DNAs were visualized by autoradiography. The autoradiogram shows: lane 1, portions of the oligonucleotide protected from nuclease SI digestion by hybridization with RNA extracted from CPV- 3'-GTACGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTACCTCCAGTGC-5 Fig. 11 . Comparison of the results of nuclease SI protection and primer extension analyses of the structure of the 5'-ends of the 160K gene's mRNA. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA template strand is shown, the numbering corresponds to that of its complementary strand as shown in Figure 6 . Nucleotides corresponding to the initiation codon of the mRNA are underlined. The arrows above the viral DNA sequence correspond to the major endpoints of complementarity between this template strand of viral DNA and the mRNA (shown below) as determined by nuclease SI analysis. The sequence of the mRNA was derived from nucleotide sequence analysis of cDNA copies of the mRNA. The arrows above the predicted sequence of the mRNA correspond to the major 5'-ends of the mRNA as determined by primer extension analysis. The arrows above the sequence of the oligonucleotide correspond to the major endpoints of complementarity between this DNA and the mRNA. The length of each arrow corresponds to the relative abundance of fragments having endpoints at that site.",

Northern blot analyses (Figure 4) showed that most of the 160K mRNAs are only slightly longer than the transcribed region of the 160K gene. This additional length (-100 bp) is most likely attributable to both 5'-and 3'-poly(A) sequences. Conceivably, the long leaders of the 11K mRNAs and the shorter leaders of the 160K mRNAs are generated by different mechanisms. Alternatively, one or other of these RNA structures might represent either a different stage or a different end-product of a similar pathway of synthesis. The nature of the mechanism that generates the 5'-poly(A)containing 160K mRNAs has not yet been determined. Possible mechanisms include the following: (i) an RNA processing event;",

The first possibility, an RNA processing event, would explain the structure of the RNAs described by Bertholet et al. (1987) . However, currently there is little evidence that 5'-terminal poly(A) is attached to the 160K mRNA in this manner. The second possibility, a mechanism involving RNAprimed transcription, might have limited similarity to the primedtranscription processes of the coronaviruses (Spaan et al., 1983; Baric et al., 1987) or the influenza viruses (Plotch et al., 1981) . The third possibility, the repetitive transcription of T residues prior to elongation, appears to occur during transcription from certain late promoters of the bacteriophage T4. The T4-modified RNA polymerase of E. coli may undergo abortive transcriptional initiation. When this occurs at three T residues, multiple rounds of (i) slippage of the pppApApA product and (ii) subsequent elongation of the product may then generate transcripts containing 5'-poly(A) sequences (Kassavetis et al., 1986) . Such 5'-terminal poly(A) sequences are extensions of the A triplet encoded at the transcriptional start-site. As noted above, all characterized late genes contain a sequence similar if not identical to the sequence 5'-ATTTAC-3' (template strand) at their putative transcriptional initiation sites. Therefore a similar mechanism might generate 5'-terminal poly(A) in late poxvirus mRNAs.",

Phage M13 vectors mpl8 and mpl9 (Norrander et al., 1983) were used to obtain single strands of the cloned DNAs. Hybridization-selection of mRNAs and their in vitro translation were done by standard methods (Ricciardi et al., 1979; Jackson and Hunt, 1983) . Antigenpurified antibody against the 160-kd protein of the CPV ATIs (Patel et al., 1986) was used according to the method of Kessler (1975) to immunoprecipitate the proteins in the in vitro translation mixture. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and then visualized by autoradiography as previously described by Patel et al. (1986) . The method of Cochran et al. (1985a) was used to achieve the transient expression of cloned copies of the 160K gene. Characterization of the DNA containing the 160K gene Restriction endonuclease cleavage sites were mapped by standard methods. The methods of Sanger et al. (1980) and Biggin et al.

The ATG triplet at nucleotide 693 is the only in-frame ATG within 300 bp of the beginning of the transcribed region; Transient expression of the 160K gene. Preconfluent monolayers of human 143 cells were infected with vaccinia virus at a multiplicity of 10 p.f.u./cell. Two hours after infection the cells were transfected with plasmid DNA. Eighteen hours after infection the cells were incubated in the presence of 50 yICi [35S]methionine (1100 Ci/mmol). The cells were harvested 2 h later. Their proteins were solubilized and then resolved by electrophoresis in an 8% polyacrylamide gel. [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. The lanes show the proteins labeled in: (A) cells that were mock-transfected; (B) cells transfected with DNA of the vector pUC19; (C) cells transfected with DNA of plasmid p2025; and (D) cells that were infected with cowpox virus instead of vaccinia virus. Cells transfected with p2025 (C), and cells infected with cowpox virus (D), contain the 160-kd protein.",

A 1.7-kb MspI-EcoRI fragment (probe 1,Figure IC) was [32P]-labeled at the 3'-end generated by the EcoRI cleavage. This hybridization probe was annealed to RNA extracted from 143 cells 24 h after infection with CPV (10 p.f.u./cell). After hybridization, the residual single-stranded nucleic acids were digested with nuclease SI. The nuclease Sl-resistant hybrids were resolved by electrophoresis through a 1% neutral agarose gel. They were then transferred to a nylon membrane, and the[32P]-labeled fragments were visualized by autoradiography. The autoradiogram shows: (A) [32P] endlabeled Hinfl restriction fragments of pBR322 DNA; (B) [32P]-labeled probe DNA protected from digestion by hybridization with RNA from CPVinfected cells; (C) the products of nuclease SI digestion of probe I DNA after hybridization with calf liver tRNA; and (D) the intact probe I DNA.The size of the protected fragment (1.25 kb) was estimated from its electrophoretic mobility relative to the mobilities of the Hinfl fragments of pBR322 DNA.",
