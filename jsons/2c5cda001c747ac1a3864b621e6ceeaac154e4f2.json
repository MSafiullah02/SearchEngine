R\u00f8nning (2017) examined calculus for engineers using Maple TA, a similar system to WebAssign. His observations were based on student surveys and interviews. R\u00f8nning reports that with PPT students spend time preparing a response for the instructor, thus focusing their energies on the process more than obtaining the correct answer. In contrast, with CBTs they spend their effort focused on obtaining the correct answer with less attention or focus on the process that was used. He argues that in upper level mathematics (e.g., calculus) this is particularly problematic where process and proofs have greater importance than in lower level courses. This is highlighted by the important role partial credit plays in assessment in mathematics. Partial credit is a means by which instructors can provide guidance to students during the learning process, perhaps rewarding a correct process while not ignoring a calculation error that led to an incorrect answer. CBTs may attempt to mimic this with answer-until-correct type items, but R\u00f8nning claims, this fundamentally changes the nature of the task, reducing it to a \"hunting for the correct answer\" task with increasingly fewer incorrect options (2017, p. 101).",

One might expect the mode of testing could affect the raw scores of CBT and PPT.

The vehicle for this phenomena would likely be a change in preparation behavior of students (Bennett, 2014) .

Our tests were functioning class topic tests.

Our items were random, but not completely. When the test topic was Taylor series, a question would Computer-based and paper-and-pencil tests 8 be to compute the Taylor series of a function, but the function would be randomized. Tests reflect a selection of homework from the textbook, which are mainstream. By 2014 Stewart's Calculus was \"used globally by about 70 per cent of students of mathematics, science, and engineering\" (Baldassi, 2014, para. 3) .

There are mean preferences for PPT over both the combined (PPT/CBT) and the combined over the CBT sections, but the non-significant p-values are 0.377 and 0.221, respectively. The complete ANCOVA is consistent with PPT improving student learning. This conclusion is also consistent with the results from method A.

Add to the consistent trend of the results, that the comparison of the PPT section (1) and the fully computer section (3) yielded moderately significant p<0.084 in the ANCOVA, we think the results give mild support to PPT. The point difference between these two sections was 3.7/100.

We made the expectations of the Computer-based and paper-and-pencil tests 27 assessments transparent to all students prior to the test with sample problems.

Issues that were not relevant for WebAssign's use as a homework system. When the technical issues are settled, there is the question of PPT versus CBT as assessment tools.
