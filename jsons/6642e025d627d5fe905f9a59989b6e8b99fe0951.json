There is a real sense of urgency from the news media that this COVID-19 global pandemic, along with government shutdowns is threatening not only our economy, but most importantly the health and the delivery of healthcare to our nation. We are living in extraordinary times. I listen to millennials who lament that 'it is not supposed to be like this in America; perhaps in third world countries, but not in our country. It is unprecedented that entire cities throughout the United States have shut down like ghost towns. However, reflecting back on the past 20 years, perianesthesia nurses have courageously accepted the call to practice in uncertain times, and yes under adverse conditions.",

            "text": "On September 11, 2001, the United States was under attack. In New York City, perianesthesia nurses performed expanded nursing roles in diverse dimensions. Whether they emerged from the subway near St. Vincent's Hospital to work in the emergency department, hoping for survivors, or they were trapped in an apartment building almost adjacent to the World Trade Center, they functioned as nurses first in caring for community. In the dark, in apartment complexes with fresh debris, soot, and smoke, these nurses guided mothers and children down 20 flights of unlit stairs to safety. The power was out, and the calming voice and authority of those who identified themselves as nurses led them outside to safer ground. In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused devastating flooding and when the floods started to surge, PACU nurses found their roles drastically different with the no power for ventilators, using bag valve masks for patients as they waited together to be rescued. The toolkit will pop up and will be updated periodically as current evidence is known. ASPAN President Amy Dooley, MS, RN, CPAN, CAPA, recounts that \"we never know what is going to happen, or when, or where, but we are always prepared to act to keep our patients safe and provide the highest quality care.\" 1 Providing this timely resource for our members that encompasses strategies for caring for the perianesthesia nurse and in greater detail for the COVID-19 positive patient is essential. It is important to recognize that the perianesthesia nurse's institutional COVID-19 guidelines may differ from what is presented in the toolkit. It is always the nurse's obligation to follow standards, guidelines and policies of the workplace.",

Please remember we may be asked to adapt to new working environments where we have reduced staff, increased acute patient needs, and in some hospitals across the country unbelievable stresses on key supply availability. We have noticed that families, visitors and even some staff have been taking our hand sanitizers, cavi-wipes, surgical masks, and even our isolation gowns. This hoarding of supplies inevitably leads to more stress among our colleagues. Now nurses are faced with rationing precious equipment and supplies as they are challenged with making difficult ethical patient care decisions. We have learned that experiences from unprecedented terrorist attacks (9/11, Aurora Theater, Boston Marathon, Las Vegas, and others, too many to mention), natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, as well as combat situations have demonstrated that the medical and nursing care of mass casualties of disasters pose unparalleled ethical dilemmas not normally encountered. 2 ASPAN recognizes that current conditions in US hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers are rapidly shifting/escalating from standard operations to emergent/extreme/surge activity(ies). The following recommendations are intended to guide perianesthesia nurses who may be working in those extreme situations.\" 1",

            "text": "In the summer of 2011, I was mobilized to the NATO Role 3 MultiNational Medical Unit in Kandahar Afghanistan where an international cadre of military nurses became team members to work as postanesthesia trauma critical care nurses. In just five days, we transitioned to our new expanded trauma critical care roles with the help of experienced intensive care unit (ICU) nurse colleagues. The ICU and the trauma teams really built on the strengths of our diverse nurse colleagues and minimized our weaknesses. Everyone (nurses, corpsmen, and doctors) shared unique, complex critical care competency skills and expertise to care for the most devastating injuries imaginable. Each day we became more confident in the ICU and adjusted to not only the hospital, but also to military life in Afghanistan. Ironically now, I am teaching nurses in my civilian hospital safe transport of COVID-19 patients from the emergency department to our Bio-Containment Unit, utilizing knowledge and skills from reserve nurse corps training in military biologic warfare skills. Nurses are clamoring for education and training about COVID -19 to be prepared for practicing in these uncertain times. Background The past several weeks, our American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses (ASPAN) National Office began to receive phone calls and online clinical practice queries from direct care nurses, nurse educators and nurse managers about standards of care related to the COVID-19 pandemic. ASPAN leaders also share in these experiences with first-hand operational challenges, including hospitals plans regarding increased surge capacity and possibly expanded scope of practice with unique expectations of perianesthesia units and nursing staff. After all, the PACU has a wealth of critical care nurses and physical space complete with advanced physiologic monitoring. It may well be underutilized at this time due to elective surgery cancellations. One example included Preoperative (PreOp) units being converted to \"Clean\" Medical ICUs with ventilated patients in a hospital that converted Medical ICUs dedicated for COVID-19 patients. I participated in a national taskforce to develop this ASPAN toolkit this past weekend. Nationally, perianesthesia nursing units are being directed to change or expand their scope of care due to the expected surge capacity from the COVID-19 patients. ASPAN leaders felt compelled to provide perianesthesia nurses with a resource of information and have posted the COVID-19 Toolkit 1 for the perianesthesia Nurse on the ASPAN webpage www.aspan.org.",

However, if you are a perianesthesia nurse who has been deployed to another unit, caring for patients in a surge situation or critical care unit, or other types of patients, or working under a different type of care delivery system due to the emergency response of your institution, follow the institutional standards of care that have been put in place for this pandemic.",
