HLH is a difficult to diagnose disease due to its low incidence and nonspecific clinical manifestations. It progresses as a severe systemic inflammatory syndrome, with a large clinical overlap with sepsis; however, the prognosis and treatment of the 2 diseases are very different. HLH has a poorer prognosis and requires treatment with chemotherapy and, in some cases, bone marrow transplantation, while severe sepsis has a better prognosis and is treated with antimicrobials. The early diagnosis and treatment of HLH can dramatically improve the prognosis; however, the decision to administer immunosuppressants to a patient who has an infectious disease, such as the one we just presented, requires clinical expertise and prudence.",

The frequency of the various forms of HLH varies according to age. In patients between 14 and 29 years of age, HLH associated with infection (HLH-I) was the most common (68% of cases, half of them associated with EBV infection). In this age group, the second leading cause was HLH associated with autoimmune diseases (MAS: 22%), followed by HLH associated with tumors (HLH-T: 10%). In the patient group aged 30\u201359 years, HLH-T occurred somewhat less frequently than HLH-I (37% and 47%, respectively), followed by MAS (9%) and HLH associated with bone marrow transplantation (7%). In the patient group older than 60 years, neoplasms were the most common cause (68%), followed by infections (26%; only one quarter with EBV) and MAS (6%). Another recent retrospective Swedish study showed an annual incidence of HLH-T in adults of 0.36 cases/100,000 individuals/year.8\n",

We suspect this disease when faced with a patient with high fever and multiple-organ dysfunction, especially if they do not respond to the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. If hemophagocytosis is not observed in the first bone marrow biopsy, it is advisable to repeat the biopsy, given that it might be present at the start of the symptoms. Very high ferritin levels, or those that rapidly increase, are highly suggestive of HLH. A ferritin level >10,000 \u03bcg/L has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 96% for HLH, almost without overlapping with sepsis, infections or hepatic failure.17 For all patients, even adults, we cannot rule out the familial forms without analyzing the genetic mutations that define them (Table 3). It is important to identify the presence of potential triggers (Table 2), given that the early treatment of these conditions can sometimes eliminate the stimulation of the immune activation and clinically improve the HLH, which thereby avoids more toxic immunosuppressant treatments. To investigate an infectious etiology according to the clinical presentation and epidemiology, appropriate microbiological tests should be performed (Table 4\n).18 When ruling out the presence of viral infections, viral load determinations by molecular techniques are of more assistance than serological studies.",

It is likely that this association has been underestimated, given the clinical and laboratory result similarities between HIV infection and HLH. Approximately 10%-20% of bone marrow biopsies of HIV-positive patients show signs of hemophagocytosis before the start of antiretroviral treatment.13, 14, 46 Opportunistic infections or neoplasms can be observed in cases of acute or chronic HIV infection and associated with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (associated with the start of antiretroviral treatment).2, 47 HLH can also be the initial presentation of HIV infection. Other common viral triggers of HLH in patients with HIV are EBV, CMV and HHV-8. In a recent series, 55% of patients presented HLH-T (especially lymphomas), and 41% were associated with underlying infections (especially herpes virus and tuberculosis infections). The series had a mortality rate of approximately 30% (similar in HLH-I and HLH-T), whether the patients underwent specific treatment for the HLH or not.16, 47 A number of authors have related CMV infection to HLH associated with HIV infection and recommend starting with anti-CMV treatment (ganciclovir or foscarnet) in these cases.2, 23\n",
