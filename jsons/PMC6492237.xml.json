            "text": "The observation of recurring floral phenotypes associated with distinct pollinator groups has given rise to the concept of pollination syndromes (Delpino, 1890; Vogel, 1954; Stebbins, 1970; Faegri & van der Pijl, 1979; Endress, 1996). Pollinators are grouped into functional categories, i.e. groups of animals probably exerting similar selective pressures on flowers as a result of shared morphology, foraging behaviour/preferences and sensory abilities (Fenster et al., 2004). Thus, flowers pollinated by the same functional group of pollinators are expected to converge onto similar phenotypes in response to selection imposed by the most effective pollinators (defined as the product of visitation frequency and pollen transfer efficiency; e.g. Armbruster, 1988; Ne'eman et al., 2010; Ashworth et al., 2015; Fenster et al., 2015). Although a large body of literature reports pollination syndromes for certain plant lineages (L\u00e1zaro et al., 2008; Armbruster et al., 2011; Lagomarsino et al., 2017), and a recent quantitative evaluation of the concept found strong support even across angiosperms (Rosas\u2010Guerrero et al., 2014), other studies have raised concerns about the utility of the concept (e.g. Waser et al., 1996; Kingston & McQuillan, 2000; Ollerton et al., 2009). Major points of criticism include an over\u2010simplification of complex plant\u2013animal interactions, a lack of clear terminology and difficulties in making comparisons across different taxonomic levels (summarized by Ollerton et al., 2009). Not all \u2018classical\u2019 traits (e.g. red coloration in bird syndrome, musty odour in bat syndrome) are necessarily equally selected for in all systems or geographical regions (Rosas\u2010Guerrero et al., 2014). Besides selection generated by pollinator effectiveness, the evolution of floral traits may also be mediated by antagonistic interactions (e.g. red coloration as bee avoidance in hummingbird flowers; Papiorek et al., 2014), competition for pollinators (e.g. colour variation in hummingbird\u2010pollinated Iochrominae; Muchhala et al., 2014) or the evolutionary history of the clade, and the developmental constraints embedded therein (e.g. constraints of possible floral trait combinations; Smith & Rausher, 2008; O'Meara et al., 2016). These interactions may lead to narrower, clade\u2010specific syndromes (e.g. P\u00e9rez et al., 2006; Johnson, 2013; Serrano\u2010Serrano et al., 2017).",

Indeed, Rosas\u2010Guerrero et al. (2014) showed that there is a non\u2010random association of pollination syndromes (e.g. bee\u2013hummingbird, hummingbird\u2013bat) and that ancestral pollinators are often retained as secondary pollinators as long as they do not incur a fitness cost (see also Aigner, 2006).",

Many existing studies focus on a reduced set of traits primarily from the \u2018attraction\u2019 component (e.g. colour, reward and scent). This is particularly troublesome as the literature suggests stronger selection on the \u2018utilization\u2019 component (fitted with the pollinator to ensure pollen transfer, \u2018efficiency function traits\u2019; Ordano et al., 2008; Rosas\u2010Guerrero et al., 2011). Thus, it is timely to take a novel approach to pollination syndrome studies. Here, we integrate pollinator observations and floral trait data on both \u2018classical\u2019 syndrome traits and any trait that may be relevant for our study system (\u2018bottom up\u2019 approach outlined by Ollerton et al., 2009), and use multivariate analyses to detect convergent associations between flower traits and pollinators (\u2018top down\u2019 approach; Ollerton et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Buzz\u2010pollination by bees has evolved independently in many angiosperm lineages (found in at least 72 families) and is present in c. 22 000 species (Cardinal et al., 2018). A typical buzz\u2010pollinated flower is characterized by poricidal anthers, lack of nectar and pollen being the sole reward offered to pollinating bees (Buchmann, 1983). The functional group of \u2018buzzing bees\u2019 is taxonomically and morphologically highly diverse, as bees from at least 74 genera (seven families) are capable of producing distinct high\u2010frequency vibrations (\u2018buzz\u2019) (de Luca & Vallejo\u2010Mar\u00edn, 2013; Cardinal et al., 2018). The buzz\u2010pollination syndrome is not evenly distributed across angiosperms, however; whilst some lineages contain only a few species adapted for buzz\u2010pollination, some genera, such as Solanum, and families, such as Melastomataceae, show a conspicuous predominance of buzz\u2010pollination. In the latter, an estimated 98% of the c. 5000 species are buzz\u2010pollinated (Renner, 1989; Berger et al., 2016). Evolutionary success has been proposed as an explanation for the prevalence of buzz\u2010pollination in Melastomataceae, balancing the majority of species on an \u2018adaptive peak\u2019 (Macior, 1971). Given the considerable floral disparity (morphological diversity) amongst buzz\u2010bee\u2010pollinated Melastomataceae (e.g. genus Leandra; Reginato & Michelangeli, 2016), it is probably more appropriate to speak of an \u2018adaptive plateau\u2019 on which the family is wandering. Interestingly, recent studies have reported various departures from the buzz\u2010pollination syndrome to alternative pollinators (flies, wasps, hummingbirds, bats, passerines and rodents) in Melastomataceae (Lumer, 1980; Renner, 1989; Vogel, 1997; Dellinger et al., 2014; Brito et al., 2017). Although not yet formally tested, these shifts seem to be associated with complex changes in reward type (from pollen to nectar; Varassin et al., 2008 or to food bodies; Dellinger et al., 2014) or pollen expulsion mechanisms (e.g. from buzzing to a bellows mechanism; Dellinger et al., 2014). As buzz\u2010pollinated flowers represent a functionally highly complex, specialized pollination system very distinct from the majority of bee pollination systems, an understanding of trait combinations and associated new syndromes derived therefrom is particularly interesting.",

            "text": "Here, we analyse the floral morphology and pollination ecology of members of the Neotropical Melastomataceae tribe Merianieae (c. 300 species), which offers an ideal model system to investigate floral adaptations to different functional pollinator groups. Buzz\u2010pollination is clearly ancestral in Merianieae and independent shifts to different vertebrate pollination systems (including mixed hummingbird/bat and passerine pollination) have occurred repeatedly (Dellinger et al., 2014; see the Results section). We use state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art statistical tools (random forests, Johnson, 2013; morphospaces, Chartier et al., 2017) to (1) describe the pollination syndromes (based on 61 floral traits) of 19 Merianieae species with known pollinators, (2) determine the respective roles of \u2018classical\u2019 pollination syndrome traits and Merianieae\u2010specific traits, and (3) predict pollinators for 42 species, for which pollinators have never been observed. This enables us to provide a broad understanding of the floral morphologies that characterize the \u2018buzz\u2019\u2010morphology as the evolutionary starting point in Merianieae, and to understand the floral trait changes that have occurred along the evolutionary paths away from the \u2018buzz\u2010pollination plateau\u2019 to different vertebrate pollination systems. Furthermore, by mapping pollination syndromes onto a phylogeny, we provide evidence that floral adaptations in Merianieae indeed represent convergences to different functional pollinator groups, as postulated under the pollination syndrome concept.",

Our floral dataset is based on direct field observations, photographs, descriptions on herbarium sheet labels, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), light microscopy and high\u2010resolution X\u2010ray computed tomography (HR\u2010XCT). For SEM, flowers were dissected and, for each species, the hypanthium, one petal, two stamens and one style were prepared (for details on preparation, see Dellinger et al., 2014). For HR\u2010XCT, entire flowers or stamens of 57 species were placed into a contrasting agent (1% phosphotungstic acid\u201370% ethanol) for 4 wk and mounted for scanning by placing them into plastic cups (Semadeni Plastics Group, Ostermundigen, Switzerland) with acrylic pillow foam arranged around the samples to prevent them from moving during the scanning procedure (for details on the HR\u2010XCT methodology, see Staedler et al., 2013, 2018). Three\u2010dimensional models of flowers and stamens were reconstructed (XML\u2010Reconstructor) and visualized in the software amira; raw scan data have been deposited on the open source platform Phaidra (https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/).",

In addition, we monitored pollinators using video cameras (Sony Camcorder, Tokyo, Japan) and direct observations at field sites in Ecuador (2016/2017) and Costa Rica (2015/2018) for 11 more species (Tables 1, S2). We filmed single inflorescences during daytime (06:00\u201318:00 h) and night monitored (18:00\u201300:00 h) five species. For each video, we replayed a minimum of three random 30\u2010min intervals using the software playmemorieshome (total average of 11.3 h of daytime and 8.2 h of night\u2010time observation per species). We scored visitors as pollinators if they caused pollen release from stamens and came into contact with stigmas. Floral visitors were classified as \u2018buzz\u2010bee\u2019, \u2018hummingbird\u2019, \u2018bat\u2019, \u2018flowerpiercer\u2019 (nectar\u2010consuming passerine birds), \u2018passerine\u2019 (in this study, including Thraupidae visiting flowers for non\u2010nectar rewards) and \u2018rodent\u2019 (Table 1). Bat and rodent visits to Meriania were recorded only during the night. This resulted in a total of 19 species with known pollinators in Merianieae. Of these species, six (M. aff. sanguinea, M. furvanthera, M. phlomoides, M. pichinchensis, M. sanguinea and M. tomentosa) are pollinated by two types of pollinators (e.g. diurnal hummingbirds and nocturnal bats, see Table 1) and would usually be classified into two different functional groups (e.g. Faegri & van der Pijl, 1979). In Meriania, these pollinators actually all visit flowers looking for the same reward (nectar). For the two other nectar\u2010producing species, M. costata and M. quintuplinervis, no nocturnal observations were made, but additional nocturnal pollinators (bats and/or rodents) cannot be ruled out. This lack of information must be treated with care in pollinator classification analyses (see next paragraph).",

In RF analyses, a large number of decision trees are built on subsets of data by trying different variables at each node and assessing the quality of the specific variable in reducing the tree's entropy (i.e. power of character in splitting data into known classes). As only 63% of input data are used in each tree, the remaining out\u2010of\u2010bag (OOB) observations are used to estimate classification error and reduction in model accuracy when one character is removed (reduction in Gini index; Cutler et al., 2007). We ran two different models: (1) a \u2018six\u2010syndrome model\u2019 separating pollinators into six functional pollinator groups (\u2018buzz\u2010bee\u2019, \u2018hummingbird/?\u2019, \u2018hummingbird/bat\u2019, \u2018hummingbird/rodent\u2019, \u2018flowerpiercer/rodent\u2019, \u2018passerine\u2019); and (2) a \u2018three\u2010syndrome model\u2019 separating pollinators into three functional groups (\u2018buzz\u2010bee\u2019, \u2018mixed\u2010vertebrate\u2019 and \u2018passerine\u2019). The \u2018mixed\u2010vertebrate\u2019 group encompasses all nectar\u2010secreting Merianieae species where pollinators foraging for nectar cause pollen release when inserting tongues/bills/heads into flowers, and hence possibly selected for a common pollen expulsion mechanism (to compare the flower morphology of these species, see Fig. S1). We calculated 100 RFs of 500 trees each and seven variables tried at each split (mtry). The importance of each variable (floral character) in separating the pollinator groups was ranked by the mean decrease in Gini index over all 100 RFs. All analyses were run using the randomforest package 4.6\u201012 (Liaw & Wiener, 2002) in R 3.3.0 (R Core Team, 2017).",

            "text": "To ascertain whether pollinator shifts in Merianieae have occurred repeatedly, and hence similar floral phenotypes indeed represent convergences to different pollinator groups as assumed under the concept of pollination syndromes, we used a trimmed phylogeny for the 61 Merianieae species included in this study. The presented phylogeny stems from larger phylogenetic analyses for the entire Merianieae, which will be discussed in detail elsewhere (F.A. Michelangeli et al., unpublished; for details, see Table S5). The expanded Merianiae phylogeny has 190 terminals representing 150 taxa of Merianieae and eight outgroups (four species of Miconieae, three species of Physeterostemon and one species of Eriocnema). Some species for which species boundaries are problematic are represented by more than one accession. Total genomic DNA was isolated from silica\u2010dried or herbarium material using the DNAeasy plant mini kit from Qiagen (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the modifications suggested by Alexander et al. (2007) and Martin et al. (2008). Some samples were isolated using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method as modified by Doyle & Doyle (1987), scaled down for 600 \u03bcl of extraction buffer. The molecular dataset includes six loci markers, including two nuclear ribosomal loci (internal and external transcribed spacers, nrITS and nrETS) and four plastid loci (portions of the ndhF and rbcL genes and the intergenic spacers accD\u2010psaI and psbK\u2010psbL). All of these regions have been widely used in Melastomataceae systematics, and PCR primers and conditions follow Clausing & Renner (2001), Fritsch et al. (2004), Michelangeli et al. (2004, 2008, 2013), Martin et al. (2008), Reginato et al. (2010) and Kriebel et al. (2015). Cycle sequencing was performed with the same forward and reverse primers as used for amplification through the high\u2010throughput sequencing service of the University of Washington or Macrogen (Rockville, MD, USA). Sequence contigs were built with sequencher 4.9 (GeneCode Corp., Ann Arbor, MI, USA) or geneious v7.1.9. (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand). Sequence alignment was performed with muscle (Edgar, 2004) as implemented through the geneious plugin. Sequence evolution models for each locus were set to GTR. Separate phylogenetic analyses were conducted for each dataset using maximum likelihood (ML) in RaxML v. 8.2.10 (Stamatakis, 2014) and run through the cipres Science Gateway (http://www.phylo.org/; Miller et al., 2010). Rapid bootstrapping (BS) was performed on the ML tree using RaxML at 1000 replicates to determine branch support. Once we had ensured that there was no topological conflict among loci (BS threshold > 70), all loci were combined into a single matrix. ML was run on the combined matrix with six partitions maintaining the same parameters as above.",

Four characters (mode of pollen expulsion, reward type, relative position of stigma vs corolla opening, presence of filament ruptures) were particularly informative, as the removal of any of these characters reduced the mean model accuracy (and hence the accuracy of pollination syndrome classification) by > 5% (Table 2). Floral characters vary in their predictive power among syndromes: certain characters were more predictive for one syndrome than for the other two, reflected by differences in reduction in syndrome\u2010specific model accuracy (Table 2). For instance, all flowers in the \u2018mixed\u2010vertebrate\u2019 syndrome are pendant, whereas flower orientation varies in the other two syndromes. When comparing the relative importance of \u2018classical\u2019 pollination syndrome traits, eight of 14 fell within the 20 most important characters, whereas the remaining six were of less importance (Table 2).

Features shared by all \u2018buzz\u2010bee\u2019 syndrome species in Merianieae are the pollen reward and buzz\u2010pollination (Table 3). Corollas are wide bowl\u2010shaped to reflexed with papillate petal epidermis, providing a landing platform for pollinating bees (Figs 1a\u2013g, S3a). Flower colours range from white to orange, fuchsia and lilac, with stamens forming a strong colour contrast against the petals (Fig. 1a,c,e,f). Stamens are either distributed more or less regularly in the flower (Fig. 1a,b, group 1) or arranged on one side of the flower (thus monosymmetric appearance, Fig. 1c\u2013g, groups 2 and 3); heteranthery is found in some species in groups 2 and 3. Anthers can be erect (group 1), bringing pores close to the stigma (Fig. 1b), or remain geniculate (the condition found in bud stage in all species) with pores remaining close to the base of the style in the floral centre (Fig. 1d,g; groups 2 and 3). Stamen appendages in Merianieae are always dorsal; in groups 2 and 3 conspicuous and large (Figs 1e,f, 2b), in group 1 small and acuminate (Fig. 1c). Thecae are located on the ventral side of the connective and usually have strongly corrugated and rigid walls (Figs 1b,d,g, S3d,g); pollen can only be released by applying strong vibrations (buzzes). Pores may be located on the ventral (group 1) or dorsal (groups 2 and 3) side of the anther. Styles are usually exserted and often strongly curved right beneath the stigma. In many species, stigmas are small and punctiform. In species of groups 1 and 2 (flower diameter < 2 cm), visiting bees were seen to crouch above the entire androecium, head pointing towards the flower centre, and buzzing the entire androecium. In large\u2010flowered species of group 3 (flower diameter > 2 cm), pollinating bees oriented their bodies in parallel to individual stamens, with their head at the appendage and their abdomen pointing towards the pores. They bit into the appendage and buzzed individual stamens at a time. Thus, the \u2018buzz\u2010bee\u2019 syndrome encompasses three distinct flower morphologies and two different types of interaction between flowers and buzzing bees.",

Colours range from white, pinkish, salmon to scarlet red, and flowers are often scented. All species have androecia arranged on one side of the flower and stamens undergoing a strong deflexion movement in the early phase of anthesis, bringing pores close to stigmas (anthers erect, Fig. 1i). Stamen appendages are mostly smaller than in bee\u2010pollinated group 3 species (Fig. 2b), and relatively inconspicuous coloration (same colour as anther) in some species (e.g. M. tomentosa (hummingbird/bat)), but larger and contrasting in colour to thecae in others (e.g. M. sanguinea (hummingbird/rodent)). Heteranthery is absent in all species with known pollinators. In many species, thecae are attached laterally to the connective and have a soft, easily deformable (e.g. by a hummingbird's bill) wall (Fig. S3e,h). Apical anther pores are usually directed towards the stigma. Styles are often straight, not exceeding the corolla length, and often bear enlarged, slightly flattened stigmas. Vertebrate pollinators insert their bills, tongues or heads into the pseudo\u2010campanulate corollas to lick nectar aggregated on petals beneath the stamens. To reach the nectar, they have to push through the densely arranged anthers and thereby touch the soft, laterally attached thecae and cause pollen release from the apical pores. As all stamens are arranged with pores pointing downwards, out of the pendant flower, we term this mechanism \u2018salt\u2010shaker\u2019\u2010like pollen release. Table 3 summarizes the most important features differentiating the \u2018mixed\u2010vertebrate\u2019 from the \u2018buzz\u2010bee\u2019 syndrome: pendant, pseudo\u2010campanulate flowers in combination with erect stamens, nectar rewards, and soft, easily deformable thecae from which pollen can be released by applying external pressure.",

Colours range from white, light pink to red. In all species, the brightly coloured stamen appendages form a strong colour contrast with the corolla. Stamens are arranged on one side of the flower (monosymmetric) and, in contrast with the \u2018mixed\u2010vertebrate\u2019 syndrome, they do not deflex during anthesis, so that pores remain more or less around the mid\u2010length of the style (Fig. 1k). Most species show moderate heteranthery (appendage volume and colour). Thecae are located on the ventral side of the connective and have a smooth, sturdy wall (Fig. S3f,i). Pores are located on the dorsal side of the anther. Styles are usually partially exserted from the urceolate corollas, with relatively small, conical stigmas. Pollen release is ultimately connected to the ubiquitous bulbous appendages: besides functioning as sugary food body reward, the bulbous appendages work as \u2018bellows\u2019 organs (Dellinger et al., 2014). When passerines grab the appendages for consumption, the compression forces contained air into and through the thecae, dusting the birds with pollen grains that are ejected out of the apical thecal pores. Thus, the bulbous stamen appendages are the most important character differentiating the \u2018passerine\u2019 syndrome from both \u2018buzz\u2010bee\u2019 and \u2018mixed\u2010vertebrate\u2019 syndromes (Table 3).",

Three \u2018buzz\u2010bee\u2019 syndrome clusters could be distinguished, encompassing very different floral morphologies: small\u2010flowered species with reflexed petals and erect stamens (Fig. 1a,b; group 1, differentiated mostly by PCO3, Fig. S6); large\u2010flowered species with reflexed petals and geniculate stamens (Fig. 1e\u2013g; group 3), which occupied a large and distinct area of the space (negative PCO1, positive PCO2); and bee\u2010pollinated species with urceolate corollas and slightly erect stamens (Fig. 1c,d, group 2), which occupied an area close to the \u2018passerine\u2019 syndrome.

            "text": "Our results corroborate the general concept of pollination syndromes and allow the detection and description of convergence of multiple floral traits into three distinct pollination syndromes in Merianieae: the ancestral \u2018buzz\u2010bee\u2019, the \u2018mixed\u2010vertebrate\u2019 and the \u2018passerine\u2019 syndromes (Fig. 2a). These syndromes are best described by a series of traits specific to Merianieae, rather than by \u2018classical\u2019 pollination syndrome characters, as indicated by the relatively low contribution to the differentiation model of the latter type of character (Tables 2, S6; Faegri & van der Pijl, 1979; Ollerton et al., 2009; Serrano\u2010Serrano et al., 2017). Our results generally support the hypothesis that \u2018attraction\u2019 traits (e.g. exposure of flower, display size, scent, colour, flower symmetry and timing of anthesis) are less important in differentiating syndromes than \u2018efficiency\u2019 traits involved in the direct physical interaction between flower and pollinators (e.g. flower shape and orientation, position of reproductive organs). This is particularly important for two reasons. First, most studies on phenotypic selection detected selection only on attraction traits (e.g. Armbruster et al., 2005). Attraction traits, however, can be subject to opposing selection in the presence of floral antagonists or trade\u2010offs in pollen delivery, and hence selection will be less consistent and weaker than on traits involved in accurate pollen transfer (e.g. Armbruster et al., 2005; Strauss & Whittall, 2006; Rosas\u2010Guerrero et al., 2011). Second, \u2018classical\u2019 syndrome characters, such as the \u2018attraction\u2019 traits colour and display size, are regularly included in studies on pollination syndromes (Lagomarsino et al., 2017; Wilson et al., 2017), whereas \u2018efficiency\u2019 traits, such as anther\u2013stigma distance, have generally received less attention. At least in Merianieae, certain \u2018classical\u2019 syndrome characters either did not vary consistently between syndromes (e.g. timing of anthesis (most flowers are open during day\u2010 and night\u2010time); flower size (both smallest and largest flowers are found in the \u2018buzz\u2010bee\u2019 syndrome)), or they contradicted traditional syndrome expectations (e.g. floral colour (many pale pink and white bird\u2010pollinated flowers instead of the \u2018red\u2013bird\u2019 association)). We wish to point out, however, that one \u2018classical\u2019 syndrome trait (reward type) involved in pollinator attraction was the second\u2010most important character in differentiating syndromes (see discussion on association of reward and androecium).",

            "text": "The difficulty in delimiting \u2018classical\u2019 pollination syndromes in Merianieae is further illustrated by the \u2018mixed\u2010vertebrate\u2019 syndrome. Pollination syndrome theory (e.g. Faegri & van der Pijl, 1979) would split the various combinations of different vertebrate pollinators that we observed visiting Merianieae species (\u2018hummingbird/?\u2019, \u2018hummingbird/bat\u2019, \u2018hummingbird/rodent\u2019 and \u2018flowerpiercer/rodent\u2019) into separate functional groups (hummingbirds, flowerpiercers, bats and rodents) based on differences in timing of activity (diurnal/nocturnal), means of localizing flowers (visual/scent/echolocation), foraging behaviour (hovering/perching), morphological fit with flowers (tubular/bowl\u2010shaped flowers) and nectar preferences (sucroses/hexoses). However, our RF and disparity analyses did not support syndromes related to any individual pollinator group or did not separate syndromes related to the different mixed pollinator assemblages. On the contrary, our results underscore that these pollinator groups are part of the same \u2018functional group\u2019 based on their shared interest in the nectar reward and their ability to cause pollen release via the \u2018salt\u2010shaker\u2019 mechanism. Indeed, the \u2018mixed\u2010vertebrate\u2019 syndrome in Merianieae could encompass different cases of specialized bimodal pollination systems, which are systems representing intermediate adaptations to two different (equally effective) functional pollinator groups (Manning & Goldblatt, 2005). Mixed pollinator assemblages can also be the result of retaining ancestral pollinators whilst being specialized on a more effective primary pollinator (Rosas\u2010Guerrero et al., 2014). In bird syndromes, ancestral bee pollinators are disproportionately common, as well as ancestral bird pollinators in bat syndromes (e.g. Buzato et al., 1994; Wilson et al., 2007; Tripp & Manos, 2008). In Merianieae, bees have not been observed as pollinators in either the \u2018mixed\u2010vertebrate\u2019 or the \u2018passerine\u2019 syndrome. The \u2018mixed\u2010vertebrate\u2019 syndrome, however, could potentially represent a transition stage between ancestral bird and novel bat/rodent pollination, or vice versa. Alternatively, pollinator shifts in Merianieae could have passed directly from a buzz\u2010bee system to the different combinations of vertebrate pollinators. A salient feature of all Merianieae with a \u2018mixed\u2010vertebrate\u2019 syndrome is that they all combine a diurnal with a nocturnal pollinator. We hypothesize that such a \u201824/7 access\u2019 to pollinators may be an important adaptive advantage that could have driven these pollinator shifts in Merianieae with Andean distribution (Varassin et al., 2008). A few other systems employing hummingbirds and bats as pollinators are known from Neotropical cloud forests (e.g. Aphelandra (Acanthaceae), Muchhala et al., 2009; Encholirium (Bromeliaceae), Queiroz et al., 2016), and the combination of these pollinators has been interpreted as a pollination assurance mechanism under harsh montane weather conditions. However, the diversity of combinations of different functional groups in Merianieae is unparalleled in other families. More detailed studies on the population level of species belonging to the \u2018mixed\u2010vertebrate\u2019 syndrome may allow the testing of the hypotheses outlined above and may shed light on the evolutionary history of pollinator shifts in Merianieae.",

            "text": "Experimental studies show that selection, and hence pollination syndrome evolution, operates on complex trait combinations, which do not always match \u2018classical\u2019 syndromes in all traits. Instead, they may represent clade\u2010specific syndromes, which are possibly phylogenetically constrained (Smith & Rausher, 2008; Fenster et al., 2015; O'Meara et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2017). Buzz\u2010bee pollination in Merianieae represents a highly specialized pollination system in itself (Buchmann, 1983). It is possible that the ancestral \u2018buzz\u2019 morphology in Merianieae, with relatively open corollas and poricidal anthers, partly prevented the evolution of the group towards derived \u2018classical\u2019 syndromes, which have not originated from buzz\u2010pollinated flowers. Compared with other systems, access to flowers is not physically restricted by the corolla in Merianieae (e.g. no narrow corolla tubes typical of the classical hummingbird syndrome), and nectar rewards can be retrieved by a variety of pollinators. In pollen\u2010rewarding Merianieae, however, poricidal anthers strictly confine access to the reward to bees capable of buzzing. Poricidal anthers were retained in all Merianieae species, which could be due to an anatomical constraint (lack of endothecium) hindering the evolution of longitudinal anther dehiscence (Keijzer, 1987). Interestingly, in the Melastomataceae genus Miconia, this constraint was apparently overcome as longitudinal anther dehiscence has evolved at least three times (Goldenberg et al., 2003) and has resulted in pollination by non\u2010buzzing insects (Brito et al., 2017). Conserving the poricidal anther morphology whilst shifting to non\u2010buzzing pollinators in Merianieae, however, made the evolution of alternative pollen expulsion mechanisms a necessity. It is thus not surprising that the pollen expulsion mechanism was the most important floral trait separating the three pollination syndromes in Merianieae, with buzzing in the \u2018buzz\u2010bee\u2019 syndrome, the \u2018salt\u2010shaker\u2019 mechanism in the \u2018mixed\u2010vertebrate\u2019 syndrome and the \u2018bellows\u2019 mechanism in the \u2018passerine\u2019 syndrome. The complex functioning of these two new mechanisms was achieved by considerable morphological modifications in the androecium (Fig. 2b). In the \u2018mixed\u2010vertebrate\u2019 syndrome, stamens have deflexed so that pores point towards the opening of the pendant corolla, the location of the thecae has changed from dorsal to lateral, and thecal walls have softened in most species so that pollen is easily released when external pressure is applied (e.g. by a hummingbird's bill). Together, these changes promote the \u2018salt\u2010shaker\u2019\u2010like release of pollen. In the \u2018passerine\u2019 syndrome, stamen appendages have been modified into inflated bulbous \u2018bellows\u2019 organs which cause pollen ejection from thecae when seized by the foraging passerines (Dellinger et al., 2014).",

            "text": "In addition to promoting pollen dispersal, the androecium provides the reward in all three syndromes: pollen in the \u2018buzz\u2010bee\u2019 syndrome, nectar in the \u2018mixed\u2010vertebrate\u2019 syndrome, which is secreted from staminal filament ruptures, and sucrose\u2010rich food bodies in the \u2018passerine\u2019 syndrome, which are formed by the bulbous stamen appendages (Dellinger et al., 2014). This androecium\u2013reward association in Merianieae is particularly important when compared with rewarding structures across angiosperms: both staminal food bodies and nectar release by stamens are otherwise rare. Staminal food bodies are mainly associated with beetle pollination (e.g. Cyclanthaceae, Bernhard, 1996; Calycanthaceae, Gottsberger, 2015) and staminal nectar release usually occurs by specialized nectaries at the filament base, but not by ruptures along filaments as in Merianieae (staminal nectar release has been reported in Laurales, Magnoliales, Caryophyllales and Geraniales; Bernardello, 2007). In addition to the pollen transfer and rewarding function of the androecium, stamen appendages in buzz\u2010bee\u2010pollinated species form strong colour contrasts with the corolla and therefore also carry an advertisement function. This function has been retained in the \u2018passerine\u2019 syndrome, where bulbous appendages also contrast against petals, and partially in the \u2018mixed\u2010vertebrate\u2019 syndrome (in some species (Fig. 3, flower 14), appendages form the contrast; in others, entire stamens (Fig. 3, flowers 10, 11 and 13) or there is no contrast (Fig. 3, flower 12)). Thus, the androecial multifunctionality of the buzz syndrome has been almost completely retained throughout pollinator shifts in Merianieae and both the complex pollen expulsion mechanisms and unusual rewarding structures are the result of the evolutionary starting point (buzz\u2010pollination syndrome). The strong effect of such evolutionary starting points (genetic context) on adaptation (evolutionary outcome) as a source of trait diversity was recognized by Darwin (Darwin, 1859; Armbruster, 2002).",

            "text": "Merianieae pollination syndromes differed markedly in their levels of floral disparity, with the \u2018buzz\u2010bee\u2019 syndrome clearly being most variable, occupying three distinct areas of morphospace. This is in line with previous studies describing buzz\u2010pollinated Melastomataceae as \u2018wandering on an adaptive peak\u2019 (Macior, 1971; Reginato & Michelangeli, 2016). Apparently, the evolutionarily successful buzz\u2010pollination system does not strictly constrain the floral phenotype, but can be achieved by a variety of floral constructions, united by a common reward type (pollen) and pollen expulsion mechanism (buzzing). This, in turn, broadens the exploitable buzz\u2010bee pollinator niche. A typical buzz syndrome flower is often associated with the architecture of the \u2018Solanum\u2010type\u2019 flower (Buchmann, 1983; de Luca & Vallejo\u2010Mar\u00edn, 2013), a small, polysymmetric, pendant flower with reflexed petals and anthers forming a cone on which the bees crouch for buzzing. In the Merianieae species studied here, this phenotype is only realized by a part of the species (buzz\u2010bee group 1, Fig. 3, flower 4). All other buzz\u2010pollinated Merianieae have relatively large flowers with a polysymmetric perianth, but a distinctly monosymmetric androecium. Similar buzz\u2010pollinated flowers are present in the genus Senna (Fabaceae, Marazzi & Endress, 2008; Amorim et al., 2017). Although Senna flowers are usually urceolate with pronounced heteranthery (Buchmann, 1983; Marazzi et al., 2007), this character combination is found only in buzz\u2010bee group 2 (Fig. 3, flower 5). In comparison with the \u2018buzz\u2010bee\u2019 syndrome, the \u2018mixed\u2010vertebrate\u2019 and \u2018passerine\u2019 syndromes show much lower levels of disparity. Apparently, migration from the \u2018buzz\u2010bee plateau\u2019 happened along two relatively narrow ridges in combination with a change in reward type, pollen expulsion mechanism, corolla shape and androecial arrangement. Although not yet formally tested, this seems to be in line with pollinator shifts reported for the three other Neotropical Melastomataceae tribes (Blakeeae, Melastomateae, Miconieae, e.g. Goldenberg et al., 2008; Varassin et al., 2008; Penneys & Judd, 2011). As in Merianieae, the vast majority of species in the rest of Melastomataceae are buzz\u2010bee\u2010pollinated (c. 89%, Renner, 1989) and show a tremendous diversity of floral morphologies.

We demonstrate that the highly specialized buzz\u2010pollination syndrome largely channelled the evolution of alternative pollination systems, and that the multi\u2010functionality of the androecium (pollen expulsion, reward, attraction) was retained throughout pollinator shifts. Our results further emphasize the value and validity of the pollination syndrome concept, but, at the same time, point out that pollination syndromes need to be evaluated carefully in each study group.",
