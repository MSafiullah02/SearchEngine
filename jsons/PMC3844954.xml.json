            "text": "Type III interferon or interferon lambda (IFN\u03bb) is a recently discovered group of interferons (Dumoutier et al, 2003; Kotenko et al, 2003; Sheppard et al, 2003). Although IFN\u03bbs are clearly interferons (Ank et al, 2006; Doyle et al, 2006; Zhou et al, 2007), they signal via a complex consisting of the IFN\u03bbR1 and IL-10R2 receptor chains and share both structural features and the IL-10R2 chain with the IL-10 family of cytokines (Gad et al, 2009). Type III interferons distinguish themselves in being highly tissue specific. The IFN\u03bbR1 receptor chain is expressed on cells of epithelial origin and a yet not clearly defined small subset of haematopoietic cells (Mennechet and Uze, 2006; Mordstein et al, 2010; Pott et al, 2011). The liver is of particular interest to this report. In humans, hepatocytes express IFN\u03bbR1, and thus respond to IFN\u03bb (Dickensheets et al, 2013; Wang et al, 2013). Humans possess four IFN\u03bb genes (IFNL1, -L2, -L3 and -L4) as well as a pseudogene (IFNL3P1) (Lasfar et al, 2006; Fox et al, 2009). Whereas the IFNL1, -L2 and -L3 genes were described in 2003 (Kotenko et al, 2003; Sheppard et al, 2003), the IFNL4 gene was described recently and the IFNL4 gene has been inactivated in large part of the human population by a frameshift mutation (Prokunina-Olsson et al, 2013). Phase 2 of clinical trials using pegylated IFN\u03bb1 against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has recently been completed (Ramos, 2010), and it has now entered the phase 3 trials. IFN\u03bbs are interesting pharmaceuticals, as the rather specific expression pattern of the IFN\u03bbR1 receptor should reduce the adverse effects compared to the type I IFN treatment.",

Rather unexpectedly, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within and around the IFN\u03bb3 gene were discovered as powerful predictors of treatment outcome as well as the likelihood for spontaneous clearance of the virus (Ge et al, 2009; Thomas et al, 2009). Extensive studies of the genetic region around the IFNL3 gene revealed the existence of a novel gene, the IFNL4 gene, which harbours a dinucleotide variant (ss469415590, TT or \u0394G), where the TT allele leads to a frameshift thus inactivating the gene, and the \u0394G allele results in a functional IFNL4 gene (Prokunina-Olsson et al, 2013). In humans, the TT allele is strongly positively associated with HCV clearance as well as with positive treatment outcome (Bibert et al, 2013; Prokunina-Olsson et al, 2013). Thus, disruption of the IFNL4 gene is beneficial for humans in the context of HCV infection, though the reason for this remains unclear.",

In addition, the authors produced recombinant IFN\u03bb4 inactive protein using insect cells. However, this protein was purified from cell lysates and not from the media as it is normally done with secreted proteins, and it appears likely that the protein was not properly folded. The lack of IFN\u03bb4 secretion together with the clear observation of intracellular IFN\u03bb4 protein led to the suggestion that IFN\u03bb4 could signal via an intracellular receptor (Booth and George, 2013; Lupberger et al, 2013; Ray, 2013). Furthermore, the sequence of IFN\u03bb4 is similar to other IFN\u03bbs within the first and last helices, which bind IFN\u03bbR1, while the IL-10R2 binding region is poorly conserved. Thus, the authors questioned whether IFN\u03bb4 actually signals through IL-10R2.",

Furthermore, we show that IFN\u03bb4 has antiviral activity in human hepatocytes against HCV and in primary human airway epithelia (HAE) cells against human coronavirus strain 229E (HCoV-229E) as well as the novel coronavirus MERS-CoV. We demonstrated that IFN\u03bb4 gets secreted from mammalian cells, but with a substantially lower efficiency than what is seen for IFN\u03bb3. Our data suggest that the poor secretion of IFN\u03bb4 is not just a consequence of the weak IFN\u03bb4 SP, but it might be connected with the glycosylation of IFN\u03bb4.",

IFN\u03bb4 was eluted from the size-exclusion chromatography column at \u223c75 ml, consistent with the expected monomeric size of IFN\u03bb4. The purified protein has a size of 17 kDa (Figure 1C) corresponding to IFN\u03bb4 without the SP (residues 23\u2013179 of IFN\u03bb4) (NCBI accession code AFQ38559).",

These cells express low levels of IFN\u03bbR1 and normally respond very poorly to type III interferon (Meager et al, 2005). They do, however, express IL-10R2. In our assay, we introduced a luciferase reporter under the control of the Mx1 promoter in order to measure the interferon activity, and at the same time, we introduced IFN\u03bbR1 by transfection and/or knocked down IL-10R2, using specific siRNA (Figure 2C). The expression of IFN\u03bbR1 by transfection renders them highly responsive to both IFN\u03bb4 and IFN\u03bb3. However, this signal is largely lost when IL-10R2 is knocked down using siRNA (Figure 2C). The IFN\u03b1-mediated signalling was not significantly affected by either overexpression of IFN\u03bbR1 or knock-down of IL-10R2. To confirm these results, we repeated the experiment now blocking IL-10R2 with a specific antibody which has previously been shown to block IL-10R2 signalling in relation to IFN\u03bb (Sheppard et al, 2003). The IL-10R2 antibody did not result in any activation of the reporter gene on its own, but both IFN\u03bb3 and IFN\u03bb4 signalling were sensitive to the IL-10R2 antibody, whereas IFN\u03b1 signalling was unaffected. These results conclusively demonstrate that IFN\u03bb4, like the other members of the type III interferon family, signals via a heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of IFN\u03bbR1 and IL-10R2.",

The overall structure of homIFN\u03bb4 is similar to that of IFN\u03bb3 (Figure 3C), as is expected for a homology model. The following observations validate the accuracy of the model. Cys76 and Cys178, which are not present in IFN\u03bb3, are in close proximity in homIFN\u03bb4, and with minor local rearrangements, they could form a disulphide bridge (Figure 3B). Furthermore, two conserved disulphide links are expected to exist in IFN\u03bb4, connecting Cys27 to Cys122 and Cys62 to Cys152. In both cases, homIFN\u03bb4 is compatible with the formation of these disulphide links.

Yet our data clearly show that both IFN\u03bb3 and IFN\u03bb4 use IFN\u03bbR1 and IL-10R2 for signalling. The model of IFN\u03bb4 suggests a conservation of the helical structure and the way this is presented to IL-10R2. The conserved residues in helix D are primarily hydrophobic residues, which dock helix D to the rest of the structure and thus, determine the steric conformation of this helix. This conservation is most likely crucial for the activation as both receptor chains need to be engaged simultaneously. It is, however, important to remember that IL-10R2 is a shared chain that is capable of binding several different cytokines (IL-10, IL-22 and IL-26 and the IFN\u03bbs). The chain is thus, promiscuous, allowing itself to interact with different ligands (Logsdon et al, 2012).",

Figure 3E shows that the overall structure of homIFN\u03bb4 is very similar to IFN\u03bb1 in the receptor-bound conformation and there are thus no obvious reasons why IFN\u03bb4 would not bind IFN\u03bbR1. The glycosylation site N61 in IFN\u03bb4 is equivalent to W47 in IFN\u03bb1. W47 interacts weakly with IFN\u03bbR1, but is located at the periphery of the interaction site away from the membrane and is situated in a loop between the A- and B-helixes (Miknis et al, 2010).

As can be seen on the right in Figure 6A, treatment with PNGase F resulted in a single band at 18\u201319 kDa, showing that IFN\u03bb4 gets glycosylated.",

This resulted in a clear signal from both IFN\u03bb3 and IFN\u03bb4, which was dependent upon IFN\u03bbR1 (Figure 6B). In order to estimate how much IFN\u03bb4 is secreted, we titrated the supernatants from IFN\u03bb3- and IFN\u03bb4-transfected cells (Figure 6C), and here we observed a substantially lower activity in the supernatant from IFN\u03bb4-transfected cells as compared to IFN\u03bb3-transfected cells (5- to 6-fold difference in EC50 values). Thus, IFN\u03bb4 is secreted at substantially lower levels. Swapping the SPs made no difference for IFN\u03bb3, which was equally well produced with its own or the SP of IFN\u03bb4. In the case of IFN\u03bb4, adding the SP of IFN\u03bb3 lead to lower levels of secreted interferon activity.",

Thus, we wanted to address the glycosylation state of the secreted IFN\u03bb4. As IFN\u03bb4 levels were too low to be detected using standard western blotting, we first refined the detection of IFN\u03bb4 in the media of transfected cells using acetone precipitation (Figure 7A). The western blot revealed IFN\u03bb4 of a size consistent with glycosylation, and this result was confirmed with PNGase F treatment. Next, we made a mutant of IFN\u03bb4 where the glycosylated asparagine residue N61 was mutated to aspartate (IFN\u03bb4 N61D). HEK293 cells were transfected with empty vector, IFN\u03bb4, IFN\u03bb3 or IFN\u03bb4 N61D, and the intracellular and extracellular fractions were analysed by western blotting (Figure 7B). IFN\u03bb4 N61D only gives one band on the western blot of the intracellular fractions corresponding to the unmodified IFN\u03bb4. Neither IFN\u03bb4 nor IFN\u03bb4 N61D is detectable in the extracellular fraction by standard western blotting. However, when we carry out acetone precipitation on the media before western blotting, we see a clear band for IFN\u03bb4, but not for IFN\u03bb4 N61D, showing that this mutation further impairs the secretion of IFN\u03bb4. This is also reflected in the IFN\u03bb activity (performed as in Figure 6C), where the activity in the supernatant of cells transfected with IFN\u03bb4 N61D is greatly decreased compared to that from cells transfected with IFN\u03bb4 (Figure 7C).",

However, the question arose whether the glycosylated IFN\u03bb4 is active or whether low levels of unglycosylated protein that is undetectable by western blotting even after acetone precipitation mediate the activity. To exclude that non-glycosylated IFN\u03bb4 could be the source of the interferon activity, we incubated media from IFN\u03bb4-transfected cells with Concanavalin A (Con A) beads. Con A is a lectin that binds terminal \u03b1-D mannose and \u03b1-D glucose found on high mannose and hybrid N-linked glycans. Media from cells transfected with IFN\u03bb4 or empty vector were incubated with Con A beads. In the IFN\u03bb4-transfected cells, there was interferon activity in the input before addition of the Con A beads and this activity was removed after incubation with the beads (Figure 7E). This shows that the glycosylated IFN\u03bb4 is the source of the measured interferon activity. We attempted to elute IFN\u03bb4 from the beads using standard elution buffer but without success, as seen by the lack of activity (Figure 7D) and protein (Figure 7E) in the eluate. Nevertheless, we were able to confirm that IFN\u03bb4 was bound to the Con A beads by boiling these beads in SDS page buffer and performing a western blotting (Figure 7E).",

First, we confirmed the use of the IFN\u03bbR1 receptor chain by IFN\u03bb4, as IFN\u03bb4 signalling was restored in HEK293 cells upon transfection with IFN\u03bbR1. Next, we demonstrated the involvement of IL-10R2 both by siRNA knockdown and by blocking the IL-10R2 chain by a specific antibody that has been used to define the receptor usage of the other IFN\u03bbs (Sheppard et al, 2003). Thus, IFN\u03bb4 leads to the activation of an interferon response and mediates antiviral effects through the canonical IFN\u03bb receptor complex composed of IFN\u03bbR1 and IL-10R2. However, these results do not exclude the possibility that IFN\u03bb4 can signal through other types of cytokine receptors, but it would indicate that if such a signalling existed it would not involve the regulation of classical ISGs.",

To our surprise, the antiviral activity of IFN\u03bb3 and IFN\u03bb4, respectively, was indistinguishable in all viral infection models tested. For HCV, we tested two different hepatic cell lines, Huh7 and HepG2, and in neither case did we observe any difference between IFN\u03bb3 and IFN\u03bb4. Likewise, using primary HAE cells for the infection with either HCoV-229E or MERS-CoV, we did not observe any difference between IFN\u03bb3 and IFN\u03bb4. This is remarkable as the sequence identity between the two isoforms is only 29% (Prokunina-Olsson et al, 2013), and our preliminary bioinformatics studies reveal that the protein sequence of IFN\u03bb4 is well conserved among mammals (data not shown). Thus, there must have been an evolutionary pressure to keep IFN\u03bb4 as a functional protein throughout the mammalian evolution until the sudden introduction of a frameshift mutation in humans. Since the inactivation of the IFNL4 gene is strongly correlated with increased likelihood of spontaneous clearance of HCV as well as with a positive response to the treatment with type I IFN, it appears that the production of IFN\u03bb4 protein is actually a disadvantage during HCV infection. Furthermore, there appears to be a positive selection in humans for the frameshift mutation abolishing IFN\u03bb4 production (Prokunina-Olsson et al, 2013). Whether this selection is solely driven by HCV is currently not known. IFN\u03bb4 production could even be beneficial in the context of other viral infections. It was thus recently reported that the SNPs that have been shown to be favourable for the treatment outcome as well as the likelihood for spontaneous clearance of HCV are associated with poor recovery from hepatitis B virus infection (Kim et al, 2013).",

As discussed above, the induction of ISGs occurs through the canonical IFN\u03bb receptor complex, but we cannot exclude that IFN\u03bb4 has activities outside the induction of ISGs, which could be mediated through an as yet unidentified receptor. However, our data suggests that IFN\u03bb4 is highly active against HCV despite the fact that it has been shown to be a predictor of poor response to HCV. The current data cannot exclude indirect genetic effects, and thus it is not firmly proven that the IFN\u03bb4 protein is the causal agent for the poor prognosis of HCV patients with a functional IFNL4 gene. Furthermore, no evidence for the presence of the IFN\u03bb4 protein in HCV patients exists to date. However, if one assumes that the IFN\u03bb4 protein is the causal agent, this would suggest a complicated relationship between IFN\u03bb4 and HCV in humans, where IFN\u03bb4 somehow impairs a full immune response towards HCV. We have produced fully functional IFN\u03bb4 protein which should be used for further studies of IFN\u03bb4 on hepatic and immune cells. Furthermore, it will be important to address whether HCV is driving the selection of the TT allele (non-functional IFN\u03bb4) in humans, and if the introduction of the TT allele changes susceptibility towards other viral infections.",

The lack of secretion of IFN\u03bb4 led several news and views papers to suggest the presence of an intracellular receptor. Our data clearly demonstrate that IFN\u03bb4 does use the normal receptor situated at the cellular membrane, although we cannot formally exclude the presence of an intracellular receptor. However, we consider it likely that the activation of the interferon pathway, which was observed after transfection of HepG2 cells with IFN\u03bb4 expressing plasmids (Prokunina-Olsson et al, 2013), is due to low levels of secreted IFN\u03bb4.",
