FdUMP is formed in two steps, involving thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and thymidine kinase (TK). Inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TS) by 5FdUMP represents the critical step of 5-FU cytotoxicity. TS catalyses the transformation of dUMP into deoxythymidine 5' monophosphate (dTMP), which is the rate-limiting step of DNA synthesis. TS inhibition depends on the cofactor 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2THF) which forms a ternary complex with 5-FdUMP and TS. \u2022 A defect in the catabolic enzyme DPD, which occurs in its complete form in 0.1% of patients and in its partial form in 3-5% of patients, triggers a life-threatening toxic syndrome encompassing severe myelotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and gastrointestinal toxicity. \u2022 The DPD genotype has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. An allelic inactivation leading to 50% reduction of normal DPD activity is sufficient for the development of 5-FU toxicity. At least 20 mutations have been found in the DPD coding region and promoter. Two mutations with proven clinical relevance are DPYD*2A and DPYD*9A. DPYD*2A is a splice site mutation resulting in the production of shortened mRNA. DPYD*9A is a common missense T85C mutation in exon 2, leading to a C29R amino acid exchange. Correlation between the two mutations and the clinical phenotype together with other SNPs in enzymes of the 5-FU metabolism should yield improved prediction of 5-FU-associated toxicity.",
