Unlike SARS or MERS, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 also developed intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea. Other typical signs include fever, dry cough, and dyspnea.

By January 30, 2020, there were 7734 cases confirmed in China and 90 others confirmed worldwide, including countries in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, the United States (US), and in Europe.6 Also, on this date the US first reported a case of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Currently, there is no vaccine or specific therapy for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Treatments based on anecdotal evidence and preliminary clinical trials include the antivirals lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir and tocilizumab and the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents, tocilizumab, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine.7 Currently, remdesivir holds the most promise for treatment. By inhibiting viral RNA synthesis, it has been demonstrated to reduce the viral load and to prevent the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.8\n",

In an attempt to protect the anesthesia, surgical, and intraoperative personnel from contracting SARS-CoV-2 while providing care to these patients, consensus guidelines were developed by the Difficult Airway Society, the Association of Anaesthetists, the Intensive Care Society, the Faculty of Intensive Medicine, and the Royal College of Anaesthetists for the management of the airway in patients with SARS-CoV-2.9 Building upon those recommendations, the EACTA Thoracic Subspecialty Committee has created preliminary recommendations using expert opinions that reviewed the clinical experience in patients with MERS-CoV and COVID-19 undergoing thoracic surgery, a literature search on the management of patients with MER-CoV, COVID-19, SARS, and H1N1, including consensus recommendations, guidelines, randomized controlled trials, reviews, and observational and cases series, and through a limited survey of members of the subcommittee.2 These recommendations focus on the preparation for anesthesia, airway management, OLV, ventilation, and extubation.",

            "text": "The goals of these recommendations are to emphasize efficient airway control and to establish controlled ventilation without compromising the patient while providing maximal protection to the health care team. Tracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients is a high-risk procedure because of aerosol transmission during tracheal intubation either with a double lumen tube (DLT) or endotracheal tube (ETT) with a bronchial blocker (BB), as well as during bronchoscopy to evaluate and manage the device. Intubation is also a risk for patients with severe lung disease due to COVID-19, who may not tolerate prolonged periods of apnea.2 The authors developed a mnemonic \u201cSAS\u201d, meaning that the procedure should be \u201cS\u201dafe for the staff and patient, \u201cA\u201dccurate, and \u201cSwift\u201d. Since patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be asymptomatic, it is suggested that every patient be viewed as potentially viewed infectious. Other recommendations are that elective intubations are preferable over emergency intubations, that the intubation should occur in a negative pressure room with >12 air changes/minute, the level of personal protection equipment (PPE) should include a respiratory type mask and face shield or helmet and if the OR does not have a negative pressure room, the intubation should be performed in a negative pressure room followed by transfer to the OR. In a positive pressure room, the room should be placed under the least possible positive pressure with the door closed with the rest of the OR under higher positive pressure to limit the dispersion of aerosols. The intubating team should be limited to those with essential roles and should be the most experienced providers, one to manage the airway and the other to administer medications and to assist. Those not required for airway management should be outside of the room until the airway is secured. The operating room and immediate area are divided into 3 zones, the red zone, where the actual procedure takes place, a yellow zone, located outside of the operating room, where a physician with full PPE is available if help is required, and a white zone, outside of the OR, where an observer can monitor the donning and doffing of PPE. The authors also suggest different levels of PPE depending on the level of exposure. Procedures defined as having an increased risk of infection are the most aerosol generating procedures, such as intubation and bronchoscopy. During these procedures, the authors suggest the use of airborne level precautions including hair covers/hoods, a fitted filtering facepiece or N95 mask, goggles or face shield, long sleeve fluid resistant gowns, double gloves, and shoe covers, with a specific sequence for donning and doffing the PPE to avoid the spread of infection.",

            "text": "In preparation for intubation, it is recommended that a stand be set up with single use blades, laryngoscopes, video laryngoscopes, and flexible bronchoscopes, a closed system for suction, endotracheal tubes (ETT) and devices for OLV, including BBs and DLTs. An antiviral filter should be attached to the expiratory limb of the circuit. Patient position should be optimized before intubation and the patient adequately preoxygenated to prevent or reduce the need for mask ventilation. If face mask ventilation is required, a 2-person, low flow, low pressure technique should be used, with a 2 handed grip on the face mask to improve seal. A rapid sequence induction should be performed. Intubation should be performed using videolaryngoscopy with a single use blade and remote screen to minimize or avoid airborne spread of aerosolized secretions. The suggested algorithm for an unanticipated difficult intubation includes laryngoscopy with an ETT with a stylet, and if that attempt fails, oxygenation should be performed using a low tidal volume/low pressure technique. If the second attempt at laryngoscopy fails, the use of a second generation intubating supraglottic airway device should be considered with intubation through this device using fiberoptic bronchoscopy and a remote screen. The ETT cuff or tracheal cuff of the DLT should be inflated to seal the airway before initiating ventilation and the cuff pressure should be at least 5-10 cm H2O above maximal airway pressure to minimize the risks for aerosol spread. The choice of device used for OLV varies on the indication, the difficulty of intubation, the length of the procedure, and whether postoperative ventilation is required. BBs are recommended for patients where separation is required, for shorter procedures, and in patients with a potentially difficult airway, for those who arrive to the OR intubated, or when postoperative ventilation is anticipated. DLTs are indicated for patients where lung isolation and suctioning are required or the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is anticipated. If available, a DLT with an embedded camera can minimize the requirement for a bronchoscope and avoid opening the airway. For airway manipulations such bronchoscopy or airway suctioning, it is suggested that an ET-tube swivel connector with a valve that prevents leakage from the airway be used. Before opening the valve to introduce the bronchoscope or suction catheter, the anesthesia ventilator should be paused and the procedure performed under apnea.",

A closed suction catheter with an infraglottic tip should be attached to the circuit to be used for suctioning.

After tracheal intubation, disposable equipment should be discarded, reusable equipment should be placed inside sheaths and decontaminated, and if the intubation room is separate from the OD, doffing of PPE should be performed and monitored by an observer. The room should be empty for 20 minutes before cleaning to allow aerosols to settle. In the OR, PPE should be worn until the end of the procedure, after immediately changing the outer gloves. Hand hygiene must be performed before and after all patient contact and the risks of aerosol transmission with coughing and the need for reintubation should be weighed before attempting to extubate the patient.10\n,\n11\n",

A PEEP of 13-15 cm H2O may be required.2 A PEEP titration can be used to determine the optimum PEEP and if lung compliance is not affected, an alveolar recruitment maneuver may be helpful. The application of PEEP and/or recruitment maneuvers should be used with caution because they may impair hemodynamic stability. Oxygenation should not be compromised during procedures that do not require isolation. The authors suggest the use of CPAP to the non-dependent lung to prevent hypoxia where the benefits of oxygenation outweigh the possibility of aerosolization from the CPAP system.",
