Domestic buffaloes in Asia are of two types: the swamp type for draught in the eastern half of Asia and the river type for milk in the western half of Asia (see\nDAIRY ANIMALS | Water Buffalo). Once a sadly neglected farm species, the river type buffalo currently produces about 55 million tonnes of milk annually from some of the world's best buffalo breeds in India and Pakistan. They breed throughout the year, conceive at 250\u2013275 kg body weight, calve for the first time at 3\u20135 years following a gestation period of 305\u2013320 days, and produce two calves every 3 years. Lactating animals are fed mainly on straw, crop residues and mineral supplements such as urea\u2013molasses\u2013mineral block (UMMB). In most rural areas, animals are hand-milked twice daily with the calf present to stimulate milk letdown. Lactation is 200\u2013300 days with first lactation milk yields of 1500\u20131800 kg. Breeding females are retained in the herd until about the ninth lactation (16 years of age) with reasonable economic returns. River buffaloes are vulnerable to most infectious and metabolic diseases affecting cattle. In India and Pakistan, milk is marketed through a network of milk cooperatives, which guarantee a stable price throughout the year for the farmer. Buffalo milk contains twice as much butterfat as cows' milk. Besides ghee, several other products are manufactured from buffalo milk, such as butter, cheese, full cream milk powder, skim milk powder and infant formulae. Thus, the domestic buffalo is emerging as an alternative source for the manufacture of dairy products worldwide.",
