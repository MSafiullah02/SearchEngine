            "text": "This manuscript aims to examine the phylogenetic and host determinants of viral sharing between mammals. This is an interesting and well-written manuscript that should appeal to the readership of Nature Communications. The results aren't particularly surprising or novel in respect to what is known about parasite sharing, but I think that the approach is quite interesting (whilst I do have a few concerns below) and dataset robust. In particular, the authors should be congratulated on testing their predictions using a separate dataset -this is rarely done. In general, the prediction part of this manuscript is really well done. I do have a few concerns, however on other parts of this ms. Mainly, the use of GAMMs on essentially a collection of distance matrices seems far from optimal. Given that the 'species effect' was so strong (51% of the explained deviance), using an approach that accounts naturally for these dependencies, such as a Markov Random Fields or Generalized Dissimilarity Models (or a myriad of related approaches) seems warranted (see Clark and Clegg, 2017) . Then the viral count data could be included and the resultant matrix could be turned into (dis)similarity matrix and transformed appropriately to account for the skew the authors mention. Losing the count data seems like an avoidable loss. At a minimum, I think more explanation is needed regarding multi-membership random effects -I had to do some research to find out how they worked. As they are quite rarely used in ecology, I think a sentence or two to give a brief overview would help.",

We have carefully considered his suggestion to use alternative modelling approaches to improve our mammalian viral sharing network. Dr Fountain-Jones' main reason for suggesting GDMs is the ability to control for sampling bias. He additionally points out that using count data for viral sharing events would provide more information. We indeed originally included GDM's in our list of potential approaches when we first considered the question and began this research. While we realise that our approach is not especially common -although not unprecedented -in network studies, we have opted to retain our use of GAMMs and binary data for a variety of reasons that we have taken care to outline in detail below.",

            "text": "\u2022 First, and most importantly, we chose to model the viral sharing network as a binary (rather than weighted, or count-based) network for empirical reasons. We outlined those reasons at lines 617-625 and in our previous response to the reviewers at Nature Ecology and Evolution. Namely, the observed viral sharing network is prohibitively poorly-sampled, and so we aimed to avoid prescribing or predicting the number of viruses shared, particularly because this may influence priorities for viral discovery. As such, the probability of viral sharing alone is a more parsimonious option for the analytical aims of our study. Further, much of the variation in number of known viruses would be highly heterogeneous across species, exacerbating the unevenness of sampling in the data. As such, the choice to model the network as a binary was not a necessity of our general modelling approach, but resulted from consideration of the mechanisms generating variation in viral counts across host species. For these reasons, among others, all references that we cite below (Davies & Pedersen 2008; Huang et al. 2014; Willoughby et al. 2017; Wells et al. 2018 Wells et al. , 2020 Stephens et al. 2019 ) use either binary viral sharing or proportion of shared viruses as a response variable, rather than viral counts.",

            "text": "\u2022 We also have several methodological reasons for choosing GAMMs with multi-membership random effects as our approach of choice. First, GAMMs are more similar to the methods already used for parasite sharing models across and within mammal orders. Our study expands upon previous parasite sharing analyses (Davies & Pedersen 2008; Huang et al. 2014; Willoughby et al. 2017; Wells et al. 2018 Wells et al. , 2020 Stephens et al. 2019) ; their statistical methods included: a generalised linear model (GLM) or similar model with no specialised random effects (Davies & Pedersen 2008; Huang et al. 2014; Willoughby et al. 2017; Wells et al. 2018) , a generalised additive model (GAM) with no specialised random effects (Stephens et al. 2019) , and a hierarchical regression with an order-level random effect (Wells et al. 2020) . However, none of these other studies attempted to use more sophisticated models than GLMs/GAMs. Multi-membership random effects are an established method for controlling for row and column effects in networks analysed using GLM frameworks: for example, (Rushmore et al. 2013 ) used multi-membership random effects to control for individual-level nondirectionality in networks of chimpanzee interactions. As such, our model is functionally similar to prior models but is more conservative and represents a useful extension of the pre-existing viral sharing analysis methodologies. We believe our approach is analytically robust, well-founded, simple to expand upon, and easy to connect to previous analyses, all while tangibly improving on these previous approaches.",

Further, we were then able to simulate a viral sharing network explicitly avoiding this effect. The species-level effect indeed accounted for a large proportion of the deviance explained, as Dr Fountain-Jones points out, but the effect also left a considerable amount of deviance explained by the fixed effects. This is the portion of the model that we used to simulate with, explicitly avoiding the species-level variation, and it would be difficult to do so with another approach, particularly if using count or dissimilarity data. In addition, research effort itself surprisingly had no detectable effect on the probability of sharing, despite the importance of the species-level effect, and we find it unlikely that GDMs would make this easier to interpret, more reliable, or more accurate.",
