As a disease begins to spread in the population, information about the disease is transmitted to others, which in turn has an effect on the spread of disease. In this paper, using empirical results of the propagation of H7N9 and information about the disease, we clearly show that the spreading dynamics of the two-types of processes influence each other. We build a mathematical model in which both types of spreading dynamics are described using the SIS process in order to illustrate the influence of information diffusion on epidemic spreading. Both the simulation results and the pairwise analysis reveal that information diffusion can increase the threshold of an epidemic outbreak, decrease the final fraction of infected individuals and significantly decrease the rate at which the epidemic propagates. Additionally, we find that the multi-outbreak phenomena of epidemic spreading, along with the impact of information diffusion, is consistent with the empirical results. These findings highlight the requirement to maintain social awareness of diseases even when the epidemics seem to be under control in order to prevent a subsequent outbreak. These results may shed light on the in-depth understanding of the interplay between the dynamics of epidemic spreading and information diffusion.",

Epidemic spreading is generally considered to be a dynamic process in which a disease is transmitted from one individual to another through contacts in peer-to-peer networks. To date, a vast amount of research has focused on understanding the epidemic spreading phenomenon, which can be categorized into the following types: (1) epidemic spreading dynamics in various network structures [2] , such as a scale-free network [3, 4] , a small-world network [5, 6] and an interdependent network [7, 8] ; (2) propagation mechanisms that describe the epidemic spreading process, such as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model for influenza [9, 10] , the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model for sexually transmitted disease [11, 12] and the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model for rabies [13, 14] ; (3) data-driven modeling approaches that tackle the epidemic transmission [15] by analyzing the available real datasets, such as the scaling laws in human mobility [16, 17] , individual interactions [18, 19] , and contact patterns [20, 21] .",

These preventive behavioral responses upon receiving information regarding the disease may reduce the size of the epidemic outbreak. This is supported by research that has shown that people's behavioral responses contribute to the control of disease spreading, an example of which that is evident in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003 [23] . Therefore, there has been an increased interest in examining the interaction between epidemic spreading and information diffusion. Seminal study was conducted in order to understand how the diffusion of awareness, or disease information, affects the spread of diseases. This was done by building a model in which the spread of both the disease and information in a host population was accounted for [24] [25] [26] [27] . The results indicated that the interaction between these two different processes of spreading decreased the size of the epidemic outbreak in a well-mixed population [24] . In some cases, enough behavioral changes would occur in response to the diffusion of disease information that the growing epidemic would vanish completely, this occurred even in cases where the epidemic transmission rate was higher than the classical threshold [28, 29] . Additionally, the interplay between information diffusion and epidemic spreading was elucidated on multiplex networks, where each type of spreading dynamics occurs on its own layer (information diffusion on communication layer versus epidemic spreading on physical layer) [30] [31] [32] . The epidemic threshold as it relates to the physical contact layer can be increased by enhancing the diffusion rate of information on the communication layer. The effect that behavioral changes have on a population can be 3 explained as being affected by the following three characteristics [26] : (i) the disease state of the individuals, such as vaccination [33, 34] ; (ii) the epidemic transmission rate and recovery rate [30, 35] ; (iii) the contact network structure, such as the adaptive process [36] [37] [38] . Mass communication scholars share similar views on the causal linkages between the spread of epidemics and the diffusion of information regarding the epidemics. For example, the outbreak of severe epidemics usually attracts heavy media coverage, subsequently resulting in the following three types of responses from the public: cognitive responses, such as the attention to the information and an increased awareness of the problem [50], affective responses, such as anxiety, fear, or even panic [51] , and behavioral responses, such as the adoption of new practices in order to replace undesirable habits [52] . However, these are more assumptions than empirical facts because it is difficult to find relevant data for such a clear-cut process and, even when the data are available, it is difficult to separate the unique effects of information on the control of epidemics from other confounding factors, such as changes in the diseases, the seasons and the medical treatments.",

The occurrence of a disease prompts the sharing of information regarding the disease, which leads to preventive measures that inhibit epidemic spreading [24, 32] . Studies have also indicated that when an outbreak is under control people are less vigilant in sharing relevant information which leads to a decrease in preventative measures and may result in a recurrence of pandemic epidemics. Unfortunately, evidence suggests that the second outbreak of epidemics is typically more deadly. For example, the spread of SARS was shown to be alleviated in early March 2003, however, later that month showed a rapid increase, as indicated in the evolution curve of the probable cases of SARS ( Fig. 2 in Ref. [23] ). This rapid increase may be directly related to the time in which people's attention became more focused on the Iraq War in 2003. This is the central issue that is addressed in the current study. First, we demonstrate a similar outbreak pattern using data on the spread of avian influenza A (H7N9) in China [39] [40] [41] along with the diffusion of disease information. Then a mathematical model was built that describes both types of spreading dynamics (i.e., disease and information) as an SIS process. Results using the model show that information diffusion can significantly inhibit epidemic spreading. Finally, simulation results exhibit multi-outbreak phenomena in the epidemic spreading accompanied by the impact of information diffusion, which is consistent with the empirical results. Our findings highlight the need for the maintenance of disease awareness even during times when epidemics appear to be under control. 4 ",

This suggests that the influence of information diffusion on epidemic spreading could be quite significant. Actually, public responses to H7N9, including actions such as staying at home or wearing face masks, can affect the spread of the epidemic. Two epidemic outbreaks occurred during the period under consideration. Interestingly, the size of the first epidemic outbreak (Apr. 2013) was smaller than the second (Feb. 2014), which inversely correlated with the information domain, in which the number of individuals discussing the disease during the first outbreak was much greater than the number of individuals discussing the disease during the second outbreak. This implies that an increased awareness of H7N9 decreased the size of the epidemic outbreak. Research on news diffusion offers an alternative explanation, which suggest that as an epidemic progresses, the uncertainty surrounding it declines and the diffusion of the relevant information also decays [53] . In the current case, it is possible that there was a higher degree of uncertainty among the Chinese people regarding H7N9 when they first heard about it in April 2013, however, they had become accustomed, and thus less anxious and responsive, to H7N9 in February 2014, even when there were more reported cases of infected people.",

A higher prevalence of infected individuals results in the maintenance of more informed individuals for a smaller information fading probability (\u03b4 < 1). This leads to the high informed level in the system, which in turn inhibits the epidemic spreading (\u03c3 {I,S,SI} < 1). This feedback effect can be clearly illustrated in the full set of differential equations based on the classical mean-field analysis [24] (See Eq.(1) in Sec. Method and Materials). Additionally, a full set of differential equations based on the pairwise analysis was obtained [42] [43] [44] that describes the interaction between the two spreading processes (See Eq.(2) in Sec. Method and Materials). Actually, the pairwise analysis is also based on the mean-field assumption for calculating the change of each type of nodes as well as the nodepairs. The simulation results of the infected dynamics, numerical results of classical mean-field analysis and pairwise analysis when \u03b1 = 0.6 and \u03b2 = 0.3 is shown in Fig. 4 . The results of the pairwise model are clearly a better fit to the simulation than the results of classical mean-field analysis.",

This results also indicates that information spreading is not always an effective auxiliary measure in the control of the spread of disease, for example, in the case in which there exists a disease with a strong infectiveness (e.g., large epidemic transmission probability \u03b2 in the red range in Fig. 5 Interestingly, the empirical analysis illustrates that the dynamics of many diseases exhibit a multi-outbreak phenomena [14, [45] [46] [47] , in which there are several waves in the process of epidemic spreading, similar to the dynamics illustrated in Fig. 1 . Generally, there are many complex factors that contribute to multi-outbreaks, including seasonal influence, climatic variation, and incubation period. The periodic outbreaks in the SIS model can be interpreted by the 8 influence of information diffusion. As previously mentioned, there is a mutual feedback between information diffusion and epidemic spreading in the proposed model. On the one hand, a larger proportion of infected individuals should result in an increase in preventive behavioral responses [28] due to the increased awareness of the disease, thus leading to a steady decrease in infected cases over time. On the other hand, when the spread of the disease appears to be under control (e.g., the size of infected population decreases), people become less vigilant, which leads to a decrease in the dissemination of information and increases the chances of a second outbreak. Notably, the size of the second outbreak is often larger than the previous one, as in the case of SARS in 2003 (Fig.2 in Ref. [23] ), Dengue Fever in Taiwan in 2001-2002 (Fig.3A in Ref. [47] ).",

            "text": "In order to illustrate the multi-outbreak phenomena of epidemic spreading with the influence of information diffusion, two critical infected levels were set in this model for simplicity (I high and I low ). When the fraction of infected individuals in the population is larger than the critical value of the high infected level (> I high ), the information spreads more quickly and there is an increase in preventative behavioral responses. Based on this assumption, we obtain simulation results of the dynamic of infected individuals, as shown in Fig. 7 . In this case, we set \u03b2 = 0.18, which is much larger than the epidemic threshold without considering information diffusion. The disease spreads very quickly at first while there are very few people who are aware of the occurrence of the disease. Typically, the diffusion of information regarding a disease occurs at a faster rate than epidemic spreading. Therefore, as the information regarding the disease quickly spreads, the high informed level has a significant effect on inhibiting the spread of the epidemic (the decay period of the epidemic). It should be noted that the epidemic will be completely suppressed if the high informed level can be maintained. However, when the disease is controlled from the first outbreak (i.e., the infected density is smaller than I low ), members of the population are likely to no longer consider the disease as a threat, thus ignoring the disease propagation and no longer actively engaging in protective measures, which will in turn lead to another outbreak of the epidemic, with a high probability of the second being larger than the first. In this model, such changes in behavioral responses can be illustrated by using different parameter settings, such as small \u03b1 and large \u03c3 I and \u03c3 S . This allows for the disease to spread again as long as social awareness becomes low enough, as is shown in the second epidemic outbreak illustrated in Fig. 7 . Similar to the empirical analysis shown in Fig. 1 , the size of the first epidemic outbreak is smaller than that of the second one, whereas the informed level in the first epidemic outbreak is higher than that in the second one. It should be noted that, due to the difficulty in precisely quantifying the informed level in the empirical analysis, the number of tweets that discuss the related disease is used as a proxy measure in Fig. 1 . In contrast to the trend shown in Fig. 1 , the high informed level must be maintained during the period when the infected proportion decreases as shown by the pink curve in Fig. 7 . Based on the model analysis, it could be concluded that it is important to strengthen public awareness of disease occurrence, especially during times in which the spread of the epidemic is under control, otherwise, there is a high probability of a second outbreak.",

In this study, we focus on the inhibition of information diffusion, and preventive behavioral responses are illustrated with some parameters generally.

In order to gain a better understanding of the critical phenomenon, we investigate the evolution of the infection densities for various values of \u03b2 when \u03b1 = 0.6, as shown in Fig. 6. From the differential equations of the standard SIS model, dI dt = \u2212I + \u03b2 k I(1 \u2212 I) (where I = I \u2212 + I + ), we obtain I \u221d t \u22121 at the critical point with integration, which indicates that the infection density has a power-law decay along the time evolution at the critical point. The inset ofFig. 6shows a power-law decay of the infection density when \u03b2 \u2248 0.0444, whereas the infected density (I) tends to be a steady-state value that leads to an endemic state when \u03b2 = 0.05, and rapidly decays to zero leading to a healthy state when \u03b2 = 0.04. Therefore, it can be inferred that the critical value of \u03b2 is approximately 0.0444 in this case, which is consistent with the results shown inFig. 5, where the phase diagram indicates that the critical value of \u03b2 is around 0.045 when \u03b1 = 0.6.",

Both the simulation results and the pairwise analysis reveal that information diffusion can increase the epidemic outbreak threshold, diminish the final fractions of infected individuals and significantly slow down the rate of propagation. More importantly, we address the issue of multi-outbreak phenomena of epidemic spreading with information diffusion as the governing. The results of the simulation suggest that a higher epidemic prevalence impels people to increase in disease information sharing, leading to a high level of informed individuals, which in turn results in the steady decrease in the number of infected cases. During the periods in which the disease appears to be controlled, less attention is given to the disease leading to a decrease in the transmission of information and an increase in the chance of another outbreak. Additionally, the simulation results of the multi-outbreak phenomena were consistent with the empirical analysis.",
