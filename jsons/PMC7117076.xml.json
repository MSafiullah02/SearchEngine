However, the most stringent criteria available have been associated with the greatest observed mortality and establishing the diagnosis of VAP took significantly longer when applying them compared with less stringent criteria, potentially resulting in delayed therapy.\n21\nErring on the side of caution, most clinicians employ the finding of a new or progressive radiographic infiltrate and at least one clinical feature (fever, leukocytosis, worsening oxygenation, or purulent tracheal secretions), which has high sensitivity but low specificity for VAP.\n22\nThe difficulty in relying on clinical criteria for the diagnosis of VAP is the potential for over diagnosis, resulting in the unnecessary administration of antibiotics to noninfected patients. This has the potential to promote further emergence of antibiotic resistance, especially when employed for prolonged time periods, and to dilute out the ability of clinicians to identify the beneficial impact of treating patients with appropriate initial antibiotic therapy.\n23\n24\n",

Results of these procedures guide decisions such as when to initiate or stop antibiotics and which drug should be used against the offending agent. There are no definitive data to support the use of one sampling technique over another; however, the cellular analysis of BAL fluid may provide an advantage, as a sample containing less than 50% neutrophils was associated with excellent negative predictive value in one study.\n26\nAlso, given the multifocal nature of VAP, even mini-BAL samples obtained blindly without the use of bronchoscopy can be effective.\n30\n31\n32\nHowever, other studies caution on the use of unilateral cultures even when directed to the side of the dominant radiographic abnormality.\n33\nThe bacteriologic strategy has resulted in less overall prescription and more narrowed antibiotic use, an important point given the surge of antibiotic resistance in the ICU setting.\n34\n35\n36\nA major disadvantage of the bacteriologic approach is the concern for false negatives which could result in cases of nosocomial pneumonia going untreated, especially in the setting of recently introduced antibiotics.\n37\n",

The high sample throughput with reasonable turnaround time of these assays makes them suitable multiplex platforms for routine screening of respiratory specimens in hospital-based laboratories. Moreover, the use of multiplex real-time PCR has been associated with reduced antibiotic utilization in patients evaluated for respiratory tract infections demonstrating their potential value as antibiotic stewardship adjuncts.\n49\n50\nAnother potential use of multiplex real-time PCR would be the addition of emerging respiratory viral pathogens to the panel, facilitating surveillance to identify patients with new, and often virulent, respiratory virus syndromes such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection.\n51\n",

One patient (3%) was clinically diagnosed with VAP. Of 73 paired samples, conventional culture methods identified seven, containing pneumonia panel bacteria (>10\n4\ncolony-forming units/mL) from five patients (four\nS. aureus\n[three MRSA], two\nStenotrophomonas maltophilia\n, one\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\n) and resulted in antimicrobial changes/additions to two of five of those patients. Microscopy identified seven of seven microbiologically positive organisms and 64 of 66 negative samples compared with culture. Antimicrobial changes/additions would have occurred in three of seven microscopy-positive patients had those results been clinically available in 5 hours, including one patient diagnosed later with VAP despite negative mini-BAL cultures. Overall, automated microscopy was 100% sensitive and 97% specific for high-risk pneumonia organisms compared with clinical cultures suggesting that rapid microscopy-based surveillance may be informative for treatment and antimicrobial stewardship in patients at risk for VAP. In addition, this system has been demonstrated to rapidly detect carbapenem resistance in\nK. pneumoniae\n, and, if present, predict if the resistance can be attributed to KPC carbapenemase.\n76\n",

Additionally, they found that increasing DNA load among serial EBCF samples preceded the clinical suspicion of VAP. The potential advantages of this type of diagnostic approach include noninvasive sampling of EBCF, ease of acquiring serial samples to potentially allow preemptive or targeted preventative treatment of early VAP or tracheobronchitis, and pathogen-specific characterization. The latter could help direct antibiotic therapy limiting the unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for pathogens that are not identified, thus promoting antibiotic stewardship principles. The main disadvantage of this type of PCR-directed diagnostic approach is that it does not provide true antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the causative pathogens.\n",

Use of MALDI-TOF MS significantly decreased time to organism identification, and improved time to effective antibiotic therapy as well as optimal directed antibiotic therapy.

Similarly, the PCR-based GeneXpert MRSA/SA diagnostic platform (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) was studied at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Houston demonstrating that for MSSA bacteremia, the mean time to initiation of appropriate therapy was reduced from 49.8 to 5.2 hours and the duration of unnecessary MRSA drug therapy was reduced by 61 hours per patient.\n85\nIt is hoped that the application of rapid diagnostic methods to respiratory specimens could have a similar impact on patients with pneumonia including VAP.\n",
