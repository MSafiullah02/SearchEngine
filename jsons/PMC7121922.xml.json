The determination of antiviral efficacy is relatively complex because it is not possible to design a single assay for different viruses as they require different cell systems. The fact that so many so-called \u201cexciting molecules\u201d do not graduate to the next stage is primarily due to major flaws in the screening methodologies. Some of the major challenges include using high assays dosages, using improper test controls, and the wrong selection of targets and endpoints. In spite of the progress made, little attention has been given to the influence of various reaction parameters (17). The lack of standardization in methodologies produces highly inconsistent results posing a major obstacle in developing a novel entity as a drug molecule. More commonly, the evaluation of the antiviral is based on the capability to replicate in a particular cell system.",

At a preliminary level, the in vitro efficacy is detected using markers such as cytopathic effect, plaque formation, or proliferative effects on diverse cell lines (Table 24.1). The detection of viral RNA and DNA do provide information about the viral replication. Although a number of assays have been developed there is still a need for more standardized assays to provide consistent results. The complexity in evaluation of viral inhibition is attributed to its efficient replication coupled with its genetic variation and diverse invasion strategy. Confluent monolayers of the cells are infected with virus in combination with a varied concentration of the plant extract and incubated followed by the calorimetric determination of viable cells. Radioactive-labeled viruses are employed to determine the mode of antiviral activity (18). Determination of the values of EC50 (reciprocal dilution required to prevent virus-induced cytolysis by 50%) and TCID50 (reduction of viral titer) are used as a measure to determine viral activity.\n",

            "text": "The flavonoid structure, basically a polyphenol consisting of 15-carbon atoms \u00adskeleton (C6\u2013C3\u2013C6 system) (1), constitutes the largest source of antiviral agents in the entire plant kingdom. In some compounds, the C2 carbon atom is directly linked to the oxygen as a result of which furan type molecule is formed called aurone (2). The further sub-\u00adclassification of flavonoids is based upon the oxidation and the substitution pattern of the ring C. The biochemical effects of flavonoids are attributed to their ability to inhibit the number of enzymes such as aldose reductase, xanthine oxidase, phosphodiesterase, Ca+2-ATPase, lipoxygenase, cycloxygenase, etc., besides the regulatory role on different hormones like estrogens, androgens, and thyroid hormone (19, 20). Evaluating flavonoids for activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV), Thomas et al. reported that flavonols are more active than flavones (galangin > kaempferol > quercetin) (21). Flavonoid-based polymer (MW 2100 Daltons) has displayed substantial activity against HSV type-1 and type-2 strains (22). On the basis of the evaluation of a flavonoid subset, Gerdin et al. found that flavan-3-o1 was more effective in selective inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, -2, and similar immunodeficiency virus infections (23).",

            "text": "Chalcones, having general formula ArCH=CHC(=O)Ar forms the central core for a variety of important biological compounds. Considered as precursors of flavonoids and isoflavonoids, these compounds are abundant in edible plants, and display a diverse array of pharmacological activities. Deng et al. have reported excellent antiviral \u00adactivity of chalcones 3 and 4 utilizing pharmacophore models to identify chemical \u00adsignatures considered important for the antiviral activity (24, 25). Dihydrochalcones (5) (obtained by double bond reduction of chalcone) derived from Millettia leucantha KURZ (Leguminosae) showed anti-herpes simplex virus (HSV) activity (26). Flavones, structurally characterized by 2-phenylchromen-4-one backbone, are found in Lamiaceae, Apiaceous, and Astraea families. Likhitwitayawuid et al. described the isolation and anti-HSV activities of a series of phenolic compounds identified from the heartwood of Artocarpus gomezianus, including the new antiherpetic flavone artogomezianone (6) (\n27). Prendergast et al. have used 3\u2032,4\u2032-diacetoxy-5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone or naringin (7) in the treatment of viral (e.g., HCV, HIV, a picornavirus genus virus or a respiratory virus) or parasite (e.g., toxoplasmosis) infections (28). On the basis of molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps, Mishra et al. proposed that the anti-picornavirus activities of the flavones are related with negative MEP values in two regions, one near the 3-methoxy group and another in a diagonally opposite region near the substituent attached to the C7 atom of the molecules (29). We have synthesized and confirmed the antiviral activity of several novel analogs of flavanone Abyssinone II (8), a naturally occurring prenylated flavanone, in HeLa cells using a recombinant \u03b2-galactosidase expressing strain of HSV-1(Herpes simplex virus Type 1) (30). Characterized by hydroxyl group at position C3 of the flavonone molecule (9), flavanol mixture is applied for treating and preventing hepatitis B, mycotic infection, liver protection, inflammation disease, and autoimmune disease (31). The effect of several naturally occurring dietary flavonoids including quercetin (10) on the infectivity and replication of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-I), polio-virus type 1, Para influenza virus type 3 (Pf-3), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were studied in cell culture monolayers employing the technique of viral plaque reduction. Quercetin caused a concentration-dependent reduction in the infectivity of each virus. In addition, it reduced intracellular replication of each virus when monolayers were infected and subsequently cultured in a medium containing quercetin (10). Myricetin (11), a bioflavonoid whose occurrence in nature is widespread among plants showed excellent antiviral effect against hepatitis B virus, influenza virus, and/or coronavirus (32). Anthocyanidin (12) is an important group of plant pigments having free OH group which can \u00adco-ordinate with metal ions like Ca2+ and Mg2+ under alkali conditions. This coordination ability is one the major reasons for the bioactivity of molecule. Anderson et al. have reported the therapeutic effect of anthocyanidin in the treatment of diseases caused by viruses (33). Isoflavonoids is an important class of flavonoids with impressive biological activities formed as a result of migration of phenyl group from 2 to 3 as shown in 13 (Fig. 24.1). In contrast to most other flavonoids, isoflavones (14) have a rather limited taxonomic distribution and occur mainly within the Leguminosae family. Antiviral activity on Newcastle disease virus was examined and rotenone (15) showed significant inhibitory effects on the viral growth in cultured cells as determined by the plate and tube assay methods (34). Isoflavanones bear the same relationship to isoflavones as flavanones do to flavones. And, as in the case of flavanones, isoflavanones have a chiral center (C3 in isoflavanones). PMZ-1, a prenylated isoflavonone (16), isolated Bolusanthus speciosus (Bolus Harms) has \u00adexhibited excellent activity against HIV\u2013having a broad therapeutic index (TI > 300) (35).\n",

The effect of substituted isoflavans (18) (R and R1 = H, Cl, or Br) and isoflavenes (19) on human rhinovirus (HRV) 1B infection of HeLa cells was examined by Conti and coworkers who found that these compounds inhibited virus plaque formation in cell cultures with isoflavans being more effective than isoflavenes (36). It was found that the cells pretreated with compounds before challenge with HRV-1B exhibited resistance to the virus-induced cytopathic effect. Arylcoumarins related to flavonoids biogenetically are characterized by the presence of a carbonyl function at C2 and may or may not have oxygenation at C4. A large number of coumarins has been studied for antiviral activities (37).

Emodin (57), derived from genus Rheum and Polygonum, was shown to significantly block the S protein and ACE2 interaction in a dose-dependent manner. It also inhibited the infectivity of S protein-pseudotyped retrovirus to Vero E6 cells. These findings suggested that emodin may be considered as a potential lead therapeutic agent in the treatment of SARS (63).

There have been numerous studies on the efficacy of these compounds as antiviral agents (64).

            "text": "Traditional medicine system (Egyptian, Ayurvedic, Chinese, Unani) have utilized the plant extracts/mixtures to cure infections. The underlying idea is to achieve the synergistic or combination benefits of the formulation. In addition, herbals offer a less toxic alternative to conventional therapies thereby encouraging patients to opt for this treatment. Semple and colleagues reported that Chrysophanic acid (1,8-dihydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone) (isolated from the Australian Aboriginal medicinal plant Dianella longifolia) inhibits the replication of poliovirus types 2 and 3 (Picornaviridae) in vitro (66). Terpenes and phenol esters from Plectranthus strigosus were screened against herpes viruses. The bioactivity study revealed herpetic inhibitory properties for \u00adent-16-Kauren-19-ol ent-16-kauren-19-oic acid. The compound inhibited \u00adpoliovirus-induced cytopathic effects in BGM (Buffalo green monkey) kidney cells at a 50% effective concentration of 0.21 and 0.02 g/mL for poliovirus types 2 and 3, \u00adrespectively. Phellodendron amurense bark extracts were examined and substantial antiviral activity was reported against HSV-1 utilizing the plaque inhibition assay (67). Propolis, a crude extract of the balsam which contains terpenoids, flavonoids, benzoic acids, esters, phenolics, has been found to inhibit the hemagglutination activity of inflenza virus, acyclovir resistant \u00adHSV-1, adenovirus-2 VSV, and poliovirus (68). In a study, the Dryopteris crassirhizoma extract was used to inhibit the reverse transcriptase associated DNA polymerase and RNAse H activity (69). An extract derived from Asimina triloba, has been used for the treatment of oral herpes (HSV-1) (70). Sixty-five crude extracts from 51 selected \u00adendophytic fungi isolated from Garcinia species were tested for various bioactivities. Eighty percent of the fungal extracts from fermentation broths and mycelia displayed antiviral activity (71). In a related study, organosulfur compounds derived from garlic extract protected CD4 cells from HIV attack (72). Tertagalloyl glucopyranose obtained from Juglans mandshurica inhibited reverse transcriptase and RNAse H activity while extracts of Centella asiataca and magniferin of Magnifera indica have shown promising anti-herpes HSV activity (73). The crude extract of the roots from the Australian medicinal plant Dianella callicarpa (Liliaceae) displayed significant antimicrobial and antiviral activities (74). Meliacine (a partially purified extract (meliacine) from the leaves of Melia azedarach L) exhibits a potent antiviral effect against several viruses without displaying cytotoxicity (75). The in vitro antiviral activity of the Cuban-endemic plant Phyllanthus orbicularis against HSV-1 and -2 was confirmed and it was found that the drug acted at early stages of herpesvirus replication cycle (76). The concurrent use of natural health products (NHPs) with antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) is widespread among HIV-infected patients; however, extreme caution should be exercised since some NHPs are complex mixtures and are likely to contain organic compounds that may induce and/or inhibit drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters. It has been observed that St. John\u2019s wort clearly induces cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein. This reduces protease inhibitor and non nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor concentrations, thereby increasing the likelihood of therapeutic failure (77).",

With the recent advances in understanding the biology of HIV, there has been increased focus on the usage of phytochemicals as antivirals against HIV. Owing to the vast array of chemical entities in nature, effective therapies for HIV infection are being sought in the natural world. The scope of studies of anti-HIV plant extracts is too extensive.

A large number of plant-derived products have been evaluated for their activity against polio virus. Isoobtusitin (61), a prenylated coumarin showed substantial in vitro inhibitory activity against poliovirus (IC50 = 2.9 \u03bcM) (119). Isokaempferide (5,7,4\u2032-trihydroxy 3-methoxyflavone) derived from Psiadia species was found to be an inhibitor of poliovirus type 2 replication (120). Tuli and colleagues examined the antiviral action of 3-methyleneoxindole (MO), a plant metabolite, in HeLa cells infected with poliovirus. On the basis of the experiments, authors suggested that the ability of MO to bind to ribosomes of HeLa cells may underlie the antiviral affect. Experiments showed that the poliovirus messenger RNA would not attach to those ribosomes that are already bound to MO. This resulted in the nonrecovery of virus-specific polysomes from infected cells treated with antiviral concentrations of MO (121) (Fig. 24.6).\n",

            "text": "Herpes is caused by HSV-1 and -2. It is a painful infection mainly affecting skin, eyes, mouth, and genitals. There is no permanent cure for herpes but the treatment can certainly reduce the viral shedding. There have been efforts all around the globe to identify plant-based treatment for this infection. Lyu et al. performed anti-herpetic assays on 18 flavonoids in five classes and a virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibitory assay, plaque reduction assay, along with yield reduction assay (122). EC, ECG, galangin, and kaempferol exhibited strong antiviral activity whereas catechin, EGC, EGCG (65), chrysin (66), BA (67) showed moderate activity against HSV-1. Among all the flavanols, it was found that EC and ECG displayed a high level of CPE inhibitory activity (2.5 \u00b5M [0.725 \u00b5g/mL]) and 5 \u00b5M (2.21 \u00b5g/mL), respectively), while among the flavanones naringenin expressed a strong inhibitory effect (5 \u00b5M [1.36 \u00b5g/mL]) against HSV-1. Similarly, among the flavonols, quercetin exhibited a high CPE inhibitory activity (5 \u00b5M [1.69 \u00b5g/mL]), and genistein which is an isoflavone also showed an inhibitory effect (5 \u00b5M [1.35 \u00b5g/mL]). Two dibenzocyclooctane lignans, Kadsulignan L, and Neokadsuranin were tested for their anti-HBV activities in vitro. These compounds at 0.1 mg/mL, exhibited moderate antiviral activities, inhibiting HBsAg and HBeAg secretions by 32.6 and 36.5%, and by 14.5, and 20.2%, respectively. From a structure-activity point of view, it was found that the introduction of an a-orientated AcO group enhances the antiviral activity (123). Chattopadhyay and colleagues reported substantial anti-HSV activity of Ophirrhiza nicobarica extract at 300 \u00b5g/mL. The alkaloid, flavonoid, and \u03b2-sitosterol isolated from bioactive parts had a dose-dependent therapeutic efficacy, justifying their use (124). Eugenol (4-allyl-1-hydroxy-2-methoxybenzene) was screened for efficacy against HSV-1 and HSV-2 viruses. The in vitro experiments revealed that the replication of HSV viruses was inhibited by eugenol. The inhibitory concentration 50% values for the anti-HSV effects of eugenol were 25.6 \u00b5g/mL and 16.2 \u00b5g/mL for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively, with 250 \u00b5g/mL being the maximum dose at which cytotoxicity was tested. In addition, it\u2019s worth mentioning that eugenol showed no cytotoxicity at the concentrations tested. Furthermore, the eugenol\u2013acyclovir combinations have synergistically inhibited herpesvirus replication in vitro (125). Nineteen compounds isolated from Ranunculus sieboldii and Ranunculus sceleratus were tested for inhibitory effects on hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HSV-1. The experiments revealed that apigenin 4\u2032-O-\u03b1-rhamnopyranoside, apigenin 7-O-\u03b2-glucopyranosyl-4\u2032-O-\u03b1-rhamnopyranoside, tricin 7-O-\u03b2-glucopyranoside, tricin, and isoscopoletin (18) possessed excellent antiviral activity against HBV replication. In addition, protocatechuyl aldehyde (19) also displayed substantial inhibiting activity on HSV-1 replication (126). Likhitwitayawuid et al. tested flavonoids, coumarins, phloroglucinol (68), and stilbenes (69) derivatives derived from Mallotus pallidus, Artocarpus gomezianin, and Triphasia trifolia. It was concluded that bis hydroxyphenyl structures are promising candidates for anti-HSV and anti-HIV drug development (127). The in vitro antiviral activity of galangin (3,5,7-trihydroxyflavone), the major antimicrobial compound isolated from the shoots of Helichrysum aureonitens, was investigated against herpes simplex virus type 1. The compound showed significant antiviral activity against HSV-1 (an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus) and Cox B1 (an un enveloped single-stranded RNA virus) at concentrations varying from 12 to 47 \u00b5g/mL (128). Epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate, samarangenin B derived from the roots of Limonium sinense had higher inhibitory activity than the positive control acyclovir. All of these were examined for inhibitory effect against the replication of HSV-1 virus in Vero cells (129). Du et al. isolated flavonoid leachianone from the root bark of Morus alba showing potent antiviral activity. A flavonoid moralbanone, having characteristic prenyl chain, along with seven other known compounds, was isolated from the root bark of Morus alba L. Among all the isolated compounds, Leachianone G showed potent \u00adantiviral activity (IC50 = 1.6 \u03bcg/mL) (130). Three new flavonol glycosides, namely, isorhamnetin 3-O-(6\u2033-O-(Z)-p-coumaroyl)-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside, quercetin 3-O-\u03b1-l-rhamnopyranosyl(1-2)-\u03b1-l-arabinopyranosyl(1-2)-\u03b1-l-rhamnopyranoside, and quercetin 3-O-\u03b1-l-arabinopyranosyl(1-2)-\u03b1-l-rhamnopyranoside, were isolated from the stems of Alphitonia philippinensis collected from Hainan Island, China. Some of the isolated triterpenoids and flavonoid glycosides showed cytotoxicity against human PC-3 cells and hepatoma HA22T cells, and the inhibition of replication on HSV-1 (131). Viral diseases, especially of skin, can be treated with a virucide encapsulated in multilamellar phospholipid liposomes. Rosmarinic acid (70), incorporated in phospholipid mixture demonstrated effectiveness in humans afflicted with HSV (132). Flavonol glycosides (from quercetin and isorhamnetin) derived from the stems of Alphitonia philippinensis have been reported to inhibit the replication of HSV-1. Isodihydrosyringetin, a new (2R,3S)-3,5,7,4\u2032-tetrahydroxy-3\u2032,5\u2032-dimethoxyflavanone was extracted from the root of Limonium sinense (Girard) along together with nine other known compounds. Out of all the compounds examined for their inhibitory effects on HSV-1, replication in vero cells, epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate and samarangenin B exhibited potent inhibitory activities on HSV-1 replication. Comparison of the IC50 values indicated that these both compounds had higher inhibitory activities than the positive control acyclovir (38.6 \u00b1 2.6 vs. 55.4 \u00b1 5.3 \u03bcM, P < 0.001; 11.4 \u00b1 0.9 vs.55.4 \u00b1 5.3 \u03bcM, P < 0.0005) (129). Cedrus libani, widely used as traditional medicine in the middle east for the treatment of different infections was studied for its antiviral potential. The phytochemical components \u00adisolated himachalol (22.50%), \u03b2-himachalene (21.90%), and \u03b1-himachalene (10.50%) showed promising results against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (133). Harden et al. evaluated the antiviral activity of extracts from Undaria pinnatifida, Splachnidium rugosum, Gigartina atropurpurea, and Plocamium cartilagineum against HSV-1 and HSV-2. Different assays showed that the compounds had potent virucidal activity and were active at very low concentrations (134). There are already reports in literature regarding excellent anti-HSV activity of Maclura cochinchinensis in several in vitro experiments. The authors have carried out biologically-guided separation of the active component(s). Ethyl acetate and methanol extracts exhibited anti-HSV-2 activity at EC50 values of 38.5 \u03bcg/mL and 50.8 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Biologically-guided chromatographic separation of the ethyl acetate extract yielded compound A, identified as morin using a spectroscopic method. Morin exhibited anti-HSV-2 activity at an EC50 value of 53.5 \u03bcg/mL. In order to test the activity of acetate derivative, morin penta acetate was synthesized; however, the compound did not show any activity. It was concluded that free hydroxyl groups were required for anti-HSV-activity, as demonstrated previously by other workers for the antiviral activity of other flavonoids (135).",

A large number of herbal products have been screened to measure their efficacy as anti-hepatitis drugs. One of the coumarin derivative geranyloxy-8-methoxycoumarin, best known as collinin (71) obtained from Zanthoxylum schinifolium was shown to significantly inhibit the replication of hepatitis B virus DNA (IC50 = 17.1 \u03bcg/mL (109). Seven plant extracts from six different families were found to have antiviral activity against HSV-1, at a concentration non toxic to the cell line (Vero) used. It was shown that most of these extracts have partial activity at the low concentration used. The methanol extracts of the aerial parts of Hypericum mysorense and Hypericum hookerianum, exhibited detectable antiviral effect towards HSV-1 with an inhibitory concentration for 50% (IC^sub 50^) of 100 and 50 \u00b5g/mL respectively (135). The administration of concanavalin A (Con A) to mice induces cytokine-dependent hepatitis. Okamoto et al. examined the effect of glycyrrhizin on Con A-induced hepatitis and showed that glycyrrhizin inhibited Con A-induced hepatitis without affecting cytokine expression (136) (Fig. 24.7).\n",

There are three types of viruses known to cause influenza: influenza virus A, B and C. As an integral part of traditional therapy in India and China, plant extracts have been routinely used to cure flu since old times. A number of active biological compounds have been found to possess excellent antiviral activity against the influenza virus. Antiviral flavonoid 2\u2033-O-(2\u2032\u2033-methylbutanoyl) isoswertisin obtained from the flower of Trollius chinensis was found to be moderately active toward influenza virus A. Two new flavonoid-type C-glycosides, trollisin I (=(1S)-1,5-anhydro-1-[2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-4-oxo-4H-[1]benzopyran-8-yl]-2-O-(2-methylbutanoyl)-d-glucitol) and its 2-O-benzoyl congener trollisin II, were isolated from Trollius chinensis, together with the two known compounds 2\u2033-O-(2\u2032\u2033-methylbutanoyl) isoswertisin and vitexin galactoside. In antiviral assays, the compounds were found to be moderately active towards influenza virus A (138). The inhibiting effects of isoscutellarein-8-methylether (5,7,4\u2032-trihydroxy-8-methoxyflavone, F36) obtained from Scutellaria baicalensis on the single-cycle replication of mouse-adapted influenza viruses A/Guizhou/54/89 (H3N2 subtype) and B/Ibaraki/2/85 was evaluated and it was reported that the flavone significantly suppressed the replication of these viruses in a dose-dependent manner. It was noticed that the agents suppressed the replication of these viruses from 6 to 12 h after incubation in a dose-dependent manner by 50% at 20 \u00b5M and 90% at 40 \u00b5M, respectively. Remarkably 5,7,4\u2032-trihydroxy-8-methoxyflavone, at the concentration of (50 \u00b5M) reduced the release of B/Ibaraki virus in the medium by 90\u201393% when it was added to the MDCK cells at 0\u20134 h after incubation (139). In a series of experiments, the phenolic biopolymer SP-303 was tested for its efficacy against experimentally induced influenza A (H1N1) virus infections in mice. It was found that when 30, 10, or 3 mg/kg/day of SP-303 was administered intraperitoneally once daily for 8 days, beginning either 48 h before or 4 h after virus exposure, only lung consolidation was significantly reduced (140).",

All homo isoflavonoids that were tested exhibited an inhibitory effect on rhinovirus replication with an activity depending on virus serotype and compound (141). Douglas and colleagues have reported antiviral activity of Vitamin C against rhinovirus (142). In another report, plants derived from the Echinacea family (family Asteraceae) have been shown useful for preventing and treating the common cold (143). The antiviral activity of different 2-styrylchromones was evaluated and almost all of them displayed activity against serotypes of human rhinovirus, 1B in a plaque reduction assay in HeLa cell cultures. Mechanistically, the compounds were found to interfere with HRV 1B replication. The antiviral activity of 2-styrylchromones and 3-hydroxy-1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenyl-2,4-pentadien-1-ones, which are intermediates in the synthesis have been evaluated against two selected serotypes of human rhinovirus, 1B and 14, by a plaque reduction assay in HeLa cell cultures. It was found that al most all the compounds interfered with HRV 1B replication, with the exception of 3-hydroxy-1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2,4-pentadien-1-one which did not show any significant activity. It is worth mentioning that the majority of derivatives were found to be effective against serotype 14, often with a higher potency (144, 145).",

These results indicate that virucidal activity and cytotoxicity may have depended upon the viral envelope and cell membrane, respectively. However, activity against non-enveloped virus may have been due to the inhibition of viral adsorption or penetration. The order for virucidal activity generally was: ajoene (66) > allicin (39) > allyl Me thiosulfinate (74). Tait et al. showed marked antiviral activity of homoisoflavonoids against coxsackie virus B1, B3, B4, A9, and echovirus 30. The inhibition of viral replication was monitored on BGM cells. Out of the various tested compounds, 3-benzyl chroman-4-ones (79) have displayed substantial antiviral effect towards PI-3 (parainfluenza-3) in the range of 8\u201332 \u03bcg/mL of inhibitory concentration for cytopathogenic effect (CPE) in Madin\u2013Darby bovine kidney and vero cell lines (146) Eugenol, (78) a traditional medicine has also been used against multiple viral targets (125). Singh et al. have investigated the interaction between chemokine receptor CXCR4 and flavonoids using in silico docking studies. On the basis of their studies, the authors concluded that flavonoids may also be useful as topical agents to inactivate virus, or may act as adjuvant with other antiviral drugs. Interaction network formed by disulfide bonds, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals force, and salt bridges between extracellular segments helped in maintaining the conformation of the docked complex (147). The moderate antiviral activity of the mixture of quercetin 3-O-\u03b2-glucoside and quercetin 3-O-\u03b2-galactoside derived from Chamaesyce thymifolia against HSV-1 and BVDV viruses was also reported (148). A number of substituted homo-isoflavonoids were synthesized in order to study their in vitro anti-picornavirus activity. Experiments were performed to determine the ability of non-cytotoxic concentrations to interfere with plaque formation by HRV 1B and 14 and poliovirus (PV) 2. Experiments suggested that serotype 1B was much more sensitive than 14 to the action of the compounds, and the presence of one or more chlorine atoms increased the antiviral effect in all homo isoflavonoids tested, confirming the positive influence of this substituent on activity (149). In an attempt to search for novel active agents from plant source pure flavonoids and aqueous extracts of Caesalpinia pulcherrima Swartz were screened to test their influence on a series of viruses, namely HSV-1, HSV-2, and adenoviruses (ADV-3, ADV-8, ADV-11). Results showed that the aqueous extracts of C. pulcherrima and its related quercetin possessed a broad-spectrum antiviral activity. The experiments have shown that fruit and seed extract showed the best activity (EC50 = 41.2 mg/L, SI = 83.2) as compared to stem and leaf (EC50 = 61.8 mg/L, SI = 52.1) and flower (EC50 = 177.9 mg/L, SI = 15.5). Quercetin derived from the plant possessed the strongest anti-ADV-3 activity (EC50 = 24.3 mg/L, SI = 20.4) (150). In the last decade, there has been a lot of focus on the amino sugar glucosidase inhibitors have selective antiviral activity against certain enveloped, mammalian viruses (151). It has been shown that deoxynojirimycins (DNJs) modified by reductive amination to attach a long chain to N atom (their N-DNJ derivative ) were shown to be, for example, at least 20 times more potent than the non-alkylated DNJ in inhibiting hepatitis B virus (HBV) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in cell based assays. These data suggested that the modification of the alkyl side chain could influence antiviral activity (152). De Almeida et al. reported strong inhibition of an infusion of Persea americana leaves against HSV-1, Aujeszky\u2019s disease virus (ADV) and adenovirus type 3 (AD3) in cell cultures. An extract of Persea americana leaves (Lauraceae) strongly inhibited herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), Aujeszky\u2019s disease virus (ADV) and adenovirus type 3 (AD3) in cell cultures. Its fractionation, guided by anti-HSV-1 and ADV assays, allowed the isolation and identification of two new flavonol monoglycosides, kaempferol and quercetin 3-O-\u03b1-d-arabinopyranosides, along with the known kaempferol 3-O-\u03b1-l-rhamnopyranoside (afzelin), quercetin 3-O-\u03b1-l-rhamnopyranoside (quercitrin), quercetin 3-O-\u03b2-gluco-pyranoside and quercetin. In the extract, the known quercetin 3-O-\u03b2-galactopyranoside was also identified. The authors have reported that afzelin and quercetin 3-O-\u03b1-d-arabinopyranoside showed higher activity against acyclovir-resistant HSV-1. Chlorogenic acid significantly inhibited the HSV-1 replication without any cytotoxicity. However, all the substances tested were less active than the infusion or fractions (153). A summary of major classes of antiviral phytochemicals along with their source and viral targets has been provided in Table 24.4.\n",

Well-studied polyphenol Resveratrol (81) was found to inhibit varicella\u2013zoster virus (VZV) replication in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. RT-PCR studies showed that protein and mRNA levels of IE62, an essential early viral protein, were reduced when compared to controls (205). Baicalin (BA) derived from Scutellaria baicalensis has shown substantial antiviral activities. Mechanistically, it was shown that BA inhibited the binding of a number of chemokines to human leukocytes or cells transfected to express specific chemokine receptors (206).",

A freshly prepared extract of Chelidonium majus was tested in vivo for anti-retroviral activity using highly susceptible C57Bl/6 strain in a mouse. The mice were infected intraperitoneally with 0.2 mL of the stock virus pool of defective murine leukemia retroviruses (MuLVs) LP-BM5. The animals were sacrificed (after 4 months) and a significant reduction in the weight of spleen and cervical lymph nodes was noticed in chronically infected mice treated with freshly prepared crude extract of Chelidonium majus (P = 0.0057 and P < 0.001) (208). In an effort to elucidate the action mechanism of 3-methyl quercetagetin, it was reported that the significant activity of the compound against tomato bushy stunt virus was attributed to the interference during the virus infection initiation (209). Sanchez and colleagues evaluated the possible antiviral effect of flavonoids obtained from Tephrosia madrensis, Tephrosia viridiflora, and Tephrosia crassifolia on dengue viruses and concluded that glabranine and 7-O-methyl-glabranine presented 70% inhibition on the dengue virus (210). 4-hydroxypanduratin A and panduratin chalcone derivatives derived from Boesenbergia rotunda displayed substantial inhibitory activities toward dengue 2 virus NS3 protease (Ki values of 21 and 25 \u00b5M, respectively) (211). The inhibitory effects of diosmin (82) and hesperidin (83) on the infectivity of rotavirus causing sporadic diarrhea in infants was evaluated and it was shown that both compounds were effective against rotavirus infection (212). Some of the phytochemicals have graduated to the clinical trials. Owing to the space constraints only the major clinical trials relating to the antiviral activities of phytochemicals have been summarized in Table 24.5.\n",

            "text": "Numerous epidemiological and experimental studies have revealed that a large number of the phytochemicals have promising antiviral activities. However, as discussed earlier, the development of new and better antiviral agents from plants pose a formidable challenge. One of the major challenges has been the relatively fewer number of in vivo studies coupled with inconsistency in results due to a lack of uniformity in the assays. Further, the data on the absorption metabolism and the excretion of phytochemicals in humans is contradictory and scarce. A highly interdisciplinary approach with meticulous planning and design needs to be followed for conducting the in vivo studies in a highly standardized environment. Consequently, the properly designed and rigorously executed clinical trial can help us to establish the efficacy and safety of the potential drug. In order to apply plant-based agents as an effective strategy, it is of extreme importance to understand the molecular and cellular mechanism of the \u00adcompounds with proper understanding of metabolite retention process of the system. A greater emphasis on the use of combination of micro array and proteomics techniques is needed to define the molecular targets for various micronutrients. Various techniques such as the serial expression of gene expression, protein arrays, and the evaluation of the mechanism will not only enhance our understanding of antiviral action at molecular level, but also help in finding the most effective strategy. Rational synthesis of the diverse derivatives with a more favorable profile activity can be of immense value along with the development of agent-selective endpoint markers. There is immediate need for crafting and executing an aggressive strategy involving nongovernmental organizations, chemists, microbiologists, clinicians, and experts with indigenous knowledge, failing which there are high chances of losing several untapped resources due to the extinction of plants. Combination studies/synergism is another area that has remained neglected. Further detailed studies to specify the minimum quantity of the phytochemicals to be consumed since the dosage of pure compounds effective in animals may not stay realistic when extrapolated to human system. By covering all the above gaps, it would be possible to strike a balance between the toxicity and the activity of a particular agent, which is essential for developing a new drug.",
