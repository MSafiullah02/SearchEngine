Method: Based on the method of evidence-based pharmacy, clinical evidence of therapeutical drugs for COVID-19 were retrieved and summarized. Based on clinical experience Chinese hospital pharmacists gained from providing pharmaceutical care services during COVID-19 pandemic, taking COVID-19 hospitalized patients' needs into consideration, the methods and strategies hospital pharmacists shall use to provide pharmaceutical care were analyzed and summarized. Results: Hospital pharmacists shall support pharmaceutical care services by participating in making evidence-based decisions for medication, monitoring and evaluation of medication safety and efficacy, providing strengthened care for special population and patients with combined underlying diseases, monitoring and management of convalescent plasma therapy, providing emotional counselling and psychological support, and providing scientific information about COVID-19 vaccines. Conclusion: The need of pharmaceutical care services in COVID-19 hospitalized patients during this pandemic was quite distinguished from the past. Hospital pharmacists shall join the collaborative multidisciplinary team to improve COVID-19 patients' outcome and reduce mortality, and to facilitate the pandemic control.",

Currently, no specific drug has been confirmed to treat COVID-19, and drugs of pre-approval access are still in ongoing clinical trials. The safety and efficacy of these medications remains unclear, and some drugs (such as lopinavir-ritonavir and arbidol) may cause serious adverse reactions. Therefore, hospital pharmacists should actively participate in making evidence-based decisions for medications, and assist clinicians in formulating and adjusting drug regimens of COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, hospital pharmacists should provide close monitoring and evaluation of medication safety and efficacy, management of drug interactions, and monitoring and management of convalescent plasma therapy. Based on the characteristics of special populations and patients with underlying diseases, pharmacists should provide strengthened pharmaceutical care services. In addition, the emotional status of COVID-19 patients is also an important factor affecting the treatment and prognosis of the disease. It's necessary for hospital pharmacists to provide COVID-19 patients with emotional counselling and psychological support. Given the importance and urgency of COVID-19 vaccine development for the control of global pandemic, hospital pharmacists should also provide vaccine-related scientific information to patients. To this end, the pharmaceutical care framework of COVID-19 hospitalized patients for hospital pharmacists was researched and constructed (see Fig. 1 for details) to help promote the pandemic control and patient management.",
