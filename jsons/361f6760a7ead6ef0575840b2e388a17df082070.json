The average age was 52.9 years (SD 6 16), including 107 men and 97 women. Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases). If lack of appetite is excluded from the analysis (because it is less specific for the gastrointestinal tract), there were 38 total cases (18.6%) where patients presented with a gastrointestinal-specific symptom, including diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days). In 6 cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms. As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced. Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms.",

To date, there is some uncertainty about the prevalence of extrapulmonary symptoms, such as those arising from the gastrointestinal tract. However, with the evolution of the pandemic and the accumulation of case data, we are now able to describe the initial clinical presentations of patients with COVID-19; and our experience is revealing that digestive symptoms are very common (10) . In particular, our initial observations with COVID-19 indicate that many patients present initially with diarrhea, anorexia, and vomiting, not necessarily with respiratory symptoms at first. In this study, we enrolled patients confirmed to have COVID-19 from 3 hospitals in Hubei province and investigated the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with vs without digestive symptoms.",

We excluded 96 patients who lacked complete data, such as no chest CT, missing nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 test, a negative SARS-CoV-2 test, or lacked a full set of laboratory data. This resulted in an analyzable population of 204 COVID-19-positive patients, of whom 70 (34%) were critically ill. The last follow-up at the time of writing this study was March 18, 2020. A detailed flowchart of participants is presented in Figure 1 . The baseline characteristics of 204 patients with COVID-19 are provided in Table 1 . The average age was 52.9 years (SD 6 16.0), including 107 men and 97 women. The average time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 8.1 days (SD 6 4.9). Based on epidemiological history, we found that most patients could not recall a clear history of a known exposure. There were 44 (21.6%) patients with cardiovascular diseases, 24 (11.8%) patients with endocrine system diseases, and others with respiratory diseases (9 [4.4%]), malignant tumors (13 [6.3%]), and other disorders, as shown in Table 1 .

We found that digestive symptoms are a common complaint in patients with COVID-19. By the policy of the local government, Wuhan Union Hospital was deployed as the key medical center to treat severe patients. Given the proximity of this hospital to the epicenter of the outbreak and the designation of this hospital to receive severe illness, patients in this sample were more critically ill than in other COVID-19 studies. The other 2 hospitals were designated to hospitalize mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients: Wuhan Hannan Hospital, a secondary hospital 50 km from Union Hospital, and Huanggang Central Hospital, a newly-built hospital specifically constructed for COVID-19 patients, about 80 km away from Wuhan. Our initial purpose in this study was to investigate the prevalence and characteristics or extrapulmonary digestive symptoms that might otherwise be under-recognized, thus helping to bring attention to these symptoms to facilitate earlier recognition of COVID-19 and thus to offer earlier treatment before mild disease progresses to severe illness.",

In clinical practice, patients with COVID-19 are still mainly affected by the respiratory system but evidence of damage to other system organs has been reported (12,13), and especially critical patients are susceptible to multiple organ dysfunction (14) . Our results indicate that nearly one-half of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital reported digestive symptoms, most commonly anorexia and diarrhea. This is important because if clinicians solely monitor for respiratory symptoms to establish case definitions for COVID-19, they may miss cases initially presenting with extrapulmonary symptoms or the disease may not be diagnosed later until respiratory symptoms emerge. This theory is supported by our finding that patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than those without digestive symptoms, possibly because they did not initially exhibit typical respiratory symptoms and thus did not receive timely diagnoses and treatment for COVID-19. Of note, it was reported that many medical staff in China were infected at the beginning of the epidemic. Although this was related to improper protection of medical personnel early on, it may also have resulted from failing to consider COVID-19 in the face of atypical extrapulmonary symptoms, especially those with digestive symptoms at the beginning of the outbreak.

            "text": "There are many reasons why COVID-19 seems to cause digestive symptoms. First, SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV and can invade the human body by binding to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, which causes liver tissue injury by the upregulation of ACE-2 expression in liver tissue caused by compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes derived from bile duct epithelial cells (15) . Second, SARS-CoV-2 indirectly or directly damages the digestive system through an inflammatory response. The chain reaction of inflammatory factors and viremia may injure the digestive system. Studies reveal that viral nucleic acid is detected in stool samples in up to 53.4% of patients (16) (17) (18) . Enteropathic viruses may directly damage the intestinal mucosa and cause digestive symptoms, but further research is needed to confirm this possibility. Third, the intestinal flora is colonized in the human intestine, and their numbers are astonishing and diverse. The intestinal flora plays a variety of important physiological roles in the body, such as affecting the body's nutritional metabolism, regulating the development and maturation of the body's immune system, and antibacterial effects (19) . The virus itself may cause disorders of the intestinal flora, which could result in digestive symptoms. We are currently in the process of collecting stool samples for the testing of intestinal flora diversity to explore the role of intestinal flora in this disease. Finally, the intestine is the largest immune organ in the body. Changes in the composition and function of the digestive tract flora affect the respiratory tract through the common mucosal immune system, and respiratory tract flora disorders also affect the digestive tract through immune regulation. The effect is called the \"gut-lung axis\" (20, 21) , which may further explain why patients with COVID-19 pneumonia often have digestive symptoms.",

One possibility is that digestive symptoms indicate viral load and replication within the gastrointestinal tract, which leads to more severe disease. Another possibility is that patients with extrapulmonary symptoms reported later for care because they did not initially have typical respiratory symptoms, and thus presented at a later and less curable stage of disease. These hypotheses deserve close examination in future research.",

First, our analysis was based on a retrospective study with a relatively small sample, which might cause bias and limit the reliability or generalizability of our results. Second, we did not test for RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in the stool of patients with COVID-19, so we cannot correlate digestive symptom prevalence and severity with the presence of viral RNA in stool specimens. Future research needs to focus on this relationship to further explore the prognostic value of stool testing as both a diagnostic and prognostic indicator in COVID-19. Third, blood biochemical examinations are based on a comparison of means in our study that not being subdivided to patients with individual abnormalities. Furthermore, a detailed analysis would be useful to mark some differences. Finally, given the dynamic nature of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the relationship between these patients' prognosis and digestive symptoms remains to be investigated with more data worldwide.",

In rare instances, patient can even present with digestive symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms. Compared with COVID-19 patients without digestive symptoms, those with digestive symptoms have a longer time from onset to admission and evidence of more laboratory derangements, including prolonged coagulation and higher liver enzymes tests. These results obligate additional research evaluating the prevalence, incidence, predictors, and outcomes of digestive symptoms in this still emerging pandemic. In the meantime, clinicians must bear in mind that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, may be one among the presenting features of COVID-19; in some cases, they may arise before the respiratory symptoms, and on rare occasions, it is the only presenting symptom of COVID-19. Clinicians should raise their index of suspicion when atrisk patients, such as those exposed to COVID-19, present with fever and digestive symptoms, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms. This knowledge may help with earlier identification of COVID-19, faster time to treatment, earlier quarantine, and lower exposure to bystanders.",
