Participants experienced some level of depression (PHQ mean score 14.65\u00b15.37) and anxiety (GAD mean score 11.65\u00b14.14). 14 participants reported it was difficulty to go to the clinic for medication, and 2 participants reported having been exposed to COVID-19 patients, while luckily no patients have been infected so far.

We propose the following recommendation: (1) the national public health emergency system should pay attention to MMT patients and other substance-dependent populations, including medication delivery, each prescription dosage and related regulations. (2) communications between the clinic and patients and between clinics should be strengthened via a variety of channels such as phone, mobile app (e.g. WeChat), or social media sites (Liu et al., 2020). (3) In order to prevent the client from COVID-19 infection, clinics in epidemic areas could carry out \u201cTake-home dosing plan\u201d based on special provisions for high- and low-risk patients and patients with disabilities (Matusow et al., 2018). Patients, whose daily dose is low, who usually have good compliance records, and who have no illegal records, could be allowed to take home a dose of 3 to 5 days. Implementing online appointments to get methadone with a propose dose is also necessary to reduce the risk of cross-contact of patients when visiting the clinic (Qiu et al., 2020).",
