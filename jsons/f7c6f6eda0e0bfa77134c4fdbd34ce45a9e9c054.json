Regardless of definition, cases should be resumed in a graduated fashion ( Figure   1 ) as the outbreak subsides, as COVID-19 will be persistent and \"hot-spot outbreaks\" or local surges are still possible. Surgeons should work to develop comprehensive protocols and plans for each phase of recovery, as well as identify prior indicators that may signal a second wave or resurgence of COVID-19. Most importantly, ramping up will require centralized planning to model phased demand and capacity, anticipate and address operational hurdles, and roll out a plan acceptable to staff and patients.",

The varying incidence and prevalence of COVID-19 in any given local area needs to be weighed relative to the risk to patients (e.g. peri-operative complications, disease progression) and providers (e.g. exposure to . In turn, resuming elective nonessential cases should include a review of the incidence of new COVID-19 cases in the relevant geographic area, the availability of appropriate numbers of intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU beds at a given hospital, availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators, as well as the available compliment of trained staff to perform non-essential surgical procedures without taxing resources needed to deal with the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.",

In particular, due to the risk of asymptomatic patients being positive for COVID-19, all asymptomatic patients undergoing a non-emergent surgery or procedure that is \"high-risk for aerosol generation\" must undergo COVID-19 testing prior to a surgery or procedure. Other asymptomatic patients not meeting these criteria may be tested for COVID-19 at the request of the provider performing the surgery or procedure. Patients having elective surgery are tested at one of the outpatient swab sites. At our institution we utilize a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based protocol because in most instances the test the rapid antibody test has a lower accuracy especially among asymptomatic patients.(6) Timing of the COVID-19 swabbing test depends on the patient's day of surgery. At our medical center, the patient needs to obtain their test 72-120 hours prior to surgery to ensure adequate time for the test to result prior to surgery. It is expected that the patient will remain at home except to minimize contact with other individuals, including those in their household, between the time of the COVID-19 testing and the planned procedure. As such, ancillary testing (e.g. blood work, imaging) related to the surgery/procedure need to be scheduled prior to COVID-19 testing. In turn, the considerable logistics of contacting and screening patients, as well as organizing COVID-19 testing prior to surgery needs to be tackled early. Additionally, facilities should establish policies that address the indications, requirements, and frequency for staff to be tested for COVID-19. Protocols to notify and guide patients who have a COVID-19 positive test need to be put into place prior to initiating non-essential surgery. Specifically, policies around proceeding versus delaying non-essential surgical procedures in COVID-19 patients need to be discussed and protocolized.",

In particular, medical centers should leverage local electronic medical record data to build resource utilization tools. These tools can include historical data on metrics such as inpatient length of stay, ICU utilization, blood utilization, ventilator utilization, readmission rates, emergency department visit rates, and discharge to other inpatient facilities. (7) Use of such data analytic tools can provide accurate estimates of anticipated resource utilization and help approximate the resources that may be need to perform different types of cases. In turn, such models can allow for assessment of supply and demand relative to the type of non-essential cases being re-booked. Cases that require relatively little resources such as example ambulatory cases that will not require an overnight stay should be prioritized as part of the initial phase of ramping up. As the COVID-19 disease burden continues to decrease and resources become more available, then facilities may precede with cases that will require more resources. Each phase of recovery should be predefined based on disease burden, resources, supplies, and workforce available, as well as projected utilization of resources and supplies related to the projected new surgical volume. At our institution, moving from one phase to another phase of recovery occurs in a stepwise fashion. Specifically, moving to a new phase only occurs after reevaluating policies, data, and metrics gathered during the current phase (Figure1).",

These systems should be updated regularly to reflect clinical urgency, reevaluation of patient symptoms / disease status, as well as consider other factors (e.g. chemotherapy or anticipated postoperative non-home discharge). To this end, facilities should create steering committees to help design protocols to prioritize case scheduling (Table 1) . At our institution postponed cases are rescheduled using priority scoring systems that consider 1) the patient's desire to proceed with non-essential surgery 2) clinical urgency of the clinical diagnosis 3) resources required to do the case (e.g. PPE, staff, number of hospital days, etc.), and 4) length of delay that the patient has already experienced due to the COVID-19 postponement. Some hospitals have begun to utilize the Medically-Necessary, Time-Sensitive (MeNTS) scoring system, or a modification thereof, to help prioritize postponed cases. (8) Alternatively, facilities may develop their own objective scoring system based on case specific historical institutional data to help prioritize cases in a way that is equitable and sensitive to resource allocation. At our institution we have developed our own scoring system by leveraging our experts, the electronic health record, and data warehouse management to develop a proprietary, objective scoring system ( Figure 2 ). The scoring system considers patient characteristics in addition to historical case specific data (e.g. operative time, length of stay).",

For example, some patients may not want to pursue rescheduling their operation at the moment and may not want to initiate further discussion about rescheduling in the future. Alternatively, other patients may be unsure about rescheduling their operation at the current time, but would likely reschedule at a later date; other patients may want to proceed with rescheduling immediately.

Now, as most regions of the country are beyond the peak of the pandemic, surgeons and hospital leaders are beginning to think about how to safely and effectively resume elective surgery.(3) Because thousands of surgical procedures have been delayed, providers are balancing the pent up need for elective surgery versus available supplies and workforce, all the while trying to mitigate the risk of exposure and spread of the virus.
