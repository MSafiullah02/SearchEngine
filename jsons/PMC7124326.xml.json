            "text": "Over the past 10 years, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) have moved from the research setting to routine clinical laboratory use. Molecular-based testing is now widely accepted and recognized as the new \u201cgold standard\u201d for the diagnosis of many infectious agents. NAAT are highly sensitive and specific and more rapid than traditional microbial culture. These molecular technologies have enabled laboratories to identify infectious agents that may not have been considered in the original diagnoses, and to confirm clinical diagnoses that previously would have been impossible or difficult to make (e.g., herpes simplex virus encephalitis) and have aided in the discovery of new infectious agents, such as the recently identified human metapneumovirus. These assays are particularly useful for infectious agents that cannot be cultured (e.g., hepatitis C virus), that are difficult to culture (e.g., Mycobacterium leprae), or that, for safety reasons, the laboratory would not want to culture (e.g., variola virus or the SARS-related coronavirus). Rapid diagnostics can greatly impact patient care, direct the use of appropriate antimicrobial therapies, and reduce hospitalization and overall medical costs.",

            "text": "The enhanced detection of infectious agents can be achieved either by amplifying the signal used to detect the target nucleic acid, or by directly amplifying the target nucleic acid, followed by probe-based detection. Examples of signal amplification methods used in infectious-disease diagnostics are branched DNA (bDNA, Bayer Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY) (1), ligase chain reaction (LCR, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) (2), signal-mediated amplification of RNA technology (SMART, Cytocell Technologies, Ltd, Cambridge, UK) (3), ramification amp-lification (RAM) (4), and the Invader assays (Third Wave Technologies, Madison, WI) (5). Generally, the process of nucleic acid target amplification is associated with PCR, which is an excellent method and the most widely used amplification technology. However, other, non-PCR-based target amplification technologies, including nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) (6, 7), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) (8), and strand displacement amplification (SDA) (9, 10), have been used successfully in a variety of commercial assays for detecting infectious agents. Non-PCR target amplification assays generally offer sensitivity and specificity equal to PCR and, in some cases, have advantages for certain applications. As with PCR, these applications are adaptable to all nucleic acid targets (DNA, RNA, mRNA, and rRNA), have multiplex capabilities, and can be qualitative or quantitative. The products of the amplification reactions are single-stranded nucleic acids that do not require denaturation prior to hybridization with traditional probes for end-point detection or with the fluorescent probes used in real-time detection procedures. The amplification reactions are isothermal and can be performed in a heat block, water bath, or incubator/fluorometer, thus greatly reducing equipment costs compared to real-time multi-dye PCR thermocyclers.",

(11) using the NucliSens isolation reagents, total nucleic acids can be purified from a variety of sample types, including whole blood, dried blood spots, blood film slides, plasma, serum, tissue, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, body fluids, stool, respiratory samples, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Samples in volumes ranging from 2 to 10 ml are added to NucliSens lysis buffer containing guanidine thiocyanate and Triton X-100. Viral particles, bacterial particles, or cells are disintegrated, and the nucleic acids are released. Any RNases and DNases present in the sample are inactivated. Silicon dioxide particles are added to the lysed sample. Under high salt conditions, these particles act as a solid phase to capture the nucleic acids. The particles are washed several times to remove proteins and inhibitors. Finally, the highly purified concentrated nucleic acids are eluted from the silica particles in RNase/DNase-free water. Extractions can be performed manually or with automated or semi-automated extraction systems (see \u201cAutomation for NucliSens assays\u201d below).",

Detection of the RNA products can be achieved by using two different formats, either end-point ECL detection or in real time using molecular-beacon technology (12). For ECL detection (Fig. 2), aliquots of diluted amplicons are added to hybridization solutions containing a streptavidin paramagnetic bead with a bound target-specific oligonucleotide that functions as a solid phase to capture the amplified targets. Also included in the hybridization reaction mixture is a ruthenium (Ru2+)-labeled detection probe. The Ru2+ probe can either be target specific (e.g., NucliSens HIV-1 QT assay) or generic (as supplied in the NucliSens Basic Kit detection module). If generic Ru2+ probes are used, the P2 amplification primer is designed to contain a sequence complementary to the sequence on the generic Ru2+ probe. The resulting amplicons are detected by using the target-specific bead-oligonucleotide and the Ru2+ detection probe (Fig. 2D). ECL hybridizations are performed at 41\u00b0C, followed by ECL detection using the NASBA QR reader (bioM\u00e9rieux).\n",

Molecular beacons (Fig. 3) are hairpin structures that consist of a single-stranded loop sequence complementary to the target and a short 6- to 7-bp stem to which a fluorophore, e.g., rhodamine or fluorescein, is attached to the 5\u2032 end and a quencher, such as dabcyl, is attached to the 3\u2032 end of the beacon sequence. In the native state, the beacon is a closed structure, held together by the complementary stem sequences. Since the fluorophore and quencher are in close proximity, little or no fluorescent light is emitted. In the presence of complementary target sequences, the beacons bind to this target and undergo a structural change, thereby separating the fluorophore and quencher. Light is emitted and measured at specific UV wavelengths. Both the target and the internal-control molecular beacons, each with its specific fluorophore, are added at the start of the amplification reaction. Target amplification at 41\u00b0C and continuous monitoring of the emitted fluorescence of both molecular beacon probes are performed simultaneously using a NucliSens EasyQ Analyzer (bioM\u00e9rieux, Boxtel, The Netherlands).\n",

Total plasma nucleic acids and three internal calibrators (supplied with the kit) of known low, medium, and high HIV-1 RNA concentrations are co-extracted (Fig. 2A). Extractions can be performed manually or with the automated NucliSens Extractor. Co-amplification of wild-type patient HIV-1 RNA (sense RNA) and the internal calibrators (Fig. 2B) is performed in a single tube using two DNA oligonucleotides that are specific for the gag region (encoding core proteins) of the HIV-1 target sequence. The single-stranded RNA product can then be readily detected by ECL after hybridization of wild-type or calibrator-specific Ru2+-labeled oligonucleotide probes (Fig. 2C and D). The amount of light generated (ECL units) is proportional to the amount of the product amplificate (RNA copies/ml) (Fig. 2E). Calculation is based on the relative amounts of RNAs of the four amplificates (wild type patient sample and three calibrators) that determine the original amount of wild-type HIV-1 RNA in the sample. No additional external controls or standards are necessary for the quantitation. However, the manufacturer recommends that a high positive control, a low positive control, and a negative control be included with the first run of each kit lot and a negative control and a low positive control with each subsequent run of the same kit to verify product performance. An external control can also be used to monitor assay reproducibility from lot to lot, run to run, and technician to technician. A multicenter clinical evaluation of the HIV-1 QT assay determined that the linear range of the assay was 51 to 5,390,000 RNA copies/ml, with a cutoff of 25 RNA copies/ml (14). The 50% detection rate was 41 RNA copies/ml, and the 95% detection rate was 176 RNA copies/ml. The mean reproducibility of the assay over the dynamic range was 0.15 log standard deviation, and the specificity was 100%.",

The assay targets pp67 mRNA, which encodes a phosphorylated matrix tegument protein transcribed from the UL 65 gene. pp67 mRNA is one of the most abundant late gene transcripts and is detectable only during viral replication. The presence of pp67 transcripts, therefore, is indicative of active CMV infection and should not be detected during latent infection. Studies have demonstrated that CMV pp67 late gene transcripts are an alternative target for determining active CMV infection in renal allograft recipients and heart, lung, and bone marrow transplant recipients (17). Nucleic acids from plasma and an internal control are co-extracted and co-amplified by NASBA, followed by ECL detection. The lower limit of detection for the assay is less than 25 mRNA copies. A multicenter clinical trial study demonstrated an 86% concordance between the pp67 assay and current reference tests, including cell culture and a CMV p65 antigenemia assay, when active CMV disease was present (16). Although not FDA approved for testing CSF, studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that the detection of pp67 mRNA in CSF was a better predictor of active CMV-related central nervous system disease than the detection of CMV DNA by PCR (18).",

Currently, over 90 applications have been validated that target bacteria, viruses, mycobacteria, fungi, parasites, chemokines, cytokines, and genetic markers. The NucliSens Basic Kit permits standardization of all assays to one easy format. The NucliSens Kit components include four separate modules for each stage of analysis: sample lysis, nucleic acid isolation, amplification, and detection. Detection can be performed by using ECL and the generic Ru2+ probe supplied in the basic kit or in real time by adding target-specific molecular beacons to the amplification reaction. The user designs the primers and capture probes (ECL detection) or molecular beacons. Currently, one ASR that uses NASBA and molecular beacons is available for the detection of enterovirus from CSF (bioM\u00e9rieux) (19). The assay targets the 5\u2032 non-coding region of the enteroviral genome and has broad reactivity, detecting echoviruses, coxsackieviruses, numbered enteroviruses, and poliovirus, with no cross-reactivity to numerous other viruses tested (20). The assay is internally controlled for monitoring the efficiency of the entire process, from isolation to detection. Studies from our laboratory have shown that the rate of amplification inhibition is less than 0.5%, and all inhibited samples were grossly bloody. The sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10 to 100 RNA copies per amplification reaction (20). The enterovirus NASBA assay detected 23% more positive CSF samples than routine viral culture (21). The rapid diagnosis of enteroviral infections can significantly reduce the length of hospital stay and reduce overall medical costs (21).",

A NASBA assay developed in our laboratory for detecting malaria parasites combines the use of molecular beacons for a generic screening assay and ECL detection for species identification in positive samples (22). Whole-blood samples, dried blood spots, or scrapings from stained blood film slides are screened using primers and a molecular beacon generic for all four Plasmodium species. The assay can detect all four species with comparable sensitivities (0.0001 parasites/reaction) in as little as 12 min. Amplicons from positive samples are hybridized with species-specific capture probes and the generic Ru2+ probe, followed by ECL detection. The assay was 100% sensitive compared to traditional microscopy. The NASBA assay was more specific than microscopy, particularly for slides that were difficult to interpret or when very low levels of parasitemia were present. The assay was superior to microscopy for the detection of mixed infections.",

One primer contains the promoter sequence for T7 RNA polymerase. This promoter primer binds to the target sequence, and RT creates a DNA copy of the target strand by extension from the 5\u2032 end of the promoter primer, resulting in an RNA-DNA hybrid. The RNase H activity of the RT degrades the RNA in the RNA-DNA hybrid, resulting in single-stranded DNA that contains the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence. The second primer binds the DNA copy, and a new DNA strand is synthesized by the RT, resulting in a double-stranded DNA copy that contains the T7 polymerase promoter sequence. T7 polymerase binds to the promoter sequence and initiates transcription off the DNA template, resulting in many copies of RNA (100 to 1,000 per DNA template). Each of the newly synthesized RNA copies enters into the amplification cycle and serves as a template for the TMA process. There is an exponential expansion of the RNA, resulting in the production of up to 10 billion amplicons within 15 to 30 min. RNA amplicons can then be detected by using a variety of technologies that will be described in the next issue (CMN vol. 26, no. 17).\n",
