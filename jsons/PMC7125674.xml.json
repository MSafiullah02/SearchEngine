Among the several applications of adamantane derivatives, two are of the highest interest. First, the adamantane scaffold is used as a sterically demanding group in the synthesis of ligands for transition metal catalysts. Currently there are several adamantane-derived phosphines, such as Me-DalPhos\u00ae, Mor-DalPhos\u00ae, AdBrettPhos\u00ae, cataCXium\u00ae A, that are commercially available (Fig. 1\n).1 Of note, the use of heteroadamantanes in catalysis has been less studied. The nitroxyl radical AZADO, a highly active catalyst for alcohol oxidation with superior catalytic proficiency to the well-known TEMPO, is a remarkable exception (Fig. 1).2\n",

As it is known that alcohols behave better in the Ritter reaction, we attempted to obtain 11 from the known alcohol 12.8 To our satisfaction, reaction of 12 with chloroacetonitrile in acidic medium proceeded uneventfully to furnish 9 in high yield. Finally, cleavage of the haloacetamide group by using thiourea, either from pure 9 or from a mixture of 9 and 10, furnished 2-oxaadamantane-5-amine, 11, in good yield.
