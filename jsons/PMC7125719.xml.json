Of the four open reading frames (ORFs), the two central ORFs 2a and 2b are translated into polyproteins. ORF 2a codes for polyprotein 2a with a domain arrangement of membrane anchor-serine protease-VPg\u2013P10\u2013P8 (Fig. 1\na) [2]. ORF 2b is translated by \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting into polyprotein 2ab (MA-protease-VPg-RNA dependent RNA polymerase). The N-terminal serine protease domain was shown to be responsible for the processing of the polyproteins into functional domains [2], [3]. Our recent study demonstrated that the removal of membrane anchor via the cleavage at E132-S133, is essential for the cleavage at E498\u2013S499 site between protein of size 10 kDa (P10) and protein of size 8 kDa (P8) domains [2].",

Bioinformatic analysis was performed for both polyprotein 2a and P8 domain, using the RNABindR software available at (www.bindr.gdcb.jastate.edu/RNABindR), in order to identify the presence of any RNA binding sites. The results revealed that in the entire polyprotein 2a, only P8 (residues 34\u201368) had a RNA binding region (data not shown). In order to test this, the purified P8 was incubated with genomic RNA in the binding buffer and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. With increasing amounts of P8 (0.5\u20135 \u03bcg), the nucleoprotein complex showed increase in the retardation and at 5 \u03bcg of P8, the complex remained in the well (Fig. 2\na). It was of interest to see if P8 could also bind to DNA. Increasing amounts of the protein (0.5\u20135 \u03bcg) was incubated with 125 ng of VPg\u2013P10\u2013P8 PCR product (743 bp). As observed in Fig. 2b, there was an increase in the retardation of the DNA-P8 complex with increasing amounts of P8, indicating that P8 could also bind to the dsDNA. Further, P8 could bind to other non-specific RNA and DNA such as poly A and M13 primer (data not shown), suggesting that binding of P8 to nucleic acids could be non-specific. These results suggest that P8 can bind to single or double stranded nucleic acid.",

Together, these findings suggest that region at the C-terminus of VPg in the polyprotein may play an essential role in the viral life cycle. For example, it is possible that polyprotein 2a could bind to the gRNA via C-terminal P8 RNA binding domain that might aid in correctly positioning the natively unfolded VPg to get uridinylated by RdRp, following which the P10\u2013P8 domain could get cleaved off. Further studies need to be carried out to establish any such possibility. In 40% of the RNA binding proteins, the RNA binding sites overlap with the nuclear localization signal (NLS). Prediction shows that P8 may have a bipartite NLS (data not shown). It would be interesting to see if P8 or its precursors could enter the nucleus of the host cell and act as transcriptional regulators.",

The protein was expressed and purified as described in Section 2 (Fig. 1c, lane 3). Purified His tagged P18 also showed mass abnormality (25 kDa instead of 19 kDa). When increasing amounts of protein (0\u20130.8 \u03bcg) was incubated with \u03b3-32P ATP, a dose dependent increase in the release of 32Pi was observed (Fig. 3b). Further, as seen in Fig. 3c, lane 2, P18 immunodepleted with anti P8 antibodies showed no release of 32Pi as against the control P18 (Fig. 3c, lane 1), confirming that the ATPase activity was inherent to P18. Most of the viral ATPases are known to be stimulated by nucleic acids [13], [14]. Therefore ATPase assay with P18 was carried out in the absence and presence of poly A (0.5 mg/ml). As seen in Fig. 3d, P18 ATPase was substantially inhibited in the presence of poly A. A similar kind of inhibition was also reported for the ATPase activity of Human coronavirus 229E nsp13 and poliovirus protein 2C, though the reason for the inhibition was unclear [15], [16]. The inhibition of P18 ATPase by poly A could be due to the binding of poly A to P8 domain. Since, gRNA incubated with P10 did not show any retardation in EMSA (data not shown), it is unlikely that P10 could be involved in such an inhibition by poly A.",

The region corresponding to P10 was cloned in pRSET C vector, expressed and purified as described in Section 2. Fig. 1c, lane 4 shows the purified P10 protein. As seen in Fig. 5\na with increasing amounts of the P10 (0\u20130.8 \u03bcg), a dose dependent increase in the release of 32Pi was seen suggesting that unlike P8, P10 alone could hydrolyze ATP. The ATPase activity of P18 and P10 was performed with increasing concentrations of ATP. The Lineweaver\u2013Burk plot (1/v vs 1/[ATP]) was obtained (Fig. 5b) and the kinetic parameters were calculated. The Km for P18 and P10 was 90.9 \u03bcM and 27.7 \u03bcM and V\nmax was 4.29 and 1.71 pmol/min/\u03bcg, respectively. k\ncat for P18 and P10 was 0.0815 and 0.0188 min\u22121, respectively. In the presence of P8 domain, there was an increase in the k\ncat of P10 ATPase by 4.3-fold, V\nmax by 2.5-fold and K\nm by threefold. In other words, the ATPase activity of P10 domain was influenced by the natively unfolded P8 domain. Interestingly, in SeMV, the serine protease domain is also rendered active by VPg, yet another natively unfolded domain present at its C-terminus [9]. More intriguing is the fact that, like VPg P8 is also present at the C-terminus of P10. However, VPg present at the N-terminus of RdRp has been shown to have inhibitory effect on the in vitro polymerase activity of the later (unpublished observations). The alternating arrangement of folded and unfolded domains in SeMV polyprotein 2a, therefore appears to be a strategy operating to regulate the activities of the domains.",
