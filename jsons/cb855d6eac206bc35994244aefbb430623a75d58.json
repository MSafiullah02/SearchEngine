Both proteins are trimers with head-and-tail morphology. They share unique domain structures and functional properties including defined regions of flexibility within the tail and an unusual symmetry mismatch with the pentameric viral capsid protein into which they are inserted. Moreover, the receptors for reoviruses and adenoviruses, junctional adhesion molecule 1 and coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor, respectively, also share key structural and functional properties. Although reoviruses and adenoviruses belong to different virus families and have few properties in common, the observed similarities between 1 and fibre point to a conserved mechanism of attachment and an ancient evolutionary relationship.",

            "text": "Specific attachment of viruses to cell-surface receptors is the initial step in viral infection. Although there exists substantial diversity in the types of receptors recognised by different viruses, all viruses must possess a strategy to penetrate cell membranes. Enveloped viruses achieve this through fusion of viral and cellular membranes, and many enveloped viruses employ a common strategy for this fusion process based on the formation of hydrophobic, triple-helical coiled-coil structures that are thought to insert into the cell membrane and initiate fusion. The identification of highly conserved trimeric coiled-coil structures in the glycoproteins of several enveloped viruses (e.g. Ebola virus, HIV and influenzavirus) has led to a model for their conserved mechanism of action (reviewed in [1] ). In contrast to enveloped viruses, much less is known about the attachment and entry strategies used by nonenveloped viruses, a group that includes several important human pathogens. As is the case for enveloped viruses, identification of conserved structural features in nonenveloped viruses will likely facilitate an understanding of common mechanisms used by these viruses for attachment and cell entry.",

Most importantly, adenoviruses have a double-stranded (ds) DNA genome, whereas reoviruses contain dsRNA. Both viruses, however, interact with cell-surface receptors using trimeric, fibre-like molecules located at the 12 vertices of the virion icosahedron.

However, the structural changes that accompany reovirus attachment and entry, and its transition from the virion to subvirion intermediate and core particle [10] , are poorly understood. The 1 protein is key to precise delineation of these events as it facilitates viral attachment and undergoes major conformational changes during viral disassembly [6, 10] . The 1 protein binds two types of receptors and attaches to cells using an adhesionstrengthening mechanism [13] . A domain in the 1 tail binds to cell-surface carbohydrate [8] , which is known to be -linked sialic acid for serotype 3 reoviruses [14] [15] [16] [17] , and the 1 head binds to junctional adhesion molecule 1 (JAM1) [9] . The 1 protein plays a pivotal role in determining strainspecific disease patterns in animal models [18, 19] , most likely by selective recognition of cell-surface receptors. It also is responsible for strain-specific differences in the efficiency of virus-induced apoptosis [20] [21] [22] .",

Each monomer contains two domains: a slender tail and a compact head ( Figure 1 ). Residues 246-309 form the tail, a triple -spiral that contains sequence repeats characterised by conserved hydrophobic and glycine or proline residues [2, 3] . Each repeat consists of two short -strands connected by a four-residue -turn that has either a proline or a glycine residue at its third position. A surface-exposed, variable loop links successive repeats, and trimerisation generates the highly regular -spiral structure. The remaining 1 residues (310-455) assemble into a compact -barrel that forms the head. The 1 trimer features a distinct kink between the three-fold axes of the head and tail domains (Figure 1) . Although this kink is most likely introduced by crystal packing forces, it indicates that the 1 trimer possesses a high degree of flexibility between the second and third -spiral repeats in the tail.",

They contain dsDNA genomes and form particles with a diameter of about 1000 \u00c5 [24] . The adenovirus capsid includes 240 copies of the trimeric hexon protein and 60 copies of the pentameric penton protein, which is located at the 12 vertices of the icosahedral particle. The penton protein forms the penton base complex, which serves as the anchor for the trimeric attachment protein, fibre, an elongated structure that protrudes from the virion surface. The fibre can be subdivided into a thinner 'shaft' and a more globular 'knob'. Adenovirus serotypes 2, 5 and 12 bind to the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) [25, 26] by using a binding site located in the knob [27] [28] [29] . Crystal structures of the knob have been determined for serotypes 2 [30] and 5 [31] , as well as for the non-CAR-binding serotype 3 [32] . Structures are also available for a complex between the serotype 12 knob and the N-terminal domain of CAR [33] and for a trimeric fragment that comprises the knob and a portion of the shaft of the serotype 2 fibre [3] . The latter structure revealed that the shaft forms a triplespiral ( Figure 1 ). Although only a short -spiral was seen in the crystallised fragment, residues 45 to 392 of the serotype 2 fibre are predicted to form a continuous 22-repeat -spiral with residues 399-582 comprising the C-terminal knob [3] .",

Both are trimeric, elongated fibrous structures of roughly equivalent length that contain multiple repeats of an N-terminalspiral followed by a globular domain with eight major -strands ( Figure 1 ). The 1 tail is predicted to also contain an -helical coiled-coil N-terminal to the -spiral [2] , whereas the fibre shaft is most likely composed entirely of -spiral repeats [3] . The two proteins are to date the only structures known to contain such triple -spiral motifs, and thus they use a unique design for trimer formation. Most trimeric protein structures are based on -helical coiled-coils, in which three amphipathic -helices are wrapped around each other [2] and adenovirus fibre (right) [3] . The three monomers within each trimer are shown in red, orange and blue. Both proteins have head-and-tail morphology, with a triple -spiral forming the tail and an eight-stranded -sandwich domain forming the head.

Sequences that form these amphipathic -helices are characterised by a heptad repeat, in which non-polar residues are found at the first and fourth positions of the repeating unit [34] . Trimerisation motifs based on -sheet structures are far less common and have to date been observed in very few cases. For example, the bacteriophage T4 gp5 and gp12 proteins each contain triple -helices [35, 36] , trimeric structures formed by -strands that are roughly parallel to the trimer axis. The bacteriophage T4 gp12 protein also contains an additional trimeric structure that somewhat resembles the -spirals seen in reovirus 1 and adenovirus fibre, although it is not a true -spiral [35] . The surprising structural similarities between reovirus 1 and adenovirus fibre also extend to their C-terminal domains, both of which are globular structures that contain eight antiparallel -strands ( Figure 2) . A large number of domain folds are based on a core structure of eight antiparallel -strands, ranging from the ubiquitous -sandwich domains of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily [37] to the circular -barrel of the E. coli outer membrane protein (omp) A [38] and the jelly-roll motif found in many viral coat proteins [39] . The principal difference between these folds lies in the manner in which the various -strands are connected (i.e. the 'topology' of each domain). Thus, analysis of the connectivity of a given fold serves to establish a structural relationship. The connectivity of -strands in the 1 head and the fibre knob is unique to these two proteins, demonstrating that they are more similar to each other than to any other protein for which structural information is available. This relationship is underscored by the observation that homology searches [40] with the coordinates of either domain yield the other as the only close structural homologue [2] . One difference between the two folds is that the -strands of the 1 head circularise to form a round -barrel, whereas the fibre knob is a -sandwich domain with two separate -sheets facing each other. The only other known circular -barrel featuring eight antiparallel strands is that of the ompA protein [38] , a membraneembedded domain with very different connectivity ( Figure 2) .",

The 1 head features extremely short connections between most -strands (except the D-E loop), which results in a highly compact structure.

A comparison of the three independent molecules present in the crystals reveals that a linear insertion into the -spiral (residues 291-294 of T3D 1) allows for substantial movement of the head with respect to the tail (Figure 3 ). This mobility is likely increased in the absence of constraining crystal packing forces, and it would allow the 1 head to 'sway' above the reovirus capsid in a physiologic context. Electron microscopic images of full-length 1 show flexibility in a region of the molecule that corresponds to this insertion and also in a second region close to the midpoint of the protein [7] . This latter region of flexibility, which is not included in the crystallised 1 fragment, correlates with the transition from the predicted N-terminal -helical coiled coil to the more C-terminal triple -spiral [2] . The adenovirus fibre does not have an insertion similar to that of 1 beneath the knob domain, and the four turns of -spiral that precede the knob are uninterrupted. However, residues 394-396 of fibre, which follow the last spiral turn in sequence, have poor electron density and are presumed to be flexible [3] . These poorly ordered residues appear to act as a hinge that allows the knob to move with respect to the shaft. The three-fold axes of the fibre knob and shaft differ by 2 [3] , and comparison of the three independent copies of the fibre molecule in the crystal structure demonstrates that this difference translates into significant mobility between the shaft and knob (Figure 3) . Thus, the trimeric knob can move as a whole with respect to the spiral, although the movement is somewhat more modest than that observed for 1. also has several other kinks within its -spiral [41, 42] , and these likely represent additional regions of flexibility.",

In the case of adenoviruses, shaft flexibility is a critical determinant of receptor binding as the rigid serotype 37 fibre fails to engage CAR despite the presence of the CAR-binding epitope in the knob [43] . Although similar analyses of 1 have not been performed, it seems probable that mobility between the globular and fibrous regions of both 1 and fibre is required for optimal positioning of the receptor-binding surfaces of these attachment proteins with their cell-surface receptors. It is striking that 1 and fibre use functionally equivalent hinge regions just beneath their globular head domains for this purpose.",

The reovirus 1 trimer is inserted into a slot formed by the l2 pentamer, the structure of which is known [11] . The adenovirus fibre is inserted into the penton base, also a pentameric structure. Thus, in both cases a unique A 3 B 5 complex is formed. While symmetry mismatches have been seen in other protein complexes such as the AB 5 toxins [44] , the F1 ATP synthase [45] , or the VP1/ VP2 polyomavirus complex [46] , they are not common. Such mismatches usually indicate interactions of limited strength or specificity, and proteins involved in these mismatches often undergo rearrangement. They also are often hydrophobic in nature. AB 5 toxins such as cholera toxin undergo dramatic conformational changes upon membrane binding [44] , and this change involves exposure of the A subunit. The symmetry mismatch of three , three , and one subunit in F1 ATPase is crucial for its rotational mechanism of action, with the subunit forcing asymmetry onto the 3 3 pseudohexamer and providing a hydrophobic contact area that allows for efficient rotation [45, 47] . The structure of a polyomavirus VP1/VP2 complex, in which a single VP2 molecule engages a hydrophobic channel at the centre of the VP1 pentamer, suggests that some rearrangement must occur during viral entry in order to expose the myristylated VP2 N-terminus [46] . Thus, the conserved A 3 B 5 mismatch in both reovirus and adenovirus indicates a strong potential for structural rearrangement, which may occur upon receptor binding or disassembly. Moreover, the A 3 B 5 stoichiometry suggests that a conserved mechanism underlies these processes. To our knowledge, these structures are the only examples of A 3 B 5 complexes.",

Three-dimensional structures change much more slowly than amino acid sequences, and structural analyses can sometimes reveal a previously unsuspected relationship between viruses. However, the biological relevance of such a link may not be apparent. The jelly-roll motif, for example, has thus far been found in a large number of viruses, but it is not associated with a conserved function. It therefore appears to serve as a scaffold used by many viruses to construct their capsids, similar to the Ig-like domain that is the structural motif of choice for many cell-surface receptors. For cases in which structural homologies parallel conserved function, an evolutionary relationship is more likely, and indeed several examples have been identified. The conservation of key structural and functional features between the alphavirus glycoprotein E1 [58, 59] and the flavivirus glycoprotein E [60] suggests a common progenitor. Structural similarities between the adenovirus hexon protein and the P3 capsid protein of bacteriophage PRD1 also have led to the suggestion of an evolutionary relationship between the two proteins [61] . In both cases, the structural similarities extend beyond the conservation of a single domain and translate into common functional properties. The same is true for the reovirus and adenovirus attachment proteins, and thus we think that the similarities between them point to a conserved mechanism of action and a distant evolutionary relationship, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the similarities have arisen through convergent evolution.",

            "text": "Since reovirus and adenovirus face similar challenges in the initiation of an infectious cycle, it is perhaps not too surprising that these viruses have evolved highly similar fibre-like proteins for attachment to host cells. Particles of both viruses are relatively large, and the long fibrelike tail may be required to allow the head to reach cell-surface receptors, which in both cases contain only two Ig-like domains and thus are located close to the cell membrane. Viruses typically engage membrane-distal regions of their receptors, and in many cases these virus-binding epitopes are found on more protruding receptors with more than two domains [55, 56, 62, 63] . Flexibility at a region just below the head domain may facilitate the engagement of receptors by allowing the head to position itself properly for a productive interaction. Thus, a globular head domain with [49] and adenovirus receptor CAR (right) [48] . Both proteins form dimers using the same interface (formed by -strands G, F, C, and C') of the membrane-distal Ig-like domain. The adenovirus fibre knob binds to a monomeric version of CAR [33] Reovirus and adenovirus attachment proteins Reovirus and adenovirus attachment proteins 129 129 numerous protruding loops offers the opportunity to modulate this interaction. Finally, the triplespiral creates a highly stable, regular trimeric structure that nonetheless allows for sequence variations and insertions in its surface-exposed loops. This design feature includes added functionality that is missing in the more common -helical coiled-coil trimerisation motif. In both reoviruses and adenoviruses, different serotypes are distinguished in part by insertions and deletions in the triple -spiral region, and these differences lead to altered surface properties. For example, thespirals of serotype 1 and 3 reoviruses contain binding sites for carbohydrate receptors in two distinct regions [8] , and differences in -spiral loops between adenovirus serotypes are at least partially responsible for serotype-specific antigenic determinants [3] . In both cases, the loops emanating from the -spiral structure are also likely to mediate contacts with other viral capsid proteins.",

            "text": "It is tempting to speculate that the numerous structural and functional parallels between the reovirus and adenovirus attachment proteins, which are reinforced by similarities between their receptors JAM1 and CAR, lead to conserved routes of entry and mechanisms of infection. We note that both receptor proteins are located at tight junctions. JAM1 was originally identified as an intercellular adhesion protein located at tight junctions and named accordingly [64] . CAR was shown recently to be a component of tight junctions between epithelial cells [65] . The fact that both viruses use tight junction proteins as receptors raises the possibility of conserved themes of receptor recognition, internalisation, tropism and disease. Thus, reovirus and adenovirus may have more in common than the striking structural similarities exhibited by their attachment proteins. Future studies will hopefully reveal the full extent of the fascinating relationship between these two pathogens.",

The superposition of the three monomers in each trimer reveals a defined region of flexibility with a hinge just below the head domain in each case. One trimer is shown in red, orange, and blue; the other two are shown in grey Ribbon tracings of the reovirus 1 head (left) and the adenovirus fibre knob (right). In addition to the conserved -sheet topology, the head and knob structures share a short helix in a long loop at the domain base. The -sheet topologies for the two domains are shown on the far right, adjacent to the topologies for the unrelated jelly-roll and ompA structures, which also contain eight -strands",
