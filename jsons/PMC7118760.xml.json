A majority of the ethics and infectious disease literature has focused on HIV/AIDS, SARS, pandemic influenza and bioterrorism. This article will review four major ethical issues associated with pandemic influenza: the obligation of individuals to avoid infecting others, healthcare workers' \u2018duty to treat\u2019, allocation of scarce resources, and the use of coercive social distancing measures. In each case, ways in which the ethical issues turn on both philosophical and empirical questions are highlighted.",

            "text": "While bioethics has traditionally focused on the dyadic relationship between healthcare workers and patients and/or healthcare policy making, contagious infectious diseases raise issues of individual morality. In the event of a major flu pandemic, the failure of an individual to take precautionary infection control measures may endanger the lives of others. Such dangers are, of course, most obvious when an individual knows he/she is infected and contagious, but they also arise when an individual has reason to believe that he/she might be infected (and contagious) because he/she was or may have been exposed to someone else who was contagious. While the widely accepted \u2018duty to do no harm\u2019 would appear to require that infected or potentially infected individuals should take action to avoid (potentially lethally) endangering others, there surely must be limits to such a duty. We cannot, that is, expect everyone who is or just might be infected to do everything that they can to avoid the infection of others; that would unnecessarily bring too many lives to a standstill. What, then, are the limits to the duty in question? And to what extent should the duty be enforced by law?",

            "text": "Although these questions are both interesting and difficult, they have received surprisingly little discussion to date. The author is only familiar with two papers on this particular topic.10, 11 No attempt will be made to answer such questions fully in this article, although a number of suggestions are offered. First, it is safe to say that the strength of an individual's duty to take precautionary infection control measures, e.g. submitting oneself to voluntary quarantine, limiting interaction with others, wearing a mask, etc., should be proportional to the risk that one is actually infected: the greater the probability that someone is infected, the more he/she should do to avoid exposing him-/herself to others. Second, more research should aim to establish evidence regarding the effectiveness of infection control measures. If evidence reveals that masks, for example, provide highly effective means of infection prevention, then the duty (of even those not especially likely to be infected) to wear masks would be higher than would otherwise be the case. Such research is scientifically important, but there is also an ethical imperative that more of this type of research takes place. Third, there is a need to raise greater public awareness of both the ethical imperative to avoid infecting others and the available means of preventing infection. Fourth, when an individual fails to voluntarily take morally required precautions against the infection of others, legal sanctions and/or the use of force may be justified. This follows from Dworkin's suggestion that if actions are immoral, \u2018then the freedom to pursue them counts for less\u2019.12\n",

The duty in question is also often explicitly stated in health professions' codes of conduct. It is sometimes additionally argued that the duty is established via social contract. Healthcare workers receive special, often exclusive, education and training, and they are granted other privileges by society; the expectation is that they will provide health care, when needed, in return.14 If trained health professionals refuse to provide care in times of emergency, there is no one else to turn to.",

If a healthcare worker becomes ill or dies as a result of treating this particular patient, for example, then he/she may not be able to treat other patients to whom he/she also has duties, and he/she may not be able to fulfil duties to family members or other loved ones. Healthcare workers also have duties to co-workers. Healthcare provision involves teamwork, and if a worker refuses to work, someone else will be called in to do the job. If all workers refuse, the healthcare system will no longer function. Solidarity is, therefore, called for.15 While duties to other patients and family members may conflict with the duty to treat a particular (contagious) patient, the duty to fellow co-workers may support it.

Like the obligation to avoid infecting others, the duty to treat should not be considered absolute (even if there were, by hypothesis, no conflicting duties). Virtually everyone denies that a healthcare worker should be expected to treat if it is known that treating would (likely) be a death sentence for the healthcare worker. But what if the risk of death for the healthcare worker was 50%, 20%, 10% or 1%? For what X should a healthcare worker be expected to treat, so long as the risk of death for the healthcare worker is less than X%? The answer presumably depends on the expected effectiveness of treatment.16 The more likely that treatment would save the patient's life, the greater the level of risk that healthcare workers should be expected to face to provide treatment (which is not to say that healthcare workers should be expected to provide treatment even when the risks are especially high). However, they should not be expected to face as much risk when treatment would likely be futile or merely palliative.",

In the context of HIV/AIDS, Daniels persuasively argued that refusal to treat AIDS patients involved invidious discrimination because the risks were less than those already routinely faced by healthcare workers.17 In the event of a flu pandemic, it will be important to assess whether or not, or the extent to which, risks exceed those which are already tolerated. Given that the duty also depends on effectiveness of treatment, evidence regarding likely efficacy of treatment against the particular strain of flu will be wanted. Early in a pandemic involving a novel strain of pathogen, however, such evidence may be unavailable. Even if it was possible to specify the limits of the duty to treat, it is unclear what expectations should be in cases involving uncertainty, i.e. about whether or not the limits to the duty to treat have actually been exceeded.",

According to this argument, younger people have stronger claims to life-saving interventions than older people because they have had fewer opportunities to experience life.22 The idea that everyone should get the chance to enjoy a normal span of years, or to live through all the stages of life, appeals to considerations of fairness.

As, other things being equal, saving a young person would generally lead to greater reduction in the burden of disease, there are straightforward utilitarian reasons for prioritizing the young. Burden of disease is usually measured in DALYs (disability adjusted life years).23 The DALY is a \u2018health gap\u2019 measure of the number of years of healthy life lost to morbidity and mortality. The earlier in life a disease kills someone, the greater the number of life years that are lost (assuming that, as in the most recent Global Burden of Disease study, age weighting is not used in DALY calculations). Other things being equal, saving a younger person rather than an older person will avert a greater number of DALYs. If (as seems plausible) distribution of resource decisions should aim at maximal disease burden reduction, then fair innings considerations could play a role in age weighting, i.e. years of life lost in early life could be weighted more heavily than years of life lost later in life when DALY calculations are made. Without going into a technical discussion of DALYs, the point being made here is that there may be two distinct important reasons for prioritizing the young: (1) saving the young will save more years of healthy life; and (2) \u2018saving one year of life for a young person is valued more than saving one year of life for an older person\u201922 (if the fair innings argument and/or the \u2018life-cycle allocation principle\u2019 is sound).",

History suggests that long-term social distancing was highly effective in American Samoa during the 1918 flu pandemic.26 As the ethical acceptability of coercive social distancing depends on evidence regarding efficacy, there is an ethical imperative to carry out more research that explores the empirical basis for these policies.",

As freedom of movement is one of the most basic rights, one might conclude that isolation and quarantine require the highest level of evidentiary justification, i.e. systematic review/meta-analysis on the Cochrane scale of evidence-based medicine.28 Although it is plausible that (other things being equal) higher levels of evidence should be attained before infringing upon the most basic rights, the magnitude of utility threatened is another relevant consideration. If anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that isolation and quarantine may be necessary to save thousands or millions of lives, and if this is all the evidence there is to go on, it may be imprudent to insist on the highest level of evidence (which would be especially difficult to come by during early stages of an epidemic involving a novel strain of disease).

If the latter entails that all other (less restrictive) measures must be tried before resorting to isolation and quarantine, this may not be feasible, because in the event of a public health emergency, there might not be time to try everything else that just might have worked. It is plausible, however, that we should use the least restrictive means that there is good reason to believe will be effective in achieving the goal in question. If there is reason to believe that voluntary quarantine would be just as effective as coercive quarantine, then we should not resort to the latter.

A related point is that those who are coerced should receive financial compensation for inconvenience, lost wages (if they are unable to work), and simply for having their liberty restricted. Coercive social distancing is only justified if it results in net benefits to society as a whole. Some of these benefits should be returned to the victims of coercive measures. In the absence of compensation, those coerced would suffer a disproportionate share of the burdens required to benefit society, and this would be unfair. Compensation is a matter of reciprocity.18 In addition to promoting fairness, a system of compensation would likely promote trust in the public health system and cooperation with public health policy.29 Given the importance of trust to the success of public health programmes, compensation may have substantial health benefits.",

This suggests that those concerned with health ethics should, in addition to engaging in philosophical analysis, play a greater role in identifying ethically important empirical questions and advocating that relevant research gets done. A message for scientists is that there are many empirical questions which are not only scientifically important but also crucial to the making of ethically sound policy.
