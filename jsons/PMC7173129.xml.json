            "text": "Antibody-based approaches to studies of the immunobiology of HIV-1, and to development of vaccines to HIV-1/AIDS, often rely on antibody-mediated inhibition (neutralization) of infection of susceptible cells. One such assay utilizes human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as targets for infection by HIV-1 [1]. In the course of examining the effects of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the PBMC assay, we discovered that two murine IgM mAbs (PIP1 and PIP4, now known as WR301 and WR304) that were initially selected for the ability to bind to phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PIP), each neutralized HIV-1 [2], [3]. In addition, we discovered that an important, but rare, broadly neutralizing human IgG mAb, known as 4E10, that had previously been reported to bind simultaneously both to a linear site on the membrane proximal external region (mper) of gp41 from HIV-1 and to cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol), also bound to PIP [2], [4]. Despite the lipid binding similarities between 4E10 and WR304, it was subsequently found that each mAb also bound to a wide variety of other types of lipids, including phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and many other phospholipids, cholesterol, glycolipids (4E10, but not WR304, bound to glucosyl ceramide and galactosyl ceramide), a sulfated glycolipid (sulfogalactosyl ceramide, also known as sulfatide), and even a glycophospholipid (lipid A, the lipid moiety of lipopolysaccharide that covers the surface of Gram negative bacteria) [5].",

            "text": "Phosphoinositides comprise a group of seven intracellular phospholipid species that are reversibly generated by phosphorylation of the precursor molecule, phosphatidylinositol (PI), at positions 3,4, and 5 of the inositol ring [6]. Although PIP and PIP2 occur on plasma membranes of cells, and although PIP2 may constitute as much as 5% or more of the total lipids of plasma membranes, all of the phosphoinositides are thought to occur exclusively on the inner (cytoplasmic) leaflets of plasma membranes and on intracellular organelles where they serve as intermediates in numerous types of intracellular signaling events [6]. Despite the absence of phosphoinositides on cell surfaces, they still remained as candidates for binding of the WR304 and 4E10 mAbs to HIV-1 because phosphoinositides are known to be important chemical constituents of HIV-1 virions [7]. This is because phosphoinositides are functionally active both during the intracellular assembly of virions in host cells and localization of gag to the plasma membrane whereby PIP2 serves as a bridge between the matrix protein and the envelope of HIV-1 [8], [9], [10], [11]. It was thus concluded that although both 4E10 and WR304 could neutralize HIV-1 in the PBMC assay without binding to any HIV-1 proteins, it seemed likely that the mAbs could bind to one or more HIV-1 lipids, even if the exact lipid binding sites, whether phosphoinositides or other lipids, remained unclear because of very broad lipid binding specificities of the mAbs.",

            "text": "Recently, a novel alternative neutralizing mechanism for anti-lipid mAbs has been proposed that does not require any direct binding of the anti-phospholipid antibodies to HIV-1. A neutralizing human mAb, CL1, was described as having binding capabilities for both cardiolipin and phosphatidylserine, but no binding to HIV-1 envelope protein, and it inhibited proliferation of CCR5-tropic, but not CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 strains in a PBMC assay [12]. In this case, release of several \u03b2-chemokines, including MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2, was observed in the PBMC culture fluid. \u03b2-Chemokines are believed to be effectors secreted by many cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, NK cells, and monocytes in the PBMC that inhibit infection by binding to CCR5, thus blocking infection with HIV-1 strains that utilize CCR5, but not those that utilize CXCR4, as a co-receptor [13]. Based on binding of CL1 to cells in the PBMC culture, it was hypothesized that CL1 bound to plasma membrane phospholipid(s) and caused secretion of \u03b2-chemokines that interfered with binding of HIV-1 to CCR5-dependent, but not to CXCR4-dependent, viruses [12]. In the present study, we explore further the lipid binding specificities of CL1, including binding to phosphoinositides, and we describe a new murine neutralizing IgG mAb (WR321) which binds only to phosphoinositides PIP and PIP2 among 19 lipids tested, but which also causes release of HIV-1-inhibitory \u03b2-chemokines by PBMC even in the absence of HIV-1.",

In contrast, WR321 bound only to PIP and to a lesser degree to PIP2. Neither of the mAbs bound to gp41 from HIV-1 or the mper peptide derived from gp41 (data not shown). These data confirm the anti-CL and anti-PS binding properties of CL1 [12], but also demonstrate that the lipid binding specificity of CL1 is relatively broad and is similar to the relatively broad lipid binding specificities of the previously reported murine mAb WR304 [5]. In contrast, we conclude that phosphoinositides represent the dominant, and probably the sole lipid binding specificities, of WR321.",

The secretion of both of these cytokines by PBMC in the presence of WR321, as shown in Fig. 3, suggests that the secretion of the \u03b2-chemokines was partly, or possibly even completely, due to binding of the both the CL1 and WR321 mAbs to phosphoinositides.

This general method has also been employed by others for producing and/or selecting mAbs to phosphoinositides [19], [20]. However, it is now apparent that considerable unexpected cross-reactivity of antibodies produced by this method can occur with other lipids [5], [21]. Despite this, the observations in the present work of the lack of cross-reactivity of WR321 with other lipids, or with peptide or protein, and previous observations with similar anti-phosphoinositide mAbs [22], demonstrate that exquisite specificities of murine mAbs for phosphoinositides can be achieved.

However, in view of the secretion of \u03b2-chemokines after incubation of intact cells with WR321 in the absence of HIV-1, this conclusion presents an interesting conundrum because of the complete absence of phosphoinositides on the outer surface of plasma membranes of non-permeabilized cells. In view of this, we propose the hypothesis that WR321 could have entered one or more of the cell types in the PBMC population, either by endocytosis, pinocytosis, or macropinocytosis, where it then exerted intracellular binding effects on the inner leaflet of plasma membranes or other intracellular organelles, resulting in the secretion of \u03b2-chemokines.",

In addition, mAbs to PIP2 that were directly microinjected into the cytoplasms of individual non-permeabilized cultured cells reportedly bound to intracellular PIP2, thereby leading to a variety of important physiological effects in various cells [20], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. Although the exact intracellular trafficking patterns and intracellular binding sites of ingested mAbs to phosphoinositides are unknown, the previous studies with microinjected mAbs to phosphoinositides that were similar to WR321 suggest that such uptake might have important biological effects. The exact mechanism(s) by which ingestion and intracellular binding of our anti-PIP mAb might have caused the secretion of \u03b2-chemokines is also not yet clear. However, we suggest the possibility that the cytoplasmic uptake of a mAb to phosphoinositides might have been a threatening event to the cell that could have represented a unique type of intracellular \u201cdanger signal\u201d. The secretion of \u03b2-chemokines induced by the mAb might then have been a reaction that was similar to other types of mechanisms linking chemokine secretion to innate and adaptive immunity [27].",
