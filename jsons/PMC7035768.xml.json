            "text": "Intubation with mechanical ventilation is a life-saving procedure for patients presenting with acute respiratory failure. However, since unnecessarily prolonged mechanical ventilation is associated with increased mortality [1, 2], weaning from the ventilator, which accounts for approximately 40\u201350% of total ventilation time [3, 4], should begin as early as possible. In order to provide structure and to safely accelerate the weaning process, a classification into six stages has been proposed [5], with clinical parameters and tests (including weaning trials) at each of the stages that may help predict successful transition to the next stage (and eventually to extubation) [6]. If a patient experiences prolonged weaning [5], undergoes multiple unsuccessful weaning trials, or has to be reintubated despite using non-invasive ventilation to prevent post-extubation respiratory failure, tracheostomy is indicated, often followed by transferal to specialized weaning and home ventilation centers [7\u201310]. At such centers, since the pathophysiological basis of prolonged weaning is an imbalance between respiratory muscle load and capacity [11, 12], the aim is to both reconditioning the respiratory pump, while at the same time reducing workload imposed during spontaneous breathing. So far, few studies have examined predictors of prolonged weaning in such patients [13\u201318].",

Patients classified as category 1 (simple weaning: patients who proceeded from initiation of weaning to successful extubation on the first attempt without difficulty) or category 2 (difficult weaning: patients who fail initial weaning and require up to three SBT or as long as 7 days from the first SBT to achieve successful weaning) were excluded from the analyses [5]. We analyzed data only from patients whose first SBT upon admission to the weaning center was performed over a period of 30 min. Furthermore, patients were excluded from our study if a tracheostomy or non-invasive home ventilation (NIV) existed before the acute illness, or if the patient was subsequently transferred to another hospital prior to completion of the weaning process (Fig. 1).\n",

In the intervals between SBT, all patients were mechanically ventilated in the assisted-controlled mode (Vivo 50, Breas Medical AB, Moelnlycke, Sweden) in order to recover from the imposed work of breathing during SBT [20].

MP can be obtained mathematically by the \u201cpower equation,\u201d derived from the original equation of motion, unifying all determining ventilator variables, or experimentally by analysis of the respiratory system pressure-volume curve (P-V curve) [22]. The energy transmitted largely serves to overcome elastic recoil and airway resistance of the respiratory system, although some dissipates into the tissue of the lungs and the thoracic cage, with the component dissipating into the tissue of the lungs believed to be responsible for the development of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [27]. In contrast, the pathophysiological basis for prolonged weaning is thought to be reduced respiratory muscle capacity [11, 12], accompanied by increased load of the respiratory pump due to changes in the mechanical properties of the lungs (infiltrates, fibrosis, emphysema) and the thoracic cage (pleural effusion, increased abdominal pressure, and anasarca of the chest wall), that may be either reversible (by therapeutic intervention) or irreversible (e.g., due to pre-existing comorbidities). Patients\u2019 measured work of breathing (WOB) during spontaneous respiration, which is identical to the mechanical power generated by respiratory muscles, has proved to be a predictor of weaning [28\u201330]; however, since WOB requires esophageal pressure measuring, the procedure is complex, impractical, and rarely used in routine practice. In contrast, energy delivered by the ventilator can be continuously calculated at the bedside and may be even directly displayed on the ventilator. Since the energy transmitted by the ventilator was found to be an independent variable related to weaning failure, corresponding to a state of chronic ventilatory insufficiency in the course of prolonged mechanical ventilation, it may at least be hypothesized, that at a particular PaCO2, the MP transferred on mechanical ventilation would be correlated to a patients\u2019 WOB. In the present study, patients in the weaning failure group experienced significantly elevated MP values, mainly due to higher values for IPAP, indicating that with increasing MP, in order to secure adequate gas exchange, the likelihood of long-term ventilator dependency increases. LTC-MP describes the energy required to dilate the lungs and thoracic cage, and the present results indicate that this is crucial in prolonged weaning. In fact, therapeutic interventions during weaning aim at improving respiratory system compliance and resistance, thereby reducing a patient\u2019s WOB. In contrast, PBW-MP relates the transmitted energy to lung volume, which appears to be critical in the development of VILI in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [27].",

This may help to explain the observed increased VR in such patients in the present study, equivalent to increased ventilatory demands, so indirectly contributing to the observed increased MP. These results are consistent with previous work, in which obesity has been identified as independently associated with failure of prolonged mechanical ventilation in tracheotomized patients treated at specialized long-term acute care facilities (LTAC) [17]. Similarly, in intubated patients, obesity is independently associated with increased extubation failure risk, and prophylactic use of non-invasive ventilation to reduce patients\u2019 WOB has proved to prevent reintubation [32].",

With increased respiratory rates, leading to dynamic hyperinflation, the FRC moves to the flat upper margin of the P-V curve. This results in increased WOB due to reduced LTC, together with reduced respiratory muscle capacity as a consequence of unfavorable pre-stretching of respiratory muscles fibers [33]. COPD as an underlying disease has already been described as a risk factor for unsuccessful weaning at LTACs [17, 34], although existing data are contradictory [8, 9]. As in patients with obesity, the presence of COPD in intubated patients is an independent risk factor for extubation failure [6], with similar recommendations for prophylactic use of NIV [35]. Both in COPD and obesity, the key predictor of increased weaning failure rate appears to be pre-existing increased WOB, accompanied by reduced respiratory muscle capacity potentially further exacerbated by factors such as controlled mechanical ventilation, sepsis, or steroids in the course of ICU treatment [36].",

So far, this variable has been assessed in a single study, in which intubated patients with a successful weaning trial had significantly lower PaCO2 values on mechanical ventilation compared to patients who failed the SBT [38]. In the present study, although the amount of ventilatory assistance (IPAP, DP, and MP) was lower in successfully weaned patients, they had lower PaCO2 values on mechanical ventilation. In addition to the lower LTC, the reason for this may be the observed reduced VR, which is an expression of a more favorable ratio of CO2 production to MP, necessary to provide adequate gas exchange. In weaning failure patients, in order to achieve comparable mean PaCO2 values, it would be necessary to adjust ventilator settings further toward a higher MP (i.e., increasing IPAP or respiratory rate), and this in turn, considering the present results, appears to be associated with unsuccessful ventilator weaning.",

Second, due to the difficulty in objectively measuring the amount of airway secretions and determining the type and frequency of different airway clearance techniques in a retrospective trial, we did not consider these important issues in terms of weaning outcome. Third, measurement of ventilator variables for calculating MP is ideally performed under deep sedation and muscle relaxation. Since patients admitted to the weaning center were neither sedated nor muscle relaxed, activation of respiratory or abdominal muscles cannot be ruled out without monitoring esophageal and gastric pressure [41]. This could either have led to an increase or decrease in VTi and minute ventilation, with a consequent distortion of LTC and MP. The same applies to activation of the diaphragm on assisted ventilation, although the proportion of assisted ventilated patients was low (16%) and not different when comparing successfully and unsuccessfully weaned patients. Furthermore, a simplified equation was used for calculation of MP in the pressure-controlled ventilation mode; however, this still seems to be sufficiently accurate for most clinical situations [24] and will probably facilitate application in routine practice.",

Individuals on prolonged mechanical ventilation should not only be classified according to underlying diseases, but also by parameters that quantify the workload imposed on respiratory muscles during spontaneous breathing. Measurement of LTC-MP could be easily implemented in routine practice and may help clinicians in guiding the weaning process (e.g., to control the degree of daily extension of spontaneous breathing) or to identify patients at high risk for weaning failure at an early stage. Finally, LTC-MP may also be useful in intubated patients as a predictor of extubation failure or the outcome of a weaning trial and may help decision-making for prophylactic use of NIV. Further prospective studies are required to confirm the present results.",
