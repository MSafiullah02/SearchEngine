PAMPs can be recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) which are present on the surface of host cells. 4 The intrinsic properties of multivalent display and highly ordered structure present in many pathogens also facilitate recognition by PAMPs, resulting in increased immunogenicity. PAMPs stimulate antigen uptake by antigen presenting cells and the subsequent presentation of antigens to cells of the adaptive immune response.

The adaptive response is also the basis for immunological memory, which is important for ensuring a fast, strong response when an infectious pathogen is encountered again. 6 Memory lymphocytes can form subsequent initiation for a rapid and immediate immune response upon reintroduction of the pathogen.

We can take advantage of these natural strategies of recognition as we develop vaccines. Classical approaches to vaccine development involve chemical inactivation of virus particles or infected tissues (termed 'killed' vaccines), attenuation of virulence during passage in tissue culture or animal hosts (termed 'live-attenuated' vaccines), or immunization with portions of the pathogen that can induce specific immune responses (termed 'subunit' vaccines). To generate vaccines against viruses, the delicate balance of protection and safety was first reached by using whole virus that was inactivated or killed. More recently, as understanding of the immune system activation has improved, it has become apparent that even small immunogenic peptides derived from a pathogen have the potential for inducing protective immunity. 7 Currently, a large number of successful vaccines are based on whole viruses, whether live-attenuated or inactivated. The first vaccine developed against smallpox by Edward Jenner in 1796, also involved the administration of less pathogenic cowpox (vaccinia) virus. 8 The method for immunization with vaccinia was crude and imprecise, the mechanism of immune protection was not well understood, and the potential for vaccine-induced illness was high.

[11] [12] [13] In spite of the success of the poliovirus and other vaccines, there are intrinsic disadvantages involved with the use of whole virus particles for immunization. 7 Live-attenuated viral vaccines are relatively unstable and difficult to deliver. The potential for genetic reversion of the attenuated strain to a more virulent form is always a concern.

Because there is no potential for replication, subunit vaccines are potentially much safer, but are often less immunogenic when expressed and purified in the absence of other viral components. An advance in this area involves the natural ability of many types of viral capsid subunits to self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs), which allows for a better mimic of the whole virus particle, and a resulting improvement in effectiveness as vaccines ( Figure 2 ). [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Further advances utilize the VLP as a platform for the attachment or display of foreign epitopes such as nonstructural viral proteins or nonviral proteins. This strategy couples delivery of the chosen antigen with the ability of the VLP to induce strong immune responses. The ease with which VLPs are often made and various antigens are attached to them makes every potential platform promising from onset. However, application of the platform in a complex system involves unique challenges and problems that may limit their progression in clinical use. Each of these approaches is discussed below, as well as summarized in Table 1 to bind and penetrate host cells. Noninfectious VLPs are inherently safer than killed or attenuated virus vaccines. In addition, due to their particulate nature, VLPs can be much more stable than soluble antigens, which have failed in many vaccine approaches. The multivalent and highly ordered structure of the VLP is not typical of host proteins, and thus constitutes a PAMP, which triggers innate immune sensing mechanisms. In addition, most VLPs encapsidate nucleic acids during their production, and these nucleic acids may stimulate particular TLRs as well. These qualities contribute to the effectiveness of VLPs as vaccines because they facilitate uptake by antigen presenting cells and long lasting CTL responses and antibody responses are possible. 23,24", "cite_spans": [{"start": 612, "end": 616, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 617, "end": 621, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 622, "end": 626, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 627, "end": 631, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 632, "end": 636, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 132, "end": 140, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 600, "end": 608, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1268, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "VACCINE STRATEGIES FOR INITIATING IMMUNE RESPONSES"}, {"text": "The two most successful VLP-based vaccines have been licensed and approved for use in humans. The first to be commercialized was the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine. HBV infection is transmitted by blood or sexual contact, and is a major cause of hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma, affecting approximately 300 million people worldwide. In the initial vaccine formulation, empty particles of small HBV-derived surface antigen (HBsAg) that are naturally made during infection with hepatitis B and are present in the blood, were obtained from infected individuals and purified. The limited quantity of antigen produced by this method led to investigation of the potential for making the particles by recombinant protein expression. Expression systems in yeast, baculovirus, and mammalian cells are often utilized because these cultures can produce large amounts of proteins in vitro.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nonenveloped VLPs"}, {"text": "In the case of HBV, vectors were prepared carrying the cDNA sequence for HBsAg, and the surface antigen proteins were expressed in recombinant yeast cell culture and VLPs formed by self-assembly. 25 studies confirmed the immunogenicity of these particles in human vaccination. 26 Inclusion of surface proteins (preS1 and preS2 proteins), which are present in the native HBV envelope at lower levels than in HBsAg, allows for immune responses in the small percentage of patients who do not respond to VLPs of HBsAg alone. [27] [28] [29] In this case, the better mimic of the authentic virion surface results in broadened effectiveness. The commercially successful vaccine, licensed in 1986, is a safe and effective example to which other vaccines are compared. The effectiveness of this vaccine has facilitated exploration into more complex issues such as administration in poorer countries where HBV is an epidemic and application of the current vaccine is limited due to cost. The most recent advances have tested the possibility of oral delivery of HBV particles that are produced in transgenic plants. 30 The second commercially available VLP-based vaccine is to human papillomavirus (HPV). An effective HPV vaccine is of particular interest because of the link of HPV infection, particularly genotypes HPV-16 and HPV-18, to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cervical cancer). 31-33 The HPV capsid consists of two proteins, L1 and L2. Expression of the L1 major capsid protein of HPV16, either alone or in combination with L2 resulted in the production of 40 nm VLPs that induced high-titer neutralizing antisera in rabbits. 34, 35 Immunizations in human females demonstrated that the HPV vaccine protected them from infection with HPV, and also reduced or prevented entirely the development of intraepithelial neoplasia. Of the control patients who received placebo, a subset was infected with HPV and some developed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The current HPV vaccine shows great promise, as it is almost completely protective against HPV types from which it is derived even in the absence of an adjuvant, and with adjuvant achieves partial protection against other phylogenetically related types. 36 This VLP vaccine is considered a breakthrough for preventing cervical cancer, and it will be interesting to observe the impact of the vaccine on cervical cancer rates in the future. Since HPV-16 has also recently been associated with oropharyngeal cancer, 37 vaccination may impact the future rates of this disease as well. As with the HBV vaccine, production and characterization of VLPs is expensive and results in higher vaccine costs. Approaches to reduce costs by expressing the L1 protein as pentameric capsomeres, or in combinations with other viral proteins, are being explored. 36 Other VLP-based vaccines are in various stages of development. 38 VLPs of hepatitis E virus (HEV), a virus thought to cause an acute severe liver disease in some individuals, were shown to be immunogenic and protective in macaques, and have now passed Phase I of clinical trials. 39,40 Experimentation with the protein requirements for HEV VLP formation has facilitated further understanding of the formation of VLPs. 41, 42 However, circumstances specific to the disease hamper the testing of protective efficacy. The clinical attack rate of HEV is low and sporadic, requiring a large number of vaccinated and control individuals to achieve any interpretable results. VLPs of Norwalk virus, a highly infectious virus that is a major cause of gastrointestinal illness, have been tested in adults and are immunogenic. 43 Strides toward an oral Norwalk virus vaccine produced in tobacco leaves and potato tubers have been successful, and oral immunization of mice resulted in production of serum and mucosal antibodies. 44, 45 In addition, a betanodavirus-based VLP vaccine has found much success in preventing viral nervous necrosis disease in fish. 46 some or all of the surface components of the virus embedded in plasma membrane. VLPs expressed in baculovirus and composed of influenza hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix structural proteins can induce production of specific antibodies in mice. 47,48 Route of entry and presence of the cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) as an adjuvant alters the immune response and affords different levels of protection. 49 In addition, although individual influenza proteins were capable of inducing protective immune responses, the use of baculovirus-expressed recombinant revealed a problem that may be an underlying problem in many VLP-based vaccines using recombinant proteins. The recombinant HA proteins were poorly immunogenic in people, perhaps due to differences in post-translational modification such as glycosylation. 47, 48 The ability of HIV to consistently and effectively evade the immune system over time makes the development of an effective vaccine to HIV particularly difficult. On the surface, a VLP vaccine may be at a disadvantage compared to current replication-based vaccine strategies because HIV-1 VLPs are similar to the wild-type viral structure, which does not elicit a protective response in infected individuals. However, modifications in the HIV VLP could advance this strategy. In addition, mucosal administration of the particles elicits strong neutralizing antibody and CTL responses. 50 Efficient induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies is thought to be an essential component for inducing protection. Nevertheless, while such antibodies have been identified in a small subset of HIV-infected patients, it is not yet possible to induce such antibodies experimentally. One significant challenge is the difficulty of producing antigens that are structurally similar to those found on the intact HIV particles. The production of an HIV VLP that confronts this problem has been attempted by mimicking the intact HIV particle containing the envelope proteins that associate with the viral gag protein core. 50-52 The focus of recent research has been on the more conserved epitopes of the HIV-1 gp-41 envelope protein. 53 Nevertheless the challenge of an efficient HIV vaccine will require further manipulation of the different VLPs and expression systems available.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 196, "end": 198, "text": "25", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 521, "end": 525, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 526, "end": 530, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 531, "end": 535, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1105, "end": 1107, "text": "30", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1630, "end": 1633, "text": "34,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1634, "end": 1636, "text": "35", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2803, "end": 2805, "text": "36", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2869, "end": 2871, "text": "38", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3224, "end": 3227, "text": "41,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3228, "end": 3230, "text": "42", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3623, "end": 3625, "text": "43", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3824, "end": 3827, "text": "44,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3828, "end": 3830, "text": "45", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4378, "end": 4380, "text": "49", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4788, "end": 4791, "text": "47,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4792, "end": 4794, "text": "48", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6114, "end": 6116, "text": "53", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nonenveloped VLPs"}, {"text": "Other VLP-based vaccines for enveloped viruses have the potential to ultimately be used in humans.

However, although the HBV core antigen (HBcAg) was shown to be strongly immunogenic after green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to the core protein and introduction resulted in robust humoral immune responses against native GFP in rabbits, the maintenance of the favorable properties of HBcAg with the addition of such a large protein remains to be determined. 68 For HIV-1, antigenic regions of the HIV envelope protein were linked to HBsAg, producing particles morphologically similar to HBcAg and which exhibited antigenic and immunogenic characteristics of both HBV and HIV. 69 The short (6 aa) yet highly conserved region of HIV-1 gp41 displayed on these particles elicited high titers of gp41-reactive antibodies in mice, however they failed to neutralize HIV in vitro. 70 This same epitope was more successful in neutralizing antibody production when presented on the influenza A vaccine platform, thus the molecular context seems to be important when considering the ability to elicit protective responses.

Two enzymatic A subunits of the AB type toxin of B. anthracis are responsible for the toxic effects. These are delivered to the cell by binding to the B subunit, termed protective antigen (PA) that binds to cell-surface receptors ANTXR1 and ANTXR2. The adenylate cyclase edema factor (EF) raises intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, and the zinc protease lethal factor (LF) cleaves mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases. 65 Once PA binds to ANTXR1 or 2, it is cleaved to form heptamers that bind EF and LF to form edema toxin and lethal toxin, respectively. The FHV particles were genetically engineered to display the PA-binding domain of anthrax receptor ANTXR2 at position 206 or 264, and the binding domain was deemed functional by its ability to bind PA and inhibit PA-cellular receptor binding and intoxication in vitro and in vivo. Since they could bind PA, the FHV-ANTXR2 particles were then tested as a multivalent scaffold for displaying the antigenic PA protein. Following immunization with the FHV-ANTXR2-PA complex, strong toxin-neutralizing antibody response along with protection against lethal toxin challenge in rats confirmed the dual-action ability for treatment and protection. 65 Interestingly, increased antibody responses and protection were observed following immunization multivalent FHV-ANTXR2-PA compared to monomeric PA alone (Figure 3 (E) and (F)). In addition, protective responses were observed after a single immunization without additional adjuvants. These results further confirm the idea that multivalency of antigen presentation facilitates effective antibody responses. The use of the FHV platform to display other large antigens is currently under investigation. HBV and T4 have also been used as platforms for display of large antigens. HBV was also used to display larger portions of Dengue virus antigens. A 395 amino acid portion of Dengue virus envelope protein type 2 (E2) is effective for priming a protective immune response. This large portion of E2 was expressed as a fusion protein with HBsAg in yeast and the resulting VLPs were purified and characterized. 118 These well-structured VLPs were shown to function as bivalent immunogens in mice. 119 The Hoc and Soc molecules on bacteriophage T4 are ideal candidates to allow the attachment of large antigens because these proteins are not integral to capsid assembly. T4 can bind to up to 155 Hoc proteins, and fusions between Hoc and either PA, LF, or EF were shown to bind to T4 and induce immune responses against all of the individual antigens, proving the concept that this scaffold could be used for display of multiple antigens simultaneously. Consistent with the FHV studies, responses against multimeric PA were higher than monomeric PA. 109 After assembly of the Soc-PA proteins on T4 phage, cleaved anthrax protective antigen heptamers were attached and served as further scaffold for binding LF [ Figure 3 (A)] 67 . Together these results indicate that VLP scaffolds have excellent potential to display antigens with complex structure, and combinations of antigens.
