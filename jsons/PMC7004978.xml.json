According to the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN), malnutrition is defined as a state of nutrition, in which a combination of varying degrees of overnutrition or undernutrition have led to changes in body composition and diminished function (www.nutritioncare.org, last accessed December 25, 2019). Data from the medicine literature have suggested that malnutrition may negatively affect the treatment outcomes of various medical conditions, such as cerebrovascular disease, heart disease, pulmonary disease, renal failure, diabetes, and cancer1\u20136. In addition, investigations in the field of general surgery have reported malnutrition as a significant risk factor for patient morbidity and mortality7\u20139. Within the orthopaedic surgery literature, the preoperative nutritional status as a predictor of surgical outcomes has recently gained attention10\u201315. In particular, for elective orthopaedic procedures, malnutrition has been reported as a significant risk factor for surgical complications. Thus, it has been reported that malnourished patients undergoing elective hip or knee arthroplasty will be at significantly higher risk for surgical complications10\u201312. Similarly, recent reports have suggested that malnourished patients undergoing elective spinal fusion are at significantly higher risk for increased length of stay, hospital readmission, surgical complications, and mortality13\u201315. Regarding surgical complications, particularly wound healing problems and infections have been emphasized to be associated with a poor nutritional status.",

Most investigations in the field of orthopaedic trauma address nutritional deficits in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery16\u201318. However, reports on young orthopaedic trauma patients with high-energy injuries remain limited. Therefore, the goals of this study are (1) to identify the prevalence of hypoalbuminemia and obesity in orthopaedic trauma patients with high-energy injuries and (2) to investigate their impact on the incidence of surgical site complications. We hypothesise that hypoalbuminemia and obesity increase the risk of surgical site complications in orthopaedic trauma patients with high-energy injuries.",

All statistical analysis was performed using Stata 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Binary variables were compared using the chi-square test. Continuous variables were compared using the Wilcoxon test. A logistic regression model was created in order to identify independent variables predicting the incidence of wound complications. The independent variables tested included age, gender, diabetes, smoking, race/ethnicity, BMI, insurance type, ASA score, illicit drug abuse, hypoalbuminaemia, open fracture, and mechanism of injury. The dependent binary variable was incidence of wound complications. First, a univariate analysis was performed to identify independent variables that demonstrated a significant difference for the incidence of wound complications. All independent variables that showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) or trended differently (p = 0.05\u20130.15) between patients with and without wound complications, respectively were included in the logistic regression model. Thus, the independent variables tested in our logistic regression model included BMI, insurance type, ASA score, and mechanism of injury.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. The data in our study was retrieved through a retrospective review. This type of data collection is inherently associated with certain limitations, arising from variable data entry into the electronic medical records. In addition, the available data on the nutritional status of patients included in this series was limited to albumin levels and BMI. Albumin has been widely established as a standard nutritional serum marker and has been used in numerous studies within the medicine, general surgery, and orthopaedic literature2,3,5,9\u201316. However, our study does not provide any information on clinical nutrition assessment scales or other nutritional serum markers that may be relevant to orthopaedic patients, such as micronutrients. Moreover, our data is limited to patients with femoral shaft fractures. A femur fracture model was chosen for the purpose of this study as we intended to capture a young orthopaedic trauma patient population with high-energy injuries. As femoral shaft fractures are typically the result of a high-energy injury, we feel that our study population appropriately represents this group of patients. However, one must be cautious when extrapolating our data to patient populations with other injury profiles. Our study identified obesity as an independent risk factor for wound complications. However, we also acknowledge that due to the relatively small sample size, our study may be underpowered to detect other significant risk factors for surgical site complications. Finally, the data recorded in this study reflects a single-institution experience. Thus, it must be assumed that prevalence and type of malnutrition is subject to geographic variations.",

            "text": "Comparing and contrasting our findings with data from the literature is challenging given the paucity of nutrition studies in this specific patient population. Ihle et al.21 reported the prevalence of malnutrition to be 22.3% in patients admitted to a German trauma center. Their patient population included both traumatic as well as elective admissions and patients were classified as malnourished using a clinical nutrition assessment scale. Regarding risk factors for malnutrition, our study identified age, female gender, diabetes, smoking, and ASA class 3 o r4 as risk factors for hypoalbuminaemia. This is consistent with previous investigations. Bohl et al.22 who reported hypoalbuminaemia to be associated with female gender as well as diabetes. In patients undergoing elective total joint arthroplasty. Furthermore, our findings are in accordance with previous investigations in patients with hip fractures which recorded an association between malnutrition and medical co-morbidities23. Lastly, poor nutritional status was significantly correlated with older age in our study, which is in line with Ihle et al., who also found their elderly patients to have a higher prevalence of malnutrition21. Our study found that obesity was a significant predictor of surgical site complications in orthopaedic trauma patients with high-energy injuries. This is in line with the experience of elective orthopaedic procedures that have reported similar results10\u201315. Our data emphasizes the urgent need for proper assessment of malnutrition in orthopaedic trauma patients during the early treatment phase.",
