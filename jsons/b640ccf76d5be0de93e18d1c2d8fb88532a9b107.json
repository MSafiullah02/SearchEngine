The mortality for penetrating injuries in the pre-PHTLS period was 8.9% (n = 9) compared with 5.6% (n = 61) for the post-PHTLS group.

            "text": "There were several studies that examined barriers and suggested strategies for optimizing implementation of developed nation emergency medical education programs. Prevalent themes were that scenarios should be tailored to the local clinical setting (Smith, 1997, 15; Tennant, 2000, 10; Young, 2008, 271) , having sufficient functioning equipment for adequate practice (Couper, 2005, 459; Tennant, 2000, 10; Young, 2008, 271) , rationalizing and using only essential equipment, anticipating higher degree of maintenance requirements to keep the equipment functioning (Young, 2008, 271) , enlisting local counterparts in local modification of course to maintain overarching themes, while adapting to local cultural settings (Bhat, 1993, 87; Smith, 1997, 15) , increasing allotted time for course to incorporate local cultural norms (Bhat, 1993, 87; Smith, 1997, 15) , minimizing comparison of practice in local setting to developed country setting (Smith, 1997, 15) , utilizing dual language slides for didactics (Smith, 1997, 15; Young, 2008, 271) . Also reported in the literature is the use of logbooks to document operational performance and patient outcomes after training. (Zafar, 2009, 449) Most studies reported positive outcomes in knowledge acquisition using cognitive assessments pre-and immediately post-training intervention (Couper, 2005, 459; Ergenekon, 2000, 225; Enweronu-Laryea, 2009 , 1308 Jabir, 2009 Jabir, ,1265 Ali, 1998 Ali, , 1192 . Baseline scores were around 50-60%, and were often lower when compared to repeat course participants (Aboutanos, 2007, 714) and developed country subjects (Ali, 1994, 695; Trevisanuto, 2007, 28) . Interestingly, multiple studies showed that after training all subjects had similar cognitive scores (overall ranging from 70-88%). (Aboutanos, 2007, 714; Ali, 1994, 695) Where specified, subject knowledge acquisition was best in the areas of basic trauma (Aboutanos, 2007, 714) and worst in CPR (Capone, 2000, 259) .",

            "text": "There have been conflicting studies when examining the efficacy of ATLS in resource limited settings. When Ariyanayagam et al, compared 6-hour mortality pre ATLS training to post ATLS training implementation, they found no change (Ariyanayagam, 1992, 72) , but during the same time period at the same hospital in Trinidad and Tobago, there was a 100% decrease in in-hospital mortality among patients with Injury Severity Score (ISS) > or = to 16 after the introduction of the ATLS program (Ali, 1993, 890) . In two studies Husum et al compared trauma patient mortality in Cambodia and Northern Iraq pre to post a low-cost modified ATLS training intervention, finding a decrease in the annual mortality rate from 23.9 % to 8.8% (Husum, 2003, 142; Husum, 2003 Husum, , 1188 . Pre-hospital life support (PHTLS) has demonstrated improvements in several studies. Following the successful demonstration on the impact of ATLS on trauma patient survival, Ali and his colleagues examined impact of PHTLS in Trinidad and Tobago and demonstrated a reduction in mortality with either penetrating (8.6% pre-PHTLS, 5.6% post-PHTLS) or blunt (18% pre-PHTLS and 12.8% post-PHTLS) injuries, as well as major disability (40% pre-PHTLS vs. 8.6% post-PHTLS) and length of stay (14.6 days pre-PHTLS vs. 8.9 days post-PHTLS) (Ali, 1997 (Ali, , 1018 . A 3-month EMT course taken by pre hospital personnel in Santa Catarina, Nuevo Leon, Mexico demonstrated a 45% reduction in severity-adjusted risk of pre-hospital death (at scene with treatment attempted, died en route, in the ED of the receiving hospital) when compared to pre-training control group. Patient overall mortality was reduced from 6.3% to 2.5%, the PHI-adjusted odds ratio for death in the after period was 0.55 (95%CI 0.30-0.99) compared with the before period (Arreola-Risa, 2007, 914) . Interestingly, there was no change in cervical or thoracic immobilization (61%), airway maneuvers (4.4 vs 2/7 for intubated for respiratory distress), or IV fluid resuscitation (9.6 to 5.0%) use of any iv fluids for Adults with SBP < 100) or scene time, between the pre and post intervention groups. After trauma team training in Tanzania, participants demonstrated high scores in scenario testing, but this result was mitigated as this checklist was not validated to assess competence (Bergman, 2008, 879) . Tchorz implemented a modified ATLS course in India and required competence in ultrasound and airway management for passing, but was limited by utilization of subjective criteria (instructor observation) (Tchorz, 2007, 373) . Additionally, this study was limited in that it eliminated other technical skills requirements such as although tube thoracostomy, central line placement and splinting due to costs, despite these being common procedures required of study subjects.",

While there was a 33% reduction in asphyxial related deaths after the training, there was no demonstrable difference in neonatal mortality rates (3.7% vs. 3.5%) between the 7,070 births prior to training and the 25,713 births after the health care staff was trained. (Deorari, 2001, 29) A significant shift towards more rational resuscitation practices was indicated by a decline in the use of chest compression and medication (p < 0.001 for each), and an increase in the use of bag and mask ventilation (p < 0.001). (Deorari, 2001, 29) Similarly, when nurses in delivery ward of teaching hospital, in Uganda were taught a self-developed course, there was no significant improvement in overall neonatal mortality, but there was improved outcomes of babies greater than 2 kg. Subgroup analysis demonstrated a reduced incidence of asphyxia as well as asphyxial related deaths. (O'Hare, 2006, 376) Conversely, when neonatal resuscitation was incorporated into Traditional Birth Attendant training in Rapiur Rani Community Development Block of India, there was 20% reduction in perinatal mortality in intervention group (49.4/1000 vs. 61.0/1000). (Kumar, 1995, 29) Although Kumar demonstrated higher proportion of resuscitation techniques utilization, the overall mortality decrease could be not attributed to a decrease in asphyxia-related deaths.

Population: auto part industrial plant employees in Brazil.Intervention: 116 exposed to brief LSFA skill demonstrations on TV. Comparator: 86 controls without TV exposure to LSFA. Outcome: Brief Videotape training of laypersons can be effective in some, but not all life saving skills, with some degree of knowledge retention at 13 months. Simulated skill performance on the evaluating nurse or manikin was tested at 1 week, 1 month, and 13 months. Over 50% of the television group performed correctly 5 of the eight skills, including positioning and hemorrhage control. Television viewing increased correct airway control performance from 5 to 25% of trainees, while it remained at 3% in the control group. CPR -ABC performance, however, was very poor in both groups.
