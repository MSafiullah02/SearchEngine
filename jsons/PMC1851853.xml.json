However, when serum from uninfected THMOG mice was transferred to wild-type recipients at the time of infection with MHV, an exacerbation of CNS disease similar to the levels found in MHV-infected THMOG mice was observed (Figure 2B). In addition, transfer of Protein-A purified antibodies from the serum of THMOG resulted in a comparable exacerbation of MHV-induced encephalitis as the serum (data not shown).

Although no difference was observed in the clinically silent encephalitis induced by 105 plaque-forming units (PFU) of Pichinde virus, an exacerbation of the CNS disease by the autoantibodies was observed in mice infected with both TMEV and CV B3 (Table 1). C57Bl/6 are genetically resistant to TMEV infection, ie, the virus replicates but does not cause detectable inflammation or demyelination,23 and as expected, no behavioral signs of acute CNS disease were seen in the control mice. However, 44% of the THMOG heterozygous animals developed a clinically evident disease, and one-half of the sick animals died within the 1st week (Table 1). Likewise, no signs of disease could be observed in any of the 2-week-old control pups infected with 103 or 104 PFU CV B3, whereas 20 or 100% of the heterozygous autoimmune mice became sick, respectively (Table 1). This was reflected by a profound difference in the weights of the two groups when injected with 104 PFU CV B3: all of the pups initially gained weight at an equal rate (111 \u00b1 3% in THMOG\u00b1 versus 108 \u00b1 4% in controls at 5 days after infection). The transgenic animals then started to grow at a slower rate and eventually lost weight, resulting in an average of 109 \u00b1 2% of their starting weight at day 10 after infection, versus 137 \u00b1 1% in the controls (P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney test). These experiments show that the adverse effects of pre-existing autoantibodies can have an impact on the outcome of a variety of viral encephalitis. They also show that exacerbation can occur over a large spectrum of clinical manifestations of encephalitis: Autoantibodies can transform a clinically silent infection into a symptomatic disease (TMEV and CV B3), transform a mild CNS pathology into a lethal one (MHV A59, 10 PFU), or accelerate the clinical course (MHV A59, 1000 PFU).",

Likewise, no sign of clinical disease was detected in such mice on infection by 100 PFU of MHV A59 via the intraperitoneal route (n = 2; data not shown), a dose that results in a clinically silent hepatitis with active viral replication for over a week in C57Bl/6 mice (R.B. and M.J.B., personal observations).

Both the frequency of perivascular cuffing and the number of infiltrating cells within inflammation areas were higher in mice with autoantibodies compared with controls (Figure 4, A\u2013E). Morphologically, the infiltrates appeared to be composed of mixed inflammatory cell populations, with numerous neutrophils being seen both in the controls and in the mice with autoantibodies (Figure 4, F\u2013G). To determine more precisely the nature of the infiltrating cells, we performed flow cytometry experiments on mononuclear cells purified from infected brains. Enumeration of the purified cells from individual brains confirmed the increased cellularity in the brains of mice with autoantibodies (Figure 4H). The presence of the autoantibodies resulted in no significant differences in the numbers of T or B lymphocytes (Figure 4I). On the contrary, the frequency of NK cells and blood-borne macrophages was somewhat more elevated in mice with autoantibodies (Figure 4I). Altogether, these results show that brain infiltration of lymphocytes, and in particular cells bearing Fc receptors, is augmented by the presence of anti-MOG antibodies during MHV A59 encephalitis.",

To evaluate the eventual additive effects of their joint presence in the CNS, we examined sections from brains and spinal cords of MHV-infected autoimmune and control mice for the presence of demyelinating lesions at 7 to 9 days after infection. The vast majority of the demyelinating areas were found in the central white matter of the cerebellum, in the brainstem, and in the region surrounding the third ventricle, both in controls and in mice with autoantibodies, but the extent of the lesions was found to be augmented in the latter group. In wild-type mice brains, small lesions were detected in a majority of the animals, but the mice with autoantibodies displayed lesions that were both more widespread in the tissue and larger in size (Figure 5A, left panel). This difference was even more pronounced in spinal cords, with only a small subset of the control mice displaying lesions at 7 to 10 days after infection [Figure 5, A (right panel) and B], whereas most animals with autoantibodies showed heavy demyelination in coronal (Figure 5A, right panel) and longitudinal (Figure 5, C and D) sections. These results show that demyelination plays a role in the enhancement of the CNS disease in our model.",

The augmented disease is transferred by serum containing the autoantibodies and is Fc receptor-mediated. In further support of this hypothesis, viral replication was similar in controls and mice with autoantibodies during the first 6 days of the infection and was only significantly higher in the autoimmune mice on day 7 after infection.

Another possible source of CNS damage can be NO,27 which has been shown to be involved in MS lesions.28 However, NO plays little role in MHV-induced demyelination, even though it can damage neurons during the infection,29,30 and iNOS-deficient mice have been reported to have a better survival rate than wild-type animals.29 In accordance with this literature, we found control iNOS KO mice to survive the infection better than the C57Bl/6 animals. However, our experiments showed that iNOS was not involved in the antibody-mediated pathology, because all of the KO mice that were transfused with autoimmune serum succumbed to the infection. On the contrary, we found that a deficiency in cellular Fc receptors Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RIII was sufficient to abrogate completely the autoantibody-mediated pathology at both clinical and histological levels. This indicates that neutrophils, macrophages, or NK cells are responsible for the autoantibody-mediated pathology. Based on these results and on the characteristics of the mononuclear infiltration in the autoimmune mice, we propose that cells of the monocyte/macrophage/microglia lineage, neutrophils, or NK cells are responsible for the autoantibody generated damage, through a mechanism that does not involve complement or iNOS release.",

The \u03b3-herpesvirus \u03b3HV-68 has been shown to provoke relapses of experimental autoimmune arthritis in mice.31 Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus and MHV each resulted in dramatic exacerbation of the pathology and mortality in a mouse model of antibody-triggered autoimmune hemolytic anemia.32 Likewise, both lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus and MHV infections also provoke a severe thrombocytopenia in mice treated with anti-platelet antibodies at otherwise nonpathogenic doses.33 To our knowledge, the present report constitutes the first description of a similar phenomenon in the CNS compartment in an animal model. Our findings are consistent with previous studies performed with human patients, which suggest a correlation between the presence of autoantibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the outcome of encephalitis. Desai et al34 reported that fatal outcome in a cohort of 72 patients with Japanese encephalitis virus infection was significantly associated to the presence of CSF autoantibodies, against neurofilament proteins in particular. Likewise, Matsui et al35 found that in a group of 14 patients with viral encephalitis of undefined etiology, three of the four patients with CNS autoantibodies were among the total of five individuals with an unfavorable outcome. Both of these studies were performed with patients enrolled at the time that pathology was declared, making it impossible to determine whether the autoantibodies existed before the CNS infection or if they appeared as a consequence of the encephalitis. Likewise, there was no way to determine whether the autoantibodies had a direct role in the unfavorable outcomes or were merely an associated marker. However, in view of the results obtained in the present study, it is very possible that the autoimmune status of those patients had an adverse effect on the evolution of their CNS disease.",

The model of an autoimmune \u201cfertile field\u201d proposes that autoreactive T cells are first generated by some infections through molecular mimicry or bystander mechanisms but may remain nonpathogenic for extended periods and that unrelated viruses or bacteria may be responsible for triggering the actual autoimmune pathology.1,4 In this model, Koch\u2019s postulates (one disease/one pathogen) are not strictly respected, which may explain why it has been so difficult to associate a single organism to a given autoimmune disease.",
