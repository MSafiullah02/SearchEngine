Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 Several cases of NMS caused by midazolam use have been reported in Japan[8], and risperidone-induced NMS has been commonly reported[9]. However, the short duration of midazolam use did not allow us to exclude it as the possible cause of NMS. Risperidone was administered in case 2 for delirium control and was discontinued earlier in case 2, on the basis of the experience of case 1 in terms of NMS.

However, the direct association of favipiravir with NMS remains unknown. In the current two cases, favipiravir was discontinued on day 10 in case 1 and on day 8 in case 2. Consequently, fever subsided in both the cases in conjunction with other therapies. The number of COVID-19 positive patients being treated with favipiravir is increasing not only in Japan, but also across the world, including countries like China and the United States [11, 12] ; therefore, further research on the association between favipiravir use and NMS development in COVID-19 patients is warranted.",
