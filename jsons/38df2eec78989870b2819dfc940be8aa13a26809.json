This family is genetically divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronavirus. The first two genera infect mammals, while the latter two spread the disease to birds [2] . To date, seven coronaviruses have been identified as human pathogens, including CoV-229E, CoV-NL63, CoV-HKU1, CoV-OC43, SARS, MERS, and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). According to phylogenetic analysis, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is located in the beta coronavirus genus. This new coronavirus causes severe respiratory tract infection and is also highly contagious [3] . The transmission route of the 2019-nCoV is mostly through close contact, respiratory droplets, and persistence of the virus on inanimate surfaces [4] . However, some studies have shown that the fecal-oral route may be a possible pathway of transmission [5, 6] . The attachment of the virus to the receptor expressed by cells is an essential step in the occurrence of persistent infection in the host. Owing to the structural similarities between spike surface glycoproteins of 2019-nCoVand SARS-CoV-2, virus entry is reportedly mediated by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [7] . Furthermore, the tissue tropism and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection would be determined by the distribution of ACE2 as a receptor. High expression of ACE2 on various tissues such as respiratory tract cells, the urinary system, and the testes can account for the involvement of several organs in SARS-CoV-2 infection [8, 9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 196, "end": 199, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 391, "end": 394, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 775, "end": 778, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 927, "end": 930, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1037, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1040, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1369, "end": 1372, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1696, "end": 1699, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1700, "end": 1702, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Owing to the lack of adequate treatment and a vaccine, as well as the asymptomatic incubation period of this emerging virus, every procedure that could rapidly and accurately detect infection is important for the management of this disease, including patient isolation and effective public health surveillance [10] .

Limitations in collecting a specimen from patients and the performance of laboratory kits mean that quantitative RT-PCR has a high specificity but a low sensitivity (60-70%) for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The low sensitivity can lead to poor identification of patients and thus increase the chance of contamination in the community [12] . Imaging, including computed tomography (CT), plays a major role in the diagnosis and assessment of the severity and progression of the disease in COVID-19 infection. An accurate and fast diagnosis of COVID-19-infected patients through a CT scan is possible with computer-aided methods such as deep learning [13] . The reported sensitivity of chest CT has been found to be more than that of RT-PCR (98% vs 71%, respectively) [14] .

Case designations are dynamic, and consequently, frontline doctors are strongly urged to seek updates from public health and infection control authorities as our understanding of this disease matures. One more important point that we should not forget in this situation is this fact that this situation confines people to a small area and limits normal activity out of doors, which may lead to increased stress levels, restlessness, and the adverse consequences of physical inactivity. Psychological and behavioral supports could be helpful for the reduction of anxiety and negative moods, which could be important for increasing resilience during this disease outbreak. Finally, it should be kept in mind that like other similar conditions, the most proper way to deal with any crisis is to be widely prepared. Up to now, it may believe that the performance of the healthcare system in nuclear medicine units is limited to radiation issues. This fact intensifies the necessity of nuclear medicine unit preparedness before an infection outbreak in addition to radiation accident. The development of an individualized management model for each nuclear medicine unit based on staffs, instruments, kind of services, crowding, physical space, hospital base unit, or outpatient clinic that could consider all managerial aspects of a crisis is of pivotal importance.
