Until we have a more complete ability to detect which of our surgical patients may be harboring the COVID-19 virus or have immunity, we should be extremely careful about proceeding with any non-emergent surgery of the chest. The article in the Journal by Huang and his colleagues from Wuhan demonstrate the insidious and devastating nature of the COVID virus in otherwise healthy patients who undergo a pulmonary lobectomy 1 . Other issues for surgeons to consider are the fact that many patients in our hospitals in the near term will have this virus making transmission to our post-operative patients a potential problem despite all conceivable precautions and if our patients have a post-operative complication that requires an ICU stay or re-intubation it is possible the hospital will not have the resources necessary to care for this patient. As the patient's doctor and surgeon we must weigh the variables and make the best recommendation for the patient since it is very difficult for a patient with cancer to put all of this into perspective. Most thoracic cancers that we operate on can be deferred for a month or so without significant consequence. If the time period will be much longer then consideration for alternative treatments to bide time until resection or in place of resection should be considered. Regardless, a low risk patient dying of an overwhelming and currently untreatable infection with a relatively high prevalence will be hard for any of us to rationalize.",
