Thus, microarrays of different carbohydrates coupled to wells of a microtiter plate have been developed, with a range and complexity such as found in naturally occurring glycans (see fig. 4 .1) (Bryan et al., 2002; Gargir, 2001) . Such glycochips should greatly facilitate the screening for lectins in biological materials, as well as the definition of their specificity. By a completely different method, lectins can be detected in situ, in tissue sections and on cells, by staining with suitably derivatized glycoproteins or Fig. 3 .1 Hemagglutination and its inhibition as a means to demonstrate the presence of lectins in seed extracts. Ground seeds (or wheat germ) were extracted with ten times their weight of phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4. In the case of soybeans, the oil was removed prior to extraction. Each well of the microtiter plate contained 50 \u00b5l of seed extract, 50 \u00b5l of a 4% suspension of rabbit erythrocytes and 50 \u00b5l of 0.2 M sugar solution in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The agglutinated erythrocytes form a carpet that covers the whole well; where no agglutination occurs, the cells form a button at the bottom of the well.

Some of the better characterized plant lectins and their specificity are listed in Table 3 .1. The majority of these have been obtained from the seeds, especially those of the dicotyledonous legumes, where they accumulate during maturation and disappear upon germination. They may constitute as much as 10% of the total seed protein, although the quantities isolated are usually lower, between 0.1-1%. Their location within the seeds differs among various plant families (R\u00fcdiger, 1998) . In seeds of the legumes, most of the lectin is localized in the cotyledons in protein bodies, subcellular organelles related to lysosomes, (Fig. 3 .4) where it may be in complex with endogenous proteins, named \"lectin binders\" (R\u00fcdiger, 1998) . In those of the Euphorbiaceae (e.g. castor bean), the endosperm is the major site where the lectins occur and here, too, they are confined mainly to protein bodies. In rhizomes of the hedge bindweed (Calystegia sepium) the lectin is in the cytoplasm (Peumans et al., 2000a) whereas in cereals, it is all in the seed embryo.",

            "text": "Most plant tissues contain a single lectin, although occasionally two (or more) lectins that differ in their sugar specificities and other properties are found in the same tissue (Peumans, W. J. et al., 2000a lectins occur in the seeds of gorse, jackfruit and Vicia cracca, while in seeds of Griffonia simplicifolia three different lectins (in addition to a number of isolectins, see below) are present. Lectins with dissimilar specificities are also found in the bark of the elderberry and the Japanese pagoda tree. In the same plant, lectins are not necessarily confined to a single tissue. Cases are known when lectins found in vegetative parts of the plant are identical with those in the seeds (e.g., the three lectins of Griffonia simplicifolia seeds are also present in leaves of the same plant) but this is not always so. For example, in Dolichos biflorus, the most extensively studied plant with respect to the distribution of lectins in various tissues, the leaves contain a lectin (DB58) homologous to that of the seed lectin (DBL), but with some differences in its fine specificity (Etzler, 1997) . In addition, a root lectin (LNP) has been found in the same plant that is distinct from the seed lectin both in amino acid composition, molecular weight, isoelectric point and specificity (Etzler et al., 1999) . Single lectins, in particular from legumes, occur occasionally as a mixture of isoforms referred to as isolectins. Typically, isolectins have a similar molecular structure, although they may differ slightly in their specificity or some physical property such as electric charge. They can, therefore, be separated by ion exchange chromatography, as found for WGA ( Fig. 3 .5), or by affinity chromatography on immobilized sugars. Some isolectins originate from distinct genes, as is the case of those of WGA (cf. Chapter 7). Others result from the differential posttranslational modifications of a single lectin gene product (Young et al., 1995b) or of the different assembly of closely related subunits. The two winged bean seed isolectins WBA-I and WBA-II differ mainly in their isoelectric points, one being acidic and the other basic, whereas the Maackia amurensis seed isolectins differ in their cell specificity, one (MAH) being a hemagglutinin and the other (MAL) having leukoagglutinating activity (i.e. the ability to agglutinate preferentially white blood cells such as lymphocytes) (Van Damme et al., 1998b) . GSL-I consists of a family of five isolectins, each a tetramer of one or two types of subunit, A and B (Fig. 3 .6) that are very similar in molecular size and amino acid composition, but differ in specificity (see 4.2.1.b). The PHA isolectins also represent a family of five tetrameric proteins with varying proportions of two classes of subunit, E and L. They differ in carbohydrate and cell specificity, as well as in biological properties: E 4 (E-PHA) is a potent hemagglutinin, L 4 (L-PHA) has leukoagglutinating activity and is a potent mitogen; the intermediate forms (E 1 L 3 , E 2 L 2 or E 3 L) possess lower levels of the above activities. Similar mixtures of isoforms are found in the seeds of Vicia villosa and in the bark of Maackia amurensis, Robinia pseudoacacia and Sophora japonica (Van Damme et al., 1998c) . In Datura stramonium seeds three isolectins are present, two of which are homodimers composed of either A or B subunits, whereas the third is a heterodimer comprised of both subunits. The two types of lectin (toxin and agglutinin) found, among others, in the seeds of Ricinus communis and of Abrus precatorius may be considered as a special case of isolectins.",

Recently, a lectin with unique carbohydrate-binding properties, including blood group-B-specificity, and high affinity for Gal\u03b13Gal and Gal\u03b13Gal\u03b24GlcNAc, but no reactivity with methyl \u03b1galactoside, has been isolated from the mushroom Marasmius oreades (Winter et al., 2002) . A galectin has been isolated from the fruiting bodies of Coprinus cinereus, the first of this lectin family found outside the animal kingdom (Cooper et al., 1997) . It is possible that when additional galactosespecific fungal lectins are sequenced, at least some of them, too, will turn out to be galectins. The above and other fungal lectins are listed in Table 3 .2. ",

During the last decade, numerous lectins have been isolated from higher animals, and their number is fast growing. Unlike plant lectins, which can be grouped in families along taxonomic lines, animal lectins often exhibit structural similarities even when derived from diverse phyla. These lectins are therefore classified largely on the basis of shared sequence characteristics of their carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) (Drickamer, 1988; Dodd & Drickamer, 2001) as discussed in detail in section 5.2. According to a recent count, at least 12 structural families of animal lectins are known to exist (Kilpatrick, 2002a) , the major ones of which are the C-type lectins (a superfamily), galectins and siglecs. However, not all animal lectins fall into any of the known families.",

Twelve mammalian galectins have been described, as well as many additional ones from other species, including birds, lower vertebrates, worms and sponges (Leffler, 2001; Rabinovich et al., 2002; Vasta et al., 1997) . They occur in nearly all cell types, both inside and outside cells, but each galectin tends to be enriched in a few cell types. Thus, galectin-4 and 6 are present almost exclusively in epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, galectin-5 is expressed in erythrocytes and galectin-7 in keratinocytes. The intracellular galectins are located in the cytosol as well as in the nucleus; the extracellular ones are either attached to the cell surface or present in the intercellular space between closely packed cells. They are also found in connective tissues, where they are usually not free but bound to N-acetyllactosamine-containing carbohydrate units of glycoproteins. C-Type lectins (so called because they require Ca 2+ for binding of sugars) have been identified in a wide range of animals (Drickamer, 1999) . They consist of three major classes -endocytic lectins, collectins and selectinsand a minor one -lecticans, and are confined to particular species, organs, or tissues (Table 3 .3). Many are associated both with the plasma membrane and with intracellular membranes. The prototype endocytic lectin is the galactosespecific mammalian hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASOGR), or hepatic binding protein (HBP), originally isolated from rabbit liver (Ashwell & Harford, 1982; Ashwell & Morell, 1974) ; similar lectins are also present in liver of man, rat and other mammals. In birds, the corresponding lectin is specific for N-acetylgalactosamine and not for galactose. The prototype of the avian lectins is that of chicken, known as chicken hepatic lectin (CHL). In all cases examined, the HBPs are located exclusively on parenchymal hepatocytes. Other endocytic C-type lectins are the fucose-and the galactosespecific receptor found on liver macrophages (Kupffer cells), and the mannose receptor of macrophages (MMR) and of hepatic endothelial cells. The collectins, so called because of their collagenous domains, are present predominantly in mammals and are the only family of C-type lectins that are soluble and not membrane bound. Examples are the serum and liver mannose binding lectins (MBLs), bovine serum conglutinin, and the pulmonary surfactant proteins A and D (SP-A and SP-D, respectively), components of the surfactant that line alveoli in the lung.",

Nuclei also contain lectins, as indicated by the specific binding of neoglycoproteins to these organelles, but only one such lectin (galectin-3, previously known as CBP35) has been isolated and characterized (Gaudin et al., 1995; Wang, L. et al., 1995) .",

The lectins are present mainly in the hemolymph and sexual organs, e.g. albumin glands and eggs, and occur also on membranes of hemocytes, cells that function in innate immunity (Vasta, 1992) . Perhaps the best known invertebrate lectins are from the garden snail, Helix pomatia, from the body wall of the slug, Limax flavus, and from the serum of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus. These and other well-characterized invertebrate lectins are listed in Table 3 .4. More exhaustive listings are found in (Kilpatrick, 2000) . Many invertebrates contain multiple lectins, several of which have been purified and characterized. Examples are the four and three lectins, respectively, of the cockroaches Periplaneta americana and Blaberus discoidalis, the two of sea urchin, and the three of sea cucumber (Cucumaria echinata) (Kilpatrick, 2000) . A bewildering array of lectins/isolectins has been detected in the Japanese horseshoe crab, some of which are antigenically distinct and exhibit different species specificity for erythrocytes.",

The starch granules (SG), cell walls (CW) and space between the spherosomes was weakly stained in a non-specific manner. The thin section was obtained in the middle of the flat part of the cotyledon. (B). At a higher magnification, labeling was very uniform within the protein bodies (PB). The thin section was obtained at the periphery of the cotyledon, opposite to the embryonic axis.
