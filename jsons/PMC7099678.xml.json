Since the lungs are the major organ affected by air pollution, lung disease diagnostics is especially important, and a variety of physical techniques employing x-rays, ultrasound and NMR-based imaging have been introduced to reveal changes in lung tissue. However, these powerful methods cannot catch the molecular signatures that could reveal disease in its early stages, when no serious physical damage to the lung tissue is yet observable. Molecular diagnostics requires samples of lung tissue, e.g. by percutaneous lung biopsy [5] or probing lung fluid obtained in a bronchoalveolar lavage procedure [6]. Both of these procedures are invasive, require certified physicians and cannot be widely used to collect samples to screen large population groups, nor can they be used frequently on the same patient to follow treatment progress.",

This rupture may happen inside the alveoli when closed alveolar sacs are opened upon inhalation, or in the bronchi and bronchioles when liquid plugs break there. Although a turbulence-induced mechanism has been discussed in the literature [11], it is not supported by solid experimental evidence.",

Holmgren et al [15] presented evidence for this by measuring the size distribution of MLFs at different tidal volumes: while the number of MLFs smaller than 100 nm was independent of the tidal volume, the concentration of MLFs larger than 500 nm increased \u223c100-fold with deep breathing. The authors interpreted this observation as the result of two independent mechanisms. One mechanism, independent of the tidal volume, is a closure mechanism operating in the alveoli, while another mechanism involving the closing and opening of terminal bronchioles contributes to the fraction of larger MLFs exhaled with a deeper breath. We may expect that such smaller and larger MLFs, born in different parts of the lungs, will have different compositions and present different sets of biomarkers. Therefore, further studies of the formation mechanisms are needed to answer many practical questions about where the MLFs are born and how representative their composition is of the lung fluid in general.",

Crackles have a correlated character: intervals between individual crackles are distributed non-randomly, proceeding in a series of avalanches upon inspiration, so that when inspiration starts, a substantial portion of the lung tissue opens at once in a cooperative manner [17]. Though multiple correlations between crackle characteristics and diseases have been explored, crackles are observed in many healthy people, and explosive opening of airways should be considered normal [16]. The production of MLFs varies substantially in different people. The concentration of exhaled MLFs is affected by the time of day, the depth of the breath, inhalation of a salty mist [18] and other factors. Yields in a series of consecutive breaths may be different: a deep inhalation opens the alveoli with the first deep breath, after which the alveoli remain open and stable [19], thereby reducing MLF production.",

Both lipids and surfactant proteins are capable of concentrating certain substances either directly, by binding them, or indirectly, by providing a hydrophobic environment where hydrophobic substances accumulate. It is expected that the relative content of such hydrophobic substances with a high partition coefficient will be shifted higher in smaller MLFs, which are surfactant-enriched.

Many self-made and commercial devices have been described, and their successful application in diagnostics has been reported [25]. The very high and extremely variable dilution of lung fluid in the EBC samples was noted by many authors as the main limitation of this collection technique [29]. Because of the high dilution, EBC probes need extremely sensitive assay techniques to detect biomarkers or require a substantial pre-concentration of samples [30] after a lengthy collection process [31].

Compared to EBC devices and filters, collection by impaction requires a powerful pump to accelerate the exhaled air. The theory behind this type of collection predicts that the higher the air speed in the jet, the smaller the MLFs that are collected [33, 34]. Typically, at the highest speed, a 50% cut-off is achieved for MLFs 300\u2013400 nm in size [33]. Thus, smaller MLFs will be underrepresented in the collected probes. Despite these limitations, impactors attract much attention because of their simplicity, ability to separate MLFs of different sizes, high collection speed, and high concentration of material washed from the substrate. Impactors have been used to analyse dry residues of MLFs by electron microscopy [10], to collect phospholipids in exhaled MLFs for analysis by mass spectrometry [35], and to collect exhaled microbes and viruses as well as their biomarkers [36, 37]. When exhaled air is mixed with air super-saturated with water vapor, the size of the MLFs may be increased upon vapor condensation to allow MLFs as small as 50 nm to be collected by impaction [37].",

To the best of our knowledge, our recent paper was the first report describing the use of an electrostatic collector to analyse dry residues of MLFs with AFM [23]. The collector allows dry residues to settle on graphite and other conducting substrates with high efficiency because it uses a special electrostatic \u2018funnel\u2019 made of a polymer mesh that directs the charged particles onto a conducting substrate to produce a highly dense deposition suitable for AFM imaging. Dry residues of individual MLFs were imaged to reveal their complex inhomogeneous internal structure and changes in shape when exposed to high humidity and to saturated chloroform vapor. Measuring the lipid volume that had spread around each particle in the chloroform vapor enabled us to prove that MLFs of different sizes are coated with a surfactant layer of similar thickness.",

It employs electrophoretic collection of charged biomarkers in a microfluidic channel formed between two dialysis membranes, one of which bears spots of antibody molecules covalently linked to the membrane surface. Once a biomarker molecule has been brought over the antibody spot by an electric field inside the 2 \u03bcm layer, the biomarker molecule becomes surrounded by highly concentrated antibody molecules. Their concentration within the 2 \u03bcm layer, \u223c1 \u03bcM [48], is much larger than a typical antibody Kd. The law of mass action makes the biomarker molecule bind one or a few antibodies independently of the biomarker concentration. Those few biomarker molecules that are caught on the spots can then be detected with magnetic beads coated with a secondary antibody. This method makes it possible to bypass the limited affinity of receptor molecules and discover just a few hundred protein molecules in a 50\u2013100 \u03bcL probe within 3\u20135 min [47].",

Due to the extremely low concentration of biomarkers, the probes were also subjected to pre-concentration. Several drawbacks of this conventional approach to analysis of MLFs should be emphasized. First, certain biomarkers from a limited infection zone are diluted with multiple household proteins from MLFs emerging from a \u2018healthy\u2019 lung. Numerous household proteins might interfere with the immunoassay and the assay of DNA biomarkers by PCR analysis. Second, it is impossible to determine in the whole probe what fraction of MLFs (big or small) bears useful biomarkers. Third, it is impossible to attribute a combination of different biomarkers to a certain fraction of MLFs. Such considerations prompted us to suggest an alternative approach to the analysis of biomarkers in which the biomarkers are analysed in individual MLFs.",
