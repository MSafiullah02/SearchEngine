Adaptation by the global community as a unit is vital to cope with the effects of increasing populations, global warming/climate change, the chemical, biological, and physical impacts on life-sustaining ecosystems, and competition for life sustaining and economically important natural resources. The latter include water, food, energy, metal ores, industrial minerals, and wood. Within this framework, it is necessary to adapt as well to changes in local and regional physical conditions brought on by natural and anthropogenic hazards, by health threats of epidemic or pandemic reach, by social conditions such as conflicts driven by religious and ethnic fanaticism, and by tribalism and clan ties.",

A grand part of the growth is taking place in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East that together already accounts for a 2014 population of 5.9 billion of the 7.2 billion people worldwide. Conversely, populations are contracting or stable in most of Western and Eastern Europe, and Japan. Together with the United States that has a stable population, this latter group today is home to the other 1.3 billion people. Thus, although there are two population situations to adapt to, both have common problems of sustainability to address.",

            "text": "The principal problems with growing populations do not involve space although population density is a problem unto itself for reasons discussed in previous chapters. The main problems are how to nourish people with food and water. The chronic malnutrition that about 1 billion people suffered from in 2013 is likely to grow in number in some regions due to global warming/climate change because humans cannot adapt to less food if they are already at subsistence rations. For example, the 2012 population in sub-Saharan Africa is 902 million people. The population is projected to increase to about 1.25 billion in 2030, an increase of about 38 %. Within the same time frame, the United Nations estimates that acreage under maize cultivation in the region will decline by 40 % because of heat and drought brought on by climate change. The loss of arable land for food production can be countered in sub-Saharan Africa if marker assisted hybridization of maize or maize genetically modified to withstand heat and drought come onto the seed market together with modified seeds for other food staples and if African nations that do not now accept GMO seeds do so in the future. If not, nations favored for food production by climate change will have a moral obligation to provide food staples to people in nations with declining food production at accessible costs based on their economies. It is clear that what happens in sub-Saharan Africa and other regions with declining cultivation acreage or that will bear other effects of climate change (e.g., drought, shifting rain patterns) will affect the rest of the worldwide community politically, economically, and socially. The earth\u2019s problems that associate with global warming/ climate change will be further discussed in the last section of this chapter.",

Chemically or biologically polluted water does not serve these ends. If ingested, contaminated water can result in sickness as discussed in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-09686-5_2. Water stokes industry and manufacturing as well, thus keeping economies in many countries contributing to a population\u2019s well-being by providing employment, goods, and services. Ideally, these businesses contribute their fair share to a tax base that supports social needs (e.g., education, healthcare, maintenance of infrastructure). Factory owners adapt and plan against water shortages by having a water recycling system in place but may also slow or stop production until operational water conditions return. Citizens with a reliable water supply can adapt to periods of water shortage by limiting use according to mandates by government officials but still have water for basic daily needs. However, persons in nations with a chronic per capita water shortage may not have this option to serve their daily needs unless water is imported or new water sources are found (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-09686-5_2). If imported water is not an option to meet immediate essential needs, an alternative adaptation for people (and animals) is to try to reach a location where water would be available to them. With growing populations, per capita water availability is greatly diminished (Table 10.1007/978-3-319-09686-5_2), water shortages become endemic, and people are at risk of existing at subsistence levels or dying. Most at risk from the lack of a basic water ration are pregnant women, infants, young children, and old people. Water wars are a future possibility as nations battle for their peoples\u2019 survival unless political differences are set aside and projects are supported to develop and share water sources. In a welcome effort, Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinian Authority signed a memorandum of understanding in the World Bank, December 2013, with specific aims: (1) produce millions of cubic meters of drinking water for a water-deficient region; (2) pipe 200 million cubic meters of water annually ~180 km (110 mi) from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea; (3) build a desalination plant at Aqaba that would supply water to Aqaba and Eilat; (4) the Israeli Water Utility would supply 20\u201330 million cubic meters of drinking water to the Palestinian Authority for the West Bank population at a reduced cost; and (5) there would be an inflow of water to slow and in the future perhaps abate and reverse the shrinking of the Dead Sea. Funding for the estimated $400 million, 5-year project will come from the World Bank, donor nations, and philanthropic groups.",

Competition can force economic wars among national and multinational corporations for the resources necessary to provide goods and services and thus drive up prices for resources. Industries and manufacturing units that cannot compete economically for natural resources will shut down, thus contributing to unemployment and downturns in economies because of falling domestic demand. To keep order in the increasingly interdependent world economy, accommodation for shared natural resources (or substitutes for them) at affordable prices is the adaptationnecessary.

This brain power has been cultivated at excellent universities in developing countries, often times at little or no cost to students (e.g., in medicine, science, engineering, economics, the arts) who attend and graduate in increasing numbers. Where there are too many well-educated professionals but lack of employment opportunities for them in their fields of expertise, educated people have the option of relocating to another country that can nurture and use the expertise. Many adapt to the employment problem by taking up this option. This may mean moving from a developing country to a developed country or from a less developed country to a developing or developed country. Ultimately, this loss of citizens with special skills can hurt a country. To counter this brain drain or reverse it, a country can adapt by investing in its future to create programs and conditions that keep talented professionals home, or if they have emigrated, entice them to return. China and India are examples of countries that have successfully taken this tact.",

Adaptation to diversity and the multicultural experiences it brings to a community is often not a comfortable change. The antipathy of some in a host country is based on slowness of the immigrants to learn the language and inability of host country citizens to understand what immigrants are saying among themselves. This makes citizens feel uneasy. Some view immigrants as a threat to their own or a family member\u2019s employment or advancement. Race difference is a factor that some cannot readily adapt to as is ethnicity with its traditions and customs unfamiliar to the general public. Religion can be divisive if adherents to its beliefs engage in acts of hatred detrimental to the host country fueled by fundamentalists and zealots who interpret religious writings as giving them license to commit crimes or absolving them of the crimes. Sadly, many citizens paint an entire religious community with the taint of the relatively few evildoers. Adaptation to diversity is essential for our earth\u2019s citizenry with joint efforts by all to resolve worldwide issues (e.g., global warming/climate change) so as to become the keys to providing a sound future for coming generations.

            "text": "In areas prone to earthquakes, we know that earthquakes do not kill and injure people but that collapsing buildings and infrastructure do. Earthquakes are not predictable so that there is no adaptation by a timely evacuation to minimize deaths and injury. However, building structures to make them more earthquake resistant can save lives, reduce injuries, and protect property. Thus, after a high-magnitude earthquake, forensic engineering teams come to assess the damage and determine where and why damage and destruction took place within the context of the magnitude of an earthquake, the type of motion it originated (shaking, jarring, rolling), its duration, the area it affected, and the geologic properties of rocks underlying structures\u2019 foundations. Hazard assessment teams also evaluate other factors that contributed to additional damage such as ruptured gas lines that feed fires and ruptured water lines that inhibit fire control. The engineers establish how construction can be improved in the future in terms of construction techniques and materials to prevent the types of collapses and utility failures they investigated. Municipalities revise building codes accordingly to direct reconstruction and future building projects. Where possible, structures that withstood an earthquake with minor or no visible damage should be retrofitted to improve their resistance to the next \u201cbig one.\u201d With each event, we gain more data on how to better construct earthquake-resistant structures and alter building codes to more stringent specifications. In theory, this adaptationto an irregularly recurring global event is good, but in practice it is most applicable to nations with the economic resources for reconstruction according to revised building codes and where there is no corruption to allow a bypass of the code. The same can be stated for retrofitting to give more resistance to earthquakes to existing structures. Many developed nations and nations rich in commodity exports (e.g., oil) have a moral obligation to donate funds, material, and expertise to help citizens in economically disadvantaged nations recover from a destructive earthquake. Some commodity-rich and economically sound nations do not do so directly, whereas others, big and small, rally to help disaster victims. For example, immediately after megatyphoon Haiyan devastated many regions in the central Philippines in 2013, Israel sent 250 medical doctors and nurses and field hospitals to help Philippine citizens recover from the impacts of the typhoon.",

However, this activity does not always result in an eruption. A marked increase in measurements and observations, especially the low-frequency seismic activity, suggests that an eruption is imminent. Adaptation to living and working on or near a volcano means investing in equipment to monitor volcanic activity and listening to alerts from scientists monitoring its activity and being ready to evacuate by gathering important papers and precious mementos and prepared to load into transportation for evacuation to safe locations. Governments adapt by charging geologists to map out areas considered as high-, moderate-, and low-hazard zones in the volcano environs. Geologists do this by studying rocks deposited from past eruptions and assessments of the topography. Municipalities then pass zoning regulations applicable to the hazard level.",

            "text": "Governments have adapted to repeated periodic flooding in areas by creating flood control systems described in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-09686-5_4. Dams hold water during times of heavy and/or extended rainfall and release any overflow into channels that move water away from urban or rural population centers. Levees increase the volume of water that can move through a channel, thereby keeping it from spreading into populated areas and cultivated farmland. For smaller waterways that flow through cities, municipalities may invest in deepening, widening, and straightening channels as well as erecting walls so that more water can flow through the area more rapidly without coming out of a channel. Governments define zones on flood plains according to a recurrence interval of damaging floods (e.g., 100 years) as being off limits for residential and factory/plant construction. As much as we plan to adjust to living in an area prone to flooding, there is always the possibility of a megaevent that can overcome in situ control systems. Therefore, as described Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-09686-5_4, governments adapt to this possibility by installing flood prediction equipment in drainage basins to provide warning to those at risk from rising and sometimes raging waters. The warning gives people time to gather important documents and personal treasures and evacuate to safe areas. The apparent increase in the frequency and magnitude of storms and resulting flooding in recent years is thought by many weather scientists to be related to global warming and the increased amount of moisture in the atmosphere from warmer oceans that gathers in clouds and precipitates during storms. This will be discussed further in this chapter.",

Some municipalities adapt to repeated, sometimes seasonal, times of short-term drought by storing a 3\u20136 month water supply in surface or underground reservoirs during periods of normal precipitation that can be tapped (conservatively) as needed. Others may plan to move water via pipes or water tankers from where it is plentiful to where drought conditions exist. Otherwise, to survive, people move as best they can to where they have access to water. In instances of years long drought, crops and livestock and other life forms may be lost. Heat waves can kill. Adaptation to heat wave conditions means that water has to be available to people to avoid dehydration. Where possible, homes should have air-conditioning or fans to keep people comfortable and municipalities should have cooling centers to which people can go. Personnel should check on senior citizens and escort them to cooling centers if necessary. Clearly, economically advantaged nations have the resources to give support to citizens during natural hazards such as these. These nations, international organizations, and NGOs have a moral obligation to help economically disadvantaged nations as is possible when hazard conditions such as these threaten populations.",

            "text": "The most extreme of weather conditions that can injure and kill people and destroy housing and infrastructure are tropical storms that evolve into violent hurricanes (typhoons, monsoons) by increasing wind speeds and sucking up moisture (water) as they track across oceans toward land. When these storms make landfall, they drive storm surges that can wreak havoc onshore communities, and as they move inland precipitate heavy rains that cause life-threatening and destructive flooding. These violent storms are destructive to coastal populations and island nations and have regional reach inland as they move along paths until they finally spend their energy or move out to sea. On November 8, 2013, the typhoon named Haiyan, the strongest recorded typhoon ever to make landfall smashed into the central Philippines killing more than 2,600 people, injuring about 12,500, and displacing almost 600,000 people. There was a 4-m (~13 ft) storm surge driven by winds measured at over 312 km/h (195 mi/h) with gusts reaching 380 km/h (235 mi/h). The typhoon flattened the city of Tacloban that was home to 200,000 residents, and there was major flooding inland. The weather alerts led to a government call for evacuation away from the predicted path of the storm, and about 1 million people followed the evacuation warning, surely saving many lives. Access to aid typhoon-ravaged areas was difficult, and there were shortages of water, food, and medical care for many evacuees for several days. The Philippine central government and local officials were not prepared to deal with a storm of this magnitude but help started arriving from many nations worldwide. There was a post-event concern of attending to sanitation needs of survivors to prevent outbreaks of diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever, hepatitis, and dysentery. If the Philippine government had adapted by adopting better policies with respect to response to high-category typhoons in addition to the call for evacuation, the impact of Haiyan would have been ameliorated. One would hope that this deficiency would be dealt with to limit the effects of future like disasters.",

Homeowners adapt to hurricanes by securing roofing with additional nails or special fasteners as a retrofit precaution and by boarding up windows on structures before an incoming storm hits. Governments have adapted to the onslaught of violent high-energy storms by constructing seawalls of varying designs and heights to protect population centers by damping the force of storm surges. In China, for example, a seawall 6.72 m (~22 ft) in height and that has been heightened in the past protects Shanghai from the full damaging effects of high-category typhoons. As a result of rising sea level, the Shanghai seawall and other that protect coastal cities from being flooded by surges from high-energy tropical storms will have to be heightened to afford a greater degree of protection to people and property.",

One may adapt to living in an area with a history of wildfires in two ways, neither of which is practical or promises 100 % protection. First would be to clear an area of vegetation in a 30-m (100 ft) swath around a dwelling or site for building. Second would be to build with nonflammable materials so that embers propelled during a wildfire could not ignite a structure. Adaptation to the advance of a wildfire would be to heed warnings to evacuate carrying a prepared case with important documents and other items of personal value. To delay evacuation by going back to retrieve something from then home can be fatal as it was for two people in a recent (June, 2013) wildfire that destroyed almost 500 homes in Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA.",

In the case of a primary or triggered hazard that happens with little or no warning (e.g., an earthquake, a tsunami, a volcanic mud flow), search and rescue teams should be ready to move in soon after dangerous conditions ease and they can move with safety. There should be medical attention to treat injured survivors, and stations set up as soon as possible to provide water, food, and other essentials available to those that survived with little or no physical hurt.

As noted in earlier chapters, during the past century, measurements show that the earth has warmed by ~0.8 \u00b0C (~1.44 \u00b0F). Global warming is an ongoing process that is attributed in grand part to a slow but continuous and increasing buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The greenhouse gas most associated with global warming is carbon dioxide (CO2). A plot of the increase of CO2 content in the atmosphere with time against the increase in global temperature shows an excellent correlation of one with the other. Additional lesser contributors include methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (NO2), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). With the beginning of the industrial revolution and the increased use of coal as the principal energy source, the content of CO2 in the atmosphere was 280 parts per million (0.028 %). The combustion of coal and later oil (petroleum) and natural gas emits CO2 to the atmosphere. Initially, and for many years thereafter, the added greenhouse gases were taken up by vegetation for photosynthesis and was also absorbed by the oceans and other water bodies. This kept the atmosphere CO2 close to the 280 ppm pre-industrial level. However, with increased industrialization, the need for electrical power, and the use of internal combustion engines, the amount of CO2 generated was greater than what could be absorbed by nature and the content of CO2 in the atmosphere increased. During June 2013, its concentration reached more than 398 ppm, an increase of over 40 % over the pre-industrial concentration (Scripps Institute of Oceanography Mauna Loa measurement). The increasing CO2 content, other greenhouse gases, aerosols, and particles acted as a media that admitted sunlight (heat energy) to the earth\u2019s surface but did not let all of the heat escape back into the atmosphere. This abets global warming. In the past two to three decades, the rush to industrialization in developing countries (e.g., China, India, and Brazil) and their growing power needs and vehicular use has thwarted the implementation of international agreements to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants, other industrial and manufacturing operations, and the transportation sector.",

            "text": "A direct consequence of global warming is sea level rise (SLR) caused by the progressive melting of icecaps and ice sheets in Greenland, the Arctic, and Antarctica, and of mountain glaciers in the Himalayas, the Alps, the Rocky Mountains, and the Andes. The ~20-cm (~8 in) sea level rise during the past century may see a rise of another ~50 cm (~20 in)\u20131 m (~39 in) during this twenty-first century. One-third of the rise would be from the expansion of warmer sea water, one-third from icecap and ice sheet melt, and one-third from mountain glacier melt [2]. In 2012, other researchers used computer models on existing data and proposed that 50 % of sea level rise between 1903 and 2007 was from glacial melt [3]. Following the same line of investigation, other scientists studied satellite data and ground measurements from Alaska, the Canadian Arctic, Greenland, the southern Andes, the Himalayas, and other high mountains of Asia and estimated that glacier contributions to sea level rise from 2003 to 2009 was 29 % and together with ice sheet melt explained 60 % of SLR [4]. A publication in 2012 estimated that ocean thermal expansion 0\u2013300 m deep and 300\u2013700 m deep contributed up to 35 % to sea level rise [5]. These latter two estimations are in line with the IPCC prediction for melting ice and ocean thermal expansion contribution to the estimated rise of sea level by the end of the century [2]. With a rise in sea level, marine waters encroach on land. As the rise continues, possibly at an increasing rate, it threatens habitation in lowlying islands, coastal villages and farmland in lowlying zones, and heavily populated cities worldwide settled on inshore terrain close to sea level (e.g., Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, Manila, Miami, New York, Boston, Buenos Aires, London, Rotterdam).",

As explained in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-09686-5_7, the warmer surface water releases more water vapor with heat energy into the atmosphere. When the water vapor molecules condense in clouds, heat energy is released. This energy gives more force to tropical storms as they form, track to shore, and move inland, or storms that move close to and along a coast. These storms may transition to hurricanes (typhoons, monsoons) with the violent winds that cause destruction, and heavy rainfall that triggers flooding if they move onto land. We recognize that rising sea level means that tropical storms that impact a coast with storm surges have a farther reach inland with their destructive energy that is more pronounced when the surge occurs at high tide. The surges also saturate farmland they reach with salt water that harms crops. They also carry salt water into fresh water marshes and ponds, thus disrupting ecosystems there. The increase in the number of these extreme weather events and the increase in violence and destruction they wreak on land compared with like weather events in the recent past (e.g., during the past 30 years) strongly suggest that they are fueled to a significant degree by global warming.",

The move is possible in some cases where land is available, but such a move is not economically feasible. One practical but costly adaptation to mitigate encroachment from sea level rise and the effects of tropical storm surges is to surround cities at risk within place seawalls 2\u20133 m higher than recorded high tides or higher depending on historical records and contemporary published data. The walls can have a concave configuration so that surging waves lose energy when their lower parts hit and are curled back on themselves damping some wave energy or there can be a different configuration best for the site(s) to be protected. Similarly, gates buried at strategic locations where there is ship access to consider can be built to be hydraulically driven so that they can rise from a near shore seabed site to mitigate the effects of storm surges. Both techniques have been used at different global locations.",

Second, pregnant women should not be vaccinated except when there is an outbreak of the disease. Third, people with a strong allergy to egg protein or those with a marked immunodeficiency or with a thymus problem should not receive the vaccine [11].",

There is no vaccine against malaria, but one is undergoing a clinical trial in seven African nations with results expected in 2014. A use or no use decision as a control method for malaria will be made in 2015. Promising results from an early-stage clinical trial of an unconventional vaccine prepared with live, weakened sporozoites of the malaria parasite were published in 2013. Plasmodium falciparum was given to healthy 18\u201345 year-old volunteers intravenously. The volunteers were grouped to receive 2\u20136 doses and subsequently exposed to bite by five mosquitoes carrying the parasite. None of the six that received five doses were infected with malaria. Three of the 12 that received four doses became infected, whereas 16 of the 17 that received lower doses became infected. Of 12 that received no vaccine, 11 became infected. Those that became infected were treated with malarial drugs and cured. Clearly, higher dosages give protection against infection by malaria [12]. More research and extensive clinical trials are necessary to determine how children respond to the vaccine with adjusted dosages and whether the results from early-stage trial are reproducible in larger volunteer populations. If the results of additional clinical trials go well, the hurdle of producing enough vaccine and adapting it to injection has to be faced.",

In addition to sub-Saharan Africa, populations in Asia (especially India and the Greater Mekong region) and Latin America suffer from the disease. The effort to deal with the disease that is preventable and curable now centers on control and treatment to reduce the number of cases. In 2010, the WHO reported that there were 219 million cases and 660,000 deaths (with an uncertainty range of 490,000\u2013836,000). In a 2012 report, researchers suggested that the number of deaths was understated and that their computer model gave a figure for 2010 almost double, 1,238,000 deaths (95 % uncertainty interval of 929,000\u20131,685,000) [13]. The WHO stood by its figure stating that much of the data in the cited study were based on verbal testimony of how people had died, not on laboratory diagnosis of samples. Either figure represents too many deaths from the disease and have to be reduced. Mosquito control is the adaptation that can reduce the transmission of the disease greatly. This includes personal protection by use of proper clothing and/or the application of mosquito repellent, the use of long-lasting insecticidal (pyrethroids treated) nets to kill mosquitos and prevent nighttime bites, and indoor residual spraying (remains effective for months). Those people infected can be treated with oral artemisinin monotherapy followed by a second drug. Failure to complete the treatment as prescribed leaves parasites in a person\u2019s blood. No other antimalarial treatment is available so that parasite resistance could become a serious problem. For visitors to a malaria region, antimalarial drugs taken before, during, and after a trip can protect them from the disease. Many countries in tropical and subtropical areas have used the above-cited strategies and others to work toward the elimination of malaria. Malaria eradication is the goal of the WHO [14].",

The disease can kill if it evolves to severe dengue. It is endemic in Latin America and Asia where most cases now occur. Since the 1970s, the sickness has spread to more than 100 countries putting about 35 % of the world\u2019s 2013 population (2.5 billion people) at risk. Dengue fever is especially endemic to urban/semi-urban environments. Humans are the main carrier of the virus. After a mosquito bites an infected person, each subsequent bite by the infected mosquito creates another carrier. A mosquito can bite many people each time it feeds. In the Americas alone, there were 1.6 billion cases of dengue fever reported in 2010 with 49,000 being severe dengue. There is no vaccination against dengue fever, but research continues to develop one. The main treatment for afflicted persons is to keep them hydrated. Adaptation to deal with slowing or stopping the spread of dengue fever involves three main tracks in addition to spraying insecticide to kill mosquitos. The best control method to prevent the transmission of the virus is to deprive mosquitos of sites with shallow, standing water where they can lay eggs and multiply. Control can be improved if communities cover and clean water storage containers regularly, and use proven insecticides on them as necessary. Finally, individual protection such as the use of mosquito repellants and insecticide-impregnated bed nets can help reduce the incidence of dengue fever as it has with malaria [15]. Although controls are known, they are not always applied because of economics and other factors that prevent access to protection methods. The result is that the number of cases of dengue fever reported continues to grow globally. As populations increase in urban locations, the incidence of dengue fever can be expected to increase as well unless strict controls are enforced until a safe and cost-effective vaccine is developed. A positive aspect of the dengue fever problem is that recovery from one serotype of the virus gives immunity for life. However, there are four serotypes of the infectious virus so that recovery from one leaves a person susceptible to the others [15].",

It is a parasitic illness that evolves after the bite of a blood-feeding triatomine bug, often on the face, where it defecates close by leaving parasite-bearing feces. Parasites access the body when the feces are inadvertently smeared into the bite, the eyes, the mouth, or any skin lesion. The parasites circulate in the blood expressing their presence as a purplish swelling of one eyelid or as a skin lesion. There are several other symptoms as well in this acute stage of the illness, but these may be absent or mild. If diagnosed early during this stage, Chagas disease is treatable. The parasite is killed with the medicines benznodazole and nifurtimox taken for 2 months. There are limitations as to who can take these medicines (e.g., not by pregnant women or people with kidney or liver problems). The untreated sickness can cause cardiac alterations and digestive problems that show up 20\u201340 years after an untreated infection. Chagas disease can be spread by blood transfusion and by organ transplant, making blood screening for the parasite essential before a procedure. It can also pass to a fetus from an infected woman. There is no vaccination against the illness so that control of the vector (Triatomine sp.) is necessary. The controls adapted by many municipalities include insecticide spraying inside a home, the use of treated bed nets, and hygiene practices that protect food, its preparation, and its storage before eating it [16]. The sickness may recur if control practices become lax. Chagas disease is spreading as populations emigrate from Latin America to northern countries. Blood screening of visitors or immigrants from the countries where Chagas is endemic may be necessary, and treatment followed by an infected individual before a host country issues an entrance visa. This would prevent the ingress and possible spread of Chagas.",

In addition, improvement of vaccines that are available but that are not completely effective in terms of protection or the length of time they are effective should be a priority in pharmaceutical and biotechnology laboratories. Scientists presented a fine review of the status of vaccine research from the design and development of vaccines to discussion of vaccines and infectious diseases (e.g., HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, pneumococcal disease, and influenza) [17]. They also discuss vaccines against enteric infections and viral diseases of livestock as well as vaccines against non-infectious diseases (e.g., cancer) and against chronic non-infectious diseases. Continued and repeated education classes on how to prevent the transmission of diseases and free supplies of materials that work to this end (e.g., insecticide-treated bed netting, male and female condoms) are essential to reducing the prevalence and incidence of diseases as are safe water and uncontaminated food. As new medicines or combinations of medicines are developed, tested, and found to be effective in controlling diseases, they become part of the protocol for either curing disease or controlling disease to reduce transmission while allowing persons to carry on with their lives. In these times of easy and rapid migration, one wonders whether screening of visitors or immigrants for diseases known to be endemic or active in the countries or regions from which they come should be required so as to prevent a carrier from infecting others and spreading a disease (e.g., Chagas disease, cholera, tuberculosis). This was done at airports during the SARS scare for people leaving or entering a country (e.g., China) and likely limited the transmission of the SARS virus and spread of the disease.",

Adapting to this reality and planning ahead makes it possible to deal with and stem an incipient outbreak of disease before it is transmitted and spread to the general population. This becomes essential when there is a future disease outbreak in large, dense populations in tropical and subtropical urban centers as well as those in regions warmed and humidified by climate change to subtropical and tropical settings. Remember that urban populations worldwide, especially in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, are where much of the global population growth will take place during the next few generations. Under these conditions, diseases can spread rapidly in many ways. These include from bites of vectors, by respired droplets after an infected person coughs or sneezes, and by touching surfaces bearing viruses, bacteria, or parasites. Diseases are also spread by ingestion of contaminated water and/or tainted food, and by other methods of infection transmission.
