Amplified DNA fragments, which encoded the C-terminal 22 amino acids of the 3A-like region plus the entire 3B VPg and 3C region, were digested with BamHI and SmaI restriction enzymes and cloned into the corresponding sites of pGEX-2TK (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Since the GST fusion protein contains the 3A/3B and 3B/3C cleavage sites, it should be cleaved into three proteins, GST-3a, 3B VPg and 3C-like protease, when E. coli cells were transformed with the wild-type plasmid (Fig. 1).\n",

Proteins were extracted as described above. The GST-2TK-Pro fusion proteins were purified by passing the cell extracts through the Glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare). For assays of the protease activity, fluorogenic peptides were synthesized by Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). The sequence of the peptides is NMA-Glu-Phe-Gln-Met-Gln-Gly-Gln-Val-Lys(DNP)-D-Arg-D-Arg, which includes the sequence between 2C and 3A proteins of Chiba virus. The fluorescence of NMA (2-(N-methylamino)benzoyl) moiety, which is quenched by DNP (2,4-dinitrophenyl) moiety when undigested, increases when the peptide bond between Gln and Gly is cleaved by the 3C-like protease. The fluorescence was monitored with the Hitachi F-7000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan) (excitation wavelength, 340 nm; emission wavelength, 440 nm). The protease activity was assayed in 300 \u00b5l of 20 mM Bis-Tris-Propane\u2013HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 5 \u00b5M purified GST-2TK-Pro proteins and 10 \u00b5M fluorogenic peptides at 37\u00b0C.

The peptides were dissolved in DMSO and stored at \u221230\u00b0C. The stock solution of the peptides was added in the assay mixture so that the final concentration of DMSO was below 1%. To calculate the amount of the cleaved substrates, the fluorescence intensity of the reference compound mixture [NMA-labelled FRETS-25-STD1 and DNP-labelled FRETS-25-STD2 (Peptide Institute, Inc.)] at each concentration (5, 10, 20, 40 or 70 \u00b5M) was measured and compared with the amount of change in the fluorescence accompanied by enzyme reaction. The kinetic constants were calculated by plotting the initial rate of the proteolysis versus the concentration of peptides.",

This identical mutation was introduced into pGEX-2TK-3aBC and the E54A mutant proteins were expressed. Again, as shown in Fig. 2A, the E54A mutation did not affect the cleavage. Furthermore, it was surprising that most of the Glu54 mutants retained the significant proteolytic activity as judged by the expression in E. coli cells (Fig. 2A). Based mainly on the results of the GST binding assay, the effects of the mutations could be roughly grouped into five categories (Fig. 2B): (i) mutations that gave a level of activity comparable to that of the wild-type, which consisted of Ala, Cys, Asp, Gly, Gln and Ser; (ii) mutations that affected the activity slightly and left a small amount of the GST-3aB intermediate, which consisted of His, Met and Asn; (iii) mutation that markedly affected the activity and resulted in very small amounts of the GST-3aB intermediate and GST-3a, which consisted of Trp; (iv) mutations that affected the processing of the GST-3aB intermediate to GST-3a and 3B VPg, which consisted of Ile, Leu and Pro; and (v) mutations that inactivated the enzyme completely, which consisted of Phe, Lys, Arg, Thr, Val and Tyr.

The E54N mutant, which had the neutral amide version of an aspartate, also showed relatively high activity with the GST-3aB intermediate remaining (Fig. 3A). These results indicate that the ability to form a hydrogen bond with His30 is important for the amino acid at position 54, rather than the negative charge. In contrast, as shown in the previous paper (11), the E54A mutant also retained high activity comparable to that of the wild-type, although only small amounts of the GST-3aB, 3BC intermediate and parental GST-3aBC protein were detected (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the E54C, E54G and E54S mutants, having a small amino acid residue at position 54, exhibited the wild-type activity (western blot data not shown). In these small amino acid mutants, it is possible that a water molecule is located between His30 and the side chain of the amino acid at position 54 and interacts with the imidazole ring of His30. This idea would be supported by the fact that a water molecule interacts with His41 corresponding to His30 of norovirus proteases since the coronavirus main protease (3C-like protease) possesses Val84 at a position equivalent to Glu54 of norovirus proteases (16).\n",

Also, both the E54L mutant (a leucine has a side chain with the same volume as an isoleucine, but a methyl is attached to the C\u03b3 atom.) and the E54P mutant showed the activity similar to that of the E54I mutant. It is notable that the activity of these three mutants was limited because the fused parental GST-3aBC was cleaved into GST-3aB and 3C-like protease, but the GST-3aB intermediate was very rarely cleaved into GST-3a and 3B VPg (Figs 2 and 3). These results indicate that the 3C-like protease having E54I, E54L or E54P mutation is active in the precursor form, but is almost inactive in the mature form. It is interesting that no 3BC intermediate was produced for these three mutants (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the 3B/3C cleavage precedes the 3A/3B cleavage, and that the precursor form might be subtly different from the mature form of the 3C-like protease, at least at its catalytic centre. After cleavage, the conformation of the E54I, E54L or E54P protease might be locked, so that the proteases no longer exert the catalysis, although the precise mechanism is unknown. There is another possibility, namely, that the residue at position 54 is involved in or affects substrate recognition. However, this seems rather unlikely, since Glu54 is far from the substrate according to the model of substrate binding to the 3C-like protease (12).",

This result is not surprising in light of the fact that human cytomegalovirus serine protease possesses a His\u2013His\u2013Ser catalytic triad (17, 18). In the wild-type norovirus 3C-like protease, a deprotonated, negatively charged side chain of Glu54 interacts with an imidazole ring of His30, which makes the enzyme favourable for the catalysis (12, 13).

Therefore, they are often called serine-like cysteine proteases. This fact easily leads us to consider the possibility that norovirus 3C-like proteases adopt the mechanism of the proteolysis including a thiolate\u2013imidazolium ion-pair, as indicated by studies on papain, a typical cysteine protease (19, 20). It has been suggested that the rhinovirus 2A protease, one of the chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteases, has a thiolate\u2013imidazolium ion-pair as a catalytic component (21). However, Asp38, a third member of the catalytic triad, of the poliovirus 2A protease, which is closely related to the rhinovirus 2A protease, could be replaced with Glu (22), but not with Ala (23). Thus, norovirus 3C-like proteases are more tolerant than picornavirus 2A proteases to the mutations of the third member carboxylate. On the other hand, some reports have contradicted the possibility that the viral 3C and 3C-like proteases involve a thiolate\u2013imidazolium ion-pair catalytic mechanism (24, 25). Further kinetics studies will be needed to determine as to which mechanism of proteolysis is adoped by norovirus 3C-like proteases, a general base catalytic mechanism or a thiolate\u2013imidazolium ion-pair catalytic mechanism. In any case, it should be noted that norovirus 3C-like proteases can afford to accommodate various amino acids at position 54 for exerting the proteolysis.",

That is, only the Asp54 and Gln54 mutations supported the proteolysis in the Ser139 background, and the 17 other kinds of mutations did not (Fig. 4). As judged by the amount of the GST-3aB intermediate left behind (Fig. 4B), the activity of the E54Q,C139S mutant was slightly less than that of the E54D,C139S mutant, which in turn was slightly less than that of the parental C139S single mutant, suggesting that a carboxylate was preferable for position 54 in the C139S background. The Gln54 residue would provide a pair of electrons that is able to orient the imidazole ring of His30. In contrast, the E54N,C139S mutant showed no proteolytic activity. This was probably because the asparagine side chain was shorter than the glutamine side chain by a carbon atom, resulting in a failure in the operative interaction with His30. As for the E54D,C139S mutant, the Asp54 residue, although an aspartate has a side chain of a size similar to that of an asparagine, would be able to provide a strong negative charge so as to interact with His30. This kind of amino acid requirement for the third member is similar to that in chymotrypsin, in which the Asn mutant of Asp102 was severely defective in the proteolysis (26).\n",

In particular, it was remarkable in the Ala, Cys, Gly and Ser mutations. These mutations were negligible in the wild-type protease, while they were inactivating mutations in the C139S mutant protease. If the Cys139 SH and the Ser139 OH were functionally equivalent during the proteolysis, the effect of the Glu54 mutations would be identical. This was not the case. These experimental results suggest that the Cys139 SH is not functionally equivalent to the Ser139 OH.",

This is why the Cys SH is more ionizable than the Ser OH and is easily deprotonated to be a thiolate. A thiolate is a much better nucleophile than the Ser OH. There is room for argument with regard to the state of the SH group of Cys139 in norovirus 3C-like proteases, but even if the Cys SH is not deprotonated and the thiol is a nucleophile, a proton will be readily withdrawn by His30 upon a nucleophilic attack to a carbonyl carbon of the substrate. It is therefore possible that the proteolysis occurs without a large contribution of an amino acid at position 54 in the wild-type Cys139 background, while in the Ser139 background, the ability for an amino acid at position 54 to interact effectively with His30 is required, so that the residue at position 54 enhances the nucleophilicity of a hydroxyl group of the Ser139 residue.",

Since the 2C/3A junction was rapidly cleaved when the ORF1 polyproteins were produced in mammalian cells (5), we chose the peptide including the 2C/3A junction for the in vitro assay. The wild-type GST-2TK-Pro protein cleaved the 2C/3A peptide effectively, and the kcat value of the cleavage by the wild-type protease was 0.63 s\u22121 with the Km value of 0.53 mM (Table 2). The GST protein derived from the pGEX-2TK vector had no proteolytic activity (data not shown). Therefore, the increase in the fluorescence observed in the assay for the GST-2TK-Pro protein can be attributed to the protease moiety of the fusion. On the other hand, the purified His-tagged 3C-like protease showed only 1% proteolytic activity of the GST-2TK-Pro fusion protein (data not shown). Since at least the GST moiety does not seem to interfere with the protease activity, the GST-2TK-Pro fusion protein was used for in vitro assays, and the effects of mutations of Glu54 and Cys139 were analysed.\n",

Among these five Glu54 single mutant proteases, the E54D and E54Q mutant proteases had the highest protease activity, being 20\u201325% activity of the wild-type protease (Table 3). This suggests that the capability of forming a hydrogen bond with His30 is important for the activity. However, we were unable to determine the kinetic constants for these five mutants, even the E54D and E54Q mutants, because the rate of the proteolysis was already saturated at the lowest substrate concentration (5 \u00b5M) that was tested and because the activity of mutant proteases tended to be lowered in the higher concentration of the substrate (data not shown). These results indicate that a glutamate is the most appropriate residue at position 54, but clearly several kinds of amino acid residues are permissible at position 54 in order to exert the protease activity.\n",

In the presence of 10 \u00b5M substrate and 5 \u00b5M protease, the C139S mutant showed about 20% activity of the wild-type (Table 3), indicating that the C139S mutant retained relatively high proteolytic activity. Addition of the E54D or E54Q mutation to the C139S mutant decreased the activity (Table 3), being about 30% of the parental C139S single mutant. The degree of the decrease in the activity was almost the same as the effect of the E54D or E54Q mutation on the wild-type protease.

Although the mechanism of the proteolysis remains unclear and further in vitro analyses would be required, there is an intriguing possibility that norovirus 3C-like proteases adopt the papain-like mechanism involving a thiolate\u2013imidazolium ion pair, despite the fact that they are related structurally to chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. It is also noteworthy that the 3B/3C cleavage appeared to precede the 3A/3B cleavage in the proteolysis, as judged by the cleavage events by the E54I, E54L and E54P mutant fusion proteins. If the cleavage at both the 3A/3B and 3B/3C sites occurs in trans (intermolecularly), these two sites are thought to be equivalent against the attack of the 3C-like protease moiety. However, this idea should be denied by the results of the E54I, E54L and E54P mutants. Although these three mutant proteases are active at least in the precursor form, only the GST-3aB intermediate and the 3C-like protease were produced. This indicates that the 3B/3C cleavage event occurs in the manner different from the 3A/3B cleavage event, suggesting the cis (intramolecular) event at the 3B/3C site. Released E54I, E54L and E54P mutant 3C-like proteases were inactive probably because the side chain at position 54 sterically hindered the further proteolytic reaction. These results led us to assume that the spatial location of position 54 might vary depending on the 3B/3C cleavage event. The elucidation of the crystal structure of the 3BC intermediate or GST-3aBC fusion protein will be one of the ways of knowing how the 3B/3C site is cleaved by the protease.",
