Diversion of resources will be planned (eg, cancelling elective surgery and outpatient procedures for chronic disease management) and unplanned (eg, medication shortages due to panic buying and inaccessibility of remaining healthcare options during movement restrictions). Longer-term, healthcare workers are likely to be at higher risk of lasting psychological morbidity based on evidence from the 2002 to 2003 SARS epidemic. 33 The effect of the pandemic on pain burden will be differentially distributed across and within populations, depending on population characteristics emerging as determinants of the pandemic, including older age, population density, socioeconomic gradient, smoking prevalence, levels of chronic disease morbidity, availability of diagnostic testing, and access to health care. Some of these characteristics are also associated with higher levels of chronic pain prevalence and burden (eg, older age, socioeconomic status, smoking prevalence, chronic disease comorbidity, and access to health care). 5 Therefore, populations with higher existing pain burden are more likely to experience higher incidence of COVID-19 infections, greater disruption to their usual healthcare access, and worse downstream consequences of abruptly altered health care. In addition, some at-risk population subgroups also have poor access to technologies used in remote care. 48 Prevention of chronic pain within populations currently depends on best practice management of acute pain and early recognition of the risk of progression to chronic pain. 6 Drivers of acute pain burden include injury-related pain and treatment-related pain (eg, after surgery). Social isolation measures will directly influence the number and type of injuries experienced within populations (eg, fewer road traffic and workplace accidents, increases in conflict/interpersonal violence, and domestic injuries). Changes in the overall volume and type of surgery (more emergency and high acuity elective surgery) are occurring as health systems pivot to respond to the pandemic. Preventing chronic pain is complex at the best of times, but in a global health pandemic, risk factors for pain morbidity and mortality will be magnified.",

When people with chronic pain are denied assessment and treatment, their condition can worsen significantly; spontaneous recovery is rare. People living with chronic pain have the largest global morbidity, measured by years lived in disability. 44 People waiting for assessment often report severe levels of pain that interfere with their ability to function, and reports of severe pain are associated with more severe levels of depression in 50% and suicidal thinking in 34.6%. 10 Children and adolescents also report high symptom burden when awaiting evaluation. 43 Furthermore, people waiting over 6 months for assessment experience deteriorating healthrelated quality of life, increased pain, and increased depression. 30 The risks of harm from undertreatment can be exacerbated further by the risk of harm from inappropriate treatment. In many countries, most notably the United States and Canada, chronic pain management is practiced in the shadow of a crisis of the oversupply and overuse of opioids. 47 Given that best practice for prevention of opioid harms is unclear, referral to pain professionals for pain medicine management is common. 4 In the United States, few pain clinics can care for high volumes of patients, and referring everyone for opioid stewardship is unrealistic. 11 In North America, we already see an increase in serious mental health problems as some turn to illicit sources of opioids, while others suffer in silence. 24 Not treating chronic pain will have consequences for individuals, healthcare systems, and providers in the short-and long-term, increasing quantity, severity, and complexity of need.",

In general, the evidence is similar to that from primary care studies and is cautiously optimistic but recognizes barriers to implementation, unforeseen harm, and potential for inequity in access and use. 17, 21, 31, 39 Most innovation has been in the development of internetdelivered therapies for people with chronic pain. Many remotely delivered programs can be accessed directly and have minimal requirements. In children and adolescents with mixed chronic pain (eg, sickle cell disease, musculoskeletal pain, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and headache), remote psychological therapies delivered through the internet or mobile applications show small beneficial effects for reducing pain intensity, including headache severity, after treatment, but not maintained at followup. 20 The first Cochrane systematic review of technological interventions for chronic pain in adults found 15 studies with 2000 participants. 18 Several systematic reviews have been published since. 7, 13, 32, 46 Reviews identify small to moderate reductions in pain, disability, and distress in intervention groups compared with any control (including active, standard care, or waitlist control). 7, 32 Unsurprisingly, when compared with only active control (eg, face-to-face therapies), no difference in treatment effect was found between remote and in-person therapies. 32 Remotely delivered physical exercise interventions are also available, with benefits comparable with usual care for reducing pain and beneficial compared with no treatment. 1 Although promising, there are concerns related to the evidence underlying remote therapies; relatively few studies assessed for harm, and dropout can be substantial. Access and engagement are important to track and report, particularly as disadvantaged groups use technology less (eg, older adults and disabled people). 2 \"Therapeutic alliance\" is important but may be more challenging to establish, foster, and maintain remotely. That said, a large trial delivering psychological therapy through an online pain course showed improvement in pain, disability, and emotional functioning compared with waiting list but few differences between groups with varying amounts of therapist contact. 15 Understanding who struggles to engage and use eHealth provision is crucial to maximise effectiveness, as are concerns about privacy, transparency (eg, therapist-generated vs automated messages), and training needs of staff accustomed to face-to-face working.

Problem solve with patients to find a time when they are free from caring responsibilities, when privacy is possible, and that does not conflict with their partner's remote work. In the case of child or adolescent patients, help to structure the session to allow time with both the child and parent. Whenever multiple people are in the room, ask for introductions of all present. 4. Complementary resources: Identify the remote intervention options available to the patient, which may include a combination of pure self-help (eg, books, online materials, web-based intervention, and smartphone app), and/or remote sessions with the healthcare provider. Use an \"information prescription\" to identify a self-help recommendation and refer the patient to use it. 5. Reinforce positives: Remote sessions provide an opportunity for healthcare providers to positively reinforce patients' self-management efforts. One of the best ways to do this is to ask for details about strategy use (eg, what strategies seem to work, where and when did you use the strategy, and what was the outcome). Ask patients about how they motivated themselves to use that strategy and how things went differently when they used it. If patients are using self-help online interventions, ask patients specifically what part of the online programme or app they have reached and how they have been using the strategies.",
