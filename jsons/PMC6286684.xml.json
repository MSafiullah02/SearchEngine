Type I IFNs are represented by IFN\u2010\u03b1 and \u2010\u03b2, type II by IFN\u2010\u03b3, and type III by IFN\u2010\u03bb family.2 IFN\u2010\u03bb family consists of four members, IFN\u2010\u03bb1, IFN\u2010\u03bb2, IFN\u2010\u03bb3 and the newly discovered IFN\u2010\u03bb4 that is coded by four functional IFN\u2010\u03bb (IFNL) genes, IFNL1, \u20102, \u20103 and \u20104, respectively. IFN\u2010\u03bb1, 2 and 3 are highly similar to each other in the amino\u2010acid sequences. The amino\u2010acid identity between IFNL1 and IFNL2/3 is ~81%, and the identity between IFNL2 and IFNL3 is ~96%.3 IFNL4 is most similar to IFNL3 compared to IFNL1 and IFNL2, but even that similarity is still very low, IFNL4 has only 29.1% amino\u2010acid identity with IFNL3.4 They have similar residues in the area that is known to interact with the primary receptor of IFN\u2010\u03bbs (IFN\u2010\u03bb R1) but differ in the region of IFNL3 that interacts with the second chain of the IFN\u2010\u03bb receptor complex, IL\u201010R2.4\n",

The IFNL4\u2010\u0394G allele generates a functional IFN\u2010\u03bb4 protein p179 (179 aa) by introducing a frameshift mutation that enables transcription, and the homozygous TT genotype creates a premature stop codon and thus knockouts this gene. IFN\u2010\u03bb4 expresses in a small fraction of Asian and about half of European populations, but in most of Africans.4 Genetic studies have demonstrated that IFNL4\u2010TT allele has a strong positive correlation with HCV clearance, treatment outcome of HCV infection, and innate resistance to HIV infection, on the contrary, IFNL4\u2010\u0394G allele is associated with the impairment of HCV clearance, and unfavourable clinical and immunological status in HIV/HCV co\u2010infected subjects.4, 5, 6 But there was also evidence supported that IFNL4 genotype is not associated with the antiviral interferon\u2010stimulated genes (ISGs) expression and HIV load in chronic HIV infection.7\n",

Macrophages were treated with or without IFN\u2010\u03bb4 (500 ng/mL) during or after the incubation with HIV Bal strain. Cells were washed 3 times, and fresh DMEM with 5% FCS and IFN\u2010\u03bb4 (500 ng/mL) was added to the cell cultures. IFN\u2010\u03bb1 (100ng/mL) was used as a positive control.

Sheep IgG (5 \u03bcg/mL) was used as a negative control. Supernatant was collected for HIV RT activity analysis at day 3 post\u2010treatment. Results are representative of three experiments with cells from three donors. HIV RT activities were compared between the group treated with IFN\u2010\u03bb4 alone and the other groups. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01",
