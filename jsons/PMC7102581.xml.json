Replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are ORF1a/b would be proteolytic cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) which are involved in the transcription and replication of the virus.9 In addition, the ORF3b encoded a completely novel short protein without an exact function. The new ORF8 likely encodes a secreted protein formed by an alpha-helix, followed by betasheets that contain six strands that have no known functional domain or motif similarly.9 The S gene of the 2019-nCoV has less than 75% sequence identity to those of the two CoVs, bat SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVZXC21 and ZC45) and human SARS-CoV.14 Similarly, the spike glycoprotein encoded by the S genes of the 2019-nCoV was longer than that of the SARS-CoV.12\n,\n14 The spike protein, composed of S1 and S2 domain, was crucial to the determine host tropism and transmission capacity through the mediation of receptor binding and membrane fusion.12 Among these, the S2 subunit of the 2019-nCoV is highly conserved and has a 99% identity with that of SARS-CoV.12 The receptor-binding domain, is commonly located in the C-terminal domain of S1 to directly contact the human receptor. Although, the S1 domain of the 2019-nCoV only has approximately 70% identity with SARS-CoV, homology modelling revealed that the 2019-nCoV has a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV.9\n,\n12 Notably, Zhou et al. found that the 2019-nCoV just like SARS-Cov may also use ACE2 as an entry receptor in the ACE2-expressing cells, and the majority of which are type II alveolar cells (AT2) in human lung.14\n,\n15 Therefore, further investigations are needed to determine whether ACE2 targeting drugs would be effective for the treatment of 2019-nCoV.",

Tian et al. reported for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human mAb, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV receptor binding domain.34 Therefore, CR3022 may be developed to prevent and treat new coronavirus infection. Additionally, The janus kinase inhibitor baricitinib, which can disrupt receptor mediated endocytosis and interrupt the passage of the virus into cells, was identified to reduce the ability of the virus to infect lung cells and be a potential treatment for 2019-nCoV.35\n",

Retrospective analysis showed that most deaths of the CoVs infection patients were due to severe pneumonia.2\n,\n5 Previous studies indicated that viral evasion of host maladjusted immune responses are believed to play critical roles in acute lung injury (ALI), in addition to CoVs-induced direct cytopathic effects.5 Indeed, changes of some immune index have been detected in the CoVs infection patients, such as lymphopenia, monocytosis and elevated cytokine levels.2\n,\n5\n,\n25 The treatment of corticosteroids may reduce the risk of lung inflammation but also delay CoVs clearance in addition to other side effects.36, 37, 38 Thus, the topic of corticosteroid use in patients with CoVs has been a matter of debate for years. The available clinical data tends to argue for no net benefit derived from corticosteroids in the treatment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.38, 39, 40 Recently, the study of the largest case series of 2019-nCoV from Wuhan showed that there was no effective outcomes were observed with usage of varied dose of methylprednisolone.25\n",
