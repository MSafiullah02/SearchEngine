The questionnaire contained 32 questions divided into four sections: general farm information, incidence/record keeping/treatment, on\u2010farm risk factors, and data collection and evaluation (survey available on request from corresponding author). Dichotomous questions were used because of their simplicity to answer and the responses were coded for statistical analysis. Each returned questionnaire was given a farm number based on the farm address. Farmers who did not wish to be identified were able to remove their address from the returned questionnaire, but these farmers were then removed from the risk factor study.",

The average morbidity of 4.5% was substantially lower than in other studies, in which it ranged from 10% to 34%, and the mortality rate of 0.2% was low but within the previously reported range of 0.1\u20136%.3, 5, 13 However, as in other studies, there was a significant variation among farms in both morbidity (0\u201380%) and consequent mortality (0\u2013100%). It is most likely that producers in the current survey underestimated the actual morbidity, which is underpinned by the average mortality of 1.7% in the subgroup of only 13 out of the 76 affected farms (Table 1) on which the producer recorded the number of calves affected and the number that died from scours. It is also possible that not all farmers correctly understood the terms \u2018morbidity\u2019 and \u2018mortality\u2019 as this terminology is not used daily by farmers. Therefore the words \u2018affected\u2019 and \u2018death\u2019 should have been used instead. Given that almost 35% of producers on affected farms reported unexplained and sudden death of calves, the relatively low incidence of scours observed in this study may have been the result of misdiagnosis. Pathological confirmation of the diagnosis was not regularly performed, with only one producer having laboratory data available . Financial constraints and logistic difficulties are possible reasons for this. On the unaffected farms, one in six producers reported dead calves without a diagnosis and identified them as \u2018unexplained death\u2019. For these producers, pathology would be an important diagnostic tool and the results used to improve treatment/and prevention protocols in future calving periods.",

A study of 73 farms estimated the mean cost per calf death as US$216, of which US$208 was attributed to the potential value of the calf and an additional US$8 for veterinary costs, drugs, producer's labour and carcase disposal.7 Another study estimated the mean\u2010per\u2010cow increase in net income for a beef herd could be US$7.44, US$14.93 and US$22.42 for morbidity and mortality reductions of 20%, 405, and 60%, respectively.15 The study by Gunn et al. reported the cost of calf scours ranged from AUD$0.50\u2013$68.60, with a mean cost of AUD$18.70 per breeding cow.2 In another study, scours during the neonatal period resulted in a significant weight loss (10.7 kg) between birth and weaning compared with healthy calves,14 so even the 4.5% incidence in the examined beef herds equates to a substantial financial loss.",

            "text": "The risk factors included in this study were carefully selected from other studies and although there are differences in climate and management systems, the findings suggest a minimal number of significant factors. Biosecurity\u2010related practices of buying cattle from saleyards or other properties did not result in any difference. The use of a quarantine paddock, which was equally applied on both affected and unaffected farms, also made no difference. However, biosecurity is a main priority in all animal health programs and potentially the main source of new infections on farms. Additional mineral supply, wintering cows and heifers in the same paddock or vaccinating against common disease did not differ between the two groups, with the exception of clostridial diseases. For animal\u2010related factors, only the presence of multiple breeds and of mothering problems/weak calves were found to be significant. Possible reasons why commonly known risk factors did not apply to the situation in NSW could be the different environment and management systems compared with overseas studies. Most of the farms in the current study are mixed farming systems (56.5%), have winter cows and heifers in different paddocks (73.4%) and segregate them for calving in separate paddocks (79.5%). Shelter for young calves is not likely to be an important factor because the most common pathogens associated with scours are bovine rotavirus and C. parvum,1 but would be more effective if E. coli was an important issue. Poor drainage in the nursing area is not very likely to be an important factor, as this is not a commonly used practice on beef farms in New South Wales. Milk production, an important selection trait within the Australian beef industry, is also not an issue, as more than 90% of the producers indicated that the milk production of their cows was good to very good.",

            "text": "The two most common pathogens detected in this and other studies are bovine rotavirus and C. parvum\n1, 4, 9 and each pathogen requires a different management approach. A correct diagnosis would help in developing a plan for this or next year's calving season and prevent or treat new cases in the current season. The results of the final regression model indicated that unexplained or sudden death of calves was associated with affected farms. A possible explanation could be the time between infection and death of the calf. We focused on the period between birth and 14 days of age, which is when the pathogens related to calf scours can cause death very quickly and if not observed by the farmer it will be recorded as a \u2018sudden\u2019 or \u2018unexplained\u2019 death of a calf. Besides time, the criteria used to identify affected calves could be an issue. The fact that only a small proportion of farmers recorded information on scours and just one farmer submitted samples to a laboratory might indicate that the criteria for identifying affected calves are insufficient. Therefore, factors such as \u2018monitoring\u2019 and \u2018criteria to identify affected calves\u2019 might be areas of focus in both future research and advice given to farmers to control or prevent calf scours. The other significant factor, single or multiple breeds, can be related to the management system of the farm. Each breed requires its own optimal management system. Managing several breeds instead of one can cause suboptimal conditions for each breed, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality rates in the calves. Overall, it can be concluded that the morbidity and mortality associated with calf scours on southern NSW beef farms is low compared with other studies but with significant variation among farms. Under\u2010reporting, the high non\u2010response rate and incorrect diagnosis could have confounded these findings. Many risk factors found to be associated with scours in overseas studies did not apply to the farms investigated in the current study. Still the question remains, which additional questions could have been included that could help to explain the difference between affected and unaffected farms? With hindsight, questions regarding the frequency and methods of monitoring calves during the calving season and the criteria used by farmers to identify an affected calf should have been included. The main recommendations from this study include improving the monitoring and diagnosis of calf scours to identify common pathogens and to investigate causes of neonatal deaths. This information could then be used to develop farm\u2010specific management protocols for the effective treatment of neonatal calf scours in New South Wales. Possible methods to improve the submission rate of faecal samples would be to inform farmers more about the financial impact of calf scours and develop sampling kits, including ice packs, that are easy to use on farms and can be directly transported from the farm to laboratory.",
