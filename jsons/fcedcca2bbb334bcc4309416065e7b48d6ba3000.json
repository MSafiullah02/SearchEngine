Therefore, continuous monitoring of IBV genotypes and lineages recently circulating in chickens worldwide is essential. In this study, we characterized the complete S1 gene from 120 IBVs circulating in chickens in Thailand from 2014 to 2016. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete S1 gene of 120 Thai IBVs revealed that the 2014-2016 Thai IBVs were divided into 3 lineages (GI-1, GI-13, and GI-19) and a novel IBV variant. Our results also showed that GI-19 lineage has become the predominant lineage of IBV circulating in chicken flocks in Thailand from 2014 to 2016. It is interesting to note that a novel IBV variant, which was genetically different from the established IBV lineages, was identified in this study. The recombination analysis demonstrated that this novel IBV variant was a recombinant virus, which was originated from the GI-19 and GI-13 lineage viruses. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the circulation of different lineages of IBV and the presence of a novel recombinant IBV variant in chicken flocks in Thailand.

The S1 gene of this novel variant was genetically different from the established IBV lineages. It is well known that S1 protein plays an important role in protective immunity because it is involved in the induction of virusneutralizing antibodies. Therefore, the amino acid mutations in S1 protein of novel IBV variants can potentially affect the host immune response against other IBV strains as well as the protective efficacy of classic IBV vaccines (Jackwood, 2012; Jackwood et al., 2012) . Several previous studies demonstrated that no cross reactivity was detected between novel IBV variants containing the genetic changes in S1 gene and classic IBV vaccine strains (Yan et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2019) . Based on our field observation, higher mortality rates were observed in farms where the novel IBV variant was isolated (5.56-16.8%) than other farms where commonly circulated GI-19 viruses (Thai QX-like IBVs) were isolated (1.48-4.5%), although the vaccination program used in these farms was similar. This indicates reduced protective efficacy of the currently used IBV vaccines against novel IBV variant and the potential enhanced virulence of this variant in infected chickens. However, the characteristics of the antigenicity, pathogenicity, tissue tropism, and complete genome of this novel variant remain unknown and require further investigation.

Corresponding to this finding, the genetic recombination between field and vaccine strains was also frequently detected in several countries (Moreno et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018) . In this study, Thai QX-like field strains were isolated from Massachusetts-and 4/91-vaccinated diseased chickens. As a result, this novel IBV variant might have been generated by recombination resulting from cocirculation of Thai QX-like field strains and 4/91 vaccine-like strains. This indicates that vaccination with ineffective live-attenuated IBV vaccines may generate an environment where coinfection between circulating field and vaccine strains can increase the possibility of recombination. However, no evidence of recombination between field and Massachusetts vaccine-like strains was found in this study, although this vaccine has been extensively used to control IBV in Thailand. This may be related to the shorter persistence and shedding of Massachusetts vaccine in chickens, which might decrease the possibility of recombination between this vaccine and field strains (Bijlenga et al., 2004) . Besides S1 gene, it is known that genetic recombination of IBV can occur throughout the entire genome of IBV (Thor et al., 2011) . Further studies on recombination analysis based on other genes of this novel recombinant variant should be conducted to provide more information on the genetic characteristic of this variant.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 333, "end": 354, "text": "(Moreno et al., 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 355, "end": 371, "text": "Xu et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1257, "end": 1280, "text": "(Bijlenga et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1392, "end": 1411, "text": "(Thor et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, our data collectively demonstrate the circulation of different lineages of IBV and the presence of a novel recombinant IBV variant originating from GI-19 and GI-13 lineage viruses in chicken flocks in Thailand.
