Novel training models proposed in this work aim to address various aspects of interest in the artificial intelligence applications domain. Topics discussed include data imputation, semi-supervised labelling and synthetic instance simulation when using sparse training data. Innovative semi-supervised ensemble learning paradigms are proposed focusing on labelling threshold selection and stringency of classification confidence levels. A regression-correlation combination (RCC) data imputation method is also introduced for handling of partially complete training data. Results presented in this work show data imputation precision improvement over benchmark value replacement using proposed RCC on 70% of test cases. Proposed novel incremental transductive models such as ITSVM have provided interesting findings based on threshold constraints outperforming standard SVM application on 21% of test cases and can be applied with alternative environment-based epidemic disease domains. The proposed incremental transductive ensemble approach model enables the combination of complimentary algorithms to provide labelling for unlabelled vector density instances. Liberal (LTA) and strict training approaches provided varied results with LTA outperforming Stacking ensemble on 29.1% of test cases. Proposed novel synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) equilibrium approach has yielded subtle classification performance increases which can be further interrogated to assess classification performance and efficiency relationships with synthetic instance generation.",

Artificial intelligence applications for addressing disease preparation and control have yielded promising results in recent years. Promising techniques in the bioinformatics domain include using remote sensing (RS) and earth observation (EO) techniques to provide ways in which to investigate land characteristics remotely [2] . These RS and EO methods help to reach some of the most rural localities and provide early risk warning to those in remote areas that would have been extremely difficult previously. EO methods enable the construction of geographical information systems (GIS) that can provide detailed mapping of at-risk areas. These mapped areas can be dissected more efficiently to extract the required environment information for assessment [3] . Epidemic diseases are defined as those which spread rapidly and at the same time therefore it is crucial to investigate potential indicators of transmission likelihood in a given area for providing advanced warning information to those at risk [4] .",

The problem being addressed concerns improving classification accuracy of SD levels and increasing training potential of a sparse real-world sample. The methodology presented refers to proposed approaches for accurate prediction modelling of disease vector density indicating likelihood of transmission risk in a selected area. This research focuses on the classification problem of predicting the density levels of schistosomiases disease vectors in order to identify areas of high disease risk. The input variables in this work are the environment factors used for predicting snail density such as soil moisture, vegetation and tasselled cap indices. The output variable refers to the snail density level classification i.e. 'Low', 'Medium' and 'High'. Consequently, if the environment conditions of a particular study area are similar to those with proven high snail density then we can infer that the surrounding freshwater area is of potential risk and provide communities with a health warning. Our approach is to assess the risk of disease transmission using environment-based data as training seed when making predictions for early warning detection of schistosomiasis transmission. Vector density and distribution levels indicate an increased or reduced likelihood of potential infection from freshwater sources which are assessed using labelled environment information from relevant areas [9] . There are many lakes of interest when analysing freshwater snail distribution for SED research in China. These include areas in proximity to Dongting Lake and neighbouring Poyang Lake which can be used to assess freshwater snail distribution in different regions of China [10] . Dynamic land conditions present at any one time on earth can tell a lot about what can happen in terms of natural disasters such as earthquakes and they can also indicate conditions which are most conducive for disease vectors to thrive [11] .",

For example, it is the case that freshwater snails prefer warmth and moisture in their habitat for optimum breeding conditions. This indicates that if soil moisture levels and climate conditions are favourable in a relevant area then there is increased chance of high snail distribution and density in that area [12] . The only available treatment for those infected with SED is the drug Praziquantel which can be taken once infected and therefore cannot be used for prevention [13] . In most high-risk areas of epidemic disease infection, similar climate conditions are present as well as socio-economic circumstances. Studies show that due to the preferred temperatures for disease vectors to flourish, the majority of epidemic diseases cases investigated can be found in parts of Asia, Africa and South America which provide ideal surroundings for vectors to multiply [14] .",

In addition, problems exist with partially complete data for use with machine learning methods due to lack of satellite image clarity. These problem areas have yielded perennial issues with satellite image extraction techniques and disease prediction modelling accuracy. There exists somewhat of a dichotomy in the realm of data mining and machine learning domains as to how best to approach the classification process in terms of training data volume and validity. The paradoxical research options of using a sparse set of real-world data being expensive and time-consuming to collect, compared with using satellite image extraction of environment features yielding vast repositories of training data, has proven to be a difficult issue to clarify. It is the assertion of this research that the most appropriate approach is to apply machine learning methods using existing sparse field-survey data for building prediction models. Field-survey data is combined with satellite extracted environment images of the same area for corroborating classification experiments. To improve scope of the machine learning process in future, the aim is to use these studies for SD classification of future RS generated unlabelled data in order to make accurate predictions of disease transmission likelihood in a specified area. Solutions proposed in this paper aim to address and improve on issues highlighted while taking into consideration previous work in disease prediction modelling and data imputation [15, 16] .",

Training data was first processed using synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) by applying equal SD class numbers to each test parameter before synthetic instance increases to assess larger sample performance improvement and avoid potential over-fitting issues [19] . We propose that ensuring an equal number of SD instances before applying SMOTE with exponential increases; may be advantageous to classification results without providing skewed results. Imbalanced data is a problem faced due to the nature of this study area in which there can be a large distribution of disease vectors in a study area at either end of the scale. This may skew results and give a misrepresentation of the study area as a whole therefore, our aim is to build synthetic prediction models which provide a varied data pool for applying machine learning approaches when using a limited training sample. A flowchart depicting these applied methods is shown in Fig. 1 with details discussed further in this research along with benchmark results. The proposed methods in this research are developed to address this niche disease study area with results having implications on the wider epidemic prediction field for schistosomiasis disease. The novelty of methods proposed and used in each of the experiments encompass the synthesizing of incremental machine learning with transductive reasoning for the training sample to learn while actively labelling instances in the set.

Inconsistent prediction accuracy performance for future snail density and distribution levels when provided with environment feature values.

Lack of real-world sample data available due to expense and labour requirements poses a problem for classification and prediction performance. A synthetic data simulation application is presented in which SMOTE is applied after pre-processing raw sample data then equalising the number of classes to avoid potential imbalance and over-fitting issues. This provides empirical evidence as to the benefits of using sparse real-world data for training as opposed to a much larger pool of machine generated data based on the original training set.

Indeed, it is noticeable that SVM performs well in comparison with traditional algorithms when applied for arbovirus epidemic disease prediction modelling with 90% classification accuracy achieved [26] . This study however, was achieved using 5000 instances for training purposes whereas a much more limited data sample is available for performing machine learning experiments in this work.

This approach is worth considering when studying on a multi-variate analysis such as this current study as the use of differing approaches to achieve the same goal through a process of synthesizing identifying aspects in the dataset.

The real-world collected data in this research will is used as training seed for labelling future RS generated data which is then used for making predictions. A transductive labelling approach was initially applied [28] with an incremental element added which meant that any new instances capable of being labelled could then be added to the original data pool with the aim of increasing the chance of providing labels in successive increment phases of the labelling process. Proposed LTA and STA are an extension of the incremental transductive process which apply multi-classifier options for labelling. These ensemble approaches were a natural progression when using a multi-classifier solution for labelling as they provide options to determine the required confidence level as well as distinguishing agreement between classifiers before a class label is provided. The ITEA methods are a development of previous work [18] which detailed initial ideas and rationale to introduce the multi-classifier option into the incremental process in order to provide a choice for labelling when using multiple algorithms. The algorithm described in the Pseudocode essentially shows the procedures for LTA and STA proposed approaches which are similar in their structure. The LTA method declares that for unlabelled instances, if the probability confidence threshold is met by any of the classifiers; then that corresponding SD label is provided to the instance. The STA method is similar however, it requires all of the classifiers otherwise no label is provided to the instance. The selection of the most appropriate ensemble approach depends on the stringent requirements of a particular research study.",

These were selected due to the positive results received when applied to the disease prediction problem domain and also due to the variety in each approach which yields greater balance for experiment conditions. The classification is focused on three SD classes of 'Low', 'Medium' and 'High' making it a multi-variate analysis problem that is used to provide indication of disease likelihood rather than binary dense or not for improving disease likelihood analysis. If these algorithms perform well during testing then they can be considered for modifying to increase classification effectiveness with this research. Classifiers used in each of the experiments in these studies to assess the distribution and density of schistosomiasis vector levels. NB is a probabilistic algorithm which aims to classify data instances without bias based on the vector class properties. The NB classifier was found to provide consistent performance across the SED prediction domain however, it struggles to achieve the highest classification accuracy results when compared with other algorithms. SVM classification splits the data using a hyper plane which then deduces the class and instance it should reside in. SVM has shown to provide increased classification accuracy over NB in disease prediction research however NB is relatively more consistent across varied datasets [26] . Modified versions of SVM have been widely used with success in the area of disease predictions in epidemiology studies [29] thus it was deemed suitable and applied it with the previous method. Based on the Java implementation of the C4.5 algorithm, J48 creates rules for classification based on the information present in the set [30] . During experiments it was shown to perform well when compared with the other selected algorithms in many instances with higher classification accuracy percentages. MLP is a classification tool which functions as a feed-forward neural network and has shown promising results in data classification [31] . One of the advantages of its application is that it continually processes data in order to distinguish classes. In this study, ten layers are used with five neurons hidden and three output neurons. In addition to aforementioned classifiers, a LibLinear algorithm was applied due to positive performance in similar multiclass problem research [32] and a novel feature ranking approach namely max-relevance-max-distance for comparison with our proposed methods [33] .",

This is a common problem when analysing satellite images and is related to the climate conditions at the time of image acquisition [34] . For example, rain or heavy fog will reduce visibility from space rendering poor resolution from which to extract environment information from. This research issue is important to address for these occasions as a partially complete dataset can considerably reduce machine learning effectiveness for classification and making predictions. The necessity for addressing missing data instances is due to the nature of classification for these disease vectors and difficulty in attaining primary field survey data. Larger training sets are desirable for use in prediction modelling due to increased training and classification potential so the aim is to retain as much collected sample data as possible especially in the case of learning with limited resources. Simply removing instances which are incomplete would likely result in higher SD classification accuracy in many cases however it would also distort the sample data and misrepresent the selected study area. This would not be indicative of the state of environment therefore the objective for real-world samples is to interrogate authentic environment data as much as possible to extract the prescient information. Common imputation methods for dealing with this problem tend to use mean attribute values from the original set, however the aim of this work is to provide a more bespoke dataset inclusive solution that outperforms standard methods when replacing actual values:",

These methods have shown to be successful in providing accurate class labels to a variety of different machine learning problems. Limited availability of real-world training samples is a common problem in this research discipline and one that is being continually addressed to find a satisfactory solution [35] . Of course, the learning approach that applied is dependable upon the research problem being addressing. Based on the requirement to make predictions using limited training samples as seed for future classification, this indicates using a combination of labelled and unlabelled data with this research which is deemed most suited to semi-supervised machine learning [36] . It is the assertion of this research that semi-supervised approaches are most suitable to apply to this problem domain due to their ability to provide sufficient solutions when considering classification problems with limited training samples [37] . A key contribution of this work is to make predictions on future epidemic disease likelihood based on the environment factors present in a particular area. Taking into consideration acquired field-survey samples over a number of years for making future unlabelled predictions, semi-supervised learning is the most appropriate paradigm to pursue. In addition to this, current research using semisupervised learning and classification is progressing and providing consistently promising results. Introducing an incremental training element to a semi-supervised labelling process provides a more proactive approach in terms of the machine learning applied for accurate SD classification. This active learning process has the capacity to inform and update the machine process while simultaneously providing class labels [38] . The rationale is to maximize the machine learning capacity before labelling SD instances and has proved to be viable and effective strategy for semi-supervised research application [39] . ITEA performance in this paper is evaluated with comparative analysis using the same selection of algorithms and standard Stacking ensemble classification. ITEA was proposed and implemented to inform the research process for future experiments and demonstrate how selected classifiers behave under different constraints when labelling SD classes. Application of ITEA methods used in addressing vector classification or with alternative related research issues is dependable on user requirements and whether the necessity for providing a class label is prioritised over a more stringent labelling process; for example a scenario where an efficient approximation or probability is required rather than a critical piece of information. Experiments were conducted using well-established algorithms in the bioinformatics research domain including NB, SVM, J48 and multilayer perceptron with application of WEKA machine learning software. Classifiers were combined using the default stacking meta-learner implemented in WEKA and compared with proposed liberal (LTA) and strict (STA) training approaches. As part of the incremental transductive models proposed, a set of constraints must be selected as well the confidence threshold to which any label can be assigned by the classifiers. Then the passive iteration threshold must be set that stops the labelling process when the active learning process can no longer provide new labels for SD classes. The confidence level was set at 85% for each of the tests and the same four algorithms were used for each training set.",

In light of this, it was decided to implement SVM as part of a semi-supervised incremental approach with the aim of developing an active learning process that can provide SD class labels with high degrees of confidence and consistency. Incremental transductive SVM (ITSVM) was previously proposed as a semisupervised method for labelling SD classes and applies the SVM classifier incrementally with newly labelled instances being added to the original sample for increasing training potential. Benchmark results in these initial studies comparing ITSVM with standard SVM application resulted in SD labelling improvement on 21% of test cases [17] . It is apparent from the ITSVM process in Fig. 3 that existing instances are used with the SVM classifier for assigning SD class labels in a semi-supervised process. Newly labelled instances are then added to the training data thus increasing labelling potential in an incremental active learning process.",

The basis for this is that ensemble classifier solutions have shown to provide increased classification performance accuracy than standalone algorithms [24] . This being the case, novel ITEA approaches were developed to provide SD class labels using a combination of multi-classifier learning methods. As part of the ITEA, two implementations are derived which are LTA and STA training approaches. These approaches are designed to provide bespoke labelling processes using multi-classifiers solutions for the providence of SD class labelling when required to a specified confidence level. The rationale for these ITEA methods was to provide a classification process with the caveat of label confidence selection and stringency of corroboration between chosen classifiers. Applying these methods for problems in a case specific and selective manner may provide the most appropriate approach for that particular sparse data paradigm. Vector labelling methods in this research are not limited to schistosomiasis disease alone but can be applied for alternative environment-based disease prediction models that use machine learning solutions. The first ITEA sub-method is a LTA which has a labelling requirement of any single selected classifier from those chosen which is capable of assigning a class label to the selected confidence level. Using the LTA method requires selecting a number of classifiers to build an SD labelling model with the basic constraint of a one classifier assignment strategy. Prior to running the labelling process, a pre-defined confidence level is decided then during the incremental process the liberal aspect of the method requires a single classifier to meet the desired confidence level in order for a class label to be assigned. The STA is similar process to the LTA with the confidence selection and classifiers pre-defined but the point at which it differs concerns label assigning constraints. With the STA, all classifiers selected must meet the required confidence levels and assign a label to the selected class in agreement otherwise the instance remains unlabelled.",

Synthetic data instances used in experiments are created based on original real-world training data provided by our research partners. Raw training sample data was pre-processed before filtering the data then applying SMOTE. The rationale is to first increase the sample size to attain an equal number of classes in each set before incrementally increasing synthetic instance numbers to the stipulated size. The SMOTE technique generates an increased number of synthetic data instances based on the original dataset provided. SMOTE constructs synthetic instances of data which aim to improve classifier performance by providing a balance of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority in a way that seeks to reduce the loss ratio during classification [40] . SMOTE is a method traditionally used for over-sampling and data imbalance issues. The purpose of SMOTE application with this research is to address the issue of sparsity of data for training purposes. The aim is to assess the effectiveness of increasing instances of data on classification performance in contrast to real-world limited samples. As part of this research, SD class numbers were equalised in order to avoid skewing results due to the fact that there is varied distribution in the target study area which potentially provides imbalance and over-fitting. The SMOTE Equilibrium technique was implemented by preprocessing raw field survey data then equalising the number of SD classes from each year. This synthetic instance generation should result in a larger training set with less over-fitting for applying selected classification methods.",

Ultimately, if applying SMOTE can greatly improve classification performance over original data performance, then the process can be optimised to provide a bespoke model for use with this research issue. The rationale behind proposing SMOTE is based on the fact that although there is the now the technological potential to access to vast sources of satellite imagery to extract environment information for classification, this may not be sufficient to achieve the greatest performance. It is important to also consider the fact that sparse training samples may not be representative of the greater population of data. Testing was conducted on each year of training data and the SMOTE method was modified to achieve an equilibrium of SD classes and provide balance in the sample to eliminate the likelihood of over-fitting. This recurring issue with many labelling problems and classification research disciplines may skew results if not addressed [42] . SMOTE has been applied with many studies in bioinformatics to address imbalanced data issues. This suggests that the imbalanced data problem is a recurring issue in various disciplines of machine learning for classification that this research hopes to address by avoiding imbalanced data with skewed results [43] . Using over-sampling as opposed to under-sampling techniques, the aim is to increase training potential of a sparse dataset by generating a larger pool of data based on the original limited set.",

The purpose of this is to analyse whether an increase in simulated instance numbers of synthetic data in addition to the equilibrium caveat, can improve balance and performance over original data classification results. To implement the SMOTE Equilibrium approach, the data was processed to equalise the balance of instances in each set, then SMOTE was applied to increase original instance numbers for each year in multiples of 100 ranging from 100 to 1000 instances. Results of these experiments will highlight the possibility of achieving significant increase in accuracy performance for SD prediction with an increase in data instances or whether the difference between a sparse sample will be rendered negligible. The interest of this research is to discover how classification accuracy performance changes with an increased synthetic data pool as opposed to a limited real-world set. If it is the case that a snapshot of data can provide competitive results when compared with a much larger pool of data, then research can be focused on utilising sparse training data rather than spending time on sourcing field survey experts. This will reduce the requirements and cost of specialist equipment needed for collection of training material, saving acquisition time and resources.

This is a matter to investigate further to assess the cause of reduction in these instance brackets in this particular year. As seen in Fig. 7 , it is evident when increasing from 1000 to 10000 instances there continues to be good performance with gradual increases made. The exception of this is with NB which seems to level out albeit with high classification accuracy during 2003 and 2005. J48 recorded highest classification performance on average across each year with a general accuracy increase per increment of 1000 instances with the exception of the 2007 sample. This year experienced adverse weather conditions and yielded only partially complete environment training data. Further analysis of these results and investigation into the exploitation/ expansion trade-off will reveal how best to generate synthetic instances for addressing this research problem in the future.",

It is indicative of these conditions that resulted in partially complete data in year 2007, and also negative correlation in year 2008.

This provides the ability to show that with every increase of 100 instances on average there is a steady improvement in classification accu- racy percentage with some individual exceptions. Algorithm classification accuracy % and f-measure results are presented in these tables with lowest and highest instance results highlighted to identify range of performance improvement. It is also evident that the SVM classifier performed poorly compared with NB and J48. In accordance with this, the MLP algorithm was applied when testing the SMOTE Equilibrium on the 1000-10,000 instance range in order to diversify the methods further and provide performance analysis. Using synthetic data simulation for each year with instance numbers ranging from 1000-10,000 as shown in Fig. 7 shows a trend in increased performance with all but the NB classifier which remained at consistent accuracy levels throughout each year. Analysis of SMOTE Equilibrium methods show many classification accuracy increases when experimenting from 100 to 1000 instances with an average collective increase of 21.26%. With each increase further from 1000 to 10,000 instances over each year, results indicate a slower collective average accuracy rise of 4.82%.",

ITEA are proposed to improve the snail density labelling potential when dealing with limited training data. This approach was initially applied with the traditional SVM algorithm and then developed further with STA and LTA caveats for suitability and application dependant on the confidence levels required in label providence. SMOTE Equilibrium is introduced as a procedure to provide findings and analysis of classification performance when applying over-sampling techniques to sparse training samples. The data was preprocessed prior to the over-sampling process then comparatively analysed with the original set classification to discover the snail density improvements made with a larger data sample. Collective data training analysis shows that while some years such as 2003 and 2005 performed well when trained with the entire combined data collection, the remaining years did not fare as well. This is due to inconsistency with environment conditions making it difficult for classification during these alternate years. The training process does not handle the environment anomalies well when classifying so in these cases it may be better to deal with the original smaller dataset for training purposes.",

This is a positive finding which suggests the potential benefits of using incremental, semi-supervised learning for classification in this domain.\u2022 In terms of the ITEA and LTA/STA paradigms, results show that when compared with the standard default Stacking ensemble; LTA outperforms Stacking in each of the including provision of all class labels for 2003, 05and 09 when using the same four algorithms for experimenting on 29.1%.Figure 6shows that 70% and 80% confidence have a high labelling percentage whereas it declines steeply when increasing to the 90% level. STA performed inferiorly to the Stacking ensemble in each of the test cases on average of 40.1% of test cases and was incapable of labelling a single instance from the field survey data in 2007 which signifies the extent of classification difficulties in that year. Correlation of labelling percentage decline was evident with both three and fivepoint category STA results as shown inFig. 6blabelling performance was especially poor in years 2007 and 2008. \u2022 Each of the SMOTE equilibrium Tables 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8",
