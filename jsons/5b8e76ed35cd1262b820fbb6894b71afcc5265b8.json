The authors conducted a meta-analysis to identify risk factors that could predict severe disease and mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 . In their meta-analysis, using data from three studies, the authors reported that having a creatinine level of 133 \u00b5mol/L or more was associated with higher odds of having severe disease or mortality. 1 Some literature suggests that the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19 is low. However, when AKI develops, it is usually an indicator of more severe disease and multi-organ dysfunction.",

In conclusion, we report the pooled incidences of AKI and the need for RRT in an overall hospital and ICU setting for patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
