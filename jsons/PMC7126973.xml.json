The disease was first recorded in England in 1971 and spread to other European and Asian countries (Li et al., 2012, Park et al., 2013, Wood, 1977). Since late 2010, PED prevalence with high morbidity (90\u2013100%) and mortality (70\u2013100%) in suckling pigs has become more clinically frequent, and more severe than the historical clinical symptoms in China (Chen et al., 2011, Li et al., 2012, Yang et al., 2013). The outbreaks of PED suddenly occurred in April 2013 and spread through the pork industry across the United States (US) (Anon, 2014, Chen et al., 2014, Cima, 2013, Stevenson et al., 2013, Vlasova et al., 2014).",

The 28 kb genome encodes four major structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) (Kocherhans et al., 2001, Song and Park, 2012). The S protein of PEDV can be divided into domain 1 (S1) and domain 2 (S2) (Lee et al., 2010, Oh et al., 2014). It is a pivotal surface glycoprotein involved in virus attachment, entry and induction of neutralizing antibodies in the natural host (Cruz et al., 2008, Sun et al., 2008). The N protein is the most abundant viral protein in infected cells, is associated with the viral RNA genome, and may be important for induction of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) (Saif, 1993).",

Therefore, maternal vaccines to induce lactogenic immunity and their transmission to suckling neonates via colostrum and milk are pivotal for early passive protection (Chattha et al., 2015, Wesley and Lager, 2003). Inoculations with PEDV virulent isolates, killed or attenuated strains induce specific mucosal and systemic immune responses in sows (Goede et al., 2015, Ouyang et al., 2015). The specific neutralizing antibodies (NA) were presented in colostrum, milk and serum after attenuated PEDV was orally or intramuscularly administered to late-term pregnant sows (Kweon et al., 1999, Ouyang et al., 2015). Lactogenic immunity, based on the presence of specific NA, can decrease the mortality of neonatal piglets or prevent death after challenge with wild-type PEDV (Goede et al., 2015, Kweon et al., 1999, Song et al., 2007).",

However, the characteristics of PEDV-specific neutralizing antibody responses in mammary secretions have not been characterized. We show that the virus neutralizing antibody titer and the levels of total IgG and IgA in colostrum at day 1 significantly exceeded those in milk at day 3, and declined progressively from day 3 to day 19 after farrowing. Further analysis indicated that IgG levels continued to drop sharply from day 3 to day 19 while IgA declined slightly, more closely to the trend of virus neutralizing activities at the same time. This result indicated that IgA might play a more important role in virus neutralization especially after day 3 post-farrowing.",

The N protein may be important for induction of cell-mediated immunity and be able to effectively facilitate the mucosal and systemic immune responses induced by S1 protein (Liu et al., 2012, Saif, 1993). In addition, M protein plays an important role in viral assembly, and it contains a conserved linear B-cell epitope (Arndt et al., 2010, Zhang et al., 2012). Here, further analyses of the correlations of PEDV neutralizing activities and specific antibody isotypes, IgG and IgA to PEDV S1, S2 or N proteins in mammary secretions during lactation indicated that the specific anti-S1, -S2 and -N IgG did not correlate significantly with viral neutralizing activity in milk. However, the neutralizing activities were dominated by IgA to S1 and S2 proteins in colostrum on day 1 post-farrowing. Subsequently, anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgA in milk played a vital role in viral neutralization. The results demonstrated that PEDV neutralizing activities in mammary secretions, within the limitations of the proteins examined, i.e. S1, S2, and N, were correlated with specific antibodies to structural proteins of PEDV, principally anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgA, in milk.",

The use of 50% reduction as the readout in place of a focus-forming or plaque assay with 90% reduction enables optimization of key parameters, including MOI and testing of the percentage law (Andrewes and Elford, 1933, Brioen and Boeye, 1985). The 50% endpoint for neutralization titers was used in place of 90% reduction in focus-forming units to gain information about the antibody reactivity independently of antigen concentration. Virus\u2013antibody interactions can be modeled as antigen\u2013antibody interactions that conform to the law of mass action as a reaction approaches equilibrium (Klasse and Sattentau, 2002, Reverberi and Reverberi, 2007, Tyrrell, 1953). Since neutralized and non-neutralized virus is in equilibrium at 50% inhibition of infectivity, mathematical modeling can be used to assess functional qualities of antibodies and antisera that have viral neutralizing activity, as has been shown in HIV, influenza virus, human adenovirus, equine infectious anemia virus, chimeric SIV/HIV, and Newcastle disease virus infections (Klasse and Moore, 1996, McEwan et al., 2012, Nishimura et al., 2002, Schwartz and Smith, 2014, Shingai et al., 2014, To et al., 2012, Tyrrell, 1953, Willey et al., 2010). Characterization of neutralization affinity, reaction kinetics, and avidity cannot be determined under more stringent conditions, such as at 90% inhibition, which are not at equilibrium. More stringent neutralization readouts may have value for diagnostic purposes or for studies in which there is background cross-reactivity such as with dengue virus (Roehrig et al., 2008). However, cross-reacting substances have not been reported to interfere with PEDV neutralization assays.",

Moreover, the kinetics of neutralizing antibody titers during lactation help explain the pivotal role of IgA in colostrum and milk in suckling neonates to gain passive protection. The amount of neutralizing antibodies necessary for protection in piglets is unknown, and would be affected by titer, volume of milk ingested, antibody stability in the enteric environment, and possibly other variables that could be difficult to measure.
