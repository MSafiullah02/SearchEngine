            "text": "Since February 2013, a novel reassortant influenza A (H7N9) virus has emerged in China (Gao et al., 2013), which has become a global public health concern (Horby, 2013, Uyeki and Cox, 2013, Wu et al., 2013). Human infections with H7 influenza viruses (H7N2, H7N3, and H7N7) have been reported (Hirst et al., 2004, Nguyen-Van-Tam et al., 2006). Unlike H5N1 viruses, infection with H7N2, H7N3, and H7N7 often cause mild to moderate symptoms in humans, and most of those infections are associated with virus outbreaks in poultry (Belser et al., 2009). A total of 133 human infections including 43 fatal cases have been reported as of July 4, 2013 (WHO, 2013a). The novel H7N9 virus has acquired some characteristic mutations that facilitate viral recognition of human-type receptors and efficient replication in mammals (Kageyama et al., 2013). The early and rapid detection of the virus in patients or in environmental samples is crucial for preventing virus transmission, and for initiating treatment as soon as possible. Detection methods for this novel virus are urgently needed in a large number of public health laboratories. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is a powerful tool for the sensitive and specific detection of viruses. An rRT-PCR protocol (WHO TaqMan assay) for the detection of H7N9 viruses was provided by the WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Chinese National Influenza Center on April 8, 2013 (WHO, 2013b). Another rRT-PCR assay was also developed for the specific detection of H7N9 (Corman et al., 2013). Both of these assays are single rRT-PCR methods that detect hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes, respectively. In this study, a duplex TaqMan rRT-PCR assay was developed which can detect the HA and NA genes of the novel H7N9 virus simultaneously.",

Each dilution series was tested in the duplex rRT-PCR assay in triplicate. The analytic sensitivity of the duplex TaqMan rRT-PCR assay for the detection of both H7 and N9 genes was a 10\u22124 dilution (4.8 \u00d7 102 copies/mL), which was comparable to that of the commercial H7N9 rRT-PCR kit for detecting both H7 and N9 genes (4.8 \u00d7 102 copies/mL), and that of the WHO TaqMan assay for detecting the H7 gene (4.8 \u00d7 102 copies/mL). However, it is more sensitive than the WHO TaqMan assay for detecting the N9 gene (4.8 \u00d7 103 copies/mL). To determine the actual detection limit (number of copies per reaction) of the duplex TaqMan rRT-PCR assay, in vitro RNA transcripts of HA and NA genes from the H7N9 virus were prepared with T7 RNA polymerase (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions using influenza A/Nanjing/1/2013 (H7N9) RNA as a template. The synthetic RNA transcripts were then purified, quantified, and mixed in equimolar amounts, and diluted ten-fold from 107 to 100 RNA copies/reaction. RNA templates were then tested in the duplex TaqMan rRT-PCR assay. Each concentration was tested in triplicate. The actual detection limit of the assay was found to be approximately 10 copies of synthetic RNA per reaction for both H7 and N9 genes (Fig. 1\n).",

            "text": "This novel H7N9 lineage has become a major public health concern. Although sustained person-to-person transmission of the virus has not been reported, there is a risk that mutations in the virus could facilitate this. In fact, the Asp701Asn substitution in the PB2 gene associated with mammalian adaptation is present in human H7N9 isolates (Chen et al., 2013). Molecular diagnostic assays that can specifically detect H7N9 viral RNA are powerful tools to monitor H7N9 virus infections, investigate risk factors, and can provide important information such as the duration of viral shedding, the infectious period, genetic variability, potential virulence, and the spectrum of clinical illness (Uyeki and Cox, 2013). Two currently available rRT-PCR assays are not duplexed and must amplify two to three gene segments separately to identify H7N9 viruses (Corman et al., 2013, WHO, 2013b). Moreover, the WHO TaqMan assay was less sensitive for the detection of N9 genes compared with H7 genes, which makes it difficult to interpret the results when detecting low copies of viral RNA. Although no other H7 viruses are known to circulate in human populations, we could not exclude the possibility of new reassortant viruses emerging in the future, as co-infection with two viruses has been observed recently (Zhu et al., 2013). Therefore, samples were only scored as positive for H7N9 virus when both H7 and N9 genes were detected. The high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the duplex rRT-PCR assay described in this study was found to be similar to the single rRT-PCR assay, indicating that the duplex RT-PCR assay can serve as a substitute method for the current single rRT-PCR method. In this study, both H7 and N9 genes were detected simultaneously in one tube which provides a cost- and time-saving method for the detection of novel H7N9 viruses and is suitable for large-scale screening purposes. It should be noted that this assay is optimized for human samples, and therefore care must be taken in the interpretation of the results, since H7 or N9 avian influenza viruses from other lineages can also be detected by this assay, especially when applied to environmental specimens. If only H7 genes were detected while N9 genes was not, the result could be explained by the presence of other H7 AIV lineages in the samples, such as H7N2 and H7N7. Likewise, if only N9 genes was detected while H7 genes were not, the result could be explained by the presence of other N9 viruses in the samples, such as H3N9 and H6N9.",
