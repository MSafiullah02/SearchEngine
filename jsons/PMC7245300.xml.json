[22] In a large Norwegian cohort, overweight and obesity were associated with higher 30 day mortality risk after detection of blood borne bacterial infection. [9] Our results suggested both overweight and obesity were risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection, consistent with emerging data in small clinical studies.

We did not capture COVID-19 infections treated outside hospital settings; rather, our outcome was people with the infection of sufficient severity to warrant in-patient care. The response rate to the original baseline survey in UK Biobank was 5.5%. As such, this is a select group: relative to the general population, the study sample is healthier and better educated. While this means that estimates of the occurrence of disease, including COVID-19, have little utility, because exposures range is wide and the study sample is large, risk factors associations are not affected. [25] PAF reflects the prevalence of the risk factor in the population and the strength of its association with the outcome being considered; the core assumption is that the risk factor has a causal link to the outcome. As our results are based on observational data rather than an intervention, the present PAF-findings may overestimate of the proportion of COVID-19 hospitalisation that could be been prevented by lifestyle change.",
