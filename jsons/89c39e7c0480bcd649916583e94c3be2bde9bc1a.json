Currently, most of the detection systems used to monitor binding of biological molecules on sensor surface need some fluorescent or enzymatic labeling. This labeling step charges additional cost and time to the bioanalysis. The other concerned problem regarding this type of analysis is that, in some cases, the labeling reagent itself interferes with the analyte molecule, which then leads to false measurements. This makes the analysis more complex and less reliable. Considering the cost, time consumption, and reliability of the measuring system, this strategy has some disadvantages in monitoring the binding of biological species at the surfaces. There is a growing interest in designing modern bio-recognition systems because of the rapid developments in this field. To obtain the desired information about the analyte molecule with certain degree of confidence, we have to develop suitable sensitive, selective, fast, inexpensive, and label-free detection systems. This problem needs to be addressed mainly in two parts: The first part is associated with the design of selective antibody surfaces that are capable of interacting only specifically with analyte molecules in complex matrices; and the second part is related with the design of transducer that can generate signals more sensitively for very low concentrations of analytes. Mergence of these two strategies can produce innovative detection systems, which can perform monitoring of different bioanalytes with appropriate selectivity and sensitivity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) along with acoustic or mass-sensitive devices provide a highly favorable route to carry out various types of bioanalysis. Although there are some other surface structuring techniques that have some applications in mass-sensitive biodetections, molecular imprinting has high repute in this regard. The imprinted polymers are of rigid and robustness nature, which is not damaged by exposing them into extreme conditions, and, in contrast, acoustic devices give a direct change in frequency corresponding to the bounded mass on their surface. Such detection systems have gained substantial importance during the last decade because of their widespread applications in different fields such as degradation analysis, compost monitoring, enantio-selective sensors, and environmental monitoring. To understand how to design highly selective surfaces for bioanalytes and for their detection by mass-sensitive devices, one should follow the concept of molecular imprinting along with other surface crafting schemes and fundamental principles of acoustic devices.

One of the major advantages of this scheme is that natural antibodies provide sufficient degree of specificity for desired target molecule in complex mixtures. These materials can be immobilized on an appropriate transducer and be used to design biosensors [2, 3] . A very recent example of this strategy has been explained in a review article in which a thin layer of enzymes is immobilized on an electrochemical probe. This sort of detection systems has shown good results regarding sensitivity and selectivity. The major drawback of this technique is the lack of ruggedness and long-term stability of the designed surface, which limits their applications while crafting materials that can face severe conditions and retain their properties for longer period of time.

During polymerization reaction, the polymer chains are self organized around the template compound, which are fixed at the end of reaction.

The geometrical shape, size, and configuration of cavities can be improved for optimal template interaction by modifying the reaction conditions [30, 31] such as pressure, temperature, amount of cross linker and monomer to template proportion [32] . The amount of cross linker is very important as the higher degree of cross linking ensures the generation of cavities of very fine shape for optimal selectivity. Some post-imprinting modifications can also be employed to further improve the cavities shapes for reinclusion. The basic requirements to conduct imprinting process are the high cross linking of polymer and the noninterfering nature of template with polymer matrix. Molecular imprinting can be classified into two types, according to the interaction of monomers with template molecules (i.e., covalent and noncovalent imprinting).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 589, "end": 593, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 594, "end": 597, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 687, "end": 691, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Principle of Molecular Imprinting"}, {"text": "Noncovalent imprinting was first introduced by Mosbach [33] , where the template molecules develop affinity with function groups of monomer through noncovalent associations such as hydrogen boding, dipole-dipole interactions, Van der Waals forces, etc. prior to polymerization. The removal of template molecules takes place very fast as it does not require any bond rupture. This is a fast and straightforward way to design recognition materials for different detection purposes or developing chemical sensors. The only requirement for this process as earlier mentioned is that the template should not interfere with polymer, so there are no more restrictions for analyte size and shape. The only drawback of this technique is that it cannot be applied to those template molecules that do not have any functional group to interact with polymer system, which limits the construction of binding sites for analyte interactions. This problem is solved by later technique in which the model compound is covalently linked with polymer chain. After polymerization, the template molecules are removed by bond rupturing between template and polymer. The imprinted polymer can rebind the analyte molecules reversibly, and the selectivity is achieved by reactive groups in polymer matrix.

Nanoporous polymers possess more imprinted sites when compared with microporous polymers. The other important aspect regarding the sensitivity is the distribution of imprinted sites in polymer layer prior to use for detection purposes. The size of analyte molecules governs the imprinting strategy whether bulk imprinting [36] or surface imprinting is suitable [37] . In bulk imprinting (as shown in Fig. 3. 2), the template molecule is added along with monomer and cross linker at the start of reaction and after polymerization is removed. This strategy is useful for relatively smaller analyte molecules having molecular mass <500 g mol -1 but while considering the larger analytes such as biomolecules, the bulk imprinting is not always complimentary. Although number of interaction sites in bulk imprinting are high in comparison with surface imprinting, keeping in mind the larger size of biomolecules, incomplete reversibility, relatively longer diffusion pathways, and longer time for measurement make their detection highly unfavorable. Therefore, for larger biomolecules, surface imprinting, as shown in Fig. 3 .3, is proposed where template molecules are directly imprinted on the prepolymerized surface by stamping method [38] with a little force.

Although not all of E. coli are toxic for human beings, still some of them are a potential hazard to public health. Among the dangerous species, E. coli O157:H7 is the most fatal one, which can cause severe diseases such as diarrhea, kidney failure, and even death in certain cases.

During the last decade, different groups tried to develop various biosensors based on natural antibodies for the detection of E. coli using different transducers. Most of them had applied specific antibodies immobilized on gold electrode of piezoelectric device such as quartz crystal microbalance. The strategy is very attractive in terms of getting selectivity as natural antibodies specifically bound to particular bacteria with sufficient sensitivity. Zhihong [68] has developed interestingly an unusual strategy for mass-sensitive bacterial detection. He has exploited the carbohydrates and protein recognition interactions for a very sensitive and specific E. coli detection. This method is not purely synthetic but in fact a hybrid approach by designing suitable mannose surfaces for a rigid and strong binding of E. coli. It has been noticed that the detection of E. coli on lectin modified mannose surface has much higher sensitivity about 10 4 times better than mannose alone detection. This in terms of sensitivity is quite good as it improves the detection limit. As the binding of bacteria is strong that does not increase damping drastically, which is good for smooth QCM measurements without too much loss. The sensor specificity was also characterized by exposing different electrodes coated with different chemical layers to known concentration (i.e., 7.5 \u00c2 10 7 cells/mL of E. coli W1485). The frequency shift for different layers, that is, lectin-modified mannose layer (A) and recombinant antibody (210E scFv-cys-) treated electrode QCM surface (B) was determined. The control antigen test was also conducted by adding Staphylococcus aureus (C), and the results have been shown in Fig. 3 .8.

Moreover, some natural antibodies once bound to microorganisms then afterward they are reluctant to release them, which reduce the reversibility of mass-sensitive measurements. The solution of these problems can be made by following a different approach in which artificial recognition materials are used. Surface imprinted layers can be used as artificial antibodies [70] for bacterial detection more effectively when compared with natural antibodies. Polyurethane layers that are robust and rigid in nature have been utilized for surface imprinting of E. coli.
