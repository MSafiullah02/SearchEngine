As the first member of the group coronaviruses found to invade the central nervous system, HEV was initially isolated from encephalomyelitic piglet brains in 1960 by Greig et al. (1962) in Canada. Subsequent studies demonstrated that HEV first infected the epithelial cells lining the upper respiratory tract, and thereafter was delivered retrogradely via peripheral nerves to the central neurons in charge of peristaltic function of the digestive tracts, resulting in the so-called vomiting diseases (Andries and Pensaert, 1980, Yagami et al., 1986). In experimental animals, injection of HEV into rat hind footpad was reported to result in productive infection of the ipsilateral dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) and spinal cord at 3 day postinfection (p.i.), and productive infection of the contralateral primary motor cortex at day 4 p.i. (Hirano et al., 1993, Hirano et al., 1998, Hirano et al., 2004, Bai et al., 2008).",

The unique structure of the SC envelope do not merely give mechanical or nutrient support to the neurons, but also enables SCs to exert a tight control of the extracellular microenviroment around the neurons (Hanani, 2005). So far, it is unclear how HEV is replicated in and transferred from the sensory neurons, and it remains to know what roles SCs play in the HEV-infected ganglia. Given that coronaviruses are able to make use of the cellular events preexisting in the host cells (for review, see Hobman, 1993, Masters, 2006), the clarification of the mechanism underlying coronavirus infection in the sensory ganglia was expected to help understand the cellular events in the ganglionic neurons as well as the relationship between the neurons and their SCs.",

As a rule it was not possible to judge the direction of movement for vesicles opening onto the cell surface. Although in some cases the extracellular virus particles were surely those librated from the infected neurons because no HEV particles were found in the adjacent SCs (for example, Fig. 5B), the possibility could not be excluded that the already released virions may re-enter into the host neurons in a secondary cycle of infection.

Virus particles were contained within smooth-surfaced vesicles in the cytoplasm of the neuronal projections (Fig. 5C\u2013E).

The roles of these perikaryal specializations during HEV infection seem to require further investigations. At the release sites, HEV particles were accumulated in the dilated extracellular space between the neurons and their SCs, and subsequently taken up within vesicular structures by the SCs. Viral replication signs were absent in the cytoplasm of the SCs. On the other hand, the presence of virus particles within lysosome-like structures in the SCs as well as the disappearance of virus particles in the later stage (data not shown) indicated that HEV seemed to be finally cleared by these cells. These observations suggested that SCs may play a restrictive role during HEV propagation.",

On the other hand, increasing evidence showed that SCs can function as phagocytes to clear the cell debris of degenerative neurons during neural traumas (Tay et al., 1984a, Tay et al., 1984b, Zhang et al., 1994) and viral infections (Alema\u00f1 et al., 2001). Moreover, the SCs resident in human trigeminal ganglia have recently been shown to closely resemble microglia because they have also phenotypic and functional antigen-presenting cell properties (van Velzen et al., 2009). Our results showed that SCs engulfed only the released virions but not the cell bodies of HEV-infected neurons at the early stage of HEV infection. This form of phagocytosis does not resemble traditional SC phagocytosis of degenerating or apoptotic neurons. Given that coronaviruses are able to make use of the cellular events preexisting in the host cells (for review, see Hobman, 1993, Masters, 2006), it is of interest to know whether a similar scavenging mechanism can be used by SCs under normal conditions to control the microenvironments surrounding the subjacent neurons.",
