These include diseases of the hematologic, immunologic, and lymphatic systems. In general, species will be discussed together, but when pertinent data are available, each species will be considered separately. The terms \"cervid\" and \"deer\" have been used interchangeably in parts of this chapter by the authors.",

            "text": "An adequate volume of blood for hematologic and biochemical analysis is best obtained from the jugular vein. A docile animal may be restrained in a standing position or tipped up (sheep only) with the head turned away from the jugular vein to be used. Wilder ones, such as some cervids, may require restraint devices or chemical sedation. Ideally, the animal should be restrained by someone other than the blood collector, although the same person may be able to both restrain a sheep and collect blood if the animal is tipped up or a halter is used (see Chapter 1) . The animal should be at rest, with minimal excitement. The collector parts or clips the wool or hair to visualize the jugular vein and then uses the hand not holding the needle to apply digital pressure proximally just above the thoracic inlet to block blood movement through the vein. The vessel may take a second or more to distend after pressure is applied. The collector may then use the needlebearing hand to \"strum\" the vessel and cause the blood to oscillate. If in doubt about whether the distended vessel is the jugular vein, the collector can release the hand placing pressure on the vessel and observe whether the distended vessel disappears; if it does, the distended vessel was probably the jugular vein. The collector should avoid vessels that pulsate because these are likely to be the carotid arteries. The area should be cleaned with alcohol or other disinfectant, water, or a clean, dry gauze sponge. An 18-or 20-gauge, 1-to 1.5-inch needle is usually adequate to collect blood from an adult, whereas a 22-gauge needle may be used in a neonate. The skin of adults or males may be thicker and more difficult to penetrate with the needle. A syringe or evacuated tube attached to a Vacutainer (Becton Dickinson Inc., Rutherford, NJ) can be used to collect blood. The needle should be plunged through the skin into the vein at an approximate 30-degree angle. The blood should not come out of the vessel in pulsatile waves; this is suggestive of an arterial stick. After aseptically obtaining an adequate volume of blood, the collector removes the needle and releases the pressure on the vessel near the thoracic inlet. Pressure should be applied to the site of puncture for a minute or more to prevent extravascular leakage of blood and hematoma formation. The blood should be carefully transferred to a vial containing the appropriate anticoagulant to prevent red blood cell (RBC) rupture. Goat erythrocytes are small and particularly prone to hemolysis. To minimize this problem, goat blood should be collected with a needle and syringe, not a Vacutainer. White blood cell (WBC) differential distribution, individual blood cell staining characteristics, and morphology may be assessed by microscopic examination of a stained blood film. The differential distribution provides more information than total WBC count because inflammatory conditions in artiodactyls often result in a shift in neutrophil populations toward more degenerate, toxic, or immature forms without changing the overall WBC count. 1 The preferred anticoagulant for a complete blood count (CBC) is ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), and tubes should be filled to ensure the proper blood-to-anticoagulant ratio. Blood samples should be processed as soon as possible after collection. If a delay is anticipated, the blood sample should be refrigerated (4\u00b0 C) and an air-dried blood smear should be made because prolonged contact of blood with EDTA causes changes in WBC morphology and the separation of some RBC parasites. Blood can be refrigerated for 24 hours and still yield an accurate CBC.",

The sites of biopsy include the sternebrae, femur, and ileum. The procedure should be done under chemical sedation or anesthesia (see Chapter 18) . The area over the biopsy site is clipped and surgically prepared; the sampler should wear sterile gloves to maintain asepsis. Aspirates can be obtained by inserting a sterile needle attached to a 3-or 6-cc syringe containing one or two drops of EDTA through the bone and into the bone marrow. Drawing back on the syringe plunger several times may aid in the procurement of an acceptable sample; such a sample may consist of as little as 0.5 mL of bone marrow. If the sample is going to be processed immediately, no anticoagulant is required. Core biopsies are obtained using a Jamshidi or Westerman-Jensen biopsy needle. The skin is incised with a scalpel and the biopsy needle is inserted into the bone and turned several times to obtain a core sample. More than one site may be used. The sampler then closes the skin with sutures or staples. Biopsy samples are preserved by placing them in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution. Impression smears can be made from these samples by gently rolling them on a clean glass slide before placing them in the formalin solution. Information obtained from bone marrow samples includes subjective data regarding cell density, megakaryocyte numbers, abnormal cells, maturation patterns of RBCs and WBCs, and the ratio of erythroid to myeloid cells. Prussian blue stain can be used on bone marrow to demonstrate iron stores. Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies are painful and invasive procedures. Therefore, animals should be placed on antibiotics and antiinflammatory drugs prophylactically.",

Ideally, the clinician should obtain the sample before instituting antimicrobial therapy. However, if this is impossible, antimicrobial therapy should be discontinued 48 to 72 hours before sampling. Samples should be taken before and during febrile episodes. The jugular vein is most commonly used to attain a blood culture. As described previously, the skin over the jugular vein should be clipped and surgically prepared. The person collecting the blood sample should wear sterile gloves and use a sterile needle and syringe. Blood samples should be placed immediately in a blood culture flask. The chances of attaining a positive culture from bacteremic animals increase with the size of the sample up to about 30 mL, but adding more than the recommended amount to any single culture vial may overwhelm the capacity of the specialized antibiotic-absorbing resins within the flasks. The clinician should change the needle on the sample syringe after collecting the blood and before putting the sample in the culture medium.

Blood loss is usually covert and commonly caused by gastrointestinal or external parasites. Overt blood loss is usually caused by major trauma such as that caused by dog bites, severe lacerations, male rivalry fighting, or complications of castration or dehorning. CBC values appear normal immediately after acute blood loss. However, after a few hours of fluid redistribution, anemia and hypoproteinemia are evident. Evidence of red cell regeneration (macrocytosis, reticulocytosis, and nucleated red cells) should appear within a day or two of the blood loss. Hemolysis occurs most commonly after ingestion of toxic plants, RBC parasitism, intravenous (IV) injection of hypotonic or hypertonic agents, contact with bacterial toxins, water intoxication, or immune-mediated destruction of opsonized erythrocytes. Ingested toxins include sulfur compounds from onions and Brassica plants (kale and canola), [9] [10] [11] [12] nitrates, nitrites, and copper. [13] [14] [15] [16] Except for that caused by copper, hemolysis usually occurs within a day or two after ingestion. Copper toxicosis can occur after acute overingestion but more commonly is seen in animals that are chronically overfed copper and suffer some stressful event. Goats are more tolerant of excess copper than sheep are, and certain breeds of sheep, particularly the Suffolk, are highly sensitive to copper toxicosis (see Chapters 2 and 5) .",

This can occur locally as a sequela to rapid IV injection of hypotonic substances or after ingestion of a large quantity of water following a period of water deprivation and dehydration (water intoxication). Selenium and copper deficiency have also been associated with Heinz body anemia. 25 Parasite infestation, opsonization, and ingestion of toxic plants typically cause extravascular hemolysis. In these cases, damaged erythrocytes are removed by cells of the reticuloendothelial system, resulting in anemia, pallor, weakness, depression, icterus, and dark urine. Bacterial toxins, changes in plasma osmolality, and copper toxicosis cause intravascular hemolysis, resulting in the additional signs of hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria. Other signs such as fever, neurologic symptoms, and sudden death may be seen with specific diseases. Signs of regeneration should be seen on the hemogram 1 to 2 days after the onset of hemolysis.",

Blood should be withdrawn aseptically from the donor and collected by a bleeding trocar into an open flask or by a catheter into a special collection bag. Blood should be mixed at a 7.5:1 ratio with acid-citrate dextrose, or 9:1 with 2% sodium citrate, or another suitable anticoagulant and administered through a filtered blood administration set. If the jugular vein is not accessible, blood may be infused into the peritoneal cavity, but the slower absorption from that site makes it less effective for treating acute blood loss. The first 15 to 30 minutes of administration should be slow. If no reaction is seen (fever, tenesmus, tachypnea, tachycardia, and shaking), the rate may be increased.

Lymphopenia is an important part of the stress response; nevertheless, the clinician must keep in mind that many diseases stimulate a stress response. Therefore, lymphopenia and neutrophilia may represent either stress or inflammation, and an examination of neutrophil morphology and plasma fibrinogen concentrations may be useful in distinguishing the two situations. A high fibrinogen concentration, toxic changes, and high counts of immature neutrophils indicate inflammation under those circumstances.

The cause of transformation is usually unknown; in rare cases, especially in flock outbreaks in sheep, it can be linked to exposure to the bovine leukemia virus, which has occurred experimentally and as a result of the administration of whole blood Anaplasma vaccines. Whether the bovine leukemia virus can induce lymphosarcoma in goats and cervids is still unclear. Multicentric lymphosarcoma has been reported sporadically in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiatus) and other deer, but bovine leukemia virus infection has not been diagnosed in cervids. 26 In one study of neoplastic diseases affecting goats from 1987 to 2011, lymphoma was identified as the most common neoplasm, accounting for 17.7% of the assessed tumors. 27 In contrast to other species such as cattle, sheep, and horses, lymphomas in goats are predominantly T-cell lymphomas affecting the mediastinum. A recent study attempted to classify the type of lymphoma affecting 15 goats. Using immunohistochemistry (IHC), it was determined that 73% (n 5 11) of affected goats had T-cell lymphoma and only 27% (n 5 4) had B-cell lymphoma. 28 Proliferation of T or B lymphocytes leads to mass lesions and infiltration of viscera. These changes cause physical obstruction (to breathing, blood flow, urination, defecation, etc.), ulceration of mucosal surfaces (blood loss, bacterial invasion), immune system dysfunction, organ failure, and generalized malaise and cachexia.

However, the amount of maternal colostrum produced by the dam, and its composition, as well as the ability of the newborn to stand and nurse in a timely manner, can be affected by several factors. Colostrum IgG concentration and volume of production can be influenced by breed, age, nutrition, body condition score (BCS) at parturition, and vaccination status of the dam. The IgG concentration in colostrum samples from ewes of different breeds can vary between 60 and 125 mg/mL. 32 One study demonstrated that primiparous ewes with low BCS (, 2.75) at lambing produced less colostrum compared with multiparous ewes with similar BCS. Additionally, ewes with higher BCS (. 2.75) tended to produce higher volumes of colostrum compared with ewes with lower BCS. 32 Another study suggested that undernutrition of ewes during late gestation can affect colostrum quality and immune development and function in newborn lambs. 33 It has been suggested that at least 30 g of total IgG should be fed to newborn lambs and kids during the first 24 hours of life to reach adequate transfer of passive immunity. Adequate transfer of passive immunity in small ruminant neonates has been suggested as serum IgG levels at 24 hours of life of \ue024 15 mg/mL. One study indicated that lambs that nurse low-quality colostrum (IgG , 30 mg/mL) had lower serum IgG concentrations compared with lambs that that nurse colostrum of higher quality (IgG . 110 mg/mL), indicating that the concentration of IgG in colostrum is a determining factor for the presentation of failure in the transfer of passive immunity. 34 Other factors such as pregnancy toxemia, gastrointestinal parasitism, excess of iodine intake during pregnancy, and inadequate vaccination of the dam can result in poor colostrum synthesis and quality. 35 Timely consumption of maternal colostrum during the first hours of life is essential to achieve adequate transfer of passive immunity. In small ruminants, cells of the small intestine are able to internalize and transfer IgG into the blood during the first 24 hours of life; however, the absorption efficiency of IgG is higher during the first 6 to 12 hours of life. 32, 36 Factors associated with the neonate, such as weakness, inability to stand, and congenital abnormalities, will prevent timely nursing of maternal colostrum and lead to failure of passive transfer (FPT). Litter size and body weight (BW) of the kid(s) have also been correlated with inadequate absorption of IgG from colostrum. One study demonstrated that litter sizes of three light goat kids (, 2.8 kg BW) or more had significantly lower mean serum IgG levels at 24 hours of life when compared with litter sizes of one or two heavier kids (9.85 versus 18.30 mg/mL, respectively). 37 This suggests that special attention and monitoring should be paid to multiple fetus gestation as the risk of FPT under these circumstances at kidding is higher; however, the quality of colostrum, amount ingested, and adequacy of absorption are rarely monitored by small ruminant producers in natural or artificial rearing systems. The use of monitoring tools to evaluate colostrum quality and IgG absorption is common in modern dairy cattle operations, and these tools are readily available for small ruminant production systems. Recent reports have presented the use of %Brix in maternal colostrum and neonate serum and its positive correlation with serum total proteins (STPs) at 24 hours as effective monitoring tools of FPT in lambs and goat kids. [38] [39] [40] The use of STP has also been used to monitor colostrum deficiency intake in mule deer fawns 41 ; however, adequate values of serum IgG for cervid neonates have not been established yet.",

            "text": "Diagnosis. History of dam dystocia, inadequate colostrum nursing, complete colostrum deprivation, and signs of undernourishment or sepsis in the first few days after birth are usually a presumptive indication of failure in the transfer of passive immunity. A high prevalence of diarrhea and respiratory disease in neonates should prompt investigation and evaluation of passive transfer of immunity in affected herds or flocks. Owners occasionally evaluate lambs or kids for adequate intake by picking up the animal and holding it at ear level, while carefully cradling the head and neck, and then shaking the abdomen to hear milk in the abomasum; however, this is not a reliable indication of adequate transfer of passive immunity. A definitive diagnosis of FPT can be made by direct laboratory measurement (single radial immunodiffusion [SRID]) of IgG in serum at 24 hours of life. Although some practitioners use the value of IgG used in dairy calves (10 mg/mL), others have suggested an IgG value , 15 mg/mL to establish the presence of FPT in small ruminants. 45 Numerous semiquantitative methods of estimating IgG are available and are easy to use in sheep, goats, and cervids. The most common is the measurement of serum total solids or STP values at 24 hours of life through an optical refractometer. The STP at 24 hours of life in a well-hydrated animal has demonstrated correlation with serum IgG in calves, lambs, and goat kids. Studies in goat kids indicated that an STP between 5.3 and 5.4 g/dL was associated with adequate transfer of passive immunity. 39, 40 Another study demonstrated FPT in lambs with STP values , 4.5 g/dL at 24 hours of life. 32 A study in mule deer suggested that fawns with an STP # 5 g/dL had inadequate colostrum intake and FPT. Recently, the measurement of %Brix in maternal colostrum and serum with a digital Brix refractometer has become an alternative method to evaluate colostrum quality and FPT in dairy operations. Colostrum %Brix . 22% and serum %Brix . 8.4% have been associated with adequate transfer of IgG in calves and goat kids. 39 Other qualitative methods to assess the transfer of passive immunity in large animals include various agglutination (glutaraldehyde), precipitate assays (sodium sulfate), and measurement of g-glutamyl transferase (GGT) in serum. These methods may be relied on to give an overall flock assessment of adequacy of passive transfer, but they are rarely accurate enough to provide definitive information on individual animals. Treatment. FPT is not in itself pathologic, but it greatly increases the neonate's susceptibility to infectious diseases. The amount of colostrum absorbed across the gut decreases with time, especially in animals that have been ingesting other proteins (e.g., the casein in milk); it also decreases with illnesses that decrease gastrointestinal function. Neonatal small ruminants should receive at least 4 g of IgG/kg of BW or ideally 30 g of total mass of IgG from a good-quality colostrum source (. 50 mg/mL of IgG) during the first hours of life. 32 Other authors recommend an intake of 180 to 210 mL of colostrum/kg during the first 18 hours of life. 46 In artificial rearing systems or lamb feedlots, feeding of colostrum every 6 hours until 24 hours of life is recommended. 47 When same species' maternal colostrum is unavailable, goat colostrum or bovine colostrum/colostrum replacers or are a good alternative; however, hemolysis has been reported in lambs receiving cattle colostrum. 48 One study demonstrated that there was no difference in serum IgG levels of lambs that received the same volume of sheep or goat colostrum at birth. 47 Another study demonstrated that lambs that received 250 mL of a bovine colostrum replacer at birth in addition to 250 mL of stored sheep colostrum at 6 hours of life had higher serum %Brix values at 24 hours and had less incidence of disease during the preweaning period compared with lambs that received the same volume of stored sheep colostrum at birth and at 6 hours of life. 38 Since IgG absorption cannot be extended more than 24 hours after birth, administration of an oral colostrum source is the best treatment in the immediate postpartum period in still-healthy neonates. After the window for immunoglobulin absorption has closed, plasma, serum, or whole blood administered by the IV or intra-peritoneal route is the best way to raise the neonate's blood immunoglobulin concentrations. Adult donor plasma contains approximately 2.5 to 3.5 g of immunoglobulin/dL, so administration of a volume equivalent to 10% of BW or a dose of 20 to 40 mL/kg has been recommended for the treatment of large animal neonates. If plasma is used instead of colostrum, administration of vitamins A, D, and E also may be beneficial.",

Prevention of FPT should be based on the establishment of an adequate colostrum program managing the previously mentioned factors that affect production, quality, and absorption of maternal colostrum components in lambs, goat kids, and fawns. Ensuring colostral quality is best done through good nutrition, health care, and vaccination of dam (see Chapters 2 and 19) . Administration of vaccines 6 weeks before parturition, followed in 2 weeks with a booster, provides the highest quantity of protective immunoglobulin in the colostrum. Antepartum leakage is rarely the problem in small ruminants that it is in horses and cattle. However, in a flock or herd environment, still-pregnant dams may steal babies from other sheep or goats. To prevent such theft and the resultant loss of colostrum by the \"adopted\" neonate, owners may choose to keep pregnant animals separate from those that have already delivered. If complete separation is not possible, the dam and her offspring should be allowed to bond with each other in a private pen (\"jug\" or \"crate\") for at least 24 hours before being placed back with the flock. Clipping excessive wool or mohair from around the perineal area and udder before lambing or kidding, expressing the teats to ensure they are not plugged, and having extra colostrum available when pregnant females are placed in jugs or crates are other good preventive measures.",

            "text": "Etiology and Pathogenesis. Uncomplicated diarrhea in lambs, goat kids, and fawns may be caused by infectious agents such as viruses, bacteria, and protozoa. In goat kids and elk calves, metabolic causes of diarrhea have been described. 49, 50 Group B and A rotavirus, enterotoxigenic E. coli K99, Cryptosporidium parvum, and other Cryptosporidium spp. have been commonly identified as causal agents of diarrhea in small ruminant neonates. [51] [52] [53] [54] With recent advances in diagnostics and metagenomics of the enteric environment of large animals, novel viruses have been identified as potential causal agents of diarrhea in lambs and goat kids. Adenovirus, Astrovirus, Calicivirus, Coronavirus, and Picornavirus have been identified in feces of diarrheic lambs and goat kids 55 ; however, their role in the pathogenesis of neonatal diarrhea is still uncertain. These organisms differ from the agents of complicated diarrhea in that they do not invade beyond the gut wall or result in systemic toxemia (see Chapter 5) . Additional causes of diarrhea reported in goat kids and elk include lactose intolerance and hypernatremia, respectively. 49, 50 Less frequently, bacteria such as C. perfringens, Clostridium difficile, and attaching and effacing E. coli have been associated with complicated diarrhea in small ruminant neonates. 54, 56 The net result of such an infection is that a large volume of water and electrolytes are lost into the bowel due to malabsorptive, hypersecretory, or hyperosmolar processes. If enough fluid and electrolytes are lost, dehydration and metabolic acidosis arise, inducing systemic clinical signs of depression and weakness in association with diarrhea. In goats, this clinical entity is one component of the floppy kid syndrome.",

One study reported that pregnant does shed 7 to 10 times more oocysts during the 3 weeks around kidding compared with other time periods. 58 Additionally, poor husbandry/hygiene of lambing/kidding sheds, fecal soiling, flock size (. 200 animals), lambing/kidding season (winter/spring), and the presence of C. perfringens type A in feces have been suggested as potential risk factors for uncomplicated diarrhea in small ruminant neonates. [58] [59] [60] Clinical Pathology. The leukogram should be normal or show abnormalities compatible with stress. Serum biochemical or blood gas analysis may reveal evidence of intestinal malabsorption, electrolyte loss, metabolic acidosis (hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hyperkalemia, low bicarbonate, and increased anion gap), and dehydration (hyperalbuminemia and increased blood urea nitrogen [BUN] and creatinine). In contrast with the common leukogram and biochemical abnormalities found in calves, lambs, and goat kids with uncomplicated diarrhea, elk calves with diarrhea develop leukocytosis, hyperchloremia, and hypernatremia (serum Na . 153 mEq/L). 50 Additionally, increased anion gap, BUN, creatinine, and albumin concentrations have been reported in affected elk calves. 50",

Rehydration: Calculate the percent dehydration and use to calculate fluid requirements for a 24-hour period.

Special care should be taken in these cases when selecting fluids to treat affected animals as the risk of causing hypernatremia is higher. 61 In cases of diarrhea in elk calves, hypernatremia is common, and fluids should be selected accordingly. 50 In the majority of cases, initial replacement of sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate with fluids containing proper composition is recommended. 61 Example: Assessment suggests a bicarbonate deficit of 16 mEq bicarbonate in a 3-kg, comatose lamb with prolonged skin tenting (0.6 is the multiplier for ECF in a neonate): 0.6 3 (16 mEq) 3 3 kg 5 29 mEq bicarbonate. Commercial IV 8.4% sodium bicarbonate solutions contain 1 mEq of bicarbonate per milliliter and could be added directly to IV fluids in severely dehydrated and acidotic animals. 61 Therefore, the immediate goal is to provide 300 mL of fluid and 29 mEq of bicarbonate to this lamb in a formulation that resembles normal ECF. Fluids can be given by various routes. Selection of route of administration of fluids depends on degree of dehydration, presence or not of a strong suckle reflex, and degree of depression. Neonates with advanced degrees of dehydration, depression, and absence of suckle reflex will benefit from IV fluid therapy. In contrast, neonates with mild dehydration and active suckle reflex can be effectively treated with oral electrolytes 61 ; however, if oral fluids have not produced an improvement within 2 to 4 hours, IV treatment should be strongly considered. Other routes such as subcutaneous, intra-peritoneal, and intra-osseous can also be used for fluid administration to neonates.",

Elk deer calves commonly develop diarrhea with hypernatremia (serum Na . 153 mEq/L) compared with other large animal neonates, where hyponatremia is more common. 50 Therefore, administration of oral electrolyte solutions designed for other ruminants (calves, lambs, and kids) should be avoided in these animals. A dilution (1:2 or 1:4) of commercially available bovine calf electrolyte solutions to reduce sodium content is recommended for the treatment of elk calf diarrhea. 50 The use of lactated Ringer's solution, which has a low sodium concentration in addition to a very low reduction rate of serum sodium (, 1.7 mEq/L/hour) has been advocated in the fluid therapy of hypernatremic elk calves with diarrhea. 50 Additional Therapy. Dextrose (2.5-5%) solutions can be added to the fluid therapy of hypoglycemic animals. The use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in neonatal ruminants with diarrhea is controversial due to the risk of renal damage and abomasal ulceration; however, in cases of diarrhea complicated by septicemia or endotoxemia, NSAIDs should be used to reduce the effects of systemic inflammation. Flunixin meglumine at a dose of 1.1 to 2.2 mg/kg is the only NSAID approved for food animal use. Similarly, the use of oral or systemic antibiotics in cases of uncomplicated diarrhea is controversial due to its potential effect on the intestinal microbiota and development of bacterial resistance; however, their use is warranted in the presence of septicemia or endotoxemia in addition to diarrhea. In these cases, b-lactams such as oral amoxicillin or systemic ceftiofur are usually good choices. The effect of mucosal protectants and probiotics in cases of diarrhea is unknown in small ruminant neonates, and their use is left to practitioners based on their own experiences (see Appendix 1) .",

Such animals benefit from the provision of supplemental oxygen, either through a nasal insufflation tube or by oxygen tent.

Therefore, these problems are best treated in animals showing signs of dehydration with the administration of a balanced, physiologic electrolyte solution. Metabolic acidosis usually is accompanied by either obvious evidence of bicarbonate loss (diarrhea) or severe dehydration. However, neither of these conditions is present with floppy kid syndrome. This descriptive title is applied to muscle weakness, anorexia, and depression in kids observed in the first 2 weeks of life. By its strictest definition, floppy kid syndrome refers to metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap without dehydration or any known cause in young kids that were normal at birth. A variety of disorders and conditions have been proposed as the cause of metabolic acidosis without dehydration, including intestinal fermentation of milk in well-fed kids with subsequent absorption of volatile fatty acids, transient neonatal renal tubular acidosis, and lactic acidosis secondary to toxic impairment of cardiovascular function. Overgrowth of C. perfringens type A often is suggested as a source of the toxin. With a high anion gap, a pathologic condition that leads to overproduction of an organic acid is more likely than one that leads to bicarbonate loss. The disease can occur in individual animals or in outbreaks; although parity of the dam and number of offspring have not been associated with this metabolic disturbance, aggressively feeding kids are more likely to suffer from milk fermentation or clostridial overgrowth. An infectious etiology appears to be more likely in herds displaying an increased incidence of this metabolic disturbances as the kidding season progresses. The disease also is reported to be more common in meat goats than in dairy goats. The prevalence can vary tremendously from year to year in a single flock or region. A similar disease has been reported in calves and llama crias, and lambs are likely to be susceptible under the right conditions.",

Most possible causes are found in the previous list of conditions that cause weakness and depression in neonates. Among these entities, sepsis and hypoxemia are the most important items and therefore must also be considered possible causes of floppy kid syndrome. Treatment and prevention of floppy kid syndrome currently follow the same lines as for treatment and prevention of neonatal sepsis or enteritis. Spontaneous recovery of animals with floppy kid syndrome may occur. However, in valuable kids, quick assessment of blood chemistry and base deficits will allow requisite correction of electrolyte and blood pH abnormalities with 1.3% sodium bicarbonate. 63",

The major effect of the phospholipase/ sphingomyelinase CPA, produced by all C. perfringens biotypes, is cell lysis and hemolysis, and its role on intestinal disease of large animals is not well understood. However, this toxin has been associated with hemolytic disease and hemorrhagic enteritis in large animals; CPB, produced by C. perfringens types B and C, is a trypsinlabile toxin associated with necrotizing enteritis and enterotoxemia in large animal neonates; ETX, produced by C. perfringens types D and B, is a trypsin-activated necrotizing toxin associated to vasculitis, edema, and necrosis of the CNS and enterotoxemia; and ITX, another trypsin-activated necrotizing toxin produced by C. perfringens type E, has also been associated to intestinal disease in small ruminants. 64,65 C. perfringens types C and D are considered the most important types in veterinary medicine as they can cause disease in most farm animals. 66 Severe clinical disease due to bacteria sporulation and massive toxin production only occurs when the normal intestinal environment and microbial balance are disrupted in affected individuals. Decreased peristalsis and poor ruminal and abomasal function have also been proposed as factors that contribute to disease presentation. Weather and handling stresses, feed changes, and an overabundance of high-energy feeds such as milk, bakery products, and cereal grains might promote bacteria overgrowth and exotoxin synthesis and release. Additionally, other enteric infections that disrupt the mucosal border may increase systemic absorption of toxins and promote severe disease.",

This could be an alternative for the prevention of morbidity and mortality caused by C. perfringens type A. Prevention efforts should focus on environmental hygiene and avoiding gut conditions favorable for proliferation of the organism (high content of soluble carbohydrates in the diet).

The reported geographic range of both diseases is limited (type B to the United Kingdom and South Africa and type C to the United Kingdom, Australia, and North America), even though infection with C. perfringens type C appears to occur worldwide. These organisms cause very similar diseases called lamb dysentery and hemorrhagic enterotoxemia, respectively. Very young lambs and kids (1-4 days to 2-3 weeks of age) are usually affected due to the presence of trypsin inhibitors in colostrum. 75 Older animals may become susceptible as a result of overwhelming infection or trypsin inhibition by some soy and sweet potato products or temporary suppression of pancreatic trypsin production (Struck in adult sheep). With both diseases, the beta toxin (CPB) is a required pathophysiologic factor, and inactivation of this toxin after maturation of pancreatic trypsinogen secretion is what commonly limits the susceptible population to neonatal animals. The cytolytic and necrotizing effects of the beta toxin (CPB), in synergy with the beta2 toxin (CPB2), cause necrosis and ulceration of the intestinal mucosa and are translocated into circulation, causing severe toxemia and death. 75 The diseases initially affect lambs and kids younger than 3 days of age, with illness occasionally occurring in older lambs. The incidence of disease in lambs and kids can be around 15 to 30%, with a case fatality rate of 100%. High stocking density in lambing areas, cold weather, single-born lambs, and high milk production of dams have been suggested as potential risk factors for type B and C enterotoxemia. 76 Because of management practices in young animals and age-related vulnerability, fecal contamination of teats, hands, and equipment that enter the mouths of the neonates (orogastric tubes and nipples) is a major cause of infection. Clinical Signs. Severely affected animals or those at the beginning of an outbreak usually are found dead. Less acutely affected animals expel initially yellow, fluid feces that progressively become brownish and/or hemorrhagic. Feces may also contain flecks of blood and show splinting of the abdomen, especially when handled, along with signs of colic and feed refusal. The clinical course usually is short, and the disease is almost always fatal. One study reported acute abdominal pain, hemorrhagic diarrhea, and death within 24 hours of experimental oral inoculation of three goat kids with a field strain of C. perfringens type C. 75 Dehydration, anemia, and severe weakness are also common clinical signs in affected animals. Terminal convulsions and coma occasionally are noted, especially in outbreaks in the United States. C. perfringens type C in older sheep causes the disease known as \"struck.\" Affected animals usually are found dead or with signs of toxemia. Specific antemortem signs of gastrointestinal disease are rare. Specific antemortem signs of gastrointestinal disease are rare. Clinical pathology changes observed in these animals include neutrophilic leukocytosis with a left shift. Additional evidence of systemic toxemia (metabolic acidosis, azotemia, and increases in liver and muscle enzymes) also may be seen.",

A beta toxoid is available in the United States and other countries. It usually is packaged with an epsilon toxoid. The best protection is achieved by vaccinating pregnant dams twice, with the second dose administered approximately 3 to 4 weeks before lambing or kidding and annual booster. Deer does should receive double the dose of sheep as low antibody responses to clostridia have been reported in these animals. 77, 78 Vaccination of pregnant dams is directed to increase specific colostrum antibodies to protect neonates. Juveniles also should be vaccinated twice or three times at 2 months, 3 months, and 4 months. Adults, including males, should receive an annual booster. In the face of an outbreak, the lambing area should be moved to a different place. Additionally, vaccination of dams and newborns with a beta toxoid and administration of C. perfringens C and D antitoxin can be carried out in the face of an outbreak to reduce morbidity and mortality.",

            "text": "C. perfringens type D produces epsilon toxin (ETX), which is responsible for causing type D enterotoxemia in sheep, goats, calves, and deer. 79, 80 Other common names for the disease include \"overeating disease\" or \"pulpy kidney disease.\" The disease has a worldwide distribution and occurs primarily in suckling lambs of 1 to 10 weeks of age, although it has also been reported in weaned lambs up to 10 months of age and adult sheep. The disease is also common in grazing goats and deer. The prevalence of disease has been reported from 1.49 to 3.14%, with a 100% case fatality rate in feedlot lambs. 81 One study on proportional distribution of goatherd mortality in the province of Quebec, Canada, reported a 17.1% mortality of goats to C. perfringens type D enterotoxemia. 82 The disease is more common in feedlot lambs after they enter the lot. Tail docking, castration, and other management interventions are thought to decrease the incidence of this disease by temporarily decreasing appetite. The disease also affects unvaccinated adult sheep, even without any history of stressors or feed changes. Sudden changes in the diet are the main predisposing factor in goats. The disease can occur in vaccinated goats, as vaccination has not demonstrated to be completely protective in this species. 83, 84 C. perfringens type D is normally found in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy ruminants, but the acid environment of the abomasum and continuous peristalsis help to keep numbers of bacteria and levels of toxin production low. However, under specific conditions such as overingestion of high-energy feeds (milk, grain, and lush pasture), excess of fermentable starches in the intestine, and intestinal stasis, the organism proliferates rapidly, producing lethal quantities of epsilon toxin. These conditions are usually triggered in well-conditioned, fast-growing animals that are on a highly nutritious diet. The epsilon toxin, once produced, acts locally, causing increasing gut permeability and widespread tissue damage. Epsilon toxin and other exotoxins are then absorbed through the intestinal tract into systemic circulation and transported to the brain, lungs, and kidneys, causing increased endothelial permeability, perivascular edema, and generalized necrosis. 79, 83 The characteristic increased vascular permeability and perivascular edema in the kidney and brain are responsible for the name of \"pulpy kidney disease\" and \"focal symmetric encephalomalacia.\" Clinical Signs. The course of the disease is usually very short (0.5-12 hours), so sudden or spontaneous death is a common clinical sign across affected small ruminant species. 80,84-86 Natural disease caused by C. perfringens type D differs between sheep and goats, possibly because of a difference in relative local and systemic actions of the epsilon toxin, although experimental models have demonstrated that both species develop similar lesions. 84, 87, 88 In sheep, systemic actions of the toxin leads to mostly neurological signs such as dullness, depression, ataxia, trembling, stiff limbs, opisthotonus, convulsions, frothy mouth, and rapid death. In goats, actions of the toxin appear to be more localized to the intestinal tract, causing enterocolitis, colic, diarrhea, dehydration, and occasional neurological signs. 85, 86 Necropsy Findings. Postmortem findings in sheep are characterized by edema of the brain, lungs, and heart in addition to hydropericardium. 89 Edema of the kidneys (pulpy kidney lesion) is inconsistent. Sheep usually demonstrated minor and inconsistent intestinal changes. 89 Other lesions reported in cattle and deer include hemorrhages on the epicardium, thymus, and diaphragm and petechial hemorrhages in the jejunal mucosa. 80, 90 Necropsy lesions reported in goats include pseudomembranous enterocolitis with mucosal ulceration, as well as fibrin, blood clots, and watery contents in the bowel lumen. Evidence of systemic toxemia, including multifocal petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhage, proteinaceous exudates in body cavities, pulmonary edema, hydropericardium, and cerebral malacia with perivascular cuffing, have also been reported in goats and affected deer. 80, 84, 87, 88, 91 Clinical Pathology. Characteristic clinicopathological changes include pronounced hyperglycemia and glucosuria, which are considered a hallmark of C. perfringens D enterotoxemia. 86 Additionally, neutrophilic leukocytosis with a left shift and evidence of systemic toxemia (metabolic acidosis, azotemia, and increases in liver and muscle enzymes) also may be seen.",

            "text": "Prevention. Vaccination of pregnant ewes with two doses of toxoid, with the second dose given 3 to 4 weeks before lambing, and adequate ingestion of colostrum are the best methods of protecting newborn lambs. Vaccination of older lambs should occur before exposure to diets rich in carbohydrates (grain-feedlot settings) or lush pastures. In these cases, lambs should be vaccinated twice or three times around 2, 3, and 4 months of age. Males and adult females that are not part of the breeding program may be vaccinated annually. Vaccination has been shown to protect goats from experimental disease, but clinical evidence suggests that well-vaccinated goats are still susceptible to developing clostridial enteritis. The toxoids may not protect against local action of the toxins in the goat, which appears to play a greater role in their disease than it does in the sheep. 84, 87, 88 More frequent vaccination (every 6 months) in goats is suggested to increase protection. The adjuvant present in some multivalent clostridial vaccines may cause subcutaneous reactions that may lead to abscess formation. In the face of an outbreak, immediate mass administration of C and D antitoxin (200 IU/kg) in addition to vaccination is recommended. 92 Nonenteric Clostridial Infections C. novyi, C. septicum, C. chauvoei, and C. sordelli have been identified as causal agents of severe muscle, liver, and abomasal necrosis in small ruminants and cervid species. 66, [93] [94] [95] These organisms are usually present in the soil and environment and in the gastrointestinal tract and liver of healthy ruminants. 66 Pathogenesis is usually facilitated by trauma of affected tissues, local multiplication of the organism, local and systemic damage by exotoxin production, and ultimately death. 66, 96 Four types of C. novyi have been described, A, B, C, and D. C. novyi type C is considered nontoxigenic and therefore is not associated with disease. C. novyi type A produces alpha toxin and is associated with wound infections and myonecrosis in cases of \"bighead\" and \"malignant edema.\" C. novyi type B produces alpha and beta toxins and is associated with infectious necrotic hepatitis or \"black disease.\" 97, 98 The temporal and geographic distributions of black disease resemble those of fascioliasis, with the highest incidence of disease in milder, moister months in many countries. Black disease is less common in sheep than in cattle and is rare in goats. 66, 96 C. novyi type D (C. haemolyticum) produces beta toxin and is associated with bacillary hemoglobinuria (red water disease). C. septicum produces alpha toxin and is associated with malignant edema and necrotic abomasitis (Braxy). C. chauvoei produces alpha and beta toxins and is associated with severe myonecrosis observed in blackleg and C. sordelli produces a hemolytic toxin associated with myonecrosis in cases of malignant edema and blackleg. 96, 97 ",

            "text": "Clinical Signs. The course of disease from first illness to death is short and never lasts more than a few hours in sheep. Therefore, peracute or sudden death is not uncommon in this species. Wellnourished adult sheep between 2 and 4 years are more commonly affected. The disease course is a little longer (1-2 days) in cattle and deer. 66, 95 Affected sheep are debilitated, fail to keep up with the flock, and exhibit generalized weakness, sternal recumbency, separation, and anorexia. Tachypnea and tachycardia may be seen; high fever (105-107\u00b0 F) occurs early in the disease. Clinical signs observed in cattle, goats, and deer are similar and may include severe depression, anorexia, abdominal distention, colic, ruminal stasis, and lateral recumbency. 66, 94, 95, 99, 100, 101 A report of black disease in a forest reindeer (Rangifer tarandus fennicus) described serosanguinous discharge from mucocutaneous orifices (nostrils and anus), periorbital edema, and nystagmus in addition to other clinical signs. 95 Necropsy Findings. Necropsy might be difficult due to rapid autolysis of tissues in affected animals. Severe venous congestion usually darkens the underside of the skin of affected animals, giving this disease its common name of \"black disease.\" Fluid in the pericardial sac, pleural space, and peritoneal cavity is usually present. 66 Endocardial and epicardial hemorrhages are a common finding. The liver is swollen and congested and on its diaphragmatic surface presents pale foci of coagulation necrosis; however, solid organs such as liver and kidneys could be in an advanced state of autolysis. Characteristic lesions of black disease in the liver are single or multiple yellow to white areas (1-2 cm in diameter) of necrosis surrounded by a bright hyperemic zone. 102 A recent report of black disease in a reindeer described moderate amounts of dark red thoracic and pericardial fluid, edema of the lungs and upper respiratory tract, swollen spleen, and several well-circumscribed areas of black discoloration in the liver. 95 Diagnosis. The most characteristic clinicopathological change is neutrophilic leukocytosis with a left shift. Additional evidence of systemic toxemia (metabolic acidosis, azotemia, and increases in liver and muscle enzymes) also may be seen; however, diagnosis of black disease is based on characteristic history (endemic liver fluke areas), clinical signs, and postmortem findings and testing. An impression smear of the margins of the liver might reveal large numbers of gram positive rods, but this is not definitively diagnostic. Anaerobic culture of C. novyi from typical liver lesions, in addition to demonstration of the alpha/beta toxins from peritoneal fluid or liver (fresh-refrigerated), through ELISA or PCR is required to establish final diagnosis. 98, 100 The use of fluorescent antibody and IHC for the identification of C. novyi on liver impression smear samples or other liver (formalin-fixed) samples have also been described. 95, 100 Treatment and Prevention. Treatment is rarely possible because of the fulminant clinical course of the disease; however, if treatment is attempted, high doses of penicillin G sodium (20,000-40,000 IU/kg) IV every 6 hours or oxytetracycline 10 mg/kg IV every 12 hours should be initiated. Supportive care, including IV fluids, nutritional support, and stress reduction, may be beneficial. In the face of an outbreak, vaccination of the whole herd/flock should be initiated immediately.",

            "text": "Pathogenesis. C. novyi type D (C. haemolyticum) is the etiologic agent associated with red water disease. C. haemolyticum is similar to other clostridial species in its life cycle and appears to thrive on alkaline soils and pastures with standing water. The disease tends to be seasonal occurring at times of high larval fluke migration. Similar to C. novyi B, C. haemolyticum colonizes the livers of healthy animals and proliferates after liver damage, including damage caused by migrating flukes (F. hepatica, Fascioloides magna, Dicrocoelium dendriticum, and C. tenuicollis), liver abscessation (Fusobacterium necrophorum or Trueperella pyogenes), or damage incurred during liver biopsy. 100, 103 Under ischemic conditions of the liver, spores of C. haemolyticum germinate and produce high amounts of beta toxin. The beta toxin causes localized hepatic necrosis and after reaching circulation induces severe intravascular hemolysis and damage of the capillary endothelium. 103 Intravascular hemolysis leads to rapid anemia and death due to anoxia. The disease is seen worldwide and is more commonly reported in sheep than in goats. Bacillary hemoglobinuria has been reported in a free-ranging elk calf (Cervus elaphus roosevelti) found dead in the southwest of the state of Washington, United States. 104 Clinical Signs. Bacillary hemoglobinuria usually affects wellnourished animals older than 1 year of age. 105, 106 In most cases, the disease is per-acute and sudden dead or found dead is the only sign. 103 In cases where signs are recognized antemortem, affected animals appear weak, depressed, and febrile (104-106\u00b0 F); blood or blood-tinged froth may be present in the nostrils; rectal bleeding and bloody feces may be present; and severe hemoglobinuria (dark red, port wine-colored urine) is usually observed. 105, 106 Blood appears thin and watery and mucous membranes are pale and icteric. Heart and respiratory rates are high and become much higher with any sort of effort or stress. Other terminal signs include bloat and the presence of blood in the nostrils, mouth, vagina, and rectum. Death occurs within hours to a few days after onset of clinical signs. 100 Necropsy Findings. Gross lesions include jaundice of mucous membranes and tissues and subcutaneous petechial/ecchymotic hemorrhages, edema, and emphysema. Marked autolysis of internal organs might prevent identification of typical lesions. Dark red urine is present in the bladder. 102 Lymph nodes and spleen are congested and hemorrhagic. Hemorrhagic abomasitis and enteritis might occur, as well as the presence of hemoglobin-stained transudate in pleural and peritoneal cavities and pericardial sac. Pulmonary edema is common. The pathognomonic lesion is the ischemic hepatic infarcts ranging from 5 to 30 cm in diameter with a hyperemic interface with healthy liver tissue. 100, 102 Diagnosis. Clinicopathological abnormalities usually include anemia, leukocytosis with mature neutrophilia, and degenerative left shift (immature forms of neutrophils and toxic changes) often is present. 106, 107 Serum biochemical evaluation may reveal increased levels of liver enzymes such as sorbitol dehydrogenase, GGT, aspartate aminotransferase, and increased indirect total serum bilirubin. [105] [106] [107] Presumptive diagnosis can be made on history, clinical sigs, clinicopathological abnormalities, and postmortem findings; however, similar to black disease, final diagnosis should be based on anaerobic culture of C. novyi from typical liver lesions in addition to demonstration of the beta toxins from peritoneal fluid or liver (fresh-refrigerated) through ELISA or PCR techniques. 98, 100, 104, 106 The use of fluorescent antibody and IHC for the identification of C. novyi on liver impression smears or other liver (formalin-fixed) samples has also been described. 95, 100 More recently, a PCR assay for the detection of C. novyi type D in cattle has been reported. 107 Treatment and Prevention. Treatment is rarely possible because of the fulminant clinical course of the disease; however, if treatment is attempted, high doses of penicillin G sodium (20,000-40,000 IU/kg) IV every 6 hours or oxytetracycline 10 mg/kg IV every 12 hours should be initiated. Supportive therapy should include the administration of IV fluids, blood transfusions, and antiinflammatory agents. Efforts to control liver flukes and prevent other causes of liver damage are most important. Administration of multivalent clostridial vaccines containing C. novyi is highly effective. Animals should be vaccinated every 6 months starting around 2 to 3 months of age and before parturition as protective immunity is short lived. In flocks at high risk for developing this disorder, a booster vaccine given 1 month before expected fluke exposure may provide additional protection. 100 Deer should be vaccinated in the same fashion as sheep, but double the vaccine dose for sheep should be used as these animals as they do not develop a strong antibody response to commercially available multivalent vaccines. 77, 78 Efforts to eliminate the organism from soil and environment are usually unrewarding but carcasses of animals dying from the disease should be burned, deeply buried, or removed from the premises.",

In the case of malignant edema, other tissue-invasive clostridia (C. chauvoei, C. sordelli, and C. perfringens A) have also been associated with this disease, and mixed infections are common. The pathogenesis of infection is often similar to that seen with bighead and blackleg: soil or fecal clostridial invasion of a contaminated wound. In sheep and goats, this disease has been reported following lambing/kidding, after shearing of tail docking. 100 C. septicum can also invade the abomasal lining of lambs, causing severe hemorrhagic, necrotic abomasitis known as braxy. 108 Activation of dormant bacteria in previously damaged tissue (myositis/abomasitis) similar to that seen in clostridial necrotic hepatitis also occurs. 108 In both cases (malignant edema and braxy), bacterial toxins precipitate local tissue necrosis and systemic toxemia. The alpha, beta, gamma, and delta toxins produced by C. septicum are lecithinase, deoxyribonuclease, hyaluronidase, and hemolysin, respectively. Commonly affected sites of malignant edema include castration, dehorning, and injection sites; the umbilicus; and the postpartum uterus. 100 Factors that promote braxy have not been identified, although it usually affects weaned and yearling lambs in the winter after ingestion of frozen feedstuffs implicated as initial causes of abomasitis. 100, 108 Both forms of the disease have worldwide distribution and are described more in sheep than in goats. 100, 108 Clinical Signs. Malignant edema is characterized by local lesion (wound) or regional pain characterized by swelling and edema that progressively becomes tense and dark (skin). High fever, signs of shock/toxemia, and frothy exudation of the wound are usually present. Evidence of subcutaneous gas production is less common in this infection than in blackleg. Uterine infection may cause a fetid vaginal discharge. Death occurs within hours to a few days after onset of clinical signs. 100 Braxy usually causes death before any abnormalities are noted. On rare occasions, signs of sudden onset of illness with high fever, abdominal distention, depression, colic, and recumbency may be seen before death. 100 Diagnosis. Characteristic clinicopathologic changes include neutrophilic leukocytosis with a left shift. A decrease in WBC and RBC counts also is possible because of the leukocidal and hemolytic effects of the toxins. Additional evidence of systemic toxemia (metabolic acidosis, azotemia, and increases in liver and muscle enzymes) also may be seen. Examination of a Gram-stained smear from the edematous swelling(s) or wound swabs could give an early diagnosis. One study reported the successful use of a PCR assay for the identification of bacteria associated with malignant edema in cattle, sheep, and other ruminants. 109 Postmortem changes with malignant edema include dark red, swollen muscle filled with hemorrhagic, proteinaceous exudate and little or no gas. With braxy, the abomasal wall is hemorrhagic and necrotic. Both diseases are associated with rapid postmortem decomposition of the carcass. Treatment and Prevention. Wound management and the rapid administration of high doses of penicillin (penicillin G sodium at 20,000-40,000 IU/kg IV every 6 hours) are important in treating malignant edema. Local treatment consists of surgical incision of the affected area to provide drainage and irrigation with peroxide. Injection of penicillin directly into or in the periphery of the lesions may help. Ancillary treatments such as IV fluids, antiinflammatory agents (e.g., flunixin meglumine, 2 mg/kg IV), and nutritional support may be necessary. Maintenance of good hygiene during procedures such as lambing, tail docking, shearing, castration, obstetric manipulation, and administering injections is helpful in preventing malignant edema. Multivalent clostridial toxoids may provide some protection and should be given annually to animals at risk for the disorder. 110",

Several species of clostridial organisms can cause myonecrosis in small ruminants. 93, 111, 112 The disease is acute to per-acute, has a short course of duration, and is usually fatal. C. chauvoei, C. septicum, and C. sordelli are commonly involved with clostridial myonecrosis in ruminants. [111] [112] [113] Blackleg can be enzootic in some areas or farms because of increased bacterial contamination and occurs more commonly in the warm months of the year. [113] [114] [115] Animals between 4 months and 3 years of age can be affected. 111, 112 C. chauvoei is the most important cause of blackleg. C. sordelli tends to be involved in the myonecrosis of older feedlot animals. 112 These organisms are found in the soil and can gain access to muscles after translocation from the gastrointestinal tract and liver into systemic circulation. Additionally, direct inoculation of the organisms by penetrating wounds or intramuscular injections has been suggested. Local tissue trauma, wounds, unsanitary procedures (i.e., shearing, tail docking, and castration), umbilical infection (neonates), or vaginal trauma from lambing can create perfect conditions for the germination of clostridial spores inducing rapid toxin synthesis and production. 113 In some cases, bacterial proliferation appears to occur in a site distant from the original wound (i.e., fetal infections after shearing of a ewe and myocardial necrosis in cattle and sheep). 113 Bacterial toxins cause severe local tissue necrosis, systemic toxemia, and ultimately death. As with braxy, several other strains of tissue-invasive clostridia can cause this disease and mixed infections are common.",

            "text": "Necropsy Findings. Rapid tissue autolysis is not uncommon in animals that succumb to clostridial myonecrosis. Bloodstained fluid and froth can be observed discharging from nostrils and anus. In small ruminants and especially sheep, affected muscle areas are more localized and deeper, brown to black discoloration is present, the subcutaneous edema is not as severe, and, although there is gas present, is not in such large amounts as in cattle. In cases of infection from skin wounds, the area demonstrates subcutaneous edema, swelling, and underlying muscle discoloration. In cases of infection through the urogenital tract, typical lesions are found in the perineal area, vagina, uterus, and fetus. Lung congestion, fibrinohemorrhagic pleuritis, pericarditis, myocardial damage, and bloat are also common findings. 111, 112 Diagnosis. It is rarely possible to obtain samples for clinicopathological analysis due to the per-acute course of the disease. If samples can be obtained, common findings include neutrophilic leukocytosis with a left shift. A decrease in WBC and RBC counts also is possible because of the leukocidal and hemolytic effects of the toxins. Additional evidence of systemic toxemia-metabolic acidosis, azotemia, and increases in liver and muscle enzymesalso may be seen. Presumptive diagnosis can be made from history, characteristic clinical signs, and gross pathology findings; however, aspirates or tissue specimens from affected muscles for direct smear examination, fluorescent antibody testing, or anaerobic culture are required for definitive diagnosis. 111, 112 A multiplex PCR is available for identification of pathogenic clostridia on fluid and tissue samples. 109 Treatment and Prevention. Aggressive antibiotic therapy (e.g., penicillin G sodium or potassium penicillin at 20,000-40,000 IU/kg IV every 6 hours), in combination with surgical debridement of affected tissues (fasciotomy), and supportive care (nutritional support, IV fluids, and antiinflammatory agents) are important within the treatment plan for clostridial myositis. Prognosis for treatment of all types of clostridial myositis cases is usually guarded to poor and depends on the duration and extension of the lesions. Maintaining excellent hygiene during invasive procedures such as castration, obstetric manipulation, shearing, tail docking, and administering injections is helpful in preventing blackleg. Multivalent clostridial toxoids may provide some protection and should be given to all animals starting at weaning time, before parturition, and annually. 114, 115 ",

The organism is very hardy, so infection can occur through direct contact or indirect contact with contaminated common instruments and facilities. Infection is usually introduced into a flock through acquisition of an infected animal, although it also can occur when a naive flock is moved into a contaminated area. Horses, cattle, and humans also are minor hosts. Infection is thought to occur after ingestion, inhalation, or wound contamination. Except for lower respiratory tract invasion, a surface break is thought to be necessary. Contaminated shears, tail-docking knives, and emasculators readily spread the organisms through a flock. Abscesses can form at the site of invasion or more commonly at the site of the local lymph node. Clinical Signs. Clinical signs of external abscesses include surface swellings and draining lesions. Drainage may be intermittent and usually consists of thick, yellow-white purulent material. Internal abscesses are more difficult to diagnose. Thoracic masses may cause inspiratory dyspnea or occlude venous return to the heart. Abdominal lesions may cause tenesmus, stranguria, and occasionally colic. The most common sign of internal abscesses is weight loss with or without intermittent fever. Common external sites include the submandibular or retromandibular space and the preinguinal, prefemoral, and supramammary lymph nodes.

Hypodermic needles and equipment used for tail-docking, castrating, or disbudding animals may be important in iatrogenic transmission.

A similar proliferation of organisms may occur in chronically infected animals after temporary immune suppression. The humoral and cellular immune responses against A. ovis lead to opsonization of parasitized erythrocytes and their removal by cells of the reticuloendothelial system; M. ovis infection is thought to cause more intravascular hemolysis. The result in both cases is hemolytic anemia. 117 The protozoon parasites Babesia ovis and Babesia motasi have similar life cycles and cause similar diseases, but they have been eradicated and are reportable in the United States.

Some trypanosomes tend to invade extravascular spaces, such as the ocular aqueous humor and cerebrospinal fluid. The pathogenicity of trypanosomes varies with the different host species.

Examination of the buffy coat of centrifuged blood with darkfield phase-contrast spore illumination is the most sensitive direct microscopic method and is useful when parasite numbers are low. Pathogenic trypanosomes must be distinguished from more ubiquitous, nonpathogenic species particularly common in cattle, such as Trypanosoma theileri. Repeated blood sampling in individual animals often is necessary, because as noted, parasitemia is intermittent. The diagnosis is supported by evidence of anemia on a CBC.

Other signs include excessive salivation and hyperemia or cyanosis of the oral mucosa, including the tongue (hence the name bluetongue). Affected sheep often produce profuse serous nasal discharge that soon becomes mucopurulent and produces crusts and excoriations around the nose and muzzle. Oral lesions progress to petechial hemorrhages, erosions, and ulcers. Pulmonary edema is often severe, and pneumonia may develop. Skin lesions can progress to localized dermatitis.

The virus can be isolated from blood, semen, or tissues (spleen and brain from aborted fetuses). Viral isolation from blood obtained during the viremic state is the most definitive means of diagnosis. Serologic evaluation involves two types of viral antigen groups called P7 and P2. The former is found in all bluetongue viruses, and the latter determines the serotype. Sera are commonly tested with complement fixation, agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID), or one of several ELISA tests. A competitive ELISA is considered the best serologic test for detecting group antibodies to bluetongue virus. A direct fluorescent antibody test is available. Molecular tests (e.g., PCR) for bluetongue have recently become available and are extremely sensitive and specific. They can be useful for distinguishing serotypes. Other clinicopathologic signs that aid in diagnosis include leukopenia during the early febrile stage of the disease and an increase in serum CK corresponding to the latter phase of muscle stiffness and lameness.",

The virus is structurally related to bluetongue virus, and the pathogenesis and clinical signs of disease resulting from these two viral infections are very similar. At least seven distinct serotypes of EHDV are recognized, although formal classification of serotypes has yet to be finalized. Only two serotypes (EHDV1 and EHDV2) have historically circulated throughout North America, and those serotypes are largely considered to be endemic in almost all areas of the United States, with the exception of the northeast and arid areas of the southwest. However, in 2006, EHDV6 was isolated from surveillance efforts in dead white-tailed deer. 124 Since then, EHDV6 has been increasingly identified from both surveillance samples and clinical cases and is also believed to be endemic in several regions. 125 Pathogenesis. Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is a noncontagious disease that is transmitted by the Culicoides biting midges. Culicoides sonorensis is the primary vector of EHDV in the United States, although other species are also suspected to transmit the disease based on the geographic distribution of clinical cases, although this has yet to be formally shown. Due to the vector-borne route of transmission, peak incidence of the disease is closely associated with peak vector population, namely, in the late summer and fall of the year.",

Within a few days, infected animals develop nasal and lacrimal discharge, depression, thirst, anorexia, and leukopenia. Congestion of the conjunctival and other mucous membranes occurs, followed by serous and mucopurulent exudates. Sheep and goats develop oral erosions with necrotic foci, which results in excessive salivation. Diarrhea that may be profuse but rarely hemorrhagic develops within 2 to 3 days and is accompanied by abdominal pain, tachypnea, emaciation, and severe dehydration. Bronchopneumonia, particularly that caused by Pasteurella spp., may be a terminal \u2022 Fig. 16.1 A.

Death usually occurs 5 to 10 days after the onset of fever. Pregnant sheep or goats with PPR may abort. Diagnosis. A presumptive diagnosis of PPR can be made on the basis of clinical, pathologic, and epizootiologic findings. The diagnosis can be confirmed by isolating the virus from blood or tissues, including lymph nodes, tonsils, spleen, and lung. Immunocapture ELISA or PCR may be used to detect infection several days before the development of clinical disease. Most serologic tests (complement fixation or AGID) cannot differentiate between PPR and rinderpest. Characteristic postmortem findings include necrotic stomatitis that is generally confined to the inside of the lower lip and adjacent gum, the cheeks near the commissures, and the ventral surface of the free portion of the tongue. Abomasal erosions are often present. In the small intestine, Peyer's patches are markedly affected, particularly in the first portion of the duodenum and terminal ileum. The large intestine may be severely affected. Lesions occurring near the ileocecal valve, at the cecocolic junction, and in the rectum are often described as zebra stripes that indicate areas of congestion along the folds of the mucosa. Treatment and Prevention. Infection with PPRV has no specific treatment. Mortality can be reduced by supportive care, including the administration of antimicrobial and antiinflammatory agents, as well as nutritional support. In the United States, state and federal veterinarians should be notified if PPRV is suspected. Methods used to eradicate rinderpest are useful in the eradication and control of PPR. All sick sheep and goats and those exposed should be slaughtered and disposed of by burning, burying, or rendering. The premises should be decontaminated, and the area quarantined. Sheep and goats can be protected against PPR by immunization with rinderpest vaccines or by the simultaneous administration of PPR hyperimmune bovine serum and virulent PPRV. 127",

Tissue damage and inflammation are often compounded by secondary bacterial infection, which can cause greater morbidity and mortality than the original viral infection. Morbidity is related to feed refusal, increased recumbency, and secondary infections of the mouth, udder, and feet. Clinical Signs. Sheep and goats usually develop minor lesions, if any, and are more important in many outbreaks as transport or multiplying hosts than as primary clinical cases. However, identification of lesions should raise suspicion of this disorder. In the worst cases, vesicles, erosions, and ulcers are seen at target sites. They may appear mildly inflamed and erythematous; if they are infected, they may appear severely inflamed with hemorrhage and necrosis. Other signs vary according to the location and severity of the lesions. Lingual and buccal lesions cause salivation, dysphagia, and feed refusal. Foot lesions, which are the most common clinical manifestation in small ruminants, cause lameness and recumbency. Teat lesions cause reluctance to be milked or nursed and a decrease in production. Fever also may be seen early in the disease, when vesicles are most apparent. The fever then usually abates, and vesicles are replaced by erosions or ulcers. Abortion may occur, especially with foot-and-mouth disease, and is probably related to the fever rather than to fetal infection. The disease is usually self-limiting; most animals recover within 2 to 3 weeks. Shedding of the virus causing vesicular stomatitis is thought to subside soon after healing of lesions.

CAEV produces four clinical syndromes: encephalomyelitis, arthritis, interstitial pneumonia, and indurative mastitis. The pattern of disease usually varies with age. Arthritis is generally seen in sexually mature goats, whereas encephalomyelitis is generally seen in kids 2 to 4 months old. Interstitial pneumonia and indurative mastitis are more common in adult goats. Some goats suffer from a wasting disorder characterized by poor body condition and rough hair coat. Diagnosis. A presumptive diagnosis of CAEV can be made on the basis of history and clinical signs suggestive of one or more of the syndromes. In general, ELISA tests are better for detecting disease in an individual animal because the sensitivity of the test is higher than that of the AGID, whereas the AGID is better for herd screening that requires high specificity. With the AGID test, false negatives may occur in goats that have not yet seroconverted to recent infection. Individual goats may take months or years to seroconvert or may never do so. Parturition or advanced stages of disease also may contribute to a false-negative result. False positives may occur in goats younger than 90 days old that have colostral antibodies. For this reason, it is often suggested that kids be at least 6 months old before they are tested. PCR testing has high specificity and sensitivity and can detect infection within a day of exposure. Other less commonly used tests include a Western blot to detect antibodies and a Northern blot to look for mitochondrial RNA.

Infection is established in the monocyte and macrophage cell line and spread by these cells to the lungs, lymph nodes, choroid plexus, spleen, bone marrow, mammary gland, and kidneys. Like CAEV, OPPV evades the cellular and humoral immune system of the host by incorporation of its provirus in host DNA, low-grade replication of virus only when monocytes differentiate into macrophages (restricted replication), and production of antigenic variants that are not neutralized by existing antibodies. Continual antigenic stimulation of the host by low-grade replication of OPPV results in chronic inflammation and resultant lymphoid proliferation in various target tissues.

The hallmark lesion is hypomyelination, or degeneration of oligodendroglial cells. Three factors contribute to this lesion. The first is direct viral damage. The second is viral-induced inhibition of the thyroid gland that causes decreased secretion of thyroid hormones. In the absence of these hormones, a resultant lowered concentration of a specific nucleotide in the central nervous system also contributes to the hypomyelination. The third factor is altered immune function. The virus causes the host to produce a virus-specific delayed hypersensitivity reaction that causes inflammation in the central nervous system.

Congenital malformations are seen at birth. Lambs have abnormal fleece characteristics (hairy rather than woolly in consistency), small stature, domed heads, shortened legs, and dark pigmentation of the skin, particularly on the dorsal aspect of the neck. The lamb may exhibit tonic-clonic tremors (\"hairy shakers\") when awake, which may prevent standing or suckling. Most of these lambs die within a few days of birth. If they survive, the hair changes disappear in 9 to 12 weeks and the central nervous system signs resolve by 20 weeks.
