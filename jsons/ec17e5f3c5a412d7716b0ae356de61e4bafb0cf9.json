This virus emerged in the human population in the final months of 2019 from a, so far 26 unidentified, animal reservoir and has since spread across the globe (1). The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic 27 poses an enormous burden on society, economic and healthcare systems worldwide, and various 28 measures are being taken to control its spread. Many of these measures critically depend on the timely 29 and accurate diagnosis of virus-infected individuals. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain 30 reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive and specific assay and therefore preferred (2, 3). Whereas 31 many COVID-19 RT-PCR kits are currently commercially available, an independent assessment of these 32 products is not yet publicly available and direly needed to guide implementation of accurate tests in 33 a diagnostic market that is flooded with new tests.

Most of the selected kits are CE-IVD certified and 51 can be produced in large quantities. Using a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 RNA we determine the 95% 52 limit of detection (LOD95%) for each of these assays. In addition, a concise panel of clinical samples 53 (n=22) was run to provide a first indication of clinical sensitivity and specificity. Although some kits 54 appeared to perform better than others at identifying clinical samples at very low concentrations of 55 SARS-CoV-2 RNA, all tests were able to identify positive samples with Ct\u226434.5 in our in-house E-gene 56 PCR.

Promising commercial kits were selected based on: 1) listing on 64 the FindDx website; 2) responsiveness to requests; 3) accessible information (in English); 4) 65 compatibility with different PCR platforms; 5) considerable production capacity. Notably, all of the 66 PCR kits that we had selected for our analysis have in the meantime also been selected for the first 67 round of independent evaluation by FIND (www.finddx.org/covid-19/sarscov2-eval-molecular/, April 68 2020).

Target genes for each RT-PCR 72 kit were available in the assay documentation or upon request (for an overview, see Table 1 ). All PCRs were run on a LightCycler 480 II (LC480II, Roche) and performed according to the manufacturer's 74 instructions for use.

To provide an indication on clinical relevance of this finding: from our in-153 house diagnostic data on patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms, it appears that from all 154 individuals testing positive for our in-house E-gene PCR (n=416) the proportion of individuals with a 155 Ct value >34.5 is approximately 3.6% (unpublished data). The R-Biopharm AG kit positively identified 156 the highest number of clinical samples, i.e. 13 out of 16, comparable with our in-house PCR. Three kits 157 were able to positively identify 12 out of 16 samples (BGI, KH Medical, Seegene). Notably, we 158 performed our analysis using only a small number of clinical samples and we therefore advise that 159 diagnostic laboratories in the field conduct additional and more extensive in-house clinical validations 160 upon implementation of novel RT-PCR kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity 161 towards a panel of other respiratory (corona)viruses, except for the expected cross-reactivity with the 162 SARS-CoV-1 E-gene. Since the latter virus is no longer known to be circulating in the human population, 163 we consider this cross-reactivity acceptable. 164Considering our findings, we believe that all of the commercially available RT-PCR kits included in this 165 study can be used for routine diagnostics of symptomatic COVID-19 patients. When performing virus 166 diagnostics in populations that may be expected to display low viral loads, such as health-care workers 167 with mild or no symptoms or patients during later stages of the infection (6), it might be advisable to 168 use those kits that performed best regarding the positive identification of clinical samples, i.e. RT-PCR 169 kits from R-Biopharm AG, BGI, KH Medical, and Seegene.",
