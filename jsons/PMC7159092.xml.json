            "text": "Viruses require cellular membranes in one or more steps of their infection cycle for replication, assembly and/or release, and therefore they have developed sophisticated mechanisms to opportunistically rearrange host membranes for their needs. For example, a common feature among positive (+) strand RNA viruses is the assembly of their replication\u2013transcription complexes (RTCs) in association with cytoplasmic membranes (Salonen et al., 2005; Miller and Krijnse\u2010Locker, 2008). The potential benefit of anchoring the RTCs to lipid bilayers is still unclear, but it may facilitate and co\u2010ordinate different steps of the viral life cycle, and/or delay induction of the host immune response (Ahlquist, 2006; Haller et al., 2006). Enveloped viruses are another example; they generate their new virions by budding through cellular membranes (Garoff et al., 1998).",

These nsp's collectively form the RTCs and induce the formation of cytoplasmic DMVs into which the RTCs are anchored (Ziebuhr et al., 2000).

The presence of DMVs and virions was the obvious morphological changes described at that time. These initial observations have successively been corroborated by numerous studies. More recently, other membranous rearrangements have been described. An electron tomography analysis of SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells has confirmed the presence of reticular inclusions in between DMVs (Knoops et al., 2008), which were already reported in one of the original works (David\u2010Ferreira and Manaker, 1965). The recent study has proposed that these reticular inclusions, re\u2010named CMs, are the precursors of DMVs (Knoops et al., 2008). In addition to CMs, it has been shown that the CoV triggers the formation of highly organized crystalloid conformations, tubular rearrangements and vacuoles enclosing viral particles that have been named CMSs, TBs and LVCVs respectively (David\u2010Ferreira and Manaker, 1965; Ruebner et al., 1967; Tooze et al., 1984; Ng et al., 2003; Goldsmith et al., 2004; Almsherqi et al., 2005; Knoops et al., 2008).",

A major difficulty in understanding the role of these different structures has been the absence of a quantitative and qualitative EM analyses over time that could help ordering them during the infection cycle. We have now filled this gap by performing a time\u2010course EM and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) examination of MHV\u2010infected cells. By combining these qualitative and quantitative data with the measurement of viral RNA synthesis, viral protein production and progeny virus release, we have, for the first time, integrated ultrastructural analyses with molecular information. This approach has allowed us to establish that MHV induces the formation of six membranous rearrangements in the following order: DMVs, CMs, virions, LVCVs, TBs and CMSs. Importantly, we were able to show that most membrane rearrangements (LVCVs, TBs, CMSs and possibly CMs) observed in addition to the key structures in the infection (DMVs and virions) actually appear to be the consequence of a massive synthesis of viral proteins. In particular, LVCVs are ERGIC/Golgi compartments that expand to accommodate an increasing production of virions. All together, our study provides an overall comprehensive picture of the ultrastructural events taking place inside a cell in the course of a CoV infection.",

In order to be able to correlate our EM and IEM analyses with the progression of a CoV infection inside the host cells, we first measured important known parameters that reflect the CoV life cycle: viral RNA replication/transcription, viral protein synthesis and secretion of progeny virus.",

Both gRNA and sgRNA N were already detected at 2 h post infection (p.i.; Fig. 1A). Their amount gradually increased until the 9 h time point, after which the levels remained constant, resulting from a decline in RNA synthesis (Sawicki et al., 2007). At each time, the amount of sgRNA was about 100\u2010fold higher than that of gRNA. This analysis allowed us to ascertain that the observed changes in the levels of gRNA and sgRNA synthesis are identical to those measured using similar or different assays in various cell lines infected with diverse CoV (Sethna and Brian, 1997; Versteeg et al., 2006; Sawicki et al., 2007).",

The synthesis of the M protein was already detectable at 3 h p.i. and continued to increase until 8 h p.i. with the main increase occurring between 4 and 6 h p.i. (Fig. 1B). Essentially, identical results were obtained when we analysed the production of the structural proteins S and N in the same way (data not shown). This correlates perfectly with the synthesis kinetics of the sgRNA (Fig. 1A) and consequently indicates that these mRNAs are immediately available for translation. After 8 h of infection, we observed a drop in the production of the M protein (Fig. 1B). These results again correspond with those of others (Rottier et al., 1981; Hilton et al., 1986; Tahara et al., 1994).",

            "text": "As a first ultrastructural analysis, we compared the morphology of cells at 0 h p.i. with that of those at 8 h p.i. by EM in order to make a repertoire of all the membranous rearrangements that MHV induces. We identified six different structures. The most abundant of them were large vesicles with an average diameter of 200\u2013350 nm, which are limited by a double\u2010membrane and often were clustered together (Fig. 2A and B; and Fig. S1A, arrows). These are the characteristic DMVs induced by CoV (Svoboda et al., 1962; David\u2010Ferreira and Manaker, 1965; Ruebner et al., 1967; Pedersen et al., 1999; Gosert et al., 2002; Snijder et al., 2006; Knoops et al., 2008). Surprisingly, most of the observed DMVs appeared to have an invagination, which, from time to time, was associated to what looked as a small vesicle with a diameter of 50\u2013100 nm (Fig. S1B, arrow). This structural peculiarity is cell type\u2010specific because it was also observed in MHV\u2010A59\u2010infected mouse embryonic fibroblasts (data not shown) but not in mouse LR7 cells (Knoops et al., 2008). In the centre of the DMV clusters, we frequently observed a small network of membranes with a diameter varying from 200 to 600 nm, which have recently been described in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells and called CMs [Fig. 2A and B, arrowheads; (Knoops et al., 2008). The CMs were often in close proximity of the ER (< 10\u201320 nm distance), and sometimes appeared to be connected with this organelle (Fig. S1C, arrow). Virions were the third structure that we identified. These dark circular structures with a diameter of 70\u2013110 nm were found in the lumen of either a stack of adjacent cisternae, very likely the Golgi, or what appeared to be secretory vesicles (Fig. 2C) as well as extracellularly (Fig. S1D) in complete agreement with their known assembly and secretion mechanisms. The virions were also observed inside large circular organelles with a diameter of approximately 450\u2013750 nm (Fig. 2D, arrow). Interestingly, we observed virion particles assembling by invagination at the limiting membrane of these compartments through a process identical to the one occurring at the ERGIC (Fig. 2D, arrow). Because similar organelles have previously been described (Ng et al., 2003; Goldsmith et al., 2004; Knoops et al., 2008), we called them in the same way: the LVCVs. The fifth conformation that we detected was a condensed rearrangement of membranes with a diameter of approximately 300\u2013650 nm but without an apparent ultrastructural organization, which seemed to be connected to the ER (Fig. 2E). These structures have already been described a long time ago and called TBs (David\u2010Ferreira and Manaker, 1965). The sixth classified structure was a rectangular, extended (up to 850 nm in length) and highly organized membranous conformation always continuous to what appeared to be a swollen ER cisterna (Fig. 2F, arrow; the arrowhead indicates the swollen ER). A morphologically similar subcellular arrangement has been observed in SARS\u2010CoV infected cell sections and consequently, we also called these structures CMS (Almsherqi et al., 2005; Almsherqi et al., 2009).",

DMVs were already observed at 2 h p.i. in about 10 % of the cell sections and the number of cell sections positive for these vesicles gradually increased over time (Fig. 3B). The average number of DMVs per cell section reached a maximum, e.g. 16 DMVs/cell section, at 8 h p.i. (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the localization and morphology of the DMVs changed during the infection. At early time points, from 2 to 4 h p.i., DMVs were small (190\u2013250 nm diameters) with a regular circular shape and distributed throughout the cytoplasm. From 5 h onwards, DMVs organized in clusters mostly found in the perinuclear region of the cell. The DMV invaginations became more pronounced at 6 h p.i. after which the small vesicles located in their interior also became more prominent (Fig. S1B, arrow). Two hours later, the shape of the DMVs started to change acquiring a less circular form and with protuberances emerging from their surface that entered invaginations of adjacent DMVs (Fig. S1E, arrows).",

The virions were mostly observed in the Golgi cisternae at 5 h p.i. in agreement with the fact that MHV particles assemble at the ERGIC and are released into the extracellular space by passing through the secretory pathway (Ng et al., 2003; Stertz et al., 2007). LVCVs became detectable at 6 h p.i. (Fig. 3H) in coincidence with a more than twofold increase in the number of virions per cell profile (Fig. 3I). This observation suggested that the formation of LVCVs is probably induced by a higher production of virions in the cells. The TBs also became visible at 6 h p.i. (Fig. 3J). The number of TB\u2010positive cell sections increased during time as well as the size of these structures (Fig. 3K), with an average diameter of 200\u2013300 nm at 6 h p.i. to one of about 650 nm at 10 h p.i. Initially, each infected cell profile contained only one TB but, after 8 h p.i., we occasionally observed more than one TB per cell section. The CMSs, in contrast, were even more rare (observed in only 1% of the cells) and only detectable after 9 h p.i.; hence a significant statistical analysis could not be performed. We concluded that the TBs and the CMSs are not required for the early steps of the MHV infection cycle but rather the result of an advanced infection.",

Importantly, we discovered that these nsp's were also present in the CMs but not in the other MHV\u2010induced structures (Fig. 4A\u2013C and Fig. S3A\u2013H). The N protein was also distributed on both DMVs and CMs (Fig. 4D) suggesting a possible direct relationship between these two structures. Like the two other structural proteins, i.e. M and E, the N protein was found in virions present in the Golgi complex and LVCVs (Fig. 4E\u2013H). The M and E proteins were additionally observed in the limiting membrane of the Golgi cisternae but not on other MHV induced membranous rearrangements (Fig. S3). Interestingly, we discovered that the TBs contain the E protein but are negative for the other tested viral proteins (Fig. 4I, Fig. S3A and C). This result, plus the fact that the TBs appear at the late stage of the MHV infection (Fig. 3J and K), indicates that they could be generated by self\u2010assembly, possibly in the ER, of high levels of E protein. This hypothesis is sustained by the observation that the individual expression of the E protein induces the formation of a complex of tubular and smooth membranes with morphology reminiscent to that of the TBs (Raamsman et al., 2000).",

It has been shown that Golgi cisternae can increase in size in order to accommodate large luminal cargo proteins such as collagen (Bonfanti et al., 1998). Therefore, we hypothesized that LVCVs are Golgi cisternae that have expanded to increase their capacity to contain a higher number of viral proteins and/or forming virions. To sustain this notion, we first examined if the Golgi changes its organization and subcellular distribution during the course of an MHV infection. We took advantage of the HeLa\u2010GalNAcT2\u2010GFP stable cell line (Storrie et al., 1998), which expresses the fluorescent Golgi protein marker GalNActT2\u2010GFP, and inoculated these cells with MHV\u2010Srec before analysing them by IF at 0, 8 and 16 h p.i. The presence of viral proteins and virions in the Golgi was assessed using anti\u2010M protein antibodies. In non\u2010infected cells, the Golgi appeared as a juxtanuclear concentration of ribbon\u2010like structures as expected (Fig. 6A, upper panel; Storrie et al., 1998). The MHV infection caused three major changes, which were already detectable at 8 h p.i. but became more prominent at 16 h p.i. (Fig. 6A, middle and lower panels). First, the Golgi lost its compact organization; the organelle was scattered throughout the cytoplasm. Second, the intensity of the GalNAcT2\u2010GFP signal in the Golgi decreased. Third, GalNAcT2\u2010GFP appeared to partially localize to the ER. To unravel the effects of MHV infection on the Golgi at the ultrastructural level, the same samples were also processed in parallel for IEM and immunolabelled with anti\u2010GFP antibodies. At 0 h p.i the GalNAcT2\u2010GFP was exclusively concentrated in the Golgi complex, where it distributes into several cisternae (Fig. 6B). In contrast, at 16 h p.i., the labelling was found onto two different types of structures. The first were fragmented Golgi complexes (Fig. 6C). This morphological change during an MHV infection phenomenon has previously been reported (Lavi et al., 1996). The second types of labelled structures were LVCVs, in keeping with our notion that these compartments have an ERGIC/Golgi origin (Fig. 6D).",

In agreement with this notion but also with previous studies (Gosert et al., 2002; Snijder et al., 2006; Stertz et al., 2007; Knoops et al., 2008), we found that the tested components of the RTCs, i.e. nsp2, nsp3, nsp4 and nsp8, localize to DMVs (Fig. 4) and that viral RNA production becomes detectable simultaneous with the appearance of DMVs (2 h p.i.; Fig. 1A). Moreover, the RNA levels correlate with the number of DMVs throughout the course of the MHV infection (Fig. S5). A particularly interesting observation was that the production of RNA reaches a steady\u2010state coincident with a diminution in the generation of DMVs (Fig. 1A, Fig. 3C and D, Fig. S5). This observation could support a new concept in which viral RNA synthesis is dictated by the number of DMVs (and thus RTCs) rather than by, or in addition to, the regulation of the rate of RNA replication and transcription. Alternatively, depletion of one or more host factors required for DMV biogenesis could lead to an identical outcome. Obviously, future studies are necessary to address this issue.",

This characteristic has not previously been documented perhaps because it is cell type specific. Yet, it may provide valuable information about the DMV biogenesis. The small vesicles could carry newly synthesized viral proteins and/or host components to DMVs. Alternatively; these profiles may also represent the fusion events between DMVs described for the SARS\u2010CoV (Knoops et al., 2008). Unfortunately, the Tokuyasu cryosectioning technique that we have used for our IEM analyses does not allow the preservation of inner content of the DMVs and the small vesicles intimately associated with them (Fig. 4D, E and I, Fig. S2B and H, Fig. S3B, C and E; Gosert et al., 2002; Snijder et al., 2006; Stertz et al., 2007). Hence, we could not determine the presence of viral proteins and double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA) in these small vesicles.",

            "text": "It has recently been proposed that CMs are the site of generation of DMVs (Knoops et al., 2008). Our data showing that the CMs have the same viral protein composition as the DMVs may support this hypothesis (Fig. 4A\u2013E, Table 1). In addition, they reinforce the model (Knoops et al., 2008) that CMs are also involved in the replication and transcription of the viral RNA. As already observed (Knoops et al., 2008), however, the CMs appear after DMV formation (Fig. 3B and D). Because of this observation, we favour the idea that CMs are unlikely to be the precursor structure of DMVs. Potentially, they could originate from the DMVs but we never observed continuity between these two structures. Another possibility is that CMs are structures generated either for nsp's storage or by accumulation of excess nsp's that cannot be incorporated into DMVs. The possibility that the DMV biogenesis could require host components makes it possible that depletion of these components causes an accumulation of the newly synthesized transmembrane nsp's in the ER (Harcourt et al., 2004; Kanjanahaluethai et al., 2007; Oostra et al., 2007; Oostra et al., 2008), which leads to a clustering of RTCs at this site that results in the formation of CMs. In accordance with this hypothesis, CMs are frequently connected with the ER (Fig. S1C; Knoops et al., 2008). In addition, their size increases over time especially after 7 h p.i. when DMV formation slows down. It remains to be investigated whether CMs are able to synthesize viral RNA and to eventually pack dsRNA into their interior, which seems not to be the case so far (Knoops et al., 2008).",

            "text": "As expected, the virions were positive for the structural proteins, M, E and N, but not for the nsp's (Fig. 4 and Fig. S2, Table 1). Their immunolabelling with the anti\u2010E protein antiserum, however, was weak, consistent with the low number of E proteins per virion (Vennema et al., 1996; de Haan and Rottier, 2006). In agreement with the previous literature about their formation and release, virions were seen assembling in the ERGIC/Golgi (Fig. 2C) and complete viral particles were present in these organelles but also in secretory vesicles and the extracellular space (Fig. 4G, Fig. 5A, Fig. 6C, Fig. S1D). These observations were first recorded at 5 h p.i. (Fig. 5F and G). From 6 h p.i., virions were also forming and contained in the LVCVs (Fig. 2D, Fig. 3H and I, Fig. 4E, F and H, Fig. 5B\u2013D, Fig. 6D, Fig. S2A and C, Table 1). LVCVs have already been described in SARS\u2010infected cells (Ng et al., 2003; Goldsmith et al., 2004; Knoops et al., 2008) and the observation that viral particles assemble at the limiting membrane of these compartments has led us to hypothesize and to show that they have a Golgi origin (5, 6). The enlargement of the ERGIC/Golgi compartments that leads to the formation of the LVCVs is probably a consequence of the accumulation of massive amounts of viral proteins and/or luminal virions that require an expansion of this organelle to accommodate them. This phenomenon has already been reported in the case of large cargo molecules passing through the Golgi (Bonfanti et al., 1998). It cannot be excluded a priori, however, that an overloading in viral proteins causes a fusion of the Golgi cisternae, which results in the LVCV formation. The fact that the secretory pathway is flooded by viral components is also emphasized by the formation of virions in the ER from 8 h p.i. (Fig. S6). The labelling efficiency of LVCVs for ERGIC and Golgi protein markers, however, was reduced as compared with that of the same organelles in non\u2010infected cells (Fig. 6B and Fig. S4B\u2013D). These observations indicate that some of the standard Golgi functions of this compartment are probably altered by the high content of viral components. This is exemplified by the observation that the Golgi cisternae fragment and the Golgi protein marker GalNAcT2\u2010GFP partially localizes to the ER during the course of an MHV infection (Fig. 6A and C). In addition, the secretion of Gaussia luciferase is reduced during MHV infection (Verheije et al., 2008). Nevertheless, the LVCVs are functional structures because the extracellular release of MHV is still effective at the advanced stages of the MHV infection when numerous LVCVs are present in each cell (Fig. 1C, Fig. 3H and I). LVCVs are probably not an organelle exclusively induced by CoVs, as LVCV\u2010like structures have also been observed in cells infected with the (+) RNA rubellavirus (Risco et al., 2003; Novoa et al., 2005), which also assembles its progeny virions in association with the Golgi compartment.",

These observations indicate that they are the result of the massive production of viral proteins that cannot be incorporated into the virions (Fig. 7B). The TBs are only positive for the E protein but not for the nsp's, the N and the M protein (Fig. S2D\u2013E, Fig. S3A and C; Table 1). We cannot formally exclude that they also contain the S protein but it is unlikely because the individual expression of the E protein is sufficient to induce the formation of a complex of smooth tubular membranes with morphology reminiscent to that of the TBs (Raamsman et al., 2000). The E protein is a transmembrane component that is inserted in the ER before being transported to the ERGIC/Golgi (Lim and Liu, 2001; Corse and Machamer, 2003) that is also able to self\u2010interact (Raamsman et al., 2000; Von brunn et al., 2007). Importantly, even if not positive for the ER resident chaperone PDI, the TBs have clear membrane continuity with the ER (Fig. 2E, Fig. 5E, Fig. S2D and F). Consequently, a very likely scenario is that the TBs are generated by excess E protein that self\u2010aggregates in the ER. The CMSs were negative for any of the tested viral proteins (Fig. S2G and H, Fig. S3D and F, Table 1), and therefore we speculate that they are induced by the S protein, for which we do not have an antibody compatible with our IEM procedure. The CMSs are clearly connected with ER and positive for PDI (2, 5). Interestingly, it has previously been shown that overexpression of transmembrane proteins that have the capacity to self\u2010interact can lead to the formation of geometrical and crystalloid conformations in the ER that have been called either \u2018cubic membranes\u2019 or \u2018organised smooth ER\u2019, which resemble the CMSs (Snapp et al., 2003; 2006, 2009). Therefore, the simplest model that we propose is that CMSs are formed by the self\u2010assembly of excess S protein in the ER.",

We decided to employ HeLa cells because many antibodies against human proteins are available and those cells have previously been successfully used for the study of CoV Replication (Gosert et al., 2002). The HeLa\u2010CEACAM1a cells were inoculated with MHV\u2010A59 at an moi of 30 Tissue Culture Infection Dose (TCID50) as determined on LR7 cells, in phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS) containing 50 \u00b5g ml\u22121 diethylaminoethyl\u2010dextran (PBS\u2010DEAE).
