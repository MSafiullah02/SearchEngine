Since it employs a diversity of building materials, nanomaterials can be employed to enhance the materials' performances, durability, longevity and sustainability. The construction and building practice is detrimental to the environment in various aspects such as electricity consumption, landfill accumulation, unhealthy aesthetics and neighborhoods. This chapter shows how nanotechnology-based building materials are playing an important role in green architectural design and construction, which has become a growing trend in many countries. Nanomaterials could be integrated with cement, concrete, or windows to conserve energy, minimize electricity bills and sanitize the surrounding atmosphere. Nevertheless, the industry is still facing many hurdles towards the wide application of nanomaterials in a cost effective manner.",

In addition, the construction industry is a rapidly growing industry. The nature of the construction industry involves the application and use of a diversity of building materials. This leads to nanotechnology being rapidly adopted by the construction market in several aspects like coatings, insulation materials, and building materials (steel, cement, asphalt, glass, polymers, etc.). Nanomaterials are currently employed in cements, steel, and even windows to render buildings greener, more cost effective and safer.",

These specifications aim at reducing CO 2 emissions and reducing the negative impact of the construction industry on the environment. Green architectural design and construction has shifted dramatically since the evolution of nanotechnology. Many people are now seeking healthy lifestyles and environmentally friendly neighborhoods. Green building is currently experiencing a growing demand by governments, architects, and people, especially after many cities have adopted strict regulations regarding green construction. Globally buildings consume around one third of the worldwide electricity [1] , with cement alone contributing to the global CO 2 emissions by around 5 % [2].",

For example, nanoreinforcements in steel have rendered steel stronger and lighter. Nanoreinforcements in cement have rendered it more durable and cost effective. Another application of nanotechnology in the market involves making Ultra Violet (UV) absorbing, self-cleaning, and depolluting coatings for windows. Moreover, nanotechnology has been rapidly adopted in air and water purification systems. The next generation of nanotechnology applications in construction has begun to involve Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV), which are solar cells that can be integrated within buildings in smart designs without affecting the buildings' aesthetics, as well as being a clean source of energy and electricity. Even electronics and sensors are being developed to be integrated with buildings. Smart curtains or windows are expected to change the way people are experiencing the way they live (imagine walls that change colors with just a click!) [1] .",

Nano-enhanced materials are more expensive than conventional materials. They yield high performances using small amounts of the materials. Thus, it is expected that with the continuous R&D (Research and Development) efforts to improve nanomaterials' performances at lower costs, the construction market will continue to increasingly adopt the nanomaterials. Proper education of the construction industry about the potential benefits associated with nanotechnology is the starting point towards the rapid adoption of nanotechnology in building materials. Although nano-based construction materials are not economically competitive compared to conventional materials, continuous efforts are undertaken to render them cost effective. In addition, strict regulations have proved to be an important surge to the adoption of nanotech in green construction. One significant example is the US LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Development) which has developed strict minimum standards to simultaneously force and encourage builders to conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions.",
