Using examples reported by US healthcare organizations including ours, we describe the role telehealth has played in transforming healthcare delivery during the three phases of the US COVID-19 pandemic: 1) Stay-at-Home Outpatient Care; 2) Initial COVID-19 Hospital Surge, and 3) Post-Pandemic Recovery. Within each of these three phases, we examine how people, process and technology work together to support a successful telehealth transformation.

While this crisis has presented the US healthcare delivery system unprecedented challenges, it has catalyzed rapid adoption of telehealth and transformed healthcare delivery at a breathtaking pace [1, 2] . The term \"telehealth\" refers to the entire spectrum of activities used to deliver care at a distance -without direct physical contact with the patient. Telehealth encompasses both provider-to-patient and provider-to-provider communications, and can take place synchronously (telephone and video), asynchronously (patient portal messages, E-Consults), and through virtual agents (chatbots) and wearable devices. A brief summary of the opportunities and limitations of each type of telehealth encounter is offered ( Table 1) . Telehealth programs overcome physical barriers to provide patients and caregivers access to convenient medical care. Healthcare systems with telehealth sustain the continuity of outpatient patient care during this pandemic in the midst of \"Stay at Home\" orders and physical distancing measures, while reducing community and nosocomial spread. Telehealth also proves useful for inpatient care, in particular to help balance the supply of clinical services with surge in demand across physical or geographical boundaries, conserve personal protective equipment and provide isolated patients connection to family and friends [3, 4] .",

To manage this shift, a centralized telehealth call center was created, staffed by newly hired and repurposed existing staff, medical students and \"superusers\" to train providers and patients to use telehealth systems. A \"train the trainer\" model allowed rapid staff development in order to onboard over 1,300 providers in 3 weeks, while providing technical online support during live patient visits. Using ExtendedCare (STA Group, LLC), we offered scheduled outpatient video visits integrated into our EHR's patient portal (Epic, Verona WI), so that patients could interact with their clinicians from either their personal computers or smartphones. Virtual patient waiting rooms, privacy/security and easy scheduling were important when evaluating a platform. Home peripheral devices were used with certain patients to facilitate remote visits. For example, blood pressure machines and cuffs were sent to high-risk obstetrics patients.",

Where COVID-19 differs from standard disaster management is the pathogenicity and virulence of the virus. As such, telehealth is ideally suited to meet the demands of inpatient care while at the same time reducing virus transmission, stretching human and technical resources, and protecting patients and healthcare workers in the inpatient care setting.",

As an example, at Duke, we created a virtual pulmonologist / intensivist service (Tele-ICU) that allows specialists to remotely manage intubated patients. Physicians are able to see the ventilator settings, patients' work of breathing, and remotely consult with the bedside team, while decreasing exposure risk and preserving PPEs (Figure 3) . Table 2 describes the considerations necessary for executing a Tele-ICU service, including key stakeholders, changes to process, and the technologies we employed. Additional considerations (e.g., equipment durability, infection prevention, data security, clinical usability) are also illustrated. The Tele-ICU approach is easily extended to the non-ICU setting, particularly for clinician-clinician communication and care of patients on isolation. As an added feature, our Tele-ICU approach allows medical trainees, who have been largely removed from clinical encounters because of COVID-19, to participate and support clinical staff, including inpatient rounds or outpatient experiences. Clinician and/or staff in other part of hospital or at home can assess patient virtually and assist in clinical care with bedside facilitator Pulmonary/Intensivist Ventilator Consults responded in-person or virtually as appropriate Cleaned after each use (Tru-D, Sani-Cloth wipes) In-service trainings, multiple educational/training sessions TECHNOLOGIES implemented for the new approach Video camera (1080p) with microphone and speaker (loud enough to hear at 10 feet) HIPAA-compliant, secure and easy to use video platform on desktop and mobile device (tablet, smartphone) Mounts, poles to allow to modify camera angle (towards patient, ventilator, vitals, family, etc.) Easily cleaned with protective/durable cases Specific hospital computers for consultants with cameras/mics and video platform installed Entire system available within 5-7 days delivery Strict visitor restrictions implemented by most hospitals can also cause patients to feel socially isolated.",

There may also be a reemergence of COVID-19 cases after movement restrictions are lifted. A growing \"care debt\" or deferred medical or surgical treatment may lead to increasing demand on a constrained healthcare system. This may include COVID-19 patients as well as those with other forms of acute and chronic diseases. For example, during the COVID pandemic, emergency departments are reporting a decrease in visits, and unpublished reports describe a dramatic decrease of 40-70% in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial elevation cases [16] . Deferral of care for serious conditions can cause downstream consequences, such as complications of unmanaged conditions including acute coronary syndromes, causing a surge in demand for care unrelated to COVID-19 infections. Cancelled elective surgical cases and treatments during the pandemic can add to this \"care debt\" that both patients and health systems may face. Along with the economic uncertainty of many healthcare organizations, further constraints to care capacity may be present during the post-pandemic recovery phase.",

The most straightforward approach is to extend and operationalize the changes to people, processes, and technologies explored in the first 2 phases, anticipating a sustained higher level of telehealth services. Of note, this will require the re-evaluation of regulation and policies and reimbursement models across multiple stakeholders including local healthcare organizations, state medical board, federal government, and payers. Both payers and healthcare professionals will need to re-examine their historical insistence on face-to-face patientprovider interactions where laying of hands is considered a sacrosanct component of care. While geographic and site restrictions for Medicare reimbursement have largely been waived with the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2020 [17] , compensation models for different telehealth services will need to be actively updated by payers, including the federal government. In addition, the clinical outcomes of different types of visits (in-person, video and telephone) must be examined to prevent potential perverse incentives leading to unnecessary increased video over potentially also effective telephone encounter caused by differential visit reimbursement.",
