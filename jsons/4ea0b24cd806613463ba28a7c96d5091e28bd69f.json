We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in our patient's feces, and the endoscopic findings of coloproctopathy in her descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum confirmed colonic injury and pointed toward an infectious process. We were also able to eliminate, to the greatest extent possible, other potential etiologies of hemorrhagic colitis-such as alternative infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and ischemic colitis-through laboratory testing, radiological imaging, and colon and rectal biopsies. Although fecal molecular testing was performed after the initiation of antimicrobials, it is well described that even in the treated patient, fecal molecular testing will remain positive for up to several weeks (11) .

It is certainly plausible that this applied to our patient. Our patient did clinically improve with hydroxychloroquine administration, and there have been some reports suggesting a possible benefit (19, 20) . We are unsure whether this was truly a therapeutic effect or coincidental. More research is certainly needed regarding the clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

However, live SARS-CoV-2 virus has also been isolated from fecal samples and viral particles have been detected in the feces even after resolution of respiratory symptoms, suggesting the potential for fecal-oral transmission beyond the symptomatic period (8, 21) . When our patient was admitted, she did not meet the CDC guidelines at the time for persons under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 infection because she was afebrile, had no respiratory symptoms, and had not travelled to China, Italy, Iran, or South Korea. We were unfortunately not aware of the Washington Post article that ran 3 days before her presentation, reporting a cluster of SARS-CoV-2 cases associated with Nile River cruises (22) . Awareness of the gastrointestinal manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 may have increased our index of suspicion and encouraged us to institute SARS-CoV-2 precautions on arrival, avoiding the exposure and subsequent quarantine of 72 healthcare workers, including many of us.",

On this basis, we believe it is important to institute SARS-CoV-2 precautions in patients who present with either respiratory or digestive symptoms. We also encourage the rapid development and deployment of fecal testing kits for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and encourage institutions to use their nasopharyngeal kits for fecal testing in the interim.",
