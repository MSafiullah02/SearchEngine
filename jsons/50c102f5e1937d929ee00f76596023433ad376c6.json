            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease that began in Guandong, China in November 2002, and has caused serious infection in Asia, Europe and Canada. 1 -5 The SARS coronavirus (CoV), which is a pathogenic virus of SARS, is a single-strand RNA virus. It is known that this virus infects animals other than humans. 6 -8 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mortality for patients afflicted with SARS is about 15% on average, and can be 50% or higher in the case of patients aged 65 and over. 9 SARS-CoV is an enveloped and positively single-stranded RNA virus with a typical genome size 29.7 kb, encoding a RNA directed RNA polymerase and structural proteins including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. 10 -12 The N protein is a 422-amino-acid alkaline protein with a short lysine-rich region suggested to be the nuclear localization signal. It plays an important role in the process of virus particle assembly by enveloping the entire genomic RNA. 13 The nucleocapsid (N) protein of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an important antigen for the early diagnosis of SARS and the detection of diseases. 14 Since SARS broke out in 2003, researchers have made great efforts in the development of fast and accurate analytical methods for its early diagnosis. 15 -19 The Nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV is a major pathological determinant in the host that may cause host cell apoptosis, up-regulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and block innate immune responses. Therefore, SARS-CoV N protein has long been thought an ideal target for the detection of SARS. The monitoring of SARS-CoV N protein has been of considerable interest in the development of simple and reliable methods for the detection of SARS for applications in diagnostic medicine. At present, the most widely used method of diagnosing SARS is the detection of anti-SARS antibodies using a screening enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), based on recombinant proteins from the genome of SARS. 18, 19 Although it is highly specific, this assay has limitations. For example, it cannot detect viruses during the early stage of an infection, at a time when antibodies against SARS antigens are not produced. In addition, the ELISA method sometimes generates false-positive or false-negative results. In addition, using antibodies creates problem such as being temperature-sensitive, specific reactions conditions and requiring secondary antibody conjugated with enzyme and fluorescent dyes.",

In particular, Aptamers exhibit advantages as recognition elements in biosensing when compared with antibodies and enzymes, thus making it possible to develop a wide range of aptamer-based biosensors. Chemically stable and cost-effective aptamers offer great flexibility in the design of novel biosensors with high detection sensitivity and selectivity. 20 -24 Quantum dots (QDs), which are colloidal nanoparticles of semiconductor materials, have attracted much attention in the fields of nanotechnology and biotechnology, especially in biological imaging applications because of their remarkable optical characteristics compared with conventional organic fluorophores in terms of being bright, tunable and having narrow fluorescence emission, and broad absorption spectra. 25 -27 In this study, it was established that optical QDs-conjugated aptamer could be used as a probe for the detection of SARS-CoV N protein using a chip system. Using an optical QDs-based RNA aptamer chip, we could detect the SARS-CoV N protein at concentrations as low as 0.1 pg mL \u22121 . A biosensor assay for SARS-CoV N protein detection based on an optical QDs-based aptamer has attracted significant attention. It is a promising method for the specific detection of oligonucleotide because of its high sensitivity, low cost, rapid response, compatibility for miniaturization and low labor requirements. ",

The SARS-CoV N protein was purified by a single chromatography step on a Ni 2+ affinity column. The C-terminally his-tagged SARS-CoV N protein was visualized with a molecular mass of approximately 48 kDa on a SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 3(A) ). Figure 3 (B) shows the sequence and secondary structure of RNA aptamer that binds to SARS-CoV N protein. The RNA secondary structure of the used aptamer was analyzed using the Mfold program. 32 We demonstrated the specific interaction between QDsconjugated RNA aptamer and immobilized SARS-CoV N protein on a chip. Preferential binding of QDs-conjugated RNA aptamer for the detection of SARS-CoV N protein was determined by analyzing the fluorescence intensity measured by confocal microscopy. As illustrated in Fig. 4(B) , the QDs-supported RNA aptamer conjugates showed high fluorescence signals on the chip. No fluorescence signal was detected with BSA protein, due to its lack of affinity ( Fig. 4(A) ). The signal of QDs-conjugated RNA oligonucleotide for BSA protein binding affinity was very similar to the background signal. RNA aptamer could be detected even at the lowest concentration (0.1 pg mL \u22121 ). The signal intensity was found to increase gradually by up to 0.1 pg mL \u22121 of SARS-CoV N protein concentration. These results suggest the QDs-conjugated RNA aptamer could specifically target the SARS-CoV N protein on an immobilized chip. The detection limit was improved at least 10-fold compared with the aptamer-based chemiluminescence immunosorbent assay. 28 Furthermore, this system may be useful for rapid detection of SARS-CoV N protein within 1 h. These results suggest that the QDs-conjugated RNA oligonucleotide could be effective for the quantification of SARS-CoV N protein. The immobilized BSA protein chip showed no binding to RNA aptamer, thus demonstrating selectivity for SARS-CoV N protein. The remarkable imaging by semiconductor nanocrystals QDs allows for monitoring with the intense light emission and accuracy. In summary, we showed that QDs-conjugated RNA oligonucleotide can specifically recognize the SARS-CoV N protein. We demonstrated that this QDs-conjugated RNA aptamer could interact on a designed chip specifically and sensitively. This device could form a QDs-conjugated biosensor prototype chip for SARS-CoV N protein diagnosis. The proposed visual SARS-CoV N protein detection technique may avoid the limitations of other reported methods because of its high sensitivity, good specificity, simplicity, and speed.",

Thus, it could be developed as a sensitive diagnostic tool. Furthermore, this QDs-conjugated aptamer chip might have application potential as a simple and rapid diagnosis tool. This technique has potential applications in many fields, especially in multiple diseases detection.",
