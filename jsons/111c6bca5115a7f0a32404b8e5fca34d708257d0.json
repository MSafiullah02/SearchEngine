In Singapore and Hong Kong, rapid and strict quarantine rules and contact tracing have helped to \"flatten the curve\". In South Korea, mass testing and quarantine measures appear to have reduced the rate of new cases. However, Japan has not engaged in expansive testing, contact tracing, or strict quarantine measures and yet is reporting a slow growth rate of infected persons and a death rate that is currently just 1/10 th of world average. It is difficult to make direct comparison of infection rates, because the number of tests per capita varies dramatically between countries. However, this low death rate cannot be simply explained by lack of testing or reporting, as no surge in death from respiratory syndromes has been reported either.",

In addition, many Japanese wear cloth or paper face masks (not the N95 respirators required for exclusion of aerosol viral particles) in the winter to avoid transmission of respiratory infections. People use the mask to avoid spreading the infection and also in an attempt to prevent exposure to infection. However, we are unconvinced that this is the main or only reason why COVID-19 is so well contained in Japan. There is no social distancing in rush hour trains and buses, or when walking in crowded streets to school or to work. The use of face mask is also practiced in other Asian countries that witnessed higher rates of infection. A hint to whether this is a valid hypothesis comes from looking at other pandemic viral respiratory diseases. The community R 0 rate for the 2009 pandemic flu for Japan was 1.28 while USA was 1.7-2.0 (Boelle et al, 2011) . Thus, R 0 in Japan was somewhat lower than the global median R 0 of 1.47. In addition, an observational study of elementary school children in Japan found that wearing masks had significant protective association (odds ratio of 0.859, 95% confidence interval 0.778-0.949) against seasonal influenza (Uchida et al, 2017) . Therefore, the social practice culture of Japan and mask use may explain to some extent the lower number of observed COVID-19 cases, but is unlikely the only explanation.",

Furthermore, all of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes are highly similar; most contain no more than 10 mutations compared to the virus that started the original outbreak. Thus, it is highly unlikely that the virus has evolved a significantly different phenotype, and even less likely that it was introduced early into Japan.",

Michai Netea and colleagues hypothesized that the vaccine may boost \"trained immunity\" (Netea et al, 2016) -in other words, certain immune stimuli may induce a prolonged state of resistance against pathogens in general, by elevating the expression levels of resistance factors. Studies have shown that receipt of BCG vaccine was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality within the first 1-60 months: The average relative risks were 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.49-1.01) from five clinical trials (Higgins et al, 2016) . Furthermore, Netea and colleagues showed that BCG vaccination reduced the levels of viremia caused by the yellow fever virus live attenuated vaccine (Arts et al, 2018) , and post-BCG increase of IL-1b production strongly correlated with lower viremia after yellow fever virus administration. A placebocontrolled randomized clinical trial of 1,000 healthcare workers in The Netherlands has started, and a similar trial is planned to begin at the Max Planck Institute (de Vrieze, 2020). The outcomes of these trials will help us to understand whether and how BCG confers resistance to other pathogens including SARS-CoV-2.",

Many of these hypotheses can be tested as suggested above, such as examining ACE2 expression levels in the respiratory tract, GWAS data on COVID-19 susceptibility, and whether BCG vaccines indeed confer long-term innate immune resistance to SARS-CoV-2. The three-pronged approach by the Cluster Response Team of the Japanese Ministry of Health has thus far contained the spread of COVID-19 by quickly identifying clusters of infections, testing, and quarantine of the infected individuals. A word of caution is whether this approach will work in cases where super-spreaders ignite a large-scale transmission, or when there are multiple clusters that occur throughout the country at once. Perhaps one of the reasons for the low number of cases in Japan might relate to lack of super-spreader events to date. Just within the last 24 h, Japan has declared the state of emergency, as Tokyo faces more than 1,000 confirmed cases, more than double the number a week ago. Perhaps stronger social distancing measures are required to keep the curve flattened in Japan.",
