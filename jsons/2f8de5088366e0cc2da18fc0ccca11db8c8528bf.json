One feature that can change spreading dynamics substantially is heterogeneous behavior among different types of individuals in a social network. In this paper, we explore how antiestablishment nodes (e.g., hipsters) influence the spreading dynamics of two competing products. We consider a model in which spreading follows a deterministic rule for updating node states (which indicate which product has been adopted) in which an adjustable probability p Hip of the nodes in a network are hipsters, who choose to adopt the product that they believe is the less popular of the two. The remaining nodes are conformists, who choose which product to adopt by considering which products their immediate neighbors have adopted. We simulate our model on both synthetic and real networks, and we show that the hipsters have a major effect on the final fraction of people who adopt each product: even when only one of the two products exists at the beginning of the simulations, a small fraction of hipsters in a network can still cause the other product to eventually become the more popular one. To account for this behavior, we construct an approximation for the steady-state adoption fractions of the products on k-regular trees in the limit of few hipsters. Additionally, our simulations demonstrate that a time delay \u03c4 in the knowledge of the product distribution in a population, as compared to immediate knowledge of product adoption among nearest neighbors, can have a large effect on the final distribution of product adoptions. Using a local-tree approximation, we derive an analytical estimate of the spreading of products and obtain good agreement if a sufficiently small fraction of the population consists of hipsters. In all networks, we find that either of the two products can become the more popular one at steady state, depending on the fraction of hipsters in the network and on the amount of delay in the knowledge of the product distribution. Our simple model and analysis may help shed light on the road to success for antiestablishment choices in elections, as such success-and qualitative differences in final outcomes between competing products, political candidates, and so on-can arise rather generically in our model from a small number of antiestablishment individuals and ordinary processes of social influence on normal individuals.",

In analogy with the spread of infectious diseases in populations of susceptible individuals, the spread of social phenomena (such as opinions, actions, memes, information, misinformation, and alternative facts) is often viewed as a contagion process that spreads through a network's nodes, which are connected to each other via one or more types of edges. The nodes can represent entities such as people or institutions [19] [20] [21] (or other things); and the edges can represent physical proximity, communication chan-* jonas.juul@nbi.ku.dk \u2020 mason@math.ucla.edu nels, sociological interactions (e.g., different types of relationships), or something else. An important goal of many studies of the spread of social contagions is the identification of criteria that determine when the phenomenon that is spreading reaches a large fraction of a population or subpopulation [1, 2] .",

            "text": "Scholars have used various approaches for studying contagions on networks. These include game theory [7] , statistical physics [10] , agent-based models [22] , and systems of coupled differential equations or stochastic processes [2, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . The temporal dynamics and peak size of an outbreak are influenced both by the specific model of a contagion and by the structure of the network on which it spreads [12, 20, 25, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . A key idea is to examine when a disease or idea-perhaps one that initially is present in a small fraction of nodes-can become widespread in a network. When a large fraction of a population or subpopulation becomes infected (or adopts an idea), one says that a cascade has occurred. Cascading phenomena have been studied in a wide variety of systems, ranging from financial networks [21] to social media like Twitter [35] . For example, a failing financial institution can cause a cascade of failures of numerous other financial institutions, a tweet can result in a cascade of tweets that promotes the opinion of the original tweeter (perhaps influenced by the actions of \"bot\" or sockpuppet accounts [17] ), and widely spread alternative facts can influence the opinions of a large population of voters [36] . Notwithstanding these dystopian examples, cascading behavior can be beneficial, neutral, or harmful.",

One example of models that traditionally have deterministic update rules is threshold models for social contagions. The simplest example is the Watts threshold model (WTM) [5, 6, 9] , a type of bootstrap percolation [37] , in which each node is assigned a threshold from some distribution. When considering a node for updating, if the fraction of its neighbors that are adopters is at least as large as its threshold, it too becomes an adopter. There are numerous variants and generalizations of the WTM, including ones with adoption thresholds that are based on the number (rather than the fraction) of neighbors who are adopters [12, 38] , ones with multiple adoption stages [25] , ones with \"synergy\" from other nearby adopters [27] , and ones with timers in addition to adoption thresholds [39] .",

Rogers [40] gave a qualitative description (as a sigmoidal shape) of the number of adopters as a function of time. Bass [41] developed a model for the adoption of innovations that was inspired by models for biological contagions. Bass's model results in sigmoidal-shaped adoption curves, and it has been generalized in various ways [42] [43] [44] [45] . More recent studies have considered models in which agents of different types can have significant effects on the final distributions of products or innovations in a population. For example, Gordon et al. [46] showed that temporal cycles of adoption can occur if some nodes are allowed to regret adopting an innovation while other (\"contrarian\") nodes resist adopting innovations. References [47, 48] found rich behavior (including chaotic dynamics) in a social contagion model that incorporates an aversion to complete conformity.",

Galam and collaborators have also examined the effects of contrarian [50] and stubborn [51, 52] agents on opinion dynamics (though typically without any network structure). Nyczka et al. [53] and Nyczka and Sznajd-Weron [54] studied various opinion models (e.g., q-voter models) on a complete graph to highlight an important distinction between two types of nonconformity-anticonformity and independence-that have distinct implications for social dynamics.

More recent work related to contrarian agents, in addition to [46] [47] [48] , includes that of Mellor et al.

In some cases, such as the 2016 \"Brexit\" vote [65] and the 2016 American presidential election [66] , antiestablishment opinions appear to have spread to so many people that they exerted a major influence on political outcomes. In this paper, we ask the following questions: (1) How does a large fraction of a population decide to choose something different from the established standard? (2) How can a small fraction of individuals spread their antiestablishment opinions to a majority (or at least to a very large minority) of the rest of a population? (3) Can we capture these ideas using a simple mathematical model of a spreading process on a network?",

This study observed that the dynamics of a population was influenced greatly by delays in the knowledge of hipsters and by how FIG. 1. Illustration of our model of a threshold-based social contagion with hipsters. A node is a hipster with probability p Hip , and it is a conformist with probability 1 \u2212 p Hip . If at least a fraction \u03c6 i of the neighbors of node i are active (as indicated by the red coloring) at discrete time step t \u2212 1, the node activates and adopts a product at time step t (for t 1). We then need to consider which products have been adopted by node i's neighbors and the relative popularity of different products in the whole network. If node i is a conformist, it adopts the product that is more popular among its active neighbors at time t \u2212 1. However, if node i is a hipster, it adopts the product that is less popular among the active nodes in the network at time step t \u2212 \u03c4 (where \u03c4 \u2208 N). For both node types, a tie results in a node choosing one of the two products (blue versus purple) with equal probability. large a fraction of the population are hipsters. In the model in [67] , individuals interact with their environments and switch between two states with a probability that depends on this environment and on whether an individual is a conformist (preferring to be aligned with its environment) or a hipster (preferring to be opposite to its environment). The model has a phase transition that determines whether or not hipsters ultimately attain the same state. Touboul [67] referred to the anticonformists with delayed knowledge as \"hipsters.\" Because the model that we introduce in this study includes anticonformists with delayed knowledge of the global product distribution, we adopt this terminology. However, our approach, focus, and type of model-which builds on threshold models for social contagions-are rather different from those in [67] .",

Conformists prefer to adopt the product (or meme, opinion, message, etc.) that is more popular among their active neighbors at time t \u2212 1. Hipsters, however, prefer to adopt the product that is the less popular of the two products in the whole network at some previous time t \u2212 \u03c4 . Their choice to adopt a product uses the same adoption condition as that of the conformists. This is a strong assumption, and we make it partly for simplicity (as it allows us to build from the WTM) and partly because it reflects a scenario in which an anticonformist may more actively rebel on an issue that is sufficiently established in its neighborhood in a network. In our model, both conformists and hipsters first choose to buy some product or form an opinion, and then they choose which one to adopt. In their study of the effect of luddites, Mellor et al. [58] assumed that the probability of a node becoming a luddite is proportional to the rate of change in the density of adopters of its neighbors. This resembles our choice that a node's neighborhood influences whether or not it elects to adopt a product, but it differs from our choice that each of our nodes is either inherently a conformist or inherently a hipster. The delay \u03c4 in our model encodes the fact that knowledge about the total population is not instantly available; instead, it is collected over some time before it is available. See Gleeson et al. [68] for a model (without network structure) that illustrates another type of competition between local information (in the form of a social-media feed) and global information (in the form of a bestseller list).",

To set up a simple example of a threshold model, consider a network with N nodes, and suppose that each node i has an independently assigned threshold \u03c6 i that we draw from a distribution f (\u03c6). We also suppose that a node can be in one of two states: active or inactive. An active node has adopted a product (or meme, opinion, etc.) that is spreading in a population, and an inactive node has not adopted the product. (We will use the term \"product\" from now on.) Once a node becomes active, it stays active forever. The threshold of a node determines how difficult it is to activate that node, so one can construe a node's threshold value as its stubbornness level. Node i becomes active if a peer pressure, which in the WTM is equal to the fraction of active nodes among i's neighbors, is greater than or equal to its threshold \u03c6 i .",

This is also appropriate for exploring the competition between local and global forms of influence. We examine our hipster model both on synthetic networks and on empirical social networks. Our main goal is to examine whether (and when) a small probability p Hip of hipster nodes can lead to a majority of a network's nodes adopting a product that is less popular than another product at the beginning of a spreading process.

One interesting result is that the fractions that adopt products A and B are very similar for \u03c4 = 2 [see On 3-regular configuration-model networks with \u03c4 2, we observe that \u03c1 B,tot (t \u2192 \u221e) first becomes larger than \u03c1 A,tot (t \u2192 \u221e) at about p Hip \u2248 0.06, which is lower than the hipster probability that we observed for the analogous result for 5-regular configuration-model networks. As we show in Fig. 5 , this transition sometimes changes with seed size, depending on the value of the delay \u03c4 . For \u03c4 = 2, the transition occurs at the same probability when we seed more nodes with product A; however, for the larger delay value \u03c4 = 6, the transition moves towards larger probabilities for progressively larger sets of seed nodes who adopt product A. When the seed size is 1, we observe in Fig. 4 that the height of the first peak is lower when we simulate our model on 3-regular configuration-model networks than was the case for 5-regular configuration-model networks. For large p Hip , the more-popular product at steady state is the same for \u03c4 = {3, 4} [see Figs. 4(c) and 4(d)] as it is for the same delay times on the 5-regular configuration-model networks, while it is opposite to that on the 5-regular configuration-model networks for \u03c4 = {5, 6} [see Figs. 4(e) and 4(f)].

One possibility, which we suggested in our discussion of 3-regular configuration-model networks in Sec. V B, is whether our analytical approximation is running into problems because we are considering networks that are not locally treelike (although similar approximations are known to be effective for many networks that are not locally treelike [71] ). Additionally, note that the mean local clustering coefficient for our ER networks with z = 5 is 0.00058 \u00b1 0.00018, so our networks have very few 3-cycles. If we ignore which product is adopted and pretend that the two products are the same, we recover the usual WTM model; the present paper uses an analytical approximation that is known to work in that situation [31] . Our own recent work has demonstrated that this type of analytical approximation is also effective for a WTM augmented with \"synergistic\" social influence from nodes other than nearest neighbors [27] , so the incorporation of different types of nodes (rather than the lack of a locally treelike network structure) appears to be the likely cause of the breakdown of the approximation, especially given that our approximation becomes worse as we increase the hipster probability p Hip .",

Each node is adjacent to its immediate neighbors, with 2 neighbors each, except for nodes 0 and N \u2212 1 (which each have degree 1). For the sake of the argument, we assume that all nodes are vulnerable and that there is no delay in information (so that \u03c4 = 1). We also suppose that node 0 is the only seed, so it has adopted product A at time t = 0 [see Fig. 8(a) ]. If there are no hipsters in the line, all nodes in this scenario eventually adopt product A. If, by contrast, a single node i is a hipster, then all nodes j i eventually adopt product B. Therefore, if each node has the same independent probability of being a hipster, the expected steady-state fraction of product-B adopters approaches 1/2 as N \u2192 \u221e. In this case, the presence of a single hipster node increases the expected steady-state fraction of nodes that adopt product B from 0 nodes to half of the nodes. The main idea is that early adopters can influence later adopters in a way that depends on the adoption paths that are available [39] . Moreover, although the expected steady-state fraction of product-B adopters is 1/2, a single simulation of the model is equally likely to result in any number of product-B adopters, because each node is equally likely to be the hipster. This may be a reason why we observe large standard deviations in different realizations of our model on the various types of networks. For more complicated network topologies, although it is no longer true in general that different steady-state fractions of product-B adopters are equally probable, the steady-state adoption fraction in a given simulation depends significantly on where hipsters are located in a network.",

To illuminate the impact of \u03c4 , it is helpful to consider the following situation. Suppose that, because of hipsters, product B becomes more popular than product A at some point during a simulation of our model. A delay of \u03c4 2 postpones this time, at which hipsters start adopting product A rather than product B, so we expect hipsters who adopt product A to have fewer descendants than if \u03c4 = 1. This provides an argument for why the height of the peak of the fraction of product-B adopters as a function of p Hip increases with the delay, and it sheds some light on the effects of the delay. If there is no delay (i.e., \u03c4 = 1) and there are many hipsters, then hipsters tend to balance the popularities of the two products, leading to roughly equal fractions of the two products at steady state (as we saw in our simulations on all networks in Sec. V). FIG. 9 . Fraction of nodes in k-regular trees with L levels that are adopters of product B at steady state.

            "text": "Our analysis also improves our understanding of how various changes to our hipster model can affect steady-state results. For example, suppose that we use a stochastic updating rule instead of a deterministic one. Although the above analysis does not rely on the deterministic nature of our updating rule, it does indicate that adoption order is important, and anything that changes the adoption order (such as using a stochastic update rule or updating node states asynchronously instead of synchronously) may change the outcome of simulations [77] . However, from our analysis, we do expect some features of our results to be robust even with different update rules and update orders. For example, for either stochastic update rules or asynchronous updating, we expect an increase in the number of steady-state product-B adopters with increasing p Hip for small values of p Hip , followed by a decrease (or stall) in the number of steady-state product-B adopters when enough hipsters are present in a network (as some of them will now adopt product A). However, the rate at which the steadystate fraction of product-B adopters increases with p Hip for small p Hip is likely to be influenced by stochastic update rules and asynchronous updating. For instance, suppose that we use the same rules for product selection but that we employ an asynchronous updating process in which, during each time step, we select a node uniformly at random to update; we repeat this selection process some number of times during the same time step; and we then advance time by one step. We then continue with this process in our simulations until no further spreading occurs. In this case, every node in a network can potentially adopt a product even in the first time step, and the process tends to spread at a different rate-it can be either faster or slower-than in synchronous updating. Because the hipsters are distributed uniformly at random and the rules governing product choice are the same as in our original model, changing the number of adopters during each time step can directly affect hipsters, as their product choice is time-dependent. (Other nodes are affected indirectly, as they can experience a different product distribution in their neighborhoods.) Consequently, a faster initial spreading would increase early product-B adoption for a delay \u03c4 2, as all hipsters are guaranteed to choose product B for time steps t \u03c4 . To test this, we simulate the spreading of products on 5-regular configuration-model networks with \u03c4 = 2 and a single product-A adopter as a seed. We use the asynchronous updating procedure that we just described above. Averaging our results over 100 realizations [which we determine as in Fig. 3(b) ], we find that the steady-state product-B adoption fraction increases faster as we increase p Hip for small values of p Hip than what was the case for synchronous updating [see Fig. 3(b) ]. As we expected, we also find that the product-B steady-state adoption fraction decreases as we increase p Hip for larger values of p Hip . More generally, different update mechanisms and update orders can yield different dissemination trees, which describe how a contagion spreads through a network [39] . This can, in turn, impact steady-state product popularities.",

For example, with a threshold distribution in which all nodes are vulnerable, a spreading process can reach a steady state very quickly, and there are then few hierarchical levels in the associated dissemination tree. By contrast, a threshold distribution for which a network starts with fewer vulnerable nodes may take longer to reach a steady state, and one thus expects more levels in an associated dissemination tree. From our analysis, we see that this in turn can increase the steady-state adoption fraction of product B for small values of p Hip . Performing simulations on 5-regular configuration model networks with \u03c4 = 2 [as in Fig. 3(b) ] and 150 seed nodes with probabilities p 0 = 1.00, p 0 = 0.90, and p 0 = 0.80 supports this intuition.

To illustrate this point, we again consider line networks and k-regular trees. For a line network with a single hipster and a seed node that adopts product A at one end, the expected steady-state fraction of product-B adopters is roughly 1/2 for a line with any number of nodes. However, adding another level to a k-regular tree with a single seed node that adopts product A affects the expected steadystate fraction of product-B adopters. For example, a 3-regular tree with 3 levels (and hence with 10 nodes in total) has an expected steady-state fraction\u03c1 B = 15/100 of product-B adopters, whereas a 3-regular tree with 4 levels (and hence with 22 nodes in total) has\u03c1 B = 1/10. This difference occurs because adding another level to the 3-regular tree increases the fraction of nodes that are leaves. Therefore, the randomly distributed hipsters have fewer descendants on average in a dissemination tree, decreasing the expected fraction of product-B adopters at steady state. In simulations on regular configuration-model networks with 10 3 nodes (using several values of \u03c4 for 3-regular networks and \u03c4 = 3 for 5-regular ones) for small values of p Hip , we observe the same fast increase in steady-state product-B adopters as we increase p Hip that we observed previously for these networks with 10 4 nodes (see, e.g., Fig. 4) . However, for large values of p Hip , the steady-state product-B adopter fraction can differ substantially in simulations on networks with 10 3 nodes and 10 4 nodes. More generally, our analysis demonstrates that the number of nodes in a network can affect steady-state product distributions. Even taking seed-size scaling into consideration (see [70] ), dissemination trees can still change, potentially affecting qualitative steady-state results.",

For example, consider a modification of our model in which a hipster that becomes active at time step t adopts the product that is less popular among its neighbors at time t \u2212 \u03c4 . Furthermore, suppose that two competing products are spreading in a k-regular tree in which the central node is the only seed. As usual, the seed has adopted product A. When we constructed our approximation (7) for the steady-state distribution of products in the limit of few hipsters, we assumed that every hipster adopts product B. In the modified hipster model in our current discussion, this approximation may be very bad. Hipsters who descend from other hipsters may adopt product A. We thus expect the product-B steady-state adoption fraction to increase more slowly with p Hip for small p Hip if a hipster adopts the product that is less popular among its neighbors, rather than the less-popular product among all active nodes in a network.

We examined our hipster threshold model on various types of networks, and we considered different probabilities of the hipster nodes and different amounts of time delay in the global information that the hipsters possess. In the absence of a time delay, we found that hipsters tend to balance the adoption of the two competing products. For all other delay values and all examined types of networks, we observed that the steady-state fraction of nodes that adopt product B (i.e., the product that would not be adopted in the absence of hipsters) grows rapidly with the probability of hipsters. Surprisingly, for all of our networks, we needed only a small probability of hipsters to observe many situations in which product B is comparably popular, or even more popular, than product A at steady state. In our simulations on a variety of synthetic networks, we found that it is often sufficient for fewer than 10% of the nodes to be hipsters for product B to become at least as widespread as product A (the only product that has any adopters at time t = 0).

On these networks, we obtained good agreement between simulations and an approximation of the steady-state fraction of nodes that adopt product B in the limit of few hipsters. From our analytical approximation in the few-hipster regime, we observed that the steady-state product-B adoption fraction increases with the distance between the seed node and other nodes. This gives some insight into why there is a much slower increase in product-B adopters for the spreading process on the Facebook network than in the examined synthetic networks, as the former has a smaller mean geodesic (i.e., shortest) path length than our synthetic networks. It also suggests that different realizations with identical parameter values may result in very different steady-state adoption fractions, given that we use random processes to choose hipsters and seed nodes. One consequence of such sensitivity to initial conditions is large standard deviations in the mean steady-state adoption fraction of each product, which is what we observed in most cases. The same mechanistic insight suggests that a larger delay \u03c4 results in more hipsters adopting product B early in a simulation, and each of these early adopters influences the product choice of later adopters. We believe that postponing the time at which hipsters choose product A instead of product B is the main reason that a progressively larger delay \u03c4 results in a progressively larger peak of the expected product-B adoption fraction as a function p Hip . Finally, the mechanistic insight from our approximation in the few-hipster limit also helps illustrate that the properties-such as threshold distributions, the number of nodes in a network, and update rules-of an update rule or network that affect dissemination trees (which describe how a contagion spreads through a network) can affect observations at steady state, although some qualitative observations should be robust under such variations. Our hipster threshold model exhibits a variety of fascinating dynamics on different types of networks. For example, when there is a delay in global information (i.e., \u03c4 2) and the hipster probability p Hip is large, we observed nontrivial characteristics in the number of intervals of hipster probabilities for which a given product is more popular at steady state. The quality of the match between our pair approximation and numerical simulations also depends both on network structure and on the hipster probability. For example, our approximation was effective for small values of p Hip , and it correctly produced a fast increase in product-B adopters with increasing values of small p Hip ; it did reasonably well for large values of p Hip for 5-regular configuration-model networks (except for abrupt jumps that are not present in the simulations); it achieved mixed results for 3-regular configuration-model networks (although it yielded the correct result for the morepopular product at steady state for p Hip \u2248 1 in all but one instance); and it was ineffective for Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi networks (where it was incorrect about which product is more popular at steady state for p Hip \u2248 1 in roughly half of the cases).",

In our model, the hipsters always choose to adopt the product that is less popular at time step t \u2212 \u03c4 .

For each value of \u03c4 , we consider hipster probabilities p Hip \u2208 [0, 1] in increments of 0.01. For each (\u03c4, p Hip ) parameter pair, we simulate the model on 200 different networks and initial conditions. Each node has a threshold of \u03c6 = 0.2. For each simulation, we activate a single node, chosen uniformly at random, with product A at time t = 0. We stop each simulation when product adoptions are no longer occurring. We plot the mean steady-state fraction of nodes that adopt products A and B in the 200 realizations and the corresponding standard deviations of the means. [For each (\u03c4, p Hip ) parameter pair, we independently construct 200 networks, and we also independently determine the initial condition for each network.] For all values of \u03c4 , the fraction of nodes that adopt product B increases rapidly with p Hip for small p Hip , reaching 0.5 at p Hip \u2248 0.07. For \u03c4 = 1, which we show in panel (a), hipsters have information about the product distribution in the network without any delay, and the steady-state fractions of nodes that adopt products A and B are almost indistinguishable for p Hip 0.07. For larger values of \u03c4 [see panels (b)-(f)], the steady-state fraction of nodes that adopt each product varies for p Hip 0.07. For all \u03c4 3 [see panels (c)-(f)] the fraction of nodes that adopt product B is largest for a small interval of p Hip around p Hip \u2248 0.10. For \u03c4 4 [see panels (d)-(f)], we observe an additional, large-p Hip interval in which a majority of the nodes adopt product B. We also plot our analytically estimated fractions of product adoption from Eq. (1). Our analytical curves and numerical simulations match well for small values of p Hip . For larger hipster probabilities, however, our analytical approximation is not accurate. For \u03c4 = 5 [see panel (e)], it predicts incorrectly that product A is the more-popular product at steady state for large values of p Hip . Our analytical results also include jumps in the steady-state adoption fractions of products that are not present in our numerical simulations. 022313-11 FIG. 7. Distribution of products at steady state for the NORTHWESTERN25 network from the FACEBOOK100 data set. The different panels give results of simulations of our hipster threshold model with different delay times \u03c4 for the hipster nodes. For each value of \u03c4 , we consider hipster probabilities p Hip \u2208 [0, 1] in increments of 0.01. For each (\u03c4, p Hip ) parameter pair, we simulate the hipster threshold model on the NORTHWESTERN25 network with 200 choices for the seed node, chosen uniformly at random, which adopts product A at t = 0. We use a different set of 200 nodes for different parameter values. Each node has a threshold of \u03c6 = 1/33. We plot the mean fractions of nodes that are adopters of products A and B at steady state in the 200 realizations and the corresponding standard deviations of the means. For all values of \u03c4 , the steady-state fraction of nodes that adopt product B increases rapidly with p Hip for small p Hip , reaching 0.5 at p Hip \u2248 0.2 for \u03c4 3 [see panels (c)-(f)] and for larger values of p Hip for \u03c4 2 [see panels (a) and (b)]. For \u03c4 = 1, which we show in panel (a), hipsters have information about the product distribution in the network without any delay, and the steady-state fractions of nodes that adopt products A and B are very similar for p Hip 0.3. For larger values of \u03c4 [see panels (b)-(f)], the fraction of nodes that adopt each product varies nonmonotonically for p Hip 0.2. For \u03c4 3 [see panels (c)-(f)], the fraction of nodes that adopt product B is largest for a small interval of p Hip around p Hip \u2248 0.3. This is the single peak in the adoption of product B in the mean over these simulations. For \u03c4 = 2 [see panel (b)], product B is the more-popular product for large values of p Hip . For \u03c4 2 [see panels (b)-(f)], product B is the more-popular product for a p Hip interval starting at p Hip \u2248 0.20. The length of this interval increases with \u03c4 , and both the hipster probability that produces the peak fraction in this interval and (especially) the value of the peak fraction increase with \u03c4 . For \u03c4 = 6 [see panel (f)], the maximum fraction of nodes that adopt product B is about 0.90.",
