Memory B\u2010cell\u2010dependent models are based on the requirement of memory B cells to become activated, proliferate, and differentiate into antibody\u2010secreting daughter cells that intermittently or continuously repopulate the antibody\u2010secreting plasma cell pool. These models are based on either antigen\u2010specific stimulation via chronic infection, repeated infection, booster vaccination, persisting antigen in the form of immune complexes, or non\u2010antigen\u2010specific polyclonal B\u2010cell stimulation via Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) engagement or bystander T\u2010cell activation. There are also two models of memory B\u2010cell\u2010independent maintenance of long\u2010term antibody production, and these are based on the concept that memory B cells and plasma cells represent two independently regulated B\u2010cell populations and that the duration of antibody production by plasma cells is determined either by competition for space in immunological niches, such as the bone marrow, or is based on the principle that antigen\u2010specific plasma cells have a predetermined lifespan.",

            "text": "One mechanism for maintaining prolonged antibody responses is through continued antigen presentation or internal \u2018boosting\u2019 of the immune response by viruses that cause chronic infection (\nFig. 1\n). This model represents only a subset of potential immunological experiences, because many pathogens are unable to sustain a chronic or persistent infection. In these cases, memory B cells exposed to chronic viral or microbial antigens would be triggered to proliferate and differentiate into antibody\u2010secreting plasma cells and either maintain or even inflate serological memory through a memory B\u2010cell\u2010dependent mechanism. Alternatively, idiotypic networks or cross\u2010reactivity to environmental or self\u2010antigens may result in chronic stimulation of an antibody response. The potential for these latter models is debatable, since it would be difficult to envision how antigen\u2010specific affinity maturation would occur if the antibodies are reacting to other antibody molecules [i.e. idiotypic networks (2)] or to other self or environmental antigens, given that affinity maturation ceases shortly after vaccination and is resumed only after booster vaccination with the same antigen (3). Moreover, if continuous cross\u2010reactive B\u2010cell activation is the mechanism for maintaining long\u2010term antibody responses, then it is difficult to explain why some antibody responses decline whereas others are maintained for decades or in some cases for life. These types of discrepancies may indicate why the cross\u2010reactive models of humoral immunity have largely fallen out of favor in recent years.",

EBV\u2010specific antibody responses were maintained at steady\u2010state levels (T\n1/2 = 11 552 years; 95% CI, 63 years to infinity) (\nTable 1\n) with no significant decrease in titer over time [P = 0.99, (1)]. Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes a persistent infection that not only induces strong antiviral antibody responses but also causes \u2018immunological memory inflation\u2019 with virus\u2010specific antibody titers that continue to increase incrementally for years after infection (IJ Amanna and MK Slifka, unpublished data). In contrast, antibody responses against VZV declined slowly but significantly over time [P = 0.005, (1)] with an estimated 50\u2010year half\u2010life (95% CI, 30\u2013153 years) (\nTable 1\n). This time was substantially shorter than the calculated antibody half\u2010life of antibody responses mounted against other viruses that cause acute infection (\nTable 1\n) and indicates that a latent infection does not necessarily elicit the most durable antibody response. From a virological perspective, these results also indicate that when VZV is latent, it appears to be truly sequestered from the host immune system. This observation may also explain why pediatric vaccination against VZV, which is based on a live, attenuated herpesvirus (Varivax\u00ae, Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA) that can form latency (4, 5, 6) still requires booster vaccination in order to sustain protective immunity against natural VZV infection (1, 7).",

            "text": "One of the oldest and most commonly described models used to explain long\u2010term antibody responses is the persisting antigen model (\nFig. 1\n). In this scenario, foreign protein antigens persist on the surface of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) in the form of immune complexes, and these antigen:antibody complexes continuously stimulate resident memory B cells to proliferate and differentiate into antibody\u2010secreting plasma cells. Extensive studies on persisting antigen and the role of FDCs were performed in the 1970s and 1980s (24, 25) with some of the most influential research performed by Tew and Mandel (26). Using radiolabeled antigens, they demonstrated that injected protein does indeed persist in vivo and that the antigens appear to follow a biphasic rate of decay. Initially, greater than 99% of antigen is lost or degraded within the first 2\u20134 days with an antigen half\u2010life of \u226440 h (27). The next phase of decay is much slower, with an estimated half\u2010life of approximately 8 weeks (95% CI: 5.1\u201320 weeks). If antibody levels are maintained by continued or intermittent activation of memory B cells via persisting antigen in the form of immune complexes, and if one assumes that the ability of memory B cells to capture antigen, proliferate, and differentiate into antibody\u2010secreting cells (ASCs) does not decline over time, then the decay rate of serum antibody will be proportional to the decay rate of persisting antigen (\nFig. 1\n). If we use the high end of the 95% confidence interval for antigen persistence in vivo (i.e. 20 weeks or approximately 0.5 year), then antigen\u2010driven B\u2010cell activation should decline steadily over time and antibody responses should decay with approximately a 0.5\u2010year half\u2010life. This is in stark contrast to the durable antibody responses observed in human subjects following acute viral infection or immunization with tetanus or diphtheria toxoid vaccines (\nFig. 2\n, \nTable 1\n).",

            "text": "There is no doubt that antigen can persist in the form of immune complexes, and this property is important for the germinal center reaction as well as affinity maturation of the memory B\u2010cell response (24, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32). Indeed, antigen can be detected in lymphoid organs for weeks or months after injection (25, 31, 33), which is associated with prolonged germinal center reactions (30, 33). Although antigen can clearly persist, it is unlikely to persist forever. For instance, there is a finite limit to how much antigen can be bound to a particular FDC. According to published studies (27), it is estimated that approximately 300 000 antigen molecules can bind to the surface of an FDC. As noted previously (9), if antigen decays with an average of an 8\u2010week half\u2010life, then only one molecule of antigen would remain on the surface of an FDC after 3 years. Dendritic cell lifespan may also be a factor to consider, since these cells have an estimated lifespan of only days or weeks (34, 35, 36). Although memory B cells do not necessarily require CD4+ T\u2010cell help to persist (37, 38), if antigen is stimulating memory B cells, then the B cells are likely to consume the antigen (39, 40) and present it to CD4+ T cells. The maintenance of CD4+ T\u2010cell memory should result as an added benefit. However, studies have shown in mice (41) and in humans (13, 22, 42) that virus\u2010specific CD4+ T\u2010cell memory declines over time, even though antiviral antibody responses remain stable. Comparative analysis of CD4+ T\u2010cell memory and virus\u2010specific antibody responses following smallpox vaccination further showed that there is no correlation between the levels of T\u2010cell memory and antibody titers (13). Taken together, it is thus suggested that immune complexes and persisting antigen can play an important role in eliciting and maintaining the early stages of a humoral immune response, but it is unlikely to be the sole mechanism for maintaining antibody responses that can last >50 years (1, 13, 43).",

            "text": "Unlike other memory B\u2010cell\u2010dependent models of humoral immunity, the polyclonal stimulation model is based on non\u2010antigen\u2010specific, polyclonal stimulation of memory B cells through bystander T\u2010cell activation or TLR engagement. In this model, serum antibody production is maintained at levels that are proportional to the frequency of antigen\u2010specific memory B cells (44, 45). Ongoing or intermittent infection is thought to elicit cytokines and/or TLR activation of the memory B\u2010cell pool, which, in turn, triggers the B cells to proliferate and differentiate into antibody\u2010secreting plasma cells with an estimated 40\u2010day half\u2010life (44, 45). This model is based, in part, on compelling in vitro data demonstrating that memory B cells can be activated to divide and differentiate into ASCs following exposure to combinations of cytokines and TLR agonists such as CpG oligonucleotides (44). Indeed, TLR\u2010induced memory B\u2010cell activation (in conjunction with immunoglobulin crosslinking) is an effective means for measuring memory B\u2010cell frequencies in bulk culture (22, 46) or in limiting dilution assays (1, 47). In vivo, however, there is conflicting evidence for polyclonal stimulation of B cells playing a role in maintaining pre\u2010existing antibody responses. In the original study, tetanus vaccination was examined due to its ability to induce memory T\u2010cell activation and bystander T\u2010cell help. Within 5\u20137 days after booster tetanus vaccination, the frequency of ASCs in the peripheral blood that was specific for unrelated antigens such as measles or T. gondii appeared to increase by 5\u2010 to 10\u2010fold. Although serum titers to these antigens were not examined, one would predict that there would be a concomitant increase in serum antibody titers if these ASCs were involved with maintaining or increasing serum antibody levels (\nFig. 1\n). When tetanus\u2010specific antibody titers were examined, there was an expected antigen\u2010specific response with antibody titers increasing by about 80\u2010fold at the peak of the response and then declining over the ensuing weeks with an approximate 40\u2010day half\u2010life (44). Similar to other memory B\u2010cell\u2010dependent models, the polyclonal B\u2010cell activation theory represents a complex scenario in which continued infection or immune activation will be required in order to sustain antigen\u2010specific antibody levels for decades (\nFig. 2\n). Moreover, it requires a careful balance in proliferation with an equal distribution of daughter cells that enter the plasma cell pool while also repopulating the memory B\u2010cell pool to their original numbers \u2013 which remain remarkably stable over time (1, 22). It is unlikely that chronic infection is responsible for this form of non\u2010antigen\u2010specific memory B\u2010cell stimulation, since this would be expected to trigger memory B cells of all antigen specificities to proliferate/differentiate into antibody\u2010secreting daughter cells with a similar antibody half\u2010life. This model, however, does not fully explain the differences in antigen\u2010specific antibody maintenance observed in vivo (\nTable 1\n). If repeated acute heterologous infection is required to maintain antibody responses, then this may result in substantial variability in antibody responses over time, especially if plasma cells and their coinciding antibody levels have a 40\u2010day half\u2010life (44). Such a rapid decay rate, followed by spikes in reactivation/repopulation of peripheral plasma cells, would likely differ from year to year as well as between seasons within a given year if based on the frequency of contagious infections such as rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza, etc. However, longitudinal studies of multiple subjects over the course of one to two decades have indicated that antibody responses are not erratic (\nFig. 1\n) but instead undergo stable trends unless altered by antigen\u2010specific vaccination or infection\u2010based events (\nFig. 2\n). For instance, when analysis of antigen\u2010specific antibody responses to eight different antigens was performed for the first several weeks following smallpox vaccination (Subject 1, \nFig. 2\n), we found little or no effect on the levels of antibody responses to unrelated antigens (1). This finding is consistent with other independent studies conducted in mice (38, 48, 49) and in human subjects (8) in which an in vivo effect of heterologous vaccination or infection on pre\u2010existing serum antibody responses to unrelated antigens has not been observed. Although it appears unlikely that polyclonal memory B\u2010cell stimulation through heterologous infection\u2010related TLR engagement or bystander T\u2010cell activation is required for maintenance of long\u2010term antibody responses, it is still an interesting phenomenon. Learning why memory B cells do (or do not) respond to these types of inflammatory signals will be important for developing better vaccines, especially since TLR agonists represent an exciting area of future adjuvant development (50).",

            "text": "There are several lines of evidence indicating that plasma cells represent an independent B\u2010cell population that can be long\u2010lived in the absence of repopulation by memory B cells. First, studies involving tritium incorporation (51) or bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation (52) have shown that plasma cells can survive for long periods of time in the absence of cell division. Second, although memory B cells themselves are also quite long\u2010lived (1, 22), for each of the memory B\u2010cell\u2010dependent models of long\u2010term antibody production to be feasible, there needs to be a direct correlation between memory B\u2010cell numbers and antibody levels. In this regard, there are some studies that have identified this correlation (22, 44), whereas there are others who do not find a consistent correlation between memory B\u2010cell frequencies and antibody levels (1, 11, 53). Third, when memory B cells are depleted in animal models (54, 55, 56), plasma cell populations and antibody levels continue to persist for long periods of time. This is further supported by anecdotal evidence of sustained antibody responses to vaccine antigens in human subjects undergoing B\u2010cell ablative therapy with anti\u2010CD20 depletion (57). Although memory B cells may not be required for the long\u2010term maintenance of plasma cell populations, they still play a vital role in protective immunity by mounting secondary responses following exposure or re\u2010exposure to their specific antigen. For instance, adoptive transfer studies clearly show that memory B cells will rapidly expand and repopulate plasma cell numbers after booster vaccination with their specific antigen but will remain dormant and not respond to vaccination with an irrelevant antigen (38).",

            "text": "If plasma cells can be long\u2010lived, as these data suggest, then how is the duration of antibody production determined and regulated? The plasma cell competition model is based on the theory that plasma cells survive for long periods of time when residing in the appropriate niche or microenvironment but that they are eventually displaced through competition with newly generated migratory plasmablasts that compete with the older resident plasma cells for finite space in the survival niche (58). Once displaced, the terminally differentiated plasma cells are believed to be unable to regain localization within the niche and subsequently die. Unlike the polyclonal stimulation model that predicts an increase in antibody responses to unrelated antigens during or shortly after infection/vaccination, this model would predict that each new infection or vaccination would result in the loss of pre\u2010existing humoral immunity to unrelated antigens through the process of the new plasmablasts displacing pre\u2010existing plasma cells of other specificities. It is believed that 80\u201390% of long\u2010lived plasma cells reside in the bone marrow compartment (58, 59, 60, 61, 62), and one could argue that the rates of cell death by displacement would increase as the competition for limited space increases. Plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow as a function of age and thus one would predict that plasma cell competition would also increase with age. Continuing this line of thought, one would further predict that antibody responses should decay at a more rapid rate as a function of age, since plasma cells would be destroyed at a more rapid rate proportional to the loss of available space and proportionally higher competition in the bone marrow niche (\nFig. 1\n). In contrast, when longitudinal analysis of antigen\u2010specific antibody responses were performed in subjects in their 20s to 30s or in their 50s to 60s, there was no observable change in antibody maintenance patterns (1) (\nFig. 2\n). In other words, antibody responses against tetanus and diphtheria maintained more rapid decay rates regardless of an individual\u2019s age, whereas durable antibody responses against viruses such as measles, mumps, or rubella remained long\u2010lived regardless of age (\nTable 1\n). Based on these in vivo observations, it is difficult to conclude that plasma cell competition for space will adequately explain the differences in antibody response patterns (\nTable 1\n) and does not predict the durability of humoral immunity during advanced age (1) (\nFig. 2\n).",

In an attempt to explain the differential lifespan of antibody responses observed against different virus and vaccine antigens, we have developed a model of plasma cell longevity that is based on individual plasma cells being imprinted with a specific lifespan at the time of induction (\nFig. 3\n). Epigenetic imprinting of function is not a unique concept; we have previously demonstrated that individual virus\u2010specific memory B cells will differ with regard to the number of antibody\u2010secreting daughter cells that are produced following antigenic stimulation, and the antibody\u2010secreting daughter cells appear to have different antibody secretion rates that are unique to their cellular lineage (63). More recent studies have shown that B cells that receive T\u2010cell help will produce antibody\u2010secreting progeny cells that produce significantly more antibody on a per cell basis than B cells that were activated by antigen in the absence of T\u2010cell help (64). This finding suggests that the microenvironment and availability of T\u2010cell help can have a profound impact on the function that is imprinted on the plasma cells produced from a particular memory B\u2010cell.",

First, unlike memory B cells or intermediate ASC types such as plasmablasts [that maintain the ability to proliferate as well as secrete antibody (65)], plasma cells are terminally differentiated cells that by definition can no longer divide. Therefore in the absence of reconstitution by memory B cells, the duration of antigen\u2010specific serum antibody responses during the intervals between vaccinations or infections will be directly proportional to the lifespan of the antigen\u2010specific plasma cell populations. Second, unlike memory B cells, plasma cells lose the ability to sense and respond to antigenic changes in their environment. Memory B cells are highly adept at antigen capture due to maintaining high affinity antigen\u2010specific antibody molecules on their surface (66). Likewise, memory B cells are able to elicit and respond to T\u2010cell help through the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II as well as a number of adhesion molecules such as CD80 and CD86 (53). In contrast, plasma cells lose the expression of many mature B\u2010cell markers including MHC class II molecules (54), thus reducing their ability to elicit and respond to cognate T\u2010cell help. Although plasma cells will be directed to sites of inflammation (58), long\u2010term antibody production after resolution of infection or vaccination is often maintained by plasma cells in the bone marrow (60). The bone marrow compartment is also sequestered from the main sites of initial infection (skin, respiratory, and mucosal surfaces), thus further reducing but not eliminating antigenic exposure. Bearing these factors in mind, we believe that plasma cells will be unable to differentially respond to antigenic changes in their microenvironment and modify their specified lifespan.",

It may be based on the strength of the combined B\u2010cell signals that together provide an adjustable form of \u2018risk assessment\u2019 of the antigenic exposure incurred during initiation of the humoral immune response. If a naive B\u2010cell is exposed to soluble self protein or an unconjugated chemical molecule such as a free hapten, then little or no antibody response is induced, because there is no B\u2010cell receptor (BCR) crosslinking and no T\u2010cell help (\nFig. 3\n). During the germinal center reaction, soluble protein induces apoptosis, further eliminating antibody responses to soluble antigens (67). Even memory B cells are poorly responsive to soluble foreign proteins in the absence of T\u2010cell help (38), and this property may be important because it reduces the amount of antibody directed towards self\u2010antigens or induction of antibody responses to environmental or irrelevant antigens. For instance, B cells will respond effectively to a repetitive or particulate antigen such as the CMV gB protein on the surface of intact virus particles but are unable to respond effectively to gB protein in its soluble form (38). This may be one reason why protein aggregates complexed with adjuvants such as alum are much more immunogenic than soluble proteins administered in the absence of adjuvant.",

T\u2010cell\u2010independent antibody responses are typically short\u2010lived and maintained for only a few weeks or months. By comparison, T\u2010cell\u2010dependent antibody responses are typically longer lived than T\u2010cell\u2010independent responses. One example of a non\u2010repetitive T\u2010cell\u2010dependent antigen is tetanus toxoid. This antigen represents a foreign antigen in which CD4+ T\u2010cell responses will be induced and provide help to antigen\u2010specific B cells. Tetanus is not a repetitive antigen, and so there is low BCR crosslinking. Combined with the B\u2010cell signals obtained through cognate CD4+ T\u2010cell help, an antibody response will be induced that lasts for years or potentially for decades (\nTable 1\n). To achieve an even longer lifespan, the antigen\u2010specific B\u2010cell would require the combination of a foreign protein antigen (thus eliciting antigen\u2010specific CD4+ T\u2010cell help) with a highly repetitive antigenic structure to trigger capping of the BCR and presumably stronger signal transduction in the responding B cell. A virus particle provides an example of this form of repetitive antigen that would induce B cells to proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells with an increased lifespan. The underlying theory is that highly repetitive foreign antigens are associated with the presence of a microbial infection and that induction of a long\u2010term antibody response to microbial antigens provides a selective advantage to the host because it will prevent reinfection, in some cases for life (9). Foreign proteins that are not repetitive may still be from an infectious agent (e.g. tetanus toxin), but as a general rule, the programmed lifespan against these proteins would be more limited. An alternative explanation for the differences observed in the duration of humoral immunity against viruses versus vaccine antigens, such as tetanus and diphtheria (\nTable 1\n), is that live infections may trigger an inflammatory microenvironment that provides better stimulation or \u2018programming\u2019 than what might occur following vaccination with these particular non\u2010replicating antigens formulated in alum. In this regard, we have begun to examine the duration of immunity against another bacterial toxin, pertussis toxin, following natural infection with Bordetella pertussis, a Gram\u2010negative bacterium. Preliminary results indicate that the duration of immunity to the non\u2010repetitive pertussis toxin is similar to that observed for vaccine\u2010induced immunity against tetanus and diphtheria antigens (IJ Amanna and MK Slifka, unpublished data) and suggests that microbial infection and TLR activation may not be sufficient for inducing a lifelong antibody response. Although these studies are only preliminary and more work needs to be done, these data lead us to believe that the repetitive nature of the antigen (in combination with T\u2010cell help) is more critical than an inflammatory microenvironment in eliciting the most long\u2010lived antibody responses.",

            "text": "There are at least three reasons to limit the duration of an antibody response. First, the initial antibody response is often not class\u2010switched and is typically of low affinity. It would be unwise to make a long\u2010term low\u2010affinity antibody response if the host is capable of mounting a better, more specific antibody response after somatic mutation and affinity maturation. Interestingly, when the anti\u2010apoptotic gene Bcl\u2010xL was overexpressed in transgenic mice, the size or number of germinal centers was unchanged, but antigen\u2010specific antibody responses were mounted by a substantially higher proportion of low\u2010affinity ASCs (68). This observation indicates an important role for selection and apoptosis in culling suboptimal B cells and antibody\u2010secreting daughter cells from the long\u2010lived plasma cell pool. Second, if the antigen is non\u2010repetitive, then it might not be a microbial antigen or it might not be a protective surface antigen. For instance, mounting an antibody response to a highly repetitive glycoprotein on the surface of a virion is more likely to have neutralizing activity or other antiviral functions (69) and be more protective than mounting a long\u2010term antibody response to a non\u2010repetitive viral protein such as a viral DNA polymerase or RNA polymerase. It is clear that antibody responses to different human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) proteins will demonstrate dramatically different half\u2010lives (12), and it remains to be determined whether this is unique to HIV or whether there is a range of antibody half\u2010lives mounted against different components of a particular virus (or other microbe) in other model systems as well. Third, since there is a finite amount of space in the bone marrow for sustaining plasma cell numbers, it is important to modify the duration of the immune response and only direct lifelong immunity to the antigens that have the greatest likelihood of representing infectious agents. This way the bone marrow compartment is not overly populated with plasma cells of limited protective value. By allowing a range of plasma cell life spans to be developed, the loss of some relatively short\u2010lived plasma cells against low\u2010priority targets would allow more flexible space for the development and maintenance of new long\u2010lived plasma cells to new infectious agents. One potential outcome of this model is that as we age and the bone marrow compartment accumulates long\u2010lived plasma cells, it may be more difficult to induce a long\u2010lived antibody response to new antigens. Although only speculation, it may be one of the explanations for the difficulty in effectively vaccinating elderly individuals and opens an interesting area of future investigation.",

            "text": "A common but largely unrecognized complication with measurements of humoral immunity is that the calculated duration of serum antibody responses can be dramatically altered by which time points are used to measure antigen\u2010specific antibody kinetics (\nFig. 4\n). For instance, if serum antibody responses are measured during the first days or weeks after the peak of the response, then antibody decay rates will often be in the order of 20\u201340 days \u2013 suggesting induction of only a short\u2010lived antibody response. Since many of the early ASCs induced during vaccination or infection have a half\u2010life of only a few days (70, 71, 72, 73), the associated antibody response measured at early time points will be dictated largely by the lifespan of the immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules themselves. Studies have shown that although human IgG molecules have a half\u2010life of approximately 17.5\u201326 days (74, 75, 76), this differs among individuals, and antibody half\u2010life estimates of as high as 42 days (75) to as long as 80 days (77) have been observed under some circumstances. This recognition indicates that when antibody responses are measured immediately after vaccination and are determined to be less than 3\u20134 weeks duration, then the estimated lifespan of the surviving plasma cell populations will likely be skewed by the protein half\u2010life of IgG molecules and may not be indicative of the plasma cell half\u2010life per se. Within a few months after vaccination or acute infection, the rates of antibody decay will slow dramatically as the effects of free Ig are removed from the circulation through IgG catabolism (78) and antibody kinetics become more representative of the lifespan of the underlying plasma cell populations producing the antibody of interest (\nFig. 4\n). Interestingly, even if one waits 1\u20132 years after vaccination or infection before measuring the duration of immunity, it may still indicate an artificially short plasma cell lifespan. Previous studies have shown that antibody responses in humans do not reach steady state levels until approximately 2\u20133 years after infection or vaccination (79, 80), which is also apparent in the representative subjects shown in \nFig. 2\n. For Subject 1, the antibody responses to VZV, tetanus, diphtheria, and vaccinia declined rapidly during the first 3 years after the serospike and then were maintained with a longer half\u2010life with similar decay rates as that observed prior to the spike in antibody titers. Similar results were observed following tetanus and diphtheria vaccination of Subject 2; antibody responses declined most rapidly during the 2\u20133 years following vaccination before stabilizing into more long\u2010lived maintenance of serum antibody titers thereafter. There are a number of mechanisms that may explain these observations. First, it is possible that during the first 2\u20133 years following vaccination or infection, the antibody response is maintained by a combination of memory B\u2010cell\u2010dependent mechanisms (e.g. persisting antigen in the form of immune complexes on the surface of FDCs) and memory B\u2010cell\u2010independent mechanisms (i.e. long\u2010lived plasma cells). As antigen levels slowly decline, the memory B\u2010cell\u2010dependent pathway would subside, leaving only long\u2010lived plasma cells to remain and continue the production of antigen\u2010specific serum antibodies. Plasma cell repopulation by persisting antigen and memory B\u2010cell stimulation may explain why plasma cells at 6 weeks postimmunization were only temporarily depleted by coblockade of leukocyte function\u2010associated antigen\u20101 (LFA\u20101) and very late antigen\u20104 (VLA\u20104), whereas they remained depleted for up to 10 weeks when blockade of LFA\u20101 and VLA\u20104 was accompanied by depletion of CD20+ memory B cells (55). In addition, it is likely that there is a combination of short\u2010lived and long\u2010lived plasma cells that are generated during the course of a humoral immune response (70, 71, 72, 73, 81). Over time, the short\u2010lived plasma cells will decline, and this decline will eventually select for the plasma cells with the longest inherent lifespan. Unfortunately, it is not always feasible to monitor antigen\u2010specific antibody responses for multiple years after vaccination or infection, and it will be very useful if mathematical models can be developed that accurately predict the duration of an antibody response based on the kinetics of the immune response measured at earlier time points.",

However, these characteristics may not be the sole factors in determining how long an immune response will be maintained by a specific individual. During our analysis of the ONPRC cohort, we found one subject (Subject 4) in particular who mounted antibody responses of similar duration, regardless of the antigen tested (1). With the exception of antiviral responses to EBV that showed no evidence of decline, the antibody responses to the seven other virus and vaccine antigens declined with similar kinetics (estimated half\u2010life of 14\u201331 years). This finding was not due to general immune suppression or an inability to mount high antibody responses, since this subject demonstrated normal levels of humoral immunity to each of the antigens in addition to demonstrating a strong anamnestic antibody response following booster smallpox vaccination. However, this person was largely incapable of mounting the lifelong antibody response that was observed among other subjects following acute viral infections such as measles, mumps, rubella, or vaccinia (\nTable 1\n). Targeted genetic analysis of this individual (and perhaps others if identified in future studies) may provide clues into the complex cellular and molecular mechanisms that distinguish long\u2010term humoral immunity from lifelong humoral immunity.",

The longevity of these bone marrow\u2010resident cells is all the more impressive considering the stress of continually producing 10 000 to 20 000 molecules of Ig per second (82, 83, 84, 85). Current models of plasma cell longevity suggest that survival niches exist in the bone marrow that specifically support prolonged survival (86). For instance, plasma cells migrate to specific locations such as the bone marrow through chemokine signaling (e.g. CXCR4\u2010CXCL12) and are then supported through local molecular interactions (e.g. LFA\u20101/VLA\u20104 adhesion, or IL\u20105, IL\u20106 signaling, etc.).",

Few studies have focused on the in vivo effects of specific genetic deletions, especially on established antibody responses. For example, IL\u20106 was determined to be an important survival factor for bone marrow\u2010derived plasma cells in vitro, yet IL\u20106\u2010deficient mice show no long\u2010term humoral defects after immunization with ovalbumin, a prototypical T\u2010cell\u2010dependent antigen (87). This conclusion was supported by examining both ovalbumin\u2010specific antibody levels as well as bone marrow\u2010derived ASCs at 20\u201321 weeks postimmunization. Similarly, although newly formed plasma cells appear to be responsive to CXCL12 (the ligand for CXCR4) for a short period of time following emigration from the spleen (88), the importance of CXCR4 in orchestrating and maintaining long\u2010term antibody responses is less apparent. Initial results in a CXCR4\u2212/\u2212 chimeric mouse model suggested a defect in plasma cell accumulation in the bone marrow at days 7 to 14 postimmunization (89). Nevertheless, a conditional B\u2010lineage\u2010specific CXCR4\u2010deficient model also showed early defects in bone marrow accumulation of plasma cells following a T\u2010cell\u2010dependent response to NP\u2010KLH (day 9 postimmunization), but the mice demonstrated no long\u2010term defects in antibody levels, antibody affinity maturation, or plasma cell accumulation at 90 days postimmunization (90). This study indicates that these specific chemokines and cytokines are not absolutely required for plasma cell survival and illustrates the difficulty in dissecting individual mechanisms in a system wherein biological redundancy may be involved.",

Blimp\u20101 has long been known as a critical factor in terminal B\u2010cell differentiation, with the ability to act as a master gene regulator by directing sequence\u2010specific chromatin remodeling (91). Through its downregulation of Pax5 and upregulation of XBP1 (among many other roles), it is thought to simultaneously induce antibody secretion in plasma cells and initiate the unfolded\u2010protein response to deal with the stress of increased protein production (58). More recently, Blimp\u20101 has been shown to have a direct effect upon established humoral immune responses. By employing a conditional Blimp\u20101 knockout, investigators demonstrated that a previously established T\u2010cell\u2010dependent antibody response to NP\u2010KLH decreased significantly over time when compared to controls following loss of Blimp\u20101 expression (92). The loss of plasma cell function was verified independently by adoptive transfer studies. Nevertheless, while substantial progress has been made in determining the signals that induce Blimp\u20101 expression (LPS, CpG oligonucleotides, IL\u20102, IL\u20105, IL\u20106, IL\u201010, IL\u201021, etc.) (93), the in vivo signals that act directly on plasma cells remain undefined.",

Both of these proteins have the ability to bind the TNF receptors, TACI (transmembrane activator and calcium modulator ligand interactor) and BCMA (B\u2010cell maturation antigen), with the additional interaction of BAFF binding exclusively to the BAFF receptor (BAFF\u2010R) (94). The BAFF system is a well known survival and maturation network involved in peripheral B\u2010cell development, but its role in plasma cell development has been less characterized, due primarily to its upstream effects on normal B\u2010cell development. However, genetic deletion of BCMA in mice demonstrated that defects in this receptor led to decreased maintenance of long\u2010lived plasma cells in response to a T\u2010cell\u2010dependent antigen (95) despite antibody responses that appeared normal during the first 2 weeks of the immune response. This finding indicates that BCMA was not required for induction of a normal antibody response but was essential for its maintenance. Additional data implicating BAFF and/or APRIL in plasma cell maintenance has recently been described utilizing in vivo blockade with soluble versions of the BAFF receptor and TACI (which blocks both BAFF and APRIL) (96). In these experiments, mice were immunized with a T\u2010cell\u2010dependent antigen, rested for 3 months, and then subjected to in vivo blockade of BAFF or APRIL signaling. The blockade of either individual protein had no effect, but the simultaneous blockade of both BAFF and APRIL together led to a significant decrease in antigen\u2010specific plasma cells, strongly indicating a redundant and supportive role for both molecules in the long\u2010term survival of antigen\u2010specific plasma cells. Similar results were observed following in vivo blockade of the adhesion molecules LFA\u20101 and VLA\u20104 (55).",

Two independent studies have shown that long\u2010lived antibody responses against protein antigens (e.g. tetanus or diphtheria) range with half\u2010lives of about 10\u201320 years, whereas responses against acute viral infections show little to no decline (1, 12). One possibility is that the long\u2010term fate of each plasma cell is imprinted at the time of activation, perhaps related to BCR cross\u2010linking (\nFig. 3\n). This is an important biological mechanism, because it could be detrimental to the host if all antibody responses (especially low affinity responses or antibody responses cross\u2010reactive to self antigens) were long\u2010lived. Perhaps the additional BCR cross\u2010linking afforded by repetitive T\u2010cell\u2010dependent epitopes (such as viral particles) enhances the downstream molecular mechanisms required for long\u2010term survival. Additional signals delivered to the B\u2010cell at the time of activation could also play key roles in downstream longevity. For instance, mice deficient in the adapter protein SAP (SLAM\u2010associated protein) can initially mount normal levels of antibody, but long\u2010term antibody maintenance is greatly impaired (97). Adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that the defect was T\u2010cell intrinsic, because SAP\u2010deficient B cells mounted normal antibody responses in a normal host, whereas wildtype B cells could not mount long\u2010term antibody responses if T\u2010cell help came from SAP\u2010deficient T cells. More recent studies (98) have shown that SAP\u2010deficient T cells are suboptimal at forming long\u2010lived B\u2010cell:T\u2010cell conjugates in vivo, and it is presumed that such brief cell\u2010to\u2010cell interactions result in poor T\u2010cell help. This may explain why antibody responses in SAP\u2010deficient animals appear to mimic the kinetics and duration of T\u2010cell\u2010independent responses. T cells, however, are unlikely to be needed for long\u2010term plasma cell maintenance, since established long\u2010term antibody responses can be maintained even in the absence of T cells (38) or after T\u2010cell memory has declined (13). While progress has been made in dissecting the factors associated with development and maintenance of plasma cells, a stepwise roadmap of the signals that are necessary for this process remains to be determined.",

Several memory B\u2010cell (MBC)\u2010dependent and \u2010independent models have been developed to explain how long\u2010term antibody responses are maintained. In this figure, we illustrate how antigen\u2010specific antibody responses might be maintained under the different proposed models. Chronic infection or cross\u2010reactivity to either self or environmental antigens is expected to stimulate memory B cells to proliferate and differentiate into antibody\u2010secreting daughter cells and result in increasing antibody responses over time due to continuous stimulation and accumulation of memory B cells and plasma cells. Repeated infection or booster vaccination will likely lead to periodic increases in antigen\u2010specific memory B\u2010cell activation and subsequent increases in antibody responses that would decline during the intervening periods between outbreaks or vaccinations. Persisting antigen in the form of antibody:antigen immune complexes on the surface of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) will stimulate memory B cells in an antigen\u2010specific manner, resulting in antibody responses that will decline at the rate of antigen decay or consumption by the memory B\u2010cell pool. Non\u2010antigen\u2010specific polyclonal memory B\u2010cell stimulation by Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) engagement or bystander T\u2010cell activation will trigger antibody responses to spike during heterologous infections or vaccinations and increase antibody responses to all pre\u2010existing antibody specificities. Alternatively, long\u2010term antibody responses may be maintained by long\u2010lived plasma cells (PCs), and two models are proposed. One model is based on plasma cell competition for space in the bone marrow in which pre\u2010existing plasma cells are dislodged by incoming plasmablasts, and antibody responses decline as a function of plasma cell displacement. Since there is finite space in the bone marrow, this model would suggest that antibody responses will decline more rapidly during advanced age as a function of increased competition in the bone marrow compartment. Another model of long\u2010lived plasma cells is based on the theory that plasma cells are imprinted with a specified lifespan, which is determined during the induction phase of the antigen\u2010specific antibody response.",

As shown in \nTable 1\n, antibody responses to specific virus and vaccine antigens have significantly different lifespans. Since plasma cells secrete antibody and consequently lose expression of the membrane\u2010bound forms of immunoglobulin, it is unlikely that they can detect or respond to specific antigen in their environment. It is thus suggested that the antigen\u2010specific imprinting of the antibody response must occur during the interface between B cells and antigen during the induction of the humoral immune response. In this model, the combined signals through the B\u2010cell receptor and signals obtained through CD4+ T\u2010cell help will dictate the lifespan of antibody\u2010secreting plasma cells. For instance, if B cells are exposed to soluble, non\u2010repetitive self protein or an unconjugated free chemical hapten, then there is no cross\u2010linking of the B\u2010cell receptor (BCR) and no T\u2010cell help, resulting in weak and short\u2010lived antibody responses. If the antigen is highly repetitive, then the BCR will be cross\u2010linked and increase signal strength to the responding B cell. However, without concomitant T\u2010cell help, the T\u2010cell\u2010independent antibody response remains short\u2010lived \u2013 in the order of a few weeks or months. In contrast, if the antigen contains foreign protein, then the responding B\u2010cell will receive critical CD4+ T\u2010cell help and induce an antibody response that could last for decades (e.g. tetanus toxoid). If the foreign protein antigen is also highly repetitive (e.g. a protein on the surface of a virus particle), then the combination of increased signaling through the BCR together with CD4+ T\u2010cell help will induce plasma cell progeny with an extended lifespan and potentially provide life\u2010long immunity against reinfection. Since many microbes have highly repetitive structures (identified through Toll\u2010like receptor as well as other pattern recognition receptors), the potential risk to the mammalian host is determined by the repetitive nature of the antigen and the availability of T\u2010cell help.",

            "text": "Figure 4:  \nKinetics of a prototypical serum antibody response. The kinetics of an antigen\u2010specific antibody response does not typically follow a single rate of decay but instead will often follow a pattern involving at least three phases of antibody half\u2010life kinetics. Shortly after the peak in antibody production following acute infection or vaccination, antibody responses will decline rapidly, often at the rate of free IgG protein catabolism and removal from the serum [T\n1/2 = 17.5\u201326 days (74, 75, 76)]. For the next 1\u20133 years, antibody responses will be more long\u2010lived but will still decline more rapidly than antibody responses analyzed at >3 years after the antigenic insult when antibody production has reached steady\u2010state levels (1, 80). During the first 1\u20133 years after vaccination or infection, the antibody response may be maintained by a combination of memory B\u2010cell\u2010dependent mechanisms (e.g. persisting antigen on the surface of FDCs) and memory B\u2010cell\u2010independent mechanisms (i.e. long\u2010lived plasma cells), and in this case, the final, steady state antibody response would only become apparent once the antigen depot has been exhausted and is no longer contributing to the plasma cell pool. An alternative model that is not mutually exclusive to the persisting antigen model is that antibody responses elicited during the first few years after vaccination or infection may be produced by a mixed population of long\u2010lived and short\u2010lived plasma cells. Plasma cells with the shortest lifespan will decline over time, which will eventually select for the subset of plasma cells with the longest inherent lifespan. Bearing this in mind, the longevity of a given antigen\u2010specific antibody response might be considered short\u2010lived, moderately long\u2010lived, or very long\u2010lived, depending on the time frame in which the analysis is performed.",
