The disease was first described by Dr. Tomisaku Kawasaki 3 in Japan, and he recognized the first case in 1961. At that time, this disease was thought to be benign and the prognosis good because all acute symptoms disappeared within 2 or 3 weeks, and the patient was usually doing well. Yamamoto and Kimura 4 reported a case complicated with myocarditis; however, the presence of coronary artery involvement was not identified. In 1970, the first nationwide survey in Japan showed that 1.7% of the patients died from acute myocardial infarction; autopsies showed coronary arteritis accompanied by aneurysms and thrombotic occlusions. At that time, most pediatricians believed that Kawasaki disease was complicated with vasculitis only in small numbers of fatal cases, because of the great contrast in prognosis between these rare fatal cases and the large number of nonfatal cases that were asymptomatic. In 1973, Kato et al. 5 performed the coronary angiography in 20 infants and children when their acute symptoms had remitted. Twelve of these patients showed multiple coronary aneurysms in both the right and left coronary arteries, which was the first recognition that coronary artery aneurysms are present not only in fatal cases but also in survivors, even if the patient is free from cardiac symptoms.

These toxins are revealed to be superantigens capable of stimulating T cells carrying particular variable regions of the T-cell receptor \u03b2 chain. A study of peripheral blood T cells in KD patients showed that T cells expressing T-cell receptor variable regions V\u03b22 and V\u03b28 were selectively expanded. 14 These observations suggest that KD may be caused by a toxin (superantigen)-producing microorganism, including possibly a virus. Leung et al. 15 suggested that the expansion of V\u03b22+T cells in most patients with KD may be caused by a new clone of toxic shock syndrome toxin-secreting Staphylococcus aureus or SPEB (streptococcal pyogenic exotoxin-B)-or SPEC (streptococcal pyogenic exotoxin-C)-producing group A streptococci from studies on bacterial culture from patients with KD. 15 However, other studies did not support this theory. 16 Yoshioka et al. 17 reported that SPEC induces activation and polyclonal expansion of V\u03b22-and V\u03b26.5-positive T cells, and that SPEC-induced activation of T cells may lead to the pathogenesis of KD. 17 Yersinia pseudotuberculosis appears to be one of the etiologic agents of KD, 18 although only a small group of KD patients can be explained by this organism. Propionibacterium acnes was isolated from cervical lymph nodes of the patients, which produced the cytotoxic protein-like bacterial exotoxin, 19, 20 but its etiologic role remains to be determined. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) occasionally induced clinical pictures mimicking those of KD, 21 and three of 37 patients with chronic active EBV infection developed coronary lesions. However, epidemiologic, serologic, and virologic studies do not support that EBV is a causative agent of KD. Rowley et al. 22 reported that immunoglobulin A (IgA) plasma cells infiltrate the vascular wall as well as other tissues, such as the myocardium, respiratory tract, kidney, and pancreas in acute KD. They suggest a mucosal portal of entry of a conventional antigen; however, no specific microbe has been proposed as the etiologic agent. Recently, a possible association between novel human Corona virus (HcoV-NH) and KD was reported; however, further studies are necessary. 23 Acute phase of KD is associated with markedly increased production of inflammatory cytokines. Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2),and interferon-\u03b3 (IF-\u03b3) induce activation antigens and adhesion molecules, such as endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1) on endothelial cells, and TNF\u03b1 and IF-\u03b3 cause endothelial injury in in vitro studies. 24 Leung and associates 25 have proposed a hypothesis that antiendothelial antibodies cause endothelial injury in KD patients, based on the findings that circulating autoantibodies in KD were cytotoxic against human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, or IF-\u03b3. 25 Coronary artery endothelial cells in KD patients expressed activation antigens in one study. 26 Monocyte chemotactic and activating factor (MCAF or MCP-1) and TNF-\u03b1 may have important roles in the pathogenesis of arteritis. [27] [28] [29] Many hypotheses concerning the etiology and pathogenesis of KD have appeared; however, no host-microbe relationship specific to KD has been yet identified. Kawasaki disease patients are widely scattered in the community. They have self-limited disease, multiorgan involvement, and possible recurrence, and may have a tendency of epidemic development every 3 or 4 years.

It should be noted that death might occur at any time in the presence of obstructive lesions. Myocardial infarctions are relatively more frequent when the patient is sleeping or resting, and primary manifestations include shock symptoms, pallor, unrest, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

One patient had large common iliac artery aneurysms associated with dilatation of aorta. Although prognosis of systemic artery aneurysms is generally favorable, renovascular hypertension may develop in a patient having a renal artery lesion, and intrathoracic arterial lesions may present problems at the time of coronary bypass surgery.

We found acute mitral regurgitation in 28 patients among 2180 cases (1.3%); this disappeared in half of the patients after a few months to several years. The etiology of this condition may be valvulitis or papillary muscle dysfunction caused by ischemia. 33 Five patients presented with aortic regurgitation (0.2%).

The approach for 2D echo in KD is well described in the Japan KD Research Committee's standardization of diagnostic criteria and reporting of coronary artery lesions 35 and the committee report of the American Heart Association (AHA). 36 Some reports suggest that this approach may underestimate the true incidence of coronary artery dilatation. 37, 38 If a patient has abnormal findings on serial 2D echo studies, coronary angiography is indicated. 39 The evaluation of the coronary artery morphology is particularly important in KD patients. The method for evaluation by echocardiography is well described in the AHA scientific statement on KD published in 2004. 40 The precordial short-axis segment is the standard approach for evaluation of the left main coronary artery, left anterior descending artery, and right coronary artery. The posterior descending artery can be evaluated by the apical four-chamber view. The middle segment of the right coronary artery is seen by the apical four-chamber view. In our experience using 2D echo, it is possible to correctly diagnose left main coronary artery aneurysms with 98% sensitivity and 95% specificity compared to angiography. The echocardiographic evaluation for right coronary artery lesions was less sensitive. Falsenegative diagnoses were due mainly to the presence of isolated small peripheral coronary artery aneurysms, which were rare. From echocardiographic studies, it is evident that coronary artery dilatation appears at around 10 days of illness; approximately 40% of patients show coronary artery dilatation in this period. However, two thirds of these patients demonstrate a transient dilatation and regression within 3 to 5 weeks from the onset of illness (Fig. 41.2 ). This means that Kawasaki arteritis may cause the various degrees of coronary artery dilatation from mild transient dilatation, small or moderate-sized aneurysms, to giant aneurysms in more than half of the patients in the acute phase of the disease. 41 Aneurysms are classified as saccular if the axial and lateral diameters are nearly equal or as fusiform if symmetric dilatation with gradual proximal and distal tapering is seen. If the coronary artery diameter looks larger than normal without segmental dilatation, the coronary artery is considered ectatic. The follow-up echocardiography is essential to evaluate such findings to assess whether these are ectatic changes or normal variations. We performed 2D echocardiography at the time of diagnosis, at 8 to 10 days after the onset of illness when coronary dilatation may appear, and at 2 and 8 weeks after the onset. The sizes of coronary artery aneurysms are classified as small (<5 mm internal diameter), medium (5 to 8 mm) and giant or large (>8 mm). Acute coronary thrombosis is diagnosed by serial 2D echo. At that time, thrombolytic treatment using urokinase or tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is indicated. 42 The evaluation of stenotic lesions of the coronary artery by 2D echo is sometimes difficult; however, by using a high-frequency transducer and performing a careful examination, it may be possible.

If the patient has severe coronary artery lesions, other systemic vascular involvement such as the auxiliary, iliac, renal, or intrathoracic arteries aneurysms should also be evaluated. Because the regression of coronary artery aneurysms and progression to stenotic lesions occur within 2 years from the onset of illness, follow-up CAG are essential, especially in patients having coronary aneurysms. 31 The regression of coronary artery aneurysms is indicated when a follow-up CAG demonstrates normal findings in a patient who previously had coronary aneurysms.

The portion of the coronary artery with normal angiographic findings shows normal findings except in the region near the regressed aneurysm where mild intimal thickening exists. Positive remodeling (or compensatory remodeling) may contribute to maintain the normal lumen with mild intimal thickening. 46 Evaluation for Myocardial Ischemia Because the morbidity and mortality of this disease primarily depend on the extent of associated coronary artery disease, it is particularly important to assess accurately the presence of myocardial ischemia during follow-up. The conventional methods have some limitations. Two-dimensional echocardiography can detect coronary aneurysm; however, its evaluation of stenotic lesions is not satisfactory. Similarly, electrocardiographic sensitivity for detection of myocardial ischemia is insufficient. Coronary angiography is an accurate method to assess coronary artery involvement; however, repeated evaluation is often difficult because it is an invasive technique. Although exercise stress tests can detect myocardial ischemia, and this noninvasive technique is easy to repeat, its sensitivity is not sufficient, even in patients with significant coronary stenosis, and it is difficult to perform in young children. In this regard, myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using pharmacologic stress (dipyridamole infusion) is considered to be the most accurate diagnostic method for identifying myocardial ischemia, especially in children in whom an exercise test cannot be performed. Because pharmacologic stress SPECT studies provide quantitative analysis, changes in the severity of myocardial ischemia can be detected when consecutive studies were performed. Kamiya 47 reported that the sensitivity of detecting myocardial ischemia in patients having significant coronary artery stenoses was >75%. The most sensitive method was dipyridamole stress SPECT (85% sensitivity); the sensitivity of treadmill exercise tests was <50%. 48 Other stress tests reported in children with KD include nuclear perfusion scans with exercise, 49 exercise echocardiography, 50 stress echocardiography using dobutamine, 51 and contrast echocardiography with dipyridamole stress. 52", "cite_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 165, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 568, "end": 570, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2000, "end": 2002, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2261, "end": 2263, "text": "48", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2389, "end": 2391, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 2434, "end": 2436, "text": "51", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Coronary Angiography and Heart Catheterization"}, {"text": "Recommendations of treatment and management are described in an evidence-based grading scale of the American Medical Association.
