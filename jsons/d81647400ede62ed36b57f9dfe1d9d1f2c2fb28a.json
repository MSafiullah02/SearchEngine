This work proposes, evaluates, and compares further strategies for generating suggestions based on the initial consumer query, using multi-concept recognition and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). The evaluation was done with an English and a Portuguese test collection, considering as baseline the suggestions initially provided by Health Suggestions. Given the importance of understandability, we used measures that combine relevance and understandability, namely, uRBP and uRBPgr. Our best method merges the Consumer Health Vocabulary (CHV)-preferred expression for each concept identified in the initial query for lay suggestions and the UMLS-preferred expressions for medico-scientific suggestions. Multi-concept recognition was critical for this improvement.",

Authors used the CHV that maps technical terms to consumer-friendly language.

For each of these concepts, we select lay and medico-scientific expressions, concatenate them to compose the corresponding suggestions in English and, in the end, we translate them to the original language. All translations are done with Google Translator. Several strategies were analyzed for multi-concept recognition, and we decided to use MetaMap, a rule-based system of concept recognition, to discover UMLS concepts referred to in free text [2] , which is interesting because we use UMLS as our knowledge source. MetaMap provides a list of mappings for each identified concept. In each query suggestion method, we used two approaches to select the best mapping. In the first approach, we choose the first mapping, that is, the one with the highest score. In the second, we used the Word-Sense Disambiguation (WSD) feature that favors those that are semantically consistent with the surrounding text [3] . For each approach, we used the UMLS Concept Unique Identifier (CUI) and the name of the concepts as input.",

Using UMLS-preferred terms resulted in a better performance. Others explored broader terms, more specific terms, and similar terms but did not retrieve as good results. The best method to suggest lay queries is the one that uses the CHV-preferred expressions (the most familiar ones) to substitute the identified concepts. The best method to suggest medico-scientific suggestions uses UMLS-preferred expressions. These methods are better in the relevance and understandability but are also better in generation time. Since the word-sense disambiguation reduces the time that is necessary to generate new suggestions, and slightly improves or does not affect the overall performance, we conclude it should be used.",
