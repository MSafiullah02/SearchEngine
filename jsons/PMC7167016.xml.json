Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most commonly identified virus with detection rates up to 40\u201385% in infants hospitalized for respiratory infections during winter epidemics [Wang et al., 1995; Boyce et al., 2000; Black, 2003]. The clinical manifestations range from a simple common cold to severe lower respiratory tract symptoms requiring mechanical ventilation. About 6\u201311% of the children admitted to hospital with RSV infection require intensive care admission [Purcell and Fergie, 2004; Berger et al., 2009]. Up to 35% of the children hospitalized with bronchiolitis did not receive any supportive intervention [Mansbach et al., 2008]. On the other hand, it is crucial to avoid discharge of those children who may experience clinical deterioration. Among children sent home with the diagnosis bronchiolitis, 4.6\u20136.8% required hospitalization later on during infection [Roback and Baskin, 1997; Norwood et al., 2010]. Biomarkers to assess severity of viral lower respiratory tract infections, in particular RSV infection, may be helpful to clinicians in the decision whether a child needs to be hospitalized.",

            "text": "Lung injury during severe RSV infection is thought to be mediated by both direct cytotoxic effects of the virus and the result of the induced inflammation. Pathologic features of severe RSV infection include extensive bronchiolar epithelial destruction, peribronchial lymphocyte infiltration, necrosis of bronchial epithelium, and mucus plugs in the small bronchioles [Johnson et al., 2007; Welliver et al., 2008]. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are family of zinc endopeptidases capable of degrading components of the cellular matrix, and consequently, are suggested to be important in several diseases associated with tissue remodeling. Pronounced increase in their expression is thought to be associated with a variety of inflammatory disease, including respiratory diseases [Greenlee et al., 2007].",

            "text": "MMPs play a role in cellular migration of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and other immune cells to the lungs by degrading extracellular matrix, but also have pro\u2010 and anti\u2010inflammatory properties. The activity of MMPs is regulated through binding to tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) leading to inactivation. An imbalance in production and activation, or inactivation by TIMPs might augment airway inflammation through direct or indirect effects upon signaling pathways that influence migration of leukocytes through the tissues [Greenlee et al., 2007; Schuurhof et al., 2012]. Increased concentrations and activity of MMP\u20108 and MMP\u20109 have been observed in respiratory samples obtained from adults and children with acute lung injury and pneumonia [Hartog et al., 2003; Fligiel et al., 2006; Schaaf et al., 2008; Kong et al., 2009] as well as in chronic lung diseases such as asthma [Prikk et al., 2002; Obase et al., 2010]. In addition, a relation between MMP\u20109 concentrations and disease severity of pneumonia [Hartog et al., 2003; Schaaf et al., 2008] and asthma [Belleguic et al., 2002; Mattos et al., 2002] has been described.",

Ramilo et al.

In an experimental model of viral infection of the upper respiratory tract in adults with RSV, influenza, and RV, no up\u2010regulation of MMP\u20108 and MMP\u20109 was detected in whole blood transcriptional profiles [Zaas et al., 2009].

Currently, more standardized methods have been developed, such as flocked swabs, which can be used for viral diagnostics as well as protein analysis [Dezzutti et al., 2011; Munywoki et al., 2011]. Normalization of protein levels to stable metabolites present in the mucus might further improve the use of nasopharyngeal samples for diagnostics, although these methods are not available yet.

Also inflammatory mediators, such as growth factors, pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress upon viral infection can induce elevated gene expression levels of MMPs [Greenlee et al., 2007]. It has also been shown that the lung injury caused by mechanical ventilation has resulted in increased MMP\u20108 and MMP\u20109 expression [Albaiceta et al., 2010].

It has been shown that MMP\u20109 gene expression is increased in human airway epithelial cell lines infected with RSV [Yeo et al., 2002]. However, another study indicated that infected human airway epithelial cells are not the primary source of MMPs and TIMP\u20101 and that infiltrating leukocytes are responsible for MMP\u20109 in airway samples [Elliott et al., 2007]. Also in a RSV infection model in mice, of which it is known that the epithelial cells are not infected, it was demonstrated that gene expression of MMP\u20109 is elevated in the lungs most likely by infiltrating cells [Li and Shen, 2007]. For MMP\u20108, no correlation with neutrophil counts was observed and gene expression levels in granulocytes and PBMCs were comparable indicating that MMP\u20108 transcription and secretion was different regulated than MMP\u20109. This is supported by differences in the degranulation of subcellular neutrophilic granules, in which MMP\u20108 and MMP\u20109 are stored [Faurschou and Borregaard, 2003] and differences in transcriptional events that induce MMP\u20108 and MMP\u20109 mRNA expression. For example, it has been shown that pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL\u20101\u03b2, play a central role in the modulation of MMP\u20108 expression [Knauper et al., 1993; Abe et al., 2001].
