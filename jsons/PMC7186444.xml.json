Concerning fever, a body temperature over 38\u00b0C is being used as a cutoff to direct patients to medical examination, followed by tests for SARS-CoV2 and, if necessary, isolation and adequate treatment (5). While fever and cough are the most present symptoms, other less prevalent respiratory (shortness of breath and sputum production) and gastrointestinal (diarrhea) symptoms can be observed (6\u20139), suggesting differences in the viral tropism of COVID-19 compared to influenza. At this moment, fever, excessive nasal mucosa discharge (rhinorrhea), and muscle pain are predominant characteristics in COVID-19 (4, 10). Thus, evaluating these signs and symptoms before the practice of physical activity should be considered. It is important to note that the infected do not present any symptoms during the incubation period, and the incubation period can last for 5.5 days on average (11). However, the symptoms appear on average of 11.5 after the infection (11). Thus, these symptoms should be questioned daily. For this reason, as determined by the ACSM (2020), those who do not present signs and symptoms of the disease should be able continue to exercise regularly.",

However, in the presence of symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, and dyspnea), the practice of physical activity should be interrupted and medical assistance sought (18).

Temperature evaluation seems to be a pertinent pre-participation evaluation. Although non-specific symptom, it is one of the main symptoms of COVID-19, and, during the pandemic, it presents as a method with good sensitivity and ability to identify potentially contaminated people. As an example, a study of 138 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, documented that fever was present in 98.6% (136/138) of hospitalized patients. The other two patients who did not have fever were in intensive care unit beds, which may make us think of two situations: (a) they could have been medicated, which masks the result, and (b) the feverish state is not an indicator of the severity of the disease (19). However, restrictions based only on body temperature may not be sufficient and must be associated with other findings.

The Pre-Exercise Screening Questionnaire (PESQ) aims to quickly detect symptoms of COVID-19 to assess a person's readiness for physical exercise. This is prudent to avoid the potential risk of exacerbation of respiratory symptoms when starting exercise. The PESQ has seven questions that should be answered with a yes or no. Item 1 measures sore throat. Item 2 measures cough and sputum production. Item 3 measures fatigue. Item 4 measures shortness of breath or difficulty of breathing. Item 5 and 6 are related to fever, and Item 7 is related to any contact with anyone who has been diagnosed or suspected of the new coronavirus.",
