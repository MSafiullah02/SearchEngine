Exposure to asbestos can result in pleural lung fibrosis, and inhaled asbestos may cause peritoneal malignant mesothelioma and lung cancer (\n1\n). It is estimated that occupationally related asbestos exposure contributes to ~5\u20137% of all lung cancer cases (\n2\n). Although the use of asbestos has been banned or severely restricted since early 1970s in many developed countries, asbestos-related lung diseases still pose a great public health threat because of a long-latency period from asbestos exposure to the incidence of asbestos-induced diseases (\n3\n). Genetic factors have been suggested to be involved in asbestos-related carcinogenesis and lung genotoxicity by causing oxidative stress, inflammation, DNA damage-repair response, mutations, chromosomal aberrations, mitochondrial malfunction and apoptosis (\n4\n,\n5\n). To date, the impact of individual genetic variations on asbestos-related lung cancer risk is still not well understood. A small number of studies using a candidate gene approach reported that polymorphisms in genes encoding xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (e.g.\nGSTM1\n,\nGSTT1\n,\nMPO\n,\nCYP1A1\nand\nCYP2E1\n) and manganese superoxide dismutase (e.g.\nSOD2\nand\nMnSOD\n) were associated with asbestos-related lung cancer risk (\n6\u20138\n).\n",

However, even the most significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in GWASs have only accounted for a small proportion of the estimated heritability (\n11\n). Besides rare variants and structural variants, gene\u2013environment interaction is expected to be a possible source of missing heritability not explained by current GWASs (\n12\n,\n13\n). Although environmental factors, such as tobacco smoke and asbestos exposure, play an important role in lung cancer development, few reported studies have investigated the potential of the genome-wide gene\u2013environment interactions following the initial findings of lung cancer GWASs. Because current GWASs have been designed to detect the main effect of genetic variants, which often suffer from inadequate sample sizes, the ability to detect gene\u2013environment interactions even in the single SNP analysis has been limited (\n14\n).\n",

In the\ni\n-GSEA analysis, we use the maximum \u2013log (\nP\n-value) or statistics of all the SNPs mapped to a gene to represent the gene (\nt\n). Then, we ranked all genes in GWAS by decreasing values, and the genes at the top 5% with the small\nP\n-values were considered statistically significant. For each given pathway S, significance proportion-based enrichment score was calculated to estimate the enrichment of genotype\u2013phenotype association in a particular gene set S. Then,\ni\n-GSEA performed label permutations to calculate nominal\nP\n-values to assess the significance of the pathway-based enrichment score and the false discovery rate (FDR) to correct multiple testing.\ni\n-GSEA was implemented by using SNP-label permutations instead of phenotype-label permutations in a classical GSEA in order to calculate nominal\nP-\nvalues. Moreover,\ni\n-GSEA focuses on the pathways or gene sets with the highest proportions of significant genes instead of relying solely on the total significance generated from either a few or many significant genes, thus improving the sensitivity to identify pathways or gene sets that represent the combined effects of all possibly modest SNPs/genes. Since\ni\n-GSEA uses\nP-\nvalues at both SNP and gene levels as input data, it was convenient to perform the pathway-based analysis in the existing GWAS dataset, especially for the GWAS gene\u2013environment interaction analysis. For\nP\n-values at the SNP level, we mapped all SNPs within 20kb around a gene estimated precisely for the association of a gene. Considering the relatively low coverage of Illumina HumanHap300 v1.1 BeadChips, we also compared the results by mapping SNPs within 20kb around the gene and by mapping SNPs within 100kb around the gene. Next, the canonical pathways or gene sets were used for further pathway analyses. These canonical pathways were extracted and curated from Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) v2.5 (\nhttp://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/\n) (\n22\n). MSigDB included gene sets denoting canonical pathways integrated from a variety of online resources like KEGG (\n23\n), signal transduction knowledge environment (Science Signaling, [\n24\n]), BioCarta (\n25\n), GO (gene ontology) terms with high confidence (\n26\n). To reduce the multiple-testing issue and to avoid too narrow or too broadly defined pathways, we restricted our analysis to pathways with 20\u2013200 genes as the default (\n27\n). Pathways or gene sets with FDR < 0.25 were regarded as mild confidence that the G \u00d7 E interactions were enriched in a pathway; FDR < 0.05 were regarded as high confidence that the interactions were enriched in a gene or pathway.\n",

            "text": "\nThe second significant pathway, the antigen processing and presentation pathway, is involved in the regulation of immune function, consisting of a subgroup of human immune-system genes set in the major histocompatibilty complex (\n46\n). The genes in this pathway help to discriminate and present antigens to T-cell receptors, natural killer cells and other immune cells (\n47\n), and studies have found that asbestos can disturb autoimmunity and tumor immunity, while inducing DNA damage and apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells (\n48\n,\n49\n). This is because asbestos possesses the super antigenic capacity against T cells and the restricted overexpression of the T-cells receptor V beta without clonal expansion (\n50\n). In addition, the function of natural killer cells and regulatory T cells was depressed when they were exposed to asbestos (\n51\n). If the immune function is impaired as a result of the asbestos-induced pathogenesis, genetic variations in these pathways will modulate the risk of asbestos-related diseases, including lung cancer. The findings of gene\u2013asbestos interactions at levels of SNP, gene and pathway are seemingly not consistent for specific genes or specific chromosome regions in this study, but it is of interest that all the interactions at these three levels seem to tend to point to the genes or pathways involved in immune function regulation, which might be one of the possible mechanisms involved in the asbestos-related carcinogenesis.\n",

            "text": "\nSome limitations in this study should be addressed. One limitation was the use of self-reported asbestos exposure. Our previous study had shown that risk estimates for interactions of genetic variants with self-reported asbestos exposure, self-reported occupational exposure and self-reported employment in asbestos-related industries were similar, in which all these asbestos exposure measurements were reviewed and confirmed by a certified industrial hygienist (\n6\n), although reporting bias may still exist. Second, the coverage of the genotyping chip in this study is relatively low. A single SNP may be simultaneously mapped on nearby genes in the gene\u2013asbestos interaction analyses, which may lead to errors in the analyses at the gene and pathway levels. Third, we did not have the access to similar datasets available for us to replicate our findings. This may be due to a myriad of reasons, some of which include lack of asbestos exposure data in publicly available lung cancer GWAS datasets and/or the lack of common or comparable definitions for asbestos exposure. Furthermore, the current pathway-based analysis assumes that the local SNP only modify the function of the local gene, which is only partially true. The\ncis\nand\ntrans\nregulation of the genes should be considered in the future pathway-based analysis. In addition, for the limitation of relatively small sample size, we have not performed the stratified G \u00d7 E interactions analyses by histology, but the most informative gene\u2013environment interactions between asbestos exposure and lung cancer risk could only be determined in large cohorts of patients with the histology of interest associated with that exposure. Despite these limitations, our study demonstrated the advantage of performing the pathway-based analysis that integrates biological knowledge and biostatistics approaches, thus forming a useful and important tool for analyzing data from existing GWASs and the forthcoming whole genome sequence association studies (\n52\n,\n53\n).\n",
