This finding is in agreement with three previous studies that have connected HRV-associated wheezing to specific sensitization, nasal and systemic eosinophilia, and clinically diagnosed atopic eczema in separate reports (6, 8, 9) . Moreover, Hyva\u00a8rinen et al. (2005) (19) found HRV infection to be dependent on atopy-related 7) found HRV-associated wheezing during the third year of life to be independent risk factor for asthma at age 6 , and HRV was eightfold stronger risk factor than aeroallergen sensitization. Although Rakes et al. (1999) (8) found link between eosinophils and HRV infection that they also reported that HRV-negative wheezing children had more often specific sensitization than HRV-positive wheezing children. HRV diagnostics are based almost exclusively on PCR. Considering the tremendous sensitivity of PCR-based HRV assay, does it detect true acute infections or likely remnants from past distant infections? HRV has been detected in up to 40% in asymptomatic children (8) . It may represent a low-level infection without associated symptoms, although it is difficult to prove that a young child is totally asymptomatic. There is also evidence that positive HRV PCR finding may also represent the first sign of a developing clinical illness in about 14% to 38% of asymptomatic cases (12, 20) . There are three other arguments suggesting that HRV PCR is likely to detect true infections, whether symptoms are present or not, and argue against the suggestion that viruses detected by PCR are likely to be residual nucleic acids left over from distant infections. First, the proportion of persistent or recurrent viral infections with same HRV strain is <5% even in immunocompromised subjects (12, 21) . Second, although HRV detection rates are high in asymptomatic subject, HRV, any virus and mixed viral etiology has correlated with illness severity (12) .

First, atopic inflammation may increase the expression of the major HRV receptor, ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) (23). The increased receptor levels are likely to lead to more severe HRV infections. In agreement, atopic individuals have shown more severe illnesses after experimental HRV inoculation, although there are also contradictory reports (23, 24) . This mechanism does not apply to minor HRV group. Second, T helper 2 (Th 2 ) cell-polarized immune responses counteract Th 1 responses such as interferon-gamma, which belongs to nonspecific defense mechanisms against viral infections (23, 24) . Subjects with low interferon production have had greater susceptibility to HRV infections. Third, a recent in vitro study showed that disrupted airway epithelium favoured HRV replication (25) . Interestingly, damaged airway epithelium opened the way to deeper cell layers where HRV replicated the most and also increased the number of its own receptor ICAM-1. Airway epithelium could be damaged by allergic inflammation, repeated respiratory infections, and/or by air pollution. Fourth, high genetic diversity is a particular feature of HRV and makes it special from other viruses. Today, 99-101 HRV serotypes and over 150 different HRV genotypes have been found (23, 26) . Rhinoviruses elicit serotype-specific immunoresponses and are able to infect repeatedly with different strains. Naturally, the high diversity and prevalence of HRV increase the odds that they could be associated with acute wheezing without causality. Fifth, HRV-associated wheezing increases with age as does atopy. Thus, the interaction between them is likely to be stronger by increasing age. Therefore, we speculate that at young ages, when sensitization has not yet developed, the link may be more stronger between eosinophil levels and HRV infection. Of note, the close association between enterovirus infection and eosinophilia may be explained by their phylogenetic similarity to HRV.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 449, "end": 453, "text": "(23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 454, "end": 457, "text": "24)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 694, "end": 698, "text": "(23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 699, "end": 702, "text": "24)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 892, "end": 896, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1372, "text": "(23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1373, "end": 1376, "text": "26)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The negative association between RSVinduced wheezing and certain atopy-related markers, such as nasal and blood eosinophils, exhaled nitric oxide, and total IgE, is in agreement with three previous reports which have shown no association between RSV-induced bronchiolitis and sensitization status, eosinophil levels or presence of atopic eczema (6, 8, 9) . Moreover, in two long-term follow-up studies, a history of RSV-induced bronchiolitis or lower respiratory tract infection has been unrelated to atopy status at ages 7, 11, and 18-20 (27-29) . One study even reported a reduction in skin prick test positivity at the age of 6-10 in children with a history of hospitalization for RSV-induced lower respiratory tract infection when compared to matched controls (30) . On the contrary, only one study has shown an increased association between RSV-induced bronchiolitis and sensitization to common allergens compared to matched controls at the age of 13 (31) . The negative/no association could be explained by several ways. First, RSV-affected children are typically young, median of 11 months in our study, and sensitization rates and eosinophil levels are very low during infancy. Second, RSV may not be truly linked to atopy in contrast to HRV, because we did not find positive link between sole RSV infection and atopic characteristics even in older children.
