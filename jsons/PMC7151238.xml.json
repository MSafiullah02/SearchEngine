To estimate the confidence interval of the transmission rate from these \u2018zero numerator\u2019 data, we used the \u2018rule of three\u2019 statistical method.26 With no events in a series of 202 cases, the upper 95% confidence limit of the transmission rate is unlikely to be >1.5%. A larger series is necessary to give greater confidence. Recent narrative publications are also reassuring that, with similar PPE to that described here, the risk of disease transmission to healthcare workers is very low.14\n,\n15 There remains uncertainty and variable practice regarding PPE globally, and some recommend lower levels of PPE (e.g. either face shield or eye goggles rather than both).27, 28, 29 Outcome data, or the association between level of PPE and coronavirus transmission from the current epidemic, are lacking and require further investigation. During the SARS epidemic, besides non-compliance with appropriate precautions and lack of trained and monitored practices in the use of PPE, the recommended practices themselves were considered to have contributed to healthcare worker infection. As it had become so complicated, errors were likely unavoidable opportunities for transmission through contamination during donning or doffing of PPE.30\n",

Large volume ventilation and recruitment manoeuvres to correct hypoxaemia immediately after tracheal intubation should be avoided. A protective ventilation strategy with small tidal volumes (e.g. 6 ml kg\u22121\nideal body weight) maintaining lower airway pressures is recommended. Early prone ventilation should be considered, especially where peak pressure or driving pressure is high. Methods to identify or exclude pneumothorax (e.g. chest radiography and point-of-care ultrasound) should be available immediately after tracheal intubation to enable prompt diagnosis.\n",

Others have reported 28 day mortality of up to 61% in critically ill patients with COVID-19.34 The 24 h mortality may be related to events at tracheal intubation, but our observational data do not allow further analysis of this. Cardiac arrest at the time of tracheal intubation of the critically ill is associated with a 3.9-fold increase in the risk of 28 day mortality. High rates of mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 are predominantly because of the severity and speed of the illness associated with SARS-CoV-2 and the lack of effective antiviral treatment. Limited medical resources during a pandemic when the healthcare system is overloaded likely contribute to delays in tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Provision of sufficient critical care facilities and services to enable timely tracheal intubation and invasive ventilation might logically improve survival, but is unproved and is a major challenge during an epidemic surge. Research should explore whether optimal airway management at the time of intubation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 improves overall outcome.",
