            "text": "The roots of the PP account go back to basic motor learning principles in the sense that the brain has to generate predictions of the organism\u2019s own motor outcomes (Helmholtz, 1867; for reviews on the theoretical origins, see Clark, 2013; Schubotz, 2015). This basic principle has recently been generalized and discussed as a basic working principle of the human brain (e.g., Friston, 2005, 2010). The principal problem the brain has to solve is the successful behavioral navigation in a dynamic physical and social environment. Every novel situation comes with uncertainties, which result from incomplete, noisy, and sparse sensory information. When perceiving and interacting with the environment, the brain has to deal with these uncertainties by making inferences and generating appropriate behavioral responses (Friston, 2005, 2010). That is, sensory inputs provide only highly incomplete information about a complex environment, and the sensory information available to the organism is highly variable and changes with its behavioral navigation. It is therefore essential for the brain to improve inferences on the basis of sensory inputs and minimizing prediction errors (Clark, 2013; Friston, 2005, 2010; Hohwy, 2007; Kwisthout, Bekkering, & van Rooij, 2017). As prediction errors are reduced, the accuracy of internal predictive models is increased (Friston, 2005, 2010). However, predictive models should not be misunderstood as rigid solutions to reoccurring situations but as a likelihood maximization of generative models based on former experiences. The adaptability of predictive models allows for adjustments to changing environments, including new social and physical contexts. Thus, the refinement of predictive models (i.e., the reduction of prediction errors) through learning allows the organism to interact with the environment in more and more competent ways.",

Prediction errors are sent back to higher levels in the hierarchy, where the prediction was made, to update existing predictions and thereby improve predictive models.",

If the ball has rolled away in the meantime, the prediction error (grabbing air instead of ball) is fed back to higher order areas involved in the prediction. The infant can now update their predictions on how the ball behaves (perceptual inference) or change the sensory input by moving their arm to where the ball is located (active inference) to minimize the prediction error. Yet, on a higher hierarchical level, the infant may understand that this ball was too fast for them to reach or even too far away, such that the infant would have to relocate their body to be able to reach the ball.",

In their seminal work, Saffran, Aslin, and Newport (1996) showed that infants learn to segment artificial language on the basis of statistical information such as transitional probabilities between elements. In the habituation phase of their experiment, they presented 8-month-old infants pseudowords consisting of syllables that always followed each other (i.e., transitional probability of 1.0). In the test phase, they showed infants previously presented pseudowords as well as nonwords and used a novel syllable order. Infants looked longer at nonwords, which indicated that they learned the predictive structure of the pseudowords (for a recent review, see Saffran & Kirkham, 2018). Today, infants\u2019 statistical learning has been investigated extensively within different domains, including visual (Kirkham, Slemmer, & Johnson, 2002) and action domains (Monroy, Gerson, & Hunnius, 2017).",

            "text": "From early on, infants also learn about the consequences of their own actions in the environment. Rovee-Collier (1999) demonstrated that from 2 months onward, infants learned that a mobile connected to their feet moved in response to their own movement, as indicated by an increased kicking rate, in contrast to a condition in which the mobile was not connected to their feet. Infants even further increased their kicking rate when the mobile was disconnected, which indicates that they were trying to reproduce the effect (for a review, see Gerhardstein, Dickerson, Miller, & Hipp, 2012). Critically, computer simulations suggest that infants\u2019 increased kicking in the absence of an effect cannot be explained by simple action-effect binding, but it rather indicates that infants formed a causal link between the effect and their actions (Zaadnoordijk, Otworowska, Kwisthout, & Hunnius, 2018). The authors showed that a simulated infant robot, functioning on operant-conditioning principles without representing cause\u2013effect relations, also increased its kicking rate when it was connected to the mobile but did not further increase its kicking after the mobile was disconnected. This finding suggests that infants represent their own actions (i.e., kicking) as the cause of effects in the world (i.e., moving mobile). This idea is in line with the idea that infants build up predictive models in interaction with their environment. When the effect ceases to appear (i.e., disconnected mobile), a prediction error occurs, and infants increase their effort (active inference) to adjust the world to their predictive models.",

Furthermore, 6- to 10-month-old infants with high competencies to perform goal-directed grasping actions themselves are also better at predicting goal-directed grasping actions performed by others (Kanakogi & Itakura, 2011). Thus, infants seem to be able to use their own action-effect representations to make predictions about other agents\u2019 action goals, which suggests a close link between action generation and prediction (see also Keysers & Perrett, 2004).",

In the form of forward models, these internal models can then be used to predict the consequences of one\u2019s own actions as well as the goals of another person\u2019s actions, which allows for (intention-based) imitation learning. Although the earliest forward models in motor development that likely begin to be formed in utero may not necessarily depend on prediction errors, later imitation learning seems to be, at least partly, fueled by infants\u2019 drive to minimize prediction error. For instance, infants are more likely to imitate a novel action when it is unexpected (e.g., because it is inefficient given the situational constraints of the model; Gergely, Bekkering, & Kir\u00e1ly, 2002). Observing such unexpected actions induces increased motor activation in the infant brain, which potentially reflects the updating of prior action predictions (Langeloh et al., 2018).",

Walking upright provides infants with a novel view on their physical world (Campos et al., 2000; Franchak, Kretch, Soska, & Adolph, 2011) that demands that they form novel predictive (proprioceptive and visual) models of the outcomes of their newly acquired actions. This has been shown for infants\u2019 wariness of heights. Just when infants begin to walk upright, they tend to readily walk and fall down a steep cliff of 90 cm (Adolph, 2000), whereas they would not, at the same age, go down this cliff in a crawling posture. However, when infants had experiences with upright walking in a baby walker, before they had begun to walk autonomously (i.e., making similar proprioceptive and visual experiences as in a walking posture), they could estimate the height of the cliff and avoid it (Dahl et al., 2013). Thus, infants adjust their predictive models about their novel abilities to interact with the environment on the basis of their prior sensory experiences (i.e., making sensory and active inferences; see also Anderson et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Given the uncertainties that come with infants\u2019 emerging capacities for walking, why do infants begin to walk in the first place? In developmental robotics, the imperative to learn about one\u2019s own motor capacities is often cast in terms of an intrinsic motivation (see also the concept of motor babbling; Barto, Mirolli, & Baldassarre, 2013; Friston et al., 2015, Kaplan & Oudeyer, 2007; Schmidhuber, 2010). We argue that intrinsic motivation is an integral aspect of PP that forms an important component of active inference. In active inference, agents form not only inferences about the causal structure that underlies their sensations but also inferences about specific actions that will minimize prediction error in the long run (Attias, 2003; Botvinick & Toussaint, 2012; Friston et al., 2015). That is, agents select those actions that resolve the greatest amount of uncertainty or, in short, that resolve uncertainty about \u201cwhat would happen if I did that\u201d (Schmidhuber, 2006). Resolving this uncertainty is exactly the intrinsic motivation or epistemic value associated with exploration of one\u2019s own motor capacities (Saegusa, Metta, Sandini, & Sakka, 2009). As we discuss below, these considerations link PP to infants\u2019 curiosity and exploration (i.e., choosing actions that afford the \u201copportunity for prediction error\u201d), which is conceptually related to the notion of proximal development (Vygotsky, 1978). At this stage, it is sufficient to note that PP under active inference renders novelty seeking and responding to epistemic affordance a natural part of the way we forage for information in the service of self-modeling (and self-evidencing). These considerations closely correspond to the notion that young infants not only learn to move but also move to learn (e.g., Adolph, 2008).",

Thus, the main purpose of processing sensory information is not the mere representation of the external world but the generation of appropriate behavioral responses by making inferences on the consequences of behavioral responses for sensory inputs (sensorimotor contingency perspective; Engel, Maye, Kurthen, & K\u00f6nig, 2013; O\u2019Regan & No\u00eb, 2001).

            "text": "Infants\u2019 emerging understanding about the physical and social world is commonly investigated by using violation-of-expectation (VOE) paradigms. In VOE paradigms, infants\u2019 orienting response (Sokolov, 1963, 1990) is taken as an indicator of infants\u2019 basic concepts about the environment. Unexpected events that violate physical or social rules lead to differential responses in infants\u2019 gaze behavior (e.g., Wynn, 1992), pupil dilation (Gredeb\u00e4ck & Melinder, 2010), and event-related brain responses (Berger, Tzur, & Posner, 2006; K\u00f6ster, Langeloh, & Hoehl, 2019; Langeloh et al., 2018; Reid et al., 2009). For example, infants detect impossible physical events (e.g., a ball rolling through a wall; Spelke, Breinlinger, Macomber, & Jacobson, 1992), changes in numbers (e.g., changes in the number of toys behind an occluder; Simon, Hespos, & Rochat, 1995; Wynn, 1992), or irrational human actions (e.g., a pretzel that is put toward the ear instead of the mouth; Reid et al., 2009). The PP perspective offers a plausible explanation for infants\u2019 VOE responses across social and physical knowledge domains. VOE responses indicate infants\u2019 processing of prediction errors, which require them to refine prior predictions (i.e., update their predictive models) or, put more simply, learning. It was formerly emphasized that unexpected events provide infants with novel opportunities to learn (Baillargeon, 2004; Leslie, 2004; Stahl & Feigenson, 2019). In support of this view, a recent study of 11-month-old infants demonstrated an increase in subsequent exploration and hypothesis-testing behavior by the infants for objects that behaved in an unexpected way (Stahl & Feigenson, 2015). Thus, infants actively seek to reduce their uncertainties, which may be particularly important for objects that do not comply with their existing predictive models.",

This idea has intriguing implications for infants\u2019 motivation to explore and learn from their environment and likewise for their preference for behavioral regularities. From a PP perspective, the motivation to learn, to reduce prediction errors, may be a self-sufficient process that explains infants\u2019 curiosity (i.e., their intrinsic motivation to explore; Twomey & Westermann, 2018) and interest in novel objects, events, and activities (Stahl & Feigenson, 2019; see also the section on infants\u2019 motor learning and proprioception). The emphasis is on building up and optimizing internal models (i.e., the importance of novelty seeking and the epistemic value in early exploratory behavior). In this instance, exactly the same principles that underlie motor exploration may also drive infants\u2019 general exploratory tendencies\u2014resolving uncertainty about the way that the world works (see also Kayhan & Kwisthout, 2017, p. 10).",

            "text": "For young infants, interacting with social agents in particular comes with many uncertainties given that the thoughts and intentions of other individuals are largely hidden and people often act differently in similar situations (FeldmanHall & Shenhav, 2019). FeldmanHall and Shenhav (2019) argued that specific strategies have evolved to improve predictions in a social context, including impression formation and perspective taking. Furthermore, Bayesian models of social learning, including epistemic trust and imitation, take advantage of the fact that probabilistic models enable the integration of multiple kinds of data (i.e., statistical and social information; e.g., Gopnik & Bonawitz, 2015; Rao et al., 2007; Shafto & Goodman, 2008). We would like to add to these considerations that human social norms, behavioral codes within social groups that regulate human social interactions, may have evolved, to some extent, to reduce uncertainties in the social world (for a similar argument, see Veissi\u00e8re, Constant, Ramstead, Friston, & Kirmayer, 2019). From early on, infants seek to understand (K\u00f6ster & Hepach, 2019), comply with (Haun, Rekers, & Tomasello, 2014), and enforce social norms (Rakoczy & Schmidt, 2013). In a similar vein, it has been argued that social learning, resulting in decreased prediction errors in complex social exchanges, may thus be inherently rewarding and, at the same time, help others to reduce their prediction errors (de Bruin & Michael, 2018). Thus, a PP perspective has theoretical implications for infants\u2019 motivation to learn about their complex social environments and their preference for structured environments.",

Colombo and Wright (2017) argued that the brain is a complex interplay between multiple systems, which renders any grand unifying hypothesis unjustified. Instead, neuroscientific progress is suggested to rely on experimental and theoretical work trying to answer different smaller questions simultaneously. Another major criticism of the PP framework regards its testability. For example, Kogo and Trengove (2015) have argued that the PP framework does not specify how the more fine-grained neuronal mechanisms underlying the basic computational principles, such as error computation and minimization, are implemented in the neurophysiology of the brain.",

This idea corresponds closely to a cornerstone of Bayesian learning: Each time new evidence is received, the prior (predictive model) is updated to a new posterior (adjusted model), which becomes a new prior for making inferences when next evidence is observed. To give an example: Priors of the visual environment in relation to the body are updated when the infant learns to stand up or is put in a walker. The adjusted models then help the infant navigate the environment when moving on two feet (Dahl et al., 2013). Furthermore, according to Oakes and Rakison (2019), developmental cascades originate in the structure and development of the nervous system. This notion is highly interesting regarding the hierarchical structure proposed by the PP framework. Predictive models are formed at each level of the hierarchy and in different domains, and the interplay between different levels and domains is not well understood. For example, many physical and social concepts emerge before infants can put them into words (e,g, Bergelson & Swingley, 2012) or action (e.g., K\u00f6ster, Itakura, Omori, & K\u00e4rtner, 2019; see also K\u00f6ster & K\u00e4rtner, 2019), which suggests that these cognitive capacities develop independently from specific motor abilities. For future research, it will be intriguing to understand the development at different levels of the hierarchy and interdependency between different hierarchical levels.",

How do infants use prediction errors to update predictive models? Which are the neural markers of the formation and refinement of predictive models in the infant brain? Which are the optimal learning conditions, and how big should prediction errors be to facilitate the updating of internal models? How do these computational foundations interact with basic human needs and motives?

For a better understanding of PP in the infant brain, it will be crucial to much better understand basic computational principles of PP at early developmental stages and show their implications for developmental trajectories across several domains of infant learning.
