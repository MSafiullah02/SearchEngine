As a research and political field, it is focused on improving the quality of life of the population by identifying, suggesting, and applying prevention measures (eg, through the promotion of healthy behaviors) and health-related treatments [2]. Monitoring health is one important contribution to public health measures and involves the systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of large amounts of health-related data. The key aim of public health surveillance is to design and guide interventions; in particular, (1) it serves as an early warning system for health emergencies (epidemics, ie, acute events), (2) it documents public health interventions and tracks their progress (ie, monitoring health), and (3) it monitors and clarifies the epidemiology of health problems, enabling the prioritization of information necessary for the formulation of health policy (ie, targeting chronic events) [3].",

            "text": "In the past, surveillance has been based on reports from health care workers constituting an active surveillance system when consistent and standardized reporting is in place [3,4]. However, this architecture is costly to maintain and involves significant delays between the moment of data capture to the time point of the first diagnosis, thus hampering any rapid or even immediate detection of outbreaks [5]. Instead of attempting to gather surveillance data from a network of health facilities and laboratories, health entities can employ a passive surveillance system in which hospitals, clinics, or other similar sources submit their respective health reports. This system provides an inexpensive way to monitor the community\u2019s health; however, data quality is an issue owing to nonuniform reporting standards, and timeliness remains difficult to achieve [4]. To further complement these systems, syndromic surveillance was created to deal with the timeliness issue by using clinical (eg, emergency department admissions) and nonclinical sources (eg, over-the-counter drug sales), which are available before a diagnosis is confirmed [4]. This type of surveillance is based on the assumption that an outbreak would manifest itself as an anomaly in normal behavior [5]. In line with syndromic surveillance and with the growth of the internet, new opportunities for the detection of health-related information have arisen, with the potential to capture the patient\u2019s input directly from the source. This leads to the ambitious endeavor of being able to monitor the health of a significant portion of the population at any point in time and at any geographical location, with the ultimate goal of monitoring public health.",

Data analytics based on these data sources can provide near real-time outbreak information in various formats (independently from official governmental output) and have been successfully tested for health-related purposes. Furthermore, these sources offer the unique advantage of providing firsthand evidence for occurrences of health-related events (eg, through social media channels) and real-time informal reports (eg, news), which can be immediately investigated. Any analysis can be focused only on continuous monitoring, or by contrast to the identification of specific events (ie, single disease focus). In the latter case, it can be targeted to identify isolated hints (eg, mentions of flu) or to determine significant changes in public reporting; it can be further extended to consider the location of the population at risk or to monitor the distribution or extension of an epidemic (eg, influenced by the travelling population). The potential of data analytics applied to public data for health-related developments is ever more far-reaching in our increasingly digitally equipped society; thus, these approaches have an important role in the improvement of timeliness and sensitivity (ie, rapidly and correctly identifying health mentions) in public health surveillance [7].",

Furthermore, these diseases are continuously monitored by official sources through laboratory tests or sentinel systems over many years and such information now forms the ground-truth data used to validate the findings from IBSs [11].",

            "text": "ProMED-mail is one of the first applications of such sources. This system is currently used for communication, via email and reports, among the infectious disease community [12]. Other systems include aggregators such as Global Public Health Intelligence Network, BioCaster, and HealthMap. These initially targeted a variety of sources including emails, Really Simple Syndication feeds, and PDF documents to extract information referring to an increased number of clusters of infected people at a specified time, period, or location, which could indicate a threat. The aggregator systems still in operation also include additional sources such as social media [7,13]. Moving to other sources, influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) served as a prototypical case study owing to being seasonal, worldwide, and well-reported diseases and initiated the monitoring of web-based queries. In particular, one of the first studies utilized Google search volumes to estimate the percentage of ILI-related physician visits [14]. This source was further adapted to the surveillance of other diseases such as dengue [15], gastroenteritis, and chickenpox [16]. This initial success led Google to develop targeted tools for the monitoring of influenza (Google Flu Trends) and dengue (Google Dengue Trends) in 2008 and 2011, respectively, which were later discontinued. Research continued and aimed to identify the most appropriate search terms to utilize as well as other search services (eg, Yahoo [17]) and other languages (eg, V\u00e5rdguiden [18]). Following search queries, microblogs, in particular, Twitter, showed to be another source of health information characterized by providing more descriptive information and potentially containing semistructured metadata (eg, location and gender) [19,20]. By filtering messages containing disease-related keywords, the frequency of disease mentions can be tracked and outbreaks can be identified as unusual spikes in the message frequency [21]. Similar to search queries, subsequent research focused on the identification of adequate keywords, as well as the identification of personal health messages, ie, containing a keyword relevant to the disease and describing a first-person infection case, among others [22,23]. With the use of more descriptive albeit semantically ambiguous data, the focus shifted to detecting true signals, ie, first-person occurrences of diseases. The application of IBSs continued to grow [24] in tandem with the addition of new sources such as Facebook [25], Instagram [26], and discussion forums [27]. Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are the cause of 71% of deaths globally, ranging from 37% in low-income countries to 88% in high-income countries, hence, internet-based surveillance focus has begun to also include NCDs [10]. In this case, emphasis was given to the online behavior of affected individuals, as well as to the content of the information present in the sources [28], with the goal to establish or improve health practices and support the dissemination of health information to address the needs of the population [29,30].",

Subsequent automatic use of these methods then becomes the key step to monitor the internet sources continuously, and eventually to identify potential public health risks or, even better, risks to individual patients [31]. However, disease surveillance based on online sources must be used with caution. Automatic identification of disease events from web-based data streams has to cope with inherent biases, ie, false-positive events, introduced through geographic or cultural variability in language and reporting when compared with reliable traditional surveillance methods [32]. Furthermore, traditional epidemiological parameters (eg, attack rate) are often not available as a gold standard and thus limit the proper assessment of the applied methods [31].",

In total, the literature search had a duration of 2 months, excluding the screening and eligibility steps. Our review focused on the literature published after 2012 to cover a wider variety of sources, given the time lag between their popularity peaks; furthermore, by analyzing the literature published a few years after the first studies (eg, 2009 for search queries [14] and 2010 for social media [19]), we focused on research with finer-grained and adapted methodologies (eg, improved keyword selection and relevancy filters). To select relevant articles, a multiphase process was implemented. First, the article title was screened for relevance and duplicates were removed; subsequently the abstract was screened, and only articles that passed both steps were considered for the eligibility phase. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the articles were decided according to a modified PICOTS. The criteria are specified in Multimedia Appendix 1. The first author performed the screening process and retrieved the data. When doubts were raised regarding the inclusion of certain publications, the remaining authors were consulted.",

This step was performed using the NVivo version 11 qualitative software database (QSR International Pty Ltd), nested cases were used to annotate each item of the extraction form. The extraction guidelines are available in Multimedia Appendix 1. For each checklist item in the guidelines, we created a classification that has been detailed in the following sections. Each paper was classified as journal or conference, in accordance with the inclusion criteria. Regarding the targeted diseases, we divided this into chronic, infectious, medical conditions, and health topics. The first three categories have been further specified. For the Goal/Objective item, a paper was classified as outbreak forecasting if it explicitly stated that the research was aimed at forecasting; else, it was assigned to surveillance (ie, when the purpose is only to identify the degree of correlation with ground-truth data and there is no mention of forecasting); disease characterisation was assigned when the aim was to determine identifiable characteristics related to a disease, eg, patient search behavior and commonly mentioned treatments, or when the aim was to classify a text as related to a disease; content analysis was assigned to the study of the sources\u2019 content (eg, news presence and expressed sentiment) referring to a disease or medical condition; personal health mention classification focused on separating general mentions of a disease or medical conditions (eg, news) from first-person mentions; and diagnosis prediction was assigned when the purpose was to attribute a disease or medical condition to a text and its creator by proxy. The Internet-based data source can be classified into search queries, social media (including microblogs), websites, news, discussion forums, web encyclopedia, and media monitoring systems. We also considered the use of data sources external to the IBSs, which can be classified as demographic, socioeconomic, and climate statistics, as well as data from governmental and laboratory sources, among others. To address the study design/methodology, we devised the following criteria: topic analysis corresponds to when topic modelling and similar approaches are used; regression models encompass all regression and autoregression models (eg, linear regression and autoregressive moving average); statistical models was assigned to more complex models (eg, Hidden Markov Chain); correlation analysis was used when correlation scores are calculated (eg, Pearson); rule-based techniques and ranking techniques are self-explanatory; manual analysis was assigned when no specific techniques are used other than a manual assessment; epidemiology theory refers to the use of techniques and measures commonly used in epidemiology (eg, Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered models); linguistic analysis was assigned when sentiment analysis and lexicons, among others, were used; and finally, we split machine learning and deep learning. Finally, we did not add a classification to the findings and limitations; we chose to keep this as an open field and manually analyzed the outcomes.",

We argue that using a worldwide search engine, cultural differences that shape online search behavior could be diluted further complicating the surveillance task. Google Trends and its variations are the most common and widely represented; Bing also has an extensive geographical representation but a lower market share [190]. Also included are Baidu, Naver, Yandex, V\u00e5rdguiden and Webs\u00f6k, and Sapo, which cater to different countries, namely China, South Korea, Russia, Sweden, and Portugal, respectively. Nonetheless, the use of country-specific search engines can be limited by their market share, as is the case for Sapo [191], and their fine-grained geographical representation, eg, V\u00e5rdguiden is mostly used by people in Stockholm [68].

With regard to search queries, a variety has been used to provide the most representative search behavior for the countries and languages targeted. A similar methodology was applied with social media, although mostly restricted to microblogs. Another important task in studying communicable illnesses is to explore what type of information is being shared and when; this is vital to identify the spread of misinformation and to analyze how far-reaching the counteractions are from health care agencies. Hence, content analysis is also performed by mainly utilizing social media as it provides more contextual information than search queries. Forums and news are utilized for the same reason; the higher contextual value allows for more insights into the study of information dissemination.",

Collecting epidemiological data for NCDs is a labor-intensive process [57,196]; hence, monitoring through digital sources aims primarily to estimate the number of affected individuals, given that official statistics are released with a significant delay [47,57,58,95,136]. To perform such a task, the commonly used sources are social media, search queries, and online obituaries. Content analysis focuses on determining the behavior and characteristics of users who actively mention a disease (eg, through a forum or social media), and the content and dissemination of health information. This is relevant as it allows to explore the information that is spread within these communities, such as personal medical advice. Additionally, past research has shown that online communities can provide a more convenient environment, for some patients, than traditional face-to-face interactions with health providers [36,41,43,82]. For content analysis, the sources applied are social media, forums, and web encyclopedia. As stated earlier, data with greater contextual content could provide more detailed information regarding online behavior and information exchange. With regard to forecasting, Gu et al [95] and Zhang et al [138] mention the task of predicting erythromelalgia-related hospital visits one week ahead and detecting early signals of diabetes, both through the use of search query data.",

Regarding the remaining health topics, the population affected does not fluctuate as is the case with infectious diseases; hence, the focus is on the discussion that occurs online.

In all the sources, common limitations refer to the lack of representativeness and bias caused by internet penetration and access, and preference to certain user age groups. For example, in the case of Twitter, 62% of its 330 million users are aged between 18 and 49 years [198]; around 53% of American internet users look up information on Wikipedia, with these users being mostly highly educated (69%) and under the age of 30 years (62%) [199].

In light of this, we present an interaction schema in Figure 4; the sources of public health\u2013related data predominantly comprise search engine queries, which target public sources, and peer-to-peer (P2P) social media networks; we can further distinguish primary consumers of health information, eg, members of P2P networks, from producers, eg, biased and unbiased news and unbiased official data providers (eg, governmental sources).

Future approaches must focus on the ever-changing nature of diseases. For example, new related keywords could be identified through services such as Google Trends\u2019 related topics.
