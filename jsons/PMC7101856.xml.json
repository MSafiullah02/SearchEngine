The major metabolic flux of long-chain fatty acids is through the beta-oxidation system of the mitochondria present in all cells except the mature erythrocyte (Kunau et al 1995). Long chain fatty acids act as an important source of respiratory fuel for many tissues especially skeletal and cardiac muscle. The brain is generally dependent on glucose for energy production and the \u201cglucose sparing\u201d effect of ketones during short term fasting is particularly important in infants. However in keto-adapted individuals the brain switches to utilise ketone bodies as its major energy source (Phinney 1983a).",

Long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase LCAD and the MTP complex are expressed in human lung (Oey et al 2005). Surfactant abnormalities and mitochondrial dysfunction are two potential mechanisms by which MTP/LCHAD defects might predispose to ARDS. Accumulating fatty acid metabolites in patients with LCHAD/MTP defects might well alter the phospholipid components of surfactant and impair its function. A single case of respiratory distress has been linked to LCAD deficiency (Suhrie et al 2011). This might suggest a role for LCAD and MTP protein in substrate modification for the production of surfactant which contains several lipid components including palmitoylmyristoylphosphatidylcholine (Bernhard et al 2001; Ridsdale et al 2005). Synthesis of myristic acid would imply a need for fatty acid chain shortening.",

Even patients with the same mutation may present in entirely different ways, e.g. homozygous c.985A > G MCADD presenting as neonatal ketoacidosis with encephalopathy (personal observation), hypoketotic hypoglcaemia in infancy or absence of history of any related clinical disease in adults. The precise mechanisms underlying this diversity remain unclear, although recent advances in our knowledge of multiple gene expression which dictates the metabolome are providing some clues (Homuth et al 2012). Some FAOD\u2019s do show significant genotype/phenotype correlation particularly with regard to the severe, as compared to the milder phenotypes of, e.g. CPT2, very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase VLCAD and multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase MAD deficiency (Bonnefont et al 1996; Andresen et al 1999; Olsen et al 2003) see Table 3. However in many disorders there is a much poorer or virtually absent correlation, e.g. MCADD, CTD. Certainly there are many factors that are known to influence the phenotype such as frequency and duration of fasting, intercurrent infections, type of energy substrate, e.g. fat vs. carbohydrate, the extent and duration of exercise, exposure to certain drugs and protection by anti-oxidants and co-factors (Lucas et al 2011). However we still remain unable to explain why for example even relatively well controlled LCHADD (homozygous c.1528G > C) patients exhibit significant morbidity, develop chorioretinopathy and often neuropathy while a few reach adulthood with minimal retinal changes as the only manifestation of clinical disease (den Boer et al 2002; Olpin et al 2005).\n\n",

There is phenotypic variability in this disorder, many patients present during the first few years of life either with symptomatic cardiomyopathy and/or with repeated hypoketotic hypoglycaemia (Reye-like episodes). Some infants may present initially with relatively mild symptoms of muscle hypotonia, mild developmental delay, failure to thrive, delayed walking, repeated infections and poor growth. Other patients may present much later in childhood (4\u201312 years) with isolated cardiomyopathy which can present as sudden death. Occasionally older subjects have been described with mild ventricular fibrillation or adult onset lipid storage myopathy (Rijlaarsdam et al 2004; Vielhaber et al 2004). Both silent and symptomatic individuals have been described within the same pedigree (Spiekerkoetter et al 2003a) and asymptomatic adults are now well described (Vijay et al 2006). There is evidence to suggest that asymptomatic patients tend to have slightly higher residual carnitine transporter activity than clinically presenting patients (Rose et al 2011).",

There are three genes in the human genome that are known to encode related carnitine acyltransferases: CPT1A encodes the liver isoform of CPT1, CPT1B encodes muscle-type CPT1 and CPT1C, encoding CPT1 related protein expressed in brain (Price et al 2002). CPT1A is expressed in liver, kidney, lung, spleen, intestine, pancreas, ovary and fibroblasts. Only liver-type CPT1A deficiency has been recognised so far (Demaugre et al 1988; Falik-Borenstein et al 1992; Haworth et al 1992; Bergman et al 1994; Olpin et al 2001). Deficiency of CPT1A prevents the formation of long-chain acylcarnitines and the absence of these species, which are potent inhibitors of renal tubular free carnitine transport, results in a higher renal threshold for free carnitine (Stanley et al 1991). Patients often have characteristically high total plasma carnitine concentrations with more than 90 % in the free form. Patients with CPT1 deficiency usually present in infancy with recurrent episodes of hypoketotic hypoglycaemic, metabolic acidosis with raised transaminases, hepatomegaly, hepatosteatosis and mild to moderate hyperammonemia. Cholestatic jaundice has recently been described (Morris et al 2013). Acute fatty liver of pregnancy AFLP has also been reported in an Inuit female (Innes et al 2000). Death may occur during an acute presentation but surviving infants may suffer with severe developmental delay and intellectual impairment as a result of cerebral bioenergetic failure.",

Expression of CPT1A in fetal myocardium with persistence of expression into the neonatal period is proposed as an explanation (Weis et al 1994). Renal tubular acidosis has also been reported in a number of patients and this is explained by the expression of CPT1A in renal tubular epithelium with reliance on fat oxidation to power the high energy transport processes. Renal tubular acidosis appears to respond to medium chain triglyceride MCT supplementation but not to a low fat diet per se (Falik-Borenstein et al 1992; Olpin et al 2001). Hyperlipidaemia with raised triglycerides and/or cholesterol is also a feature of CPT1 deficiency, although hyperlipidaemia is rarely reported in other fat oxidation disorders (Falik-Borenstein et al 1992; Olpin et al 2001). The nature of a block on the outer mitochondrial membrane may specifically favour hepatic very low density lipoprotein synthesis with resultant hyperlipidaemia. Clinical presentation is explained primarily by lack of energy production from long chain fatty acids but with metabolic disturbance confined to the tissues where CPT1A is expressed.",

Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is a clinically heterogeneous disease, and as with CPT2 deficiency there are three major phenotypes: a late onset myopathic form, a milder childhood form, usually with hypoketotic hypoglycaemia as the main presenting feature but often with exercise intolerance and rhabdomyolysis as a significant feature particularly in older children and young adults. There is also a severe infantile form, with early onset non-ketotic hypoglycaemia, high mortality, and high incidence of cardiomyopathy. However unlike the fatal neonatal-onset form of severe CPT2 deficiency where developmental abnormalities are often present (see Table 3), these are not reported in severe neonatal VLCADD. It is hypothesised that in fetal tissues the role of VLCADD is replaced by other ACAD\u2019s thus permitting normal in utero development (He et al 2011). Overall VLCADD is one of the commonest fatty acid oxidation disorders that we encounter, second only to MCADD (Fig. 2). There is a good genotype/phenotype correlation between severe infantile disease and milder phenotypes (Andresen et al 1999).\n",

During the first 5 to 10 min of moderate exercise, high-energy phosphates are used but as these become depleted there is a switch to muscle glycogen. As the duration of moderate exercise increases both glucose and at first muscle triglycerides are used, but after approximately one hour, free fatty acids become increasingly important as the major fuel for muscle (Essen et al 1977). There is evidence that children and adolescents rely more heavily on fat metabolism during aerobic exercise than adults (Boisseau and Delmarche 2000). Thus milder defects of fat oxidation that may sustain energy production in tissues when demand on fatty acid oxidation is relatively low become rate limiting when demand is high (Orngreen et al 2004, 2005).",

Together these two disorders represent the most common inherited metabolic causes of myalgia and rhabdomyolysis in children and adults. Clinically presenting cases of CPT2 are more common in males although the explanation that this is solely related to frequency and duration of aerobic exercise is debatable. A number of cases of myopathic VLCADD have a past history of isolated episodes of hypoglycaemia in infancy/early childhood and this is in contrast to myopathic CPT2 patients where hypoglycaemia in infancy/early childhood is very rarely reported. Some myopathic VLCADD patients appear to develop very poor exercise tolerance following clinical presentation as an adolescent/adult, although previously reporting relatively good exercise tolerance in childhood/early adolescence (personal observation).",

There is a progressive peripheral polyneuropathy from infancy or early childhood affecting predominantly the lower limbs, but also symmetric weakness in wrist and finger extensors. There may be exercise intolerance, gait abnormalities with bilateral Achilles tendon contractures, planovalgus deformities and loss of vibrational sense. Some patients may develop respiratory failure often in association with an acute decompensation. Nerve conduction studies and sural nerve biopsy frequently show evidence of axonal degeneration and loss of normal myelin (Spiekerkoetter et al 2004a). There may be pigmentary retinopathy. Episodic rhabdomyolysis in association with exercise, illness or fasting, is usually encountered in this condition but this may not appear until many years after the initial neurological presentation (Spiekerkoetter et al 2004a, Olpin et al 2005). It has been proposed that the neuropathy and rhabdomyolysis seen in mild trifunctional protein deficiency is due to the specific toxic nature of the 3-hydroxacyl metabolites (Ibdah et al 1998; Schaefer et al 1996; Spiekerkoetter et al 2003b).",

            "text": "However a sub-set of MADD patients have been recently characterised who respond to pharmacological doses of riboflavin both clinically and biochemically (RR-MADD). These RR-MADD patients for the most part have been shown to have mutations in ETFQO and most mutations are situated around the ubiquinone binding pocket. (Olsen et al 2007; Gempel et al 2007). Riboflavin is the precursor of FAD, and riboflavin responsiveness results from the ability of FAD to act as a chemical chaperone that promotes folding of certain misfolded ETF-QO proteins, and thereby ameliorate or normalise disease symptoms (Cornelius et al 2012). Patients may present with cyclical vomiting, loss of appetite, progressive proximal muscle weakness particularly affecting neck, shoulder, hip and/or respiratory muscles but also chronic leg weakness and exercise intolerance with occasional rhabdomyolysis. Some patients may present with acute encephalopathy. There is also frequently an associated muscle ubiquinone deficiency with low respiratory chain complexes I, II/III and IV (Olsen et al 2007; Gempel et al 2007). The clinical response to pharmacological doses of riboflavin is usually rapid and striking. Most patients present as adolescents or young adults with an increased female: male ratio. Riboflavin intake in many diets often falls below the recommended daily intake and this may be particularly true for adolescent females (Gregory and Lowe 2000). RR-MADD may be considered as an example of the interaction of micronutrient availability and genetic predisposition.",

            "text": "The effect of increased temperature on fibroblast fatty acid oxidation flux can be demonstrated in both mild CPT2 (Fig. 4) and VLCAD deficiency (Olpin et al 2012). Several thermolabile CPT2 mutant SNP variants including [p. Phe352Cys] p. Val368Ile (V368l) has been recently described in the Japanese and Chinese population and shown to confer high susceptibility to influenza associated encephalopathy (IEA), low blood ATP and predisposition to brain vascular invasion by virus (Chen et al 2005; Kubota et al 2012; Yao et al 2011; Mak et al 2011). Treating fibroblasts with bezafibrate has been shown to upregulate ATP levels and may possibly offer a therapeutic option in patients infected with IEA (Yao et al 2011). The presence of the V368l variant was also reported as being overrepresented in myopathic CPT2 patients in the UK population (Olpin et al 2003). Bezafibrate also upregulates VLCAD mutant mRNA production and restores fat oxidation in VLCAD deficient cell lines (Gobin-Limballe et al 2007). Similarly bezafibrate has been shown to upregulate CPT2 activity in CPT2 deficient cells, both in vitro and in vivo, with improved clinical outcome (Djouadi et al 2005; Bonnefont et al 2010). Resveratrol and its synthetic analogues have been recently shown to offer great potential for the upregulation of mutant protein mediated through PGC-1\u03b1 and SIRT1 pathways (Bastin et al 2011). This unstable nature of mutant protein is by no means confined to these disorders and is a well recognised feature of many mutant proteins (Gregersen et al 2008, 2010a, b; Yao et al 2011; Furuki et al 2006). As previously mentioned over two thirds of mutations are missense mutations many of which will result in unstable folding mutants but with potential for residual enzyme function. Studies using PTC124 and gentamicin have demonstrated the potential for the use of such compounds to promote readthrough and to increase functional activity of nonsense mutations (Tan et al 2011).\n",

Mobilisation of alanine from muscle, and lactate produced, for example from anaerobic glycolysis in the red cell, are the major sources of pyruvate during catabolic stress. The conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate is a crucial step in the process of gluconeogenesis which is mediated through pyruvate carboxylase PC. Acetyl-CoA is the primary activator of this enzyme, which converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate. The equilibrium of the mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase MDH is displaced to favour the reduction of oxaloacetate to malate. ATP is used as a co-substrate for PC and phosphoenoylpuruvate carboxykinase PEPCK. Consequently in defects of fat oxidation this crucial early step of gluconeogenesis is compromised and this also contributes significantly to hypoglycaemia",
