            "text": "Continued reports of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infecting humans have occurred since the identification of this virus in 2012. MERS-CoV is prone to cause endemic disease in the Middle East, with several dozen spillover infections to other continents. It is hypothesized that MERS-CoV originated from bat coronaviruses and that dromedary camels are its natural reservoir. Although gene segments identical to MERS-CoV were sequenced from certain species of bats and one species experimentally shed the virus, it is still unknown whether other bats can transmit the virus. Here, at the molecular level, we found that all purified bat CD26s (bCD26s) from a diverse range of species interact with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV, with equilibrium dissociation constant values ranging from several to hundreds at the micromolar level. Moreover, all bCD26s expressed in this study mediated the entry of pseudotyped MERS-CoV to receptor-expressing cells, indicating the broad potential engagement of bCD26s as MERS-CoV receptors. Further structural analysis indicated that in the bat receptor, compared to the human receptor, substitutions of key residues and their adjacent amino acids leads to decreased binding affinity to the MERS-RBD. These results add more evidence to the existing belief that bats are the original source of MERS-CoV and suggest that bCD26s in many species can mediate the entry of the virus, which has significant implications for the surveillance and control of MERS-CoV infection. IMPORTANCE In this study, we found that bat CD26s (bCD26s) from different species exhibit large diversities, especially in the region responsible for binding to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, they maintain the interaction with MERS-RBD at varied affinities and support the entry of pseudotyped MERS-CoV. These bat receptors polymorphisms seem to confer evolutionary pressure for the adaptation of CD26-binding virus, such as the ancestor of MERS-CoV, and led to the generation of diversified CD26-engaging CoV strains. Thus, our data add more evidence to support that bats are the reservoir of MERS-CoV and similar viruses, as well as further emphasize the necessity to survey MERS-CoV and other CoVs among bats.",

Coronaviruses (CoVs) can be classified into four genera: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-CoVs (7) . Beta-CoVs are further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D) (6) . Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are beta-CoVs but belong to different lineages. MERS-CoV is a lineage C virus, while SARS-CoV is a member of lineage B (8) . SARS-CoV is hypothesized to have originated in bats and then to have infected humans either indirectly through an intermediate host (e.g., palm civets or raccoon dogs) (9) or without an intermediate host (10) . Accumulating data suggest that dromedary camels are the primary reservoir host for MERS-CoV, and multiple independent transmissions seem to have occurred from dromedary camels to humans (11, 12) . Recent studies also indicate the susceptibility of alpacas for natural MERS-CoV infection and suggest that alpacas may be another MERS-CoV animal reservoir (13, 14) . In addition, gene fragments that are identical to MERS-CoV have also been identified in bats from both Saudi Arabia and Africa (15, 16) .",

Cell lines from certain species of bats also support the replication of MERS-CoV (18) . More importantly, Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) support the replication of MERS-CoV, with detectable shedding of the virus in the respiratory and intestinal tracts for up to 9 days (19) . In contrast to domestic animals such as dromedary camels and alpacas, certain species of bats migrate (20) . The characteristics of migration among bats emphasize their roles in transmitting infectious diseases, including CoV-related diseases. Therefore, studying the potential transmission of MERS-CoV among varied species of bats, which are widely distributed around the world, has significant implications for the surveillance and control of MERS-CoV infection. Viral attachment to susceptible cells and related receptor engagement is the initial step of MERS-CoV infection. Spike (S) protein, integrated into the CoV envelope, can be cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits (21) . The S1 subunit is responsible for receptor engagement. The S2 subunit possesses a typical structure of a type I fusion protein and mediates membrane fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes (4, 22, 23) . For MERS-CoV, the C-terminal domain in S1, which is called the MERS receptor binding domain (MERS-RBD), interacts with the human CD26 (hCD26) receptor (also called DPP IV) (24) . The ability of bCD26s from varied species to interact with MERS-RBD would be an indicator of the susceptibility of bats to MERS-CoV infection and, to some extent, suggests the potential of bats for transmitting MERS-CoV.",

However, M. davidii bCD26 displayed the highest binding affinity to MERS-RBD among the tested bat CD26s. Further structural analysis indicated a similar binding mode of MERS-RBD with hCD26 and M. davidii bCD26, emphasizing the possible origin of MERS-CoV from bats. Similar to hCD26, the glycosylation of the residue equivalent to N229 in hCD26 and the hydrophobic core conferred by the \u24233 helix establish the interaction with MERS-RBD. In terms of the 13 key residues in the human receptor responsible for the ligand interaction, there are three substitutions in M. davidii bCD26, namely, V283 versus T288, T290 versus I295, and K331 versus R336. Notably, only the substitution of T290 with its counterpart I295 in hCD26 increased the binding affinity to the ligand. The side chain of T290 in bCD26 is avoided by the hydrophobic interface and led to a shift in H-bond pairs. In contrast, neither V283T nor K331R increased the bat receptor binding to MERS-RBD. Further scrutiny of the binding interface uncovered that the rigid P330 N-terminal to K331 in bat receptor, instead of the flexible G335 in the human receptor, limits the orientation of the extended lysine residue and decreases the interaction. The P330G and K331R substitutions would essentially increase the interaction of M. davidii bCD26 with the viral ligand. This structurally detailed information indicates the varied adaptation of the viral ligand to the bat and human receptors.",
