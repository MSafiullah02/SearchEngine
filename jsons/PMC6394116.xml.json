Burning was followed by cultivation, resulting in a plantation, locally called chacra, that covers a few hectares (M\u00e4ki et al. 2001; Supplementary Data SD1B). After the soil is no longer fertile, the influx of pioneer species into abandoned chacra during the subsequent 5 to 10 years results in early successional forest that locally is called purma (M\u00e4ki et al. 2001; Supplementary Data SD1C). Purma differs dramatically from closed-canopy forest in terms of plant species composition and physical structure (canopy < 10 m tall, dense understory). Closed-canopy lowland forest (hereafter bosque) is characterized by high tree diversity (V\u00e1squez 1997) with a 30-m canopy punctuated by 50-m emergent trees (Supplementary Data SD1D). Chacra and purma typically have clearly defined boundaries and almost always occur adjacent to bosque (Supplementary Data SD1A). New chacras are typically created next to recently abandoned land that will grow into purma, and in proximity to the dwellings of the people that farm the land.",

Each block contained three plots: one in closed-canopy forest (i.e., bosque), one in agriculture (i.e., chacra), and one in secondary forest (i.e., purma). Because of the heterogeneous landscape and idiosyncratic availability of sites for use, the distances among plots within blocks were variable, as were the distances between plots in adjacent blocks (i.e., average distance between plots within blocks was 1.5 km, whereas the average inter-block distance between plots of the same habitat type was 3.6 km). Each plot was 250 m \u00d7 250 m (Supplementary Data SD2) and was sampled for two three-night sessions, one during the dry season and one during the wet season. Sampling effort was constant for all combinations of block, season, and habitat. During the dry season, a different block was selected randomly for sampling each month; the order of sampling remained the same during the wet season to ensure that populations at each plot had the same number of months to recover from removal of individuals during the preceding dry season. On the first night, two interior subplots and two edge subplots were chosen randomly for sampling; on the second night, the remaining four subplots were sampled; and on the third night, two interior and two edge subplots were chosen at random without regard to previous sampling. Each night, three 12 m \u00d7 3 m mist nets were erected in each selected subplot, two at ground level and one in the upper understory, directly above one of the ground nets. This design sampled bats flying up to 6 m above the ground.",

            "text": "This work was conducted as part of an NIH grant to evaluate bats as reservoirs for arboviruses; this required the collection of blood and tissues. Consequently, up to 20 individuals of each species at each plot in each season were sacrificed and prepared as standard museum specimens. The resultant specimens were used as a reference collection to verify species identifications. Specimens were deposited in the Museo de Historia Natural of the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos and in the Natural Science Research Laboratory of Texas Tech University. Individuals of abundant species (primarily Carollia spp.) beyond the first 20 captures were released after identification to species. Before release, each individual was marked by fur trimming to prevent it from being counted more than once in estimates of abundance during a particular season. We followed the systematic recommendations of Simmons (2005) for bat taxa in lowland Amazonia, except for recognizing Carollia benkeithi (Solari and Baker 2006) as distinct from Car. Castanea, Platyrrhinus incarum as distinct from P. helleri (Velazco et al. 2010), Gardnernycteris as a distinct genus from Mimon (Hurtado and Pacheco 2014), and in recognizing Micronycterinae, Glyphonycterinae, and Rhinophyllinae as subfamilies of phyllostomid bats (Baker et al. 2016). Research involving live animals followed the guidelines for the capture, handling, and care of mammals approved by the American Society of Mammalogists (Sikes et al. 2016) and was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Texas Tech University (ACUC# 01084-03).

            "text": "We classified bats into broad foraging guilds (i.e., aerial insectivores, frugivores, gleaning animalivores, high-flying insectivores, nectarivores, sanguinivores) based on published recommendations (Wilson 1973; Gardner 1977; Stevens et al. 2006). We further characterized species as dominant, common, or rare based on relative abundances. A dominant species was one whose relative abundance was greater than that of all other species (in cases where two or more species were equally dominant, those taxa were considered to be co-dominants). A rare species was one whose relative abundance was < 1/S, where S is species richness. All other species (i.e., those not rare or dominant) were considered to be common. These categorizations were applied at two focal scales: plots and treatment categories (defined as the six unique combinations of habitat and season). Because this approach is hierarchical, plot-level descriptions represent characterizations at the \u03b1-scale and descriptions at the level of treatment combinations represent characterizations at the \u03b3-scale. Finally, because bosque represents the native vegetation of lowland Amazonia, we identified rare species from bosque (combining data from wet and dry seasons) and quantified the number of such species (RB) at the \u03b1- or \u03b3-scale in other habitats. In doing so, we considered a species that was only captured in chacra or purma to be rare in bosque.",

            "text": "For each guild, we used a generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM\u2014Venables and Ripley 2002) to quantify the effects of habitat type (bosque versus chacra versus purma), season (wet versus dry), and their interaction on each of seven metrics of biodiversity: species richness (i.e., cumulative number of species), Shannon diversity, Camargo evenness, Berger\u2013Parker dominance, local rarity (i.e., number of species with a relative abundance < 1/S within a plot), bosque rarity (i.e., number of species within a plot that were rare in bosque [based on combined seasons]), and total abundance (i.e., cumulative number of individuals regardless of species). For metrics that differed among habitats based on a GLMM, we conducted a posteriori tests (Tukey test with a Holm-\u0160id\u00e1k adjustment) to identify consistent differences between all possible pairs of habitat (i.e., in the absence of significant habitat \u00d7 season interaction) or pairwise differences between all possible pairs of habitat within each season (i.e., in the presence of a significant H \u00d7 S interaction). Because such a posteriori tests are less powerful than their associated GLMM and are protected in the sense that a posteriori tests were only executed when GLMMs were significant (\u03b1 \u2264 0.05), we considered P \u2264 0.10 as evidence for significant pairwise differences. Each metric, except for total abundance, was expressed as its numbers equivalent to estimate \u201ctrue\u201d biodiversity (Jost 2006). Metrics that are species counts (i.e., richness, rarity) are their own numbers equivalents. This transformation scales dominance so that larger magnitudes of the metric represent lower dominance but higher biodiversity. All GLMMs and associated a posteriori tests were conducted using the R programming environment (R Core Team 2015) and the MASS (Venables and Ripley 2002), nlme (Pinheiro and Bates 2000), or multicomp (Hothorn et al. 2008) libraries. Season was modeled as a repeated measure, habitat was modeled as a between-subject factor, and block was modeled as a random factor to account for natural spatial variation in environmental characteristics. The inclusion of block as a random factor removes spatial variation associated with the distribution of sites through space, effectively accounting for any form (e.g., linear, bimodal) of spatial autocorrelation prior to evaluations of effects of habitat and season on bat biodiversity. Nonetheless, we evaluated spatial autocorrelation for each of our seven metrics of biodiversity separately for each guild and each season using Moran\u2019s I in the ape library in R (Paradis and Schliep 2018). We detected no evidence of spatial autocorrelation in 28 analyses of our response variables (P-values 0.155\u20130.899, mean = 0.601).",

We consider SADs to represent species composition and RADs to represent the structure of taxonomic biodiversity, in that the various metrics of biodiversity describe the shape of the RADs on which they are based (Supplementary Data SD3). Effects of habitat and season on guild composition (i.e., SAD) and structure (i.e., RAD) were evaluated with separate chi-square randomization tests in Ecosim version 7 (Gotelli and Entsminger 2005).

For frugivores, species composition of chacra differed from that of bosque regardless of season (Table 2; Supplementary Data SD5). The relative abundance of Car. perspicillata, the most dominant species in the environs of Iquitos, was 50% greater in chacra than in bosque. In contrast, the relative abundance of the four common and all rare species did not appreciably differ between bosque and chacra. For gleaning animalivores, species composition of chacra differed from that of bosque only in the dry season (Table 3; Supplementary Data SD6). During that season, three species (i.e., Trinycteris nicefori, Phyllostomus hastatus, and Tonatia saurophila) were co-dominant in bosque. In chacra, two of these species (i.e., Tr. nicefori, and To. saurophila) were rare, and one (P. hastatus) more than doubled in relative abundance. Moreover, the common species in bosque during the dry season (i.e., Gl. sylvestris) was rare in chacra during that season. In contrast, two rare species in bosque during the dry season (i.e., Gardnernycteris crenulatum and P. discolor) were common in chacra, even though mean bosque rarity in chacra and bosque were indistinguishable (Supplementary Data SD4). Thus, even if species persist in agricultural lands, their likelihood of interaction with other species in their guild, as well as their contributions to ecosystem function, may have differed greatly at the local scale (i.e., at the plot or treatment level), where the identity and abundances of species were quite distinctive from that in closed-canopy forest.",

Because chacras are typically created near human habitations, the greater abundances of bats in chacra and purma may represent increased risk of transmission of diseases to humans, especially diseases carried by species (e.g., Car. perspicillata) that exhibit dramatic responses to these human activities. Although outbreaks of zoonoses related to hyperabundant mammalian vectors or reservoirs have not been reported for disturbed habitats of the Iquitos region, zoonoses have been recorded from Car. perspicillata in the Neotropics, including Bartonella spp. in Costa Rica (Judson et al. 2015) and Guatemala (Bai et al. 2011), rabies in Brazil (Fernandes de Almeida et al. 2011), coronaviruses in Mexico (Anthony et al. 2013), Leishmania chagasi in Venezuela (De Lima et al. 2008), and Trypanosoma spp. (including T. cruzi) in Colombia (Ram\u00edrez et al. 2014). Moreover, zoonotic outbreaks have occurred in other regions in similar circumstances. For example, habitat conversion in the United States has increased risk of Lyme disease for humans due to increased abundances of its most competent reservoir (Peromyscus leucopus\u2014Allan et al. 2003). Similarly, habitat loss in rural regions of Bangladesh has resulted in more bats roosting in buildings of small villages. This increase in proximity of bats and humans has led to outbreaks of Nipah virus, which is transmitted by the bats, in those rural human populations (Hahn et al. 2014).",

At the scale of plots, these differences manifested as greater mean abundance, dominance (lower hill number), and local rarity in chacra compared to bosque (Fig. 2; Supplementary Data SD4). Moreover, at the \u03b3-level (treatment combinations; Fig. 3), chacra supported greater bosque rarity (i.e., RB wet = 19; RB dry = 19) than did bosque itself (i.e., RB wet = 14; RB dry = 14).",

This is true because bats constitute an appreciable portion of mammalian diversity in the Neotropics (Kaufman 1995; Meserve 2007), are locally abundant throughout much of the Neotropics, and contribute significantly to multiple ecosystem functions, such as seed dispersal, flower pollination, and arthropod control (Muscarella and Fleming 2007; Novoa et al. 2011; Maas et al. 2016; Williams-Guillen et al. 2016), which ultimately enhance ecosystem services. Moreover, forest regeneration resulting in greater amounts of secondary forest is among the most dominant forms of land use change in the tropics (Asner et al. 2009; Dent and Wright 2009). Nonetheless, considerable variability at the population-, guild-, and assemblage-level characterizes the responses of bats to agriculture and successional forests (Avila-Cabadilla et al. 2012; Meyer et al. 2016). In part, that variability is likely related to the different landscape contexts (e.g., forest area, composition, and configuration) in which conversion and succession occur, as well as to the nature and history of the dominant agricultural practices in the area.",

The extent to which this is true would likely diminish as total area of closed-canopy forest decreases, the extent to which abandonment of agricultural plots and secondary succession are reduced and impaired, respectively, and the intensity of and total area devoted to agriculture increases. Nonetheless, it is clear that even in areas with limited habitat conversion and fragmentation, species composition and some aspects of taxonomic biodiversity (e.g., evenness, diversity, dominance) do change significantly in response to agricultural conversion and remain statistically different from closed-canopy forest, even in successional forest. Thus, the effective contribution of bats to ecosystem function may change to the extent that the frequency and intensity of species interactions in the mosaic of habitats in an area are related to abundance-weighted aspects of biodiversity. The consequences of such changes to ecosystem services remain an important challenge that should receive higher priority in conservation action (Lacher et al., In press). Indeed, the optimal composition and configuration of habitats in \u201cworking landscapes\u201d or ones with mixed use, including land uses dominated by human activities, should receive increasing attention in a world where socioecological systems are becoming the norm (Chazdon 2014).",
