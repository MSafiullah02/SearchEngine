            "text": "The regulation of cell death during a viral infection is an important determinant in the struggle between virus and host for survival. Two forms of cell death have been extensively described, one is necrosis, defined as a passive and non\u2010physiological type of death caused by accidental and acute damage to the cell, and the other is apoptosis, defined as an active and genetically regulated process of cell suicide by which an organism eliminates senescent, abnormal and potentially harmful cells. These two forms of cell death are distinguishable by their morphological and biochemical effects on the cell. However, recent studies have shown that necrosis is also highly regulated and can play essential roles in maintaining homeostasis in healthy cells as well as in the elimination of infectious pathogens (Assuncao Guimaraes and Linden, 2004; Nelson and White, 2004; Festjens et al., 2006; Zong and Thompson, 2006).",

Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped, single\u2010, positive\u2010stranded RNA viruses with very large genomic size of \u223c30 kb and have been known to infect many animal species as well as humans (Siddell, 1995). One of the most common abnormalities in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected patients is lymphopenia (Peiris et al., 2003; Chng et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006), which could be caused by the depletion of T lymphocytes by apoptosis. Indeed, several laboratories have successfully detected SARS\u2010CoV in the lymphocytes isolated from infected patients, suggesting that the virus can infect lymphocytes (Wang et al., 2004; Gu et al., 2005). However, there is still no evidence that infection of lymphocytes is the direct cause for lymphopenia in SARS patients. In addition, both apoptosis and necrosis have been observed in various infected tissues obtained during autopsy studies on SARS casualties (Ding et al., 2003; Lang et al., 2003; Chau et al., 2004; Chong et al., 2004; Wei et al., 2007). Thus, cell death has been observed during SARS\u2010CoV infection in vivo.",

Histopathological examinations revealed extensive damages to the alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages, and these are likely to be caused by multiple factors, including cytopathic effects mediated by replication of the SARS\u2010CoV and the overproduction of immune mediators (see a recent review by Chen and Subbarao, 2007). Besides lymphopenia (as described above), there is currently a lack of information on the role of cell death during the earlier stages of infection, as most of these data were obtained during autopsy studies on fatal cases and would therefore reflect the terminal stages of the disease. Extra\u2010pulmonary spreading of the virus has also been reported, and in some of these organs, apoptosis and necrosis have been observed. In one study, extensive apoptosis was observed in the hepatocytes of three SARS patients who had liver impairment, suggesting that liver damages in these patients may be mediated by apoptosis (Chau et al., 2004). Apoptosis was also observed in the thyroid glands obtained from five fatal SARS cases, suggesting that pathogenesis in the thyroid glands may be related to apoptosis induction (Wei et al., 2007). In various studies, necrosis was also observed in lymphoid tissues and lymph nodes (Ding et al., 2003; Lang et al., 2003; Gu et al., 2005).",

In these studies, the Vero cell line (or a subclone of Vero known as Vero E6), which is a green monkey kidney cell line that supports SARS\u2010CoV replication and shows extensive cytopathic effects upon infection, was used. The induction of apoptosis was dependent on viral replication and could be inhibited by caspase inhibitors or the overexpression of the pro\u2010survival protein, Bcl\u20102 (Ren et al., 2005; Bordi et al., 2006). Although necrosis was not observed in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected Vero E6 cells (Yan et al., 2004), it has been observed in different tissues obtained from SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected patients (Ding et al., 2003; Lang et al., 2003; Chong et al., 2004). It is not clear whether necrosis in these tissues represented secondary necrosis reflecting the degradative changes that apoptotic cells undergo at the later stages of apoptosis, but at least one SARS\u2010CoV protein [open reading frame (ORF) 3b] has been shown to induce necrosis (Khan et al., 2006).",

Interestingly, necrosis was also observed during infection and could be a more dominant factor for viral\u2010induced cell death, as neither the death of infected cells nor the productive replication of IBV was severely affected by the inhibition of apoptosis by the general caspase inhibitor, z\u2010VAD\u2010FMK. Like the ORF 3b protein of SARS\u2010CoV, the ORF 3b protein of IBV is localized to the nucleus (Shen et al., 2003), although it has not yet been determined whether the latter can induce apoptosis or necrosis. For another human coronavirus, OC43, intracerebral inoculation into mice resulted in acute encephalitis, with neuronal cell death caused by both necrosis and apoptosis (Jacomy et al., 2006). However, infection of MRC\u20105, diploid human fetal lung cells, seems to induce mainly apoptosis (Collins, 2001). Similarly, infection of monocytes/macrophages in vitro by 229E, yet another human coronavirus, caused mainly apoptosis, although a few necrotic cells were also observed (Collins, 2002).",

However, this was only performed in the Vero cell line, and it is not known whether the inhibition of apoptosis will affect SARS\u2010CoV replication in other cell lines or animal models. The regulation of cell death in other cell lines may be dramatically different, as some cell lines supported SARS\u2010CoV replication but, unlike the Vero cell line, displayed minimal cytopathic effects (Gillim\u2010Ross et al., 2004; Kaye et al., 2006). Analysis of host gene transcriptions in various cell lines also revealed significant differences in cellular responses to SARS\u2010CoV infection. For example, Tang et al. (2005) reported that the upregulation of pro\u2010apoptotic genes in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected Huh7 cells, while the opposite was observed in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected intestinal cell lines, Caco\u20102 and CL\u201014 (Cinatl et al., 2004).",

Interestingly, several pathways that promote apoptosis, as well as those that prevent apoptosis, appeared to be modified during SARS\u2010CoV infection, suggesting that the cell death may be regulated differently at different stages of the SARS\u2010CoV life cycle. Similar results were obtained when gene profiling was performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) from healthy donors that were inoculated in vitro with SARS\u2010CoV (Ng et al., 2004). Other studies that used PMBCs isolated from SARS patients also revealed changes in the transcription of many genes involved in cell\u2010death regulation (Reghunathan et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2005; Shao et al., 2006). One interesting gene that was found to be upregulated is lipocalin 2, which belongs to a class of secreted proteins that are thought to trigger apoptosis in immune cells via an unknown cell receptor (Reghunathan et al., 2005). The authors speculated that the upregulation of lipocalin 2 is a host response to limit tissue damage and inflammation and the overexpression of lipocalin 2 could lead to lymphopenia in SARS patients.",

The first two\u2010thirds of the SARS\u2010CoV genome encodes the replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) that are processed to yield 16 non\u2010structural proteins, some of which are responsible for replicating the viral genome and/or generating a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs to express all the other ORFs in the genome (Ziebuhr, 2004). The ORFs for the main structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), are encoded in the remaining portion of the genome, and interspaced between these are the ORFs for eight putative accessory proteins (i.e. ORFs 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b). While the SARS\u2010CoV replicase and structural proteins share some degree of sequence homology with those of other coronaviruses, the accessory proteins do not show significant homology to viral proteins of known coronaviruses (Tan et al., 2006). The overexpression of some of the SARS\u2010CoV proteins could induce apoptosis and/or necrosis, and this is summarized in Table 1.",

As shown in Table 1, the experiments were performed in one or two cell lines (Table 1), and it has not been demonstrated whether the induction of apoptosis by these structural proteins is cell line\u2010specific. It is difficult to compare the apoptosis\u2010inducing capabilities of the structural proteins, as different laboratories have used different cell lines for their investigations. For example, the apoptosis induction by the E protein was demonstrated in Jurkat T cells (Yang et al., 2005), while the apoptosis induction by the N protein was demonstrated in COS\u20101 cells (Surjit et al., 2004) and human pulmonary fibroblast (Zhao et al., 2006). It is also interesting to note that some of the structural viral proteins (E, N and M) induce apoptosis only in the absence of growth factors. This may imply that the induction of apoptosis by these proteins can only occur after the host cells become stressed at later stages of infection. Further studies are required to explore this possibility and define the precise mechanisms for cell\u2010death induction.",

Again, for 3a and 3b, the studies were performed in only one or two cell lines. The overexpression of the 3a protein in Vero E6 (Law et al., 2005) and the overexpression of the 3b protein in both COS\u20107 and Vero E6 cells induce apoptosis (Yuan et al., 2005; Khan et al., 2006). The overexpression of ORF 3b in Vero E6 cells also induces necrosis (Khan et al., 2006). A more extensive range of cell lines, including HeLa, HepG2, A549, 293T, COS\u20107 and Vero E6, was used to demonstrate that the overexpression of 7a can induce apoptosis in cell lines derived from different organs, including lung, kidney and liver (Tan et al., 2004).",

            "text": "The mechanisms for induction of apoptosis by these SARS\u2010CoV proteins are unclear, although in some cases, it could be related to their abilities to interfere with cellular functions, such as blocking cell cycle progression, altering membrane permeability, activating signal transduction pathways, upregulating transcription factors and other regulatory genes (Table 1). These could lead to an imbalance in cellular homeostasis and, consequently, the induction of cell death. The cellular localizations of these SARS\u2010CoV proteins have also been determined experimentally, and it is likely that they exert their pro\u2010apoptotic effects by interacting with host proteins in these cellular compartments (Fig. 1). For example, the SARS\u2010CoV E protein has the ability to modulate the membrane permeability of mammalian cells (Liao et al., 2006) and form cation\u2010selective ion channels in planar lipid bilayers (Wilson et al., 2004). In addition, Yang et al. (2005) showed that the induction of apoptosis by E can be inhibited by the overexpression of Bcl\u2010XL, which is a pro\u2010survival member of the Bcl\u20102 family. As Bcl\u2010XL is known to be a critical inhibitor of mitochondrial damage following apoptotic stimuli (Dejean et al., 2006), it is plausible that E induces apoptosis by perturbing the mitochondrial permeability. However, this has not been demonstrated experimentally. The E proteins of other three coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), IBV and human coronavirus\u2010229E (HCoV\u2010229E), can also form ion channels in lipid bilayers (Wilson et al., 2006). Interestingly, the MHV E protein has also been shown to induce apoptosis (An et al., 1999) and alter membrane permeability (Madan et al., 2005).",

Further investigations revealed that it could inhibit the activity of cyclin\u2013cyclin\u2010dependent kinase complex and block S\u2010phase progression (Surjit et al., 2006). The N protein could also activate the transcription factors, nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u2010\u03baB) and activator protein 1 (AP\u20101) (He et al., 2003; Liao et al., 2005). As these transcription factors regulate a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis (Hess et al., 2004; Perkins and Gilmore, 2006; Tergaonkar, 2006), their activation may be linked to the apoptosis\u2010inducing properties of N. For example, the N protein has been shown to upregulate the expression of cyclooxygenase\u20102 (COX\u20102), probably through the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB (Yan et al., 2006).

The 3a and 7a proteins could also activate NF\u2010\u03baB and JNK, leading to the enhancement of IL\u20108 and RANTES production (Kanzawa et al., 2006). Recently, we also demonstrated that the 7a protein interacts with the pro\u2010survival protein, Bcl\u2010XL, and the overexpression of Bcl\u2010XL prevents 7a\u2010induced apoptosis (Tan et al., 2007).

It was further demonstrated that MHV\u2010A59 infection of 17Cl\u20101 cells activated caspase\u20108, which in turn cleaved Bid, a BH3\u2010domain pro\u2010apoptotic member of the Bcl\u20102 family (Chen and Makino, 2002). The resulting tBid p15 fragment was translocated to the mitochondria, where it induced mitochondrial damage and activation of the caspase cascades. In contrast to these two cell lines, no apoptosis was observed in MHV\u2010A59\u2010 or MHV\u2010JHM\u2010infected DBT cells (a mouse astroytoma cell line) although the cells showed extensive cell fusion and detachment from the plates (An et al., 1999). Curiously, overexpression of the MHV E protein caused apoptosis in DBT cells but not in 17Cl\u20101 cells. The reason for the contrasting responses of these cell lines to MHV infection or expression of the E protein remains to be determined. Similarly, the overexpression of the E protein of SARS\u2010CoV can induce apoptosis, and this can be blocked by the Bcl\u2010XL protein (Yang et al., 2005).",

However, the viral protein may not be an important cell\u2010death regulatory factor during infection. For example, the overexpression of the SARS\u2010CoV 7a protein in Vero cells resulted in apoptosis, but a mutant virus without the 7a/7b gene still induced extensive cytopathic effects in Vero cells, suggesting that 7a does not contribute significantly to viral\u2010induced cell death, at least in this cell culture system (Yount et al., 2005). Also, while the overexpression of the MHV E protein induced apoptosis in DBT cells, the expression of E during MHV infection of DBT cells was not sufficient to induce apoptosis (An et al., 1999). Other mechanisms may be more important for regulating apoptosis during infection and this is described in the next section.",

In these cases, although viral replication in the apoptotic cells is not required per se, viral replication has to take place in the nearby infected cells. For example, infection of cats with a highly virulent strain of FIPV also caused apoptosis in a large number of lymphocytes (Haagmans et al., 1996). However, apoptosis did not result directly from infection, as many of apoptotic cells were not FIPV\u2010antigen positive. Thus, apoptosis in FIPV\u2010infected cats is occurring via an indirect mechanism. Similarly for two human coronaviruses, it is believed that the high level of cytokine secreted from OC43\u2010infected MRC\u20105 cells or 229E\u2010infected monocytes/macrophages may be partially responsible for the induction of apoptosis (Collins, 2001; 2002). Caspase\u2010dependent apoptosis was induced in different cell lines infected with TGEV (Eleouet et al., 1998; Sirinarumitr et al., 1998). Again, many of the apoptotic cells were bystander cells as they were not infected by TGEV (Eleouet et al., 1998). On the other hand, no evidence of apoptosis was observed in the intestinal tissues of TGEV\u2010infected piglets, suggesting that there may be some host factors that can prevent TGEV\u2010induced apoptosis (Kim et al., 2000).",

As for SARS\u2010CoV\u2010induced apoptosis in Vero cells, viral replication is required, but whether apoptosis induction is direct or not has not been established (Ren et al., 2005). However, there is clear evidence for increased production of certain cytokines and chemokines during SARS\u2010CoV infection (see recent reviews by Cameron et al., 2007; Chen and Subbarao, 2007), and this could result in apoptosis via a bystander effect. Another mechanism that is used by MHV to induce apoptosis in rat oligodendrocytes is dependent on the fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes, which led to the activation of the Fas signalling pathway (Liu and Zhang, 2007). In this case, UV\u2010inactivated MHV, which is no longer replicative but retains the ability to bind cell receptors and enter the cell, could trigger apoptosis. SARS\u2010CoV does not appear to induce cell death in this manner, as UV\u2010inactivated SARS\u2010CoV does not induce apoptosis (Ren et al., 2005).",

In terms of cell\u2010death regulation during SARS\u2010CoV, the occurrence of cell death during infection both in vitro and in vivo has been established, and numerous viral factors have been suggested to contribute to the regulation of cell death in infected cells. Although apoptosis and necrosis have been observed in different tissues obtained from SARS patients, the ability of SARS\u2010CoV to induce apoptosis was demonstrated in only one cell line, Vero E6, and was not extensively studied in animal models. Similarly, as summarized in Table 1, many of these studies have investigated the effects of the expression of individual viral proteins on cell death regulation (and other cellular pathways) in a limited number of cell lines; hence it is not clear whether each viral protein can induce cell death in all types of cells. It has also not been determined whether the expressions of these viral proteins are high enough during SARS\u2010CoV infection, and whether they function in the presence of other viral factors present during infection. Given that analysis of host gene transcriptions has suggested that there are significant differences in cellular responses to SARS\u2010CoV infection in different cell typs, it is necessary to carry out future investigations in numerous cell lines that support SARS\u2010CoV replication.",

In order to understand the regulation of cell death during SARS\u2010CoV infection, we urgently need to address whether induction of cell death occurs indirectly via bystander effects or directly via expression of viral proteins, or both. For the latter, there is currently no link between the effects of viral proteins on cellular pathways and the induction of apoptosis. To delineate the precise pathways involved, more experiments, like RNA interference and mutagenesis studies, are required to establish structure\u2013function relationships. When compared with the other coronaviruses that have been studied for many years, future advancement in understanding the SARS\u2010CoV may take considerable more time and effort to achieve because of the lack of a single animal model that reproduces all aspects of the human disease (Subbarao and Roberts, 2006) and requirement for infection studies to be performed in biosafety level 3 or 4 laboratories.",

The availabilities of full\u2010length infectious clones of several coronaviruses and robust animal models provide the essential tools for these future studies.
