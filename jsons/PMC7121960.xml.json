            "text": "Pulmonary surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins, and is synthesized and secreted by alveolar type II epithelial cells and bronchiolar Clara cells. It acts to keep alveoli from collapsing during the expiratory phase of the respiratory cycle. After its secretion, lung surfactant forms a lattice structure on the alveolar surface, known as tubular myelin. Surfactant proteins (SP)-A, B, C and D make up to 10% of the total surfactant. SP-B and SPC are relatively small hydrophobic proteins, and are involved in the reduction of surface-tension at the air-liquid interface. SP-A and SP-D, on the other hand, are large oligomeric, hydrophilic proteins that belong to the collagenous Ca2+-dependent C-type lectin family (known as \u201cCollectins\u201d), and play an important role in host defense and in the recycling and transport of lung surfactant (Awasthi 2010) (Fig. 43.1). In particular, there is increasing evidence that surfactant-associated proteins A and -D (SP-A and SP-D, respectively) contribute to the host defense against inhaled microorganisms (see 10.1007/978-3-7091-1065_24 and 10.1007/978-3-7091-1065_25). Based on their ability to recognize pathogens and to regulate the host defense, SP-A and SP-D have been recently categorized as \u201cSecretory Pathogen Recognition Receptors\u201d. While SP-A and SP-D were first identified in the lung, the expression of these proteins has also been observed at other mucosal surfaces, such as lacrimal glands, gastrointestinal mucosa, genitourinary epithelium and periodontal surfaces. SP-A is the most prominent among four proteins in the pulmonary surfactant-system. The expression of both SP-A and SP-D is complexly regulated on the transcriptional and the chromosomal level. SP-A is a major player in the pulmonary cytokine-network and has been described to act in the pulmonary host defense. This chapter gives an overview on the understanding of role of SP-A and SP-D in for human pulmonary disorders and points out the importance for pathology-orientated research to further elucidate the role of these molecules in adult lung diseases. As an outlook, it will become an issue of pulmonary pathology which might provide promising perspectives for applications in research, diagnosis and therapy (Awasthi 2010).\n",

            "text": "Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) eventually ensues to extensive lung fibrosis when exposure to causative antigen continues. Klebs von den Lungen (KL)-6, a mucin-like glycoprotein and SP-D are elevated in most cases. Correct diagnosis in the early stage is crucial, since chronic summer-type HP can result in a fatal outcome after continuous exposure to the causative antigen (Inase et al. 2007). In pulmonary tissues of collagen vascular disease-associated interstitial pneumonia (CVD-IP) and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), SP-D can be a marker for maturity of regenerating epithelial cells. SP-A along with KL-6 is detected in intimate relationship to the stage of regeneration of alveolar epithelial cells and expressed before SP-D (Ohtsuki et al. 2007). Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is most common complication of radiotherapy for thoracic tumors. Both SP-A and SP-D concentrations in sera from patients with RP were significantly higher than those from patients without RP. Serum SP-A and SP-D may be of diagnostic value for detection of RP, even when radiographic change is faint (Takahashi et al. 2001). Despite the rise of SP-D and KL-6 in serum in adult patients with various types of interstitial pneumonia (IP) and collagen diseases with interstitial pneumonia, KL-6 may be superior in sensitivity of IP, where as SP-D may be more specific for IP than KL-6. Early decrease of SP-D contrasts with the transient increase of KL-6 levels after prednisolone pulse therapy (Arai et al. 2001). High serum KL-6 value is an indicator of ILD of Wilson-Mikity syndrome and better than SP-D and LDH levels (Takami et al. 2003). Thus serum SP-A and SP-D monitoring along with KL-6 is useful indicator for estimating RP (Matsuno et al. 2006).",

The concentrations of SP-A and SP-D in BAL fluids from patients with IPF and IPCD are rather lower than those in healthy controls; and the SP-A/phospholipid ratio may be a useful marker of survival prediction. SP-D-deficient patients have more frequently pneumonias and their long-term outcome is worse than those with detectable SP-D. Among children with recurrent bronchitis and SP-D detectable in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), patients with allergic asthma had threefold levels of SP-D compared with controls. In contrast, SP-D deficiency due to consumption or failure to up-regulate SP-D may be linked to pulmonary morbidity in children (Griese et al. 2008).",

Alterations in serum levels of SP-A may reflect smoking habits since serum SP-A was higher in active smokers than in nonsmokers (Nomori et al. 1998). However, SP-A is not a sensitive discriminating factor to separate smokers from nonsmokers. The contents of SP-A and SP-D in BAL fluids were significantly decreased in smokers compared to those in nonsmokers, although there was no significant difference of total phospholipid content between two groups (Honda et al. 1996). SP-A may decrease due to the cumulative effects of long-term smoking and development of emphysema, while SP-D decreases due to long-term smoking (Betsuyaku et al. 2004; Shijubo et al. 1998). Emphysema can be induced in mice by chronic cigarette smoke exposure with increase of SP-D in emphysema lungs. While accumulation of foamy alveolar macrophages may play a key role in the development of smoking-induced emphysema, increased SP-D may play a protective role in the development of smoking-induced emphysema, in part by preventing alveolar cell death (Hirama et al. 2007).",

Chronic maternal ethanol consumption during the third trimester of pregnancy alters SP-A gene expression in fetal lung. These alterations may underlie increased susceptibility of preterm infants, exposed to ethanol in utero, to RSV and other microbial agents (Lazic et al. 2007). The exposure to moderate and high occupational levels of Diesel exhaust (DE) causes an increase in lung injury and inflammation, and a decrease in host defense molecules, which could result in increased severity of infectious and allergic lung disease. Several inflammatory and immune cytokines are upregulated at various time points and concentrations, in contrast to SP-A and SP-D which were significantly decreased at protein level.

Despite this, SP-A/PL in BAL is a biochemical marker that predicts survival in patients with IPF (McCormack et al. 1995; Phelps et al. 2004).",

Dohmoto et al. (2000) hypothesized that regenerated or premature bronchoepithelial cells may circulate in the blood in patients with IPF. RT-PCR for cytokeratin 19 (CK19) and pulmonary SP-A in peripheral blood in patients with IPF and pulmonary fibrosis (PF) associated with collagen vascular disorders suggests that there were some circulating bronchoepithelial cells expressing mRNA for SP-A in peripheral blood of patients associated with collagen vascular disorders. Thus, both serum SP-A and SP-D levels are highly predictive of survival in patients with IPF (Greene et al. 2002; Takahashi et al. 2006b) and the measurement of SP-D in sera can provide an easily identifiable and useful clinical marker for the diagnosis of IPF, IPCD, and PAP, and can predict the disease activity of IPF and IPCD and the disease severity of PAP (Honda et al. 1995). However, KL-6 is the best serum marker for ILD (Ohnishi et al. 2002). Serum KL-6 and SP-D were also prognostic markers in acute exacerbation of IPF after treatment with Sivelestat (Endo et al. 2006; Nakamura et al. 2007). High levels of SP-D in BAL fluids are associated in patients with PAP, but not with IPF and IPCD.",

One SP-A1 (6A4) allele and SNPs that characterize the 6A4 allele and one SP-B (B1580_C) were found with higher in nonsmoker and smoker IPF subgroups, respectively, compared with healthy controls. To explore whether a tryptophan (in 6A4) or an arginine (in other SP-A1 alleles and in all SP-A2 alleles) at amino acid 219 alters protein behavior, two truncated proteins that varied only at amino acid 219 were oxidized by exposure to ozone. Differences in the absorption spectra (310\u2013350 nm) between the two truncated rSP-A proteins, before and after protein oxidation, suggested allele-specific aggregation attributable to amino acid 2143. The SP-B SNP B1580_C, to be a risk factor for IPF smokers, was also shown to be a risk factor for other pulmonary diseases. The SP-C and SP-D SNPs and SP-B-linked microsatellite markers did not associate with IPF. These findings indicated that surfactant protein variants may serve as markers to identify subgroups of patients at risk. The observed alleles of SP-A and SP-D in association with various diseases are summarized in Table 43.1. Different alleles of these genes seem to predispose the individuals to various diseases. A logical explanation seems to be that different SNPs lead to different alterations in function or expression. However, common SNPs predispose Caucasians to RDS and Mexicans to TB. Similarly, common SNPs predispose the Indian population to ABPA and TB. Furthermore, Met11 SP-D allele is predisposing Mexicans to TB and Finns to RSV infection. It is also interesting to note that some of the alleles of SP-A interact with other alleles of SP-A and SP-B and thus increase the susceptibility of subjects to a disease (Kishore et al. 2005).\n",

This affects the mucus secreted as part of the lung\u2019s defence and creates sticky, viscous mucus. In patients with CF, neutrophils are recruited in excess to the airways yet pathogens are not cleared and the patients suffer from chronic infections. In CF, the disease-causing gene has been clearly identified as the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene, but genetic variants of the MBP and SP-A have been associated with disease severity in CF. Allele associations and allele interaction of surfactant protein genes in relation to RDS have been discussed (Floros and Fan 2001). Studies have shown a deficiency of SP-A in airway fluids from patients with CF and other inflammatory pulmonary conditions. Findings suggest that the neutrophil serine proteases cathepsin G and/or elastase and/or proteinase-3 may contribute to degradation of SP-A and SP-D, thereby diminishing innate pulmonary antimicrobial defence (Rubio et al. 2004; von Bredow et al. 2001, 2003).",

The significance of serum SP-A, SP-D and KL-6 for diagnosis and treatment of ILD in connective tissue disorders has been evaluated by different workers. Serum KL-6 and SP-D levels are more specific and useful markers for diagnosis and evaluation of ILD compared with serum LDH in connective tissue disorders (Ogawa et al. 2003; Suematsu et al. 2003). Characteristics or disease activity of early ILD has been evaluated in subjects. In abnormal group, curvilinear subpleural lines or thickened interlobular and intralobular lines were observed more frequently in lower lung fields and SP-A and SP-D were higher in true abnormalities group than in control group. True parenchymal abnormalities in posterior subpleural aspect of lung may indicate early ILD activity (Al-Salmi et al. 2005; Kashiwabara 2006). Since higher levels of SP-A and SP-D are associated with more severe lung function impairment at presentation, and better recovery over time, Janssen et al. (2005) suggested that SP-A, SP-D and KL-6 are especial markers of disease activity. Nevertheless, serum pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine (PARC) levels may be more useful marker for active PF in systemic sclerosis (SSc) (Kodera et al. 2005) since elevated PARC values correlated more sensitively reflecting the PF activity than serum KL-6 or SP-D levels.",

Patients with SSc possess higher levels of SP-D than those with other collagen diseases and dermatitis, which may correspond to severity of pulmonary fibrosis (Maeda et al. 2001). The basic and clinical studies of SSc patients with ILD are yielding promising data that may be translated in to more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies Although the SP-D level in sera of patients with polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM) is significantly elevated, the serum SP-D in patients with ILD was still higher than those without ILD, suggesting that serum SP-D level is a useful marker for ILD in patients with PM/DM (Ihn et al. 2002). However, there is a need to investigate whether another connective tissue disease has developed when laboratory findings cannot be explained by usual clinical course of an existing connective tissue disease (Ishiguro et al. 2007).",

KL-6, SP-A and SP-D levels in BALF were increased in pulmonary sarcoidosis. Since these markers are specifically derived from epithelial cells, it is considered that KL-6 and SP-D levels are reflecting damage or release of these markers from epithelial cells due to the inflammatory response. Among serum Clara cell 16 (CC16), KL-6, and SP-D as markers of ILD, and their ability to reflect pulmonary disease severity and prognosis in sarcoidosis, KL-6 is the best marker in differentiating patients from healthy controls (G\u00fcnther et al. 1999; Hamm et al. 1994; Janssen et al. 2003; Kunitake et al. 2001). The median amounts of SP-A in BAL fluid in control subjects was 2.82 mg/L (range, 0.92\u20135.17 mg/L). In comparison to control, SP-A in patients with asthma had a lower value of SP-A, which remained unchanged in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis (van de Graaf et al. 1992). In contrast, SP-A levels in BAL fluids from patients with sarcoidosis were markedly higher than in control subjects and it was comparable with patients of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). In both conditions, SP-A+ alveolar macrophages were increased (G\u00fcnther et al. 1999; Hamm et al. 1994).",

PAP is a rare lung disorder and can be caused by inactivation of either granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or GM receptor common \u03b2-chain (\u03b2c) genes in mice [GM\u2212/\u2212, \u03b2c\u2212/\u2212], demonstrating a critical role of GM-CSF signaling in surfactant homeostasis. Studies demonstrate abnormal accumulation of SP-A and SP-D in air spaces of patients with PAP (Crouch et al. 1993) and the precursors of SP-B, SP-B and SP-C. Although lung histology in \u03b2c\u2212/\u2212 and GM\u2212/\u2212 mice was indistinguishable, distinct differences were observed in surfactant phospholipid and surfactant protein concentrations in lungs of \u03b2c\u2212/\u2212 and GM\u2212/\u2212 mice. The defect in clearance was significantly more severe in GM\u2212/\u2212 than in \u03b2c\u2212/\u2212 mice. GM-CSF concentrations, increased in BALF but not in serum of \u03b2c\u2212/\u2212 mice, were consistent with a pulmonary response to the lack of GM-CSF signaling. The observed differences in surfactant metabolism suggest the presence of alternative clearance mechanisms regulating surfactant homeostasis in mice and may provide a molecular basis for the range in severity of PAP symptoms (Reed et al. 2000). In a young patient with idiopathic PAP, the enhanced serum anti-GM-CSF antibody level demonstrated a striking difference in the distribution of SP-A and SP-D in intra-alveolar substance with idiopathic PAP (Ohtsuki et al. 2008; Kobayashi et al. 2008b).",

Multimerized form of SP-A oligomer (alveolar proteinosis protein-I, APP-I) has been detected besides the normal-sized octadecamer (APP-II) in SP-As isolated from PAP patients. Analysis of APP revealed that it was composed of two proteins. The Mr of APP-I and APP-II were 1.65 MDa and 0.93 MDa, respectively. APP-I and APP-II showed almost identical amino acid compositions. Electron microscopy revealed that APP-II was a hexameric particle, presumably consisting mainly of octadecamers whose diameter was approximately 30 nm. In contrast, APP-I was made of multimerized larger aggregates whose diameter appeared to be about 70\u201390 nm. Both APP-I and APP-II retained the abilities to bind DPPC. Reconstitution experiments with porcine SP-B and phospholipids revealed that multilamellated membranes in structures formed from APP-I consisted of several layers of doubled unit membranes. APP-I failed to form tubular myelin structures. In contrast, APP-II formed well-formed lattice structures seen in tubular myelin The multimerized form of human SP-A oligomer exhibits the reduced capacity to regulate phospholipid secretion from type II cells, and lower affinity to bind to type II cells. It is to be reminded that the integrity of a flower-bouquet-like octadecameric structure of SP-A oligomer is important for the expression of full activity of this protein, indicating the importance of the oligomeric structure of mammalian lectins with collagenous domains. Thus there exists an abnormal multimerized form of SP-A oligomer in the alveoli of patients with PAP that exhibits abnormal function on phospholipid membrane organization (Hattori et al. 1996a, b).",

The major part of SP-A from a proteinosis patient consisted of SP-A2 gene product while SP-A1 gene product was present in only a small amount. The disulfide bridges in the carbohydrate recognition domain were identified to be in the 1\u20134, 2\u20133 pattern common for collectins.

            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), also known as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or adult respiratory distress syndrome (in contrast with IRDS) is a serious reaction to various forms of injuries to lung. ARDS is caused by a variety of direct and indirect issues. It is characterized by inflammation of lung parenchyma leading to impaired gas exchange with concomitant systemic release of inflammatory mediators causing inflammation, hypoxemia and frequently resulting in multiple organ failure. A less severe form is called acute lung injury (ALI). Clinical and biochemical evidences suggest that the etiology of RDS is multifactorial with a significant genetic component. There are reports about polymorphisms and mutations on the surfactant protein genes, especially surfactant proteins-B that may be associated with RDS, ARDS, and congenital alveolar proteinosis. The measurement of SP-A and SP-D in amniotic fluids and tracheal aspirates reflects lung maturity and the production level of the lung surfactant in infants with RDS. The SP-A concentrations in BAL fluids are significantly reduced in patients with ARDS and also in patients at risk to develop ARDS (Kuroki et al. 1998; Takahashi et al. 2006a). Patients with low concentrations of SP-A and SP-B in the BAL are at risk for ARDS before onset of clinically defined lung injury, though the SP-D concentrations remain in normal range. Thus, SP abnormalities occur before and after the onset of ARDS, and the responses of SP-A, SP-B, and SP-D differ in important ways. However, plasma SP-D is a valuable biomarker in ALI/ARDS and SP-A increases during the early phase of ARDS, including some molecular alteration followed by decrease during the late phase (Endo et al. 2002; Kuroki et al. 1998; Takahashi et al. 2006b; Zhu et al. 2001).",

At autopsy RDS lungs lacked tubular myelin and had decreased immunoreactivity for antisera to SP-A, an important component of tubular myelin. Therefore, a role for SP-A in the conversion of lamellar bodies to tubular myelin and in the pathogenesis of RDS was proposed. It was postulated that if SP-A is indeed necessary for the conversion of lamellar bodies to tubular myelin, in RDS either there is a deficiency of adequate amounts of functional SP-A, or some other important component of surfactant is missing (deMello et al. 1993). Mechanical ventilation is the main modality of treatment of ARDS. On mechanical ventilation, there is a progressive increase in SP-A levels in patients with ARDS, and may be one of the contributors for recovery in ARDS. A significant increase within the first 4 days was found in those infants who survived, whereas no such change was found in those infants who died (Balamugesh et al. 2003; Stevens et al. 1992). Intratracheal aerosolization of LPS in rats produces typical features of human ARDS. The SP-D binds inhaled LPS-endotoxin in vivo, which may help to protect the lung from endotoxin-induced disease (van Rozendaal et al. 1999). The SP-D was reduced in lung of young rats following ALI at early stage and early administration of Dex could reverse the SP-D content (Shu et al. 2007). SP-A in sera of cord blood from infants born at gestational ages <32 weeks with RDS was 15.1 ng/mL compared to without RDS (5.8 ng/mL) and significantly related to the non-RDS outcome (Cho et al. 2000). Shimoya et al. (2000) suggested that IL-6 elevation in fetuses with chorioamnionitis promotes fetal lung maturation by inducing SP-A synthesis, thereby decreasing the incidence of RDS in the preterm neonates.",

Reduced pulmonary edema fluid SP-D and elevated plasma SP-A concentrations at the onset of ALI may be associated with more severe disease and worse clinical outcome and may serve as valuable biochemical markers of prognosis (Cheng et al. 2003). The BALF proteome analysis showed the presence of several isoforms of SP-A, in which an N-non-glycosylierte form and several proline hydroxylations were identified (Bai et al. 2007).

In chronic lung injury, SP-A is significantly reduced in alveolar space. SP-D concentration in lavage was nearly equal to that in normal adults, but the total collectin pool in lavage was still significantly reduced. Because these collectins may bind and opsonize bacteria and viruses, decrements in their amounts may present additional risk to those premature infants who require prolonged periods of ventilatory support (Awasthi et al. 1999). Reduced SP-D expression in BAL fluid was associated with progression of bronchial dysplasia in heavy smokers. SP-D levels in BAL fluid may serve a potential biomarker to identify smokers who are at risk of early lung cancer (Sin et al. 2008b). Cheng et al.

Tobacco smoke induces increased alveolo-capillary leakage of SPs into blood and its level in blood may help in the assessment of lung injury caused by smoke. SP-A is occasionally elevated in non-ILD pulmonary patients. Serum SP-A increased in current smokers than in never- or ex-smokers and in COPD and pulmonary thromboembolism than in other diseases. Serum SP-D and KL-6 were unaffected by smoking. Therefore, different baseline levels of serum SP-A need to be established for smokers and non-smokers. Serum SP-A may be a useful marker for predicting COPD in the preclinical stage (Behera et al. 2005; Kobayashi et al. 2008a). Different alleles of SP-A and SP-D associated with various diseases have been summarized by Kishore et al. (2005) and given in Table 43.2. Analysis between COPD and smokers revealed several COPD susceptibility alleles (AA62_A, B1580_C, D2S388_5), based on an odds ratio (OR > 2.5). Results indicate that surfactant protein alleles may be useful in COPD by either predicting the disease in a subgroup and/or by identifying disease subgroups that may be used for therapeutic intervention (Guo et al. 2001).",

Pulmonary emphysema, a major component of COPD, is pathologically characterized by destructive alterations in pulmonary architectures as a result of persistent inflammation. Emphysema may be a dynamic disease process in which alveolar wall cell death and proliferation are repeated. The decrease of surfactant protein secreted by the alveolar type II cell is one of the important causes of limiting air of pulmonary emphysema and the changes of SP-A may be related to emphysematous changes in the lung. Cigarette smoke and LPS alter lung SP-A gene activity and protein homeostasis (Hu et al. 2008). Mice deficient in SP-D\u2212/\u2212 develop progressive emphysema with age. SP-D gene-targeted mice develop severe pulmonary lipidosis, and foamy macrophage infiltrations. By lowering surface tension at the air-water interface in the surfactant deficient premature lung, exogenous surfactant replacement therapy for neonatal RDS has been highly successful in decreasing mortality after preterm birth. It has emerged that SP-A and SP-D have additional roles in host defence distinct from the surface tension lowering effects of surfactant. Recombinant forms of SP-D could be useful therapeutically in attenuating inflammatory processes in neonatal chronic lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and emphysema (Clark and Reid 2003).",

They also can alleviate chronic allergic inflammation by inhibiting T-lymphocyte proliferation as well as increasing phagocytosis of DNA fragments and clearance of apoptotic cell debris. Furthermore, it has emerged, from the studies on SP-D-deficient mice, that, when these mice are challenged with allergen, they develop increased eosinophil infiltration, and abnormal activation of lymphocytes, leading to the production of Th2 cytokines. Intranasal administration of SP-D significantly attenuated the asthmatic-like symptoms seen in allergen-sensitized wild-type, and SP-D-deficient, mice. These findings provide a new insight of role that surfactant proteins play in handling environmental stimuli and in their immunoregulation of airway inflammatory disease (Wang and Reid 2007).",

Studies suggest that the increased levels of SP-A and D may play a protective role in an allergic inflammation in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma. Structural remodelling of airways in asthma that follows inflammation may be affected by SP-D-mediated effects on immune response. SP-D accumulation is increased in this model of allergen-induced eosinophilia, both in upper and lower airways (Cheng et al. 2000; Kasper et al. 2002). SP-D gene-deficient mice (Sftpd\n\u2212/\u2212) have an impaired systemic Th-2 response at baseline and reduced inflammation and airway responses after allergen exposure. Translational studies revealed that a polymorphism in SFTPD gene was associated with lower atopy and possibly asthma susceptibility. Thus, SP-D-dependent innate immunity influences atopy and asthma (Brandt et al. 2008). Dex significantly down-regulates SP-D in allergic airways and lavage fluid. In addition, Dex promoted airway expression of vitamin D-binding protein, heptoglobin and \u03b11-antitrypsin (Zhao et al. 2007).",

Profiles of SP-A and SP-D in acute and chronic inflammation indicated that serum SP-D can serve as a biomarker of lung inflammation in both acute and chronic lung injury in mice (Fujita et al. 2005). Because of their capability to directly inhibit T-cell activation and T-cell-dependent allergic inflammatory events, SP-A and SP-D may be significant contributors to the local control of Th-2 type inflammation in the airways. SP-D is able to reduce the immediate allergen-induced mediator release and the early bronchial obstruction in addition to its effects on airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in an A. fumigatus mouse asthma model. Thus, SP-D not only reduces allergen-induced eosinophilic inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness but also provides protection against early airway obstruction by inhibition of early mediator release (Erpenbeck et al. 2006; Takeda et al. 2003). However, mice sensitized and challenged with either A. fumigatus or OVA increased SP-D levels in their lung. Allergen exposure induced elevation in SP-D protein levels in an IL-4/IL-13-dependent manner, which in turn, prevents further activation of sensitized T cells. This negative feedback regulatory circuit could be essential in protecting the airways from inflammatory damage after allergen inhalation (Haczku et al. 2006). Haczku (2006) support the hypothesis that SP-A and SP-D have a role in regulation of allergic airway sensitization.",

The SP-D is able to bind mite allergens and alleviates allergen-induced airway inflammation and may be an important modulator of allergen-induced pulmonary inflammation (Liu et al. 2005a). There is marked reduction in SP-A and SP-D levels in the BALF of dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Der p)-sensitized BALB/c mice after allergen challenge. Both SP-A and SP-D were able to suppress Der p-stimulated intrapulmonary lymphocyte proliferation of na\u00efve mice with saline or allergen challenge, or of Der p-sensitized mice with saline challenge. On the contrary, this suppressive effect was mild on lymphocytes from sensitized mice after allergen challenge. These results indicated the involvement of pulmonary surfactant proteins in the allergic bronchial inflammation of sensitized mice (Wang et al. 1996, 2001). Both SP-A and SP-D down-regulate the eosinophilic inflammation in murine asthma models and shift the cytokine profile towards a T helper cell type 1 response. In addition, they are effective at alleviating bronchial hyperresponsiveness. There is evidence of activation of innate immune system in asthma which results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and may contribute to the pathogenesis of neutrophilic asthma (Simpson et al. 2007).",

Bone marrow-derived DCs generated in presence of SP-A fail to increase LPS-induced up-regulation of MHC class II and CD86 co-stimulatory molecule on DCs surface and behaves like \u201ctolerogenic DCs\u201d. SP-A may also induce tolerance by suppressing the proliferation of activated T lymphocytes (Hussain 2004). SP-A suppresses lymphocyte proliferation and IL-2 secretion, in part, by binding to its receptor, SP-R210. However, the mechanisms underlying this effect are not well understood. The effects of antibodies against the SP-A-binding (neck) domain (\u03b1-SP-R210n) or nonbinding C-terminal domain (\u03b1-SP-R210ct) of SP-R210 on human peripheral blood T cell immune responses against M. tuberculosis support the hypothesis that SP-A, via SP-R210, suppresses cell-mediated immunity against M. tuberculosis via a mechanism that up-regulates secretion of IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21 (Samten et al. 2008). Role of SP-A and SP-D in linking innate and adaptive immunity to regulate host defense has been suggested by Wright (2005). Although both SP-A and SP-D can bind to T cells and directly inhibit proliferation, SP-A can also indirectly inhibit T-cell proliferation via suppression of dendritic cell (DC) maturation. SP-D has been shown to enhance antigen uptake and presentation. Taken together, these in vitro results suggest that the combined role of SP-A and SP-D is to modulate the immunologic environment of the lung so as to protect the host, yet thwart an overzealous inflammatory response that could potentially damage the lung and impair gas exchange (Wright 2005)",

Incubation of M. tuberculosis with sub-agglutinating concentrations of SP-D leads to reduced adherence of bacteria to macrophages, whereas incubation of bacteria with SP-A leads to significantly increased adherence to monocyte-derived macrophages. Ferguson et al. (2002) provided evidence for specific binding of SP-D to M. tuberculosis and indicated that SP-D and SP-A serve different roles in the innate host response to this pathogen in lung. Further studies provide direct evidence that inhibition of phagocytosis of M. tuberculosis affected by SP-D occurs independently of aggregation process. SP-D limits the intracellular growth of bacilli in macrophages by increasing phagosome-lysosome fusion but not by generating a respiratory burst (Ferguson et al. 2006). Results also provide evidence that SP-A and SP-D enhance mannose receptor-mediated phagocytosis of M. avium by macrophages (Kudo et al. 2004). Virulent and attenuated M. tuberculosis strains bind best to immobilized SP-A (Hall-Stoodley et al. 2006). Mycobacterium avium has developed numerous mechanisms for entering mononuclear phagocytes. The SP-A, and SP-D, exhibit a concentration-dependent binding to M. avium.

Seifart et al.

TTF-1 is frequently expressed in human lung cancer, especially in adenocarcinoma and small cell lung cancer, and TTF-1 expression is closely related to the expression of surfactant protein. Zamecnik and Kodet (2002) described positive results for TTF-1 and SP-A in 75% and 46% of pulmonary adenocarcinomas and in 50% and 25% of pulmonary non-neuroendocrine large cell carcinomas (LCCs), respectively. Small cell lung carcinomas were TTF-1 positive in 89% of cases and completely negative for SP-A. Squamous cell carcinomas and carcinoid tumors were negative for both proteins. The frequency of TTF-1 expression in the nucleus was very low in human lung cancer cell lines; however, their cytoplasmic positivities should be further investigated (Fujita et al. 2003. Rossi et al. (2003) (1) support the metaplastic histogenetic theory for pulmonary carcinomas group of tumors; (2) show that cytokeratin 7 and TTF-1, but not SP-A, are useful immunohistochemical markers in this setting, and (3) suggest that this group of tumors has a worse prognosis than conventional NSCL carcinoma at surgically curable stages I, justifying their segregation as an independent histologic type. Lu et al. (2006) suggested that nuclear inclusions positive for SP-A antibody staining in adenocarcinomas of lung were derived from accumulated content in the perinuclear cistern resembling pseudoinclusion processes and composed of proteins antigenically cross-reactive with SP-A. Because of its diagnostic utility TTF-1 should be added to a panel of antibodies used for assessing tumors of unknown origin. The combination of anti-TTF-1 with anti-SP-A does not increase the diagnostic usefulness of TTF-1 alone (Lu et al. 2006). Suzuki et al. (2005) and Ueno et al. (2003) reported that Napsin is better marker than SP-A for diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. Napsin A is an aspartic proteinase expressed in lung and kidney.

SP-D concentration was reduced to half, though SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C were not different from controls. SP-D was inversely correlated to neutrophils, and high numbers of bacteria were associated with lower SP-D concentrations. It was suggested that bacteria and low SP-D support neutrophilic inflammation in the lower respiratory tract of nonsymptomatic with children with tracheostomy (Griese et al. 2004). BAL fluids from patients carrying a chronic tracheostoma agglutinated P. aeruginosa, which was completely inhibited by maltose. The agglutination of P. aeruginosa by BAL fluid was related in part to the concentration of SP-D. Additional factors, such as the multimeric organization of SP-D, are likely to contribute to the agglutination of microorganisms by BAL or other body fluids (Griese and Starosta 2005).",

Because race, gestational age (GA), and sex are risk factors for RDS, Kala et al. (1998) studied the distribution and frequencies of SP-A alleles/genotypes while adjusting for these factors as confounders or effect modifiers in control and RDS populations with GAs ranging from 24 week to term. Although the odds ratios of several alleles and genotypes were in opposite directions for black and white subjects, the homogeneity of odds ratio reached statistical significance only in case of 6A3/6A3. Although differences were observed in subgroups with different GAs of RDS white population, definitive conclusions could not be made regarding the effect of modification by GA or as a function of sex. Study suggested that (1) the genetic analyses of RDS and SP-A locus should be performed separately for black and white populations and (2) SP-A alleles/genotypes and SP-B variant may contribute to the etiology of RDS and/or may serve as markers for disease subgroups. In a genetically homogeneous Finnish population, R\u00e4met et al. (2000) showed that certain SP-A1 alleles (6A2 and 6A3) and an SP-A1/SP-A2 haplotype (6A2/1A0) were associated with RDS. The 6A2 allele was over-represented and the 6A3 allele was under-represented in infants with RDS. According to results, diseases associated with premature birth did not explain the association between the odds of a particular homozygous SP-A1 genotype (6A2/6A2 and 6A3/6A3) and RDS. In the population evaluated, SP-B intron 4 variant frequencies were low and had no association with RDS. Thus, SP-A gene locus is an important determinant for predisposition to RDS in premature infants.",

Instead, results showed that known association between SP-A alleles and RDS was dependent on the SP-B Ile131Thr genotype.

Distribution of SP-A and SP-B gene variants between RDS and no-RDS infants were determined alone and in combination. The SP-A1 allele 6A2 and homozygous genotype 6A2/6A2 are over-represented in RDS of singletons when SP-B exon 4 genotype was Thr/Thr, and under represented in RDS of multiples when the SP-B genotype was Ile/Thr. The SP-A 6A2 allele in SP-B Thr131 background predisposed the smallest singleton infants to RDS, whereas near-term multiples were protected from RDS. There was a continuous association between fetal mass and risk of RDS, defined by SP-A and SP-B variants. Labeled lung explants with the Thr/Thr genotype showed proSP-B amino-terminal glycosylation, which was absent in Ile/Ile samples. Hence, Genetic and environmental variation may influence intracellular processing of surfactant complex and the susceptibility to RDS (Marttila et al. 2003b). However, the association between SP-A polymorphisms and RDS may not be applicable to entire population of premature infants. In twins, the association between SP-A polymorphism and RDS is different from that seen in premature singleton infants. The factor associated with SP-A genotype-specific susceptibility to RDS appears to be related to the size of uterus and length of gestation at birth (Marttila et al. 2003a). Zhai et al. (2008) reported that the frequency of SP-A1 allele 6A2 and 6A3 expression of SP-A in Chinese premature infants was low in neonatal RDS. In contrast, the frequency of SP-A2 allele 1A0 and 1A1 was high in normal Chinese premature infants. It supports that SP-A1 allele 6A2 may be a susceptible gene for RDS.",

Genetic haplotypes of these SP genes are associated with the development of RDS. Studies identify protective haplotypes against RDS and support findings related to SP genetic differences in children who develop RDS. An allele association study of 19 polymorphisms in SP-A1, SP-A2, SP-B, and SP-D genes in ARDS was carried out. Analysis revealed differences in frequency of alleles for some of the microsatellite markers flanking SP-B, and for one polymorphism (C/T) at nucleotide 1580 [C/T (1580)], within codon 131 (Thr131Ile) of the SP-B gene. The latter determines the presence or absence of a potential N-linked glycosylation site. Based on the odds ratio, the C allele may be viewed as a susceptibility factor for ARDS. These data suggest that SP-B or a linked gene contributes to susceptibility to ARDS (Lin et al. 2000; Thomas et al. 2007).",

The Met11Thr polymorphism in the N-terminal part of SP-D is important determinant in serum SP-D. But this polymorphism is also essential to the function and assembly into oligomers. SP-D levels did not correlate with traditional disease activity measures. The Thr11/Thr11 genotype and the Thr11 allele tended to be more frequent in RA patients. Therefore, the low serum level of SP-D and the lack of correlation with traditional disease activity measures indicate that SP-D reflects a distinctive aspect in the RA pathogenesis (Hoegh et al. 2008; Miyata et al. 2002). Trinder et al. (2000) were able to show autoreactivity to SP-A, as expressed by IgG and IgM autoantibodies, and present in synovial fluid (SF) from patients with RA. There was no cross-reactivity between autoantibodies reactive with type II collagen (CII) and those reactive with SP-A or C1q; However, autoantibodies reacted with polymeric (dimers and larger) SP-A, but not with monomeric SP-A subunits, indicating that a degree of quaternary structure is required for antibody binding.",

Nitration and oxidation of SP-A was not altered by the presence of lipids, suggesting that proteins are preferred targets in lipid-rich mixtures such as pulmonary surfactant. Moreover, both horseradish peroxidase and myeloperoxidase (MPO) can utilize NO2\u2212 and H2O2 as substrates to catalyze tyrosine nitration in SP-A, and inhibit its lipid aggregation function. SP-A nitration and oxidation by MPO is markedly enhanced in presence of Cl\u2212 and the lipid aggregation function of SP-A is completely abolished. Studies suggest that MPO released by activated neutrophils during inflammation utilizes physiological or pathological levels of NO2\u2212 to nitrate proteins, and may provide an additional mechanism in addition to ONOO \u2013 formation, for tissue injury in ARDS and other inflammatory diseases associated with upregulated NO* and oxidant production.

Although inhaled NO increases oxygenation in clinical trials, inhibiting NOS can be protective. However, inhalation of NO may not be indicated in sepsis because of excessive NO production. Aikio et al. (2003) indicated that inhaled NO is effective in a select group of small premature infants and that the responsiveness to NO is associated with low NOS2 enzyme. Very low birth-weight infants (birthweight <1,500 g), infants with progressive respiratory failure and infection at birth have deficient pulmonary NOS2 and cytokine response. After surfactant therapy, these infants responded strikingly to inhaled NO. An acute pulmonary inflammatory response may contribute to respiratory adaptation in early-onset pneumonia. In intact lambs inhaled NO increased SP-A and SP-B mRNA and protein content with no change in DNA content. The mechanisms and physiological effects of these findings warrant further investigation (Stuart et al. 2003; Hu et al. 2007). Exposure of rats to NO2 showed impairment of SP-A and a higher alveolar pool size after in vivo exposure. The NO2-induced alterations of SP-A may contribute to the pulmonary toxicity of this oxidant (M\u00fcller et al. 1992). NO production from NOS2 expressed in lung parenchymal cells in a murine model of ARDS correlates with abnormal surfactant function and reduced SP-B expression. NOS2\u2212/\u2212 null mice exhibit significantly less physiologic lung dysfunction and loss of SP-B expression. Study indicated that the expression of NOS2 in lung epithelial cells is critical for the development of lung injury and mediates surfactant dysfunction independent of NOS2 inflammatory cell expression and cytokine production (Baron et al. 2004).",

The increased expression of SP-A mRNA under hyperoxia can be attributed, at least in part, to an induction of mRNA and protein expression in bronchial Clara cells. The expanded role of Clara cells in the defence against hyperoxic injury suggests that they support alveolar type 2 cell function and may play an important role in the supply of surfactant proteins to the lower airways (ter Horst et al. 2006). The inhaled nitric oxide treatment of premature infants at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia does not adversely affect endogenous surfactant function or composition and may improve surfactant function transiently (Ballard et al. 2007). Chorioamnionitis is a risk factor for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Endotoxin-induced oxidative stress to the fetus in the uniquely hypoxic intrauterine environment has been reported. SP-A and B mRNAs were highest at Day 2, suggesting that oxidative stress did not contribute to the lung maturation response. A modest lung oxidative stress in chorioamnionitis could contribute to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Cheah et al. 2008).",

SP-D interacts with glycoprotein allergens of house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Derp) via its CRDs and thus inhibits specific IgE, isolated from mite-sensitive asthmatic patients, from binding these allergens, and blocking subsequent histamine release from sensitized basophils. Exogenous administration of SP-A and SP-D diminishes allergic hypersensitivity in vivo. A fragment of recombinant human SP-D (rfh SP-D) has a therapeutic effect on allergen-induced bronchial inflammation through its inhibitory effect on NO and TNF-\u03b1 production by A\u03a6s, and thus preventing the development of Th-2 type cytokine response (Liu et al. 2005b; Singh et al. 2003). The rfhSP-D that is effective in diminishing allergic hypersensitivity in mouse models of dust mite allergy was more susceptible to degradation than the native full-length protein. The degradation and consequent inactivation of SP-A and SP-D may be a mechanism to account for the potent allergenicity of these common dust mite allergens (Deb et al. 2007). Evidence suggests for an antiinflammatory role for SP-D in response to noninfectious, subacute lung injury via modulation of oxidative-nitrative stress (Casey et al. 2005).",

Hence, recombinant conglutinin and a chimeric protein containing NH2 terminus and collagen domain of rat SP-D (rSP-D) fused to neck region and CRD of conglutinin (termed SP-D/Cong(neck + CRD)) have markedly greater ability to inhibit infectivity of IAV than wild-type recombinant rSP-D, confirming that potent IAV-neutralizing activity of conglutinin resides in its neck region and CRD. Furthermore, SP-D/Cong(neck + CRD) also caused substantially greater enhancement of neutrophil binding and H2O2 responses to IAV than r-conglutinin or rSP-D. Hence, chimeric SP-D/Cong(neck + CRD) protein showed favorable antiviral and opsonic properties of conglutinin and SP-D (Hartshorn et al. 2000a). Thus, the SP-D N-terminal and/or collagen domains contribute to the enhanced bacterial binding and aggregating activities of SP-D. Although replacement of neck recognition domains and CRDs of SP-D with those of MBL and conglutinin confer increased viral binding activity, it does not favorably affect bacterial binding activity, suggesting that requirements for optimal collectin binding to influenza virus and bacteria differ (Hartshorn et al. 2007).",

In contrast, a trimeric neck and CRD construct of bovine serum collectin CL-46 induces aggregation of IAV and potently increases IAV uptake by neutrophils. CL-46-NCRD showed calcium-dependent and sugar-sensitive binding to both neutrophils and IAV. Results indicate that collectins can act as opsonins for IAV even in the absence of the collagen domain or higher order multimerization.

The pulmonary lipoidosis in SP-D\u2212/\u2212 mice was not associated with accumulation of SP-B or C, or their mRNAs, distinguishing the disorder from alveolar proteinosis syndromes. Surfactant protein A mRNA was reduced and, SP-A protein appeared to be reduced in SP-D\u2212/\u2212 compared with wild type mice. Targeting of mouse SP-D gene caused accumulation of surfactant lipid and altered phospholipid structures, demonstrating a unsuspected role for SP-D in surfactant lipid homeostasis in vivo (Botas et al. 1998; Korfhagen et al. 1998; Ikegami et al. 2005). HDL cholesterol was significantly elevated in SP-D\u2212/\u2212 mice while treatment of SP-D\u2212/\u2212 mice with rhSP-D resulted in decreases of HDL-cholesterol as well as total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol along with reduced plasma TNF-\u03b1 in SP-D\u2212/\u2212 mice. It shows that SP-D regulates atherogenesis in mouse model (Sorensen et al. 2006). SP-D plays a critical role in the suppression of alveolar macrophage activation, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation and emphysema (Wert et al. 2000). Oxidant production and reactive oxygen species were increased in lungs of SP-D\u2212/\u2212 mice, in turn activate NF-kB and MMP expression.

SP-A inhibited production of NO and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in rat A\u03a6 stimulated with smooth LPS. In contrast, SP-A enhanced production of NO and iNOS in cells stimulated with IFN-\u03b3 or IFN-\u03b3 plus LPS. SP-A contributes to the lung inflammatory response by exerting differential effects on the responses of immune cells, depending on their state and mechanism of activation (Stamme et al. 2000). NO is involved in a variety of signaling processes, and because altered NO metabolism has been observed in inflammation, it is predicted that alterations in its metabolism would underlie the proinflammatory state observed in SP-D deficiency (Atochina et al. 2004a, c). Treatment with the iNOS inhibitor 1,400 W can inhibit inflammatory phenotype and can attenuate inflammatory processes within SP-D deficiency. Mice treated with 1,400 W reduced total lung NO synthase activity (Atochina-Vasserman et al. 2007). Guo et al. (2008) suggest that NO controls the dichotomous nature of SP-D and that posttranslational modification by S-nitrosylation causes quaternary structural alterations in SP-D causing it to switch its inflammatory signaling role. This represents new insight into both the regulation of protein function by S-nitrosylation and NO\u2019s role in innate immunity (Guo et al. 2008). Thus, inflammation that occurs in SP-D deficiency is due to an increase in NO production and a shift in the chemistry and targets of NO from a disruption of NO-mediated signaling within the innate immune system. However, purified preparations of SPs often contain endotoxin and the functions of SP-A and SP-D are affected by endotoxin. Therefore, the monitoring of SP preparations for endotoxin contamination is important (Wright et al. 1999).",
