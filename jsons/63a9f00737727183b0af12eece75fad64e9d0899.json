            "text": "Human herpesviruses are among the most prevalent pathogens worldwide and have become an important public health issue. Recurrent infections and the emergence of resistant viral strains reinforce the need of searching new drugs to treat herpes virus infections. Cardiac glycosides are used clinically to treat cardiovascular disturbances, such as congestive heart failure and atrial arrhythmias. In recent years, they have sparked new interest in their potential anti-herpes action. It has been previously reported by our research group that two new semisynthetic cardenolides, namely C10 (3\u03b2-[(N-(2-hydroxyethyl)aminoacetyl] amino-3-deoxydigitoxigenin) and C11 (3\u03b2-(hydroxyacetyl)amino-3-deoxydigitoxigenin), exhibited potential anti-HSV-1 and anti-HSV-2 with selectivity index values > 1,000, comparable with those of acyclovir. This work reports the mechanism investigation of anti-herpes action of these derivatives. The results demonstrated that C10 and C11 interfere with the intermediate and final steps of HSV replication, but not with the early stages, since they completely abolished the expression of the UL42 (\u03b2) and gD (\u03b3) proteins and partially reduced that of ICP27 (\u03b1). Additionally, they were not virucidal and had no prophylactic effects. Both compounds inhibited HSV replication at nanomolar concentrations, but cardenolide C10 was more active than C11 and can be considered as an anti-herpes drug candidate including against acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 strains.",

Most of the drugs used to treat herpesvirus infections are nucleoside analogs that share the same mechanism of action, affecting viral DNA synthesis by inhibiting viral DNA polymerase, such as acyclovir (ACV), the gold standard in the treatment of herpetic infections [3] . Such infections have become an important public health issue, mainly due to the HSV ability to cause acute and recurrent infections, as well as the emergence of resistant strains, which hinder the management of herpesvirus infections [4] [5] [6] . New anti-herpes drugs are therefore needed. Cardenolides are cardiac glycosides mainly found in plant species, such as Nerium oleander L., Asclepias curassavica L. (Apocynaceae), Digitalis lanata Ehrh., and Digitalis purpurea L. (Plantaginaceae). These compounds have been used clinically for over 200 years to treat heart diseases [7] and are characterized by their powerful cardiotonic action [8] . The mechanism of their cardiotonic action occurs through the inhibition of Na + /K + -ATPase, involved in the Na + /K + pump mechanism dependent on these ions, and promoting cardiac muscle contraction [9] .",

Earlier studies have shown that different samples, such as a cranberry extract [52] and a diterpene isolated from Andrographis paniculata Nees [53] were able to inhibit in a similar way the expression of these HSV-1 proteins as much as HSV-2 ones. Here, although the reduction of gD, UL42 and ICP27 expression by C10 and C11 was only tested using HSV-1 (KOS strain), all other experiments were performed against both strains of HSV-1 (KOS and 29-R) and strain 333 of HSV-2. The results showed similar inhibition profiles for all viral replication steps evaluated. Consequently, we presume that both compounds would act in the same way against HSV-1 (29-R strain) and HSV-2 replication by inhibiting the expression of the same proteins.",

C10 and C11 reduced significantly the areas of formed viral plaques when compared to viral controls, and these results could be a consequence of the inhibition of viral release. Several studies have demonstrated the anti-herpes activity of natural products, some of which interfere with early steps [41, 42, [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] , while a few affect the last steps of HSV replication [65] [66] [67] [68] , as was demonstrated for C10 and C11. For this reason, both cardenolides could be used in combination with other natural products to ensure that different stages of HSV replication would be inhibited, for example with transresveratrol, for which significant anti-HSV activity has also been described [69] .",

            "text": "The mechanism by which cardenolides affect several steps of HSV replication could be related to the inhibition of Na + / K + -ATPase in host cells. Many studies have demonstrated the modulation of Na + /K + -ATPase functions in host cells by DNA viruses (adenoviruses [18] , cytomegalovirus [23, [70] [71] [72] , and HSV [27, 28] ), and RNA viruses (chikungunya virus [19, 73] , coronaviruses [20, 74, 75] , respiratory syncytial virus [76, 77] , Ebola virus [78, 79] , influenza virus in the presence and absence (viral control) of each concentration of C10 and C11 were captured. ns, not significant; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ****, p < 0.0001 vs. the respective viral controls (two-way ANOVA, Dunnett's post-hoc test) [33, 80, 81] , and HIV [30, 31, 82] ). By activating signaling cascades or by altering the concentration of intracellular ions, the binding of cardenolides to Na + /K + -ATPase seems to create an unfavorable environment for viral replication. Bertol et al. [26] showed that the inhibition of Na + /K + -ATPase caused by glucoevatromonoside was correlated with virus release and viral protein synthesis due to a reduction in the K + concentration in the cell. Cohen et al. [23] found that the inhibitory activity of cytomegalovirus replication by convallatoxin was due to a decrease in immediate-early gene expression and that the antiviral potency depends on the structure of cardiac glycosides and their specific interactions with Na + / K + -ATPase. It was also shown that influenza virus replication was impaired by ouabain through the inhibition of viral protein translation and a decrease in the intracellular K + concentration [37] . Finally, Boff et al. [38] showed that C10 and C11 inhibited Na + /K + -ATPase, and a reduction in intracellular K + concentration could explain the inhibitory activity of those steps of viral infection. In summary, the main antiviral mechanisms suggested for both DNA and RNA viruses are decreased transcription of viral genes and impaired synthesis of viral proteins due to interference with the host translational machinery, such as the inhibition of Na + /K + -ATPase [37] . Structural differences among cardenolides, such as the substituents on the aglycone moiety and the number of sugars, may vary and alter their antiviral activity. Most of the cardenolides tested by Bertol et al. [26] , Dodson et al. [27] , and Su et al. [28] presented one or more sugar moieties bind to C3, unlike the cardenolides C10 and C11. Both of which have substituted amine groups at C3 and are able to inhibit HSV replication at nanomolar concentrations, but not with the same potency as cardenolides bearing sugars at C3. Thus, the sugar moiety, although not essential for anti-herpes activity, nevertheless influences this activity positively. Moreover, C10 was found to be more active than C11 in all experiments, and therefore, we hypothesize that the secondary amine group located on the side chain might also contribute to the antiviral activity. Consistent with this, Fytas et al. [83] and Tataridis et al. [84] showed that the presence of additional amino groups in adamantane derivatives increased their antiviral activity.",

In a minor extension, they also interfere with the intermediate stages of viral replication but not with the early steps. Additionally, they were not virucidal and have no prophylactic effects. These results encourage us to continue studying cardenolides as an alternative for the treatment of herpes simplex virus infections. Despite both compounds presented promising results, C10 was more potent with a lower IC 50 value and the best selectivity index. Wherefore, they can be considered new bioactive molecules with great potential as anti-herpes drug candidates mainly for HSV-1 (29-R strain), which is resistant to ACV treatment.",
