            "text": "Equine arteritis virus (EAV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) represent two members of the family Arteriviridae and pose major threats for the horse-and swine-breeding industries worldwide. A previous study suggested that PRRSV nsp4, a 3C-like protease, antagonizes interferon beta (IFN-\u2424) production by cleaving the NF-B essential modulator (NEMO) at a single site, glutamate 349 (E349). Here, we demonstrated that EAV nsp4 also inhibited virus-induced IFN-\u2424 production by targeting NEMO for proteolytic cleavage and that the scission occurred at four sites: E166, E171, glutamine 205 (Q205), and E349. Additionally, we found that, besides the previously reported cleavage site E349 in NEMO, scission by PRRSV nsp4 took place at two additional sites, E166 and E171. These results imply that while cleaving NEMO is a common strategy utilized by EAV and PRRSV nsp4 to antagonize IFN induction, EAV nsp4 adopts a more complex substrate recognition mechanism to target NEMO. By analyzing the abilities of the eight different NEMO fragments resulting from EAV or PRRSV nsp4 scission to induce IFN-\u2424 production, we serendipitously found that a NEMO fragment (residues 1 to 349) could activate IFN-\u2424 transcription more robustly than full-length NEMO, whereas all other NEMO cleavage products were abrogated for the IFN-\u2424-inducing capacity. Thus, NEMO cleavage at E349 alone may not be sufficient to completely inactivate the IFN response via this signaling adaptor. Altogether, our findings suggest that EAV and PRRSV nsp4 cleave NEMO at multiple sites and that this strategy is critical for disarming the innate immune response for viral survival.",

Previous work suggested that PRRSV nsp4 suppresses type I IFN production by cleaving NEMO at a single site. In contrast, the present study demonstrates that both EAV and PRRSV nsp4 cleave NEMO at multiple sites and that this strategy is essential for disruption of type I IFN production. Moreover, we reveal that EAV nsp4 also cleaves NEMO at glutamine 205 (Q205), which is not targeted by PRRSV nsp4. Notably, targeting a glutamine in NEMO for cleavage has been observed only with picornavirus 3C proteases (3C pro ) and coronavirus 3CL pro . In aggregate, our work expands knowledge of the innate immune evasion mechanisms associated with NEMO cleavage by arterivirus nsp4 and describes a novel substrate recognition characteristic of EAV nsp4.",

Various concentrations of the EAV nsp4 expression plasmid and the IFN-\u2424 luciferase (IFN-\u2424-Luc) reporter plasmid were cotransfected into HEK293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1A , EAV nsp4 strongly inhibited the SEV-induced IFN-\u2424 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner.

Our results demonstrated that these five molecules significantly activated the IFN-\u2424 promoter compared with the empty vector control, and EAV nsp4 significantly inhibited the activation of the IFN-\u2424 promoter by RIG-I, MDA5, IPS-1, or NEMO-K277A, which is a constitutively active NEMO mutant ( Fig. 2A) .

Of these arteriviruses, EAV and PRRSV are considered to be significant etiological agents in the field of veterinary research due to the economic losses that they cause in the equineand swine-breeding industries worldwide (3) . Stallions are susceptible to EAV infection; persistently infected stallions can infect and cause abortion in pregnant mares via their semen (4) (5) (6) , and foals infected with EAV often suffer from fatal bronchointerstitial pneumonia or pneumoenteric syndrome (7) . EAV is capable of persisting in the reproductive tract despite the presence of local mucosal antibodies and inflammatory responses (8) . PRRSV infection presents as severe reproductive failure in sows and respiratory distress in piglets and growing pigs (9) . As arteriviruses, EAV and PRRSV share some similar molecular properties, such as their replication strategy, capacity for establishing persistent infection, and ease of transmission from infected animals to naive animals (10, 11) . These viral characteristics cause the corresponding diseases to be difficult to control. Currently available drugs and vaccines confer insufficient protection against these diseases (12, 13) , so it is important to find a suitable strategy to prevent arterivirus proliferation in the host.",

The arterivirus genome consists of 10 to 12 known functional open reading frames (ORFs) (ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, ORF3 to ORF7, ORF5a, and a transframe fusion [TF] ORF) (15) . ORFs 1a and 1b, located in the 5= three-quarters of the arterivirus genome, encode two long nonstructural precursor polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab (16) . These polyproteins are subsequently cleaved into mature nonstructural proteins (nsp's) by ORF1a-encoded proteases (17) . In EAV, ORF1a contains three proteases, two cysteine proteases located in nsp1 and nsp2 and a chymotrypsin-like serine protease in nsp4, which are involved in releasing the nsp1 to nsp3 and nsp3 to nsp12 proteins from pp1a/ab (18) (19) (20) . nsp1 and nsp2 are involved in cleavage at the nsp1/2 and nsp2/3 sites, whereas nsp4 is responsible for cleavage of the remaining nsp's (21) . The nsp1\u2423, nsp1\u2424, nsp2, and nsp4 proteins of PRRSV are responsible for its self-cleavage processing (22, 23) . Arterivirus nsp4 plays a significant role in the processing of pp1a and pp1ab for nonstructural proteins that direct genome replication and subgenomic mRNA (sg-mRNA) synthesis. Due to its indispensable role in viral replication, arterivirus nsp4 is an appealing target for antiviral drugs.",

After sensing cytoplasmic viral RNA, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are recognized by host PRRs. Subsequently, the PRRs interact with the adaptor mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) (also known as IPS-1/VISA/Cardif) and further recruit a bridging adaptor molecule, NF-B essential modulator (NEMO), which is responsible for the recruitment of TRAF family memberassociated NF-B activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IB kinase (IKK), to further activate the IKK complex. As a result, the activated IKK complex leads to the phosphorylation and activation of NF-B and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which directly induce IFN production (27, 28) .",

Previous work demonstrated that coronavirus (CoV) 3CL protease (3CL pro ) and picornavirus-encoded 3C proteases (3C pro ) possess characteristics that suppress IFN-\u2424 production (29) (30) (31) (32) . Recent studies showed that PRRSV nsp4 could block NF-B signaling to inhibit IFN production (33) . Because infection with EAV could suppress IFN production, and viral 3CL pro and 3C pro have been identified as IFN antagonists, here, we investigated the role of EAV 3CL pro (encoded by nsp4) in regulating the IFN response. Our results clearly demonstrated that EAV nsp4 impairs RIG-I/MDA5 signaling by cleaving the crucial adaptor molecule NEMO at multiple sites. We identified EAV nsp4 cleavage sites within NEMO and revealed that the final cleavage products were severely impaired for IFN signaling. Unlike PRRSV nsp4, EAV nsp4 can also cleave NEMO by identifying glutamine (Q) at the P1 position, the first amino acid on the left side of the recognition site. The above-described results reveal a comprehensive mechanism by which EAV nsp4 antagonizes type I IFN signaling and identify a novel substrate recognition characteristic of EAV nsp4. nsp4 ( Fig. 2A) , demonstrating that EAV nsp4 inhibits RIG-I/MDA5 signaling by targeting a molecule upstream of TBK1.",

Both EAV and PRRSV, two members of the family Arteriviridae, encode nsp4 proteins with similar structures and functions (1, 3, 35) . Previous research revealed that PRRSV nsp4 cleaves NEMO at glutamate 349 (E349) to produce a single faster-migrating protein band (33) . To further compare the NEMO cleavage mediated by different members of the family Arteriviridae, EAV nsp4 or PRRSV nsp4 expression plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells along with NEMO expression plasmids. Western blotting of the resulting cell lysates demonstrated that the size of the smallest-migrating protein band in EAV nsp4-mediated cleavage was similar to that in PRRSV nsp4-mediated cleavage. Interestingly, two new smaller bands (\u03f317 kDa in size) in the NEMO/PRRSV nsp4 coexpression samples were detected, and these two bands seemed to share a cleavage site similar to the one observed in the NEMO/EAV nsp4 coexpression samples (Fig. 3A) . Only NEMO E349 has been previously reported to be cleaved by PRRSV nsp4 (28), so we further transfected different doses of PRRSV nsp4 into HEK293T cells along with NEMO. The results showed that two new smaller bands (\u03f317 kDa in size) were present in a PRRSV nsp4 dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B) , demonstrating that PRRSV nsp4 can cleave two residues near the N terminus of NEMO in addition to the reported cleavage residue E349. Thus, our results indicate that both the EAV and PRRSV nsp4 proteins possess the ability to cleave multiple sites of NEMO.",

NEMO(E166A-E171A-E349A) was cotransfected into HEK293T cells along with EAV nsp4, and these cells were evaluated by Western blotting. The resulting blot revealed that the two smallest bands were not present in lysates from NEMO(E166A-E171A-E349A)transfected cells (Fig. 4E ). This finding indicates that EAV nsp4 and PRRSV nsp4 can target NEMO at common residues E166, E171, and E349. EAV nsp4 cleaves NEMO by recognizing Q and E residues at the P1 position. We next performed experiments to identify the unique NEMO cleavage site used by EAV nsp4. Based on the \u03f320-kDa molecular weight of the fourth band and the high preference of nsp4 for E residues at the P1 position, we generated two truncation mutants, NEMO(1-189) and NEMO , to determine the cleavage position of the fourth cleavage product. The results from experiments using the two truncation mutants NEMO(1-189) and NEMO showed that the cleavage position of the unidentified fourth cleavage product was located between residues 189 and 216 (Fig.  5A, lanes 5 and 6) . However, E210 is the only E residue present among these residues, and a mutation in NEMO residue E210 did not affect the presence of the fourth cleavage product from EAV nsp4-mediated cleavage (Fig. 5A) . These findings suggest that a nonclassical residue in the P1 position can be cleaved by EAV nsp4. Thus, we further analyzed the substrate specificity of EAV nsp4 in viral polyproteins from different EAV strains. The resulting data reveal that EAV nsp4 exhibits a high degree of preference for Glu (E) at the P1 position but that it also recognizes Q residues, even though the preference for them is quite low (Fig. 5B ).",

To explore the detailed mechanism of this activation, NEMO-K277A(1-349) was cotransfected into HEK293T cells along with PRRSV nsp4 or EAV nsp4. The activation of the IFN-\u2424 promoter by NEMO-K277A(1-349) was significantly inhibited in the presence of PRRSV nsp4 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A) , and similar results were found in the presence of EAV nsp4 (Fig. 7B) . The suppression of IFN-\u2424 promoter activation by PRRSV nsp4 or EAV nsp4 was diminished upon expression of their respective enzymatic mutants ( Fig. 7C and D), suggesting that the protease activity of nsp4 participates in inhibiting the NEMO-K277A(1-349)-mediated activation of IFN-\u2424. These results indicate that both EAV nsp4 and PRRSV nsp4 target NEMO(1-349) for deep cleavage.",

However, during coevolution with their host, viruses always evolve a variety of strategies to escape and even inhibit host IFN responses (36, 37) . Of these strategies, the cleavage of crucial signal molecules by a main viral protease is considered to be a particularly effective way for virus to escape the innate immune response (38, 39) . For example, 3C proteases (3C pro ) of coxsackievirus A16, coxsackievirus A6, and enterovirus D68, which belong to the family Picornaviridae, can inhibit NF-B activation by cleaving transforming growth factor \u2424-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) (29) . Additionally, coxsackievirus B and hepatitis C virus disrupt RIG-I/MDA5 signaling through the cleavage of MAVS by 3C pro or NS3-4A proteases (39, 40) . Here, we verified that, similarly to PRRSV nsp4, EAV nsp4 could also serve as an IFN antagonist by targeting the crucial adaptor molecule NEMO. Surprisingly, we found that catalytically inactive EAV nsp4 mutants retained slight inhibition of SEV-induced IFN production.

It is well known that the protease-substrate interaction is the first step in the proteolytic activity of proteases. Catalytically inactive mutants of viral proteases, such as PEDV nsp5 (43) and FMDV 3C pro (44) , which lose their proteolytic activities, could form a complex with substrates. We speculate that the association between enzyme-inactive mutants and NEMO could contribute to the slight ability of catalytically inactive EAV nsp4 mutants to inhibit IFN induction. However, compared with the overexpression of wild-type EAV nsp4, the repression of SEV-mediated IFN-\u2424 promoter activation was strongly relieved with the overexpression of H39A, D65A, and S120A mutants. Thus, the proteolytic activity of EAV nsp4 is involved in suppressing IFN-\u2424 production.",

Similar situations were also reported in work on Seneca Valley virus (SVV)-mediated MAVS, Toll/interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-\u2424 (TRIF), and TRAF family member-associated NF-B activator (TANK) cleavage (45) . Although SVV 3C pro could cleave MAVS, TRIF, and TANK, the corresponding cleavage products were not detected during SVV infection (45) . Although we failed to detect the endogenous cleavage products of NEMO in PRRSV-infected porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) or in EAV-infected Marc-145 cells, we observed a degradation of the NEMO protein abundance following viral infection. Thus, we speculate that the NEMO cleavage products may be short-lived during EAV or PRRSV infection. Initially, we would like to know whether arterivirus nsp4 is sufficient for endogenous NEMO degradation during EAV and PRRSV infection by reverse-genetics methods. However, the catalytically inactive mutants of EAV or PRRSV (EAV nsp4-H39A, -D65A, and -S120A and PRRSV nsp4-H39A, -D64A, and -S118A in our study) could not be rescued, and a possible cause is that the catalytically inactive nsp4 mutation also loses the ability to cleave the polyprotein of EAV or PRRSV. Future investigations to identify some mutants of nsp4 that abolish the ability to cleave NEMO but do not affect the ability to cleave the virus-encoded polyprotein will be required.",

However, there is an exclusive site at Q205 for EAV-mediated NEMO cleavage, demonstrating that EAV nsp4 adopts a distinct substrate recognition characteristic for the P1 position targeting NEMO. A similar occurrence has been reported for encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and SVV 3C pro -mediated TANK cleavages. Both EMCV and SVV belong to the family Picornaviridae, and although their 3C pro proteins target TANK at a common residue, Q291, SVV also cleaves TANK at another site, E272 (45, 46) . Additional studies should be conducted to determine which part of the 3C pro or 3C-like proteases leads to this difference in cleavage sites. Both arteriviruses and coronaviruses belong to the order Nidovirales. Previous work showed that nsp5 proteins from PEDV and PDCoV, members of the family Coronaviridae, cleave NEMO at a common residue, Q231 (31, 41) . Our research group has verified that another coronavirus nsp5 could target NEMO at Q205 or Q231 (data not shown). However, EAV nsp4 can also cleave NEMO at Q205. This finding suggests that EAV nsp4 is closer to coronavirus nsp5 in evolution than PRRSV nsp4. Whether the evolutionary relationship between these viruses led to their different specific sites of NEMO cleavage by these 3C-like proteases should be studied further.",

Thus, we analyzed the interaction between the protease and substrate motif for Q-E (P2-P1). The results showed that the S1 pocket of EAV nsp4 consisted of three residues, His134, Ser137, and Thr115, whereas only two correspond-ing residues, His133 and Ser136, were found in PRRSV nsp4; thus, the conformation of the S1 pocket differs between EAV nsp4 and PRRSV nsp4 (Fig. 8D and E) . Additionally, Thr113 in PRRSV nsp4 is conserved with Thr115 in EAV nsp4, but Thr113 did not interact with P1 in the complex structure ( Fig. 8A and E) . Our data are similar to those from a previous study on the structure of arterivirus nsp4 (35) . Therefore, we speculate that the different conformations of the S1 pockets of EAV nsp4 and PRRSV nsp4 may lead to P1 being able to accommodate different amino acids. However, the structure of arterivirus nsp4 in complex with substrates remains unclear. Our findings provide a suitable substrate, i.e., NEMO, for further studies on the structure of the arterivirus nsp4 complex. Whether there are any other nsp4 domains besides the S1 pocket that are responsible for different substrate recognition preferences requires further study.",

It has been reported that NEMO-activated IKK\u2423/\u2424 can lead to TBK1/IKK activation by IKK\u2423/\u2424-mediated TBK1/ IKK phosphorylation (47) . NEMO deubiquitinylation impairs NF-B activation (48, 49) . A series of NEMO mutations (E391X, H413R, A323P, and Q157P) was reported to abrogate NF-B activation, verifying that NEMO is a core component in regulating the NF-B pathway (50) . Different viruses can disrupt IFN signaling through interaction with NEMO or NEMO-interacting partners. According to previous studies on NEMO, the N-terminal region of NEMO is responsible for interactions with IKKs, and its C terminus interacts with upstream signaling adaptors and leads to the activation of IKKs (51) . A recent study showed that p.DelQ134-R256, a truncated NEMO mutant that lacks the coiled-coil 1 (CC1) and helix-loop-helix 2 (HLX2) regions, could inhibit NF-B signaling (52) . PEDV and PDCoV 3CL pro proteins target NEMO at Q231 to divide it into two fragments, thereby disrupting NEMO downstream activity (31, 41) . E166, E171, and Q205 are located within coil-coiled domains of NEMO; we verified that the cleavage fragments generated from targeting these three NEMO sites have lost the ability to induce IFN production ( Fig. 6B and C) . This finding indicates that the coil-coiled domains are indispensable for NEMO-induced IFN signaling.",
