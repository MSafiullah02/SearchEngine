            "text": "In considering transgenic technology, the choice of origin of the transgene, i.e., the species the transgene originates from, is an important one. The origin of a transgene may range from prokaryotes (e.g., reporter genes such as \u00df-galactosidase) to worms or flies and higher eukaryotes like man. Human DNA is applied most widely to generate transgenes in experimental biomedical research. This choice offers several advantages. First, from a biomedical viewpoint, many known genetic disorders in humans have been mapped and extensively characterized at the molecular level: mutations or deletions have often been identified and mutant alleles are readily available (1\u20137). This makes it possible to generate transgenic models with \u201cdiseased\u201d alleles and study structure\u2013function relationships in the context of common (mouse) alleles. Second, despite structural divergence, most genes have been well conserved between mouse and man. This may become an important issue when, for instance, the biological activity of the (trans)gene product is dependent on protein\u2013protein interactions or homodimerization. Such interactions may no longer occur between proteins originating from species that have diverged too much during evolution. It is possible that the (trans)gene product alters expression of the mouse homolog, either at a transcriptional, translational, or posttranslational (stability) level. Needless to say, these aspects are important, since they may all affect the outcome of experiments. Third, at a practical level, screening for founder mice generated by pronuclear microinjection, may be difficult when the transgene is also derived from the mouse; the same holds for expressional analysis; such analyses would require quantitation at the DNA and mRNA level, respectively. Structural differences between human and mouse genes make it possible to screen for transgeneity relatively easy. Primary sequence differences, often concentrated in noncoding regions (introns), provide a convenient way to discern between the transgene and the endogenous mouse gene by simple restriction endonucleases analysis. Sequence differences are not necessarily confined to noncoding regions but may also occur in coding regions (exons): the mRNA transcribed from the human transgene and that from the endogenous murine counterpart may differ in size and/or nucleotide composition. The latter may become useful in case size similarity hampers straightforward interpretation. If gene products differ at the amino acid level, Western analysis also presents a means to discriminate between endogenous and transgene-related expression, provided antisera are available that specifically detect the (trans)gene product. Alternatively, discrimination of the transgene-encoded protein can be easily accomplished by adding an epitope to the proteins\u2019 amino acid sequence, such as a synthetic Flag-, multiple Histidine (His), protein-derived tags (i.e., Hemagglutinin (HA), c-myc) or virus-based tag (i.e., V5, PY \u2013 polyoma). In addition, follow-up studies such as immunoprecipitation, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP assay) and protein purification, may significantly benefit from such tags, in case the availability of immunological tools against the transgene product is limiting. Importantly, the effect of tag addition should be evaluated in vitro prior to embarking on in vivo experiments, as the addition of small peptide tags may affect protein function in vivo.",

As holds for the choice of expressional control (see Subheading 1.3), the choice of transgene origin is mostly determined by the aim of the experimental model itself.

If the study of gene function is the aim and overexpression is the experimental approach, a human gene may simply offer a practical solution for screening purposes. In addition, an alternative approach to generate transgenic mice is discussed in 10.1007/978-1-60761-974-1_10.",

It appears important to preserve the intron\u2013exon boundaries at least to some extent in a transgene. The native intron\u2013exon structure of a gene need not be preserved in its entirety though. If the size of a genomic DNA transgene is too large for conventional cloning techniques, combining cDNA sequences with a few genomic intron\u2013exon boundaries may circumvent this problem (see Fig. 1). Inclusion of only one generic intron in a transgene has been shown to augment transgene expression significantly (8, 9).\n",

Often, (part of) the first (noncoding) exon attached to a promoter is used in combination with coding sequences within a transgene; care should be taken that transgene translation starts at the intended ATG, and not in upstream heterologous exon sequences (see Subheading 1.3). Moreover, the effect of including introns in a transgene seems independent of its position within the transcriptional unit, although 3\u2032-positioned splice acceptor and donor sequences have been known to result in aberrant splicing products. These observations suggest that recognition and processing by spliceosomes is instrumental in the observed upregulation of transgene expression. In addition, some endogenous introns appear to harbor regulatory elements with structural and functional similarities to enhancers, Locus control regions (LCRs), or Matrix attachment regions (MARs) (see Subheading 2.2) which direct transgene expression in a position-independent or cell type-specific fashion (9\u201317).",

The promoter region should comprise a Kozak/ATG sequence at which transgene translation commences (see Subheading 1.2; (18)). If the expression pattern of a transgene needs to parallel that of the endogenous mouse gene, one needs to include native regulatory elements. Regulatory elements can be included that augment transgene expression, such as enhancers, which typically act in an orientation-independent manner. MARs, scaffold attachment regions (SARs), and chromosomal insulators are believed to insulate (trans)gene expression from the influences of surrounding chromatin (15). LCRs confer position-independent and copy number-dependent expressional characteristics to a transgene. In addition, LCRs provide transgene expression at physiological levels, often with a cell lineage-specific enhancer activity. The application of LCRs in transgenesis is discussed in detail elsewhere (reviewed in (15)). The advantage of including such elements in transgenes is obvious: whereas transgenes with \u201cminimal\u201d promoters may become inactive by the insertion into transcriptionally silent chromatin, transgenes carrying, for instance, LCRs will not. However, not all endogenous loci contain such elements and most often their position relative to coding regions within the locus is not known. If faithful reproduction of the endogenous expression profile is required (see also Subheading 1.4), without actual knowledge of the position of regulatory element within a transgene, there is obvious advantage in using large DNA segments as transgenes (see Subheading 1.3).",

            "text": "In the early days of transgenesis, it was often difficult to obtain faithful transgene expression patterns, i.e., which parallel expression of their endogenous counterparts, for a number of reasons (e.g., lack of knowledge in regard to nature and location of regulatory sequences of a locus; size restrictions of cloning systems). The use of a full-length relatively small mammalian gene (i.e., 15\u201320 kb), including 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 and internal regulatory regions, may yield faithful transgene expression patterns. In such a fortunate situation, not only coding sequences, but also cell lineage-specific and other regulatory elements are located within or close to the intron\u2013exon structure of a locus. However, the exact location of elements that exert transcriptional control over a (trans)gene of interest need not always be known and often there may be many kb removed from the actual transcriptional start site. For a number of applications, like genetic complementation of large deletions and gene therapy, it is imperative to include such regulatory features in a transgene (19\u201321). Fortunately, when transgenes become too large (i.e., up to 100\u2013150 kb) for \u201cconventional\u201d plasmid-based cloning, a number of modern cloning techniques have overcome this hurdle: one needs to resort to cloning systems employing P1 artificial chromosomes (PAC), yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC), or bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) (see 10.1007/978-1-60761-974-1_9). In addition, other cloning methodologies have been described to generate plasmids for biotechnology purposes, such as recombineering (see 10.1007/978-1-60761-974-1_11). In principle, any gene can be cloned into these systems. Exceedingly large YACs (>500 kb) are transferred into embryonic stem cells first and via this route used to generate transgenic mice (see 10.1007/978-1-60761-974-1_9). An obvious and important advantage of using large stretches of genomic DNA is that with these systems the chances of obtaining cell lineage-specific, integration site-independent, and copy number-dependent expression characteristics are greatly improved (22, 23).",

            "text": "If overexpression or ectopic expression is required, general type heterologous promoters (e.g., such as widely applied viral promoters) and/or enhancers are widely used. The use of heterologous and autologous (i.e., endogenous to the gene in interest) regulatory elements is often combined (see for example Figs. 1 and 3). The very first transgenic mouse models generated made use of the general-type metallothioneine promoter (pMT) (24, 26\u201328). This promoter was used to control expression of human, rat, or viral transgenes and, although showing a relatively high level of basal expression, proved to be further inducible with glucocorticoids, heavy metals, or bacterial endotoxin (LPS) (29, 30). The use of heterologous promoters and other regulatory elements has become wide spread, and as indicated before, is determined primarily by the aim of the animal model (see Fig. 2). To ensure global and ubiquitous expression of a particular transgene, general-type promoters, such as those derived from histones, \u00df-actin, or housekeeping genes (e.g., phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK)), but also viral promoters are often applied. Needless to say, if a heterologous promoter is chosen to drive transgene expression, one should adhere to those promoters that have been proven to function in vivo, or thoroughly test the novel system first. In the latter case, the experimenter should realize that in vitro expression characteristics of novel promoters may be very different than those in vivo. It is therefore strongly recommended to test novel promoters in vivo before use in a transgenic animal model.\n",

            "text": "\nAside from promoter choice, the overall structure of a transgene has considerable influence on its activity. In eukaryotes, foreign DNA sequences (e.g., viral DNA, transgenes) are often methylated and inactivated as part of a host defense system against transcription of potentially harmful genes (39\u201341). Although the exact mechanisms by which (trans)genes are transcriptionally silenced are not clear on all aspects, the presence of prokaryotic sequences (i.e., plasmid) should be minimized in a transgenic construct (the strategy (i.e., restriction sites) by which the transgene is released from plasmid sequences is a crucial part of the transgene design). In addition, it appears that the presence of bona fide intron\u2013exon structures in a transgene circumvents some of these problems (see Subheading 1.2).Expression of the transgene may be low in several independent animal lines or not detectable at all. Although this may indicate a flaw in the design of the construct, it is possible, that the (trans)gene product causes embryonic death: transgene (over)expression interferes with normal embryogenesis. In the latter case, the use of different regulatory sequences should be considered (see Subheadings 1.3 and 1.4). To rule out poor construct design, it is strongly recommended to evaluate the biological activity (i.e., basic expression) of a transgene and the size of the transgenic mRNA in cultured cells (e.g., by transient transfection or electroporation and subsequent Northern analysis).High copy number insertions are often associated with a significant decrease in transgene expression as a result of silencing (42\u201344), most likely because these are perceived as repeats in the mammalian genome. The presence of regulatory elements that confer position independent and copy number dependent transgene expression, may circumvent this problem. Occasionally, insertion as inverted repeats may also affect transgene activity (29).An inserted transgene may affect the expression of (nearby) endogenous genes, which influences the phenotype in an unforeseen manner. Transgene insertion may cause haplo-insufficiency, or when integrated in an imprinted locus or in a gene on the X-chromosome, it may even cause a null-mutant phenotype, entirely unrelated to the intended model. To ascribe a certain phenotype to transgene activity, it is therefore imperative to include more than one independent transgenic line in the studies, as is standardly done for ES cell-mediated genetic manipulation in mice.Although without doubt more involving than conventional transgenesis, it is possible to study the behavior of recessive mutations in mice, by overexpression at supra-physiological levels (18). Alternatively, a (conditional) knockin for the mutation may be generated, or the transgenic lines may be backcrossed to a (conditional) knockout for the endogenous gene (19).In our experience, the slightest impurities will have a serious impact on the efficiency with which transgenic founders are generated. Often times, residual Ethidium Bromide is a source of trouble. Traces Ethidium Bromide in a DNA preparation is easily detected on an agarose gel from which Ethidium Bromide has been omitted. If DNA is detectable in this fashion, the preparation should be reextracted with Phenol-chloroform-isoamylalcohol a number of times.Manipulation of DNA, that is to be used to generate transgenic animals via pronuclear injection, should be done with utmost care: shield DNA as much as possible from UV-light (i.e., day light, UV-light box) when in the presence of Ethidium Bromide, since DNA can be damaged and mutated as a result. Working surfaces and equipment (UV tray; scalpels) are clean when isolating fragments from agarose gels.Since DNA for microinjection needs to be extremely pure, it is not precipitated with coprecipitants. Moreover, some coprecipitants, like Dextran T-500 (Pharmacia), for instance, are toxic to zygotes.Elutip-D purification is a convenient method to purify DNA for pronuclear injection (see 10.1007/978-1-60761-974-1_2). Yields are not very high (loading capacity column), but the DNA obtained is ultrapure. As an alternative to Elutip-D purification, dialysis against TE-buffer for microinjection is often used. However, care should be taken that the materials used are absolutely free of soap and other contaminants, since these substances have a strongly negative effect on the survival of injected fertilized eggs.\n",

Depending on the nature of the animal model and its specific application, there are numerous choices in as far as the regulation of transgene expression is concerned; such regulatory control may comprise more than a promoter only (see Subheading 1.3). (1) Eukaryotic regulatory sequences may be derived from the gene of interest, i.e., autologous (see Subheading 1.3) or from a different gene. (2) The required expression profile may be systemic or tissue specific (see Subheadings 1.3 and 1.4); alternatively (over)expression in all tissues may be achieved with more general promoters. (3) Finally, specific animal models or embryonic lethality may dictate the need for an inducible expression system (see Subheading 1.4). Regulatory sequences of viral origin are widely used to drive transgene expression and frequently confer tissue-specific expression characteristics to a transgene.",

The Philadelphia chromosome, the hallmark of this clinical type of leukemia, results from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. As a result, the BCR locus and the ABL locus become joined. The genomic ABL locus itself is more than 200 kb in size, the first intron spanning approximately 175 kb. Breakpoints within the ABL locus are known to occur relatively 5\u2032 within the first intron. The transgene harbors a heterologous (see Subheading 1.4) general-type metallothioneine promoter (24). The first BCR exon plus part of the first intron, which is fused (open arrow) to a short part of the first ABL introns and the second ABL exon, provide a splice donor (SD) and a splice acceptor (SA) site and preserve a simple but truthful mammalian intron\u2013exon structure (see Subheading 1.2); an additional SD/SA pair comes from the ABL exon 2/intron 2 and intron 2/exon 3 boundaries. The main body of ABL exons, which spans about 32 kb, was cloned into the transgene as a cDNA segment. In this configuration, the transgene spans a mere 10 kb. Above illustration is adapted after (25).",
