The North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (NATO) (an intergovernmental military alliance between 29 members including North American and European countries), developed a Multinational Telemedicine System in 2000 that has been deployed with their military forces during various crises.5 Through solutions such as person-deployable portable telemedicine kits and satellite linkage, areas in need have received health support from medical experts located in other countries.6 During hurricanes Harvey and Irma,7 private telemedicine companies provided care to victims relocated from their homes and primary care providers. Following the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2003, China began exploring telehealth and integrated electronic medical systems for use in similar situations in the future.8 During severe prolonged droughts in Australia, the health department introduced new funding through the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) to allow clinicians to provide additional mental health services via videoconferencing.9 In 2019, similar mental health services were also offered to people affected by the bushfires.9",

Embedding telehealth into routine service delivery, by all healthcare providers, is the most effective way of ensuring telehealth can be readily used during emergencies. This requires operational telehealth networks, telehealth policies and procedures, and technology infrastructure that can be scaled-up during times of disaster. Telehealth is a disruptive process, so there is a need for effective change-management strategies to support clinicians with limited telehealth experience. Furthermore, simulated testing of telehealth applications for emergency situations is also a useful way of ensuring that workflow processes are clear and effective.29",

Advantages of telehealth include the ability to: rapidly deploy large numbers of providers; facilitate triage so that front-line providers are not overwhelmed with new presentations; supply clinical services when local clinics or hospitals are damaged or unable to meet demand; and decrease the risk of communicable diseases which are transmitted by person-to-person contact.",
