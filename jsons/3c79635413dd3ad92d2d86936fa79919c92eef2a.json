This paper presents a review of the service robots in medicine with an emphasis on service robots for disinfection in medical institutions. It is shown and described how more and more disinfectant service robots are contributing to a very simple, fast and effective disinfection in medical institutions. Work of the service robot with all necessary components for its function as well as its good and bad sides are in details elaborated and clarified. The aim is to demonstrate the application and use these service robots in medical institutions. Use of these service robots reduces the risk of infection, cost of traditional cleaning and disinfection, and most importantly acquires confidence and security in medical facilities.",

It is mostly MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), C. diff. (Clostridium difficile), VRE (Vancomycin-resistant enterococci) and of new pathogens such as MERS (respiratory syndrome). These microorganisms are resistant to antibiotics, and commonly referred to as \"superbugs\". As a result of infection by these pathogens often involve considerable pain and suffering and many deaths. These infections are major problems and significant costs of modern health sector. Cleaning and disinfection are expensive and are not effective enough due to inaccessible areas. Since there is no way to force people to disinfect hands remains to introduce robots to disinfect [1] .",

Niels Finsen was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1903 for being the first to use \"light therapy\" to treat disease with direct disinfection of skin. By the 1930s, UV had come into common use throughout hospitals for air and water treatment and by WWII, UV was in widespread use in processing plants, water treatment facilities, and anywhere microbial contamination was a concern. UV gained fame in the 1950s for helping to eradicate TB before fading in use in the 1960s with the proliferation of antibiotics and chemical disinfectants [2, 3] . Now with the current focus on solving the crisis of rising multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs), healthcare acquired infections (HAIs), and treatment costs, UV has once again risen to the top of the list in the war against superbugs. After 100 years in healthcare use, UV has found a new application in hospitals providing surface disinfection of patient rooms, bathrooms, operating rooms (ORs), equipment rooms, and mobile devices [4] .",

Additionally, photo crosslinking causes cell wall damage and can cause cell lysis, an irreversible form of cell death. Disinfecting across the entire spectrum helps prevent pathogens from repairing themselves [11] (Fig. 7) . There are cheaper ways to generate disinfecting UV light. For example, mercury lamps have been used to disinfect surfaces and liquids for decades, and the bulbs are only about $100. However, they are 25,000 times less intense than a Xenon bulb and the disinfection process can take hours, making them impractical for hospital use. LEDs could also provide cheaper UV light, but they are also far less intense than Xenon bulbs, according to Hart [5, 11] (Fig. 8) .",

UVC disinfection may add to the armamentarium against HAI's without risking the adaptive genetic resistance incurred by pharmaceutical weapons. Implementation including training personnel to operate the device is minimal, and time spent cleaning was not increased. Because there were separate cycles for bathroom and living room, the surface reduction in aerobic colony counts may be better than with other UV systems; a head-to-head comparison of UV area disinfection devices may be warranted.",
