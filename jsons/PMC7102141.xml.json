Recent observations indicate that the clinical profile of dengue is changing, and that neurological and other atypical manifestations are being reported more frequently [2\u20136]. There are very few reports available in the literature highlighting clinical course and management of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) in dengue infection. The authors present 2 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever to highlight clinical features and management of these complications.",
