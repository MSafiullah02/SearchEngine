We hear and read about the UN Climate Change Conferences, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the WHO, de European Academies\u2014Science Advisory Council and other supranational bodies speaking out on the effects of global warming and the urgency for action. There is growing public discontent with national governments implementing mitigation and adaptation strategies, as we witness the wildfires from California to Australia, from Siberia to the Amazon and the floods in Mozambique and other countries. The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is undeniably related to the climate crisis. We have known for some time that global warming is increasing the likelihood, the timing, the intensity and geography of zoonoses, epidemics and other public health threats via a web of intertwined causal pathways [6]. Factors such as globalization, population density, latitude, human behaviour, cultural habits, prosperity, land use, migration or conflict contribute to the prevalence and incidence of these infectious diseases that affect human health, animal health and environmental health. There is still much unknown or is \u2018known unknown\u2019.",

One reason for this is the mounting evidence for the impact on individual and population health.

Substantial investment has not been made to adapt our economies to future circumstances. Global warming, decreased biodiversity, water and air pollution are already causing health problems and increasing mortality across the planet. These effects have presented themselves faster and more dramatically than expected, with most impact on the vulnerable and most disadvantaged people. This has resulted in increased mortality and incidence of climate-related zoonoses, heat stress, more asthma and allergies, with resultant loss of labour productivity. For the near future, we can anticipate increased cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, as well as mental ill health, besides the health consequences of food insecurity, water shortage, climate migration or territorial conflict.",

In addition, the healthcare industry must examine its own carbon footprint, as it is in itself contributing to climate change through greenhouse gases emission, waste and pharmaceutical pollution. Climate change and its impact is the new public health challenge and has become a major determinant of health. The prevailing paradigm of medicine is challenged by what is called \u2018the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century\u2019 [10]. The global COVID-19 outbreak is only one example of this. Firstly, we must combat this crisis. Now it is time for health professionals to act decisively and collaborate for a transition in order to prevent its causes. Since climate change also presents \u2018the greatest global opportunity of the 21st century\u2019 this transition entails an opening for hopeful, innovative and positive action as well [11].",

This marked a historical and unique opportunity for the International Society to recognize the relationship between climate change, health and health care quality and act accordingly. Climate change can only be moderated by a series of global measures, the first of which is shifting away from global fossil-fuel dependency in order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. The healthcare sector could contribute substantially to this goal since its contribution to global carbon dioxide emission is estimated to be the equivalent of 514 coal plants; 4.4% of the global net emission [13]. High-resource countries generally pollute much more than low-resource countries.",

Reducing the environmental footprint of our work and improving sustainability can in fact be viewed as quality improvement activities. For instance, substituting the use of severely polluting anaesthetic gases in anaesthesiology with equally safe and effective intravenous drugs drastically reduces the footprint of the operating theatre [14]. The use of telemedicine in epilepsy care reduces travelling of patients and thereby substantially lowers carbon dioxide emission [15]. In nephrology, efforts are undertaken to reduce the use of energy and water in haemodialysis [16]. Decreasing the use of plastics, decreasing the use of water and energy are all within the realm of most facilities. Many more examples and best practices are there to promote circular work (\u2018reduce, reuse, recycle\u2019) of disposables and medical devices or reduce pollution by medicines, thereby improving quality of care by improving its ecological footprint [17].",
