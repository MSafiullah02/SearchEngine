            "text": "Although governments of Hajji\u2019s countries of origin recommend flu vaccinations for Hajj pilgrimages before departure, most hajjis do not adhere to these recommendations. Influenza vaccine has been recommended since 2005 for all pilgrims, especially people at high risk, which includes those >65 years of age and people with preexisting medical or immune-compromising conditions.14 Despite all these recommendations, the influenza vaccine acceptance rate among Hajj pilgrims varies by country and by year. Many pilgrims refuse vaccines; the main reasons identified were reliance on \u201cnatural immunity,\u201d lack of awareness or knowledge, and lack of access to vaccines. Many people have misperceptions about vaccines, including that they contain toxic preservatives and are themselves the cause of disease. Moreover these vaccinations do not cover variants of different strains of influenza. According to Alborzi et al.,13 in their study on Iranian Hajj pilgrims, influenza vaccination could not prevent respiratory infections in pilgrims statistically (P = .19), but the consequences of this limitation remains less. Two hundred fifty-five pilgrims were examined for respiratory infections, and influenza virus was identified more in unvaccinated than in vaccinated pilgrims (16.5% vs 9.2%) in laboratory tests of their nasal swabs.13 Another study among Malaysian pilgrims found that influenza vaccine was effective for 50%-60% in preventing hospitalization and pneumonia; it was 80% effective in preventing death in patients older than age 60.15 Eventual vaccination failures might be explained by a new drift of variants or inappropriate vaccine handling and storage.\u2217\nTherefore examining the circulating influenza strains is recommended in addition to strict enforcement of vaccination policy.13, 15 Among other precautionary measures, the use of a face mask is considered by some pilgrims religiously prohibited while wearing ihram. Some consider using alcohol-containing products (eg, hand sanitizers) as prohibited during Hajj ritual too, although recently religious scholars have allowed the use of alcohol for medical purposes. However, the challenge remains to endorse use of mandatory face masks in the crowd and organize screening at arrival.9 The Saudi government faces extreme pressure during the time of Hajj because there are multiple routes of entry for pilgrims.16 Therefore it is recommended to enforce the law on compulsory vaccinations and control for dishonesty and corruption by the home countries as prerequisites for visa processing. Also, a supply of adequate vaccines at limited or no cost is strongly suggested.14\n",

According to Madani et al,19 more than 60% of the intensive care unit admissions in 7 hospitals in Mina and Arafat were due to cardiovascular origins. Among these cases, myocardial infarction and left ventricular failure were of the highest occurrence.19 Furthermore, cardiovascular events were the major cause of death during pilgrimage. The review study of Al Shimemeri25 confirmed that cardiovascular diseases during the Hajj period caused more death than other communicable and noncommunicable diseases. In 2008, 66% of deaths were due to cardiovascular diseases out of 446 deaths among Indonesian pilgrims.26\n",

This sacred ritual was hijacked as a business opportunity by broker agencies of developing countries, infested with corruption, dishonesty, and greed to make profit from pilgrims. Implementation and enforcement of law from both the custodian country and sending countries were found to be weak in several aspects. Notwithstanding the custodian country\u2019s adoption of various recent research insights, techniques, and models to enhance security and safety, and arrangement of relevant annual conferences and capacity-building initiatives, a significant gap was found between planned and actual implementation strategies. A discriminatory and judgmental attitude of the custodian country officials was encountered toward pilgrims from developing countries.",

Many recent incidences and risks of morbidity and mortality suggest that it is not the sole responsibility of one country but should be attributed to all home countries of pilgrims. Especially to meet the challenge of infectious diseases, a well-coordinated global approach is priority. Epidemiological modeling at the microscopic level is suggested by many researchers and already monitored in other mass gatherings, such as Notting Hill Carnival. Dishonesty related to vaccination and treatment ultimately endangers the whole world as illustrated in the literature. Henceforth international collaboration, law enforcement, and research are vital to ensure accessibility of vaccines and prescribed medications for the pilgrims. Capacity building within host and sending countries focusing on prevention of infectious disease, heat-related sicknesses, and injuries before Hajj are important and should be adopted worldwide. Hajj causalities data should be shared accurately; and the custodian country should welcome global participation and deal with criticism in a constructive way. Furthermore, an international event of this magnitude such as the Hajj creates communication challenges. To minimize language barriers, law enforcers must be proficient in English, and written instructions or directions should make use of main global languages.29\n",
