            "text": "The most striking exception known to non-overlapping sequential triplet decoding (1) is in a phage T4 gene next to that used by Crick et al (1961) to establish the general nature of genetic readout. This nearby gene, gene 60, derives from insertion of a mobile DNA cassette consisting of a homing endonuclease gene and an associated separate 50 nt sequence that provides protection against self-cleavage (2). The insert occurred into an ancestral phage T4 topoisomerase encoding gene. The inserted endonuclease gene split the original gene into two genes. Both genes are functional despite the 3' gene having a 50 nt insert between codons 46 and 47 of its coding sequence (3) . The insert has stop codons in all frames, suggesting that translation of this sequence would result in a prematurely terminated protein. Studies with plasmid-borne cassettes showed that in Escherichia coli grown on rich media, a substantial proportion of translating ribosomes successfully bypass the 50 nt coding gap to synthesize a single protein from two discontinuous open reading frames (ORFs) (4, 5) . Moreover, bypassing can also occur with rare codons in highly expressed genes upon heterologous expression (6) , with unassigned codons (7) , and even in unstarved cells (8). Limitation of aminoacyl-tRNA for a \"hungry\" A-site sense codon induces low level bypassing (9) (10) (11) .",

Changes in the nascent peptide starting from the crucial 14 KKYK 17 motif resulted in substantial reduction in bypassing efficiency. In vitro studies that systematically scanned the effect of nascent peptide mutations have shown that mutations of residues 14-30 in the nascent peptide sequence reduce bypassing efficiency by 2 to 20-fold (23, 31) . The nascent peptide adopts an \u03b1-helical conformation and forms multiple interactions with both rRNA and protein components of the interior of the peptide exit tunnel of the ribosome (22) . Nascent peptide-exit tunnel interactions cause progressive ribosome slowing, as the ribosome approaches the take-off codon, enabling ribosomes to adopt an unusual hyper-rotated conformation prior to bypassing (21, 23) . The nascent peptide interaction also helps the ribosome to retain peptidyl-tRNA during bypassing (31, 32) and serves to increase the accuracy of peptidyl-tRNA re-pairing to mRNA (20, 33) .",

The in vitro translation system (22, 23, 31) was primed with gene 60 mRNA whose non-bypass product (ORF1 translation product) was 46 amino acids (~5 kDa) and the full-length bypassing product was 160 amino acids (~17.6 kDa). The set-up for in vitro translation by monosomes involved mixing initiation ribosome complexes (to final concentration 0.016 \u00b5M) with the ternary complexes (50 \u00b5M). Translation by polysomes was carried out in the same way but in the presence of additional ribosomal subunits, initiation factors and Bpy-Met-tRNA fMet to allow for reinitiation on the same mRNA. Upon translation by a single ribosome, the non-bypass i.e ORF1, product accumulates after about 10 s and then decreases, because about 60% of ribosomes bypass and synthesize the bypass product ( Fig. 4B and Fig. S3C) . A similar J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f accumulation of the ORF1 product is observed for the leading ribosome in the polysome ( Fig. 4B and Fig. S3C ). In the conditions of high ribosomal loading (polysome) the bypass product is formed slower in comparison with mono ribosome translation (Fig. 4C) , which suggests that even the leading ribosome has difficulties to land. When the leading ribosome leaves the take-off codon, trailing ribosomes in the polysome complete synthesis of the ORF1 product, but cannot complete bypassing, which leads to accumulation of the non-bypass product (Fig. 4B) . Although the level of bypassing product increases in polysomes, (Fig. 4C) , the fraction of ribosomes that complete bypassing is smaller than by a monosome (Fig. 4D ).",

An extraordinarily high proportion of the ribosome-protected fragments in ribosome profiling derived from ribosomes stalled at the take-off codon; in agreement with earlier studies that showed ribosome pausing at the takeoff site (21, 22) . There were essentially two sizes of protected RNA, 37 nts and 53 nts. The 37 nt fragment is within the upper part of the size range of standard protected fragments found with ribosomes carrying out canonical translation. However, as extrapolated from the protection pattern of ribosomes in canonical rotation states, the 53-nt fragment is unusually long. If 15 nt 5' of the P site/A site junction are located in the mRNA channel, the 5' SL top could form outside the ribosome, whereas the 3' side of the stem would reside within the mRNA exit channel. On this basis, it is surprising, that the 5' nt of the protected 53 nt fragment coincides exactly with the 5' nt of the 5' SL. However, formation of the SL involving the 3' side of the stem is highly unlikely, as it is occluded by the mRNA channel andgiven the structure of the channela double-stranded SL is too bulky to fit into it.",

Rather, the observed protection could be explained in two possible ways. One possibility is that the 5'SL top and the mRNA region up to the take-off codon is protected in a canonical way, due to formation of the SL and protection by the ribosome, respectively, whereas the 5' part of the 5' SL is inaccessible for RNase cleavage due to the hyper-rotated conformation of the ribosome. Another possibility is that the parts of the 5'SL that are out of the 30S subunit interact with the ribosome or with the upstream elements of the mRNA, thereby preventing the RNase J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 20 cleavage. This possibility is supported by the cryoEM analysis of ribosomes stalled at the take-off codon revealing density for the structured mRNA 5' of the 30S (22) . Earlier SHAPE analysis showed that the 5' SL can form in the absence of ribosomes (26) . That work showed that the two bases in the 5'SL closing loop and two bases between the 5' SL and the extended SL, which were highly accessible to the SHAPE reagent and to Tb 3+ . These potential (Table S4) . Given the relative instability of the lower stem due to its shorter sequence and rapid fraying from NMR, the primary contribution of the lower 5' SL structure may be to extend the top aspect of the structure to potential interacting partners. The 5' SL's highly dynamic nature agrees with previous findings that the density for the 5'SL region is disordered in the cryoEM study of ribosomes paused at the take-off site (22) .",

It is also possible that the proximity to the bypassing ribosome of its closest trailing ribosome, which is performing continued translation, negatively impacts the pseudotranslocation, e.g., by J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 23 preventing formation of the hyper-rotated state. The results add to emerging appreciation of the importance of case-specific ribosome loading levels for recoding (45) (46) (47) , as well as elsewhere such as neuronal decoding (48) . This highlights the need, at least in recoding studies, to express cassettes under different loading conditions to avoid missing important stimulatory signals and for ascertaining physiologically relevant efficiencies.",

Similarly, 1D exchangeable 1 H spectra, which only detected UH3 and GH1 nuclei participating in hydrogen bonds due to base pairing, indicated two AU pairs, five GC pairs, and one GU pair. The missing AU pair corresponding to the terminal AU of the bottom stem was detected from the 5' SLGC spectra due to addition of the stabilizing terminal GC pair. Assignments of UH3 and GH1 nuclei in the 1D spectra were corroborated by1 H-1 H NOESY experiments, which served to connect adjacent UH3 and GH1 in the top and bottom stems. Nucleotides not involved in base pairing, such as those in the purine-rich inner loop and the terminal loop, were not detected in these experiments due to rapid imino 1 H exchange in these regions. Thus, the 1D 1 H and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f riboses within the top and bottom stems. These connections were rarely found in the flexible internal and terminal loops. NOESY mixing times controlled the maximum internuclear distance that could be detected in the experiment. 50, 150, and 300 ms mixing times corresponded to distances of approximately 3, 5, and 6 \u00c5, respectively, so comparisons between NOESY spectra of different mixing times assisted chemical shift assignment. Since the intensity of a NOESY crosspeak inversely correlated with the sixth power of the internuclear distance at shorter mixing times in the absence of spin diffusion, the internuclear distance was indirectly measured by the NOESY experiments. Two-dimensional through-bond DQF-COSY experiments also delivered conformational information in the form of dihedral angles according to Karplus relationships with 3 J HH coupling. Ribose sugar pucker conformation was probed through 3 J H1'H2' couplings. Intense COSY signals corresponded to a C3'-endo sugar pucker common in A-form RNA helices, while weak signals indicated a C2'-endo conformation. Within the 5' SL model, the 18 nt of the top and bottom stems had strong 3 J H1'H2' couplings, which were interpreted as C2'-endo ribose conformations. To aid 1 H resonance assignments, heteronuclear NMR experiments were required, taking advantage of the broader chemical shift dispersion of 13 C and 15 N resonances. Threedimensional NOESYHSQC experiments provided an additional heteronuclear dimension with which to distinguish similar 1 Hs. 13 C chemical shifts distinguished C1' nuclei from the other ribose carbons, and purine C8 and adenine C2 nuclei were marked by characteristic chemical shifts. 15 N chemical shifts also allowed connections to be made between the ribose J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f for partial alignment. From a comparison of these spectra, 19 differences in H2-C2 Jcoupling, \u0394 1 J CH values, were measured. Average \u0394 1 J CH values for the lower helix, internal loop, upper helix, and terminal loop were 18.24\u00b14.69, 23.90\u00b15.72, 23.15\u00b110.87, and 5.03\u00b11.91, respectively. \u0394 1 J CH values provided long-range conformational data used in structural modeling. Structure Modeling: Data from the NMR experiments were used in structural modeling in the following ways. 143 internuclear distances were calculated from the NOESY crosspeak intensity and calibrated to the pyrimidine H5-H6 crosspeak intensity and known internuclear distance. 18 dihedral angle constraints were collected from COSY 3 J HH coupling constants. 8 base-planarity constraints were applied from the strong base pairing data of the exchangeable",

Since the 5'SL is dynamic, as indicated by the NMR, the lifetime of the open conformation accessible for cleavage may be too short for the RNase, but sufficient for the chemical probing reagents.Paradoxically, although we collected and analysed fragments of up to 150 nts, we did not detect protection of 23-nts 3' from the take-off codon. Inclusion of 23 nts would be expected if the A-site SL were present in the great majority of the ribosomes paused at the Asite, and if the ribosome hyper-rotated state at take-off, or dynamic properties of the A-site SL does not permit MNase to enter the A-site and cleave the A-site SL structure. While the A-site SL was detected both by cryo EM analysis and smFRET, the former used temperature trapping and the smFRET analysis showed that the A-site SL only briefly formed(21), with recent work providing consistent results(23). So it remains possible that the protected fragment being considered derives from ribosomes in which the A-site SL had not yet formed. Though the smFRET study showed that landing/coding resumption is a slow process(21), for unknown reasons possibly related to susceptibility of the mRNA in the vacant A-site J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f The NMR analysis shows that the 5' SL can adopt a compact structure, but remains highly flexible. The top and bottom helices, although rigid and highly stable individually, are weakened by the existence of a connecting loop. This purine-rich internal loop contributes to flexibility not only through fraying of the two helices but also by acting as a hinge that terminal loop nucleobases into the solvent enables intermolecular base pairing, such as that observed in kissing hairpins. The positioning of the 5' SL during takeoff raises the question whether the ribosome itself could interact with the terminal loop either through protein-RNA or RNA-RNA interactions. However, disruption of terminal loop interactions through synonymous codon mutations of the loop sequence did not affect bypassing. Moreover, it is unclear exactly how much of the 5' SL sequence is free to fold during takeoff. The upper helix and the terminal loop alone comprise of a modestly stable hairpin. Although mutations designed to restore the 5' stem-loop do not substantially restore bypassing levels (Fig. 4 and 5) one possible contributory explanation for this observation could be altered elongation rates at mutant codons with lower codon usage",

While the context for gene 60 translation initiation is relatively strong [(U)GAGG-6nts-AUG], its initiation level is likely influenced by overlapping translation of an upstream coding sequence and physiological state of the cell at the time of infection (2). Under polysome conditions, behind the leading ribosome proximity of the mRNA entrance channel of the closest trailing ribosome has potential to prevent nucleotides emerging from the leading ribosome from forming the 5' SL. While this could account for part of the lower bypassing efficiency under polysome than under monosome conditions, it cannot be the sole reason. Under polysome",

From these parameters, 400 structures were generated from repeated simulated annealing using the RNA-ff1 force field. For the complete 5' SL sequence model, the same procedurewas used incorporating 143 NOE distance constraints, 18 dihedral angle constraints, and 18 base-planarity constraints from NMR experiments of 5' SL and 5' SLGC. 200 structures were generated, and the 20 structures with the lowest energies were selected.

Resulting initiation complexes were purified by centrifugation through a 1.1 M sucrose cushion in the same buffer. The ternary complex EF-Tu-GTP-aminoacyl-tRNA was prepared by incubating EF-Tu (58 \u00b5M) with GTP (1 mM), phosphoenol pyruvate (3 mM) and pyruvate kinase (0.1 mg/mL) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C, then adding purified total aa-tRNA (about 60 \u00b5M) and EF-G (2 \u00b5M) and incubating for 1 min at 37\u00b0C. In vitro translation by monosomes was started by mixing initiation ribosome complexes (to final concentration 0.016 \u00b5M) with the ternary complexes (50 \u00b5M). Translation was carried out at 37\u00b0C for different time intervals from 3 s to 1200 s.

These were cloned into the vector CRC01 Weak SD vector or CRC01 Strong SD vector. It was previously confirmed the CRC01 Strong SD vector displays a higher ribosome load per message from polysome fractions when compared to the CRC01 Weak SD vector (45). The low ribosome vector used did not as completely restrict loading as that of another vector whose results are not shown because of artifacts associated with generation of the severe restriction.

Once an OD of 0.4-0.5 was reached, the cultures were induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-\u03b2, D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 1 hr at their respective temperatures. After induction, cultures were incubated on ice for 10 min. After induction, cultures were incubated on ice for 10 mins and the OD was noted. Cells were lysed by resuspension in 2x laemmli sample buffer (based on OD) and were incubated for a further 30 min on ice.

Equivalent amounts of proteins were diluted and boiled for 10 min at 95\u00b0C.Proteins were separated by Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Protran). Immunoblots were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight in 5% milk/phosphate buffered saline-Tween containing a 1:5000 dilution of mouse anti-His conjugated to a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. efficiency was determined by taking the amount of byp product as a ratio of the total amount of stop plus byp products.
