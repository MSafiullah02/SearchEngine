            "text": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is caused by a viral infection, the virus belongs to a large family of viruses called genus Beta coronavirus (CoV) [1]. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-COV) is a zoonotic illness, infecting both humans and animals (camels and bats). Only two strains of coronaviruses were found to infect humans: MERS-CoV and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome whereas different species of animals are infected by several strains of corona viruses [2]. The MERS-CoV causes upper respiratory disease in human being, which ranges from mild to moderate [3]. In September 2012, the MERS-CoV was identified in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) as a first public case [4]. The first nosocomial outbreak of MERS-CoV was reported in Al Zarqa, Jordan (eight healthcare workers) [5]. Subsequently, 2189 cases (782 deaths) of MERS-COV around the world were reported to World Health Organization from September 2012 to March 2018. Of 2189 cases worldwide, KSA reported 1814 cases (708 deaths) to WHO. Approximately 27 countries around the world have reported cases of MERS-CoV. Such countries included KSA, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Bahrain, Lebanon, Egypt, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, France, Germany, Austria, Algeria, Greece, Islamic Republic of Iran, China, Republic of Korea, Tunisia, Thailand, Malaysia, Italy, the Netherlands, and Philippines [6]. According to published studies, Arabian Peninsula has mainly represented the geographic distribution of the MERS-CoV cases, however, KSA was reported the highest percentage of cases [[7], [8], [9], [10]]. In some countries that located in Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America, they reported that the MERS-COV was detected in people coming from endemic countries [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]].",

However, the mode of transmission from camels to human is not completely known. In term of transmission from humans to humans, the virus does not simply transmit between humans except if there is close contact, for example, touching the patient hands.

Donnelly et al, 2019 stated \u2018although 739 cases were reported in 2014 and 768 cases in 2015, only 244 cases were reported in 2016, another 244 in 2017, and 113 through September 2018. They assessed potential components of this reduction (i.e., reduction of community-acquired cases, human-to-human transmission cases, or both). The incidence of community-acquired cases was 177 in 2016, 151 in 2017, and 86 through September 2018. This means community prevalence is decreasing as well as survival rates are increasing. The author believe that affected countries are reducing the global threat of MERS through addressing knowledge gaps with regard to transmission, enhancing surveillance, and strengthening the ability to detect cases early and contain hospital outbreaks. The authors suggest that the reduction in cases has been achieved through improved infection prevention and control measures that are reducing human-to-human transmission. In addition, restriction of camel movement, stronger and more comprehensive investigations of cases and clusters at the time outbreaks are detected, and increased communication nationally and internationally have been critical in preventing international spread and sustained transmission [37].",

First, the study design is a retrospective and was relied on chart review with some inherited issues; these involve missing data with respect the time course (from illness onset to hospital admission, diagnosis, death, and discharge from hospital). Second, some positive MERS-CoV cases might be sent from non-referral or private hospitals in our region to referral hospitals out Najran such as King Abdullah Medical Complex in Jeddah or Prince Muhammad bin Abdul Aziz Hospital in Riyadh; or mild cases may not come to our referral hospital, for these reasons, our study might have a selection bias. Although these limitations, we were able to identify the demographic, clinical outcomes of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, and associated factors with mortality in Najran region, KSA.",

The case fatality rate dropped over five years to reach 15 % in 2018, and therefore, other studies are recommended to study MERS-CoV antibodies in different community classes to assess herd immunity whether it is the reason behind increasing the survival rate.",
