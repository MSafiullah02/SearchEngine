            "text": "Blended learning is the new educational kid on the block (Bliuc et al., 2007) and in the context of pandemic Covid-19 it is suddenly paramount to education. Internationally, we have seena move towards blended learning in major tertiary institutions, including those offering nursing education. New Zealand's tertiary education pre-registration Bachelor of Nursing (BN) programmes, for example, have been quick to develop blended learning approaches to meet the technological and practical learning needs of students (Meyer et al., 2014) . Some tertiary education institutions in New Zealand are accredited to offer nursing programmes at sites that are separate from the main campus and these exist as 'satellite campuses' (Nursing Council of New Zealand, 2015) . Covid-19 and resulting global emergency lockdowns have instigated a sudden need for learning to be blended across professions and institutions internationally. At no time in history has there been such a massive sudden transition towards blended learning. Indeed, the proof manuscript of this article was made available to the authors on day one of New Zealand's national emergency lockdown (26 March 2020). Staker and Horn (2012) define blended learning as \"a formal education programme in which a student learns at least in part through online delivery of content and instruction with some element of student control over time, place, path and/or pace; and at least in part at a supervised brick-and-mortar location away from home\" (p. 3). Described as a mixture of technology-enhanced learning experiences combined with more traditional learning experiences, blended learning entails integration of both face-to-face interaction and technologically mediated interaction between students, teachers and learning resources (Bliuc et al., 2007; McGarry et al., 2015) .",

It is precisely when the student 'does'when for example, they are asked to synthesis, evaluate and createthat opportunities for higher order thinking arise and deep learning and retention is most likely to occur (Biggs and Tang, 2007) . Active learning techniques include engaging with learning materials in authentic and simulated environments, group and project work, case-based and problem-based learning, and collaboration with other students (Zepke et al., 2010) .

Learners who maintained multiple roles in addition to their studies (such as breadwinner or primary informal caregiver) reported high levels of stress and personal pressure (Dacanay et al., 2015) .

From the student perspective, communication was least effective when communication between teaching staff and students was restricted to an online setting (Poon, 2013) . Literature reported a need for open and prompt communication to reduce anxiety and minimise resistance to online learning, and the importance of communication when implementing innovative teaching strategies (Dorrian and Wache, 2009) . Furthermore, if a student perceived a lack of direct contact and communication with staff, it affected their interaction, orientation and focus to studies, which, in turn, impacted negatively on assessment and feedback (Owens et al., 2009 ). On the whole, literature positively reported on communication strategies that promoted support mechanisms for learning, such as online discussion boards, forums and interactive videos and responses to course evaluation (Dorrian and Wache, 2009; Lyons and Evans, 2013; Meyer et al., 2014; O'Flaherty and Timms, 2015) .",

For example, older studies focussed on 'principles for good practice' in undergraduate education (Chickering and Gamson, 1987) , and have tended to obsess over whether there was a significant difference between online learning and face-to-face learning (Russell, 1999) . Recent studies are more nuanced, and have explored learning from a 'micro' perspective focusing on elements that have fostered and inhibited learning. Therefore these studies emphasize 'interaction' and 'engagement' in an online setting (Vaughan et al., 2013) . Literature also showcases exponential development of blended learning in nursing education over the past 20 years. Many factors contribute to effective learning in an online setting, including the design of learning activities, technical issues, support mechanisms and communication strategies (student-teacher and student-to-student). The construction of any learning environment needs also to be purposeful and well designed to effectively stimulate learning and adequately prepare undergraduate nurses for clinical practice. The role of communication (also called teaching presence) to effectively promote or inhibit learning is well documented (Anderson, 2008; Hollingshead, 1998; Chant et al., 2002; Schaefer et al., 2003) . In an online setting effective communication strategies must be 'built in' to the design and cannot be assumed as in face-to-face settings. When communication strategies are not well-defined nor appropriately utilised, restrictions to synchronous and asynchronous learning occur. Conversely, when communication is effective, relationships between the student and the staff are optimised and student satisfaction is increased.",

This becomes clear in the case of online learning environments, for example, which need to be approached differently to face-to-face settings. The literature calls for educationalists to approach their teaching and learning materials differently than they do in face-to-face settings; educators need to scaffold students through learning activities, build in teacher presence and collaboration, and make transparent teaching and learning strategies (Vaughan et al., 2013) . Online courses are ineffective when viewed simply as repositories of course materials. As this is a new and emerging field of education, educators also need to be willing to contribute to the scholarship of teaching and learning by documenting and researching their innovations. In other words, effective learning in an online setting requires that teachers take advantage of the unique opportunity technology offers, exploit these aspects, and measure and disseminate their impact (Richlin, 2001) . Implicit in these results is the observation that nurse educators will need to be significantly upskilled so that they are adequately prepared to teach effectively in an online setting. This will require time and resources not just for study and reflection but to implement, evaluate, and refine courses offered as part of any undergraduate nursing studies curriculum. While this may be a difficult feat with current pressures to build research profiles and engage in other university work, it will likely have a significant impact on the quality of online courses and blended learning programmes. This upskilling could also push the development of effective nursing pedagogies, as well as theoretical and methodological aspects of online teaching.",
