Subsequently, it spread rapidly to other provinces, although the government has taken timely measures to shut down the traffic (Du et al., 2020; Kupferschmidt and Cohen, 2020). As of 29 February 2020, data from the National Health Commission have shown that >79,000 confirmed cases have been identified and over 2800 deaths in the whole of China. Besides China, other countries and regions are also affected by COVID-19, which has become a serious public health problem globally (Sohrabi et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020).",

For example, temperature could increase or decrease the transmission risk by affecting the survival time of coronaviruses on surfaces (Casanova et al., 2010; Chan et al., 2011; Van Doremalen et al., 2013). Therefore, it is reasonable to explore the effect of temperature on the spread of this novel coronavirus.

Because the temperature effect could last for several days and the incubation period of COVID-19 ranges from 1 day to 14 days (reported by National Health Commission in China), it is a reasonable choice to use a moving-average approach to account for the cumulative lag effect of temperature (Duan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2015). Therefore, in this study, a GAM with a Gaussian distribution family (Hastie, 2017; Liu et al., 2020) was applied to examine the moving average lag effect (lag0\u20137, lag0\u201314, lag0\u201321) of mean temperature on daily confirmed cases of COVID-19.

Tan et al. (2005) found that the optimum environmental temperature related to SARS cases was from 16 \u00b0C to 28 \u00b0C based on data from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Taiyuan. Moreover, Bi et al. (2007) reported that temperature had a negative relationship with SARS transmission in Hong Kong and Beijing in 2003. A laboratory study using surrogate viruses to investigate the effect of temperature on coronavirus survival on surfaces showed that viruses were inactivated more rapidly at 20 \u00b0C than at 4 \u00b0C (Casanova et al., 2010). Another laboratory study found that coronavirus on smooth surfaces was stable for over 5 days when temperature at 22 \u00b0C\u201325 \u00b0C, and virus viability was rapidly lost at higher temperatures (e.g., 38 \u00b0C) (Chan et al., 2011). Van Doremalen et al. (2013) also observed that MERS-CoV was less stable at high temperature. In brief, most studies showed that there was an optimum temperature for coronavirus and high temperature was harmful to its viability. However, this paper could not observe a negative effect of high temperature on COVID-19 infection. A possible reason may be that the study period was limited in winter, with maximal mean temperature 26.9 \u00b0C. Further laboratory studies also need to be conducted to determine the underlying mechanism.",
