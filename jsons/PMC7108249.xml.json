Using sophisticated large-scale automation, it was anticipated that this would generate an unprecedented number of novel leads, resulting in a substantial increase in novel drug entities launched to the market per year. However, in reality, the opposite was the case 1, 2. Frequently, the discovered hits could not be validated and further optimized into actual leads and preclinical candidates. Thus, the initial euphoria surrounding these approaches has subsided owing to the disappointingly low hit rates and significant costs involved 3, 4.",

            "text": "Such situations fuel the consideration and development of alternative techniques. The expression \u2018virtual screening\u2019 (VS) was coined in the late 1990s; however, the techniques involved are much older. In an effort to show that searching for lead candidates using a computer is a serious alternative to HTS, the term \u2018VS\u2019 was adopted by the community. In contrast to HTS, which is largely phenomenological and technology driven, in VS, compounds are selected by predicting their binding to a macromolecular target using computer programs (in drug discovery, the term \u2018target\u2019 or \u2018receptor\u2019 is used frequently to describe the macromolecule to which a drug binds, which is usually a protein but can also be DNA or RNA). The compounds studied do not necessarily exist, and their \u2018testing\u2019 does not consume valuable substance material. Experimental deficiencies, such as limited solubility, aggregate formation or any sort of influence that could possibly interfere with experimentally applied assay conditions do not need to be considered in the initial computational screen. In contrast to HTS, VS requires as a key prerequisite knowledge about the spatial and energetic criteria responsible for the binding of a particular candidate ligand to the receptor under investigation. In consequence, either the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the macromolecular target \u2013 as given by crystal structure analyses, NMR or sophisticated homology modelling \u2013 or, at the very least, a rigid reference ligand with a known bioactive conformation mapping out the putative receptor binding site must be available [5]. This defines VS as a knowledge-driven approach. Even though it is likely that multiple screening campaigns have been performed in parallel in industry 6, 7, 8, 9, it was only recently that McMaster University launched an open and unbiased competitive screening against Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase to detect inhibitors [10], to assess how well VS can enrich candidate ligands compared with HTS random screening 10, 11. The original sample set of compounds used for screening was split into two, and one fraction was tested by HTS. Obtained hits were reported and served as a training set to validate and tailor applied VS tools in different research groups, who entered into a competition to retrieve hits also detected by the experimental screen in the second portion of the screening sample 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Subsequently, in a totally unbiased fashion, the second part of the data sample was evaluated by HTS and VS in parallel. Unexpectedly, the second portion did not show any hits as competitive inhibitors, as would be expected for ligands docked into the substrate binding site of a target protein. Interestingly, Brenk et al.\n[16] reported on some promising hits found by docking that were not detected as inhibitors in the initial HTS. Retesting at higher concentration indicated weak inhibition. This observation could be seen as supporting the view that VS and HTS are complementary approaches and that they might find candidates missed by the other 7, 9.",

            "text": "As mentioned above, the methods involved in VS are much older than the approach itself. Initial attempts to find ligands by docking or by mapping them onto ligand-based pharmacophore models were the generic prototypes of a VS approach. However, this term was not used at that time, probably because computers and algorithms were not fast enough to enable large scale applications. Focusing on approaches that actually make use of an available protein structure, one of the first systems to be studied by docking was HIV protease. Initial versions of the program DOCK, developed over many years by Kuntz's group 17, 18, tried to dock rigid entries from the Cambridge Crystallographic Database into the protein receptor, focusing primarily on shape complementarity and later considering chemical complementarity. In 1990, the Kuntz group retrieved the neuroleptic drug haloperidol as a potential \u2018lead\u2019 from a docking screen using a database of known drug molecules as input. However, this compound would have had to be administered at a very high dose \u2013 far beyond a toxicologically tolerable concentration \u2013 to be an effective inhibitor of the protease [19]. Nevertheless, haloperidol as a \u2019lead\u2019 gave rise to some new ideas for developing a derivative possessing 15 \u03bcM inhibition of HIV protease [20]. Later, at Dupont-Merck, a 3D database search retrieved a substituted terphenyl derivative as a putative lead for inhibiting this protease. Further optimization via six- and seven-membered rings resulted in the class of cyclic ureas that are able to replace the crucial structural water molecule in the protease, at the same time targeting the carboxy groups of the two catalytic aspartates via two appropriately placed hydroxy functionalities [21]. Since these early VS attempts, a plethora of case studies has been performed and the list of success stories is steadily growing. Despite the fact that VS is still a young discipline, it has been reviewed frequently 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, most recently in a comprehensive overview by Kubinyi [31]. If one excludes purely retrospective studies, in which the potential of a method is demonstrated by its ability to enrich putatively active molecules from a sample of anticipated nonactive ones, \u223c50 targets have been studied to date, and reports on the discovery of mostly micromolar binding ligands in a truly predictive fashion are available (Table 1\n). Still under development, and far from mature, the number of strategies followed in VS is nearly as large as the number of reported screening campaigns. Owing to space constraints, this review is unable to give a comprehensive overview of success stories or investigated targets, or to review all details of currently applied VS protocols; accordingly, the reader is recommended to consult the above-mentioned surveys 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. Instead, this review attempts to summarize and comment on the agreed concepts and prerequisites for performing successful VS runs. Furthermore, it attempts to analyse the limitations of the approach in a frank and plain manner and seeks to explain why such limitations still exist. Accordingly, in the following sections, first the target selection, analysis and preparation are discussed, followed by considerations about the compilation of a candidate ligand screening sample. This is followed by a discussion of the actual requirements, tools and strategies of a VS campaign, and, finally, remarks concerning the accuracy of the scoring and ranking of the screening results.",

Clearly, the availability of the target receptor is of great benefit compared with situations where only a rigid reference ligand is known. The target receptor could be any macromolecular biomolecule, either a protein, RNA or DNA. In terms of the rigid reference ligand, either a substrate, inhibitor molecule, agonist or antagonist (e.g. a steroid hormone) could serve. Because the structures of target receptors are becoming increasingly available, this review concentrates solely on such situations. However, it does not mean that VS cannot be applied to situations in which no structural information about the target receptor is available [5]. With respect to DNA and RNA as target receptors, the development of appropriate docking and scoring tools has been initiated only recently, and, accordingly, VS applications on such targets are still rare 32, 33. By contrast, the scope of applications addressing proteins ranges from enzymes to G-protein-coupled receptors and ion channels (Table 1).",

            "text": "The first issue to be considered is the druggability of the selected target. Does the selected protein exhibit a binding pocket that can be successfully targeted by small molecule ligands? Clearly, characteristics such as pocket size and geometry, surface complexity and roughness, exposure of recognition properties and their complementarity in shape and polarity with respect to a putative druglike ligand, are of importance. Because such criteria are not immediately available, a pragmatic, but hardly generally applicable, approach would be to correlate gene families. If one member of such a family is able to bind a drug, other members might also be able to bind druglike ligands with related physicochemical properties [34]. This assumption is based simply on the fact that members of a gene family usually operate on related substrates or recognize similar endogenous ligands. However, the setup for a VS study requires more conclusive information about the actual binding-site architecture. Recently, Hajduk et al.\n[35] suggested several very decisive indices that help to discriminate druggable from nondruggable binding pockets. For druggability, the total surface area and a portion of a polar contact area below 75 \u00c52 appear to be beneficial, along with an appropriate pocket compactness, surface roughness and complexity. This suggests that there is an optimal size and composition of a protein-binding pocket that is best suited to recognize and accommodate small organic ligands. However, the analysis by Hajduk et al. also showed that no single index consistently dominates the correlation. This fact points to the complexity of the interrelationships among the various discriminatory indices and explains why, at present, our concepts for predicting druggability are still rudimentary.",

            "text": "The selection of an appropriate 3D geometry for the target is another important issue when setting up a VS run. The most powerful method for learning about the spatial structure of proteins is crystal structure analysis. The accuracy and reliability of this method strongly depends on the resolution of the diffraction data. An alternative experimental technique to determine protein structures is NMR; there the accuracy of the structural determination depends strongly on the local distribution of the Nuclear Overhauser Effect distance information along the protein chain (this effect involves transfer of magnetization through space and gives information about distances between nuclei in a 3D structure). Furthermore, in the past, significant methodological enhancements in homology modelling have improved the quality of protein models 36, 37, 38; accordingly, several successful VS screening campaigns have been reported based on model-built protein structures 39, 40, 41. Homology modelling strongly depends on the availability of related proteins for which a crystal structure has been determined. The model will be particularly precise in those areas where the homology with the experimentally determined references is high, which is usually the case in the conserved core regions. However, functional binding sites, to be addressed by VS, are generally located in loop regions where, even among homologues of a gene family, significant differences are experienced (apart from catalytic residues in enzymes that are spatially highly conserved). To enhance the accuracy of model-built structures in regions where the binding sites are found, new algorithms have been suggested that consider the putative binding orientation of known ligands during the homology modelling process. These algorithms feed the information about the binding properties of possibly bound ligands back into the homology building process. Improved binding site geometries can be expected from such approaches 42, 43.",

With respect to the target protein, several methods have been described to simulate flexibility [44]. For VS, it is important to obtain an estimate of the protein conformers competent at accommodating a ligand. Once these conformers have been determined, a VS run can either be performed by considering the flexibility of the protein instantly during the calculation, or by addressing an ensemble of several rigid receptor conformations 45, 46, 47, 48. Ligand-binding competent conformers can either be sampled by exhaustive conformational searches (e.g. using molecular dynamics simulations 49, 50) or by examining multiple conformational states, observed in crystal structures with different ligands bound, to obtain insight into the relevant conformations 51, 52. The latter approach appears tempting because it can be assumed that a sample of experimentally observed protein conformers corresponds to stable, low free-energy states.",

            "text": "Even though the crystal structure is usually considered as the \u2018gold standard\u2019 for learning about the geometry of a protein, it is highly questionable how representative a single structure determination really is. McGovern and Shoichet [53] reported on increasing information decay, irrespective of whether the geometry of a ligand-bound or ligand-free crystal structure was used or a model-built structure was considered. Principally, crystalline protein\u2013ligand complexes can be prepared by exposing preformed crystals of a protein to the solution of a ligand, which can then diffuse into the crystals and find its way to the binding site. This process is called \u2018soaking\u2019. Alternatively, in a cocrystallization experiment, the protein\u2013ligand complex is formed by equilibrating them in solution, and then the assembled complex is crystallized. We recently observed, depending on the soaking protocol applied, different conformational states of the protein aldose reductase complexed by the inhibitor zopolrestat [54]. In one structure, the protein forms a hydrogen bond with the ligand via one of its binding site-exposed amide bonds (Figure 1\n). In a second structure, the amide bond is rotated off from the binding site, and the same ligand can no longer form this hydrogen bond. Such differences have a significant impact on docking and scoring results in VS. Depending on the crystallization conditions, ligands have been observed to accommodate a binding pocket with reversed orientation [55]; in other cases, ligand-induced conformational adaptations of the protein are observed [56] (Figure 2\n). Increasing the concentration of a ligand in the soaking buffer will enhance the opportunity to accommodate it in the binding pocket. However, it is likely that soaking depicts some kind of kinetic trap for ligands; consequently, surprising differences in cocrystallization have been observed (several ligands bound at one time, multiple binding modes [57]). Before selecting a particular crystal structure as a reference for a VS run, detailed analysis of parameters such as population of the bound ligand, B-factors next to the binding site (B-factors indicate thermal motion in a crystal structure; however, they are highly correlated with the population of a ligand in the crystal) or consistency of the hydrogen bond network is advisable.",

This is by no means easy to perform because local dielectric conditions can modulate pK\na values of functional groups by several orders of magnitude. Even more complex and, at present, difficult to calculate are pK\na shifts of residues during the course of ligand binding. Isothermal titration calorimetry [58] measurements can make such changes apparent; these changes probably occur more frequently than we presently admit [59], and can easily turn an acceptor functional group into a donor or a charge-assisted hydrogen bond into a neutral one. These changes are of significance during various validation steps of a VS run. We have recently observed that even the protonation states of the residues in the binding pocket of inhibitor-bound aldose reductase can change depending on whether the cofactor NADPH/NADP+ is present in the oxidized or reduced state (Figure 3\n) (O. Kr\u00e4mer and G. Klebe, unpublished results).",

Different strategies with respect to docking and scoring will be the consequence (see below). Experience shows that conformational adaptations observed in a protein-binding pocket are usually related to the structural modulations potentially needed by the protein to accomplish its functional role [51]. Such functional adaptations must correspond to low-energy transformations, otherwise dramatic shortcomings in the functional performance of the protein would be the consequence. Accordingly, enzymes that operate on a large palette of structurally diverse substrates (cf. aldose reductase and short chain dehydrogenases) or perform substantial conformational adaptations during catalysis (cf. kinases) will experience multiple binding-competent states that have to be considered in VS. Thus, a profound understanding of the functional properties of a protein might be the best option for predicting the conformational adaptability of a protein. Such information is not usually available at the beginning of a drug development project, when VS is used. Because proteins occur in gene families of closely related members, the analysis across different entries of the family might provide some insight into the flexibility properties inherently shared by the members of the family. However, it might also be that some family members display rigid solutions, as required by their function (e.g. trypsin and factor Xa among the serine proteases), whereas others possess pronounced flexible behaviour, as appropriate to their function (e.g. the serine protease factor VIIa) [60].",

The analysis of several thousand crystal structures of ligand\u2013protein complexes using the waterbase module in Relibase 65, 66 revealed that, in about two-thirds of all cases, a water molecule is involved in ligand binding, frequently mediating contacts between protein and ligand. Thus, any approach based on the prediction of binding modes of putative candidate ligands, as required in VS, must take water into consideration. One possible approach for learning about water molecules tightly bound to the protein is the analysis of crystallographic data with respect to the repeated occurrence of water molecules in structurally related binding sites (e.g. in a gene family) or multiple structural determinations of the same protein with many distinct ligands [66]. If water is present in all structures analysed at more or less the same location, this is a strong indication that this water molecule is tightly bound, and in a VS run could be considered as an integral part of the target structure.",

How well do they cover chemical space, and which portion of this space represents druglike molecules? Some dramatic figures have been proposed concerning the number of organic molecules that can be considered as druglike. Usually, molecules meet these criteria if they are composed only of the elements H, C, N, O, P, S, Cl and Br, and possess a molecular weight <500 Da [68]. How diverse should the entries of a compound database used for screening be? What physicochemical properties have to be met by the candidates to guarantee sufficient bioavailability? The concept of a well-balanced and homogeneously populated space of diverse druglike molecules appears very tempting; however, there is no proper definition of what descriptors to use as coordinates on the axes of such a compound space. What is \u2018diverse\u2019 in this context? As with the criterion \u2018similarity\u2019, the expression \u2018diversity\u2019 is a relative measure that relates to a reference point. In VS, the reference point is the target receptor and the difference in binding affinity of two ligands with respect to this structure. This defines whether two molecules should be classified as \u2018similar\u2019 or \u2018diverse\u2019. It can be imagined that, for one target, a correctly placed methyl group on a ligand might have a dramatic effect on binding affinity, whereas for another it will be tolerated with no change in binding affinity. In the first case, the ligands with and without a methyl group would have to be termed \u2018diverse\u2019, whereas in the second, they will be called \u2018similar\u2019. However, consulting a \u2018diversity\u2019 scoring that concentrates solely on the topology of a ligand, the methylated and unsubstituted derivatives will probably be ranked as \u2018highly similar\u2019.",

In the past, combinatorial chemistry in particular has enabled pharmaceutical companies to develop screening libraries of several million candidate molecules; thus, in principle, the sheer number of test compounds is no longer an issue. Although large in total count, the individual members of such libraries are usually large in terms of size and molecular weight. They are mostly in the range of typical drug-size molecules, having been synthesized in other drug development projects. However, if they turn out to be a micromolar screening hit, they still require optimization to improve their affinity towards the target protein by two or three orders of magnitude. This has to be accomplished while maintaining reasonable molecular size and appropriate absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion properties. In consequence, it involves stripping down to a scarcely decorated core skeleton while subsequently building up this core again with novel well-tailored side chains. This is a challenging task, and is often difficult to achieve. Experience from drug optimization programs has shown that small core fragments (\u2018privileged templates\u2019 or \u2018fragments\u2019) known to bind with significant affinity are ideal starting points for further optimization 69, 70. Accordingly, the compounds selected for VS should leave some room for optimization, thus matching the range of so-called leadlike or fragment-like molecules [71].",

Recently, Martin tested Lipinski's frequently applied rule with respect to experimentally determined bioavailability in the rat [76]. This study showed that the rule of five has predictive ability for neutral and positively charged molecules; however, anions obey different rules, and the size of their polar surface area confers some predictive power. Similarly to the considerations concerning the druggability of binding sites, the criteria for bioavailability are multifactorial. Irwin and Shoichet took the initiative to set up the freely available database ZINC with validated compounds for VS [67]. It is built from 2D compound information, generates 3D coordinates and curates, if possible, from stereo- and regioisomeric ambiguities. Multiple states with respect to protonation, charges and tautomers are enumerated. However, as described for proteins, the properties of compounds might be altered upon protein binding. Insoluble, reactive and aggregating compounds are not represented in the database. The rule of five is a straightforward filter to discard compounds with putatively undesired properties from the screening sample. Depending on the strategy pursued in the subsequent VS campaign, multiple conformers can be precalculated and stored as separate entries in the database.",

This database contains 13.9 million entries. It is possible that such a sample could be used for fragment screening. For larger compounds, exhaustive sampling of possible molecular skeletons will end up in a combinatorial explosion with too many possible solutions. However, proper design criteria, defined by the architecture of the binding site used in VS as the target, might guide the generation of target-tailored virtual libraries for VS.

The most crucial step in VS is the docking of candidate molecules to the target protein 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86. In forward filtering, various criteria are used to reduce the initial data sample, which might comprise several millions of test compounds, to the several hundred or thousand most promising candidates to be docked [87]. In backward filtering, all entries from the data sample are docked to the target protein, and filter criteria are subsequently applied to rank the generated docking solutions. Nowadays, the speed of computers is no longer the limiting factor in selecting the strategy.",

            "text": "The forward technique requires fewer computational resources. This is mainly because of the fact that at each hierarchical filtering step, a significant amount of the original data sample is discarded. However, with a decreasing number of compounds, the filtering becomes computationally increasingly demanding and sophisticated. Flexible docking is the computationally most intensive step of all; thus, the fewer candidates to be considered here, the more effort can be spent in controlling, validating and assessing docking results. This is clearly an advantage of this strategy. Forward filtering eliminates compounds initially according to simple descriptors such as molecular weight, number of rotatable bonds, lipophilicity (usually expressed by the logarithm of the partition coefficient, log P) or crude shape descriptors, such as the ellipticity of the overall structure. Subsequently, information about the receptor's binding site is exploited. Once a hotspot analysis of the most likely anchoring positions in the binding pocket has been performed, a protein-based pharmacophore can be derived [88]. This pharmacophore sets the constraints for the minimal requirement of functional groups to be matched by putative ligands (e.g. number of hydrogen bond donors, acceptors or hydrophobic groups). Molecules satisfying such criteria can be retrieved by any database engine capable of a functional group substructure search. Once the topographical arrangement of the protein-based pharmacophore has been incorporated into the search and the remaining candidates are requested to match this pattern, the study can be further focused. UNITY (UNITY Chemical Information Software, version 4.1, Tripos) and CATALYST [89] are prototypes of such database engines supporting this screening step. An alternative tool is FeatureTrees, which can retrieve molecules of similar topology in feature space [90]. In this context, \u2018features\u2019 are considered as being similar types of functional groups or molecular building blocks. Similarity can be considered as a further filter criterion in VS. For example, if candidate molecules are requested to match with a predefined protein-based pharmacophore, this condition already involves a selection in terms of similarity criteria; however, they are regarded very generally. Furthermore, information about known binders can be used for filtering, although the danger then exists that, owing to biased filters and preconceived concepts, some unexpected and novel chemistry is discarded during the early filtering steps. Finally, docking is pursued, usually considering only 1\u201310% of the initial sample collection. An advantage of the forward filtering approach is that it enables more elaborate docking protocols to be performed \u2013 for example, taking multiple protein conformational states into account or reflecting a protein-based pharmacophore as a restraint in docking. Most importantly, this hierarchical filtering strategy enables the tracking of the performance at the various filter levels by human intervention, and, in particular, visual inspection of docking solutions remains feasible.",

This approach is especially challenging because docking returns multiple solutions for most candidate molecules. Strongly discriminative and reliable scoring functions must be available for analysing the computed results in an automated fashion because visual inspection for the large number of diverse compounds to be examined is hardly feasible. However, it is questionable whether the existing scoring functions are reliable enough to succeed with such heroic demands (see below). Nevertheless, to proceed with the multiple docking solutions from a high-throughput run, the generated docking modes can be filtered with respect to achieved matching of the protein-based pharmacophore, contact complementarity of protein and ligand surfaces or the remaining residual unoccupied voids along the protein\u2013ligand interface. Because nature probably avoids gaps in molecular assemblies, the latter criterion could be a powerful indicator for irrelevant binding modes or the putative accommodation of interstitial water molecules.",

            "text": "Docking is the crucial step in VS. The seminal program DOCK, originally described in 1982 by Kuntz et al. [17], has evolved as the first VS tool. Later, other programs were successfully applied in VS, such as GOLD [91], FlexX [92], Glide 93, 94 or Autodock [95], to name the most popular prototypes. These have been recently reviewed 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102. All docking tools follow slightly different concepts. This might give individual programs a particular advantage in one task with respect to another \u2013 for example, incorporating aspects such as flexibility of ligand and receptor or restraining the docking search engine to particular regions in configuration space (e.g. mapping a protein-based pharmacophore) [103]. However, all docking tools are still far from perfect. An even more challenging, but carelessly disregarded, aspect of docking is the appropriate consideration of water molecules. As indicated above, water molecules are involved in binding in about two-thirds of the known protein\u2013ligand complexes. However, most docking tools ignore them simply because conclusive concepts of how to consider them correctly are missing. If structural evidence is given, preplacement of water molecules in a docking run is a feasible strategy [66]. The docking tool Slide [104] treats preplaced water molecules in a way that still enables their replacement by ligand atoms in docking. The particle concept in FlexX [105] enables the placement of water molecules \u2018on the fly\u2019 during the course of the generation of individual docking solutions. In the docking tool GOLD, water molecules can be switched on or off, and can spin around their principal axes to achieve good contacts with a docked ligand [106]. Recently, the popular docking tools DOCK and FlexX have been equipped with features that enable docking on a preconceived pharmacophore or property distributions 107, 108. Consideration of such criteria will drive docking solutions especially into regions either frequently trapped by other bound ligands or featured by complementary analytical tools as being particularly relevant for binding. The program AutoDock [95] performs docking on a precalculated grid, storing potential values from any sort of interaction field [109]. In the original implementation, Lennard-Jones and Coulomb potential values are used. Sotriffer et al.\n[110] replaced these by knowledge-based potentials, originally implemented into DrugScore. The latter potentials have proven to be powerful for discriminating, and rank among multiple ligand poses. The potential grid approach in AutoDock also enables one to average across the fields produced by various protein frames, so that the conformational degrees of freedom of a protein can be considered. In addition, adapted fields optimized with respect to the binding properties of some known actives in the comparative molecular field-type approach \u2018adaptation of fields for molecular comparison\u2019 (AFMoC) [111] can be used as target potential values in AutoDock [112]. The latter docking tool performs multiple stochastic searches on the potential hypersurface; accordingly, the frequency of occurrence of certain docking solutions can be used as an additional figure of merit for their relevance [113].",

Fragments are easily scattered over a binding site by docking; reliably successful docking can only occur if the binding site itself is restricted in size and shows dimensions similar to the fragments [48]. Interestingly, experimental approaches show the opposite: small molecular fragments (>200 Da) usually populate, in a well-defined manner, in a very limited number of sites in binding pockets 69, 70.",

However, screening large samples of docked solutions to estimate binding affinities is still far beyond tractability. Nevertheless, first-principle methods do not need any calibration or training in experimentally determined affinity data; thus, they will not suffer from inherent experimental shortcomings or accuracy limits.

In the correlation analysis, this fact might point out that another, at first glance surprising, property pops up as the best explanation. However, it might be the case that the latter property is not on its own essential in a physical sense, but is highly correlated with another property that is actually crucial. We recently parameterized a new regression-based scoring function on the basis of a large sample of crystal structures with known affinities for the bound ligands. Depending on the composition of the training set, different terms are found to be relevant in the analysis. This clearly shows that such empirical scoring functions reflect a best fit with respect to the training set used but they rarely achieve generality.",

The relative differences in binding data within a series of compounds can be determined precisely \u2013 usually much better than across data from various systems for which the comparison has to be performed on an absolute scale. In consequence, the standard deviations of predicted binding affinities of presently available functions range between 0.7 and 1.5 logarithmic units in binding affinity. This range matches the experimental accuracy achieved for binding data across training sets of growing heterogeneity covering a broad spectrum of targets. In our experience, knowledge-based scoring functions are better able to extract binding geometries generated by a docking program that closely approximate the experimentally confirmed binding mode from a sample set of decoy placements.

This function reliably recognizes the experimentally determined binding mode found in a crystal structure among a set of decoy poses.

Accordingly, it appears advisable to drive docking solutions as close as possible to the native geometries \u2013 that is, as they would show up in a corresponding crystal structure.

Is it advisable to focus scoring on free energy or would it be better to treat enthalpy and entropy as separate terms in the scoring [123]? There is a mutual compensation between enthalpy and entropy owing to the fact that both entities scatter over much larger ranges than does the free energy itself. Considering the binding of a ligand to a protein, enthalpy (\u0394H) and entropy (-T\u0394S) can easily scatter over a 3\u20134-fold larger range than the spread of Gibbs free energy (\u0394G). The mutual compensation of enthalpy and entropy can even be found across closely related molecules [124] (Figure 5\n). Furthermore, many physicochemical phenomena of relevance for the binding process are not yet fully understood and, therefore, have not yet been correctly incorporated into scoring functions (e.g. the role of water, change in protonation states or an appropriate consideration of entropy). Interestingly, microcalorimetry indicates that with increasing temperature, the protein\u2013ligand binding process becomes more exothermic and entropically less favourable 58, 59. Because this observation applies to all targets, it suggests that general phenomena are involved which are not yet understood at a molecular level. Despite our present deficiencies in understanding the physics of the binding process, scoring still works satisfactorily \u2013 most likely because we consider the binding of ligands to a protein on a relative scale to each other. Accordingly, any unappreciated phenomena, similar across all complexes in the analysis, will simply be cancelled out. For example, as mentioned above, one approach for reflecting protein flexibility applies parallel docking into several rigid binding-competent conformers of the protein. The disadvantage of this strategy is the fact that additional degrees of scoring are created: what discriminates the scoring against different protein conformers? Cancellation of unreflected internal protein energy contributions is no longer certain. Studies have shown that a special scoring scheme or protocol is required 48, 52. Because dramatic energy differences between low-energy conformers are unlikely, a modulated pocket size for the different protein conformers might require individual scoring of the altered desolvation properties of the binding site.",

Few of the foundations of protein\u2013ligand recognition are understood well enough to be deployed in a large scale, multi-compound effort such as that commonly undertaken in VS. This calls for further indepth research. In particular, protein flexibility and induced-fit adaptations, the role of water in solvation, desolvation and ligand binding, and the electrostatics involved, including changes in protonation states and an appropriate consideration of entropic changes, will need to be better understood to improve the hit retrieval rates in VS. Frequently, experimental work performed in parallel or as a follow-up to a VS campaign provides a whole bunch of unexpected results pointing towards manifold deficiencies of the concepts applied. Many more experimental studies are required. Nevertheless, VS has proven successful and as a valuable alternative to HTS, in particular if it is used as a tool to support and complement hit discovery. Compared with HTS, it is significantly cheaper and faster to use. It can be easily rerun under modified conditions \u2013 for example, if additional information about the target protein under consideration becomes available or novel filter criteria are taken into account.",

            "text": "It is interesting to note that an experienced modeller or medicinal chemist can often figure out whether a particular binding pocket appears druggable or a certain molecule obeys the rules of drug likeness; however, putting such knowledge into computer algorithms makes the multifactorial nature of these rules apparent, complicating attempts to generalize them. The same multifactorial nature holds true for docking and scoring. It is therefore highly advisable to refrain from fully automated strategies in VS. Experience and human intervention are of the utmost importance for keeping control over the various filter steps in a VS run. Used in such a way, VS can be successful; in particular, if information about molecular similarity is considered in terms of generic physicochemical properties and not simply as chemical formulae. Considering similarity concepts takes the risk that highly diverse molecules remain undetected; however, it probably makes the searches simpler because many parameters that actually matter in VS, and which are not properly considered, simply cancel each other out in a relative comparison. Considering all of the mentioned limitations, and taking molecular similarity as some kind of work-around to evade existing shortcomings, a critical reviewer might raise the question of whether, under such restrained conditions, VS can really contribute something novel that an experienced medicinal chemist would not have thought about. Only successful examples can convince. We applied VS to a tRNA-modifying enzyme for which the inhibitor replaces either guanine or preQ1 (a precursor to the modified base queuine) as a substrate in the enzyme recognition pocket (Figure 6\n). Initial VS searches retrieved structures that, admittedly, an experienced medicinal chemist might also have suggested as being \u2018substrate-like\u2019. However, a follow-up VS screen in which several water molecules were allowed to be replaced in the binding site suggested a cyclic urea structure with a different orientation in the binding pocket [126]. Synthetically, this lead appeared tempting and presently serves as a starting point for a new series of compounds (Figure 6). This unbiased approach, resulting, in chemical terms, in an unexpected lead, demonstrates that VS can make important contributions to drug discovery, providing some unexpected candidates. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go until it becomes an established tool for routine lead discovery. Interestingly, nowadays, most aspects of contemporary drug discovery are optimized towards high throughput; by contrast, our current increase in the knowledge and understanding of protein\u2013ligand recognition principles is still proceeding at a low-output rate.",

Depending on the oxidation state of the bound cofactor NADPH (left) and NADP+ (right), aldose reductase binds to a carboxylate-type inhibitor (e.g. IDD594) by placing its acid functional group (red) into the catalytic centre; the complex thereby formed remains either in an unchanged protonation state (left) or picks up protons upon binding (right). In the centre, the crystal structure of the complex is shown. A short contact distance between the carboxylate function of the inhibitor (shown with a yellow surface) and the nicotinamide portion of the cofactor (shown with an atom-type coloured surface, where oxygen is red, nitrogen is blue, carbon is white, sulfur is yellow and phosphorous is orange) is formed. High resolution X-ray crystal structure analysis and neutron diffraction has provided evidence that the inhibitor binds with its carboxylate function in the deprotonated state, and the active site His is present in the neutral state. It remains unresolved where the proton goes in the case of the NADP+-bound complex, or whether the residues of the catalytic centre exhibit deviating protonation states in the uncomplexed and inhibited situation. With respect to VS, a unique and precise assignment of the protonation states of the ligand and protein functional groups in a pKa range between 3 and 11 is essential because, for example, for docking it is important whether such a group is considered as donor or acceptor of a hydrogen bond (Kr\u00e4mer and Klebe, unpublished).",

These searches were based on the protein-based pharmacophore shown on the left (contours for hydrogen bond acceptor group) and in Figure 4. An experienced medicinal chemist could possibly have come up with similar suggestions for potential leads such as 1\u20134. However, in a second VS campaign we focused on the replacement of two water molecules at the lower right rim of the binding pocket of t-RNA guanine transglycosylase (right, contours for hydrogen bond acceptor group [126]). This screen suggested 5 as a potential hit. Its cyclic urea-type skeleton is distinct in its structure and binding mode from any known natural substrate and it can serve as a synthetically easily accessible lead. Several derivatives (e.g. 6\u20138) have been synthesized and show a reasonable structure\u2013activity relationship (Stengl et al., unpublished).
