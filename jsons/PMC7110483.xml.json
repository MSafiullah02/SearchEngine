On 23 September 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed by the United Kingdom (UK) of a 49-year-old male Qatari national who had a travel history to Saudi Arabia and Qatar and showed symptoms of nCoV infection [2]. In November 2012, the virus was identified as a novel betacoronavirus, the closest relative of the bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5, by Dr. Ron Fouchier's group at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and thus termed \u201chCoV-EMC\u201d [3]. In May 2013, this virus was renamed as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [4], and the term was then adopted by WHO [5].",

Some of the patients reported in Europe were originally infected during their travel in the Middle East and became ill after their return to Europe, while others who had not been to the Middle East, but had been in close contact with laboratory-confirmed or probable cases, became infected because of limited person-to-person transmission. So far, eight MERS-CoV clusters have been reported. The largest cluster was linked to one healthcare facility in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia, consisting of 25 patients and including 14 deaths. Two of these patients are healthcare providers who were infected after caring for patients with MERS-CoV infection [5], [6]. This evidence strongly suggests human-to-human transmission involving different modes, such as droplet and contact transmission, although the efficiency of human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV is lower than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [6]. However, MERS-CoV may gain increased human-to-human transmissibility after its further adaptation and evolution in humans or as-yet unknown intermediate hosts, eventually causing a global pandemic like the one caused by SARS-CoV in 2003 [7], [8], [9], [10].",

It can infect various mammalian cell lines, such as primate, porcine, bat and rabbit cells [18], suggesting that MERS-CoV may have broad species tropism. It was reported that some MERS-CoV cases, as noted above, had a history of contact with animals, such as camels and goats [19], suggesting that MERS-CoV may have jumped from bats to these animals before infecting humans. However, its animal reservoir and intermediate hosts still have not been identified, which has significantly hindered the development of strategies to control this emerging infectious disease and combat the potential pandemic of MERS.",

However, our study demonstrated that the epitopes eliciting the cross-reactive antibodies may not be located in the RBD of SARS-CoV S protein [29].

Therefore, immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory drugs, which diminish inflammation during infection, are expected to have therapeutic benefit [36]. However, whether or not the immunosuppressant drugs should be used for treating MERS patients is debatable. First, no report has yet shown that cytokine storms are indeed responsible for the deaths of MERS patients. Second, cell host response to infection with MERS-CoV is much different from that to SARS-CoV infection [37]. Yuen and colleagues believed that corticosteroid should not be considered for treating MERS, particularly since patients with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure could be supported by ECMO until the cytokine storm is over [38].",

Therefore, the S2 subunit of the MERS-CoV S protein may serve as a target for developing MERS-CoV fusion inhibitors. In the early 1990s, Jiang et al. [39] and Wild et al. [40] found that the peptides SJ-2176 and T20 derived from the HIV-1 gp41 HR2 domain had potent anti-HIV-1 activity. In 2003, T20 was approved by the U.S. FDA for treatment of HIV-infected patients who fail to respond to the current antiretroviral drugs [41], [42]. In 2004, Jiang and colleagues identified an anti-SARS-CoV peptide (CP-1) from the SARS-CoV S protein S2 subunit of the HR2 domain [43]. Similar approaches could also be used to identify anti-MERS-CoV peptides. Different from the T20-based HIV/AIDS treatment regimen, which needs long-term injection [44], the MERS-CoV fusion inhibitor-based therapy would only require a regimen of a few days at the onset of MERS-CoV infection to save patients' lives.",
