Recent studies have shown that specific cysteine proteases, such as cathepsins B and L, participate in tumor progression, hyperproliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastasis by malignant cells.3 Cathepsins L and B have a broad tissue distribution and are overexpressed in several human tumors including breast, prostate, lung, gastrointestinal, and epidermal.4 Therefore, cysteine proteases are of special interest as targets for the development of novel chemotherapeutic drugs.5\n",

In order to evaluate the efficacy of selected benzophenone thiosemicarbazone derivatives as reversible inhibitors of cathepsins L and B, a series of analogs was prepared by chemical synthesis as detailed in Scheme 1\n. Briefly, the appropriate acid chloride was converted to its corresponding Weinreb amide and then reacted with a Grignard reagent (formed from dibromobenzene) to yield the requisite ketone. A condensation reaction with thiosemicarbazide in the presence of para-toluenesulfonic acid resulted in formation of the desired thiosemicarbazone analogs.",

For example, analog 1 showed two peaks in the HPLC trace suggesting the existence of E/Z isomers. However, LC\u2013MS confirmed that the minor peak in the HPLC trace of analog 1 represents hydrogen replacing bromine. It is important to note that with other compounds distinct peaks in the HPLC trace correspond to both E and Z isomers as well as hydrogen replacing a bromine atom (see Table 1, Table 2\nand Supplementary data).",

Structurally, the cathepsins consist of two domains (left and right) with a V-shaped active site cleft located along the domain interface.22 This site contains two active residues, a Cys-25 located on the left domain and a His-159 located on the right domain which together, form a stable thiolate-imidazolium ion pair required for the enzyme\u2019s activity.4 Molecular modeling of the most active analog 1 with cathepsin L showed that the conformation with the most favorable relative interaction energy places the bromophenyl ring deep in the S2 pocket with the thiosemicarbazone in close proximity to the active site Cys-25 (Fig. 2\n). The thiosemicarbazone is oriented at the active site by two hydrogen bonds between the NH and NH2 groups and the enzyme Asp-162 (Fig. 2). Details regarding the molecular modeling studies can be found in the Supplementary data.",

The most active inhibitors of cathepsin L all contain a 3-bromo functionality in one of the aryl rings (Table 1). Activity against cathepsin L decreases dramatically when the A-ring bromide is located at the 4-position (Table 2), as observed in a comparison of analog 1 (IC50\n = 30.5 nM) with 24 (IC50\n = 2220 nM). Within the 3-bromo A-ring series, as the functional group at position 2 in the B-ring is varied (F, Cl, Br, and Me) the activity decreases substantially. A fluorine substituent at positions 2 or 4 in the B-ring leads to compounds that are more active inhibitors of cathepsin L compared to analogs containing a fluorine substituent at the 3-position. Additional fluorine substituents in the B-ring tend to provide compounds that are potent inhibitors of cathepsin L (analogs 14, 16 and 22), although certain substituent patterns are less desirable in terms of cathepsin activity (analogs 15 and 21). Analog 23 (nor-3-bromo, 2\u2032-fluoro) is an important control compound verifying that the strong inhibitory activity of analog 1 (3-bromo, 2\u2032-fluoro) against cathepsin L is due to this compound itself and not the inseparable by-product (H replacing Br).",
