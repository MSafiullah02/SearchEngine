Patients with ILI presenting at sentinel sites were enrolled by trained medical staff based on the World Health Organization (WHO) case definitions. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal samples were collected and they were tested at the National Influenza Reference Laboratory using a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) validated real time RT-PCR protocol. Laboratory results and epidemiological data were reported weekly and shared with all sentinel sites, Ministry of Health, Division of Epidemiology, WHO and CDC/NAMRU-3. Results: From April 2010 to December 2012, a total of 955 samples were collected with 52% of the study population aged between 0 and 4 years. Of the 955 samples, 236 (24.7%) tested positive for influenza viruses; with 136 (14.2%) positive for influenza A and 100 (10.5%) positive for influenza B. The highest influenza positive percentage (30%) was observed in 5-14 years old and patients aged 0-4 and >60 years had the lowest percentage (20%). Clinical symptoms such as cough and rhinorrhea were associated more with ILI patients who were positive for influenza type A than influenza type B. Influenza viruses circulated throughout the year with the positivity rate peaking around the months of January, May and again in October; corresponding respectively to the dry-dusty harmattan season and the long and then the short raining season. The pandemic A (H1N1) pdm09 was the predominantly circulating strain in 2010 while influenza B was the predominantly circulating strain in 2011. The seasonal A/H3N2 was observed throughout 2012 year.",

The emergence of novel human pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in April 2009 [7, 8] and its rapid worldwide spread has motivated the monitoring of influenza and has enhanced preparedness to counter a possible emerging pandemic. In the African Region, countries in collaboration with international partners (e.g. WHO, CDC, NAMRU-3, etc.) put efforts together to establish influenza surveillance capacities as part of the broader strategy for Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) [9, 10] . While most countries in Asia, North America and Europe have wellestablished influenza surveillance, few such systems have been established in sub-Saharan Africa [5, 11] . Influenza surveillance helps in understanding the epidemiology and impact of the disease; therefore providing information about seasonality and the groups at high risk of influenza infection. Furthermore, the identification and characterization of circulating viruses will help to provide influenza isolates for monitoring changes in viral antigens and the development of vaccines. Thus influenza surveillance provides data for pandemic influenza monitoring and planning as well as for decision-making [12] [13] [14] .",

Between April and December 2009, cases of ILI were observed and were suspected to be pandemic influenza given the emergence of the novel human pandemic influenza A (H1N1) pdm09. With no ongoing influenza surveillance, our country was not yet ready to confirm and effectively monitor the severity of the disease. The lack of molecular laboratory technology to detect influenza viruses significantly reduced our ability to manage and control the pandemic. Therefore, the Ministry of Health (MoH) in collaboration with the Institut National d'Hygi\u00e8ne (INH) decided to add influenza to the list of diseases with epidemic potential to be monitored and reported through the IDSR Program.

The first samples collected were processed in May 2010 and the presence of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus was confirmed in Togo one year after the novel pandemic influenza occurred in Mexico (April 2009). This is the first report that describes the epidemiology of influenza in Togo using data from the ILI sentinel surveillance system. During the two and half year period of ILI sentinel surveillance, influenza viruses were detected in 236 (25%) of 955 samples. The average percentage positive in this study was higher than the positivity rate observed in 15 other African countries between 2006 and 2010 [17] . However, during the same timeframe, other countries in the temperate climate region: Madagascar (40%), Morocco [18] . There are several reasons to explain the difference in the percentage positive observed between countries including the temporal distribution of these viruses, the sample collection method, the number of samples collected and the geographical distribution of sentinel sites. Most of our data includes post pandemic influenza A (H1N1) pdm09; this is a different picture compared to other African countries (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) and to the South American region. The sample collection method was different from one country to another. In our study, we used two swabs (one oro-pharyngeal and one nasopharyngeal) for each enrolled patient and put both swabs in the same cryotube, thereby increasing the viral load and enhancing RT-PCR detection while in some other countries samples were collected either with nasopharyngeal [19] or oro-pharyngeal swab only [18, 20] . In addition, the number of samples tested in most of the other countries was quite high compared to our sample numbers and they were collected from many sites ranging from only 3 to as many as 22. We only used two sentinel sites as our catchment area. The influenza positivity rate varied by year with the highest rate obtained in 2010. Since the number of samples collected during this year was very low (87 samples) than the two subsequent years, the rate could be influenced. Nevertheless, our percentage positive was similar to that of Ghana and Rwanda in Africa [17] and that of Taiwan [21] , but at different periods of time. Table 3 Distribution of influenza viruses confirmed and ILI patients Influenza A was predominant in 2010 with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) pdm 09 in our study; this observation was similar to that of other countries in West Africa [17] . However, in 2010, the situation was different in other subregions with predominance of influenza B in Central/South and North Africa [17, 22] and seasonal influenza A/H3N2 in East Africa [17] . This difference could be explained by the fact that circulation of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 was delayed in West Africa and occurred one year after it was predominantly circulating in other African subregions [17, 23] . While two years is not sufficient time for an adequate description of the seasonality of influenza virus transmission, we did observe trends in the Lom\u00e9 commune region. The influenza B virus showed a peak activity during the rainy seasons (May and October) and the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 was more frequent during the long dry season while the seasonal A/H3N2 was detected across both seasons. Although the seasonality of influenza viruses in African countries is not yet clear, we observed that our trends were similar with the influenza peaks, which have often been associated with the rainy season activity in other tropical countries [24] [25] [26] .",

This distribution is consistent with the observation in the study conducted in 15 countries of Africa during 2006 to 2010 and in Peru [17, 18, 20] in which young children and adults were shown to have the highest influenza viral disease. Contrary to our study, a study from Venezuela [27] showed higher detection rates in 0-4 year olds. The percentage positive of influenza A was significantly higher in ILI patients in the 15-29 age groups. Therefore, we found that pandemic influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 was detected significantly among 5-29 years old. This finding is consistent with other studies in the African region [17, 22, 28] that have found that pandemic influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 is most commonly identified in school-age children and young adults. While pandemic influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 appeared more often in older children, seasonal influenza A/H3N2 appeared more likely to infect adults in the 30-44 year-age category. Our finding was similar to the observation from a study conducted in Peru [18] , where the author found that the seasonal influenza A/H3N2 virus was detected with adults of 45 to 59 years. In conclusion, our results are consistent with studies from Africa and South American regions which observed that seasonal influenza A/H3N2 affected a wide range of age groups with predominantly 30 to 60 years old while the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 and influenza B virus infections occurred more frequently among older children and young adults.",

            "text": "Our study had some limitations. Our data were collected only from 2 sites in an urban area in the capital city of Togo and could not be generalized to the population. The percent influenza positivity and age distribution of positive cases were influenced by the low number of samples collected which may be attributable to the non availability of a physician to collect nasal and orpharyngeal swabs. The low number of samples may have also contributed to the high positivity rate. In addition, this low proportion may not be representative to better describe the distribution of influenza cases in the age groups. Physician time limitations were due to the time consumption and their workload (number of patients viewed in consultation at the outpatients' department). Children were over-represented in this study thus introducing a bias, as the number of adults was not comparable to children under 5 years old. Some possible reasons to explain this bias include the fact that the Military Health Service has three units but only the family health care center was functional when added as a site in December 2011. Because this unit is a pediatric health center, the high number of children enrolled from this site can account for the observed figures. At the H\u00f4pital de B\u00e8 site, we observed that many patients, mostly adults were not enrolled as ILI patients due to the lack of recorded fever (\u226538\u00b0C), suggesting that we should be considering history of fever as one of the enrollment criteria for ILI. This study focused exclusively on outpatients thus limiting our ability to examine the severity of the influenza viruses in hospitalized cases. Since our influenza surveillance system had challenges in collecting samples of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and the lack of data on hospitalizations with patient follow-up we excluded discussions on SARI from this study. To improve our influenza surveillance system, it will be necessary to expand the system in other regions by including SARI surveillance for severe disease to give a complete picture of influenza burden and epidemiology in our country.",
