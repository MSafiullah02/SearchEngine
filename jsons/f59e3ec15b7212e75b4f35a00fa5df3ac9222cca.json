This report describes findings from experimental infection of inbred Lewis rats with Seoul virus strain 80-39. Rats inoculated with virus intraperitoneally at 6 days of age became persistently infected without clinical signs. Tissues from Seoul virus-inoculated 6day-old rats were assessed at 6, 9, and 12 weeks post-inoculation for viral RNA by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH) and for infectious virus by inoculation of Vero E6 cells. Virus was isolated from lung and kidney of infected rats at 6 weeks and viral RNA was detected in lung, kidney, pancreas, salivary gland, brain, spleen, liver and skin at 6, 9 and 12 weeks. Rats inoculated with Seoul virus intraperitoneally at 10 or 21 days of age became infected without clinical signs but had low to undetectable levels of viral RNA in tissues at 6 weeks post-inoculation. ISH identified vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells as common sites of persistent infection. Cultured rat smooth muscle cells and to a lesser extent cultured endothelial cells also were susceptible to Seoul virus infection. Pancreatic infection resulted in insulitis with associated hyperglycemia. These studies demonstrate that infant Lewis rats are uniformly susceptible to asymptomatic persistent Seoul virus infection. Additionally, they offer opportunities for correlative in vivo and in vitro study of Seoul virus interactions in host cell types that support persistent infection.",

Study of persistent infection in vivo has been hampered by lack of a versatile animal model. This report demonstrates that Seoul virus (SEOV) infection of inbred Lewis rats may fill this need. It shows that Lewis rats are susceptible to persistent SEOV infection, that blood vessels are a major site of persistent infection, and that cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) and endothelial cells are susceptible to SEOV. These findings suggest new options for correlative in vivo and in vitro study of virus-host interactions, including influences of host immune factors. Additionally, we confirm that pancreatic islets are a site of persistent infection with resulting insulitis and hyperglycemia. Finally, we demonstrate that SEOV infects skin, which implies an additional source for natural exposure and transmission.",

This aspect of our study confirms previous results of experimental hantavirus infection in rats [14, 36] . Although we did not observe intestinal infection, infection of the liver and pancreas could lead to fecal infectivity by excretion of bile from infected liver and enzymes from infected pancreas. The new finding of SEOV viral RNA in skin, by contrast, should provoke reassessment of risks for transmission of infection. ISH demonstrated that skin infection was persistent and involved epidermis, dermal and subcuticular vasculature, and myofibers of the panniculus carnosus, the underlying muscle layer. Additional studies are needed to determine if SEOV RNA in skin represents infectious virus. If so, it would broaden potential routes for viral transmission by aggressive behavior such as biting first proposed by Glass and co-workers [9] . While bite wounds could produce viremia directly, they also could result in local viral replication in skin. Conversely, skin infection could contribute to virus transmission through oral contamination of aggressor animals. While epidermal infection also may enhance risks for contact transmission or environmental contamination through exfoliation of keratinocytes, such cells are usually non-viable and therefore unlikely to harbor infectious virus.",

For example, viral antigen was widely disseminated in newborn and 6 week-old Wistar rats inoculated with several strains of SEOV (SR-11, KI-262 or TB-314) or Hantaan virus 76-118 [15] . Inoculation of adult rats caused persistent infection in some animals, with viral antigen detected, at varying prevalence, in a more restricted distribution (lung, spleen, liver and heart) [15] . Lee et al. reported that virus shedding in urine and feces of infected rats occurred with Hantaan virus strain 76-118 but not with SEOV 80/39 [22] . SEOV has been reported to persist in young rats for 6 months whereas it persists in adult rats less than 2 months [13] . The duration of infection, not surprisingly, also is affected by immune status. Thus, immunodeficient nude rats are more susceptible to SEOV infection than immunocompetent rats [7] . Lastly, gender also may affect susceptibility since male rats were reported be more likely to shed virus in saliva or by multiple routes than were female rats [16] . These variables also suggest that more than one model will be required to investigate mechanisms of persistent infection comprehensively.",

Vascular infection exhibited a shift from endothelium to SMC during the transition from acute to persistent infection. A similar shift occurs in persistent parvovirus infection of rats, which also is vasculotropic [12] , and suggests that vascular infection begins in endothelium, as a result of viremia, then extends to subjacent SMC. Alternatively, viral injury to endothelium could lead to direct exposure of SMC by leakage of virus-infected plasma through compromised intercellular junctions. Our results also demonstrated that SMC and, to a lesser extent, endothelial cells are susceptible to SEOV infection in vitro. Therefore, factors influencing the onset and duration of SEOV infection should be amenable to correlative study in vivo and in vitro.",

A similar finding was reported by Lee and co-workers for SEOV infection of F344 rats [21] but was not illustrated with data or photomicrographs. Similarly, Yamanouchi and coworkers found that newborn rats inoculated with SEOV strain B-1 developed antigen-positive pancreatic islet and acinar cells, but blood glucose levels were not reported [36] . Our immunostaining results suggest that insulitis was associated with \u03b2 cell loss, but this observation will require quantification. The correlation between insulitis and hyperglycemia was not absolute, which suggests that both could be transient. However, they were detected as late as 12 weeks post-inoculation. Prolonged inflammation could increase risks of functional damage to endocrine pancreas. It remains to be seen whether SEOV-induced chronic insulitis leads to a diabetes-like condition with attendant increase in water consumption and urination that could affect the amount or duration of virus excretion.",

There are several potential causes for this variance. Low virus concentrations typical during persistent infections may go undetected after small losses in infectivity during cryopreservation or subsequent dilution of samples during preparation of inocula. Cryopreservation and thawing also can reduce infectivity by rupturing viral envelopes with loss of receptors for binding to target cells. Lastly, it has been suggested that virus can be neutralized by exposure to antibodies during preparation of tissues for tissue culture inoculation [28] . For these reasons, immediate cultivation of test suspensions with indicator cells may be preferable for detecting infectious SEOV in persistently infected tissues. We found that detection of virus is favored by molecular amplification methods, such as RT-PCR. However, these methods detect both infectious and non-infectious viral particles.",

Meyer and Schmaljohn [25] recently reviewed potential factors favoring persistent infection which included: immature host immunity at the onset of infection, immune dysfunction caused by hantavirus infection of antigen presenting cells, antigenic variation of infecting virus to avoid immunological detection, and down-regulation of virus replication in host cells. For example, it has been suggested that SEOV infection of macrophages and lymphocytes could prolong infection by reducing immune responses to virus [26] . SEOV replication generates terminally deleted viral RNAs that have been postulated to downregulate viral gene expression thereby facilitating persistence [24] . This may help to explain why pre-emptive administration of antibody can protect rats from SEOV infection, whereas administration of antibody after the initiation of infection is ineffective [6, 40] .",

            "text": "Adoptive cell transfer studies performed in mice imply a protective role for cell-mediated immunity against hantavirus infection. Transfer of unsorted or B cell-depleted immune splenocytes protected neonatal BALB/c against challenge with Hantaan virus [27] . Additionally, transfer of immune sera or T cells from BALB/c mice into athymic mice protected them from challenge with Hantaan virus [1] and transferred immune splenocytes protected adult SCID mice against Hantaan virus infection [39] . Comparable experiments have not been reported for the rat. However, development of mononuclear cell infiltrates at some sites of infection (e.g. kidney, pancreas) in our studies is consistent with activation of cell-mediated immunity. Its functional effectiveness must be assessed, including why inflammatory infiltrates do not develop in many persistently infected tissues. The gradual postpartum maturation of immunity in rats, which can take up to several months, may bear on this issue. It suggests that persistent infection is favored in rats infected before achieving full immune competence. The use of Lewis rats should facilitate definition of host immunity in SEOV persistence since they have been extensively characterized immunologically [8] . Moreover, they provide the potential to examine persistent infection and host responses to virus correlatively in vitro and in vivo, using the cell type (SMC) which serves as the major target for persistent infection. Other models of hantavirus persistence in their natural rodent reservoir appear less versatile than the Lewis rat model of SEOV infection. For example, the recently described deer mouse (Peromyscus) model of Sin Nombre virus persistence utilizes an uncommon laboratory rodent for which immunological and cell culture based reagents are scarce [3] .",
