            "text": "One of the most critical issues in cybersecurity is represented by social engineering attacks. These threats have been known for years, but it is very difficult to handle them effectively, because they are strictly related to human nature. Social engineering is not just a phishing email; indeed, it is possible to distinguish several forms of attack which combine different elements, from human to social to physical and technological. According to a psychological point of view, social engineering is a powerful means of gaining information exploiting individuals' weaknesses. Moreover, due to the mechanisms of persuasion, widely studied in literature, it is easy to imagine how complicated the management of this threat is. Appropriate training of employees, especially of key roles of the company, can be an effective antidote to social engineering. Given the current scenario and the future perspective in cybersecurity, it is clear that the approach used to manage cybersecurity requires a radical change. Currently, the preferred cybersecurity strategy is still based on technological solutions, without brilliant results, since cyberthreats keep growing. Many are convinced that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be an opportunity for managing cybersecurity; whether true or not, it is however evident that AI has also the power to generate new threats and to strengthen the existing ones. Therefore, we should be very prudent when technologies are presented as a miracle solution for cybersecurity problems. The starting point is that technology has to be deployed under full human control. Then, critical thinking is needed to develop alternatives to improve the current approach to cybersecurity. In short, we need to develop a multidisciplinary vision of cybersecurity, involving other disciplines and assuming different perspectives.",

It is the fraudulent practice of sending emails, usually appearing to come from a wellknown source (e.g. an important organization) to steal sensitive information, like passwords, credit card numbers, etc. \u2022 Spear phishing: It is a form of phishing tailored to the target recipient (individual or groups). Attackers study the behaviour of their targets and collect information to make the attack believable, in order to increase the likelihood of its success. When victims receive a spear phishing email, they think that the communication comes from a trusted source. For example, Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a fraud where the attacker impersonates an organization executive to lead an authorized employee in that organization to perform a wire transfer to an account controlled by the same attacker. \u2022 Pretexting: Social engineering needs to achieve trust to be successful. For this purpose, it uses an appropriate scenario fabricated in order to convince a targeted victim. Pretexting consists, for example, of impersonating someone else, e.g. a police officer, or an insurance investigator.",

Given the relevance of the target (big fish), the value of information is particularly attractive to cybercriminals. Like spear phishing, the scam email is tailor made, and appears to come from a business partner. \u2022 Vishing: This is a phone scam which combines phishing and voice. Vishing can be considered the telephone equivalent of phishing. Here, given that the fraudulent action is over the phone, empathy and the ability of handling conversation are needed for the success of the attack.",

The episode is worrying, since if a child can unintentionally overcome security blocks, we can imagine what hackers can do. 12 The Ukrainian power system cyberattack is the first publicly acknowledged incident to result in power outages. It left about 225,000 people without power for several hours. 13 In 2016, a massive DDoS attack (distributed denial of service) hit the Internet. Important website platforms, like Twitter, Netflix, etc., took down. The company attacked was Dyn, that controls much of the internet's DNS infrastructure. The attack was realized through a specific malware (Mirai), which infected IoT devices (like DVR players, digital cameras), and accessing the devices using default password and usernames. 14 The report refers to Payment Card Skinner, including all incidents in which a skimming device is physically implanted (tampering) on an asset that reads magnetic stripe data from a payment card. addition, whether data is stored in a physical or digital form, physical access controls are required to prevent unauthorized access.",
