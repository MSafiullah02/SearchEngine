A popular model for modeling this changing variance property is the autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) model introduced by Engle [17] and is extended to generalized ARCH (GARCH) by Bollerslev [6]. An alterative volatility modeling strategy is the stochastic volatility (SV) model, originated by Taylor [34]. Although GARCH models have been the main stream in the industry to model financial assets, many research papers have documented advantages of using SV models, including Harvey et al. [19], Jacquier et al. [21], [22], Kim et al. [23], Danielsson [13], [14] and So et al. [31]. Readers can refer to Ghysels et al. [15] and Shephard [28] for more extensive review of SV models.",

The extension to multivariate class enables us to analyze the financial returns across different securities and markets. The knowledge of returns correlation structure is vital in many financial applications, especially in risk management. Furthermore, it enhances statistical inference and volatility forecasting. For example, So et al. [32] introduced a MSV model that can explain any lead\u2013lag relationship of the volatility structure. Asai and McAleer [3] considered two types of asymmetric MSV model. Asai and McAleer [4] developed a dynamic correlation MSV model. Basic MSV models have been modified to capture different features of financial data or to reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space. Factor MSV models were built up to handle high dimension financial data [10], [12]. So and Kwok [30] developed a multivariate long memory SV model, which was showed to be more consistent with empirical stylized facts than traditional MSV models. Detailed reviews and comparisons on MSV models are given in Danielsson [14], Asai and McAleer [2] and Yu and Meyer [38].",

            "text": "Asymmetry effect in volatility of financial assets means different responses in volatility to good and bad news. In particular, bad news tends to increase future volatility more than good news does. A popular explanation of such asymmetry is the leverage effect given by Black [5] and Christie [11], in which asymmetric SV and MSV models were developed on the basis of the leverage effect [1], [2], [8], [20]. Empirical results in Asai and McAleer [1], [3] suggested that multivariate models are more preferable than univariate models in modeling asymmetry. Besides, the asymmetry effect can also be modeled using thresholds structure. This has been studied in the time series and univariate GARCH literature extensively [16], [26], [35], [36]. Recently, a multivariate threshold GARCH model with time-varying correlations has been proposed by Kwan et al. [24]. In the univariate SV literature, So et al. [33] proposed a threshold SV (THSV) model, in which the asymmetry effect is modeled through a threshold setting that the autoregressive parameters in the SV equation change according to the sign of the previous returns. The THSV model successfully captures the mean and variance asymmetries simultaneously, and was demonstrated through the strong evidence of asymmetries in the empirical data. However, the multivariate extension of the model has not been developed in the literature. This paper aims to fill this gap.",

If one would like to investigate the relationship among different stock markets, the row of rt would be the market indices. One major advancement in this paper is to allow different time series structure in rt based on recent changes in a threshold variable. By doing this, we can use extra information to determine the time evolution of returns and volatility. We define a set of Bernoulli random variables st by(1)st=0ifzt\u22121<01ifzt\u22121\u22650,where zt is the threshold variable. In general, zt can be a function of the k-dimensional return variable rt or any exogenous variable. The MTHSV model is given by the following equations:(2)rt=\u03a80st+\u03a81strt\u22121+ytyit=hituit   ,i=1,\u2026,k,whereut=(u1t,u2t,\u2026,ukt)\u2032\u223cNk(0,I)\u03b1t+1=\u03a60st+1+\u03a61st+1\u03b1t+\u03b7t,\u03b7t\u223cNk(0,\u03a3\u03b7),where ut and \u03b7t are stochastically independent multivariate white noise processes, yt=(y1t,y2t,\u2026,ykt)\u2032 and \u03b1t=(log \u2061h1t,log \u2061h2t,\u2026,log \u2061hkt)\u2032. This MTHSV model generalizes the MSV model in Harvey et al. [19] to allow the coefficient matrices \u03a80st, \u03a81st, \u03a60st+1 and \u03a61st+1 to depend on zt. Then, the mean and volatility asymmetries can be incorporated in the SV modeling while accounting for the interdependence among security returns. Following So et al. [33], we parameterize \u03a80st,\u03a81st,\u03a60st+1 and \u03a61st+1 as\u03a80st=\u03a80+\u0394st,\u03a81st=\u03a81+Cst\u03a60st=\u03a60+\u0393st,\u03a61st=\u03a61+Dst.The k\u00d71 vectors \u03a80,\u0394,\u03a60,\u0393 and the k\u00d7k matrices \u03a81,C,\u03a61,D are unknown parameters to be estimated. To facilitate further discussion, we use the following notations ht=(h1t,h2t,\u2026,hkt)\u2032, Ht=(h1\u2032,h2\u2032,\u2026,ht\u2032)\u2032, Rt=(r1\u2032,r2\u2032,\u2026,rt\u2032)\u2032, St=(s1,s2,\u2026,st)\u2032 and Yt=(y1\u2032,y2\u2032,\u2026,yt\u2032)\u2032 for the rest of the paper. In particular, the conditional variance of yt, i.e. Var(yt|Ht) is H\u02dct=diag{h1t,h2t,\u2026,hkt}.",

As originated in Shephard and Pitt [29], multi-move sampler is an efficient tool for sampling latent state variables in non-Guassian univariate state space models and it enhances the convergence as compared with a single-mover sampler [21]. In order to use the multi-move sampler, the MTHSV model has to be formulated into a partial non-Gaussian multivariate state space form. Let \u03d5t=(log \u2061y1t2,log \u2061y2t2,\u2026,log \u2061ykt2)\u2032 and \u025bt=(log \u2061u1t2,log \u2061u2t2,\u2026,log \u2061ukt2)\u2032. The rather complicated distribution of \u025bit, log \u2061\u03c712, can be approximated by a mixture of normal distributions, i.e. f(log \u2061uit2)\u2248\u2211j=1Pqjf(log \u2061uit2|\u03b3it=j), where log \u2061uit2|\u03b3it=j\u223cNk(\u03bcj\u22121.2704,\u03c4j), qj=Pr(\u03b3it=j), \u03b3it is a discrete mixing variable having values from 1 to P and P=7 is selected in this paper as suggested in Kim et al. [23]. Since the rows of \u025bt are independent, the distribution of \u025bt can be described by k independent log \u2061\u03c712 random variables. The drawing of \u03b3t can be done directly through its full conditional density with the use of an independent normal conjugate prior. Given the \u03b3t\u2019s and under the normal mixture approximation, the state space form of the MTHSV model can be written as follows:(5)\u03d5t=\u03b1t+\u025bt\u03b1t+1=\u03a60st+1+\u03a61st+1\u03b1t+\u03b7t,t=1,\u2026,nwhere \u025bt|\u03b3t\u223cNk(\u03bc\u02dc\u03b3t,\u03c4\u03b3t), \u03b3t=(\u03b31t,\u03b32t,\u2026,\u03b3kt)\u2032, \u03bc\u02dc\u03b3t=(\u03bc\u02dc\u03b31t,\u03bc\u02dc\u03b32t,\u2026,\u03bc\u02dc\u03b3kt)\u2032, and \u03c4\u03b3t= diag {\u03c4\u03b31t,\u03c4\u03b32t,\u2026,\u03c4\u03b3kt}, given \u03bc\u02dc\u03b3it=\u03bc\u03b3it\u22121.2704,i=1,\u2026,k, and \u03b7t\u223cNk(0,\u03a3\u03b7).",

The weighting of the threshold variables were selected so that the contribution of each of the three returns are nearly the same,st=0if0.4r1,t\u22121+0.3r2,t\u22121+0.3r3,t\u22121<01if0.4r1,t\u22121+0.3r2,t\u22121+0.3r3,t\u22121\u22650.\n",

The mean of the posterior mean estimators are close to their respective true values, indicating that the biases of estimation by the posterior means are small. In fact, we observe very close estimates from both posterior mean and median on the average. Moreover, all standard errors are reasonably small. In summary, the experiment evidents that both posterior mean and posterior median can provide us reliable estimates for the unknown parameters in the MTHSV model.",

All data are obtained from Datastream International dated from 3 July 1985 to 30 June 2005, giving a total of 5165 return observations. The daily return is defined as the log-difference of the index price, yt=(log \u2061pt\u2212log \u2061pt\u22121)\u00d7100, where pt is the closing price at time t and \u201clog\u201d in the formula is the natural logarithm. Typical volatility clustering feature with some spikes of high volatility that may be explained by market crashes or well-known financial events can be observed from the plot of the three daily return series1\n. From the summary statistics of the returns data in Table 2\n, highest correlation is observed between the returns of SP500 and FTSE100 (0.413), and the least is between SP500 and HSI (0.154). Besides, the data also exhibit standard properties of asset returns time series, including close to zero sample mean, negative sample skewness and excess sample kurtosis. One of the key issues before executing the MCMC scheme for the empirical data is to decide the threshold variable. A reasonable choice is the lagged one daily return of SP500 since the US stock market plays a major role in the world market movement. We define the lower regime (st=0) and the upper regime (st=1) by the lagged one SP500 return less than and greater than zero respectively. It turns out that 47% and 53% of the returns are in the lower and upper regimes respectively. From Table 2, which presents summary statistics of returns in the two regimes, it is observed that the variance of the three indices are all higher for the lower regime than that for the upper regime. The correlation structure of the three time series is also quite different when the US market goes up rather than going down. The above findings give supportive evidence of the mean and variance asymmetry that a threshold volatility model should be necessary.",

To implement our MCMC sampling scheme for the empirical data, 100000 iterations are preformed, with the first 20000 burn-in iterations being discarded. Table 3\nreports the posterior mean and the corresponding standard derivation (in parentheses) of the parameters for the two regimes. The eigenvalues (in descending order) of \u03a81st and \u03a61st are also given in the table.

It is evident that the coefficients in the autoregressive matrix are predominantly negative in the lower regime with magnitude larger than that in the upper regime. Therefore, clear mean asymmetry is documented from the MTHSV parameters. From Table 3, we can observe clear variance asymmetry from the different values in \u03a60st and \u03a61st for different st. In fact, the largest eigenvalue of \u03a61st in the lower regime is substantially larger than that in the upper regime, indicating that the variance in the lower regime is more persistent.

It caused a highly correlated period among all three series. Negative values in Corr(r13) and Corr(r23) are recorded from April 2002 to August 2003. We divide this period into two parts to discuss: April 2002\u2013October 2002 and March 2003 - June 2003. The main cause for the first part can be the September 11 incidence in 2001. Its economic impact on the US market was critical. On the contrary, the shadow of the incidence did not affect the Hong Kong and China markets much. During this period, the China economy was expanding quickly, from which Hong Kong benefited a lot. The opposite situation caused the negative correlations between the returns of HSI and SP500. In the second part, the US economy revived gradually, however, the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in Hong Kong causes Corr(r13) and Corr(r23) still being negative. The SARS induced a serious economic consequence to Hong Kong. As there were only rare cases of SARS in US and UK, the effect to their economy was insignificant and thus making the HSI returns negatively correlated with the SP500 and FTSE100 returns.",
