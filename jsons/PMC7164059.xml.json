Shortly thereafter, he experienced a steady decline of his lymphocytosis and adenopathy, and he remains in remission over 10 years later. The herbal extract inhibited the survival of primary CLL cells under in vitro culture conditions. However, it did not inhibit the activation of Akt or mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase, neither did it inhibit the serine phosphorylation of STAT1. Thus, through an as yet unknown mechanism, this extract appears to exert pro\u2010apoptotic effects in CLL. ",

German researchers assessed the antiviral potential of ribavirin, 6\u2010azauridine, pyrazofurin, mycophenolic acid and glycyrrhizin against two clinical isolates of coronavirus (FFM\u20101 and FFM\u20102) from patients with SARS admitted to the clinical centre of Frankfurt University, Germany. Of all the compounds, glycyrrhizin, an active component of liquorice root, was the most active in inhibiting replication of the SARS\u2010associated virus. These findings suggest that glycyrrhizin should be assessed for treatment of SARS. ",

It derived predictions as to the number of cases of schizophrenia that would be observed in these birth cohorts, given the following four hypotheses: (1) that there is a causal relationship between C. sativa use and schizophrenia; (2) that C. sativa use precipitates schizophrenia in vulnerable persons; (3) that C. sativa use exacerbates schizophrenia; and (4) that persons with schizophrenia are more liable to become regular cannabis users. There has been a steep rise in the prevalence of C. sativa use in Australia over the past 30 years and a corresponding decrease in the age of initiation of use. There was no evidence of a significant increase in the incidence of schizophrenia over the past 30 years. Data on trends for the age of onset of schizophrenia did not show a clear pattern. C. sativa use among persons with schizophrenia has consistently been found to be more common than in the general population. The authors concluded that C. sativa use does not appear to be causally related to the incidence of schizophrenia, but its use may precipitate disorders in persons that are vulnerable to developing psychosis and worsen the course of the disorder among those that have already developed it.

The objective of this study was to assess in normal volunteers the influence of a standardised E. senticosus extract on the activity of cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 and 3A4. Probe substrates dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 activity) and alprazolam (CYP3A4 activity) were administered orally at baseline and again following treatment with E. senticosus (1 \u00d7 485 mg twice daily) for 14 days. Urinary concentrations of dextromethorphan and dextorphan were quantified, and dextromethorphan metabolic ratios (DMRs) were determined at baseline and after E. senticosus treatment. Similarly, plasma samples were collected (0\u201360 h) for alprazolam pharmacokinetics at baseline and after E. senticosus treatment to assess effects on CYP3A4 activity. Validated high\u2010performance liquid chromatography methods were used to quantify all compounds and relevant metabolites. There were no statistically significant differences between pre\u2010 and post\u2010 E. senticosus treatment DMRs indicating a lack of effect on CYP2D6. For alprazolam there also were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters determined by non\u2010compartmental modelling, indicating that E. senticosus does not significantly induce or inhibit CYP3A4. Our results indicate that standardised extracts of E. senticosus at generally recommended doses for over\u2010the\u2010counter use are unlikely to alter the disposition of co\u2010administered medications primarily dependent on the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 pathways for elimination.

To evaluate the effect of WS 1442 in patients with heart failure and CHD\u2010related congestive heart failure, four studies with New York Heart Association classes II\u2010III patients were analysed.

In addition, an increase in the difference in the pressure\u2013heart\u2010rate product and in the maximal work load was observed, indicating a favourable effect of WS 1442 in the treatment of CHD\u2010related congestive heart failure.

The authors searched the literature using Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, CISCOM, and AMED. Experts on and manufacturers of commercial preparations containing Crataegus extract were asked to contribute published and unpublished studies. There were no restrictions on the language of publication. Two reviewers independently performed the screening of studies, selection, validation, data extraction, and the assessment of methodological quality. To be included, studies were required to state that they were randomised, double\u2010blind and placebo\u2010controlled, and used Crataegus extract mono\u2010preparations. A total of 13 trials met all inclusion criteria. In most of the studies, Crataegus spp. was used as an adjunct to conventional treatment. Eight trials including 632 patients with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association classes I to III) provided data that were suitable for meta\u2010analysis. For the physiological outcome of maximal workload, treatment with Crataegus spp. extract was more beneficial than placebo (weighted mean difference, 7 W; 95% CI 3\u201311 W; P < 0.01; n = 310 patients).
