However, different challenges posed by coronavirus outbreak, have made its various aspects more noticeable to physicians working in different fields. One aspect that is the very focus of the present study, was the level of anxiety among the multiple sclerosis (MS) patients at the current situation. It is well-acknowledged that, anxiety is one of the leading causes of attacks among the MS patients and can also exacerbate this disease (Artemiadis et al., 2011) . Hence, it is of great significance to as much as possible eliminate stressors from these patients' lives. The outbreak of coronavirus in Iran can be one of the causes of anxiety among these patients. So, to examine the above-mentioned hypothesis, the anxiety level of numbers of the MS patients was measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Oh et al., 2018 ) on a specific day, i.e. February 25, 2020. According to the mentioned questionnaire, the level of anxiety can be divided into four levels of none, low, moderate, and severe.",
