A later study indicated that members of Enterobacteriaceae that produce KPC were becoming common in the United States.6 Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics currently recommended as a first-line therapy for severe infections caused by bacteria of Enterobacteriaceae-producing extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs)7. Carbapenemases are particularly dangerous as these can inactivate a wide range of antibiotics. In such cases, one is left with little option of using polymixins and tigecycline.",

Undoubtly, the impact of activity of NDM-1 is threatening as today we may not have potent and effective antibiotics to treat such patients.

It has been concluded that the cases who were found NDM-1 infected, had travelled to Asian countries and acquired infection while on treatment1. Recently such a case has been reported in Canada who had never travelled outside Ontario State in the last decade but acquired NDM-I infection. No family members or friends had any relevant history of travel. The authors have concluded that this was the first reported instance in which an NDM-1 producing organism was locally acquired in Canada10.",
