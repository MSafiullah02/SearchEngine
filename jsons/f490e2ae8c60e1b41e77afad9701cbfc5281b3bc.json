We defined 50 discussion topics, groups of commonly co-occurring words, using a machine learning based approach to natural language processing, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). 5 For each of the 50 topics, we reviewed the ten words and comments most associated with each topic. 6 We identified topics that fell into three categories of interest: response to public health measures, impact on daily life, and sense of pandemic severity. We tracked daily variations in the average prevalence of topics across all comments. In order to improve visualization of patterns of topic change, we used locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) lines. To quantify the degree of change in prevalence, we compared 4-day periods using the two-proportion z-test. We used R version 3.6.1 for all analyses. All data was publicly available, and the study was considered exempt under University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board guidelines.",

Of the 50 LDA topics (available by request), ten pertained to the three categories of interest. Other topics included those related to news sharing, political discussions, and discussions about the science of COVID-19. Table 1 shows key topic words and representative comments, and Figure 1 displays the change in topic frequency over time by category. In the \"public health measures\" category, for instance, \"hand washing\" became less prevalent throughout March (2.7% from March 3 to March 6 vs 1.9% from March 28 to March 31, p < .001; two-proportion z-test). \"Impact on daily life\" topics showed \"travel\" peaking early and dropping throughout the month (3.2% March 3-March 6 vs 1.0% March 28-March 31, p < .001) and concern regarding \"personal finances\" increasing (1.

            "text": "This analysis indicates that longitudinal topic modeling of Reddit content is effective in identifying patterns of public dialogue and could be used to guide targeted interventions. For instance, comparisons to the flu were embraced by the public. Early recognition of this reality could have led to more specific information dissemination campaigns and earlier public acknowledgement of disease severity. Questions about safely spending time outdoors peaked in mid-March, representing a missed opportunity for public guidance. Tracking and responding proactively to common questions, such as what material is best used for a homemade mask, may minimize the spread of misinformation. Notably missing from these Reddit topics were discussions of contact tracing, a growing area of public concern. Limitations of this study include that Reddit users are not representative of all segments of the population, and that Reddit data is not associated with a geographic location. Realtime monitoring of online COVID-19 dialogue holds promise for more dynamically understanding and responding to needs in public health emergencies.
