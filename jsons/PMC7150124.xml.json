This theme aptly embodies the underlying ethos in contemporary forensic practice in Australia. Terrorism is a crime and is not new; rather, it has been elevated into public and political prominence through a series of major incidents. Examples include the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995, the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the 9/11 suicide attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon in the United States in 2001, and the 7/7 suicide attacks on London's public transport system in 2005. Australia has also been targeted by terrorist organizations; the Bali bombings in 2002 and 2004 and the bombing of the Australian embassy in Jakarta in 2005 are examples of successful attacks against Australian citizens and Australian interests, albeit offshore. In common with other countries, Australia has also had a number of domestic plots that have been thwarted in the planning phase.",

            "text": "Although devastating, the effects of terrorist acts of this nature are relatively short-lived and localized and are unlikely to impart a long-term influence on a community or economy. However, the anthrax attacks in the United States in 2001, and the subsequent hoaxes that followed in countries across the globe, demonstrated that acts of bioterrorism have the potential to do enormous harm to populations, infrastructure, and economies [2], [3], [4], [5]. Biological agents such as Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, can persist in the environment for decades (6), thereby presenting an ongoing risk of infection that can prevent the reoccupation of contaminated areas unless costly decontamination processes are undertaken [7], [8]. Other biological agents, such as Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of pneumonic plague, are highly infectious; hence the risk to the public can spread far beyond the original site of dissemination (9). Physical harm aside, the psychological impact of bioterrorism is enormous [5], [10]. This is understandable given that human history is peppered with descriptions of disease epidemics that have killed millions of people (e.g., [11], [12], [13], [14]); plague and smallpox are probably the most notable of all epidemic-causing agents. Not surprisingly, these organisms feature high on government lists of potential biological agents that could be used for acts of bioterrorism (e.g., [15], [16], Table 37.1\n). History also shows that the conduct of acts of bioterrorism and biocrime is not limited to extremist groups and international terrorist organizations but can equally be perpetrated by disgruntled nationals (17). Indeed, the anthrax attacks in the United States in 2001 are examples of how a trusted insider was likely responsible for terrorist acts (18).",

In essence, the primary responsibility to prevent, counter, and respond to acts of terrorism resides within the jurisdictions. The nature of terrorism means its implications may cross jurisdictional boundaries and hence requires a cooperative interjurisdictional coordination of capabilities. As such, each of the states and the two self-governing territories within Australia have a capability to investigate, respond to, and prosecute acts of terrorism, which includes the capability to detect and identify biological agents that could be used for terrorist and criminal purposes. This capability is coordinated through the Australian (Counter) Bioterrorism Laboratory Network (ABLN), which contains representatives from key public health, defense, and law enforcement laboratories, as well as health departments and agencies at the commonwealth, state, and territory levels, and includes the AFP forensic laboratory and the Australian CBRN Data Center. The ABLN is administered by the Department of Health and Aging, the commonwealth government agency that administers the coordination of health systems within Australia. The role of ABLN is to advise on issues relating to the detection and analysis of security sensitive biological agents (SSBAs) and to establish, maintain, and expand collaborative links between public health and law enforcement agencies.",

Microbiology is also an established discipline but until recently has rarely been used in forensic application. In the quest to integrate microbiology into forensic operations, the AFP faced the reality that the law enforcement community had virtually no experience with microbiology and, conversely, the microbiology community had virtually no experience with forensic application or law enforcement. The AFP solution was to establish a basic microbiology capability in-house and then to promote partnerships with diagnostic and specialized laboratories for more intensive investigations. The AFP emphasis is on extending the capability for screening and preliminary identification of potential biological agents at the scene beyond that of first responders. The role of the AFP also includes application of normal forensic procedures from the crime scene to the laboratory. The feasible presence of a microbiological agent does not alter, or reduce, the need to recognize, record, and recover all potential forensic materials and to maintain the integrity of the evidence from the crime scene to the laboratory and through analysis. With that said, the possible presence of a microbiological agent does have implications for these processes.",

The AFP has a general capability across all forensic disciplines to conduct investigations and examinations in chemical and biological (CB) contaminated environments. This capability extends to all AFP personnel required to enter a scene that may contain hazardous substances. This practice is applied in a manner in which all hazards are considered\u2014chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives (CBRNE). With that said, the AFP requires the assistance of personnel from the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization (ANSTO) and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) to conduct investigations and examinations in environments containing radiological and nuclear (RN) hazards and to examine evidence that contains RN hazards. Crime scene personnel and laboratory staff are trained to enter CB contaminated environments in various levels of personal protective equipment to process exhibits and scenes, collect appropriate evidence, and document accordingly. AFP scientists regularly exercise with personnel from other emergency agencies, such as the fire brigade and ambulance, and from ANSTO and ARPANSA to coordinate efforts at the scene and ensure that the scene is processed logically and thoroughly in a manner that will best collect pertinent evidence and thus can withstand strict legal scrutiny. Exhibit packaging, decontamination of packaged exhibits, chain of custody, and exhibit transport, receipt, security, and storage are protocols that are all well established. Where possible these are identical to or closely follow existing practices. This is important, as in a multiagency response situation, procedures are more likely to be followed when they are already normal, embedded best practice.

Triaging may be performed if it is suspected that exhibits contain, or are contaminated with, trace levels of CBRNE. This minimizes the risk of contamination of the main laboratory, ensuring that routine forensic investigations are not disrupted by investigations of this nature. The ERTL is a PC2 laboratory that in the event of a biological incident can be ramped up to mimic a PC3 laboratory level of containment. The ERTL houses a large Class 3 biological safety cabinet in the same format as that in the Mobilab (Figure 37.7\n), two large Class 2 biological safety cabinets, and a large fume hood that can accommodate four scientists simultaneously (Figure 37.8\n). Fume hood exhaust is passed through two HEPA filters and a charcoal filter prior to release into the atmosphere. When the fume hood is running, the atmospheric pressure within the ERTL is\nstrongly negative, which assists with the containment of potentially hazardous materials. The ERTL is also used when exhibits require analysis by scientists from a number of disciplines. The simultaneous examination of complex exhibits by multiple scientists is more efficient than consecutive examinations and also provides a forum through which plans can be developed to maximize the recovery of evidence. A third important use of the ERTL is as a surge capacity laboratory. Utilization of the ERTL for investigations that require the processing of large numbers of exhibits allows examinations to be conducted with less impact on the normal operation of the main laboratory.",

Part 3 of the National Health Security Act 2007\n(28) introduces a national regulatory scheme for biological agents of security concern. The list of SSBAs regulated under this legislation is shown in Table 37.1. Agents on the list are derived from the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Report on the Regulation and Control of Biological Agents, from which the COAG biological agents list was developed in 2006 (29). In the process of developing the list, nearly 200 biological agents were considered. The review included an assessment of terrorist interest, availability of the agent, ease of production, ease of dissemination for threat, morbidity/mortality of the agent, transmissibility of the agent, and difficulty to treat for consequence (30). The list was divided into two tiers\u2014tier 1 agents, which pose the highest security risk to Australia, and tier 2 agents, which pose a high security risk. The regulatory scheme was implemented by the Australian Department of Health and Aging in January 2009 for tier 1 agents and January 2010 for tier 2 agents. An important component of the regulatory scheme is the national register of Australian entities handling SSBAs. The scheme also provides an instrument through which the government can evaluate whether entities have legitimate purpose to handle SSBAs. If approved, entities must comply with the act's regulations and relevant standards, and all entities that handle SSBAs, temporarily or otherwise, must abide by the mandatory reporting requirements.",

Although only a small number of people died as a result of the U.S. anthrax incidents, the scale of the consequences, economic and otherwise, were almost tsunami- like in their impact and effect. The incident classically illustrated the need to treat such an incident as a whole of government (or at least multiagency) response.

This necessitated the rapid development of response protocols and procedures based on existing assets, which, in the early days following the U.S. anthrax letters, were informed and enacted by an immature response community. This is no longer the case. Australia has been proactive in putting in place appropriate protocols and procedures at a whole of government level, with the overall control residing with the Australian National Counter Terrorism Committee (NCTC). As the lead commonwealth law enforcement agency, the AFP has an important role in realizing the goals and objectives of the NCTC and the commonwealth government. As the only broad-based forensic provider for the commonwealth, forensic responsibilities also reside with the AFP. Given the federal nature of Australia, this necessarily means that the AFP works in concert with state and territory counterparts.

This is enhanced by the placement of these units under one portfolio and under one senior manager.

The role of the Australian CBRN Data Center is to interface between forensic practitioners and highly specialized organizations such as Australia's Defense Science and Technology Organization and the Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organization with whom AFP has formal cooperation agreements in place. Many hazard response agencies and law enforcement agencies normally do not have access to security classified information where information relevant to bioterrorism threats resides.

            "text": "In developing the capability of the AFP to respond to bioterrorism, it was important for it to be appropriate to the threat and to recognize the existing roles and responsibilities of other agencies. The first responders to most incidents in Australia are the hazard response agencies, usually within fire services. Following the U.S. terrorism incidents in 2001, Emergency Management Australia, the commonwealth government agency tasked with coordinating government responses to emergency events, rolled out off-the-shelf capabilities to such agencies to conduct presumptive field testing of potential biomaterials. In the event of a positive presumptive test, a sample(s) would then go to a laboratory within the Australian health network for confirmatory testing. The policing agencies are primarily responsible for the forensic investigation. In this respect, the AFP approach differs from that followed by most other Australian policing agencies. In broad terms, the AFP fills an important forensic role that sits between the hazard response agency and the health agency but to some extent is overlapping. In this role, the AFP aims to add value to the equation but not replicate. Hence, the AFP has invested in evaluating available field equipment with a view to adding value through these being used by a microbiologist with forensic training or crime scene operatives with appropriate training. It is the view of the AFP that where an incident warrants it, this forensic intervention can play an important role in reducing disruption to normal activities. As such incidents can be in significant transport hubs, the benefit of quick action is obvious. Further, early identification of the biological agent provides a sound basis from which protective strategies can be implemented to minimize risk to personnel and from which appropriate sampling strategies can be formulated. Development of the Mobilab and associated triage center (ERTL) is aimed at balancing the need to sample the potentially active agent while protecting staff and the community from contamination but also protecting potential broader forensic evidence that may be vital in subsequent investigation. The latter is just as important in dealing with hoaxes. Of course, this approach will only be successful if roles are understood and the role of the crime scene officers and forensic microbiologist is fully recognized and incorporated into the whole of agency response plans. It is our view that, in much of the world, this broader role for forensic personnel is still immature or not well recognized. The focus of the AFP forensic response is to continue to improve field testing to provide as full an answer as possible and as quickly as possible, while recognizing the gold standard for identification remains culture.",

A fundamental awareness has been installed across all AFP portfolios. Further, most AFP forensic disciplines have the capability to extend routine examinations to biologically contaminated scenes and exhibits. The safety of AFP personnel is an important consideration behind all AFP activities; hence the implementation of strategies to minimize risk is paramount. This includes ongoing training to maintain skills and knowledge in the use of personal protective equipment and handheld detectors for entry into potentially contaminated sites. It is also one of the primary reasons for establishment of a capacity to detect and identify biological agents at the scene. Early identification of the biological agent provides a sound basis from which protective strategies can be implemented to minimize risk and a sound basis from which strategies can be developed to maximize the evidence gathered from the scene. It also ensures that strategies can be implemented to minimize the risk of loss or contamination of biological evidence. This is particularly important given that the maintenance of the viability of biological agents is often vital for confirmatory identification and subsequent detailed physical, biochemical, metabolic, and genetic analyses.",
