PEDV infection causes acute enteritis in swine of all ages and is often fatal in neonatal piglets. It causes destruction of villous enterocytes and villous atrophy within the jejunum and ileum (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978; Kim and Chae, 2000), and there has been a high incidence of diarrhoea and death in neonatal piglets associated with PEDV infection which has become a major economic concern in Korea (Chae et al., 2000).",

In addition, it has been suggested that PCV2 may be involved in the pathogenesis of PEDV infection in neonatal piglets (Jung et al., 2005). Field observations suggest that severe diarrhoea occurs with PEDV in PCV2-infected piglets (C. Chae, personal observation). Recently, transplacental transmission of PCV2 was demonstrated in pregnant sows (Park et al., 2005) but interaction between PEDV and PCV2 has not been demonstrated. The object of the present study was to determine if congenital infection with PCV2 produced a longer clinical course and more severe histopathological lesions in pigs infected post-natally with PEDV.",

Thus a possible explanation for the difference between the dually and singularly infected pigs in terms of lesions could be the effect of PCV2.

There was villous atrophy and fusion of the enterocytes in which PEDV was shown to be replicating, indicating a direct pathogenic effect of the virus. As a result, PEDV replicated rapidly, destroying the villous enterocytes within 24 h of the initial infection. These changes decrease the intestinal surface and thereby limit number of available cells for replication of PEDV. Thus, after destroying the villous enterocytes, levels of PEDV in intestinal tissues were significantly decreased in later stages of the infection.",
