As we write this perspective article, the situation is still in its early stages in many regions of the world and is continually evolving. The practice of social distancing has entered daily lifestyles as individuals, governments, communities, industrial firms, and academic institutions come to grips with the challenges of minimizing the loss of human life in the face of an invisible contagion. We have all seen figures on \"flattening the curve\" to help spread out the impact on medical facilities. The coronavirus outbreak will diffuse, but behavioral actions are needed to mitigate the number of contractions, illnesses, and deaths. Some of the actions of social distancing include self-quarantining, avoiding large gatherings, working from home where possible, sending students back to their residences, providing online education, reducing travel (especially in confined and mass transportation modes), limiting visits to stores, and many other everyday activities. Many of these adjustments are in contradistinction to \"normal\" routines. At a time when we are being prevailed upon to come together and to support one another in society, we must learn to do so from a distance. But the behavior changes are necessary and some of them may provide useful insight for how we can facilitate transformations toward more sustainable supply and production.",

The implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on sustainability remains to be seen, but deep and pervasive societal changes are likely to unfold in the coming months and years. 1",

In this situation, regulatory, technological, and cultural changes occurred to address the failings highlighted by the calamity.

The post-crisis period will afford rare circumstances to shift supply and production systems toward a more desirable state. It is important that we plan for changes in public policy and financial investment rather than forego the opportunity because of a lack of timely action. One of our contentions, which we discuss later, is that we should not allow the macroeconomic system, global supply chains, and international trade relations as we have known them to revert to \"normal\" and \"business-as-usual\" once the most immediate phase of the current disaster has passed. It will be necessary to work assiduously to ensure the emergence and successful adoption of new types of economic development and governance models and these societal changes will require hard thinking, new behavior, and thoughtful action.",

In this way, robotics could contribute to the diffusion of off-site construction with triple bottom line benefits: economic due to higher productivity; environmental by enabling more precise construction that reduces the gap between designed and actual energy utilization; and social by potentially reducing on-site accidents.",

Numerous reports to date indicate that public health officials, hospital administrators, and numerous others have encountered regular and repeated misallocations and shortages of ventilators, personal protective equipment, and additional essential supplies-often with tragic and life-jeopardizing consequences. The timely implementation of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing technologies could in the future help to alleviate many of these bottlenecks and logistical complications. More specifically, blockchain, Internet of things (IoT), and radio-frequency identification (RFID) sensor technology provides for enhanced traceability and transparency in supply chains. In addition, monitoring systems based on IoT applications can be integrated with satellite technology and artificial intelligence. Such arrangements could save time, resources, and energy-especially at moments when it is important to know in real time where critical materials are situated in complex supply chains.",

The coronavirus outbreak exposes the vulnerability of overreliance on just-in-time (JIT) and lean delivery systems. Separate from current travails, there has been a long-running debate about whether JIT systems-which can be efficient in terms of resources and waste-are also environmentally sound (Baumer-Cardoso et al, 2020). We will likely see in their place implementation of smarter logistics systems, including reverse logistics for secondary materials and waste products and enabled by Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. For example, knowing the location of electronics and appliances and their components through such means makes local sourcing easier. Furthermore, replacement of extensive transportation of processed goods over long distances with intermediate storage, depots,and material reserves is likely to gain renewed attention as inventory-buffering strategies.",
