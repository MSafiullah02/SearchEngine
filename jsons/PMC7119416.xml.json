Stewart, who, in 1967, declared that the war against infectious diseases had been won. Almost 40 years later, it is clear that his announcement was both erroneous and premature. Moreover, his affirmation of victory over infectious microbes probably never will be realized. Unfortunately, his confident optimism resulted in reduced funding and, as a consequence, less available financial support for, and significant decline in, scientific pursuit in the areas of research, treatment and prevention of infectious diseases. Furthermore, in the ensuing years, the public health infrastructure suffered dramatic cutbacks\u2014funds that today are necessary to combat emerging and re-emerging diseases.",

Yet, this mosquito-borne virus, the West Nile virus, has in the past five years spread across the country from its original U.S. port of entry, New York City, to California and the western parts of Canada. In 2004 alone, there were 2,470 reported cases of West Nile virus infection and 88 related deaths in the United States.",

This viral infection first was recognized in Hong Kong in the fall of 2002 and spread quickly to other countries. In an unprecedented demonstration of rapid international collaboration among public health officials, healthcare providers and researchers, transmission patterns were detected, the pathogen was identified and its entire genome was mapped. These efforts probably prevented a global pandemic. As of July 2003, 8,098 cases had been observed, with 774 fatalities. Sixty-three cases\u2014without any deaths\u2014were reported in the United States.",

An estimated 10 to 20 percent of U.S. residents become infected with influenza, and despite availability of vaccine for the most vulnerable populations, up to 36,000 deaths are attributed annually to this disease. The natural reservoirs of influenza A viruses are aquatic birds. However, periodical transmissions of avian influenza to other mammals and species have resulted in permanent lineages of this virus in domestic poultry, pigs, horses and humans. The passage of avian viruses through pigs is one route for human infections, but transmission directly from chickens is more common.",

However, the virus continued to spread among wild birds and has again infected humans. It is assumed that human-to-human transmission also is occurring. To date, 55 human cases resulting in 42 deaths have been reported from Thailand and Vietnam. Some experts believe that if the emergent H5N1 influenza takes hold among the human population, it will put the 1918 flu pandemic to shame. The \u201cSpanish flu\u201d in 1918 is thought to have killed between 20 and 40 million people. H5N1 could be five times as devastating. The 1918 pandemic had a mortality rate of 2.5 percent. At present, the mortality rate of diagnosed H5N1 cases is approximately 75 percent. In this time of recent natural disasters in southeast Asia, the ability to impose strict health control measures is severely hampered by the breakdown of established public health measures.",

Dental care providers treat a broad range of adult, pediatric, elderly, healthy and impaired populations. As health care providers, we have a responsibility to protect the public. Maybe the time has come for dental health care providers to partake in the multidisciplinary task of disease tracking and reporting. With proper training, we would be able to shoulder a more active role in the discovery and containment of the next infectious pandemic. I believe our involvement would have a substantial impact and greatly benefit the health of all patients.",
