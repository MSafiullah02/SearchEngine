Beyond a simple increase in the number of cases, there can be an indication of an outbreak when the same exposure (risk factor) causes a cluster of cases (two and more cases simultaneously) with the same disease; the number of disease cases in a cluster must not necessarily be higher than expected (Ungchusak 2004) . For instance, a cluster of five cases with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) was identified in one community in southwest France in 2005. The outbreak investigation showed that all patients had consumed one brand of frozen beef burgers in the week before the onset of symptom. Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli 0157:H7) was identified as the cause of the disease (King et al. 2008 ). An outbreak investigation should also take place even if only one case of an unknown or an unusual disease occurs and if this disease is life threatening [e.g., avian flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)] (Timmreck 1994) .",

The last quarter of the 20th as well as the first years of the 21st century was rich regarding the discovery of new etiologic agents and diseases, among which were Legionella spp. and legionellosis, toxic shock syndrome associated with tampon use, E. coli 0157:H7 -potentially causing fatal hemolytic uremic syndrome, Ebola virus (which was sensationalized in the news media) -causing viral hemorrhagic fever, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), just to name a few (see Chapter 3 and Weber et al. 2001; Dwyer and Groves 2001; Hawker et al. 2005; Towner et al. 2008; Oxford et al. 2003) .

In order to assess the existence of an outbreak, diagnosis of the suspected cases should be confirmed and then the number of detected cases should be compared with the baseline rate for the disease and setting. Possible biases which can influence the evaluation of an outbreak must be taken into account; first of all, changes in reporting practices, changes in population size, improved diagnostic procedures or screening campaigns (detection bias), or increased interest of the public and media in certain diseases (Gerstman 2003) . Often it might also be helpful to interview several representative cases. That can help to understand the clinical picture of the disease and obtain additional information about the affected individuals. The collection of epidemiological data is important for the development of prevention and control measures. Based on the initial information, an epidemiological investigation can be planned and control measures can be implemented immediately to stop further transmission of a disease (Dwyer and Groves 2001) .",

Examples A and B represent an epidemic curve for a propagated (continuing or progressive) source outbreak. Propagated outbreaks depend on transmission from person to person or continuing exposure from a single source (Gerstman 2003) . Curve A illustrates an outbreak (e.g., measles, influenza, or chickenpox) with a single exposure and index cases (index cases are those that first come to the attention of public health authorities) (Friis and Sellers 2004) . Curve B shows the incidence of secondary and tertiary cases, typical, for example, for hepatitis A (secondary cases are those who acquire disease from contact with primary cases and tertiary cases are those who acquire disease from contact with secondary cases). In such a propagated outbreak, as it is shown in part B, there first occurs an increase in cases after exposure, then a fall in the incidence of cases; later there occurs a second increase in cases eventually infected by person-to-person transmission from primary cases. Curves C and D of Fig. 9. 2 are examples of common source outbreaks. In such outbreaks most cases are exposed to one risk factor. Part C is a possible example for an outbreak when the number of cases rises suddenly and then slowly falls again. This is characteristic of a common source outbreak with a point exposure when the population at risk is exposed simultaneously within a short period of time. In this instance the epidemic ends, unless secondary cases occur, which is typical for foodborne outbreaks. Another example of the point source outbreak is Legionnaires' disease, which broke out among people who attended a convention of the American Legion in Philadelphia in 1976 (Arias 2000) . In part D there is a continued (intermittent) exposure of individuals; cases of disease occur suddenly after the minimum incubation period, but do not disappear completely, because more individuals continue to be exposed to the source of infection.",

It is practical to present geographical information in the form of maps, for example, dot density maps and choropleth maps. Dot density maps may serve to graphically present the geographical extent of the problem and provide information on clustering. Probably the most famous dot density map was drawn by John Snow, showing the cholera deaths near the Golden Square in London (where the outbreak occurred) in 1854 (McLeod 2001) . From his map, one could recognize the connection between clustering of cholera cases around the Broad Street pump, thus, the water-borne nature of the infectious agent (Gerstman 2003) . However, the disadvantage of dot density maps is that they do not provide any information concerning the number of people at risk in a mapped area, which can be confusing when populations of these areas are unequal in size. Another option is to build a map, which shows area-specific disease rates, for example, disease attack rates per 100 inhabitants showing epicenters of an epidemic.",

A foodborne disease outbreak (FBDO) is defined as an incident in which two or more persons experience a similar illness resulting from the ingestion of a common food (Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2008).

In case of such an outbreak, first, investigators list all food and drinks served at the dinner. Next, they divide guests into those who consumed a certain food or drink and those who did not. After that the attack rate in each of the groups is calculated using the formula for attack rate given above. The next step is to find a difference in attack rates between the two groups. The food or drink items which show the biggest differences in attack rates can be responsible for an outbreak of disease (Friis and Sellers 2004) .
