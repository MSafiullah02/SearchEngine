To estimate the amount of immune stimulation, nasal immune responses were examined during rhinovirus and RSV-induced URTI in infants. Nasal brush samples were taken from infants (2-26 months; 57% atopic family) with rhinovirus-induced URTI (N \u00bc 20), with RSV-induced URTI (N \u00bc 7), and with rhinovirus-induced rhinitis (N \u00bc 11), from children with asymptomatic rhinovirus infection (N \u00bc 7) and from eight non-infected children. Numbers of nasal brush cells positive for Th1-, Th2-, regulatory and proinflammatory cytokines were measured by immunohistochemistry or by measuring protein levels using a cytometric bead array analysis. During rhinovirus and RSVinduced URTI, fewer regulatory cytokine IL-10 positive cells were found compared to noninfected children. This fall was accompanied by an increase in levels of the Th1 cytokine TNFa. IL-10 responses were inversely related to TNFa responses. No enhanced responses were observed for IFNg, IL-12 and IL-18. Cytokine responses were comparable in children with rhinovirusinduced URTI and in children with rhinitis, while responses in asymptomatic rhinovirus-infected children were located between those for symptomatic and asymptomatic rhinovirus-infected children. Cytokine responses did not depend on the age of the child or atopy in the family. In conclusion, reduced nasal IL-10 responses during URTI in infants could facilitate the induction of a TNFa response. TNFa in turn could replace the immature production of IL-12, IL-18 and IFNg during URTI to induce an effective clearance of",

This is largely due to the immaturity of the child immune system, exemplified by the low levels of protective antibody production against common pathogens in infants [Brandenburg et al., 1997] . While a strong Th1-mediated response is required for the efficient eradication of respiratory pathogens [Papadopoulos et al., 2002] , in vitro studies showed not only that cord-blood cells in infants produce lower levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokines after stimulation compared to peripheral blood cells in adults [Lee et al., 1996; Sautois et al., 1997; Chalmers et al., 1998 ], but also that infants favour the production of Th2 cytokines over Th1 cytokines [Prescott et al., 1998; Ribeiro-do-Couto et al., 2001] . As a possible consequence, children in the first 2 years of life suffer on average from 6 to 8 respiratory infections a year. With the maturation of the immune system, this gradually declines to 3-4 a year in schoolage children [Denny, 1995] .",

This response is characterised by the production of increased levels of TNFa protein. In contrast to adult responses during URTI [Corne et al., 2001] , no response was observed in children involving the Th1-related cytokines IFNg and IL-12, or proinflammatory cytokine IL-18. The immaturity of the in vivo IFNg and IL-12 response is probably a reflection of in vitro data showing a low IFNg and IL-12 response in neonatal dendritic cells and T lymphocytes after polyclonal stimulation [Chalmers et al., 1998; Langrish et al., 2002] . The data suggest that the Th1 response in infants, in the absence of normal adult-like IFNg and IL-12 responses, largely depends on the increase in TNFa during URTI and that immune responses are only partially mature. The induction of a TNFa response during URTI is likely to result from the concomitant reduction in numbers of cells positive for the regulatory cytokine IL-10 during URTI. The inverse relation between IL-10 and TNFa responses suggested the alleviation of a suppressive effect of IL-10 on the expression of TNFa during URTI. Furthermore, we were able to show that the amount of IL-10 and TNFa response was unrelated to the severity of upper respiratory tract symptoms since comparable responses were observed in children with rhinovirus-induced URTI or rhinovirusinduced rhinitis.",

What is similar between adults and children is that in both it is the epithelium cells of the nasal mucosa that produces IL-10. In immunohistochemical stainings no evidence was found for extensive IL-10 production by dendritic cells or T lymphocytes, with close all IL-10 positive staining cells being identified as epithelial cells.

IL-10 is a regulatory cytokine with anti-inflammatory and Th2-stimulating properties that is mainly produced by monocytes, macrophages, and (regulatory) T lymphocytes. This cytokine can inhibit directly the production of a wide range of cytokines, such as the Th1-related cytokines TNFa, IFNg, IL-2, and IL-12 [Shin et al., 1999; Opal and DePalo, 2000] , the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18 [Marshall et al., 1999] , and the Th2-related cytokine IL-5 [Schandene et al., 1994] . In this capacity, IL-10 can regulate immune responses by either preventing an inflammatory response or by limiting excessive ongoing inflammation [Akdis and Blaser, 2001] . Therefore, in adults, the induction of IL-10 during infection probably reflects the deactivation of inflammatory responses. This is supported by the observation that low production levels of IL-10 generally lead to more severe disease [Morrison et al., 2000] .",

These high levels of IL-10 during infancy could be a reflection of the IL-10 rich environment that prevails during pregnancy [Piccinni, 2002] . Suppression of the maternal and fetal immune responses by this cytokine seems to be necessary to maintain pregnancy and ensure survival of the fetal allograft. Additionally, an active role for IL-10 during infancy is suggested by the presence of IL-10 in breast milk [Garofalo et al., 1995] . The high natural expression of IL-10 in infancy could limit immune responses to foreign antigens to which the child is newly exposed to after birth. In this way, tolerance is induced against relatively harmless antigens, preventing chronic inflammation after every single antigen encounter [Levings and Roncarolo, 2000; Groux, 2001] .",

Type I interferons have been described as inhibiting IL-10 production by activated human monocytes. On the other hand, these cytokines also stimulate IL-10 production in T lymphocytes [Feng et al., 2002] . As increased IFNa production is common in adults with naturally acquired influenza virus infection [Kaiser et al., 2001] and in infants with lower respiratory tract infections [Moulin et al., 1996] , up-regulation of this cytokine during URTI in children may explain the suppression of IL-10 responses. Alternatively, TGFb has also been shown to inhibit IL-10 mRNA synthesis in monocytes [Suberville et al., 2001] . Although, in general, TGFb production is up-regulated during influenza virus infection in mice [Schultz-Cherry and Hinshaw, 1996] , it is not known whether this is also the case in infants during respiratory infection and could therefore explain the down-regulation of IL-10 responses. Bont et al. [2000] suggested that the high natural expression of IL-10 in infants may underlie their high susceptibility to respiratory infections and infectionrelated wheezing episodes. They observed that high levels of IL-10 produced by monocytes after bronchiolitis correlated with high numbers of wheezing episodes following infection. Our data also suggest a similar relation between IL-10 and wheezing. However, these observations should be considered cautiously as only a limited number of children are involved.",

            "text": "In adults, in addition to a TNFa response, there is also an increase in levels of Th1 cytokine IFNg during URTI [Corne et al., 2001] . Other studies have found an increased production of Th1-related cytokines IL-12 and IFNg protein when adult PBMCs were infected with rhinovirus [Papadopoulos et al., 2002] , and an increased production of proinflammatory cytokine IL-18 by peripheral macrophages infected by influenza A virus [Sareneva et al., 1998 ]. Neonatal cord-blood dendritic cells are also capable of producing IL-12 after stimulation with influenza virus [Bartz et al., 2002] . We had therefore expected to find a similar increase in these cytokine responses during URTI in infants. However, we were not able to detect any differences in cell numbers for IL-12 or IL-18 positive cells or IFNg protein levels in nasal brush samples of rhinovirus-or RSVinfected children compared to non-infected children. Data from other studies suggest that the lack of IL-12, IL-18, and IFNg responses during URTI could be a direct reflection of the immaturity of the child's immune system [Cohen et al., 1999] . LPS stimulated neonatal DCs fail to produce IL-12p70 or induce levels of IFNg production by T lymphocytes comparable to those in adults [Langrish et al., 2002] . Interestingly, in the same experiment, levels of IL-10 and TNFa production by LPS-stimulated neonatal DCs were directly comparable with those of adult DCs. Similarly, foetal and neonatal mononuclear cells are not able to produce IL-2, IL-4, or IFNg, while IL-10, IL-6, and TNFa was secreted spontaneously and enhanced after polyclonal stimulation [Zhao et al., 2002] . Our results are directly in agreement with these in vitro data that point to a largely immature immune system in infants that is able to mount correct IL-10 and TNFa responses upon infection, but fails to induce proper IL-12, IL-18 and IFNg responses. It could therefore be the case that the mature production of TNFa during URTI replaces immature IL-12, IL-18 and IFNg responses in infants in order to induce a host immune response that is capable of clearing the viral infection.",

            "text": "Could these viral URTIs influence the maturation of the immune system in infants? As postulated in the hygiene hypothesis, childhood infections may stimulate immune maturation from neonatal Th2 cytokine responses towards adult-like Th1 responses by repeated Th1 stimulation [Strachan, 2000] . As we found that rhinovirus and RSV were capable of inducing Th1 host immune responses, characterised by increased TNFa production, repeated URTIs may indeed stimulate immune maturation. Cytokine responses did not differ according to the severity of rhinovirus infection and this suggests that the immune stimulatory effects of URTI and rhinitis are comparable. Furthermore, even an asymptomatic rhinovirus infection may stimulate immune maturation, as a trend towards decreased IL-10 and increased TNFa responses was observed during this type of infection in infants. Whether Th1 stimulation by respiratory infections is optimal is unknown, as infants lack the ability to produce Th1-related and the proinflammatory cytokines IFNg, IL-12 and IL-18. Further study is needed to determine whether URTI can indeed stimulate neonatal immune maturation.",
