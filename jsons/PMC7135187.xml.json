Subsequently, pre-vaccine era morbidity (15% to 20% hospitalization rates) returned.5 Replacement ADV vaccines are under development but years away from licensure. ARD vaccine arsenals currently consist of measles-mumps-rubella, meningococcal, and influenza vaccines.6, 7 The potential use of pneumococcal vaccines is being assessed for military use.8 Despite vaccine preventive measures, military trainee and other populations living in close contact continue to suffer from respiratory disease outbreaks.5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13\n",

This study focuses on prevention of communicable respiratory diseases, and NOVARDIs that would not significantly interfere with standard operating procedures for training programs nor require human-use study protocols (such as for a study of medications or herbal supplements). Feasible personal hygiene, and administrative and environmental control measures, if not cost prohibitive, could be implemented in a reasonable time or included in new building construction.",

Published and unpublished reports were studied to assess their potential effectiveness, the scientific rationale for their implementation, and feasibility for use in military training centers. The findings of this study may be relevant to other populations, particularly those with people living in close contact, as found in educational settings, training camps, on ships, and in correctional facilities.9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Because the military is a defined and regimented population, it lends itself to the study of NOVARDIs. The results from military studies may be extrapolated to similar civilian settings. Furthermore, the preventive measures reviewed may have an impact on the control of other agents such as noroviruses and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.",

Between 2000 and 2004, literature searches were conducted through MEDLINE (1963 to 2004) and the Technical Reports Collection on the Scientific and Technical Information Network of the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) (1974 to 2004). Other unpublished reports were identified by senior military officials. Bibliographies from identified articles, military publications, and studies in the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board (AFEB), Falls Church VA, archives were also reviewed.15 Reviews focused on population-based studies in communities, as opposed to healthcare settings. Studies that examined other outcomes (e.g., gastrointestinal diseases), were not population-based, were in a healthcare setting, or were not in a final report form or available through DTIC, were excluded from this study. However, some excluded references served as secondary sources of information and are mentioned in the discussion section of this paper. Existing scientific data, applicability, feasibility, and economic impact were considered for selected NOVARDIs. Recommendations were categorized using a modified classification system of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (CDC/HICPAC).16\n",

The intervention trials were limited in that compliance and quality of handwashing were not quantified, and two of the trials did not have concurrent control groups, but rather compared disease rates with the previous years\u2019 rates.22, 27 The observation studies were limited by their reliance on self-administered questionnaires to determine the extent of handwashing.22, 23\n",

The study from Fort Humphreys had incomplete controls of confounders and incomplete density assessment. Due to the poor living conditions, the studies of children may not be generalized to all populations. Despite these flaws, the conclusion from these studies was that reducing crowding would have a favorable impact on the occurrence of ARD. Medical literature queries on \u201chead-to-toe\u201d sleeping arrangements to increase the distance between personal breathing zones yielded no studies. The aforementioned study at Fort Humphreys discussed the use of cloth barriers/curtains (also called \u201csneeze sheets\u201d) to form \u201ccubicles\u201d for separate beds; the authors attribute one group\u2019s low incidence of influenza to the use of separation curtains. However, there was inadequate controls of other factors to assertively conclude a positive effect.",

Two studies addressing indoor air exchanges by dilution ventilation were identified. A study at Fort Benning GA, published in 1988, noted that modern, energy-efficient Army barracks had significantly higher ARD rates than drafty, older barracks at the same Army post (adjusted relative risk=1.51; 95% confidence interval=1.46\u20131.56).37 This study, however, had little quantification of barracks\u2019 ventilation. During an ADV type-4 outbreak at Fort Benning in 2000, lack of mechanical ventilation was significantly associated with infection in univariate analysis; however, since no cases slept in areas with operating air handlers, mechanical ventilation could not be included in the multivariate analysis.31\n",

These recommendations are based on well-designed experimental, clinical, or epidemiologic studies (Category IA). Authors of these recommendations point out studies that show plain soap failing to remove organisms, and the possibility of contamination of soap or soap dishes.16 One study concluded that handwashing was generally less effective than hand rubs.56 Another review of hand antiseptics and viruses found experimental evidence demonstrating that some formulations of hand rubs, particularly those with alcohol, outperformed regular handwashing.57 Studies of an alcohol-based hand rub found a decrease in school absenteeism and infections in an extended care facility when hand rubs were made available; however, the effect on respiratory disease could not be determined since the studies did not analyze absenteeism by cause.58, 59, 60 As demonstrated in a study of Air Force recruits, handwipes with PCMX are effective against ARD,24 in spite of the CDC recommendations on hand hygiene for healthcare workers, which states that antimicrobial-impregnated wipes are not as effective as hand rubs.16\n",

A different method of cohorting, which is practiced in military basic training centers, involves minimizing contact between training companies of approximately 100 to 200 people. Population-based evidence for the effectiveness of cohorting was observed during Marine initial entry training, but not later in advanced training, when companies had more contact with other companies.29 Evidence of the effect of cohorting is suggested by the way clusters of cases occur during initial entry training. In two outbreaks in 199730 and 199831 at Fort Jackson SC, company-specific attack rates and temporal progression of ADV-associated ARD cases supported the spread of infection by cohorts. Thus, interruption of outbreaks may be possible if contact between members of separate training companies could be avoided early. In an ADV type-4 outbreak in 2000 at Fort Benning,32 the involvement of only one training company, atypical of previous ADV type-4 outbreaks, may have been explained by the limited degree of interaction by members of that company with other trainees at the time. While cohorting may seem like an attractive control measure, current training structures (barracks, classrooms, dining, recreational, and medical facilities) may make it difficult to effectively isolate groups from one another for a significant amount of time.",

Currently, overcrowding, especially during the summer surge when large numbers of high school graduates enter military training, may be a problem. The Army Medical Department has historically recommended adequate living space to decrease the spread of infectious diseases even though the definition of \u201cadequate\u201d is debatable.14 Despite this long-standing concern, population-derived evidence supporting \u201cadequate\u201d space is lacking. Recommendations for space and ventilation dating back to 1772 are not based on controlled studies or well-designed observational studies, but rather on theory, expert or personal opinions, or limited observation.14, 67 In 1924, examining data from the influenza pandemic during World War I, Army Medical Department reviewers established standards of 60 ft2 of floor space and 720 ft3 of area per person in barracks.14, 67 Data from Camp Humphreys VA, supported these recommendations, although data from other posts were less convincing.33 The current space allocation guidelines specify 72 ft2 of floor space per soldier, with a minimum of 55 ft2 that can be reduced to 40 ft2 in temporary emergency situations.14, 68 These requirements exceed the standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers, Inc.

The list of potential NOVARDIs is extensive and many were not considered in this report. For example, cleansing of common surfaces and management of symptomatic personnel were not evaluated. Before the 1990s, military medical treatment facilities had liberal hospitalization policies for ARD. These policies, however, have been significantly modified in recent years with the advent of managed care. The question of whether this change influenced the spread of respiratory disease is in debate.74 Other prevention interventions that were not reviewed in this study include medications, supplements, and alternative medicine interventions (e.g., vitamin C, zinc, and Echinacea). This study reviewed and referenced some policy documents from the U.S. Army; however, instructions and polices from the other military services were not included. The literature review for this study may have also missed relevant reports due to differences in keyword search phrasing, and specificity in choosing only population-based studies. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that robust, population-based evidence is lacking for the NOVARDIs examined. Most potential methods for interrupting the transmission of respiratory disease agents are not well understood or documented. Therefore, designing studies to evaluate NOVARDIs is challenging. Complicating factors include low infecting dose,75 varying degrees of communicability for different pathogens,76 and multiple modes for transmission.77\n",

Logistic and economic practicality will vary based on many factors including facility infrastructure.

The threat that a highly transmissible, highly virulent respiratory disease agent can present, such as SARS-associated coronavirus, and for which there is no effective vaccine or antimicrobial drug, requires both military and civilian leaders to give NOVARDIs much greater consideration in community settings than has been traditionally given. Further study of NOVARDIs, to include analysis of cost and benefits derived, is warranted.",
