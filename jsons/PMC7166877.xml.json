            "text": "Otitis media is one of the most common infectious diseases in childhood and the main reason for physician visits, antibiotic prescriptions and surgery in children, thereby causing a significant burden on the healthcare system and the economy [Rovers et al., 2004]. In acute otitis media, middle ear effusion is present behind the tympanic membrane with signs of middle ear inflammation. The presence of middle ear effusion without acute inflammation, either persisting after acute otitis media or occurring de novo, is defined as otitis media with effusion. Although acute otitis media is generally considered to be a bacterial infection, it is acknowledged that respiratory viruses play a role in the development of acute otitis media by increasing the adherence of bacteria to epithelial cells and by virus\u2010induced dysfunction of the Eustachian tube, which interferes with clearance of middle ear effusion. In addition, host\u2010mediated responses to viral infections such as production of cytokines and inflammatory mediators may contribute to the pathology of otitis media [Heikkinen and Chonmaitree, 2003; Nokso\u2010Koivisto et al., 2006]. The persistence of viruses in the middle ear may also lead to relapse of acute otitis media, even if the initial acute otitis media episode was cleared, and may therefore contribute to the long\u2010term presence of middle ear effusion [Rovers et al., 2004].",

            "text": "Using culture methods, viruses have been found in the nasopharynx of 30\u201350% of children with acute otitis media and in 10\u201320% of middle ear effusion specimens [Heikkinen and Chonmaitree, 2003]. The use of more sensitive PCR techniques and the ability to detect novel viruses such as human bocavirus (HBoV), polyomaviruses (PyV), human metapneumovirus, and human rhinovirus C (HRV C) described recently has significantly increased these percentages, with one study indicating that a virus was present in the nasopharynx of approximately 90% of children with acute otitis media [Heikkinen and Chonmaitree, 2003]. Studies showing protection against acute otitis media development by immunization with influenza vaccines and the demonstration that experimental viral infection of healthy volunteers resulted in otologic changes, further suggest a role for viruses in acute otitis media pathogenesis [Buchman et al., 2002; Marchisio et al., 2009]. Data is inconsistent regarding the importance of specific viruses in acute otitis media. In studies using viral culture and antigen detection methods, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most prevalent virus in the nasopharynx and middle ear of children with acute otitis media, whereas a study using PCR assays indicated that human rhinovirus (HRV) was predominant [Pitkaranta et al., 1998; Heikkinen et al., 1999; Yano et al., 2009]. To gain a better understanding of the potential role for specific viruses in otitis media, a multiplex real\u2010time PCR (RT PCR) and traditional PCR assays were used to determine the presence of nucleic acids of human rhinoviruses (HRV; types A, B, and C), respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV; types A and B), bocavirus (HBoV), adenovirus (HAdV), enterovirus (EV), coronaviruses (CoV; types 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43), influenza viruses (types A, B, and C), parainfluenza viruses (PIV; types 1, 2, 3, 4A, and 4B), human metapneumovirus (HMV), and polyomaviruses (PyV; types KI and WU) in the nasopharynx of children between 6 and 36 months of age either with (n = 180) or without (n = 66) a history of recurrent acute otitis media and in 238 middle ear effusion samples collected from 143 children with persistent middle ear effusion due to recurrent acute otitis media. The association of the presence of specific viruses in the nasopharynx and the middle ear of children with a history of recurrent acute otitis media was investigated to determine the capacity of specific viruses to enter and/or persist in the middle ear. In addition, specific associations between viral and bacterial pathogens were investigated. Together this data will further the understanding of the potential role for specific viruses in otitis media and may contribute to the design of better treatment and prevention strategies for otitis media.",

Cases were defined as children with a history of at least three episodes of acute otitis media requiring the insertion of ventilation tubes. Children requiring the insertion of ventilation tubes for persistent middle ear effusion without a history of acute otitis media were not included. Children undergoing general surgery (predominantly orthopedics, strabismus, circumcision, cryptorchidism, hypospadias repair) and with no history of any form of otitis media, were recruited as healthy controls. At the time of surgery, children were in good health with no evidence of fever or viral infection. Children with diagnosed immunodeficiency, cystic fibrosis, immotile cilia syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, and chromosomal or genetic syndromes were excluded. Data on ear disease history and host\u2010 and environmental risk factors were collected by parental questionnaire and from medical records. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Western Australia and by ethics committees and the institutional boards of hospitals in Perth where recruitment took place.

Briefly, nucleic acid was extracted from a 200 \u00b5l volume of sample using a modified liquid sample extraction protocol on an automated extraction instrument (Xtractorgene, CAS1820, Corbett, Brisbane, Australia). Standardized amounts of equine herpesvirus and MS2 RNA coliphage were added to the lysis buffer to monitor the efficiency of sample extraction, the removal of PCR inhibitors and the cDNA process. Negative controls were included in the extraction process after every five clinical samples and treated as samples for the completion of the assay. Nucleic acid (8 \u00b5l) was added to two multiplex PCR mixes (12 \u00b5l) containing 27 and 7 primer pairs. Following 20 amplification cycles, liquid handling robots were used to transfer 1 \u00b5l of a 1:10 dilution of that product to several RT PCR (20 \u00b5l) mixes containing 2\u20133 primer pairs. RT PCRs (40 cycles) were conducted in Rotor\u2010Gene 6000 instruments (Corbett, Brisbane, Australia). The multiplex RT PCR assay detects adenovirus types B\u2013E, bocavirus, coronavirus types 229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63, influenza virus types A\u2013C, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134, polyomavirus types KI and WU, and RSV types A and B. Separate semi\u2010nested PCR assays were performed to detect enterovirus, HRV and human metapneumovirus and PCR products were further characterized by DNA sequencing. Additional characterization of the HRV types utilized primers directed against the VP1 and VP4/2 regions of the genome [Coiras et al., 2004; Ledford et al., 2004; McIntyre et al., 2010].",

The high detection rates in this study support recent findings from Singleton et al. that showed that 90% of children hospitalized for respiratory infections and 52% of healthy controls had a virus detected in the nasopharynx when using PCR for the detection of seven respiratory viruses, which are similar rates as detected in a case\u2013controfl study from the Netherlands where samples were investigated for the presence of eight respiratory viruses [van Gageldonk\u2010Lafeber et al., 2005; Singleton et al., 2010]. In contrast, a study by Winther et al. [2007] detected lower virus rates (18.2%) in children without respiratory symptoms despite using PCR techniques, however, PCRs were only performed for the identification of six respiratory viruses.",

Longitudinal studies have also demonstrated that the presence of a virus in the nasopharynx is associated with the subsequent development of otitis media [Winther et al., 2007; Chonmaitree et al., 2008; Alper et al., 2009]. None of these studies had as high detection rates as described in the current study, potentially because a wider range of viruses, such as the more recently discovered HBoV, polyomaviruses, and human metapneumovirus, was tested for here. In addition, molecular methods were used for the detection of all viruses, whereas other studies used combinations of PCR\u2010, antigen detection\u2010, and culture methods.",

            "text": "Data on the importance of specific viruses in otitis media remain conflicting [Heikkinen and Chonmaitree, 2003; Nokso\u2010Koivisto et al., 2006]. Even though in the current study the classical otitis\u2010prone definition was not used [Howie et al., 1975], children were at the severe end of the otitis media spectrum with a median of seven acute otitis media episodes before the insertion of ventilation tubes. The difference in detection rates of viral nucleic acids in the nasopharynx between this group and a group of children without a history or recurrent acute otitis media was most significant for RSV with an odds ratio of 9.1, supporting a potential role for RSV in otitis media as described by others [Heikkinen et al., 1999; Patel et al., 2007; Yano et al., 2009]. HRV nucleic acid was the type detected most frequently in the middle ear (46%) of children with a history of recurrent acute otitis media which is in accordance with several other studies and suggests HRV may be important in otitis media [Pitkaranta et al., 1998; Blomqvist et al., 2002; Nokso\u2010Koivisto et al., 2004; Chantzi et al., 2006; Kleemola et al., 2006; Ruohola et al., 2006]. This role for HRV in otitis media may be attributable to the capacity of HRV to induce the release of bacteria from biofilm [Chattoraj et al., 2011] or the persistence of HRV in adenoid tissue [Pitkaranta et al., 2002; Rihkanen et al., 2004]. In addition to the classical HRV species A and B, a third rhinovirus species, HRV C, was identified recently [Arden et al., 2006; Lamson et al., 2006]. It has been suggested that HRV C causes more severe disease, however, debate is ongoing [Arden and Mackay, 2010; Gern, 2010]. HRV A was the predominant HRV type in the nasopharynx and middle ear effusion of children with a history of recurrent acute otitis media described here, whereas HRV C was the most common type in the nasopharynx of healthy children, which does not support a predominant role for HRV C compared to other HRV types in otitis media. In addition, it was demonstrated that in children with a history of recurrent acute otitis media, HRV A accounted for 64/105 (61%) of rhinovirus isolates from the NPS and 41/66 (62.1%) of isolates from the middle ear effusion. HRV C accounted for 39/105 (37.1%) of HRV in the NPS and 26/66 (39.4%) in the middle ear effusion, indicating that neither of the types preferentially resides in the nasopharynx or the middle ear. To our knowledge only one study has investigated HRV types in children with acute otitis media, which found a similar proportion (\u223c50%) of HRV A and HRV C in the nasopharynx and middle ear effusion during acute otitis media [Savolainen\u2010Kopra et al., 2009] supporting our data that there seems to be no difference between the HRV types in their capacity to enter and/or persist in the middle ear.",

            "text": "HBoV was the second most common virus detected in the nasopharynx (52.2%) and middle ear effusion (8.4%) of children with a history of recurrent acute otitis media. Since the discovery of HBoV in 2005 [Allander et al., 2005] debate on the role of HBoV in respiratory disease has been ongoing. Detection rates of HBoV in the nasopharynx of asymptomatic children vary widely from <10% [Kesebir et al., 2006; Brieu et al., 2008; Garcia\u2010Garcia et al., 2008; von Linstow et al., 2008] to two studies describing an infection rate of 40% [Longtin et al., 2008; Martin et al., 2010]. The findings in these latter studies which included otitis\u2010prone children were similar to our observations for children with a history of recurrent acute otitis media. In the current study the detection rate of HBoV nucleic acid in the middle ear effusion was relatively low compared to the detection rate of HBoV in the nasopharynx, which is in agreement with findings from others [Ruohola et al., 2006; Beder et al., 2009; Rezes et al., 2009]. Additional viruses discovered recently, the polyomaviruses KI (KIPyV) and WU (WUPyV) [Allander et al., 2007; Gaynor et al., 2007] were detected in the nasopharynx of 15.2% of healthy controls and 36.1% of children with a history or recurrent acute otitis media. These rates are high compared with other studies where WUPyV and KIPyV is detected in 1\u20136% of respiratory tract secretions collected during acute respiratory disease [Babakir\u2010Mina et al., 2011], but they are more similar to a recent study where KIPyV and WUPyV were detected by real\u2010time PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs from 7 (3.0%) and 38 (16.4%) of 232 children with respiratory tract infections [Teramoto et al., 2011]. In addition, the seroprevalence of KIPyV and WUPyV in adults is 55% and 69%, respectively, suggesting that exposure to these viruses, probably in childhood, is very common [Kean et al., 2009]. The fact that in the current study nucleic acid from HBoV, KIPyV, and WUPyV were detected frequently in asymptomatic controls and not commonly in middle ear effusion samples, may suggest their role in otitis media is limited, but further studies are required.",

Conversely, a virus that is detected on its own and not associated with other viruses, for example, HRV or adenovirus, may be more important in disease pathogenesis. In nasopharyngeal samples from children with a history of recurrent acute otitis media, a positive association of adenovirus with S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis was observed. A similar positive association between adenovirus and M. catarrhalis was found in children in a semi\u2010arid zone of Western Australia, however, a negative association between adenovirus and S. pneumoniae was described in this cohort when using adjusted statistical models [Jacoby et al., 2007; Moore et al., 2010]. A chinchilla model showing adenovirus does not promote otitis media due to M. catarrhalis or S. pneumoniae does not support results described in the current article [Bakaletz et al., 1995; Tong et al., 2000]. In the middle ear, a positive association between HRV and NTHi was observed which was not noted in the nasopharynx, which may suggest that interactions between pathogens are dependent on the local environment. These conflicting results highlight the complexity of pathogen interactions. The interpretation of data from animal models, different human populations, sampling environments, and various statistical models are challenging, further emphasizing that more studies are necessary.",
