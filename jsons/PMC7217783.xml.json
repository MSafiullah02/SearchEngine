These 177 patients came to medical attention for clinical evaluation of symptoms to our emergency departments, ambulatory clinics, inpatient units, or by referral for admission from external facilities. From these 177 infected patients, we identified cohorts of non-hospitalized (N=133) and hospitalized (N=44) patients. Of the 44 hospitalized patients, we identified cohorts of non-critically ill (N=35) and critically ill (N=9) patients. The objective of the study was to determine if specific epidemiologic and clinical patient characteristics were more likely to be associated with hospitalization and/or critical care. Data were extracted from medical records and recorded in a RedCap database, including age, sex, presence or absence of underlying medical condition and presence or absence of fever or respiratory symptoms (rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath), as well as other symptoms (diarrhea/vomiting, myalgia, chest pain, loss of sense of taste or smell, headache). The Fisher exact test was performed to examine differences in the distribution of categorical variables between hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized patients, as well as between hospitalized critically ill patients vs. non-critically ill patients. Continuous variables were evaluated using logistic regression. This project was submitted to the IRB and was determined to be a Quality Improvement initiative and not human subjects research.",
