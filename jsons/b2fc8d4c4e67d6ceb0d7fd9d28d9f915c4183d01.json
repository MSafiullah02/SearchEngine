            "text": "Veterinarians are in close contact with animals of different families, genera, and species. Many of these animals are large, unwieldy, and uncooperative during examination or treatment. It is quite common for veterinarians to receive bites, scratches, crush injuries, and low-back injuries from these animals. In Australia, 71% of veterinarians surveyed reported a lost time injury within the last 10 years from handling animals. In a survey of zoo veterinarians in the United States, 61.5% of respondents reported major animalrelated injury and 55% reported low-back injury. Full-time zoo veterinarians were more likely to report back injury and inadequate knowledge of occupational hazards (2, 4) . 270 J.E. Lessenger A survey of veterinarians in Minnesota and Wisconsin revealed that 64.6% of respondents had sustained a major animal-related injury in their careers. Seventeen percent were hospitalized within the last year, 25.3% requiring a surgical procedure. Hand injuries were most common in a veterinarian's career (52.6%), followed by trauma to the arms (27.6%) and the head (20.8%). The thorax (8.3%), genitalia (3.9%), and intraabdominal viscera (2.8%) were injured less often. Operative procedures were frequently required 21 . Disease and Injury Among Veterinarians 271 to treat veterinarian injury from animal patients. Thirty-five percent of veterinarians required treatment for suture of lacerations, 10% for reduction of fracture/dislocation, and 5% for dental work during their career. One craniotomy and one carotid artery repair were necessary. Mechanisms of injury were animal kick (35.5%), bite (34%), crush (11.7%), scratch (3.8%), and miscellaneous causes (14.9%), including the patient pushing, goring, head butting, running over, and falling on the veterinarian. Additional workrelated hazards included zoonotic disease, autoinoculation of live brucella vaccine, and self-inflicted scalpel injuries from sudden patient movement. The most common animals involved were bovine (46.5%), canine (24.2%), and equine (15.2%). Lost days from work secondary to animal injury averaged 1.3 days in 1986 and 8.5 days during the veterinarian's career. Jobrelated automobile accidents also occurred. Veterinarians averaged more than 300 miles driven per week, and only 56% reported following the speed limit. Fifteen percent did not wear seat belts. Self-treatment of injuries was common (5) . Even though animal bites are common and a real risk for rabies exists, surveys have demonstrated a relatively low rate of rabies immunization in veterinarians and veterinary workers. The cost of preexposure rabies vaccine was found to be a major barrier, especially in young, part-time workers (6) .",

Fifty-six percent of disease incidents were initially diagnosed by the veterinarians themselves. Fifty-three percent of incidents required treatment by a medical practitioner, but the majority (61%) of incidents did not require absence from work. The incidence density rate for contracting a zoonotic disease was 0.06 per person year of exposure. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis estimated that the probability of having contracted a zoonotic disease was 50% after 11 years in practice. The risk of contracting a zoonotic disease appeared to be higher early in practice, and the most common mode of transmission was by direct contact (8) .",

The ACGIH threshold limit value (TLV) time-weighted average (TWA) for halothane is 50 ppm and NIOSH has established 2 ppm as a recommended level based on a 1-hour sampling; OSHA has established no guideline for halothane. All veterinary clinics inspected had installed the passive waste gas scavenging system. Veterinarians' personal exposures for isoflurane ranged from 1.3 to 13 ppm, and for their assistants, personal exposures ranged from 1.2 to 9 ppm. Veterinarians' personal exposures for halothane ranged from 0.7 to 12 ppm; for their assistants, personal exposures ranged from 0.4 to 3.2 ppm. One clinic had significant leaks in the anesthetic gas delivery lines. Personal halothane exposure for the veterinarian at this clinic was 7.2 to 65 ppm.

Substances in this group include antibiotics, immunizations, hormones, anesthetics, steroids, disinfectants, sterilants, prostaglandins, special feed formulas, and insecticides. A good example is the accidental injection of brucellosis vaccine into the hand of the veterinarian as he gives an injection to an animal. The veterinarian is faced with multiple exposures including infection, tetanus, toxic injection injury, and an immunological response. Aggressive treatment with antibiotics, steroids, and sometimes surgery is often delayed by the reluctance of veterinarians to admit their injuries and their tendency for self-treatment.",

In particular, several studies have found increased risks of malignant lymphoma and soft tissue sarcoma in persons exposed to phenoxy herbicides. However, the evidence is inconsistent, and there is a wide variation in relative risk estimates. The second group of risk factors includes various animal viruses. There is currently little evidence concerning the zoonotic nature or human carcinogenicity of these viruses. However, an association has been suggested by recent evidence of increased risks of hematologic malignancies in abattoir workers, veterinarians, and meat inspectors. A third hypothesis, for which little evidence is currently available, is that agricultural work may involve prolonged antigenic stimulus leading to lymphoproliferation. The factors responsible for the increased risks for cancers other than hematologic malignancies are not well understood but may also involve exposure to chemicals or viruses (26) .",
