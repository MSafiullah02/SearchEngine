Formation of these structures involves rearrangement of host cell membranes and cytoskeleton and induces a \u2018cytopathic effect\u2019 indicative of virus infection. It is generally believed that factories and viroplasm create a platform to concentrate replicase proteins, virus genomes and host proteins required for replication, and at the same time physically separate replication sites from a myriad of cellular antiviral defences. The subversion of membrane trafficking pathways during the formation of replication sites may add further benefit by slowing the transport of immunomodulatory proteins to the surface of infected cells to protect against immune responses, while disruption of the cytoskeleton may enhance release of viruses from cells. There is growing interest in understanding how viruses induce such large changes in cellular organisation, and recent advances in electron microscopy coupled with tomography and live cell imaging are beginning to reveal the relationship between virus factories and viroplasm and the cellular structures that house them. In this review, we discuss how three supergroups of (+)strand RNA viruses generate replication sites from membrane-bound organelles and highlight research on perinuclear factories induced by the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV).",

The alphaviruses generate membrane invaginations called spherules [3], while the flaviviruses and coronaviruses generate networks of double membrane vesicles (DMVs) connected to a complex of convoluted membranes (CM) derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The picornaviruses also generate DMVs and a heterogeneous series of membrane vesicles and membrane rosettes [4, 5]. The formation of spherules, and possibly DMVs, parallels mechanisms of capsid assembly where ordered assembly of replicase proteins induces membrane curvature and invaginations of uniform diameter [2]. The more complex membrane rearrangements involving ER networks and CM may involve additional recruitment of host proteins that modulate SNAP (Soluble NSF [N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor] Attachment Protein) Receptor (SNARE) proteins and the Rab and Arf GTPases that control the secretory pathway (reviewed in [6]).",

Flock house virus (FHV) is a member of the Nodaviridae family (RdRp supergroup 1), which generates spherules in the outer membrane of mitochondria [8]. Each spherule contains approximately 100 copies of the replicase protein packed along the inner membrane surface [9\u2022\u2022]. Tomographic reconstructions show that spherule membranes are continuous with the outer mitochondrial membrane and that a membrane neck connecting the lumen of the spherule to the cytosol surrounds a channel wide enough to allow passage of (+)RNA into the cytosol [9\u2022\u2022]. Rubella virus is the only member of the Rubivirus genus of the Togaviridae, which are distantly related to the alphaviruses. Assembly of the rubella RdRp on the cytoplasmic face of endosomes and lysosomes generates spherules containing replicase proteins and double-stranded RNA. In some cases, the spherules grow into large vacuoles and rigid membrane rods and sheets possibly coated with RdRp. Freeze fracture studies and tomographic reconstitution have identified inter-connections between the vacuoles [7] and protein bridges connecting vacuoles to ER.",

Each spherical vesicle is connected to the ER membrane by a neck with a pore opening to the cytosol that could allow transit of viral RNA. In some images, the pores lie adjacent to sites of virus assembly making it possible that viral RNA passes directly from the spherical vesicles to budding viruses [10\u2022\u2022].",

Three-dimensional reconstructions of vesicles induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) show DMVs between 150 and 300 nm in size bounded by two tightly apposed membranes connected to ER [11\u2022\u2022]. SARS-CoV also induces CM containing small tubular and reticular membranes connected to the ER. Later during infection cells contain \u2018vesicular packets\u2019 where single membraned vesicles are surrounded by a common outer ER membrane [11\u2022\u2022]. The interior of the DMVs contains dsRNA but surprisingly, unlike DMVs generated by flaviviruses, the replicase proteins are absent from the DMVs but locate to the CM that lie between DMVs. This suggests that virus replication occurs in the CM rather than DMVs. Neck-like structures extending from DMVs to the outer ER membrane are visible, but evidence for a pore connected to the cytosol is lacking. Enveloped SARS-CoV can be detected in the vesicular packets. This suggests that replication may take place on CM and that genomes are transferred to vesicular packets for envelopment and budding, while excess viral RNA may be stored in DMVs.",

The nature and relative numbers of vesicles vary greatly depending on the picornavirus family and it is not clear which population of vesicles house the replication complex.

            "text": "Double-membraned vesicles are usually rare in cells, but DMVs are induced during autophagy. This makes it possible that autophagosomes may provide a source for DMVs associated with virus replication. A role for autophagosomes in supporting replication of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was first provided by studies where mouse embryonic stem cells lacking crucial autophagy protein Atg5 showed a 1000-fold reduction in MHV replication and reduced numbers of DMVs [34]. Less clear-cut results come from studies of primary fibroblasts or macrophages where loss of Atg5 has little impact on virus replication [35]. Vesicles labelled with autophagy marker LC3 are, however, produced during coronavirus infection suggesting that the virus activates autophagy. Autophagy may be activated by the nsp6 proteins of cornaviruses, or in the case of the arteriviruses, the equivalent nsp5\u20137 protein. The nsp6 (nsp5\u20137) proteins locate to the ER where they generate small vesicles enriched in phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate and early autophagy marker Atg5 [36\u2022\u2022]. These vesicles closely resemble cellular organelles called omegasomes that are formed from the ER during the initial stages of autophagy [37], and mature into autophagosomes labelled with autophagy marker Atg8/LC3. Autophagy is activated during cornavirus infection but this does not mean that all the DMVs generated in the cytoplasm are autophagosomes. Most of the DMVs are smaller than autophagosomes and may be formed from invaginations into the ER (Figure 1). Vesicles formed from the ER during coronavirus infection can also recruit a non-lipidated autophagy marker LC3 (LC3I) by a pathway, that is, paradoxically, independent of autophagy, and linked to the export of ER chaperones from the ER to endosomes [38\u2022\u2022]. Autophagosomes may not therefore play a direct role in the formation of virus-induced DMVs, but may represent a defence against infection.",

Translocation of LC3 to vesicles can be induced by expression of PV 2BC alone, but formation of DMVs resembling autophagosomes requires coexpression of 2BC with 3A [16, 39]. As with the coronaviruses, the picornavirus DMVs are approximately one third the diameter of cellular autophagosomes making it difficult to determine if assembly of the replicase complex results in the formation of DMVs directly, or if the DMVs represent modified autophagosomes.",

            "text": "Virus assembly and replication can also occur in virus factories close to the microtubule organising centre (MTOC) [40]. These inclusions lack cellular membranes and resemble inclusions called aggresomes that form at the MTOC in response to protein aggregation. Aggresome inclusions such as Lewy and Mallory bodies are a pathological hallmark of protein misfolding diseases, and protect cells from the damage associated with protein aggregation. Aggresomes and factories share many features in common including recruitment of mitochondria, cellular chaperones and confinement within cages of rearranged vimentin filaments (reviewed in [40, 42, 43]). Many viruses are delivered to the MTOC after entering cells, and in common with protein aggregates, this involves recognition by the microtubule motor protein, dynein. It is possible that viruses may appear foreign or misfolded to cells and stimulate an aggresome response. For the NCLDV this may be beneficial and provide a site for replication, for other viruses it may lead to confinement at the MTOC and degradation. Delivery of incoming African swine fever virus (ASFV) to the MTOC is important for the initiation of replication [41] and replication of both the ASFV and the iridovirus frog virus 3 appears to require rearrangement of vimentin [44, 45]. Vimentin may provide a scaffold to prevent diffusion of viral components into the cytoplasm. DNA and RNA are spatially separated within vaccinia virus (VACV) and ASFV factories [46\u2022, 47] and individual factories appear to be distinct entities within the cell. Although virus factories recruit many host-cell proteins to facilitate their replication, factories also represent effector sites for antiviral activity as VACV and ASFV replication sites are targeted by stress granule components and Mx proteins respectively [48, 49].",

            "text": "A number of clear similarities between the membrane rearrangements generated by the positive strand RNA viruses are beginning to emerge [1, 2] and these are shared between animal and plant viruses. Spherules and DMVs differ morphologically but may be formed by similar mechanisms involving ordered assembly of replicase proteins on membrane-bound organelles leading to membrane invagination (Figure 1). DMVs may be modified spherules where close apposition of ER-derived membranes follows initial invagination into the ER lumen. For cornaviruses, and possibly picornaviruses, this may result in loss of the pore connecting the spherule to the cytosol and conversion of the spherule into a site for storage of viral RNA to suppress innate immune responses to double-stranded RNA. The site of spherule formation differs between viruses (Figure 2\n) and is determined by membrane targeting sequences in the nonstructural proteins that recruit the RdRp. This has been demonstrated by the work of Miller et al. who could retarget FHV replication complexes from the mitochondria to the ER in yeast [50]. Recent work has shown that recruitment of RdRp may also involve modification of membrane lipids by Arf1-dependent recruitment of PI4KIII\u03b2 to membranes to generate PI4-P. This mechanism is shared between the enteroviruses of the picornavirus supergroup and the flavivirus HCV [25\u2022\u2022, 31\u2022]. The membrane vesicles generated by picornaviruses are most heterogeneous and varied between subgroups and may be derived from membrane compartments that fragment during infection, rather than be formed for virus replication. It is uncertain which membranes house the virus replicase and replication may occur on the cytoplasmic face of the ER rather than in vesicles [5]. Parallels between plant and animal picornaviruses are therefore difficult to define. The large DNA viruses of animals such as poxviruses and other members of the NCLDV generate perinuclear inclusions called virus factories that assemble at the MTOC and are maintained by dynein microtubule motor proteins. Replication complexes generated in plants often move through cells onboard microtubule motor proteins (Figure 2), but perinuclear inclusions are not found for plant viruses. As pointed out in the accompanying review by Jeanmarie Verchot, plants lack a MTOC to concentrate motor cargoes, and replication sites are therefore dispersed throughout the cell.",
