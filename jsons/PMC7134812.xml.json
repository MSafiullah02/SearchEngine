            "text": "Diarrhea is an important disease in neonatal llamas (Lama glama) and alpacas (Lama pacos). One study found that diarrhea was the most common cause of morbidity in the pre-weaning period, affecting some 23% of crias (Sharpe et al., unpublished data, 2000). This study monitored 250 crias on four farms over a 5-year period. Commercialization of alpaca breeding in the North America, Australia and Europe, for fiber production has led to increased stocking densities inevitably exposing young stock to higher concentrations of potential pathogens. Nutritional factors, such as overfeeding of bottle-fed orphans, may play a role but infectious pathogens are an increasingly important factor in neonatal diarrhea. A knowledge of the types of agents involved and at what age these infectious agents are likely to cause disease is important in deciding which diagnostic tests to perform and in initiating treatment. Additionally, the clinician must realize that failure to reach a diagnosis and treat the cause of diarrhea effectively will often lead to chronic diarrhea which may ultimately result in chronic renal failure. Failure to receive sufficient immunoglobulins from colostrum during the first 12 h of life predisposes the neonate to bacterial, viral and protozoal agents but each tends to have a characteristic clinical presentation and this may help guide the clinician with regard to therapeutic options. This review of the current literature regarding diarrhea in camelid neonates will include clinical experience of neonatal diarrhoea seen at The Ohio State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital between 1999 and 2004.",

Coccidiosis is typically associated with overcrowding and poor hygiene. The pathogenesis and severity of the clinical signs observed may be associated with the number of coccidia ingested. Re-infections from a contaminated environment can cause an excessive coccidia burden that may be fatal (Fowler, 1998). Following ingestion of sporulated oocysts, motile stages called sporozoites are released which penetrate epithelial cells in the small intestine. The sporozoites then undergo both sexual and asexual reproductive stages producing oocysts which are shed in the feces. The oocysts cause direct damage to the epithelial mucosa of the small intestine resulting in enteritis and diarrhea. Tenesmus may be observed. Diarrhea may be hemorrhagic and contain shreds of sloughed mucosa. As a result, nutrient malabsorption and subsequent poor growth ensue. Cheney and Allen (1989) report that since the lesions are primarily in the small intestine, fresh blood is rarely seen in affected llamas.",

All five species have been detected in fecal samples from camelids in the USA (Fowler, 1998). A distinguishing feature of the E. macusaniensis oocyst is that it is much larger than the other four species, measuring 81\u2013107 \u03bcm in length, and has a very thick wall (Guerrero et al., 1971). In contrast, the other four species measure 17\u201340 \u03bcm in length and have a thin-walled oocyst (Guerrero, 1967).",

The prepatent periods for E. alpacae and E. punoensis were established from experimental data using fecal samples from four llamas (Foreyt and Lagerquist, 1992). The authors have seen clinical coccidiosis in alpacas as early as 21 days of age.

Eight of these cases had been observed with pre-mortem diarrhea, four others had died suddenly. At necropsy, all of the carcasses were observed to be thin and dehydrated. Gross examination revealed gas-distended intestines with reddened intestinal mucosa throughout the small intestine and the mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged. Histopathologically, there was partial ulceration and moderate necrosis of the small intestinal mucosa with shortened intestinal villi. Throughout the mucosa there were large numbers of sexual and asexual stages of a coccidian that was thought to be E. macusaniensis. These were causing marked disruption of the epithelial crypt glands. Cebra et al. (2003) isolated Eimeria spp. 6 of 45 (13%) unweaned llama or alpaca crias with diarrhea. The six crias were between 21 and 60 days old. The peak times for diarrhea case submissions corresponded with the wetter months of Fall and Winter and at these times, coccidia were isolated more frequently. A case of coccidiosis and leptospirosis was reported in a 3-month-old guanaco (Hodgin et al., 1984). In this particular case, the cria died without pre- or post-mortem evidence of diarrhea and lesions of subacute enteritis with associated coccidian reproductive stages were confined to a relatively small portion (60 cm) of jejunum. The coccidiosis was not thought to have contributed to the death of this cria. Costarella and Anderson (1999) reported a case of ileocecocolic intussusception in a 1-month-old llama cria. A fecal examination had revealed many coccidial oocysts but there had been no signs of diarrhea and a causal relationship was considered but could not be established.",

In two of the studies, animals less than 1-year-old had the highest prevalence of oocyst shedding (Jarvinen, 1999; Rickard and Bishop, 1988). Information on age of animals was not available in the study by Schrey et al. (1991). Method of fecal examination can affect the yield of oocysts detected (Jarvinen, 1999). Flotation solutions with a specific gravity of \u22641.20 (i.e. saturated sodium chloride which is 1.20) may fail to allow detection of E. macusaniensis oocysts which are larger and heavier. In comparison, a sugar solution with specific gravity of 1.28\u20131.30 (used at a 1:10 dilution for oocyst detection by centrifugal flotation) gave more reliable results, especially when low concentrations of oocysts were present.",

Amprolium inhibits differentiation of merozoites by acting on first generation schizonts in the small intestine (Bennett et al., 2001).

Since outbreaks of coccidiosis are common in the wetter months, prophylactic drug regimes should be used during these times of year. Consideration should be given to application of preventative measures before and during stressful events such as weaning, shearing or herd movements. Amprolium may be used prophylactically and is added to water at 5 mg/kg body weight daily over a 21-day period. Correct dosage of amprolium is important since overdosing causes thiamine deficiency and can produce clinical polioencephalomalacia. Alternatively, decoquinate may be used more safely added into feed at 0.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days.

Villous atrophy and sloughing of enterocytes may occur due to hypovolemia, ischemia and circulatory problems in the host\u2014rather than being a specific effect of the bacterial toxins themselves. If E. coli infection occurs concurrently with rotavirus or coronavirus infection, then the villous atrophy may be extensive and severe. Different combinations of virulence factors (fimbriae and enterotoxins) determine the classification of ETEC strains, the majority of which are plasmid-encoded. Commonly-known fimbriae are K88, K99 and F41 while STa is the enterotoxin found in cattle isolates. It is not known specifically which virulence factors might be produced by ETEC affecting camelid species although the pathogenesis of the disease is presumed to be the same.",

Cryptosporidium oocysts are extremely resistant to decay in the environment and to most disinfectants. As few as 10 oocysts can induce disease in susceptible individuals while clinically affected calves can shed greater than 1010 oocysts during infections forming a significant source of infection for other animals (Tzipori and Ward, 2002). Additionally, asymptomatic adult cattle are thought to be a major source of environmental contamination. The exact mechanism by which Cryptosporidium attaches and invades enterocytes is poorly understood at the present time. However, it is known that following attachment, Cryptosporidium forms a parasitophorous vacuole within the host cell (intracellular but extracytoplasmic) bounded by a parasitophorous vacuolar membrane derived from the host cell membrane. This protects the organism from the hostile environment of the gut lumen as well as the host cell's defenses. An additional \u201cfeeder organelle membrane\u201d in Cryptosporidium, as opposed to other coccidian parasites, is thought to be primarily responsible for nutrient uptake from the host cell. Inclusion of Cryptosporidium within enterocytes reduces gastrointestinal absorption in affected individuals due to loss of epithelium, villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance (malabsorptive diarrhea). Maldigestion also occurs as a result of the loss of membrane-bound digestive enzymes such that weight loss and emaciation in neonates is typical. Autoinfection can occur. The authors have diagnosed renal failure in multiple crias with cryptosporidiosis. The mechanism of kidney damage is presumed to be prolonged states of subclinical dehydration leading to reduced renal perfusion and tubular necrosis.",

Lasalocid (0.45 mg/kg q24 for 3 days) has been used by the authors in llamas and alpacas with some success. However, this drug must be dosed carefully to avoid ionophore toxicosis and its efficacy needs further invesitigation. Paromomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that has been used in human cases but studies appear to disagree regarding its efficacy (Tzipori and Ward, 2002). One study showed that it was no more effective than placebo for treating cryptosporidiosis in patients with advanced HIV infection (Hewitt et al., 2000). Several studies have been performed in animals but the results are inconsistent. In one trial, prophylactic paromomycin administration did not reduce the incidence of disease in treated calves but appeared to increase the pre-patent period (Grinberg et al., 2002). A field trial conducted in infected lambs showed significant reduction in excretion of oocysts in lambs treated with paromomycin (100 or 200 mg/kg once daily for 3 consecutive days) as well as a reduction in clinical symptoms (Viu et al., 2000). Other drugs have been tested in humans including azithromycin, sometimes in combination with paromomycin, and nitazoxanide. In Europe, halofuginone has been used with success for prevention of cryptosporidiosis (Hunt, 1999).",

In crias aged less than 7 days, diarrhea is most likely to be caused either by nutritional factors in bottle-fed neonates or by gram negative infections, especially when colostrum ingestion has been inadequate. In the latter situation, the diarrhea is likely to be accompanied by septicemia and affected crias will be quite ill. Viral diarrhea rarely affects crias younger than 7 days and in the US is mostly due to coronavirus. Cryptosporidium and giardia also affect crias aged 7 days or older and these pathogens tend to be more of a problem on large farms. However, the common practice of moving females with their crias during the neonatal period for breeding purposes with inadequate quarantine provision may result in infections on small units also. In addition, giardia may be a problem on farms using surface ponds as their water supply. Coccidiosis does not seem to occur in crias younger than 3 weeks but must be addressed as a herd issue when it is recognized. Diarrhea caused by gastrointestinal parasites is unlikely in crias younger than 2 months. It is important to recognize that multiple pathogen disease occurs, especially with cryptosporidium and this may affect treatment options and rate of recovery. Diagnostic tests are available for all of these pathogens and appropriate testing will aid the clinician in directing treatment for the individual and in helping to control the spread of disease among susceptible animals in the herd.",
