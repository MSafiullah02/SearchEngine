The public health infrastructure must be prepared to prevent illness and injury that would result from a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear incident. As with emerging infectious diseases, the early detection and control of biological and chemical attacks depends upon a strong and flexible public health system at the local, state, federal, and international levels.

Part of the NRF addresses the 15 emergency support functions (ESF) under which many local, state, and federal governments organize their resources and capabilities. ESF #8 is Public Health and Medical Services, which covers most of the functions of federal, state, and local health departments as well as other healthcare partners [U. S.

In an effort to create a united response among agencies and organizations, local health departments follow the National Incident Management System (NIMS).

In emergency preparedness, PODs, or mass prophylaxis clinics, are the primary strategy used by local health departments to distribute medical countermeasures, such as medications (vaccine or antibiotics), to the public. PODs are also used in the everyday function of local health departments such as annual flu or routine immunization clinics. They vary in size, number, and location depending upon the jurisdiction, disease, and other factors. The annual TAR guidance requests localities to collect some baseline data which includes hourly estimated throughput, numbers of PODs, types of PODs, and levels of staffing. PODs are aimed at prophylaxis (prevention of illness), rather than at treatment (medical efforts to treat symptomatic individuals) (IOM 2008) .",

These could include traditional \"walk-up\" clinics where persons arrive one by one at multiple venues or \"drive-through\" clinics where cars drive up to receive medication. These clinics were popular during the H1N1 pandemic and often are used for annual flu or traditional vaccination clinics. The second design is a decentralized POD model, where the local health department and its partners would deliver directly to the public; this concept is referred to as the \"push model\" (Ablah et al. 2010) . For example, if a target population were school children, as during annual flu season, then PODs in the schools might be the fastest method to dispense the vaccine.

BioWatch and infectious disease surveillance through the public health and healthcare systems are complementary. However, BioWatch has the potential to provide a timelier alert than the public health systems due to the quick turnaround time in reporting results. Also, the testing is focused on only select biological agents, unlike the wide range of infectious agents tested in the public health systems (Shea and Lister 2003) .",

Many of these planning considerations and identification of resources can be done pre-event, while others may occur during real time after the incident begins. Throughout step 2, it is necessary to assess funding at each stage of the process. For example, during an annual influenza vaccination campaign, funding may be limited. To have the largest community impact, planners may decide to use limited resources for PODs at elementary schools to target young children, an at-risk population that can spread disease quickly within the community, along with a few selected small public PODs targeting other at-risk populations.

Considerable pre-event planning must be devoted to recruiting, training, and maintaining sufficient numbers of POD staff and volunteers to open and operate the PODs. Many local health departments will depend upon government employees, Medical Reserve Corps members, and other medical and nonmedical volunteers to serve as staff in PODs. As described above, planning models can be used to determine the number of direct service staff (i.e., those who provide the medication to the resident) to assure maximum capacity and to prevent unnecessary bottlenecks. The non-service-related staff (i.e., those who oversee the POD operations, assist with line direction, and serve as replacements) also need to be determined by planners. The NIMS or Incident Command System (ICS) provides a structure to assure a clear chain of command, communication, and supervision and includes the functional areas of finance, logistics, operations, and planning. ICS is the on-site structure used at the scene of an event (U.S. DHS, FEMA 2011c) . Because the public health functions during an emergency are much more complex than they are during typical public health activities and require collaborating with many different agencies and disciplines, having a common structure like the ICS is key to the function of the response, which include PODs (Landesman 2001) . POD plans should include detailed ICS organizational staffing charts for use in emergencies, and it may be necessary to include other agencies, such as law enforcement, to demonstrate a unified response. For annual flu vaccination PODs and other nonemergency PODs, a modified version of these organizational charts can be used. Nonemergency POD operations provide an ample opportunity to practice using the ICS structure and NIMS. A sample organization chart for a small venue (300-600 clients) flu vaccination POD is seen in Fig. 12.4 ; a large venue (5,000-7,000 clients) flu vaccination POD is seen in Fig. 12 .5.",

It is important to communicate clear and concise messages to the public about who is at risk (i.e., target populations) and what preventive measures can be taken (i.e., flu vaccinations). Public information messages should be developed to inform the public that symptomatic persons should not go to a POD to receive prophylactic medication but to seek medical treatment at hospitals or other facilities or from their private physicians. During annual flu vaccine campaigns, the federal government provides public service announcements to encourage the public to get vaccinated; state and local efforts focus more on providing information on when and where to receive the vaccination (Rambhia et al. 2010 ).",

Results found that 97% of the study respondents returned their MedKits upon completion of the study; 75% of the respondents reported that having the MedKit in their home increased their awareness to prepare for a public health emergency and the majority, 94% or more of each cohort, acknowledged that they would like to have a MedKit in their homes (U.S. DHHS, CDC 2007) .

The Montgomery County, Maryland Advanced Practice Center, and the University of Maryland have studied this possibility using personal digital assistants (PDAs), Blackberry \u00ae , and iPhone \u00ae devices.

The PDA version was field tested in 2009 during an actual drive-through clinic in Tarrant County, TX, for a hepatitis A vaccine. The results found that screeners using the PDA screening were two times faster than those using the traditional paper screening (Tarrant County, Texas Advanced Practice Center 2009). More information about this project can be found at http://www.isr.umd.edu/Labs/CIM/projects/clinic/. The Bay Area Mass Prophylaxis Working Group (BAMPWG) in California has created an online screening form for anthrax prophylaxis based on the concept that residents can easily prescreen themselves for medications prior to arrival at a POD (see http://www.bayareadisastermeds.org/). The residents answer a limited number of questions for up to 20 people then receive a printout of which resident should receive which drug, along with dosing instructions, if applicable. The site, pretested with 8,000 people per minute, was created in web-based software that can be modified easily by the BAMPWG. Some of the benefits in using an online screening form are that residents can go directly through an \"express\" route at the POD and that throughput increases at the POD by reducing the number of people who need to go to screening (Relucio and Pine 2010) .",
