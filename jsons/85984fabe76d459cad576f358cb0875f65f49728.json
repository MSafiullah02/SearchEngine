We consider an epidemic model that is network based and non-Markovian, containing classic Kermack-McKendrick, pairwise, message passing, and spatial models as special cases. For this model, we prove a monotonic relationship between the variability of the infectious period (with fixed mean) and the probability that the infection will reach any given subset of the population by any given time. For certain families of distributions, this result implies that epidemic severity is decreasing with respect to the variance of the infectious period. The striking importance of this relationship is demonstrated numerically. We then prove, with a fixed basic reproductive ratio (R 0 ), a monotonic relationship between the variability of the posterior transmission probability (which is a function of the infectious period) and the probability that the infection will reach any given subset of the population by any given time. Thus again, even when R 0 is fixed, variability of the infectious period tends to dampen the epidemic. Numerical results illustrate this but indicate the relationship is weaker. We then show how our results apply to message passing, pairwise, and Kermack-McKendrick epidemic models, even when they are not exactly consistent with the stochastic dynamics. For Poissonian contact processes, and arbitrarily distributed infectious periods, we demonstrate how systems of delay differential equations and ordinary differential equations can provide upper and lower bounds, respectively, for the probability that any given individual has been infected by any given time.",

However, under the same assumptions, other important quantifiers such as the probability of a major outbreak, the final size, and the initial growth rate can depend on the variability of the infectious period, higher variability tending to decrease these quantities [1, 2] . When accounting for the more realistic scenario where individuals can only make direct contacts to their neighbor in a contact network [3] , R 0 typically depends on the variability of the infectious period and, even when R 0 is held fixed, the probability that any given individual will eventually get infected is still dependent on the variability of the infectious period [4] .

In choosing the parameter for this distribution, the modeler may try to replicate the estimated average infectious period or the estimated value for R 0 . In any case, the exponential distribution is typically not very realistic for this variable. For example, it has been suggested that gamma, Weibull, and degenerate (nonrandom) distributions may be more realistic for diseases such as smallpox, ebola, and measles [5] [6] [7] [8] . Thus, investigating the effect of the infectious period distribution is important for obtaining a qualitative understanding of the ability of different diseases to propagate, and of the effects of intervention strategies which may modify this distribution. It is also important for informing parameter choices in epidemic models.",

It was shown that, under stronger assumptions than here, the long-term probabilities lim t\u2192\u221e P (A,t) are not less in the model with the nonrandom infectious period. To relate more directly to this result, we define (following [17] and [18] ) the \"transmissibility\" to be the posterior probability that an infected individual, with a given infectious period, will make a contact to a given neighbor before recovering. Thus, the transmissibility is a random variable since it is a function of the infectious period, and its expected value is the transmission probability. We show that by changing the infectious period distribution such that the transmissibility is decreased in convex order, which we shall argue keeps R 0 constant, we can only increase P (A,t).

Let \u03bd i \u2208 [0,\u221e] denote the time period that i spends in the exposed state; \u03bc i \u2208 [0,\u221e) is i's infectious period, i.e., the time period that i spends in the infectious state; \u03c9 ji \u2208 [0,\u221e] is the time elapsing between i first entering the infectious state and it making a sufficient (for transmission) contact to j (note that the sufficient contact is not infectious, i.e., cannot cause infection, if it occurs after i's infectious period has terminated); W i out is some variable on which all of the sufficient contact times \u03c9 ji (j \u2208 N i ) may depend, e.g., a quantifier of i's infectiousness arising from sources other than the length of its infectious period (similar to I i in [17] ); W i in is some variable on which all of the sufficient contact times \u03c9 ij (j \u2208 N i ) may depend, e.g., a quantifier of i's susceptibility (similar to S i in [17] ). For t \u2208 [0,\u221e), i makes an infectious contact to j at time t if and only if (i) i enters the infectious state at some time s t, (ii) \u03c9 ji = t \u2212 s, and (iii) \u03c9 ji \u03bc i . Susceptible individuals enter the exposed state as soon as they receive an infectious contact, exposed individuals immediately enter the infectious state when their exposed period terminates, and infectious individuals immediately enter the recovered state when their infectious period terminates. Individuals may be in any state at t = 0 except the exposed state, and we may interpret being in the recovered state at t = 0 as being vaccinated.",

III (see Theorem 1 in the Appendix). Using the graphical sufficient condition for the convex order, and keeping R 0 constant by keeping the expected values of the Z i constant, we have that P (A,t) is maximized when the Z i are nonrandom. This is the case when the infectious periods are nonrandom. So, whether the infectious periods are altered such that the means are held constant, or such that R 0 is held constant (with the slightly different sets of assumptions), P (A,t) is maximized when the infectious periods are nonrandom. On the other hand, P (A,t) is minimized when the Z i can only be equal to either zero or one. This is the case when the infectious periods can only be zero or infinite. Thus, as with the infectious periods themselves, there is a clear tendency for decreasing the variances of the transmissibility variables to increase P (A,t).",

Importantly, if the \u03c9 variables are mutually independent or positively correlated and the states of individuals at t = 0 are mutually independent, then a lower bound on S (i) mes (t) is also a lower bound on the probability that i is susceptible at time t, and an upper bound on R (i) mes (t) is also an upper bound on the probability that i is recovered/vaccinated at time t.

For a given epidemic model, this also suggests the strategy of computing the transmission probability, or R 0 , first and then using this to inform a new choice for the infectious period distribution which will ease numerical solution or mathematical analysis.

Thus, if condition (i) or (ii) holds, then condition (a) or (b) holds for Theorem 1 and we have that P (A,t) is greater, or the same, if \u03bc d = \u03bc 2 than if \u03bc d = \u03bc 1 , for all n.",

Therefore if Z * 1 st Z * 2 or Z * 1 cx Z * 2 then Z 1 (n) st Z 2 (n) or Z 1 (n) dcx Z 2 (n), where Z 1 (n) = \u03bc 1 0 f \u03c9(n) (\u03c4 )d\u03c4 and Z 2 (n) = \u03bc 2 0 f \u03c9(n) (\u03c4 )d\u03c4 . This follows since any decreasing function of Z(n) can be expressed as a decreasing function of Z * [since Z(n) is an increasing function of Z * ], and any decreasing convex function of Z(n) can be expressed as a convex function of Z * [since Z(n) is a concave function of Z * ]. Thus, if condition (iii) or (iv) holds, then condition (c) or (d) holds for Theorem 1 and we have that P (A,t) is greater, or the same, if \u03bc d = \u03bc 2 than if \u03bc d = \u03bc 1 , for all n. The probability that individual i \u2208 V is susceptible at time t, which by symmetry is the same for all i \u2208 V, is equal to [1 \u2212 P ({i},t)] minus the probability that the individual is initially recovered/vaccinated. Thus, if at least one of the conditions holds then, by Theorem 1, the probability that an arbitrary individual is susceptible at time t 0 is greater (or the same) if \u03bc d = \u03bc 1 than if \u03bc d = \u03bc 2 , for every model in the sequence, i.e., for all n. Now, using Theorem 6 in [15] , which tells us that as n \u2192 \u221e the probability that an arbitrary individual is susceptible at time t converges to S(t) given by the Kermack-McKendrick model (12)- (14) [since here the message passing system is exact [15] and nf \u03c9(n) (\u03c4 ) \u2192 h(\u03c4 ), satisfying condition (i) of that theorem], we have S 1 (t) S 2 (t) for all t > 0.",
