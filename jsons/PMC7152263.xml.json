There have been many studies of pulmonary physiology in patients with endocrine disorders, some of which have revealed clinically significant functional abnormalities. In other studies, however, physiologic abnormalities have not translated into clinical dysfunction, but they have helped add to our understanding of lung parenchymal growth and development, response to extrathoracic influences, and perhaps even aging. This chapter reviews the effects of various endocrine abnormalities on the pulmonary system.",

In addition to genetic predisposition, obesity, and other factors such as diet and inflammatory mediators, active cigarette smoking is associated with the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.2, 3, 4 The reason for this association has yet to be elucidated, although nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are expressed on pancreatic islet cells5 and nicotine exposure has been associated with beta cell dysfunction and increased beta cell apoptosis.6 Although less dramatic, there has also been an increase in the incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus in the United States and worldwide.7, 8 Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells in genetically susceptible patients, most likely triggered by environmental agents. The genetic basis of autoimmune type 1 diabetes has now been largely determined, and there are some shared genetic associations with known atopy-related traits.9\n",

Young persons with asthma were more likely to have poorer glycemic control and higher body mass index (BMI) values, particularly in the group with type 1 diabetes.

The pattern was restrictive with a mild decrease in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide and was irrespective of BMI, smoking, diabetes duration, and HbA1c levels. In subanalyses, the association seemed to be more pronounced in type 2 diabetes than in type 1 diabetes. These mild functional abnormalities\u2014generally well within 80% of the reference value16\u2014have been ascribed to premature aging of the lungs in a fashion similar to nonenzymatic protein glycosylation and microangiopathic changes that develop in many affected organs in patients with diabetes.17 In summary, diabetes mellitus (in the absence of cystic fibrosis) may cause a mild decline in pulmonary function measurements, but does not appear to cause clinically significant pulmonary impairment, and routine pulmonary function testing in patients with diabetes is not warranted.",

These metabolic changes were more common in older men with heavy smoking habits before quitting; the increased risk for diabetes peaked within 3 years after quitting. Despite weight gain with smoking cessation, overall cardiovascular events decreased in patients who quit smoking.29 In summary, both active smoking and the post-cessation period are associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes.

Angioinvasion is a hallmark of infections with mucormycosis. These ubiquitous saprophytic fungi are found in soil and decaying vegetation; infection is caused by inhalation of spores, hence the predilection for paranasal sinus and lung disease. Infection typically develops during or after an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis, perhaps because the fungi have an enzyme, ketone reductase, which favors growth in an acidic, hyperglycemic environment. Most patients have some underlying predisposition, of which diabetes mellitus is the most significant.46 Five infectious manifestations have been described: rhinocerebral, pulmonary, disseminated, cutaneous, and gastrointestinal. Rhinocerebral infection is the most common form, especially in patients with diabetes. Presentation includes sudden periorbital or paranasal swelling and pain, bloody nasal discharge, and black necrotic nasal mucosa. Computed tomography (CT) findings are mostly nonspecific, but can include an air crescent sign (rim of air between necrotic lung and surrounding parenchyma) as well as the halo sign (rim of surrounding ground-glass opacities around dense consolidation).47 Treatment requires control of the diabetes, antifungal therapy, and often aggressive surgical debridement. Mortality remains high, especially in patients with intracranial involvement.48\n",

For specimens obtained at bronchoscopy, histopathologic examination appears to be more sensitive than fungal cultures.

Diabetes appears to be a risk factor for Legionella pneumonia63 and is associated with high mortality in infected persons.64 Pharyngeal dysfunction and diabetic gastroparesis in persons with diabetes may predispose them to aspiration pneumonia.65 Diabetes is a risk factor for chronic oral infections of caries and periodontitis, which also may contribute to the increased risk for aspiration pneumonia.66 There is an increased incidence of bacterial pneumonia and associated mortality in patients with diabetes during seasonal influenza outbreaks.67 Consistent with the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, influenza vaccination is recommended for patients with diabetes who are older than 6 months of age.68 Regarding preventive practices in patients with known diabetes, approximately 60% have obtained annual influenza vaccines, whereas just 49% have met goals of pneumococcal vaccination.69 As for other pathogens, preexisting diabetes has been associated with a higher mortality in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome.70\n",

Treatment of the hyperthyroidism is important to relieve the additional burden of cardiovascular stress on the pulmonary vascular system.97 Rarely, mothers with hyperthyroidism from Graves disease deliver infants with hyperthyroidism via placental passage of maternal thyrotropin receptor-stimulating antibodies. In addition to a variety of infant metabolic and developmental problems, neonatal Graves disease has been associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns.99 Interestingly, there may also be an increased prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension.100\n",

A reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide can be seen in some hypothyroid, nonobese patients with normal lung volumes and arterial blood gases that improve to near-normal after replacement therapy.105 Hypothyroidism is associated with overall respiratory muscle weakness as measured by maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures, and the degree of impairment is linearly related to the degree of pretreatment hypothyroidism.106 Diaphragmatic muscle weakness in both obese and nonobese hypothyroid patients may range from mild impairment, which limits exercise tolerance, to severe dysfunction, with marked resting dyspnea and chronic hypercarbia.104 Thyroid replacement therapy can improve respiratory muscle strength. Some nonobese and obese hypothyroid patients have a markedly blunted ventilatory response to hypoxia and hypercapnia,105, 107 which improves often within weeks of initiation of thyroid hormone replacement. This improvement is not associated with changes in spirometric function or maximal voluntary ventilation, thus suggesting a central cause for the abnormal ventilatory response.

Metastatic calcification is the deposition of calcium salts in previously normal tissue; in contrast, dystrophic calcification is the calcification of diseased or abnormal tissue, as in granulomatous processes. Despite dietary phosphate restriction, administration of phosphate binders, and hemodialysis, patients with renal failure are at risk for metastatic calcification, especially when the calcium-phosphorus concentration product increases above 70 mg2/dL2. Calcium salts tend to precipitate in alkaline conditions. Indeed, metastatic calcification has a predilection for the apical portions of the lungs (Fig. 95-4\n), the stomach, and the kidneys\u2014all tissues with relative alkalinity, because of either carbon dioxide removal or hydrogen ion excretion. Due to the higher ventilation-perfusion ratio and lower carbon dioxide concentration at the lung apex, it is estimated that the pH at the apex is 7.5 compared to a pH of 7.3 at the base.123, 124 Other common sites of deposition include soft tissues and the skin. Pulmonary metastatic calcific nodules may deposit predominantly in the alveolar septa and are associated with varying degrees of fibrosis and septal thickening. This phenomenon appears to be common; from 60% to 80% of dialysis patients on long-term therapy have autopsy or scintigraphic evidence of pulmonary metastatic calcification.125\n",

Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Patients with diabetes should receive pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations and, because of an increased risk for progression to active tuberculosis, should receive treatment for latent tuberculosis infection if they have a tuberculin skin test greater than 10 mm or a positive interferon-gamma release assay.\u25aaThyroid enlargement may cause upper airway compression. Patients with hyperthyroidism may have dyspnea worsened by decreases in vital capacity and respiratory muscle strength. More commonly, patients with hypothyroidism suffer from dyspnea, alveolar hypoventilation, pleural effusion, and, sometimes, respiratory failure.\u25aaSecondary hyperparathyroidism from end-stage renal disease often causes diffuse metastatic pulmonary calcification, which frequently is asymptomatic.\u25aaEndogenous Cushing syndrome predisposes to a variety of opportunistic infections, whereas acromegaly from excess growth hormone is associated with a high prevalence of sleep apnea, and may lead to upper airway structural disorders.\n\n",
