The spectrum of these diseases often differs from those observed in macaque species, and veterinarians caring for common marmosets need to be aware of these unique susceptibilities. In formulating differential diagnoses for sick or diseased animals, it should be recognized that diseases once common in imported animals in the 1960s and 1970s are now rare. It is also important to recognize that housing and sanitation conditions can influence exposure to potentially pathogenic bacteria. In a zoological setting where mixed- or free-ranging exhibits are utilized, animals may be exposed to many more potential pathogens, than would be the case in animals raised in a barrier facility.",

Typical granulomas consisting of a central region of necrosis surrounded by a cuff of epithelioid macrophages admixed with neutrophils and an outer layer of lymphocytes and histiocytes were observed. Multinucleated giant cells and regions of mineralization characteristic of more chronic infections were not observed. Occasional granulomas appeared cavitated and contained semiliquid caseum.

Some caution is advised in the interpretation of these results as both false-positive and -negative results are possible. As noted above, detection of environmental NTM sequences does not equate with disease causation and could potentially mask an underlying MTC infection. Moreover, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the various PCR assays have not been rigorously assessed in fluid and tissue samples obtained from clinically affected marmosets. The relative sensitivity of PCR compared with culture in this setting is not defined.",

Animals should be regularly examined on a quarterly basis; blood obtained for biobanking and 0.05 mL of old mammalian tuberculin should be administered with a 26-gauge needle in the upper eyelid. Purified protein derivative (PPD) used in the human TST is not appropriate. The animals are then visually examined at 24, 48, and 72 h for evidence of redness of swelling. The TST is scored as follows: grade 1, slight bruising of the eyelid; grade 2, erythema of the palpebrum without swelling; grade 3, variable degree of erythema, with minimal swelling; grade 4, obvious swelling, with drooping of the eyelid and erythema; and grade 5, marked swelling and/or necrosis of the eyelid [26]. A grade 3 reaction is considered equivocal, and grades 4 and 5 are considered positive. Due to the risk to colony and human health, in most cases a grade 4 or 5 will result in the euthanasia of the animal. A complete necropsy should be performed with collection of tissue for histopathology, mycobacterial culture, and PCR. While awaiting definitive diagnosis, contact animals should be placed under quarantine and the TST repeated once every 2 weeks until three negative tests are achieved in all remaining animals. Interpretation of equivocal or grade 3 reactions should be made with an assessment of the overall risk of tuberculosis in the individual animal and the colony as a whole. At a minimum, additional diagnostics such as blood work and radiographs should be completed, and the animal and its contacts should be retested by TST. If the risk is deemed high, because of clinical signs such as weight loss or potential recent contact with tuberculosis cases in other animals or humans, euthanasia and necropsy may be warranted.",

The QuantiFERON-TB test (manufactured by Cellestis Limited, Carnegie, Victoria, Australia) was approved in 2001 by the Food and Drug Administration as an aid for detecting latent M. tuberculosis infection. This in vitro diagnostic test measures a component of cell-mediated immune reactivity to M. tuberculosis. Quantification of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) released from sensitized lymphocytes is measured in whole blood incubated overnight with PPD from M. tuberculosis and control antigens [27], [28]. Individuals with signs of upper or lower respiratory tract infections should not work with animals until cleared to do so. Personal protective equipment should be required of all staff while working with nonhuman primates. While a standard face mask does not provide respiratory protection, it does help contain aerosols generated by the wearer when coughing or sneezing. Protection from infected individuals may be more difficult or impossible in zoological settings in which animals are free ranging and may come in contact with visitors. These animals may be at greater risk of contracting tuberculosis as indicated by recent surveys conducted in neotropical primates in Brazil [20], [21].",

Typical EPEC carry a gene encoding the bundle-forming pilus (bfp), which is responsible for initial attachment of the bacteria to enterocytes. The organisms possess a type 3 secretion system (T3SS), which allows the direct insertion of more than 25 bacterial proteins into the target cell's cytoplasm. Intimin is an outer membrane protein encoded by the eaeA gene and is required for full virulence of the organism. Intimin binds to the translocated intimin receptor (Tir), which has been introduced into the target cell membrane by the T3SS. Tir\u2013intimin interaction initiates full adherence of the organism to the target cell surface, and subsequent phosphorylation of intracytoplasmic Tir domains causes polymerization of actin. It is this effect on actin that results in effacement of the brush border and the formation of an attachment pedestal, both of which can be recognized ultrastructurally. The eventual induction of diarrhea correlates with these morphological changes in enterocytes and is caused by the destruction of the microvilli and tight junctions [39].",

These E. coli strains have been associated with urogenital tract infections, septicemia, and meningitis in humans [40], [41]. Their clinical relevance in marmosets requires further investigation. CNF-positive E. coli also have been isolated from macaques [42]. In a recent study, the prevalence of cytotoxins encoded by pks and cnf in E. coli cultured from rectal swabs of marmosets housed in three separate colonies was documented. Isolates of E. coli were identified and characterized biochemically. Specific PCR for pks and cnf gene amplification and phylogenetic group identification were performed on all E. coli strains. A total of 139 E. coli strains were isolated from 120 of the 138 marmosets (87%) in the three colonies. In Colony A, 31 strains of E. coli were isolated from 25 of the 31 animals; 55% of the animals had pks+ E. coli, and 52% had cnf+ E. coli. In Colony B, 33 strains of E. coli were isolated from 32 of the 33 animals, 6% of the animals had pks+ E. coli, and 9% had cnf+ E. coli. In Colony C, 75 strains of E. coli were isolated from 63 of the 74 animals, 43% of the animals had pks+ E. coli, and 35% had cnf+ E. coli. Both pks+ and cnf+ E. coli strains belonged mainly to phylogenetic group B2. Colibactin and CNF cytotoxic activities were confirmed using a HeLa cell cytotoxicity assay. The presence of pks+ or cnf+ E. coli did not correlate with health status. However, given the association of these cytotoxin-producing E. coli strains with clinical disease in humans, the colonization of marmosets with these cytotoxin-producing E. coli can potentially cause clinical and subclinical diseases that impact marmoset models [39a].",

Few clinical details are provided and cases were documented in marmosets recently imported from South America in the 1960s and 1970s. Enteritis induced by EPEC and Campylobacter spp. should be considered far more common [53]. Clinical disease is likely exacerbated from comorbidities, stress of capture, and shipment. Histologically, enterocolitis with congestion, hemorrhage, and edema was observed and could be accompanied by focal necrosis in the gastrointestinal tract, spleen, and liver. In human patients with noninvasive salmonellosis, symptoms generally resolve in 5\u20137 days with supportive therapy [54]. Systemic antibiotics are reserved for individuals with invasive disease (enteric fever). Diagnosis of invasive disease can be problematic and relies on clinical findings as well as blood cultures and isolation of the organism. As the natural history of salmonellosis is poorly described in neotropical primates, criteria for initiation of antimicrobial therapy have not been established.

Purpose-bred common marmosets from domestic sources have been reported to have a high incidence of spontaneous IBD and sporadic cholecystitis and cholangiohepatitis.

Helicobacter spp. were also isolated from two liver samples and one gallbladder sample. Helicobacter spp. were detected in 36% of the gallbladder samples by PCR, which may be related to the finding that about 10% of the marmosets had cholecystitis or biliary inflammation. Animals aged 6 years and older had higher Helicobacter-positive prevalence rates than animals younger than 5 years (39% by culture and 57% by PCR vs. 0% by culture and 27% by PCR). Helicobacter species were isolated from animals ingesting a high-fat diet, from primates treated with chemical compounds, and from animals without diarrhea [62].",

These changes included glomerular and interstitial nephritis, amyloidosis, increased extramedullary hematopoiesis, and metabolic bone disease. In addition, in the recent study, lesions of the hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal systems were recognized and characterized by prominent inflammatory changes in a relatively high percentage of animals [62]. In the liver, the inflammatory lesions consisted of lymphoid infiltrates in hepatic portal regions as well as mild-to-moderate infiltrates in the mucosa and submucosal tissues of large bile ducts and gallbladder. Occasional animals had mild-to-moderate cholangiohepatitis, and several marmosets had cholecystitis with transmural lymphocytic infiltration of the gallbladder. Lymphoid infiltrates increased in incidence and severity with age [62]. Enteric pathology consisted of a continuous spectrum of IBD changes ranging from relatively minimal focal to segmental lymphoid infiltrates in the lamina propria to severe lymphoid cell accumulations with effacement of the normal bowel architecture in both large and small intestines. Severe accumulations of chronic inflammatory cells found in the lamina propria were associated with changes in villous and crypt architecture, with intraepithelial inflammatory cell accumulations. It is not known what role, if any, H. jaachi plays in the development of these lesions [62] (Figure 16.8, Figure 16.9, Figure 16.10\n).",

Additional lesions were observed in the lung, liver, and skeletal muscle of common marmosets with experimentally induced SPFL. In these animals, the alveolar spaces in the lung were filled with erythrocytes and proteinaceous fluid in a multifocal to coalescing pattern. The alveolar septa were thickened by infiltrating macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. Multifocal myofiber necrosis with interstitial edema and hemorrhage was observed in the skeletal muscle. In the liver, multifocal hepatic necrosis with occasional Councilman bodies was evident. These changes were accompanied by mild interstitial edema, Kupffer cell activation, and foci of parenchymal hemorrhage. Hepatocellular dissociation which may be seen in other species with icteric leptospirosis was not a predominant finding.",
