Our results show that (i) power-law growth is observed in all countries; (ii) by using the distance correlation, the power-law curves between countries are statistically highly correlated, suggesting the universality of such curves around the world; and (iii) soft quarantine strategies are inefficient to flatten the growth curves. Furthermore, we present a model and strategies that allow the government to reach the flattening of the power-law curves. We found that besides the social distancing of individuals, of well known relevance, the strategy of identifying and isolating infected individuals in a large daily rate can help to flatten the power-laws. These are the essential strategies followed in the Republic of Korea. The high correlation between the power-law curves of different countries strongly indicates that the government containment measures can be applied with success around the whole world. These measures are scathing and to be applied as soon as possible.",

One of the most remarkable characteristics of COVID-19 is its high infectivity, resulting in a global pandemic. In this complex scenario, tasks such as protecting the people from the infection and the global economy are considered two major challenges. In order to improve our knowledge about COVID-19 and its behavior in different countries around the world, we exhaustively explore the real time-series of cumulative number of confirmed infected cases by COVID-19 in the last few months until March 27, 2020.

For 1 < R 0 < \u221e, this number increases exponentially. 2, 3 However, the nature is full of surprises, and there are plenty of cases for which the exponential behavior is substituted by power-law 4 and are related to branching processes with diverging reproductive number, 2 scale free networks, and small worlds. 5 It was already suggested in the literature that the COVID-19 growth might be a small world. 6 This is in agreement with recent results 7 suggesting that, for many countries around the world, the COVID-19 growth has the tendency to follow the power-law.",

This suggests that socioeconomic differences, local geography, differences in containment strategies, and heterogeneities essentially affect the value of the exponent \u00b5 but not the qualitative behavior. A model of coupled differential equations, which includes quarantine and isolation effects, was used by the authors to match real data. Power-law growths for China were also obtained in another study and a possible relation to fractal kinetics and graph theory is discussed. 9 In line with the above publications, the present work analyzes the time-series evolution of the COVID-19 for the following countries: Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Spain, and the United States of America (USA). In all cases, we observe a power-law increase for the positive detected individuals, where the exponent \u00b5 changes for different countries. In addition to the power-law behavior, we also computed the Distance Correlation (DC) 10 between pairs of countries. The DC is able to detect nonlinear correlations between data. 11, 12 We show that power-law data are highly correlated between all analyzed countries. This strongly suggest that government strategies to flatten the power-law growth, valid for one country, can be successfully applied to other countries and continents. Furthermore, a model of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) is proposed and some strategies to flatten the power-law curves are discussed using the numerical simulations.",

Results in Table I are presented in decreasing order of the exponent \u00b5; the USA [ Fig. 1(a) ] has by far the largest exponent and, therefore, became already the country with epidemic records. Even though Germany [ Fig. 1(b) ] reported a small number of deaths, it has the second large exponent, followed by Spain [ Fig. 1 In the case of China and Republic of Korea, the power-laws are more clear due to the number of available data. For these two countries, a flatten is observed after the power-law. The jump observed after 30 days in China data is due to a change in the counting procedure of infected cases (see the situation report on the February 17, 2020, in Ref. 13 ). Republic of Korea, on the other hand, focused on identifying infected patients immediately and isolating them to interrupt transmission. 14 It is interesting to note that for Japan, another country that adopted similar measures, we obtained a similar value for \u00b5.",

The most relevant characteristics of DC is that it will be zero if and only if (h) Japan, and (i) Republic of Korea, excluding days with <100 infected cases. The black-continuous curves represent the function \u03b1 + \u03b2t \u00b5 that fit the time-series, and the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u00b5 for each country are described in Table I . the data are independent and equal to one for maximal correlation between data. Details about the numerical procedure to obtain the DC are given in Appendix A. Figure 2 presents specific results for the DC calculated between some selected countries, namely, Brazil, Italy, Japan, and USA. Italy was chosen due to their relevance to Europe, regarding the typical data of the virus. USA was chosen for being the top affected country, and Brazil and Japan represent distinct continents and distinct epidemic containment measures. Thus, we compute the DC between four continents. Figures 2(a)-2(c), 2(g), 2(h), and 2(i) are the cumulative number of confirmed cases in each country, as in Fig. 1 , but considering data since the first day the infection was reported. In these curves, we clearly see the initial plateaus due to the incubation time. After the plateaus, a qualitative change to the power-law growth (the same from Fig. 1 ) occurs. The time for which the qualitative change occurs is distinct for each country. Fig. 2 (k); in both cases, DC is around 0.4. DC decays substantially when the power-law starts in one country but not in the other. The exception is between Japan and USA. After some days, when both countries reach the powerlaw behavior, the values of DC become very close to 1. Thus, they are highly correlated besides distinct exponents \u00b5. Furthermore, the DC is not necessarily related to the exponent \u00b5. One example can be mentioned. Even though USA has the largest exponent and Japan the lowest one (considering the error in Table I ), they are highly correlated. Besides that a even though there are not many data available for Brazil, it seems to become more and more correlated with Italy and Japan.",

In these cases, \u03ba s = 1, which means that we assume that all symptomatic individuals are properly isolated. Figures 3(c) and 3(d) show the evolution of scenarios for 120 days. The vertical axis is the cumulative number of positive infected individuals in the population. In the horizontal axis, we have the days since the first computed case in these countries. Black circles are the real data starting from the power-law-like behavior discussed in Sec. II. During the times for which real data are available, the model chooses the values of the parameters \u03b8 and \u03ba s that better adjust the simulation results with the data. In the cases shown in Fig. 3 , we needed three values of \u03b8 and \u03ba s , namely, the values \u03b8 eff and \u03ba eff s given in the figures. As a consequence, the red curves are in full agreement with the data in this time interval. When the available data end, the simulation continues and the red curves can be used to predict the asymptotic number of Chaos ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/cha confirmed cases since they represent the scenario following the tendency demonstrated by the data. In the case of Italy, we obtain 5.6 \u00d7 10 6 and for France, 1.0 \u00d7 10 7 . See the tendencies in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d). The considerable difference between these projections is explained by the last values of \u03b8 eff and \u03ba eff s obtained for these countries. Besides \u03b8 eff being larger for France, we obtain \u03ba eff s = 0, which can be interpreted as the nonexistence of quarantine measures or the inefficient isolation of symptomatic individuals. We are aware that such asymptotic behavior can be hardly trusted with numerical simulation of models. However, our intention in displaying such asymptotic behavior is to show that the proposed model converges to reasonable values. Now, we discuss results for some emblematic scenarios for the model when specific strategies are applied to Italy and France on day March 28th. For both countries, we assume \u03ba s = 1 for all strategies, which means that all symptomatic individuals per day are put into quarantine. We can see that the strategy represented by the orange curves is not sufficient to significantly reduce the total number of confirmed infected individuals for France, since the last value \u03b8 eff = 1.90 indicates a large level of social interaction in this country. On the other hand, for Italy, a considerable reduction is observed, specially for the orange-dashed curve, which indicates only the number of symptomatic cases. Strategies related to the blue curves mitigate the growth of the number of confirmed cases and, with exception of the dark blue case for Italy, lead to smaller asymptotic values when compared to the red and orange scenarios. The light blue curves, related to large social distance (\u03b8 = 0.8), are the most efficient scenarios to induce an accentuated reduction of the growth and a fast convergence to the maximal number of confirmed cases. Furthermore, green curves tend to approach the medium blue curves, which means that, for \u03b8 = 1.0, there is no significant difference between isolating 1% (\u03ba a = 0.01) of the asymptomatic individuals per day or doing nothing. However, increasing the daily ratio of detection and isolation of asymptomatic individuals to \u03ba a = 0.05, a noticeable reduction of the asymptotic value of infected individuals is observed (see magenta-dashed curves). Nevertheless, Chaos ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/cha none of these strategies are better than increasing the social distance, scenario represented by the light blue curves. Next, we discuss cases for Brazil and USA using other strategies. Results are shown in Figs. 4(a)-4(d), respectively. Figures 4(c) and 4(d) furnish predictions for the number of infected individuals. Due to the distinct scenarios, we had to change the colors a bit (see also color labels in Fig. 4) :",

In the case of Brazil and USA, we obtain two values of \u03b8 eff , as shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) with the corresponding numerical values. Red curves fit nicely the data as long as they are available. For the USA case, there were some difficulties in adjusting the parameters since the data show some irregularities. In the case for which the strategy does not change (\u03b8 = \u03b8 eff and \u03ba s = \u03ba eff s ), the red curves increase very much for both countries. Very high asymptotic values of infected individuals are reached, 3.4 \u00d7 10 7 cases for Brazil and 5.9 \u00d7 10 7 cases for USA. Now, we discuss results when new government strategies are applied to Brazil and USA on March 28th. All blue curves (dark to light) tend to mitigate the growth of the asymptotic number of cases for both countries. However, values of \u03b8 = 2.0 and 1.5 still lead to large asymptotic values. The case with \u03b8 = 1.0 is the most relevant strategy to flatten the curve efficiently. From the strategies that combine social distance with quarantine for the asymptomatic and mild symptomatic cases, stands out the inefficiency of the scenario with \u03b8 = 2.0 and \u03ba a = 0.20 to flatten the green curve. On the other hand, strategies with larger social distance (magenta and orange curves) lead to more promising scenarios. The better prediction emerges when using \u03b8 = 1.0 and \u03ba a = 0.10 (orange curves). For comparison, if we consider only the symptomatic cases, we obtain the asymptotic values 3.0 \u00d7 10 4 (light blue curve) and 1.6 \u00d7 10 4 (orange-dashed curve) for Brazil and 8.7 \u00d7 10 5 (light blue curve) and 4.6 \u00d7 10 5 (orange-dashed curve) for USA. As in the case of France and Italy, also for Brazil and USA, we observe that the social distance is the key element to reduce the growth rate of the maximum of symptomatic cases.",

Distinct power-law exponents for the countries are found and summarized in Table I . The power-law behavior suggests that the underlying propagation dynamics of the virus around these countries follows scale free networks, fractal kinetics, and small world features. 5, 6, 9 While power-laws with distinct exponents may look visually similar, it is necessary to quantify this similarity. For this, we compute the Distance Correlation 10-12 between all countries mentioned above (not shown). However, we use results for the DC from representative countries from four continents, namely, Brazil, Italy, Japan, and USA (see Fig. 2 ). They show that the power-law growth between these countries are highly correlated, even between North and South Hemispheres. The high correlation between the powerlaw curves of different continents strongly suggest that government strategies can be applied with success around the whole world.",

We apply numerically distinct strategies to flatten (or not) the power-law curves. Even though the social isolation, a well known benefit, is very powerful to flatten the curves, we found other strategies which lead to comparable results. For Italy and France, for example, the best scenario was obtained when reducing the social interaction to \u03b8 = 0.8 (light blue curves). However, if 5% of the asymptomatic and mild symptomatic individuals are identified and isolated everyday (\u03ba a = 0.05), asymptotic values of the same order of magnitude for the symptomatic cases were obtained even if \u03b8 = 1.0 (magentadashed curve). On the other hand, for Brazil and USA, our simulations confirm that to keep the social distance is essential to decrease the asymptotic number of infected individuals, and even better results could be obtained by increasing the tests to identify and isolate asymptomatic and mild symptomatic individuals (compare light blue and orange curves). The above combination between social interaction and the huge degree of isolation of infected individuals could be implemented to prevent economic catastrophes because people are not working. In other words, let some essential individuals go back to work (increasing \u03b8 ) and, simultaneously, increase by a huge amount the number of daily tests and isolation of infected individuals. This could furnish an efficient scenario to flatten the power-law.",
