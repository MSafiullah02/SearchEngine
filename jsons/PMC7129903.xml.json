Traditional vaccines are composed of either a whole pathogen, or its parts that induce a robust immune response [2]. However, they have not been effective against emerging pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis C virus [3] and instead have caused adverse effects. Such safety concerns have forced vaccine makers to shift their focus to subunit vaccines, composed of nucleic acids, recombinant proteins, or short peptide sequences, which favor safety over efficacy and may thus require additional immune stimulating agents, known as adjuvants [4]. These are essential components of modern vaccines, made of inorganic or polymeric materials, or macromolecular complexes, that are designed to enhance vaccine potency and the perdurance of immune responses [1]. Numerous compounds, including saponin, lecithin, mineral oils, and agar, have been investigated for their ability to enhance the effectiveness of antigens (Ags). Although most of these function as adjuvants in preclinical animal models, some have been identified as toxic and, therefore, unsuitable for use in humans. This has left aluminum compounds, used either alone or in combination with other compounds, as the major adjuvant in human vaccines [5]. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that these are ineffective against Ebola, influenza, tuberculosis, HIV infection, and malaria, which require complex immune responses, including the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity [3].",

To this end, novel vaccine delivery methods and adjuvants have been investigated [3]. The latter requires the development of complementary strategies to enhance the immune response toward a given Ag [7]. However, a critical challenge is to develop adjuvants with increased potency but minimal toxicity [8]. Only a few such compounds have reached clinical trial stages [9]. Biologics license applications for vaccines require evidence of strong safety/efficacy data from multi-center trials; purity, potency, and consistency between manufactured lots are also important. These stringent regulations pose an additional challenge to the development of new adjuvants [10].",

            "text": "PGA is a highly crystalline material that is susceptible to hydrolysis due to the ester bond present in the polymer backbone. As such, PGA is rapidly degraded, lacks mechanical strength, and produces an acidic environment. The hydrolysis of PGA to glycolide results in the activation of the classical complement pathway which leads to a strong, undesirable inflammatory response [30]. PLA is another important synthetic biopolymer that exist as different isomers; poly(l-lactic acid) and poly(d-lactic acid) have been studied in the context of vaccine development [17]. The additional methyl group in the PLA structure increases its hydrophobicity and stability against hydrolysis, as compared to PGA. PLA has been used for the preparation of microcapsules, microspheres, and nanospheres and is usually designed to achieve either controlled or pulsed release over a prolonged period [17]. For effective single vaccine delivery, pulsed release of Ag from the biopolymer matrix is essential [13]. An earlier study reported an enhancement in memory antibody response upon immunization with a single dose of tetanus toxin (TT)- or diphtheria toxin (DT)-loaded PLA particles [31]. Many studies since have highlighted the advantages of PLA\u2013polyethylene glycol (PEG) nanocarriers [32]. For example, Verma et al. reported that the PLA\u2013PEG-encapsulated M278 peptide (derived from the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) of Chlamydia) nanovaccine elicited strong CD4+ T cell-mediated immune effector responses, mixed Th1 and Th2 responses, mucosal IgA responses and protected mice against chlamydial genital tract challenge [32]. The major advantages of this anionic PLA biopolymer is the possibility of encapsulation or adsorption of one or numerous antigens, together with adjuvant molecules like receptor ligands, to improve the immunogenic potential of Ags [33].",

The biodegradation of PLGA yields biocompatible lactic and glycolic acid, which are ultimately removed from the body through the citric acid cycle [37]. The composition of PLGA determines its Ag or adjuvant encapsulation and release profiles [13], [27]. PLGA polymers with different stoichiometric ratios of lactic and glycolic acids, and different molecular weights, exhibit differences in Ag stability and release kinetics; for instance, PLGA with monomer ratios of 85:15, 75:25, and 50:50 have degradation times of 5\u20136, 4\u20135, and 1\u20132 months, respectively [27]. Thus, release kinetics can be predicted for different Ags or adjuvants, allowing long-term immune responses to be obtained from a single vaccination, without associated toxicity [13]. PLGA-based Ag carriers have been prepared as microspheres, microcapsules, and nanospheres to facilitate the controlled delivery of Ag payloads [11], [37], [38]. Poliomyelitis is a potentially fatal but vaccine-preventable infectious disease. However, 1 mL of the liquid inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) formulation is administered as two to three injections. While this is effective, it is infeasible in countries where patients may not have easy, or regular, access to healthcare. Interestingly, Tzeng et al. developed an injectable microparticle formulation of the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) which released multiple pulses of stable antigen over time. This single vaccine technology is currently of particular interest as successful eradication will require an enormous coverage rate, to ensure that the disease cannot be carried or transmitted by unvaccinated individuals [15].",

            "text": "PLGA has numerous advantages such as dendritic cell (DC) targeting, high stability, ease of processing, and protracted release [13], [39]. However, it also has limitations such as the production of an acidic microenvironment that can reduce Ag stability, and higher hydrophobicity, which decreases encapsulation efficiency and initial burst release, thereby altering the Ag release kinetics [13], [37], [40]. Nevertheless, such effects can be easily overcome by the inclusion of magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate [13]. Compared to alum adjuvants, PLGA biopolymers are inert carriers unless they have a specific composition or carry immunostimulants [41]. The adjuvant properties of PLGA particles are complex. In general, the uptake of Ags and adjuvant by APCs is facilitated by the delivery of the payload in particulate rather than soluble forms [42]. The cellular uptake of nano- and micro-sized PLGA particles is well documented [43]; these PLGA particles can protect Ag from premature proteolytic degradation and can function in vaccine delivery [44]. A variety of adjuvants and bacterial (hepatitis B virus [HBV] surface Ag [HBsAg] and Hip-B), viral (influenza), and parasite (malaria) Ags have been encapsulated or adsorbed onto PLGA nano-/microparticles [3], [11], [45], [46]. However, the clinical development of PLGA-NPs presents several challenges, including their synthetic hydrophobic surface, low transfection efficiency (for DNA vaccines), short circulation half-life, and nonspecific tissue distribution. We, and others, have investigated various surface engineering strategies to overcome these problems [47], [48], [49], [50]\n",

These BMNV platforms that mimin the key features of surface molecular organization and physicochemical properties, such as the size and shape of biological entities, have emerged as a new concept in cancer vaccine development. Integrating synthetic PLGA nanoparticles wrapped with cancer cell derived membranes (CCMC) holds tremendous potential for cancer immunotherapy. CCMC offers a full array of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) to immune cells, thereby stimulating robust tumor-specific immune responses [19]. We previously carried out extensive research on the preparation of cell membrane coated PLGA nanoparticles and demonstrated their potential biomedical applications [59]. In a recent study, Jin et al. demonstrated the potential application of human primary glioblastoma CCM (U87)-coated PLGA-NPs in cancer immunotherapy.

Other researchers tested hot saline extracts of Brucella ovis, encapsulated in PCL microparticles, as a vaccine against brucellosis infection in mice and found that the PCL\u2013hardystonite extract of the B. ovis vaccine enhanced Ag-specific immunogenicity, and that oral administration of these particles activated interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-2, and\u2014to a lesser degree\u2014IL-4, indicating a mixed Th1/Th2 cellular immune response [65]. In a study comparing PCL, PLGA, and PLGA\u2013PCL blended polymer NPs, loaded with DT Ag for mucosal vaccine delivery, PCL NPs induced a more potent DT-specific IgG antibody response than PLGA, which was positively correlated with polymer hydrophobicity [66]. Intranasal administration of Streptococcus equi Ag encapsulated in PCL NPs generated a strong mucosal immune response (secreted [s]IgA) in mice [67]. Similarly, HBsAg-loaded PCL microspheres administered intramuscularly evoked greater cellular (IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2) and humoral (IgG) responses in BALB/c mice than an alum-adjuvanted vaccine [68]. Chitosan-based surface modification of PCL NPs loaded with H1N1 hemagglutinin protein generated strong cellular and systemic/mucosal immune responses upon nasal administration [69]. A recent study investigating the long-term Ag release potential of PCL NPs encapsulating TT Ag and comparing the effect of PCL NP size (small, 61.2 nm and large, 467.6 nm) on immunological responses showed that particles <100 nm induced M1/M2-type macrophage polarization, Th1/Th2 polarization of autologous CD4+ T cells, and a CD8+ T cell response, whereas larger (450 nm) particles failed to induce polarization [70]. PCL and reduced aluminum adjuvant systems with TT as a model Ag induced higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 than conventional aluminum-adjuvanted formulations [71].",

            "text": "Polyphosphazene is a synthetic, biodegradable macromolecular polymer, with phosphorous and nitrogen linearly attached through alternating single and double bonds [72]. The two phosphorous side groups are open to conjugation via esterification, etherification, or amidification [72], [73]. Many studies have demonstrated the immunological adjuvant property of polyphosphazenes, and polyphosphazene-based polyelectrolytes can be used to prepare nano/micro-Ag carriers for Ag delivery [74]. Poly(di[sodium carboxlatophenoxy]phosphazene) (PCPP) salt is a potential mucosal adjuvant which can be combined with various Ags such as pertussis toxin, pneumococcal surface protein A, formalin-inactivated PR8 influenza virus, trivalent influenza virus, HBsAg, and HIV-1 LAI [73], [75], [76], [77]. The incorporation of an additional polyphosphazene immune modulator showed superior immunogenicity [74]. The multicarrier efficiency of PCPP microparticles has been demonstrated using different Ags and adjuvants (Fig. 5\n) [78]. For instance, the immunogenicity of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F protein Ag and CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), and immunomodulatory innate defense regulator peptide adjuvant encapsulated in polyphosphazene microparticles, stimulated strong immune responses and conferred complete protection in RSV-challenged animals [79]. Several studies investigating the mechanism of action of polyphosphazenes have suggested that poly(di[sodium carboxylatoethylphenoxy]phosphazene) (PCEP) activated the inflammasome through a caspase-dependent process, resulting in the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and -18. Furthermore, PCEP directly activated B cells to produce IgM and increased the production of Ag-specific IFN-\u03b3 by T cells [80]. These findings demonstrate that polyphosphazene-based synthetic biopolymers have immunological potential as adjuvants in modern vaccines.",

These are biocompatible, non-mutagenic and have been approved by the USFDA [7]. Since the first report of polyanhydride-based carriers, the capacity of polyanhydrides for immune stimulation, Ag sparing (single-dose vaccination), prolongation of Ag exposure, and other immunological activities have been explored [81], [82], [83], [84]. The degradation kinetics of polyanhydrides can be controlled by mixing rapidly degrading aliphatic polyanhydrides with their more slowly degrading aromatic counterparts to obtain polymers that encapsulate Ags in a stable manner. In contrast to the bulk erosion of PLGA polymers, polyanhydrides degrade by surface erosion, which ensures maximizes Ag release [81]. Polyanhydrides have numerous advantages over other synthetic polymers, such as high immunogenicity and capacity for Ag stabilization [7]. Sebacic acid, 1,6-bis (p-carboxyphenoxy) hexane, and 1,8-bis-(p-carboxyphenoxy)-3, 6-dioxaoctane are some of the hydrophobic moieties of polyanhydride that have been investigated for their adjuvant properties with diverse Ags [7], [85], [86]. Biofunctionalization of polyanhydride particles resulted in enhanced immune responses [87], [88]; and bioadhesive polymer (mannose or flagellin)-modified polyanhydride NPs, with OVA as the Ag, elicited robust systemic and mucosal immune responses in an animal model, after oral immunization [87]. In a similar study, functionalization of polyanhydride NPs with pathogen-mimicking carbohydrate structures, (galactose and di-mannose) to target C-type lectin receptors expressed by alveolar macrophages, increased particle uptake, production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 [88]. It was also found that the internalization of nanoparticles enhanced expression of CD40 which activates CD4+ T cells (Fig. 6\n) [88]. Interestingly, TLR-9 agonist\u2013CpG ODN-functionalized polyanhydride, with OVA as the Ag, had antitumor effects and enhanced CD8+ T cell and Ag-specific IgG1 antibody responses in mice [89]. Thus, polyanhydrides are potential vaccine adjuvants that can modulate the immune response, induce long-term immunity with a single administration, and deliver Ags in a safe and continuous manner via multiple routes of administration.",

Chitosans are of special interest for mucosal vaccine delivery owing to their bioadhesivity, biocompatibility, and low toxicity [16]. The mucoadhesive nature of chitosans is attributed to the electrostatic interactions between positively charged chitosan and negatively charged sialic acid residues on the mucosal surface [94]. Chitosan can induce the redistribution of cytoskeletal F-actin and the tight junction protein zona occludens-1, thus promoting paracellular permeability to hydrophilic macromolecules [95]. The mucoadhesive properties of chitosan prolong the residence time of formulations in mucosa associated lymphoid tissues (MALTs) [96]. Chitosan and its derivatives have been formulated as solutions, gels, powders, and microparticles/NPs to deliver Ags via various routes of administration [97]. Chitosan was shown to activate rat macrophages in vitro and exert local and systemic effects through the activation of cytokines such as TNF \u03b1, IL-12, IL-4, and IL-10, as well as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 [98].",

As an adjuvant for H5 inactivated influenza vaccines, administered intramuscularly in mice, chitosan increased antibody titers and conferred protection against homologous as well as drift variants of the influenza virus [100]. Furthermore, Ag-specific humoral and T (CD4+) cell-mediated immune responses to chitosan, delivered subcutaneously, along with \u03b2-galactosidase as the Ag were higher than responses to non-adjuvanted and alum-adjuvanted groups [101]. In another study, PLA\u2013chitosan microparticles encapsulating HBsAg stimulated serum-specific IgG to a greater extent than PLA/HBsAg microparticles and free HBsAg [102]. The greater adjuvant potency of chitosan, relative to alum, with the inactivated H5N1 influenza virus vaccine, was also demonstrated in mice [103].",

Another study showed that chitosan-adjuvanted Ag had higher immunogenicity than alum-adjuvanted vaccine in healthy human volunteers [105]. The Swedish company ViscoGel AB recently developed the chitosan-based adjuvant ViscoGel, which was found to be safe and effective in preclinical studies [106].

These MBL interactions have been correlated with DC trafficking and induction of both humoral and cellular responses [110]. Mannan derivatives such as the reduced and oxidized forms have dual activity towards APCs\u2014namely, inducing phenotypic variation and functional maturation of DC cells. These derivatives also induce the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, as well as Th1/Th2 cytokines. The oxidized form of mannan stimulated a Th1-type CTL response with high IFN-\u03b3 secretion, no IL-4 release, and a predominant IgG2 antibody response, whereas the reduced form stimulated Th2-type responses with IL-4 production and a predominant IgG1 antibody response, but no IFN-\u03b3 [5]. Intranasal administration of oxidized mannan with recombinant protein Ags induced a more potent immunological response than cholera toxin through the production of sIgA, in various mucosal secretions, and Ag-specific IgG1 and IgG2a in serum [111].",

This microbial polysaccharide, and its sulfated derivative, have immunogenic and pro-inflammatory effects in mice. Diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-dextran, a polycationic derivative containing DEAE groups linked to glucose, has been evaluated as a veterinary adjuvant for inactivated virus vaccines since the 1970s. Although its mechanism of action is not clear, its effects on the humoral response are recognized and suggest that DEAE-dextran stimulates and polarizes the response to Th2 for antibody synthesis as detected when administered with formalin-inactivated Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus [5], [92], [116]. Dextran nanospheres with entrapped Ag and DEAE have also been used as adjuvants [117]. Whole cell cholera Ag and DEAE\u2013dextran were shown to enhance immune responses [118], while DEAE\u2013dextran adjuvant, combined with whole-cell typhoid vaccine, was more effective by the active mouse protection test than TT-adjuvanted vaccine or Ag alone [119]. Acetylated dextran (Ac-DEX) is a dextran derivative that can be synthesized by reversible modification of dextran hydroxyl groups with acetal motifs [120]. Modifying the properties of Ac-DEX based particles was shown to alter Ag presentation in MHC I and II presentation assays [121].",

Lentinan was shown to stimulate the proliferation of blood mononuclear cells such as lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages and increase resistance to malignant transformation, and was demonstrated as an effective adjuvant for T cells [129]. DNA vaccination can induce specific CD8+ T cell immune responses, but at a relatively low level in humans, due to their large size. Lentinan has been evaluated for its potential to maximize the immunity elicited by DNA vaccines [130]. Lentinan has shown immunomodulatory abilities against respiratory influenza virus infection [131], and acted synergistically with Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin Ag in activating alveolar macrophages [132]. Furthermore, lentinan showed immunotherapeutic effects along with DC vaccines in the treatment of B16 melanoma. The presence of lentinan enhanced the efficiency of gp100+ DCs through activation of T and natural killer cell populations via stimulation of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 production [133]. The adjuvant potency of the synthetic \u03b2-(1 \u2192 6)-branched \u03b2-(1 \u2192 3) glucohexose analog of lentinan (\u03b2-glu6) was demonstrated in conjunction with HBV core Ag ([HBcAg]-pB144)-encoding DNA vaccines in mice. Lentinan (\u03b2-glu6) enhanced the recruitment and maturation of APCs and CD8+ and CD4+ T cell activation and increased the size of the T cell population [130]. Finally, in BALB/c mice, \u03b2-glu6-adjuvanted HBsAg vaccine elicited both humoral and cellular immune responses by promoting APC maturation, Ag presentation, and activation of CD4+ T cells, leading to IL-4 expression and anti-HBV antibody production [134].",

In BALB/c mice, HIV-1 DNA vaccine combined with zymosan enhanced the humoral and cellular immune responses via an alternative pathway that promoted the recruitment and activation of APCs [136]. Zymosan activates the inflammasome of macrophages and DCs through cryopyrin inflammasome and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain [137]. In addition, zymosan acted synergistically with mucosal adjuvant poly(I:C) in influenza vaccines. Zymosan may enhance the adjuvant activity of poly(I:C) by increasing the production of cytokines (i.e., IL-6, IL-10, IFN-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1) by DCs, resulting in simultaneous activation of poly(I:C)-induced TLR3-mediated and zymosan-induced TLR2-mediated signaling pathways [138]. Interestingly, the latter could provide a basis for developing a neonatal vaccine adjuvant since the immaturity of TLR-mediated innate immunity in neonates depends on monocytes rather than on DCs [139].",

Both CMC and QC come from cellulose, which is a natural material with good tolerance by the body [140]. Moreover, the formation of CMC\u2013QC nanoparticles is through physical crosslinking by electrostatic interactions instead of chemical bonds, therefore possible toxicity or deactivation caused by chemical crosslinking reagents is avoided [140].

In addition, OVA/\u03b3-PGA nanovaccines conferred resistance to tumor challenge by EG7-OVA cells and inhibited lung metastasis by B16-OVA cells [153], and the effects were confirmed in a separate study [154]. Infection-mimicking OVA/\u03b3-PGA-NPs enhanced the functions of DCs such as Ag uptake, migration to lymph nodes, and cross-presentation, and vaccination with OVA/\u03b3-PGA-NPs protected mice against EG7-OVA tumor challenge, suppressing tumor growth and generating a long-lasting immune response (Fig. 8\n) [155]. Interestingly, tailored immune responses can be induced by \u03b3-PGA-nanovaccines, for instance by fine-tuning hydrophobic amino acid ethyl esters (AAE) in the \u03b3-PGA-AAE-/OVA nanocomplexes. Finally, a \u03b3-PGA-graft-l-phenylalanine ethyl ester-based polyion complex is a potential Ag carrier and adjuvant [156]. Thus, \u03b3-PGA-NPs have excellent adjuvant potential and act through TLR-4 by stimulating both arms of the immune response.",

            "text": "Biodegradable materials can serve as a basis for the development of subunit Ag-based prophylactic or nucleic acid-based therapeutic vaccines owing to their biocompatibility and minimal toxicity, which can ensure safety and therapeutic efficacy. In this review, we discussed representative biodegradable polymers and the immune responses that they elicit. In most cases, biomaterial-based particulate vaccines delivering Ags or acting as adjuvants have been shown to enhance immune responses as compared to formulations comprising the Ag alone. In particular, mucoadhesive polymers and polymers that have the intrinsic ability to increase cross-presentation of Ags and induce CTL-mediated immune response are a significant improvement over classical alum-adjuvanted vaccines. These biomaterials can accelerate the clinical translation of new vaccines against Ebola, TB, and HIV infection and cancer. However, a greater understanding of the physiochemical properties (e.g., size, shape, and charge) of biomaterials and the mechanisms by which they stimulate immunity is needed to develop more effective vaccines. In addition, recent advances in materials engineering can be applied to customize vaccines to meet specific immunological needs. For instance, the recent development of artificial Ag-presenting cells and cell membrane-mediated biofunctionalization approaches are useful tools in the rapidly growing field of immunotherapy.",
