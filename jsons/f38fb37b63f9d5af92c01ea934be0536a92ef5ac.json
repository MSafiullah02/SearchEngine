            "text": "double suction. We showed double suction was effective in removing smoke (a far from perfect human aerosol model) from under the modified transparent drapes. Nevertheless, we caution that the over-use of suction may collapse the plastic barrier. In addition, we have still yet to understand whether sustained suction may re-aerosolize particles. When suction devices are used, they should include the appropriate filters. Barrier techniques are adjuncts and should not replace the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including during the process of barrier removal. Where PPE shortages may persist, well researched and validated barrier techniques may enhance provider safety. We posit that the risk posed by the free release of aerosols and droplets into the environment during a cough may be higher compared with the use of the three-drape that allows containment and safe removal of fomites, as shown in our work. 2 We do caution that there is no validated human cough model, and many experimental designs will include the use of materials such as smoke, Glo Germ TM , fluorescein, tonic water containing quinine, as fluorescing surrogates for human cough constituents. 5 The results of these experiments need to be interpreted with the inherent limitations of these models and experimental conditions. In addition, the use of barriers should not compromise safe airway management. In the meantime, we encourage clinicians and scientists to continue iterative improvements on the simple clear plastic barrier by asking, testing and using sound methodology, and sharing their findings.",
