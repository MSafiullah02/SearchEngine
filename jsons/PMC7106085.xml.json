Of all the participants in this symposium I have the distinction of having had no first-hand experience with SARS. Nevertheless, I do have some credentials. In March of 2003 I travelled to and through Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taipei, Seoul and Narita and realised on my trip back to Los Angeles on March 17th that I needed a chapter on SARS for the 5th edition of our book \u2018Textbook of Pediatric Infectious Diseases\u2019 which was soon to be published. So, with the help of four Hong Kong colleagues this chapter was written in under 2 weeks and is the most complete reference to date relating to paediatrics.1\n",

He recovered but his wife, aunt, and aunt's daughter all became ill.14 Subsequently, several independent clusters of cases were noted in seven municipalities in Southern China. From November 10, 2002 until February 9, 2003 there were 305 cases of SARS identified in Guangdong Province. Many of the afflicted patients were healthcare workers. The first identified spread of SARS to Hong Kong occurred on February 21, 2003. This involved a 64-year-old physician from Zhongshan University in Guangdong Province who travelled to Hong Kong to attend a wedding. Prior to his hospitalisation in Hong Kong he stayed in the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong for 1 day. Subsequently, 10 secondary cases occurred in other hotel guests and these infected and ill persons led directly to tertiary cases in two Hong Kong hospitals and outbreaks in Singapore, Toronto and Hanoi.15\n",

The SARS virus grew in Vero cell and fetal rhesus kidney cell tissue cultures. Cytopathic effect was noted in the Vero cell cultures in 5 to 6 days and in the fetal rhesus kidney cell cultures in 2 to 4 days.[16], [17] This virus, which was a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was rapidly identified using both conventional virologic methods and cutting edge molecular biology. The genome was completely and rapidly sequenced in several laboratories.[4], [5], [6], [7], [8] This was a significant accomplishment when one realises that coronaviruses have the largest genomes (30 000 bases of positive-strand RNA) found in any RNA virus. Sequence data allowed the rapid development of highly specific diagnostic tests and also helped in the epidemiologic study of the mini pandemic.",

Dr. Carlo Urbani from the WHO office answered the call and rapidly determined that the illness which had spread throughout the hospital was unusual. He carried out an extensive on-site investigation and worked with the hospital staff to set up quarantine procedures. His efforts led to the containment of SARS in Hanoi. Unfortunately, he became ill with SARS on March 11, 2003 and died in an isolation room in a Bangkok hospital on March 29, 2003. He did not live to see the worldwide successes of SARS control which resulted to a great extent from his early detection of SARS.",
