It causes significant losses in meat and egg producing chickens due to its effects on growth rates, egg production and quality, and mortality in infected flocks. There is no effective treatment, and vaccination with attenuated vaccine strains is the major tool used to prevent the losses in production caused by IBV in Australia (Chousalkar et al., 2009). Inactivated vaccines are used outside Australia, normally as part of vaccination programs in combination with live attenuated vaccines, particularly in layer and breeder flocks.",

However, one of the most important mechanisms underlying the emergence of new strains is genomic recombination (Jia et al., 1995). The emergent virulent strain Ark DPI appears to have originated from recombination between four different IBV strains (Ammayappan et al., 2008). Additionally, the emergence of new strains of IBV in the USA has been reported to have arisen from recombination events between the Massachusetts (Mass), Conn and Holte strains and field strains (Thor et al., 2011).",

The origin of subgroup 2 strains has remained unknown, but as the S1 gene of this subgroup shares less than 64% nucleotide (nt) sequence identity with those of subgroup 1 (vaccine related) strains (Sapats et al., 1996), it has been assumed that they may have arisen from a coronavirus exogenous to chickens (Mardani et al., 2008). The subgroup 3 strains, which were first isolated in 2002\u20132003, have an S1 gene that differs considerably from those of subgroup 1 and 2 strains, with nucleotide identities of 61\u201363% and 56\u201359%, respectively (Ignjatovic et al., 2006). Phylogenetic and similarity plot analyses of the genomic region encoding the structural genes have suggested that this subgroup emerged as a result of recombination between subgroup 1 and 2 strains (Ignjatovic et al., 2006, Mardani et al., 2010). The strain Ck/Aus/N1/08 (N1/08) was isolated from a flock of chickens with clinical signs of respiratory disease that had previously been vaccinated against IB. Analysis of the section of the genome encoding the structural proteins found evidence of recombination in the S1 gene, with the subgroup 2 strain N1/88 and a subgroup 3 strain as possible parental viruses (Hewson et al., 2014).",

After 48 h incubation, the allantoic fluid (AF) was aseptically collected. The AF extracted from the embryonated eggs was clarified and the virus purified as described previously (Lougovskaia et al., 2002), with minor modifications. Briefly, the AF was clarified by centrifugation at 2,500 \u00d7 \ng for 20 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 \u00d7 \ng for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. Viral pellets were then resuspended in 200 \u03bcL of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (pH 7.4), and this viral suspension was layered over a 30% to 55% continuous sucrose gradient in TBS. The gradient was centrifuged at 100,000 \u00d7 \ng for 4 h at 4 \u00b0C. The virus band was resuspended in TBS and the viral particles pelleted by centrifugation at 90,000 \u00d7 \ng for 1 h and the pellet resuspended in 250 \u03bcL of TBS. The genomic RNA was extracted using RNeasy kits (Qiagen), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for RNA extraction from cell cultures and tissues, with minor modifications (Asia Pacific Centre of Animal Health protocol for RNA extraction from allantoic fluid). In summary, the initial denaturation was performed by mixing 100 \u03bcL of the viral pellet with 400 \u03bcL of lysis buffer plus 5 \u03bcL of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and the mixture was incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight. A 300 \u03bcL volume of 70% ethanol was added to the lysate. For the steps with washing buffers, the time and speed were changed from 15 to 30 s, and from 8000 to 10,000 \u00d7 \ng. The final centrifugation at full speed was performed for 2 min instead of 1 min, and the speed during the elution step was modified from 8000 to 10,000 \u00d7 \ng.",

Sequencing was performed using the PGM Ion Torrent\u2122 platform (Life Technologies), with a 314 chip and the 200-base sequencing Ion OneTouch Kit v2. All the sequencing protocols were performed at the Monash Health Translation Precinct (MHTP) medical genomics facility, within the Monash Institute of Medical Research, Victoria, Australia. All reads were compared to chicken ribosomal RNA and mitochondrial genome sequences, and the matching reads were discarded. The remaining reads were mapped using the genome sequences of the Beaudette strain of IBV, two IBV vaccine strains from the United States (strains Conn46 1996 and Massachusetts; Genbank accession numbers FJ904716 and GQ504724, respectively), and two strains from China (SAIBK and SC021202; Genbank accession numbers DQ288927 and EU714029, respectively) as reference sequences, using Geneious version 6.1.4 (Biomatters). Because of the high level of sequence diversity of the S gene, the reads were also mapped using the previously determined sequences of the entire structural protein gene region (from the S glycoprotein to the 3\u2032 end) of the Australian strains Armidale, N1/08, N1/88, VicS-del and VicS (accession numbers DQ490205, JN176213, DQ490207, JN983807 and JN176213, respectively), and the sequences of the S and N genes of N1/03 (accession numbers FJ235186 and FJ235194, respectively).

Automasking was used for the optimal detection of recombination breakpoints (Thor et al., 2011). Default settings were used for most algorithms. Changes from default settings were the window size for RDP (60) and Bootscan (500), the window and step size for SiScan (500 and 20, respectively), and the number of variable sites per window for MaxChi and Chimaera (120). The size of the window was increased from the default to reduce masking of recombination signals within IBV, which has a high mutation rate (Thor et al., 2011). The recombination breakpoint plot was calculated with a window of 200 nt. The breakpoint plot was constructed using a 200 bp window moved 2 nucleotides at a time along the length of the genome (Fig. 4).

Furthermore, the Australian clade is equally or more divergent, compared to the other IBV genomes included in this study, than the TCoV clade (particularly the N1/88 strain). The network tree constructed using only Australian isolates (Fig. 1B) confirmed the recombination events that have been detected between these isolates and also highlighted how the Armidale and N1/88 strains have diverged. Both network trees provided strong evidence of recombination and yielded a highly significant phi test (P < 0.001).

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus is a highly prevalent virus, causing economic losses in the chicken industry globally (Jackwood and de Witt, 2013). Infectious bronchitis virus strains have been continuously monitored in Australian chickens since the first characterisation and isolation of the aetiological agent of \u2018nephrosis\u2019 syndrome in the 1960s (Cumming, 1962). One of the principal milestones of this monitoring was the discovery of the subgroup 2 strains at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s (Sapats et al., 1996). These viruses had S1gp and N protein gene sequences that were very distinct from those of the strains that had been encountered previously. This clade of strains also has a translocation and deletion of some accessory protein genes (Mardani et al., 2008, Hewson et al., 2011). However, since only the structural and accessory genes in the 7.5 kb region at the 3\u2032 end of the genome had been sequenced previously, the available information suggested that the origin of the subgroup 2 strains was from a coronavirus completely distinct from the strains already circulating in Australian chicken flocks. The determination of the complete sequences of the polymerase genes presented in this study now suggests that N1/88 originated in part from IBV strains already circulating in the field, as well as from an avian coronavirus of unknown origin. Phylogenetic analysis of different strains of IBVs isolated from different countries (Fig. 1) supported previous suggestions that Australian strains of IBV have been diverging as an independent cluster (Quinteros et al., 2015). However, the representation of genetic divergence by a phylogenetic tree alone may not be accurate, because once a branch is created no further potential interactions between the branches are represented (Thor et al., 2011). In network trees, boxes represent the likelihood that there has been recombination between two different branches. The IBV Network Splitstree (Fig. 1) suggested considerable intra-clade interactions, with a significantly lower number of inter-clade interactions, supporting suggestions that Australian IBVs have been genetically isolated for a considerable time (Ignjatovic et al., 2006, Quinteros et al., 2015). This could be explained by the geographic location of Australia as an island and the enclosed nature of the Australian ecosystem, and also by the biosecurity barriers imposed by Australian authorities on biological imports. It is likely that IBV vaccine strains may have played a significant role in intra-clade recombination events in Australia. Because of the high reliance on live attenuated vaccines in Australia, there is a high probability that co-infection with a field strain and a vaccine strain could occur. The chimaeric pattern of relationships between the three Australian isolates of IBV characterised here and the two most distinct vaccine strains in use suggests that this has happened multiple times, as summarized in Fig. 3.",

            "text": "As has been reported previously, there is a high level of divergence between the sequence of N1/88 and the vaccine strains in the region of the genome encoding the structural and accessory proteins (downstream of nt 20,000) (Mardani et al., 2008). In the region encoding the polymerase genes, the genome sequence was highly similar to VicS. This suggests that, for the emergent N1/88 strain, the donor of the polymerase genes was most likely to have been VicS or a VicS-like strain, while the donor of the structural protein genes remains unknown, as reported previously (Mardani et al., 2008). This may suggest that the polymerase genes from the parental virus that served as the source of the structural genes were poorly adapted to chicken cells, and that the emergence of N1/88 was driven not only by the antigenic differences between this virus and other circulating IBVs, but also by an enhanced capacity of the recombinant virus to replicate in chickens. A similar scenario could be behind the emergence of N1/08. A previous study comparing the sequences of the N1/08 structural genes suggested that the emergence of this virus could be due to a recombination event between a subgroup 2 strain (N1/88) and a subgroup 3 strain (N1/03) (Hewson et al., 2014) (Fig. 4; last third of the genome, from nt 20,000 to the 3\u2032 end). However, it is possible that N1/08 could have resulted from an independent recombination event with VicS-v, rather than with N1/03, with recombination breakpoints located between 181 and 1114 bp upstream of the start codon of S1gp (nt 19,242\u201320,175) and between 1278 and 1320 bp downstream of the protease cleavage site (nt 23,259\u201323,301) for the S1 and S2 gp genes (Table 1, Fig. 4, letters j and m). However an N1/03-like strain, which could be a recombinant derived from N1/03 and Armidale, could also be one of the parental strains, with N1/08 derived from recombination between this virus, VicS and N1/88 (Fig. 5 and Table 1). It is difficult to infer the exact order of these recombination events, as the recombinational history of N1/08 appears to be extremely complex.",

            "text": "Although the S1gp gene sequence of N1/08 is very similar to that of N1/88, the subgroup 2 strains have not been isolated from any IB outbreak in Australia for over 20 years. Therefore, it is possible that the unknown avian coronavirus donor of the structural and accessory genes of N1/88 is continuing to recombine with IBV vaccine strains, leading to the emergence of new strains. The detection of this \u201cunknown avian coronavirus\u201d donor will be crucial to better understanding the origin and evolution of these new recombinant strains. There is prior evidence of interspecies recombination in avian coronaviruses, in the emergence of turkey coronavirus (TCoV). The genome of TCoV is very similar to that of IBV, except for the gene for the S gp, and, as in the case with the emergence of N1/88, the parental donor of the spike glycoprotein gene remains unknown (Lin et al., 2004, Jackwood et al., 2010). These interspecies recombination processes have also been described in other members of the family Coronaviridae. It has been suggested that Rp3, a severe-acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2013like coronavirus from bats, may have originated by recombination between another SARS-like coronavirus (Bt-SLCoV Rm1) and a human SARS coronavirus (Hu-SCoV) (Hon et al., 2008). Interestingly, the recombination breakpoint in Rp3 is located around the ORF 1b/S junction, which is the site at which recombination between the VicS-like parental virus and the unknown parental virus of N1/88 occurred (Fig. 3).",

            "text": "Previous experimental inoculation studies in chickens have revealed that the N1/08 strain has tropism for tracheal tissue, inducing only mild lesions, as was seen in earlier experiments with the subgroup 2 strain N1/88 (Ignjatovic et al., 1997, Hewson et al., 2014). In contrast, the subgroup 3 strain N1/03 causes moderate to severe tracheal lesions and clinical signs, together with an increase in mortality and reduced growth rates (Ignjatovic et al., 2006). The analysis of the nt similarities between N1/88 and N1/08, and between N1/03 and N1/08, to determine genetic factors that may be associated with these differences in phenotype revealed a high similarity between the S1gp nt sequences of N1/88 and N1/08 (93.8%), and much lower similarity with the S1 gp gene sequence of N1/03 (65.3 (Hewson et al., 2014). However, it has been demonstrated that the replicase genes, rather than the structural genes, may be more closely associated with the level of virulence of an IBV strain (Armesto et al., 2009). The only peptide gene in the polymerase region in which N1/08 is more similar to N1/88 than to N1/03 is the nsp14 gene. Nsp14 has been shown to have 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease (ExoN) and guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activity in other members of the family Coronaviridae (Chen et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2013, Smith and Denison, 2012). The ExoN belongs to the DEDD superfamily (Asp-Glu-Asp-Asp), and these conserved residues (Smith and Denison, 2012) are found in the nsp14 of 75 strains of IBV at positions 89, 91, 241, 271 respectively (data not shown). There are also 3 highly conserved amino acid motifs (I, II and III) in the nsp14 of all coronaviruses with the DEDD signature (Minskaia et al., 2006). Studies in SARS-CoV have revealed that changes in the amino acid residues within motif I impair viral growth rates and lead to higher levels of viral mutations in progeny after several passages in cell culture (Eckerle et al., 2010). The predicted amino acid sequence alignment of N1/88, N1/03 and N1/08 revealed differences in motif I and in the residues at positions 113 and 455 (Fig. 6). It is possible that these changes could lead to conformational changes in this protein, especially the cysteine to glycine substitution, which could alter the function of either the ExoN or N7-MTase. However, it is more likely that these changes, in combination with other small changes in the polymerase peptides are jointly, rather than individually, responsible for the differences in virulence in these IBVs.",

However, similarity plot analysis of the isolates indicates that this is not likely to be the case. The nucleotide sequence of the S gene of N1/03 was equally dissimilar to both subgroup 1 and 2 strains. When the Armidale strain (subgroup 1) was used as the query, the S1 genes of N1/88 and N1/03 appeared to be similar. However, as shown in Fig. 7\nB, when N1/03 (subgroup 3) was used as the query the sequence of its S gene was found to be quite distant from that of strain N1/88, especially in the S1gp region (the first half of the S gene), with a similarity below 50%. Thus the origin of the subgroup 3 strain is most likely due to a recombination event between subgroup 1 strains and an unknown S1 gene donor that was quite distant from the donor of the same gene in the subgroup 2 strains, probably another unknown avian coronavirus, suggesting that there are multiple distant avian coronaviruses with the capacity to recombine with IBVs and contribute to future IBV diversity.",

The protein that induces neutralising antibodies against IBV is the S1gp, and these antibodies confer protection against disease (Cavanagh et al., 1986, Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994). All the Australian vaccines belong to subgroup 1 and the amino acid sequence of the S1gp of this subgroup differs from those of subgroup 2 and 3 viruses (Ignjatovic et al., 2006, Hewson et al., 2011). Although antibodies induced by the N protein are not protective (Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994), peptides derived from it are recognised by T cells, and it is thus believed to play a role in the induction of cell mediated immunity (Boots et al., 1991, Saif, 1993, Seo et al., 1997). N1/08 is the only strain characterised thus far that shares a high sequence identity in either its S1 and/or N genes with members of all the Australian subgroups of IBV. The potential for this virus to induce cross protection against members of all other subgroups needs to be assessed to validate this hypothesis.",
