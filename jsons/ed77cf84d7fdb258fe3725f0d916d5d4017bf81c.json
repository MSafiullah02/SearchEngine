The viral RNA from 2019-nCoV was detected in both respiratory samples by the use of two RT-PCRs, a first-line screening assay targeting E gene and a confirmatory assay targeting RdRp gene (3). Additional specimens were collected and tested during the following days show other viral carriage sites (Table 1). Only paracetamol was prescribed. The 2019-nCoV RT-PCR signal in nasopharyngeal swab remained positive at the same level since diagnosis but no clinical deterioration 12 days after the contact. Occurrence of further contamination and management among other tour group members are unknown. French Public Health Services focused on contact tracing to avoid secondary cases among patients visited by the physician. Fortunately to date, none of tested contacts were found positive for 2019-nCoV. This case report confirms the risk of transmission of 2019-nCoV to HCW in France, as already evidenced in Wuhan where 3,6% of the first 417 cases were HCW (4). We strongly recommend that all HCW use contact and respiratory precautions when visiting patients with respiratory symptoms or/and flu-like illness in all areas with presumed ongoing community transmission of 2019-nCoV.",
