Respiratory illness rates in boys and girls are highest in children 2 years of age and younger. 4,6-9 Because estimates of attack rates vary to some degree according to the type of surveillance for a given population, comparisons between studies are somewhat difficult. However, in a recent community study in which enrollees were surveyed weekly and cultured for each respiratory illness, infants younger than 2 years of age had a mean number of 5.7 respiratory illnesses per year. 4 The respiratory illness rate did not drop below 3 illnesses per year until subjects reached 15 years of age, and mean number of illnesses then averaged 2 per year. In circumstances for which diagnoses have been obtained, rhi'noviruses accounted for 11% to 25% of all physician visits.4,L0, 11 Clearly, many respiratory infections go unrecognized in tallies of their impact, because affected children are never evaluated by a physician and are treated at home. Therefore, another estimate of the frequency of respiratory infection may be obtained from the prevalence of over-the-counter (OTC) drug use for treatment of \"cold\" symptoms. According to a recent analysis of a nationally representative sample, 35% of all 3-year-old children in the United States were given an OTC cold or cough medication in the preceding 30 days. 12 This likely represents an underestimate of the total number of respiratory illnesses; children who sought a physician's advice were less likely to receive OTC medications, and use of prescription medications was not captured in this study.",

More than 50% of the estimated cost was attributable to hospitalization. The majority of episodes correlated with the presence of four viruses in the community--respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, parainfluenza 1, and parainfluenza 3. In our 20-year experience (1973 to 1993) with cohorts of children followed from birth in the Vanderbilt Vaccine Evaluation Unit (VVEU), we have observed a total of 8,454 respiratory infections in 4,093 childyears of observation. The total rate of medically attended respiratory illness was 310.3 episodes per 100 child-years, for children younger than 2 years of age and 102.7 per 100 child-years for children age 2 to 5 years. We have observed a lower respiratory infection rate of 25.7 per 100 child-years during the first 2 years of life and 7.3 per 100 child-years for age 2 to 5 years. Although respiratory infections peak in winter months, otitis media and lower respiratory infections occur throughout the year and average nearly 50% of rates in peak months (Fig 1) .

The National Academy of Sciences Board on Science and Technology for International Development (BOSTID) determined much of what is known today about risk factors, pathogens, symptoms, and disease severity of ARI in the developing world.IS Incidence rates from the BOSTID studies ranged from 12.7 to 27.5 respiratory illnesses per 100 child-weeks at risk; the highest rate was observed when mild upper respiratory infections were included. ~8 More lower respiratory tract infections were identified by auscultation in the home than were identified by examination of ill subjects in a clinic setting. Hence, the overall impact of LRI in a developing setting may be underestimated, and comparisons between different studies necessarily should pay strict attention to methods of surveillance. Children 5 years old or younger were observed to spend up to 40% and 14% of observed weeks with signs of respiratory infection and LRI, respectively} 8",

Emphasis on environmental controls, improved compliance with therapy, and novel approaches to contact identification have all been recommended to reduce the impact of tuberculosis. 65 Controlled inquiries into interventions that improve the nutritional status of children also are needed. Inexpensive vitamin or micronutrient supplementation may reduce the morbidity and mortality of respiratory disease, as has occurred with vitamin A supplementation for measles.

Over 20 years of observation in the Vanderbilt VEU, 23.7% of doctor visits for culture-confirmed RSV have been in infants younger than 6 months old, despite a mean age of 15.7 months for culture-confirmed RSV infection. Over 50% of hospitalizations for RSV infection in this population were in healthy infants younger than 3 months old.",
