Prescott (2000) recommended that the doxycycline be given in two doses of 10 mg/kg orally, followed by 5 mg/kg orally. Antibiotics are not generally recommended to be injected intra-articularly since this may provoke chemical synovitis. In order to keep the antibiotic level as high as possible in the affected joint, the high dose of 10 mg/kg was also continued for the maintenance therapy. The cat did not show any side effects during the administration period. For treatment of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy diltiazem (Dilzem; Goedecke), 8 mg orally twice daily was chosen because of its negative inotropic effect and positive lusitropic effect. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, 1\u00c125 mg benazepril hydrochloride (Fortekor; Novartis) orally once daily, was added to alleviate the effects of the secondary mitral valve insufficiency by reducing cardiac pre-and afterload.",

            "text": "Commonly involved organisms in joint infections in cats are Pasteurella multocida and haemolytic strains of Escherichia coli (Pedersen and others 2000) . Bacterial L-form infections do occur and are manifested by fistulating subcutaneous wounds, which frequently spread to local and distant joints by local extension or haematogenously (Carro and others 1989) . Two Mycoplasma species have been implicated as having pathogenic significance in the cat. While M gateae is usually recovered as a commensal of the respiratory and urogenital tract, Moise and others (1983) were able to infect healthy immunocompetent and immunosuppressed experimental cats with M gateae. Polyarthritis was induced in all the animals by iv inoculation; thus, a haematogenous spread is likely to be possible. This seems to occur in natural infections as well. M felis has been variously incriminated as a cause of feline conjunctivitis (Blackmore and Hill 1973 , Campbell and others 1973 , Haesebrouck and others 1991 , although this disease is often seen in conjunction with other more pathogenic agents (Blackmore and Hill 1973, Campbell and others 1973) . Hooper and others (1985) cultured M felis from the synovial fluid from septic joints in one cat. It had had a severe lymphocytic deficiency for its whole life and subsequently developed a multitude of illnesses culminating in severe polyarthritis. Bonilla and others (1997) reported arthritis of the left hip and right knee joint caused by M felis in a woman following exposure to cats. In both cases, there is no evidence of direct trauma, so again haematogenous spread seems to be the most likely explanation for the joint involvement. In cat 1, no joint-penetrating injury could be confirmed, but injury due to acute blunt trauma cannot be excluded; thus, a systemic spread of M felis and subsequent manifestation in the possibly preinjured tarsus seem feasible. Although not reported previously, endocardial manifestation of the infection is possible; however, cardiac ultrasound did not reveal any signs of myocarditis and/or endocarditis.",

Since the disease did not respond adequately over a 10-day period and the radiograph revealed increased swelling of the involved elbow region, the joint was also treated surgically. Only Mycoplasma organisms were present at the time of surgery. Taking into account that the cat had received antibiotic treatment for a period of time before surgery, the possibility that more pathogenic bacteria could have been the initial cause for the arthritis cannot be ruled out. It was concluded that M felis had at least perpetuated the arthritis, if not substantially caused it.",
