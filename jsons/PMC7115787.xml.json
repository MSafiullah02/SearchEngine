The risk of contracting HCV from unprocessed tissue that is NAT HCV negative is estimated to be 1 in 421,000.21 McAllister and colleagues9 noted that the current risk of an allograft-transmitted infection appears to be much less than the overall risk of perioperative nosocomial infection.",

In 2005, the FDA set up 3 new regulations for entities involved in human tissue products: \u201cregistration\u201d rules for tissue banking institutions, \u201cdonor eligibility\u201d rules that provide criteria for donor screening and selection, and \u201ccurrent good tissue practices\u201d rules that concern tissue procurement, processing, and distribution.25 Currently, there is more federal oversight of tissue banks and improved donor screening and testing techniques, including the use of NAT. In the United States, all establishments that collect, process, or handle human cells, tissues, and cellular or tissue-based products must now register with the FDA.",

Seto and colleagues49 used crosslinkers, including 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and glucose to add exogenous crosslinks to collagen and compared their effects to those of free radical scavengers (mannitol, ascorbate, and riboflavin) in rabbit tendons. Both treatments protected mechanical properties at 25 kGy, but at 50 kGy crosslinkers were superior. The strength, modulus of elasticity, toughness, and strain of glucose-treated tendon, either gamma or electron-beam irradiated at 25 kGy, were close to those of native tendon.

Freeze-drying alters the material properties of collagen but has not been shown to have a clinical effect.20 One study58 noted a significant association between the failure of freeze-dried allografts used for ACL reconstruction and the time from procurement to implantation, suggesting that the shelf life of freeze-dried tissues is limited. Another study59 found that the ultimate strength of cancellous bone was reduced by 19% and stiffness by 20% in rehydrated lypophilized grafts, suggesting that the mechanical properties of lypophilized BPTB grafts may be inferior to those of fresh-frozen allografts.",

Despite recent highly publicized occurrences of infection from allografts, however, the current risk of an allograft infection appears to be much less than the risk of infection surrounding the surgical procedure itself.5, 9 Most of these incidents involved questionable practices, violations of FDA regulations, and even alleged illegal activities by recovery agents.13, 15, 24 According to a report from the AATB covering data from 2003 and 2004, of 192 reports of suspected allograft-related infections, 42% involved soft-tissue grafts and 37% involved bone grafts, with an overall incidence of 0.014%; 59% involved orthopedic sports medicine procedures.9 The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) recommends that surgeons choose tissue provided by an AATB-member tissue bank and that they be familiar with the different sterilization processes used for allografts.60, 61 With appropriate donor screening, improved donor testing, including NAT, and adherence to AATB standards, the risk of disease transmission or infections can be eliminated or substantially decreased.",
