The early, non-invasive diagnosis of FIP is difficult.",

They found, as has been confirmed with PCR testing, that the FIP-associated coronavirus is present in a high percentage of cats without FIP. Identification of the antibody or antigen in a cat does not always correlate with disease. The disease most likely is a combination the virus, either genetically modified or the street virus, reacting in a cat with the appropriate immunologic or innate immunity interaction to result in disease. In other words, like other conditions in the cat, it requires the cat's immunity and virus interaction to become pathogenic. The virus without an imbalanced immunological reaction in the cat is likely to reside without any pathogenic results.",

In my opinion, the FIP antibody titer needs to be dropped from our diagnostic profiling in the cat. The results of FIP testing are commonly confusing. Thus, more and more veterinarians are ignoring these results, as should be. If you need a confirmed diagnosis of FIP, a biopsy of lesions or necropsy with demonstration of the coronavirus antigen in inflamed tissue is required. This will be the norm for some time to come. A new, more effective approach will be required to improve upon this reliable yet inconvenient means of diagnosis of FIP disease. (LDM)",
