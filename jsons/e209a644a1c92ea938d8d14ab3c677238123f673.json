            "text": "Ever since its establishment in 1911, The University of Hong Kong has relied on government funding. The Asian financial crisis caused serious government budget deficits and funding for higher education was sharply reduced. Both the government and the university realized that it was crucial to seek external private support. Within the university, many realized that reliance on the government meant survival but not growth. Philanthropists, in particular Li Ka-shing, became the target of fundraisers. In 2005, he made a very generous gift of HK$1 billion to the university; in turn, the university named the medical faculty after him. This stirred up a storm as critics accused the university of selling off its \"ancestral shrine.\" This controversy subverted the original intent of the gift, but despite this, the philanthropist's support of the university continued. Today, the university has forged an East-West Alliance consisting of leading global institutions that had benefited from Li's generosity, and high-level exchanges are conducted on this platform.",

For many, it marked the search for a new home overseas, with roughly 20% of the population leaving before the handover. But for those who remained, the last decade of British rule turned into a period of excitement and great prosperity. The transitional period was a testing time for the middle class, many of whom chose to migrate, as well as for the colonial business establishment. Thus, Jardine Matheson, which had set up its headquarters in Hong Kong in 1842 with the birth of the British colony, shifted its domicile to Bermuda in 1984 in a striking demonstration of its lack of confidence in the colony's future under Chinese sovereignty. Similarly, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation set up a London-headquartered holding company, HSBC Holdings, in 1991. Its Hong Kong operations thus became a subsidiary of the London holding company before the colony returned to Chinese rule.",

Pao and Li Ka-shing were beginning to take over old British hongs. In 1979, Li acquired Hutchison Whampoa, a British firm with roots extending back to the nineteenth century. Pao in the 1980s obtained control of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Wharf and Godown Co. Ltd. And, in 1985, he also took over control of Wheelock Marden, another old British company established in the mid-nineteenth century. The development of Chinese entrepreneurs had previously been inhibited because financing was difficult to obtain and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, established in 1914, was reluctant to allow the listing of new local companies, a situation which eventually led to a proliferation of locally controlled stock exchanges, giving Hong Kong the appearance of a town in the wild west where anything goes. It wasn't until the mid-1980s that legislation was adopted to set up a unified exchange.",

            "text": "Britain committed itself to maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability during the transition years and China pledged to cooperate. The result was an economic boom. This was characterized by a rise in conspicuous consumption, symbolized by the opening of Club Volvo in 1986, which claimed to be the \"biggest Japanese-style nightclub in the world.\" China, as promised, gave its cooperation to maintaining the colony's prosperity. Two Chinese officials took part in the ribbon-cutting to launch the gaudy nightclub: Li Chuwen (\u674e\u5132\u6587), vice director of the New China News Agency, China's unofficial representative body in Hong Kong, and Wang Guangying (\u738b\u5149\u82f1), chairman of China's Everbright Group and vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In addition to its 1,000 \"hostesses,\" Club Volvo also attracted customers by using an electric Rolls-Royce to escort them into the 1.6-acre club from the front entrance. 1 One sign of economic growth was the increase in the number of listed companies, which quadrupled from 1984, when the Joint Declaration was signed, to 486,997 in 1997. Even Club Volvo tried, but failed, to get a listing. Property prices went up and up, reaching stratospheric heights, as did the stock market. Both were at all-time highs by 1997. Per capita GDP stood at US$27,330 (HK$213,174) in 1997, higher than that in Britain (US$24,803), the colonial power. 2 The festivities on June 30, 1997 lasted well into the next day when the British crown colony was transformed into a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. However, by sheer coincidence, on July 2, Thailand floated its currency, the baht, as it was unable to support its peg to the US dollar. 3 With that, the Asian financial crisis was launched, with a wave of currency devaluations in Southeast Asia and Japan, causing a slump in stock markets and a drop in other asset values. Hong Kong was able to maintain its own peg to the US dollar despite speculative attacks by billionaire financier George Soros and others, with the government risking its reserves to prop up the stock market to defend the currency. Soros subsequently praised Hong Kong for having thwarted him successfully. 4",

First, despite the recent signs of economic recovery, deflation over the past 50 months has accumulated to 13%, and there is no indication that it will disappear in the short term. Confidence in local investment and consumption has suffered. For some, incomes have continued to drop. Second, people's wealth has shrunk with declining asset values, with some facing the hardship of negative equity. These distressing consequences have become more obvious in recent years. Third, economic contraction and restructuring have led to changes in the employment structure and resulted in increasing unemployment, a prime concern of the community. Despite a slight improvement in recent months, unemployment remains far too high. Lastly, the substantial reduction in government revenue and rising public expenditure have resulted in increasing fiscal deficits in the past few years. As a result, our fiscal reserves have been sharply reduced. This is beginning to affect our credit ratings. If not dealt with properly, the stability of our financial system could be jeopardized.\" 7",

It provides a level playing field for all, and the human resources required for further economic development. Our education system must cater for Hong Kong's needs, contribute to the country, and adopt an international outlook.

Government support for education did continue to increase, despite the adverse impact the economic recession was having on its revenues. Thus, in 2000, Chief Executive Tung pledged in his policy address that Hong Kong would greatly increase the number of senior secondary school graduates who pursue tertiary education. \"In developed countries and some major cities in Asia, up to 60% of senior secondary school graduates pursue tertiary education,\" the Chief Executive said. \"For Hong Kong, however, the rate is just about half that, not only are we lagging far behind, but we are failing to meet the needs of a knowledgebased economy. It is imperative that we catch up. Our objective is that within ten years, 60% of our senior secondary school leavers will receive tertiary education.\" 12 The following year, when he delivered the 2001 policy address, Chief Executive Tung pledged: \"Regardless of Hong Kong's economic situation, you can rest assured that in the next five to ten years spending on education will continue to increase year after year. Our tertiary, secondary and primary education will become better and better, and the trend for lifelong learning will become even stronger.\" 13 By his fifth year in office, total government expenditure on education was $48.72 billion, which was 3.7% of GDP or 21% of total government expenditure. 14 However, notwithstanding the overall increased expenditure for education, funds for higher education were, in fact, being trimmed. This was in part due to the predecessor colonial government, which decided that tertiary education was entering a \"consolidation phase\" and some reduction was possible without affecting the quality of education. In December 1996, when plans were laid for the 1998-2001 triennium, the decision was made to freeze student numbers in the eight tertiary institutions within the ambit of the University Grants Committee. Since fund allocations were tied to student numbers, it meant, in effect, a ceiling on funding. \"We agree with the UGC's recommendation that the number of first-year, first-degree places should remain constant at 14,500 full-time-equivalent, i.e. some 18% of the 17-20 age group,\" the Education and Manpower Branch said in a paper submitted to the Legislative Council Panel on Education. 15 Moreover, the government decided on a reduction in student unit cost \"of slightly more than 3% per annum, i.e. a total of 10% reduction in unit cost by the end of the 1998-2001 triennium without detriment to quality.\" 16 Thus, a 10% reduction over three years had to be absorbed by the universities.

The letter was written in response to an invitation from the LegCo Panel on Education seeking a response to the government's plan to cut funding by an average of 10%. President Ng began by declaring: \"We fully understand and recognize that in the present economic situation, the tertiary institutions will be affected by the Government's desire to reduce the budget deficit. Our primary concern, however, relates to the impact of the severity of the cuts that are likely to be imposed in a very short period of time.\" He then set forth the grievances of the eight tertiary institutions involved: 17 \"The overall cuts for 2004-05 will in fact be much greater than the recently announced 10% reduction in the UGC Block Grant, which will not include the 3% salary reduction that the Government has decided to introduce,\" the letter said. \"The tertiary institutions may therefore in a single year face a reduction of at least 13%. It is also not clear whether the proposed 10% cut will incorporate the reduction that will result from the loss of student places following the withdrawal of Government funding support for most TPG [taught post-graduate] and sub-degree programmes and the plans to reduce significantly the FYFD [first year, first degree] numbers of some institutions.

We are particularly dismayed by the fact that only two years ago in his 2001 Policy Address, the Chief Executive affirmed that 'despite the pressure of economic downturn on public finances, our resolve to invest in education is unshaken. Regardless of Hong Kong's economic situation, you can rest assured that in the next five to ten years spending on education will continue to increase year after year'. \"At present, the Government spends a relatively low proportion of GDP on education as a whole in terms of Hong Kong's level of economic development and provides restricted access to higher education. Hong Kong will never achieve its goal of becoming a worldclass international city if it continues to reduce investment in education since, in the final analysis, it is educated people who are our greatest asset. Over the last twenty years, the higher education sector in particular has made a significant and important contribution to Hong Kong's development and stability. One of the key features of our society that distinguishes it from others in Asia is that we possess a system of higher education that is of international standard. Nevertheless, it is becoming clear that the scale of the existing and planned cutbacks, through a wide variety of means, will result in approximately 50% reduction of the spending on the sector over a period of less than a decade if indeed there is a further deep cut in the forthcoming triennium.",

Among its final recommendations for higher education in 2002, the UGC urged \"The Government to consider the increased use of matching grants and other incentives to generate additional momentum for private sector participation in supporting higher education.\" 21 This proposal was accepted by the government. The UGC also urged universities to set up institutional advancement offices to raise funds. The fact that the UGC had to ask universities to set up offices to raise funds showed just how unprepared some of them were for such activities. At the University of Hong Kong, however, there was already an existing institution, the Hong Kong University Foundation, established in 1995 by the then vice-chancellor, Professor Wang Gungwu, whose purpose was to raise funds from the private sector. As early as 1998, Wang Gungwu asked K.M. Cheng, a pro-vice-chancellor, to concentrate on fund-raising. \"He was very far sighted,\" Cheng said. 22 From then on, there was always someone at a very senior level whose job it was to develop relations with the private sector with the aim of raising funds ( Fig. 15.4) .",

The review was completed in early 2003 and Niland, its convenor, wrote in a covering letter when the overall report was issued: \"HKU is a fine institution, and from our discussions with stakeholders we firmly believe that its strategic intent to be counted among the top twenty-five universities in the world is achievable if pursued with purpose. We hope that our report will contribute to this purpose.\" 27 The report itself covered a wide scope on issues facing the university. Its section on resources and resourcing had this to say: \"There are worldclass universities and there are, regrettably, impoverished universities in the world; we know of no truly great university that is also impoverished. The resources and resourcing do matter-they matter profoundly. Yet what government in the world seriously contemplates funding education, or for that matter health care and social welfare provisions, to the ideal level needed? There are inevitably strong competing demands for limited public resources overall, and within the education sector pressures for the education budget will very likely push more resources to the nursery, primary and secondary sectors. And this phenomenon of intra-sector rebalancing in a general context of funding shortfalls is by no means unique to Hong Kong. Against this background, and in the interest of higher education at large, HKU must work with individual donors and companies to secure private sources of funding. Like other international universities of high standing, HKU will also need to engage actively in broad-based philanthropic fund raising activities to boost its income, particularly for student scholarships and support of research. For Hong Kong to become a knowledge based economy, industries and the corporate sector must be encouraged through effective and carefully designed partnerships to invest in the discovery and transmission of knowledge. An environment of assurance for business and industrial partners and individual benefactors that the resources they channel to the University will be handled professionally and effectively, and with probity, is absolutely critical.\"",

We asked the UGC if they could buy us out, then you don't have to give us money any more.\" 29 Part of his thinking was to triple fees, to $150,000. \"The middle class can easily afford it,\" he said. Professor Cheng approached the entrepreneur and philanthropist Li Ka-shing, who was known for his interest in education and who, in 1980, had set up the Li Ka Shing Foundation as his vehicle for charitable contributions. \"Li Ka-shing agreed to donate a billion,\" Cheng said. However, when Cheng left office abruptly in September 2000 in the aftermath of the Robert Chung scandal where infringement of academic freedom was alleged, the matter was put in abeyance while a global hunt for a successor was mounted. In the interim, Ian Davies, one of the founding members of the Faculty of Dentistry in 1983, served as vice-chancellor. Davies did not pursue the privatization idea. However, the possibility of a $1 billion donation was still in the air within the University. In fact, according to Cheng, after he announced his resignation, he received a phone call from Li who told the departing vice-chancellor that he would not make the donation to the University for the time being since he didn't know who his successor would be. 30 But within the university a very large donation from Hong Kong's richest man was still seen as very much a live possibility.",

His wife, Winnie, had a relative named Bill Chan, a businessman trained as a doctor, who was a close friend and golfing buddy of the tycoon. With his help, S.K. managed to make an appointment to see Li Ka-shing. Without informing the vice-chancellor or, indeed, anyone else within the University, S.K. went boldly to Li Ka-shing's office on August 12, 2003 for a chat, during which he made a 15-minute power-point presentation. \"I presented a vision,\" S.K. said. \"I presented the whole thing, and then I went away. I just talked to Mr. Li about the medical school, what we wanted to do, what we have done, how good we are and where we want to go. Then I went away.\" 35 One person present on that occasion was K.S. Lo, former chairman of the Hospital Authority. Recalling the event more than 13 years later, he said, \"Professor S.K. Lam talked about the HKU medical school's achievements, including some plans on the Human Genome projects.\" 36 In his power-point presentation, S.K. began with Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of modern China, who graduated from the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese in 1892, part of the first graduating class of just two. Dr. Sun led the movement to overthrow China's last imperial dynasty, which resulted in the establishment of the Republic of China in 1912, coinciding with the opening of the University of Hong Kong. The Sun quotation reads: \"World progress is like a tidal wave. Those who ride it will prosper, and those who oppose it will perish.\" 37 S.K. then went on to set the scene: Hong Kong, China and Asia. The world, he said, is entering the period of globalization. He emphasized the developed world's technology and the developing world's potential, pointing out that China had grown at 10% a year for 20 years. Within 10 years, he said, Hong Kong will be fully integrated into the mainland, especially the Pearl River Delta. The development of biomedical technology, he said, was the Hong Kong Government's long-term goal. Hong Kong, he declared, was entering the knowledge economy era. He then quoted Li Ka-shing to himself, describing knowledge as requiring far-sighted vision coupled with the profound investigation of all things.",

In fact, the teaching force of the world's top ten medical schools (in research output) has grown by an average of 4% to 5% a year for many years.

Each teaches about 750 medical students on a 5-year curriculum; interestingly, the top ten medical schools have a similar teaching load of between 460 and 880.\" Thus, the world's best medical schools have more than ten times the full-time teachers as Hong Kong medical faculties, but teach more or less the same number of students.

The meeting was held in Mr. Li's office on February 22, 2005. The Vice-Chancellor, Professor Lap-chee Tsui, and the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, Professor S.K. Lam, were also present. It stands to reason that the vice-chancellor would be invited to a meeting to discuss the University's campus development plans but it was odd that the dean of the medical faculty should have been present if the idea was solely to discuss the new campus, since the medical faculty is located on Sassoon Road and not involved in the western development project. Dean Lam's presence, it seems clear, resulted from a decision by Li Ka-shing himself and probably reflected the influence of the presentation he had made on the work of the faculty 18 months previously. Jack So insists that he merely set up the meeting and exchanged pleasantries and was not involved in discussion of any serious issues. 43 However, the Li Ka Shing Foundation says that the meeting was requested by Jack So \"to discuss HKU's campus development plans\" and \"VC Tsui and Dean Lam also joined the meeting.\" The foundation referred to the three men as forming a \"delegation.\" 44 According to the foundation, \"Dean Lam spoke about the Faculty of Medicine's achievements and future development plans, and outlined the University's need for funding support.\" As for the vice-chancellor, he \"added that a significant gift at this juncture would kick-start a culture of giving and enlarge the pool of support for local universities.\"",

Medical research and education, particularly at HKU, was one of Hong Kong's unique strengths, and Mr. Li firmly believed that the development and accumulation of intellectual capital in cutting-edge industries such as the life sciences was a vital foundation for economic growth. He was confident that a major donation to HKU would help realize the Faculty of Medicine's innovative and transformative initiatives and bring fruitful and meaningful opportunities to Hong Kong and to the world.\"",

Lam vividly recalls that the philanthropist held up ten fingers and said, \"10 yi,\" (using the Chinese word for 100 million) meaning a billion dollars. Mr. Li had evidently been thinking deeply about what he could do to help Hong Kong face increasingly tough competition and had decided that the best thing to do was to help the University, in particular, to assist the medical faculty to realize its dreams and, in this way, help the University, Hong Kong and the world. As to how the idea of naming the Faculty of Medicine after the philanthropist came about, the foundation's account had this to say: \"The delegation was encouraged and suggested the naming of the Faculty of Medicine.\" That is to say, the idea was proposed then and there by a member of the delegation-Jack So, Lap-chee Tsui or S.K. Lam. Former Vice-Chancellor Tsui, who acknowledges his memory is hazy on some details, said, \"It wasn't me who came up with the idea, and when the proposal was made on the naming, I said I had to consult the Council.\" 45 S.K. Lam, asked if he had suggested naming the faculty after its benefactor, denied it vociferously: \"It's not my idea. I absolutely deny this. I had no power, even if I liked it.\" He said the naming \"was sort of a mutual understanding and the University made the decision. The faculty has no power.\"",

And, in the end, it was the University Council that made the decision to name the Faculty of Medicine after its benefactor, Li Ka-shing. Yet, Dean Lam's 2003 visit to Mr. Li and the pitch he made then for the faculty was clearly an attempt to win the goodwill of Mr. Li if he one day decided to make a donation to the University. Interestingly, Professor S.P. Chow, former Faculty Board chairman, recalls a particular conversation that he had with S.K. Lam. \"I remember him asking me once,\" Professor Chow said, \"if someone gave us a big sum of money, do you think we can name the faculty after him?\" 46 In any event, despite the vice-chancellor's desire for funds for the centennial campus, Mr. Li made it clear at that crucial meeting and in subsequent statements that one of his key interests was to fund the medical faculty and, as the Li Ka Shing Foundation said, he hoped that a major donation to the university would \"help realize the Faculty of Medicine's innovative and transformative initiatives.\" Thus, it was the donor's desire that a major chunk of the money should go to the faculty. Sooner or later, the University would be faced with the decision of how to respond to such a huge gift. Naming the faculty after the donor would have been a natural option for it to consider, since the faculty was the major beneficiary. There were few other options. After all, the main building at the faculty had already been named. So, regardless of who came up with the idea on February 22, 2005, the naming option would have surfaced in due course and, in all likelihood, adopted.",

Tsui said he did not think so. \"People who donate to the university don't do so because we are poor,\" he said, \"but because they want to help us to help society.\" Giving to the university is not disaster relief, he said.

The most dramatic thing the protesters did-and the most hurtful-was to hold a memorial service on the street outside the medical faculty on New Year's Day when the naming came into effect to mourn the \"death\" of the old Faculty of Medicine. 56 The university was under siege and responded by setting up a war room where its members met every morning to decide whether responses should be made to allegations and news reports. The university's strategy was to contain the incident as much as possible rather than to stir things up. Also, senior management, remembering how allegations of suppression of academic freedom had resulted in Patrick Cheng's resignation, decided to protect Lap-chee, keeping him from the front lines.

It attempted to set the record straight by explaining that the naming was not equivalent to \"selling\" the faculty, and that the university, not its benefactor, would continue to be in charge of the medical school. It provided assurances that the tycoon's companies would not benefit financially from the commercialization of any medical research. It also provided names, dates and figures showing how medical colleges overseas had also been named for benefactors. And it saw to it that doctors who supported the move appeared on media programs and that their letters, too, appeared in the press. The general strategy was to fight the emotional firestorm with calmness and rationality rather than being combative.",

Hong Kong's changing economic structure may also have been a factor. In the past, Mr. Li, nicknamed \"Superman\", was admired as a role model, with young people thinking that if he could lift himself by his own bootstraps, they could do the same. But, by the early years of the twenty-first century, with a widening gap between rich and poor, there was an increasing sense that the extremely wealthy inhabited a world different from the rest of society. Despite the passage of more than a decade, feelings remain strong among some alumnivery much including those who were not vocal opponents at the time-many of whom still harbor a sense of disappointment with the name change and a feeling of alienation. Now, more than a dozen years after the incident, what is the standing of the faculty in the eyes of young people? Judging from the graduating secondary class each year, it seems that medicine continues to be highly attractive as a career and, of the two medical schools in Hong Kong, admission to the one at the University of Hong Kong is still highly prized. In 2015, 10 years after the naming saga, 11 students in Hong Kong had a perfect score in the secondary school examination. Of these, eight opted to study medicine. And of the eight, seven joined the University of Hong Kong's Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine. 62 This suggests that the naming of the faculty has not had a deterring effect on young people seeking to pursue a career in medicine.",

As for the significance to Hong Kong, Ms. Chau said that every time Mr. Li gives a grant to an overseas institution, he voices the hope that they will allow qualified Hong Kong researchers to participate in relevant work. This way, she said, these grants provide leverage to researchers in Hong Kong's two medical schools to have exchanges with the best medical researchers in the world. 65 S.K. Lam, knowing that Mr. Li wanted to support the medical faculty, reveled in his victory. At the time the US$128 million donation was the second largest in the world to a medical school, exceeded only by a US$200 million donation to the UCLA medical school in 2002. That gift resulted in the naming of the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles. S.K. had worked mightily not to enrich himself but to enable the faculty to perform at a higher level. Yet, even so, his triumph was short-lived. In early 2007, he submitted his resignation, 17 months before the expiration of his term, amid reports that the university was conducting an investigation into the procedures for billing of private patients. 66 A year later, he was charged with fraud, misconduct in public office and theft involving over HK$4 million between June 2003 and January 2007. 67 This came as a shock to many of his colleagues, who had known him as a man who volunteered his medical services in northern Guangdong between 1994 and 1999 to take care of patients without financial reward. His team then performed a record 2,500 procedures on villagers with gastrointestinal problems. He instigated groundbreaking research on stomach cancer in the region. 68 His trial in Hong Kong ended in 2009 when the former dean pleaded guilty to charges of misconduct in public office. He admitted to pocketing about HK$4 million in university donations.",
