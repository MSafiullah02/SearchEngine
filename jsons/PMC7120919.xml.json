This phenomenon is further exacerbated by rapid infusion of unwarmed crystalloid fluid during initial resuscitation. This condition impairs coagulation factor activity and platelet function, such as their ability to produce thromboxane, and must be rapidly reversed [4]. Dilutional coagulopathy follows large crystalloid and colloid fluid resuscitation, further promoting ongoing bleeding. Early plasma therapy and platelets have been associated with a reduction in hemorrhage-related mortality [5, 6].",

Pre-emptive strategies have been shown to actually reduce coagulopathy and the number of overall transfusions required to treat the patient [8, 9]. However, challenges to implementation include time limitations of laboratory-guided component therapy since the results of the tests are not immediate. Another difficulty is that once it has been determined that the patient should receive plasma, an additional 30\u201345 min is required to thaw and deliver the products [5]. As such, hospitals should have in place a thawed plasma program, keeping adequate numbers of \u201cuniversal\u201d and type-specific thawed plasma available for immediate release. Plasma thawing protocols exist to avoid this issue and will be discussed in later sections. In acutely bleeding patients, massive transfusion protocols should be activated in order to efficaciously restore blood volume and hemostasis and thawed plasma is critical to their success [5, 10]. Blood products can always be sent back should the clinical setting change, but you can\u2019t speed up delivery and preparation of products when you need them.",

Plasma should be available in either thawed form (5 day shelf-life once thawed) or liquid form (never frozen, absolute shelf-life of 21\u201326 days). A type and screen should be drawn as soon as possible to allow for the transition from universal products to type-specific ones. The efficacy of an MTP also lies in its early implementation as well as identification of patients who would benefit from such an intervention. Criteria for activation include laboratory values, anatomic injuries, and mechanism of injury. Although individual laboratory values (hemoglobin, INR, hematocrit, and pH) have been shown to correlate with massive transfusion requirements, MTP activation should never be delayed on the basis of lab results, which can take up to 45 min to return. The urgency in treating severely injured patients requires early and immediate initiation of MTP based on clinical assessment for rapid delivery of blood products to the bedside. Several scoring systems have been developed tofacilitate rapid identification of patients requiring MTP activation based on physical and laboratory results (Table 13.1). Several authors have demonstrated that the transfusion of uncross-matched RBCs is an independent predictor of substantial hemorrhage and the transfusion of multiple units of RBC, plasma, and platelets [12, 13]. As such, when one is requesting uncross-matched product for transfusion, the institution\u2019s MTP should be activated.\n",

One reason is that the coagulopathy is addressed after a time lapse since the original laboratory values were obtained. Other reasons for the suboptimal results of this method are due to the ratios of each blood component product infused. Specifically, evidence exists that demonstrates that large volume of crystalloid fluids is associated with increased hemorrhage and lower survival rates [15]. It has been hypothesized that this effect is due to insufficient replenishing of hemostasis factors, and the complex coagulopathy of dilution, consumption of factors, and fibrinolysis is not adequately addressed.

It also involves more permissive hypertension, and acting preemptively on the hypovolemic, hemorrhaging patient. DCR is also supported by findings from the military, which demonstrated improvement in outcomes in severely bleeding patients who were transfused in ratios of products similar to whole blood. A large amount of retrospective civilian trauma data has demonstrated that an RBC to plasma ratio between 3:2 and 1:1 is associated with increased survival [5]. Fox et al. found that patients undergoing vascular surgery with DCR had improved revascularization and graft patency.

It is, however, important to consider the underlying pathology responsible for exsanguination, such as in obstetric patients, as well as related comorbidities, such as uremia, pharmacologic anticoagulation, in assessing for need of blood products [5]. For instance, K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 et al.\u2019s review of resuscitation in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding found that 1:1:1 ratios of RBCs, FFPs, and platelets reduced dilutional coagulopathy, similarly to trauma patients. Patients undergoing open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair are also vulnerable to coagulopathy due to systemic heparinization, hypothermia, and left-heart bypass with a centrifugal pump [17]. As well, several authors have noted its benefit in the vascular population [16, 18, 19]. Mell evaluated 168 patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm who had massive hemorrhage in the perioperative period. Their findings showed reduced 30-day mortality in patients who were transfused 1:1 RBC to plasma ratios. These patients also experienced lower rates of colonic ischemia. The value of this study is that the average age of patients was 73 years, much older than the average trauma patient, demonstrating applicability of MTPs in different patient age populations [19].",

Recent data suggests that liquid plasma may maintain superior coagulation profiles during storage (compared to thawed plasma) [42, 43].

Grosso et al. recount a case of collecting whole blood from hospital personnel donors in a US field surgical hospital in Kosovo. This whole blood was used to treat exsanguinating coagulopathy in an acutely bleeding patient. The advantage of whole blood is its ability to increase hemoglobin levels, similarly to red blood cells, and its ability to restore blood volumes, similarly to crystalloids [47]. Because of its physiological ratios of each blood component, it may hold an advantage over individual blood component transfusions, but more work is necessary to substantiate this idea.",

The most common cause of hemolytic reactions due to transfusion of an incorrect match is clerical error. Hemolytic reactions in blood transfusions occur because each individual carries antibodies against the blood group (A or B) that it does not express endogenously. Hence, when products containing anti-A or anti-B antibodies in plasma, such as plasma, are transfused to patients of A, B or both blood groups, the donor antibodies stage an attack on the patient\u2019s red blood cells. Allergic reactions are another common immune-mediated complication of transfusions. Severely anaphylactic reactions are more common after plasma compared to RBC transfusion [32].

            "text": "\nTRALI is defined as acute lung injury occurring within 6 h of transfusion with a blood product, with most commonly reported cases occurring due to FFP [50]. TRALI is the most common cause of death due to transfusion [32]. TRALI is characterized by respiratory insufficiency, not limited to but including tachypnea, cyanosis, dyspnea, and acute hypoxemia [50]. In patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, TRALI is further exacerbated by the presence of end-stage liver disease. Proposed mechanisms for this phenomenon have included antibody-mediated reactions, but these findings are not definitive and many are subject to selection bias due to no screening in the asymptomatic population [50]. Autopsies and animal models have suggested hyperactive PMN involvement, since mass infiltration was noted [50]. A two-event model has also been proposed, with the first event dictated by the clinical health of the patient and the second event by the quality (affected by storage, donor immunologic components) of the blood product [50]. The treatment of TRALI is aggressive respiratory support and ventilation in more severe cases, such as in critically ill patients [50]. Practices to reduce the risk of TRALI include prestorage leukoreduction as well as avoiding the use of old blood products, defined as older than 14 days for RBCs and older than 2 days for platelet concentrates. Another prevention strategy is using only male donors or donors who have never been pregnant due to look back studies showing fewer TRALI events in blood donations from those populations [51]. Eder et al. demonstrated that preferential distribution of plasma from male donors reduced the reported number of TRALI cases. However lethal these rare events are, it is critical to understand the risk\u2013benefit ratio in such cases. As noted earlier, current rates of TRALI are estimated at just over 4 cases per 1,000,000 units transfused [52].",

The exact mechanism of this effect has not yet been elucidated, but plasma components, WBCs, metabolic products from storage processes are thought to play a role. This effect may be responsible for the immunosuppressive effects of transfusions on severely ill patients. Transfusions can cause sensitization to HLA antigens, creating a unique problem in potential kidney transplant patients. Studies have demonstrated increased sensitization of patients on a kidney transplant waiting list after transfusion, rendering them unsuitable candidates for living donation. Their only remaining alternative once this has occurred is to wait for a cadaveric graft, which takes up to 4 times longer, and may never receive a transplant. Hence, non-life-sustaining transfusions should be avoided in potential kidney transplant recipients [23].",

Virus risks in the UK in plasma have been estimated at 1 in 8 million for HIV, 1 in 30 million for HCV, and 1 in 900,000 for HBV [32]. Since up to 50 % of adult donors are CMV carriers, there is a risk of transmission of this virus to patients, especially the immunosuppressed, transplant patients and neonates [32]. Compared to viral causes, bacterial, endotoxin and prion contamination rates are more rare [32]. In order to avoid this deleterious complication, virus-inactivated preparations of plasma exist, such as methylene blue and solvent-detergent treated products. While these options may offer increased viral protection, they have been associated with loss of clotting factors [32]. The most stringent testing protocols and sensitive tests may not ever eradicate the risk of infectious agent transmission as new pathogens of unknown methods of spread are constantly emerging and may not actively be screened for in its early emergence. In addition, long incubation period of pathogens before seroconversion of blood make it even harder to prevent [27]. Prion diseases transmitted by transfusion has been a concern in the UK, following the BSE epidemic. Unfortunately, no screening test for this condition has been established, and the occurrence of prion diseases in blood products in the UK is largely unknown. In order to avoid transfusions with prion disease, plasma has been imported from the USA since 2002 for pediatric transfusions [32].",

            "text": "Another concerning complication is the loss of efficacy in stored blood, and the adverse effects it causes. These consequences of the storage process are known as a storage lesion. With current technology, the shelf life of red blood cells cannot be extended further than its physiological shelf life of 120 days, and 35 and 42 days is the limit of viability in whole blood and adenine-saline preservation, respectively [27]. Even this length of shelf-life results in counterproductive transfusions. Specifically, RBC products older than 2 weeks have been shown to not improve oxygen uptake in septic patients. In fact, RBCs of that age have been associated with higher mortality, increased adverse events, extended hospital stay, and electrolyte imbalances. This reduction in efficacy may be due to decreased ability of the older RBCs to unload oxygen [27]. Another proposed mechanism is that since stored RBCs have depleted nitric oxide, this may have a vasoconstrictive effect, leading to thrombosis and the observed increases in venous and arterial thrombotic events in patients with increased RBC and platelet transfusions [49]. The question is how realistic it is to maintain strict storage age in a finite and scarce resource such as blood. A double-blind, prospective randomized pilot study demonstrated that controlling the storage age of RBCs in transfusion compared to the current standard of care is feasible and results in decreased exposure to older blood [55]. More evidence is needed to determine precisely the cut-off age of RBCs in their efficacy and availability. In stored platelets, it has been estimated that the recovery rate of 5-day-old platelets is about 50 %, with many nonviable platelets being sequestered into the spleen [38]. For these reasons, there is some concern that platelet counts performed immediately after transfusion do not provide an accurate picture of platelet function [38].",

Intravascular volume, and more specifically, plasma volume increases proportionately more than red cell volume, creating a \u201cphysiologic anemia of pregnancy\u201d [61]. Fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and factors VII, VIII, IX, X, XII are synthesized more frequently while levels of factors XI and XIII and platelets decrease [45]. Levels of factor II decrease, yet interestingly, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) remain unaffected [61].

Vincent et al.\u2019s multicenter prospective observational study of 1136 patients demonstrated that ICU patients frequently received transfusions, with a transfusion rate of 37 % during their stay. The patients who received transfusions also experienced a higher mortality rate, prolonged hospital stay, and decreased organ function [28]. There is also evidence suggestive of increased transfusions in patients with hemoglobin levels higher than the generally accepted trigger value of 8 g/dL. Specifically, Vincent et al.

Furthermore, CCTs, which are riddled with delays from time to arrival in the laboratory and duration of testing, end up reflecting the coagulation state of the patient after 30\u201345 min of interventions and resuscitation [63]. Since CCT only examines plasma factors, the integral role of platelets and their function is ignored. In addition, the CCT assesses only the extrinsic pathway, intrinsic pathway, and platelet count, painting an incomplete picture of the pathologies of clotting in the severely exsanguinating patient. These deficiencies are addressed by thrombelastography (TEG), a test that creates a dynamic, graphical representation of the coagulation characteristics of a blood sample from initial clot formation to fibrinolysis.

Factor deficiency or severe hemodilution can prolong reaction time or ACT. Next, k-time represents the time needed to reach 20-mm clot strength, and has a normal range of 1\u20132 min. The \u2212angle, normally between 66 and 82\u00b0, represents the rate of clot formation. In platelet deficiency or hypofibrinogenemia, where one of the two key components of clots is missing, the k-time is increased and the \u2212angle is decreased. Oshita et al.\u2019s linear regression analysis of 36 samples from healthy individuals reported that MA and k-time were linearly related to platelet count [65]. The maximal amplitude (MA) of the tracing represents platelet contribution to clot strength (normal range 54\u201372 mm). It is decreased in states of platelet dysfunction and hypofibrinogenemia. The G-value represents overall clot strength, including platelet function as well as enzymatic, and is decreased in hypocoagulable states (normal 5.3\u201312 K dynes/cm2). The LY30 is the percent of amplitude reduction at 30 min after the MA, and is elevated in hyperfibrinolytic states (normal range 0.0\u20137.5 %) [64].\n",

Table 13.1 is an example of TEG-guided protocol with such an aim. Platelet dysfunction in cardiopulmonary bypass patients has been attributed to microvascular bleeding, and TEG has been used in the setting of cardiac surgery as a predictor of worsening patient outcomes due to this mechanism [17]. Solomon et al. demonstrated that fibrinogen clot elasticity assessed by TEG correlated to fibrinogen concentration in cardiopulmonary bypass patients [67]. TEG has been found to predict the risk of postoperative bleeding, and has been used to direct desmopressin therapy and FFP transfusion requirement in cardiopulmonary bypass patients [17].",

Unlike other surgeries, liver surgery poses the additional problem of increased risk of coagulation factor deficiencies due to hepatic dysfunction and lack of synthesis. TEG-guided transfusion algorithms in this area have been shown to reduce the transfusion requirements in such patients [17]. However, Ogawa et al.\u2019s prospective observational study of 26 patients undergoing cardiac surgery did not find a significant correlation between TEG measures and volume of intraoperative and total transfusions [66]. Despite these findings, Ronald et al.\u2019s literature search and appraisal of 170 studies on the topic found otherwise [68]. They investigated thromboelastography in cardiac surgery patients and found fourteen studies that provided the best evidence. Their synthesis concluded that TEG can guide transfusion therapy algorithms and result in decreased blood component requirements. In orthopedic surgery patients, TEG was used in a prospective study to identify disturbed fibrin polymerization as a pathological mechanism in dilutional coagulopathy, and to rescue this state with fibrinogen administration [69].",

Various mechanisms affect coagulation cascades in these patients, and techniques from the standard coagulation tests to TEG are currently available. These have shown mostly success in predicting the course of the patient and guiding therapy. The therapeutic options include various blood product components, ranging from whole blood to concentrations of individual factors. Using physiological ratios of RBCs, plasma, and platelets have improved patient survival in the massively hemorrhaging patient. However, like all powerful therapy, they are associated with adverse effects. Preventative options such as decreasing storage lengths and screening for infectious agents have drastically reduced these risks. Lastly, administering these products in a rapid and directed fashion would not be feasible without in-house triage and massive transfusion protocols. These algorithms include steps that must be taken to smooth out logistics of urgent transfusions, such as anticipating adequate thawing times of fresh frozen plasma and collaborating with blood banks to crosscheck appropriateness of each order.",
