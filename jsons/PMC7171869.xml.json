In endemic areas, the percentage of subclinical infections is much more frequent than patent disease [4]. Despite the absence of clinical signs, subclinical dogs can serve as a source of infection for phlebotomine vectors [5]. Thus, apart from the confirmation of clinical suspicion in a single patient, the confirmation of Leishmania infection in dogs without clinical signs should be attempted to promote their monitoring through follow-up [6, 7].",

            "text": "The definitive diagnosis of CanL is complex and should integrate anamnesis, clinical, haematological and biochemical findings, as well as the detection of the parasite and/or the immune response developed by the host [8]. The commonly used laboratory techniques for the diagnosis include the direct detection of Leishmania DNA by molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the indirect detection of antibodies against the parasite such as immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [9]. The late appearance of specific antibodies along with the visceral tropism of the parasites makes sampling, as well as owner compliance, challenging as invasive collection of material biopsies, such as bone marrow, needs to be frequently repeated. Therefore, a diagnostic test using biological samples collected by minimal or non-invasive approaches is simpler to perform, better tolerated by animals and by far more acceptable to dog owners. The use of conjunctiva swabs as samples, coupled with a sensitive and specific PCR, has shown encouraging results for diagnosis, treatment follow-up and/or for assessing Leishmania exposure in dogs [10, 11]. Peripheral blood sampling allows the concomitant serological and molecular diagnosis of CanL. The main disadvantage of this biological sample is the inconsistency of parasitaemia over the course of infection, especially in subclinical animals, and therefore molecular tests applied on blood samples are mostly used as a complement of serological results [9].",

In endemic areas of leishmaniosis caused by L. infantum, the detection of these anti-sand fly salivary antibodies has proven to be a useful epidemiological biomarker for monitoring exposure of hosts to vectors and it might be used to estimate the risk for Leishmania infection. Phlebotomus perniciosus-specific salivary recombinant proteins have been produced, to overcome difficulties in obtaining appropriate amounts of whole salivary gland homogenates (SGH), especially in large scale epidemiological studies [13]. The evaluation of different recombinant antigens of P. perniciosus revealed yellow-related protein (rSP03B) and/or apyrase (rSP01) as the most promising candidates to replace SGH in the detection of P. perniciosus exposure in dogs [14\u201316] and other mammalian hosts [17].",

The cumulative incidence and relative risk (RR) factors for Leishmania infection (inferred by ELISA, IFAT, peripheral blood nPCR and conjunctival swab nPCR) were determined from a sample of dogs classified as not exposed (i.e. negative to all tests) at the beginning of the sand fly seasonal activity.

The Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test was used to compare the median levels of antibodies to Leishmania and P. perniciosus saliva between the beginning and end of the sand fly season. The agreement between the results of different tests performed to screen dogs for exposure to Leishmania and P. perniciosus saliva was estimated using Cohen\u2019s kappa (k) test (k < 0, disagreement; k = 0, poor agreement; k > 0\u20130.20, slight agreement; k of 0.20\u20130.40, fair agreement; k of > 0.40\u20130.60, moderate agreement; k > 0.60\u20130.80, substantial agreement; k > 0.80\u20131.00 excellent agreement; [28]) and McNemar\u2019s test used to test for significant differences between discordant results.

Thus, in the present study, we evaluated the molecular and serological performance of blood, a minimally invasive biological sample, to detect the presence of Leishmania antibodies or its DNA in sheltered dogs at the beginning and end of the sand fly activity period. Antibodies to Leishmania were detected in 26 (12.5%) and 29 (13.9%) sera by ELISA, and in 14 (6.7%) and in 20 (9.6%) sera by IFAT, at the beginning and the end of the sand fly season, respectively, reinforcing the endemicity of the parasitosis in Metropolitan region of Lisbon [15, 23]. The increased number of seropositive dogs detected by both techniques at the end of the study might reflect on one hand, an infection that was not detectable at the start of the study, due to the low production of antibodies at the beginning of Leishmania infection [35]; this hypothesis is highly probable as most of the sheltered dogs were previously stray living in deficient health and nutritional conditions, and representing, therefore, an easier target for phlebotomine sand fly biting and for infection. On the other hand, the increased number of seropositive dogs at the end of sand fly season might represent an infection that occurred in the kennel, as the seroconversion rate by ELISA and IFAT was 4.5% and 1.8%, respectively, based on incidence values. Both techniques have been shown to have a high sensitivity as they were able to detect canine antibodies to the parasite between one to five months after experimental infection of dogs with L. infantum [26]. Further, L. infantum vectors were collected in the same year of the study in the screened area [2], and thus dogs could have been bitten by infected sand flies. Despite the overall increase in the number of dogs considered seropositive at the end of the sand fly season, some animals that were positive at the beginning of the study seroreverted. Seroreversion based on different diagnostic techniques over time has already been reported among naturally infected dogs [36] which may reflect exposure to the parasite followed by its clearance [37].",

The presence of antibodies to Leishmania detected by ELISA was significantly higher in pure breed dogs in comparison to mongrels, corroborating that the latter seem to have developed a certain resistance to Leishmania infection [38]. More importantly, an association between ELISA positivity and clinical signs was observed, with dogs presenting clinical signs compatible with leishmaniosis having a RR 8.58 times higher to be seropositive by this technique than those without clinical manifestations, supporting its use to confirm a clinical suspicion. In fact, in a previous study on experimentally infected dogs, the association between clinical signs and seropositivity to this commercial ELISA was suggested as a predictive marker of the development of infection to disease [26].",

As in the year that the study was conducted, the sand fly activity in the Metropolitan region of Lisbon started in May and ended in October [2], it is not surprisingly the high overall levels of seropositivity to anti-sand fly saliva antigens at the beginning (86.1%) and at the end (95.2%) of sand fly season, confirming the CanL endemicity status for the region [24]. As antibodies to sand fly saliva decay after the end of the biting season [14], the detection of antibodies to P. perniciosus saliva in a high percentage of dogs at the beginning of the season was probably related to their re-exposure to sand flies following antigenic priming in the previous season [15]. On the other hand, and since antibodies against saliva rise during summer months when sand fly abundance is higher [14], the increased number of dogs seropositive to salivary antigens at the end of the sand fly season was probably related with the exposure to more sand fly bites, as a second peak of P. perniciosus activity in Portugal was observed in September [2].",

As the presence and abundance of sand fly species responsible for L. infantum transmission varies according to the location, and throughout the transmission season, the sole use of SGH to specifically measure exposure to P. perniciosus, the most abundant L. infantum vector in the Western Mediterranean, can be hampered; however, this cross-reactivity might be an advantage, as both Larroussius species are proven L. infantum vectors [3].",

As the antigenic response to phlebotomine sand fly saliva reflects sand fly bites, whether the sand fly is infected or not, while Leishmania infection only occurs if the vertebrate host after being inoculated with the parasite cannot clear it, the relationship between the dynamics of antibodies against sand fly saliva and a subsequent Leishmania infection can only be evaluated in longitudinal studies. In the present study, a significant positive (although low) correlation between OD values to the three salivary antigens and ELISA OD to L. infantum was found in both time intervals and between IFAT titres and OD values to salivary antigens at the beginning of the phlebotomine season, reinforcing their potential usefulness as biomarkers of L. infantum infection [15, 16, 46].",
