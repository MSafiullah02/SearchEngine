The condition is usually preceded by a viral infection o vaccination, and the presenting features include an acute encephalopathy with multifocal neurological signs and deficits [1], [2], [3], [4]. In the absence of specific biological markers the diagnosis of DEM is still based on the clinical and radiological features.",

Although disseminated encephalomyelitis usually has a monophasic course (ADEM), recurrent (RDEM) and multiphasic forms (MDEM) have been reported, raising diagnostic difficulties in distinguishing these cases from multiple sclerosis (MS). The diagnostic differentiation between DEM and MS is important for prognostic reasons and treatment decision. The purpose of this review is to summarize literature data on the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, pathogenesis and outcome of paediatric DEM. Particular attention on recurrent and multiphasic variants of DEM and its differences from MS are also provided.",

A recent study conducted in San Diego County, USA estimated the mean incidence of DEM as 0.4/100,000/year among persons less than 20 years of age living in that region [6]. Five percent of these patients had received a vaccination within 1 month prior to the DEM event, and 93% reported signs of infection in the preceding 21 days. In contrast with these findings, the number of reported paediatric DEM patients per year in a study conducted in Germany was very low, with only nine children with DEM per year and 44 new paediatric MS cases per year [11]. Despite the lack of clear worldwide studies on epidemiology and distribution of DEM, the reported geographical differences in incidence are important to be considered and could be influenced by environmental triggering factors [11].",

Rare cases have been described following organ transplantation [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. Post-infectious forms of DEM typically begin within 2\u201321 days after an infectious event. Different viral agents, including influenza virus [17], enterovirus, measles [18], [19], mumps [20], rubella [19], varicella-zoster, Epstein Barr virus [21], cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus [22], [23], Hepatitis A virus [24], and coxsackie virus [25] have been associated with DEM [26], [27]. Bacterial triggers include Mycoplasma pneumoniae\n[28], Borrelia burgdorferi\n[29], Leptospira, and beta-haemolytic Streptococcus [30], [31]. The only epidemiologically and pathologically proven association between vaccination and DEM is with the Semple form of the antirabies vaccine [3], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]. Other immunizations that have been temporally related to DEM include Hepatitis B, pertussis, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, pneumococcus, varicella, influenza, Japanese encephalitis, and polio [6], [8], [19], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]. Nevertheless, DEM associated with vaccines may be related to contamination with host animal myelin antigens from CNS culture tissue, as it was identified in certain viral strains of rabies (Semple) and Japanese B encephalitis vaccines [32], [40]. The development of modern formulations based on recombinant proteins has dramatically lowered the incidence of vaccine-related DEM [41].",

MRI is the most sensitive paraclinical test to show these abnormalities, which are most frequently identified on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences as patchy, heterogeneous and poorly marginated areas of increased signal intensity. Lesions are typically large, multiple, and asymmetric, involving the white matter of cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem and spinal cord [26], [46]. The deep gray matter of the thalami and basal ganglia are frequently involved in a typically symmetrical pattern [8], [47]. The white matter lesions in children tend to involve the subcortical and central white matter; nevertheless involvement of the periventricular white matter has been described in 30\u201360% of cases [7], [9], [26]. Lesions confined to the corpus callosum are less common. However, large demyelinating lesions of the adjacent white matter may extend into the corpus callosum and cross into the contralateral hemisphere. In a study of 31 children diagnosed with DEM, 90% had lesions in the supratentorial white matter, 29% in the corpus callosum, and 61% had gray matter involvement [9].",

The MRI pattern does not appear to correlate with any particular outcome or disability, as observed in a large paediatric cohort [8] since most lesions tend to resolve on follow-up imaging studies [50]. However, this classification may be useful when considering the differential diagnosis of DEM (see Section 8).",

Several studies have described relapsing episodes in paediatric cohorts with DEM, occurring at different rates: 1/18 (5.5%) [7]; 1/14 (7%) [59]; 8/84 (10%) [8]; 4/31 (13%) [9]; 7/46 (15%) [10]; 24/132 (18%) [60]; 7/35 (20%) [5]; 9/42 (21%) [6]; 5/21 (24%) [61]. The inter-study variability of the relapsing rates may be influenced by the different clinical definitions and neuroimaging diagnostic criteria for DEM and relapses used in these studies. In addition, the mean follow-up reported in some of these series varied from 18 months [9] to 6.6 years [8].",

However, the terms recurrent (RDEM) and multiphasic (MDEM) had already been well defined by Poser [71]. Recurrent DEM as an initial ADEM event followed by a new one, reproducing the original clinical syndrome, completely or in part [61], [72], [73]. Multiphasic DEM as an initial episode of ADEM followed by bouts of clinical syndromes different from the original one. The clinical concept of relapses of an acute condition like ADEM received support from reports of chronic relapsing experimental encephalomyelitis [46], [74].",

But although these relapsing cases might have a final diagnosis of MS, 15 of the 24 ADEM patients with a second event were polysymptomatic, and five of them had changes in mental state, suggesting that these five cases were more probably instances of multiphasic DEM. Additionally, several follow-up studies with a considerable time of follow-up reported only one relapse in most children with MDEM [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], distinguishing the demyelinating process as self-limited and not associated with a lifelong disorder.",

Brain malignancies, Shilder's disease, Marburg's variant of MS, and brain abscess should be considered when large focal tumour-like lesions are detected on MRI [80], [81], [82], [83], [84]. A lesion pattern with symmetric bithalamic involvement may be seen in children with acute necrotizing encephalopathy, deep cerebral venous thrombosis, hypernatremia and extrapontine myelinolysis, as well as in children with ADEM after Japanese B encephalitis vaccination [85], [86], [87], [88], [89], [90], [91]. Lesions in the basal ganglia may be consistent with organic aciduria, infantile bilateral striatal necrosis, M. pneumoniae infection, voltage-gated potassium channel antibody associated encephalitis and poststreptococcal ADEM with auto-reactive antibasal ganglia antibodies [31], [92], [93], [94]. The presence of complete ring-enhanced lesions in the cerebral white matter is unusual in DEM, and brain abscess, tuberculomas, neurocysticercosis, toxoplasmosis and histoplasmosis should be excluded [54], [95].",

            "text": "The precise pathogenesis of DEM is still unclear; however given its histological features, it has been likened to the animal model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and Theiler murine encephalomyelitis. In EAE, animals are immunized with a combination of encephalitogenic myelin proteins or peptides, developing a monophasic syndrome of motor weakness and incontinence, associated with diffuse CNS inflammatory demyelination [121], [122]. Viral or bacterial epitopes resembling myelin antigens have the capacity to activate myelin-reactive T cell clones through molecular mimicry [123], and can thereby elicit a CNS-specific autoimmune response. Thus, it has been suggested that preceding infections in DEM may elicit a cross-reactive anti-myelin reaction through a mechanism of molecular mimicry. Another animal model, putatively mimicking postinfectious DEM, is created by direct inoculation of genetically susceptible mice with Theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) (picornavirus), inducing widespread CNS inflammatory demyelination through an immune-mediated reaction primarily involving TMEV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells [124], [125], [126], [127]. The TMEV model highlights the phenomenon of epitope spreading secondary to a destructive CNS viral infection resulting in a secondary autoimmune response and chronic inflammation [128], [129], [130]. Although this model superficially bears some resemblance to DEM, the epitope spreading is more likely to be an important phenomenon in chronic inflammatory disorders such as MS. Alternatively, the molecular mimicry hypothesis suggests that structural similarities between the pathogen (viral/vaccine polypeptides) and the host (central or peripheral nerve myelin) are sufficient to induce T cell activation but not sufficient to induce tolerance.",

On examination he was alert, with cerebellar ataxia, left hemiparesis and bilateral pyramidal signs. Oligoclonal bands were positive in CSF. A new brain MRI showed bilateral ill-defined lesions in the periventricular and subcortical white matter (C). The boy received methylprednisolone pulse-therapy with good recovery. After a new clinical attack 3 months later the diagnosis of paediatric MS was made and treatment with IFN beta-1a was begun. The last two images (D and E) were obtained 6 years after the first event showing well-defined new lesions, perpendicular to the long axis of the corpus callosum, which positively correlate with the diagnosis of MS.",
