Staff members presenting with an influenza-like illness (defined as a reported fever AND one of: cough, sore throat, runny nose, myalgia, headache) or persistent cough, were directed to self-swab in the on-site assessment pods previously used for testing of ambulatory patients in the community.

From 16 March, asymptomatic household members of any person with a fever or new cough were advised to self-isolate for 14 days [4]. The combined impact has meant that healthcare workers (HCW) with symptoms or with a symptomatic household member have been unable to work, exacerbating pre-existing staff shortages in frontline services in the National Health Service (NHS). In a survey of 5,194 doctors across the UK conducted over 24 h on 17 March, 12.8% were unable to work because they were symptomatic, and a further 15.1% were unable to work because of a symptomatic household contact (Michael Marks, personal communication, 26 March 2020). At that time, PHE guidance stated that frontline staff who had been exposed to patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection without wearing personal protective equipment should continue to work so long as they remain asymptomatic [5]. This scenario has led to anxiety among exposed staff. Furthermore, in these conditions, staff members with only mild symptoms may feel pressured to continue working. Figure 2 describes the timeline of key guidance impacting HCW in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK.",

In a time where healthcare systems are particularly stretched, it is important to be able to maximise the available workforce. Facilitating testing may substantially decrease absence in staff when SARS-CoV-2 can be excluded. The sensitivity, and therefore the false-negative rate, of the two-gene target RT-PCR assay has not been formally described in the early stages of illness. However, SARS-2-CoV viral load in upper respiratory secretions is highest between 1 and 5 days from symptom onset, which is the optimal time to test symptomatic HCW [6]. If this test is negative, provided HCW are well and their symptoms have resolved (except for cough which is known to persist following any respiratory viral illness), it is reasonable that they return to work. Another major issue for healthcare staffing in the UK is that asymptomatic HCW must self-isolate for 14 days when they have a symptomatic family member. An additional boost to the workforce could be provided by access to testing for symptomatic household members of HCW. ",

More than a third of staff had completed at least one shift while symptomatic. A limitation of this report is that exact symptoms have not been recorded. Therefore, precise assessment of proportion of staff meeting PHE criteria for self-isolation is not possible. However, during contact of staff members testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, we ascertained that most staff who had continued to work had only mild or non-specific symptoms at the time of clinical work. Early non-specific symptoms are challenging as HCWs may inadvertently expose other staff and patients before overt clinical symptoms manifest. Subclinical and asymptomatic infection has been reported, but its role in transmission is not clear [8-11]. Testing asymptomatic staff would have significant practical limitations and is not feasible with testing capacity in the UK. However, testing staff with mild or non-specific symptoms should be considered for infection control purposes, taking into account the practical implications of last-minute staff cover, optimal timing for swabbing to reduce false-negative results and laboratory capacity for testing [12]. Another limitation of this report is the lack of data on the roles of every staff member tested, in order to be able to provide a detailed breakdown of infection rate among different staff groups.",
