In developing countries, Pneumocystis pneumonia is one of the important causes of respiratory morbidity, leading to significant mortality among children with AIDS and accounting for 10\u201340% or higher of deaths3\u20135. Molecular characterization of P. jirovecii is still in an evolving mode worldwide and has become a topic of immense research, although some studies from different parts of the globe have shown to some extent an association between genetic diversity, clinical characteristics and disease outcome, particularly in children6,7.",

Earlier studies on genetic characterization have shown that P. jirovecii is heterogeneous in distribution, i.e., genetically different strains of this organism are circulating worldwide, and these strains have associations with pathogenicity and other diverse clinical manifestations9,14\u201318. Studies have also shown that specific dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) gene mutations or genotypes of P. jirovecii were associated with decreased efficacy of sulfa treatment and disease severity19.",

MLST schemes using these gene targets were selected with a rationale that in our tertiary care hospital, we could observe severe pneumocystosis and high mortality in pediatric patients despite administration of the full course of anti-pneumocystis treatment. Hence, it was planned to extrapolate gene polymorphisms or genetic variations that are circulating among our pediatric population and have any bearing with the clinical presentations as well as in the disease outcome. The present study is the first of its kind from India because data on genetic diversity and their clinical association among pediatric populations are not available until now.",

These 37 pediatric patients (age ranging from 0.17 years to 12 years) included five HIV-infected children, ten patients with different malignant disorders, six patients with autoimmune disorders and immune deficiencies and sixteen patients from another group. These latter 16 patients had different kind of underlying diseases (had symptoms of pneumonia) and were not among the study population that had a diagnosis of HIV infection, malignancy, autoimmune disorders or immune deficiencies. These 16 patients were categorized as \u201cothers\u201d (details of each case shown in Tables 1 and 2). Samples from twenty-five patients (25/37;68%) were microscopy-negative; however, these patients were considered true-PCP cases because each of them had clinical features highly suggestive of Pneumocystis pneumonia at the time of hospital admission. Upon further analyses, it was observed that 27 patients had intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and 25 (92.5%) of them required mechanical ventilation. Twenty-seven patients (27/37; 73%) had mild hypoxemia with partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) less than 95%, and 10 patients had severe hypoxemia with PaO2 less than 60%. Twelve out of 37 PCP patients (32%) had coinfections with bacterial and viral pathogens, as shown in Tables 3 and 4. After confirmed laboratory diagnosis of PCP, all positive pediatric patients were given a combination of anti-pneumocystis treatment (TMP-SMX), except in one patient, where TMP-SMX was given initially, but later, the treatment was switched to intravenous clindamycin due to deranged liver function. Thirty-one patients (84%) had less than four weeks (<4 weeks) of hospital stay, whereas 6 patients (16.2%) had more than four weeks (>4 weeks) of hospital stay. Despite anti-Pneumocystis treatment, 17 patients (45.9%) had fatal outcomes due to hypoxemic pneumonia, which included 12 microscopy-positive samples and five of the 25 testing positives by nPCR assay only. Among these 17 patients with negative outcomes, nine patients had coinfections with bacterial or viral pathogens (P-value = 0.069). All survival cases were followed-up for 4 weeks after discharge to confirm their progress of recovery.",

Mutations that were observed in the present study at nucleotide positions 288 (G to A) and 294 (G to C) were nonsynonymous, resulting in an amino acid change from valine to isoleucine at codon 96 (Val96Ile) and glutamic acid to glutamine at codon 98 (Glu98Gln), respectively. Overall, in the present study, we observed three novel DHPS mutations or genetic variations: mutant 96 (21/30; 70%); mutant 98 (14/30; 47%) and double mutant 96/98 (13/30; 43%).",

Only 12 patients were positive by microscopic examination (GMS) out of 37 patients who were positive by mt LSU rRNA nested PCR assay. All microscopy-positive PCP cases had fatal outcomes. The remaining 25 cases were clinically documented cases of PCP, as all these cases had a high index of clinical suspicion of Pneumocystis pneumonia at the time of presentation and further supported by a positive PCR assay. In this context, studies have previously reported that microscopy-negative PCP cases may also be addressed as possible or probable cases under the following conditions: (i) if clinical findings are consistent with PCP, (ii) if they are positive by PCR (mtLSUrRNA) assay, and (iii) if resolution of symptoms with empiric anti-Pneumocystis therapy observed22\u201324. Furthermore, of these 25 clinically documented cases of PCP, 54% (20/37) patients responded to anti-Pneumocystis treatment, and 13.5% (5/37) succumbed to death because of severe pneumonia resulting in respiratory failure. Moreover, nested PCR assays targeting mtLSUrRNA for PCP diagnosis have been considered more sensitive than microscopic examinations performed by GMS staining or single-step PCR assays if the patients were clinically symptomatic, i.e., clinically documented PCP cases25\u201329. In the context of colonization, a recently published study from Poland, performed on Pneumocystis colonized cases, stated that P. jirovecii-colonized patients were defined as individuals who did not have clinical symptoms or radiological signs of PCP30.",

In our study, patients with DHPS mutations 96 (Val > Ile) were associated with severe hypoxia (p-value = 0.01) during PCP episodes and required mechanical ventilation (p-value = 0.04). Thirteen out of 21 patients harboring this mutation (Val96Ile) also had fatal outcomes. Patients infected with both DHPS mutations together (double mutant Val96Ile/Glu98Gln) were frequently associated with no response to anti-pneumocystis treatment (TMP-SMX). The possible reason behind the occurrence of these point mutations could be attributed as the same as mentioned for DHFR gene mutations observed in the present study. In addition to these findings, we observed that mutations or genetic variations in our study (Val96Ile and Glu98Gln) were in the same conserved region (in the same coding regions) as those mutations that have been described previously for drug resistance (Thr55Ala and Pro57Ser) in Pneumocystis jirovecii40. Hence, it is strongly suggested that these novel mutations may also exert similar drug resistance effects. Similar findings had been reported by a study from Santiago, Chile, where authors suggested that patients infected with DHPS mutants required a twice-longer duration of mechanical ventilation and showed decreased efficacy of TMP-SMX.

These two STs were considered more virulent or pathogenic, as these were associated with high mortality among PCP-proven cases (PJ1, P = 0.009; PJ3, P = 0.02), especially among patients presented with severe pneumonia in comparison to other underlying causes (HIV-seropositive, malignant disorders, autoimmune disorders, immune-deficiencies). In further analyses, we observed that wild type genotypes (DHFR, DHPS) were associated with HIV-seropositive patients (P-value < 0.05), indicating concomitant severity of underlying conditions and coinfections in these patients (4 out of 5 PCP patients with HIV-seropositivity had coinfections with M. tuberculosis and 2 of them died).",

Infection by these mutant strains can lead to severe PCP, drug resistance and/or treatment failure. Coinfecting pathogens should always be monitored simultaneously with P. jirovecii-infected in children, as coinfections mostly results in poor outcomes. An effective alternate anti-pneumocystis treatment should always be considered well in time in the case of nonresolution of symptoms due to Pneumocystis pneumonia. In this context, it is proposed that research from different parts of the world, including a large number of patients, may reveal more of these mutations and sequence types to reinforce the genotype association with clinical variability and disease outcome.",

These patients were clinically suspected cases of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and had at least had two of the typical features suggestive of PCP, such as fever, unproductive cough, and dyspnea, at the time of enrollment with suggestive radiological findings, such as chest radiographs showing diffuse bilateral peri-hilar infiltrates or CT scan showing ground-glass opacities. Various relevant clinical details were recorded (Table 5). A follow-up study was conducted in all patients. \u201cPositive follow-up\u201d was considered when the PCP-positive patients responded to the anti-pneumocystis treatment (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole; TMP-SMX) and survived for at least four weeks after recovery from the disease.
