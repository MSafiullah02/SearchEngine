            "text": "The sudden failure of a previously healthy and functioning liver is a dramatic and devastating event. Acute liver failure is the common final pathway of a multitude of conditions and insults, all of which result in massive hepatic necrosis or loss of normal hepatic function. The ensuing multiorgan system failure frequently has a fatal outcome, with mortality rates in most series ranging from approximately 55% to 95% [1] . Acute liver failure (ALF, previously often referred to as fulminant hepatic failure (FHF)) knows no age boundaries, with many cases occurring in those younger than 30 years. Short of excellent intensive care unit (ICU) support and liver transplantation in selected cases, few viable treatment options are available. Over the past few decades, however, survival has been improved by anticipation, recognition, and early treatment of associated complications, as well as the application of prognostic criteria for early identification of patients requiring liver transplantation (along with improvement in the techniques and science of transplantation itself). The etiology of ALF varies from country to country and the incidence change over time. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) has now replaced viral hepatitis as the leading cause of ALF [2] . In a study from London including 310 patients with ALF in the period 1994-2004, 42% of the cases were caused by paracetamol [3] , whereas this was only the cause in 2% of 267 patients in Spain from 1992 to 2000 [4] . However, less than 10% of all liver transplants are performed in patients with ALF [5, 6] .",

In 1993, O'Grady and associates [8] proposed the terms hyperacute, acute, and subacute liver failure based on whether the interval between the appearance of encephalopathy and jaundice was 0-7 days, 8-28 days, or 29 days to 12 weeks, respectively. Both Bernuau and O'Grady included cases of preexisting asymptomatic chronic liver conditions. In Japan, patients with fulminant hepatitis are classified into two types according to the onset of encephalopathy (before or after 10 days). Encephalopathy occurring after 8 weeks is defined as late-onset hepatic failure (LOHF) [9] .",

            "text": "These classification systems reflect important differences in the clinical course and prognosis observed between patient subgroups, thus facilitating earlier diagnosis and timely referral for OLT. For example, both the hyperacute and acute liver failure groups have a high incidence of cerebral edema. However, whereas patients in the hyperacute group are more likely to survive with medical management, patients in the acute liver failure group tend to die without liver transplantation [8] . The subacute failure group has a lower incidence of cerebral edema and a higher incidence of portal hypertension manifestations, including ascites and renal failure [8] . Mortality in this group remains high. O'Grady and colleagues found that the hyperacute failure group had a 36% survival rate, as opposed to 7% and 14% in the acute and subacute failure cohorts, respectively [8] . Bernuau and coworkers also noted that those with the most rapid onset of encephalopathy had the best chance of survival [7] . Similar observations have been made in Japan [9] . However, it is important to note that although the interval between the onset of encephalopathy and jaundice was of prognostic significance in O'Grady's cohort [1] , it was not an independent prognostic factor in Bernuau's cohort [10] , thus raising doubts about its universal applicability. Application of the O'Grady classification to 423 prospectively studied patients from a tertiary care referral center in northern India failed to yield any prognostic differences between the groups [11] .",

Damage to the cell membrane permits leakage of enzymes, coenzymes, and electrolytes from the cytosol, followed by an influx of calcium ions, which eventually results in cell death. The importance of calcium is underscored by the finding that normally vulnerable hepatocytes in vitro do not succumb to the cytotoxic effects of membraneactive toxins when calcium ions are not included in the culture medium [15] .",

Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 1 (TGF-\u03b2 1 ) has been identified as exerting an inhibitory effect on hepatic regeneration, with its effects being counteracted by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). ALF patients with viral hepatitis have demonstrated an increase in total TGF-\u03b2 1 with a less elevated HGF level, thus suggesting an imbalance in growth factor interplay as a cause of impaired hepatic regeneration [16] . This mechanism has also been suggested by research performed in posttransplant patients [17] . Studies suggest that activation of the cytokine network may represent the common final pathway for the development of ALF [18] . Although multiple inflammatory cascades come into play, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 have been identified as the more important Table 1 Definitions of liver failure Bernuau [7] Fulminant hepatic failure: encephalopathy within 2 weeks of onset of jaundice Fulminant hepatic failure: encephalopathy within 2-12 weeks of onset of jaundice O'Grady [8] Hyperacute liver failure: encephalopathy within 7 days of onset of jaundice Acute liver failure: encephalopathy within 8-28 days of onset of jaundice Tandon [12] Subacute liver failure: encephalopathy within 5-12 weeks of onset of jaundice Mochida [9] ALF defined as liver disease 26 weeks in duration, INR 1.5, and any degree of encephalopathy Fulminant hepatic failure: encephalopathy within 8 weeks of onset of jaundice Subclass acute: encephalopathy within 10 days of onset of jaundice Subclass subacute: encephalopathy within 10 days to 8 weeks of onset of jaundice mediators, along with endotoxin and nitric oxide. In response to the initial hepatic insult, interplay among these mediators sets into motion a vicious self-perpetuating cycle resulting in continued hepatic injury and multiorgan failure. Furthermore, higher levels of circulating interleukin-8 and interferon-\u03b3 have been demonstrated in patients with ALF than in healthy volunteers and those with chronic liver disease, thus suggesting a pathogenic role in acute hepatic injury. Although no relationship was found between the levels of these two markers and the clinical course, elevated levels of interleukin-10 were found to be predictive of improved outcome [19] .",

Etiologies of ALF can be divided into toxic and nontoxic. Toxic causes include pharmaceuticals, drugs of abuse, chemicals, and biologic agents. Nontoxic causes include, but are not limited to, infections, ischemia, metabolic derangements, malignancy, autoimmune problems, and primary graft failure after liver transplantation. Because ALF represents the common final pathway of injury, it is difficult to differentiate between the aforementioned causes based solely on clinical presentation and disease progression. A detailed patient history is invaluable, and a multitude of helpful diagnostic testing tools are available to help uncover the etiology of ALF in the majority of cases ( Table 2) .",

In the USA, drug-induced liver injury is responsible for almost 50% of ALF [21, 22] most often caused by APAP. In London, UK, APAP poisoning was responsible for 57% of ALF cases seen at King's College Hospital between 1973 and 1991, whereas in France, APAP was identified as the etiology in only 2% of ALF cases between 1972 and 1990 [23, 24] . A multicenter study from the USA of 295 patients in whom ALF was diagnosed between 1994 and 1996 found that the most common etiologies were APAP (20%), viral hepatitis (10% hepatitis B, 7% hepatitis A), cryptogenic (15%), and drug reactions (12%) [25] . Outside of the USA and Europe, drugs are less likely to cause ALF. In a Japanese study [26] , the percentage of drug allergy-induced ALF in 432 patients collected in the period 1998-2006 was 2% in contrast to viral infection which was diagnosed as the cause in 16% of the patients (13% with hepatitis B). Even though APAP overdose was found to represent one-sixth of all causes of ALF leading to registration for liver transplantation in Europe, there was a 50-fold difference in the relative risk of ALF leading to registration for liver transplantation between countries with a low incident rate (e.g., Italy with 0.03 ALF per million inhabitants per year) and high incident rate (e.g., Ireland with 7.13 ALF per million inhabitants per year). The reasons for these differences remain unclear, but may be related to national differences in pack size restriction of APAP or antidote treatment regimens [27] .",

            "text": "Pharmaceuticals Hepatotoxicity can result from therapeutic or toxic doses of many medications by a multitude of mechanisms. It can be manifested as asymptomatic elevations of liver enzymes, but some cases can progress to ALF. Hepatocyte injury can occur directly from disruption of intracellular function or membrane integrity or indirectly from immune-mediated membrane disruption. Drugs can also cause cholestasis, steatosis, idiosyncratic reactions, fibrosis, veno-occlusive disease, Acute APAP overdose (both deliberate and unintentional/supratherapeutic ingestion) remains one of the most common causes of ALF in the USA and UK (see \u25b6 Chap. 59, \"Acetaminophen/ Paracetamol\"). The maximum daily approved dose may vary depending on the country, but is generally in the range of 80 mg/kg APAP for children and 3-4 g for adults. The minimum dose for toxicity from a single ingestion is generally 150 mg/kg for children and 7.5-10 g for adults [28] . Doses greater than 350 mg/kg almost always result in severe hepatotoxicity without antidotal treatment [23] . However, APAP toxicity is increasingly being recognized as a cause of ALF even when used in supratherapeutic doses, and such \"therapeutic misadventures\" may represent the most common cause of ALF in the USA [29] . These cases usually occur when APAP is misused in the setting of chronic pain and alcohol use or less commonly with medications that induce the cytochrome P-450 system (e.g., isoniazid [INH] , rifampin, phenytoin) or in the setting of starvation (depleted glutathione [GSH] stores) [30, 31] . High aminotransferase levels are typical of such cases, with values usually peaking above 4000 U/L and sometimes above 10,000 U/L.",

The resultant toxic metabolites covalently bind to important macromolecular constituents of the cell and prevent normal functioning or cause necrosis of the cell. Acetaminophen metabolism ( Fig. 1 ) serves as a pertinent example. Most of the ingested APAP is conjugated with glucuronide or sulfate and excreted as a harmless metabolite [32, 33] . In therapeutic doses, approximately 5% of APAP is oxidized by the P-450 system to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), a toxic intermediate that is readily detoxified by reaction with GSH [32, 33] . An APAP overdose overwhelms the sulfation and glucuronidation pathways and drives the formation of NAPQI, detoxification of which depletes GSH stores [32, 33] . Once the binding capacity of GSH is exceeded, NAPQI covalently binds to key hepatocyte membrane and cellular proteins and causes necrosis [22, 23] .",

For example, alcohol [34] , INH [35] , and possibly phenytoin [36] cause induction of the P-450 system, which enhances the conversion of APAP to NAPQI. In addition, alcohol inhibits the synthesis of GSH, thereby decreasing clearance of NAPQI [37] . Chronic alcohol abusers are also more likely to be malnourished and have an antecedent fasting period, which also depletes GSH stores. Thus, supratherapeutic doses of APAP in conjunction with regular alcohol use can result in elevated NAPQI levels and subsequent hepatic injurythe so-called therapeutic misadventure [38] . It is important to note that starvation, a GSH-depleted state, is an independent risk factor for a therapeutic misadventure with APAP, regardless of concurrent alcohol use. Another example of synergistic toxicity is noted in patients treated with INH and rifampin, where rifampin-induced cytochrome induction can potentiate INH hepatotoxicity [39] .",

Hepatic failure in these cases may be the result of liver ischemia, hypoxemia, severe hyperpyrexia, rhabdomyolysis, and/or direct hepatotoxic effect. In addition to these effects, cocaine's hepatotoxicity is thought to be due primarily to ischemia from systemic arterial vasospasm and congestive heart failure, complicated by the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and renal failure. The histologic pattern is both centrilobular necrosis and microvesicular steatosis. MDMA causes a syndrome similar to that of cocaine: hyperthermia, DIC, and rhabdomyolysis, complicated further by dehydration and acute renal failure. Toxic hepatitis may be immediate or delayed, and the histopathology is characterized by central and midzonal necrosis or by steatosis and eosinophilic infiltration [48] . The latter suggests an immune mechanism of MDMA hepatotoxicity, and liver transplantation has been required in some cases [49] .",

An increase in the incidence of mushroom poisoning is usually seen after periods of heavy rainfall or during the fall, when the conditions for growth are optimal. Ingestion of cyclopeptide-containing mushrooms accounts for up to 90% of mushroom-related deaths worldwide [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] . The genus Amanita is the source of most of these poisonings, especially A. phalloides (death cap), A. verna (death angel), and A. virosa (destroying angel). Galerina and Lepiota species can also be hepatotoxic (see Table 2 ). Amanita species are found primarily in the temperate coastal regions of the west coast of the USA, but they have also adapted to the mid-Atlantic coast and the northeast. A. phalloides is the predominant hepatotoxic European mushroom. The mushroom itself has no distinct taste, smell, or appearance. Ingestion is usually followed 6-12 h later by fever, nausea, vomiting, and severe diarrhea. Renal and hepatic impairment may become evident by 24-48 h while the patient appears to be recovering clinically. However, renal failure and hepatic failure progress and tend to become severe by day 3-5, with the development of jaundice, encephalopathy, and possibly death. Liver transplantation has been carried out successfully for cases of severe Amanita poisoning [53] . Some Amanita mushrooms such as A. muscaria and A. pantherina do not contain hepatotoxins.",

The majority of cases are related to hepatitis A and E infections globally with death rates of more than 50% reported from the developing world [59, 60] . Also hepatitis B infection may lead to ALF [61] . It is unclear why ALF develops in a select proportion of the infected population, but historical review of previous epidemics reveals that this number remains surprisingly constant at approximately 0.4% [62] . The hepatocellular necrosis seen in cases of ALF caused by hepatitis A and B is thought to be due in part to a direct cytopathic effect of the virus. This mechanism is supported by the relative lack of inflammation seen in the livers of patients with viral ALF. However, the normal humoral and cellmediated response to a massively infected liver also plays a role. One study found that the amount of hepatitis A virus (HAV) isolated from the livers of patients with HAV-associated ALF was higher than titers from patients with nonfulminant HAV hepatitis [63] . In addition, CD8 + T lymphocytes isolated from the livers of two patients with acute HAV infection demonstrated the ability to kill HAV-infected fibroblasts in culture, thus implying that the liver damage seen in virally induced ALF is in part cell mediated [64] .",

Patients have a comparatively low mortality rate (<40%) and usually recover without liver transplantation. Acute hepatitis B infection progresses to ALF in approximately 1% of infected patients, thus making hepatitis B virus (HBV) the most common viral cause of ALF [58] . Its role may be underestimated when the impact of infection with a pre-core mutant (HBV viral infection that does not produce the surface [HBsAg] or e antigen) is taken into account, as demonstrated by a study in which it was found that 35% of patients who underwent transplantation for non-A, non-B hepatitis had evidence of HBV infection by polymerase chain reaction [65] . One half to one third of patients with ALF secondary to HBV will clear HBsAg within a few days [66] ; such rapid clearance is thought to be the result of a substantial immunologic response to HBV-laden hepatocytes. Interestingly, those who clear HBsAg rapidly have a more favorable prognosis (47% survival rate) than those with continued HBsAg positivity (17% survival rate) [13] . Despite being an increasingly common cause of chronic liver disease, isolated infection with hepatitis C virus has yet to be definitively implicated in ALF [10] . Though rarely encountered in the USA, infection with hepatitis E virus in pregnant women carries a 40% mortality rate [67] . Infection with hepatitis delta virus has been implicated in about 30% of HBV-related ALF cases. In fact, the risk of ALF increases dramatically with any hepatitis virus coinfection [68, 69] .",

Other helpful signs on physical examination include decreased or absent dullness to percussion in the right upper quadrant, indicative of reduced hepatic mass secondary to necrosis. Fetor hepaticus is usually present, but recognition of this condition is somewhat subjective. Ascites is more common with subfulminant hepatic failure. Stigmata of chronic liver disease do not support a diagnosis of ALF as per the classic definition. Low blood pressure (decreased systemic vascular resistance) and hypothermia may also be evident.

Complications seen in the course of the illness include cerebral edema; renal failure; cardiovascular, pulmonary, and metabolic derangements; and problems with infection, GI bleeding, and malnutrition. Multiorgan failure is commonly encountered. There is an inverse relationship between the presence and number of complications and patient survival.

Table 4 delineates the grading system used for acute hepatic encephalopathy; the presence of stupor or coma portends a poorer prognosis. Although the exact pathogenesis remains elusive, the encephalopathy is reversible and thought to be metabolic. Structural changes such as those seen with Alzheimer's disease are not part of the syndrome. It is postulated that elevated levels of neuroactive humoral substances secondary to decreased hepatic clearance cause the observed mental status changes. It is important to note that the blood-brain barrier is disrupted in ALF, and this increased permeability makes it unnecessary for a substance to be present in greater than normal concentration in plasma to affect cerebral function. In addition, with the blood-brain barrier demonstrating marked regional differences in permeability, the concentration of potentially encephalopathic agents at critical subcellular sites may be more important than their concentration in cerebrospinal fluid or plasma [75] . Studies have implicated increased GABAergic (transmitting or secreting \u03b3-aminobutyric acid) tone, mediated by an endogenous benzodiazepine-like ligand, as a cause of the hepatic encephalopathy seen in ALF [76] . Treatment with flumazenil (a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) has been shown to temporarily improve the coma grade of patients suffering from this syndrome.",

Research indicates a complex interplay among vasogenic (alterations in blood flow), cytotoxic (loss of osmoregulation), and hydrocephalic (extracellular expansion) factors. Even though earlier histologic studies of the brain revealed no abnormalities [79] , more recent data have found alterations in cell membrane integrity and blood-brain barrier permeability [80, 81] , changes probably responsible for the increased water content and weight of the brain. Although patients with cirrhosis rarely have cerebral edema, a marked decrease in intracranial blood flow has been noted in those with acute or chronic encephalopathy [82] . This decreased blood flow, along with the systemic hypotension commonly found in ALF (see the next section) and the increased ICP secondary to cerebral edema, predisposes the brain to ischemic injury. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = mean arterial pressure [MAP] -ICP) below 40-50 mmHg is associated with ischemic brain injury and can have permanent consequences, even if the liver recovers fully. A persistent and refractory perfusion pressure of less than 40 mmHg precludes transplantation [83] . Signs of increased ICP are noted in Table 5 . Because they are manifested Although computed tomography (CT) scans are often used to exclude intracerebral hemorrhage as a cause of a sudden change in mental state, their static nature in this rapidly evolving syndrome makes them unsuitable as a management guide. ICP monitoring provides reliable data on which treatment decisions can be made, and placement of a subdural or epidural transducer is indicated in patients being considered for transplantation. Patients should be transferred to a transplant center early in the course of the disease; transportation after the onset of cerebral edema and coma is fraught with danger because even positional changes can raise ICP with disastrous consequences. Factors that tend to increase ICP are noted in Table 6 . Even without herniation, cerebral edema remains the most common cause of death in ALF.",

Renal vasoconstriction leads to a drop in renal perfusion pressure, which is reflected by a decreased glomerular filtration rate and increased sodium retention (causing ascites and edema). The presence of oliguric renal failure portends a poorer prognosis [89] . Renal ",

Hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia can also occur. Complex acid-base disturbances with multiple processes at play are seenrespiratory alkalosis as a result of spontaneous hyperventilation is commonly present early in the course of the disease. However, with disease progression and depression of the central respiratory drive secondary to edema or circulating toxins, respiratory acidosis can develop. Hypokalemia is associated with metabolic alkalosis, whereas tissue hypoxia and massive hepatic necrosis give rise to metabolic acidosis with elevated levels of lactic acid, free fatty acid, and other organic acids. The presence of lactic acidosis is a poor prognostic indicator. Impaired glucose release, loss of glycogen reserves, and decreased gluconeogenesis are in combination responsible for severe hypoglycemia (blood glucose <40 mg/dL [2.2 mmol/L]) in up to 40% of patients. Decreased hepatic metabolism of insulin resulting in inappropriately elevated plasma insulin levels also plays a pathogenic role. If unrecognized and untreated, the fall in blood glucose can be rapid and may lead to irreversible brain injury.",

However, new evidence suggest that the use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) may be superior to lactulose in the treatment of encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients [104] (Grade I recommendation). Oral neomycin has traditionally been added if the encephalopathy is difficult to control, but it has possible nephrotoxic and ototoxic side effects. Modern drugs of choice instead are metronidazole, 250-500 mg two to three times a day, aminopenicillins, 2-4 g/day, or vancomycin, 1-2 g/day.

Given the deadly consequences of unrecognized cerebral edema and the difficulty in diagnosing it clinically, an epidural ICP monitor should be placed in all patients with grade 4 encephalopathy. This procedure has a 4% morbidity (infection, bleeding) rate and a 1% mortality rate and is thus safer than placement of a subdural, parenchymal, or intraventricular catheter [107] . Coagulopathy should be addressed before placement of an ICP monitor, and head CT should be considered to rule out other causes of acute mental status changes such as intracranial hemorrhage. The aim is to keep ICP lower than 20 mmHg and CPP (MAP -ICP = CPP) higher than 50 mmHg [2] (Grade III recommendation). Elevated ICP can be treated with mannitol boluses (0.5-1 g/kg to achieve a plasma osmolality between 310 and 325 mOsm/kg) [108] . Clinicians should be vigilant for signs of volume overload with mannitol use; concurrent ultrafiltration or other dialysis methods may be needed to avoid hypervolemia. In addition, patients should be stimulated as little as possible because agitation can increase ICP. Sedatives should be used in the lowest dose possible so that the degree of encephalopathy can continue to be monitored. Shortacting drugs such as propofol should be used [109] . Elevating the head of the bed can decrease ICP, but it also causes CPP to fall and leads to paradoxical increases in ICP when elevation is above 30 [102] . In the absence of ICP monitoring, the head of the bed should be elevated 10-20 (Grade III recommendation). The use of positive end-expiratory pressure during ventilation can also worsen cerebral edema [110] . Dexamethasone has been proved to be ineffective as treatment of cerebral edema and should therefore not be used [111] . Hyperventilation to lower PCO 2 has not been shown to be beneficial [102] .",

The difficulty lies in accurately categorizing patients into one of these two groups and doing so in a timely manner, before the complications associated with ALF preclude OLT as a therapeutic option.

Serum Gc-globulin and plasma factor V levels have been used independently to predict outcome; however, they are specialized laboratory tests that may not always be available and have not been shown to be any better than the King's College Criteria [120] .

In a single-center study, the prediction of non-surviving APAP-induced ALF patients using lactate was similar to KCH criteria but identified them earlier [122] .
