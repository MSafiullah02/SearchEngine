RNAi holds great promise to provide a flexible approach that can rapidly be adapted to new viral target sequences. A major challenge in the development of an efficient RNAi approach still remains the design of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) with high silencing potency. While large libraries with validated siRNAs exist for silencing of endogenously expressed genes in human or murine cells, siRNAs still have to be designed individually for new antiviral approaches. The present chapter describes strategies to design highly potent siRNAs by taking into consideration thermodynamic features of the siRNA, as well as the structural restrictions of the target RNA. Furthermore, assays for testing the siRNAs in reporter assays as well as options to improve the properties of siRNAs by the introduction of modified nucleotides will be described. Finally, experimental setups will be outlined to test the siRNAs in assays with infectious viruses.",

For applications in mammalian cells, small interfering RNAs (siRNA) of approximately 19 base pairs with two nucleotide overhangs at the 3\u00a2 ends of both strands become incorporated into the RNAinduced silencing complex (RISC) and induce cleavage of a complementary target RNA. Within just a few years, RNAi has become a standard molecular biological method to study gene functions. Moreover, the technology has been developed into a new therapeutic approach and approximately a dozen clinical trials based on RNAi are currently underway. Among these trials are various applications of RNAi to treat infections with the respiratory syncytial virus, HBV and HIV (5) .",

Unfortunately, simply directing siRNAs to protein coding regions is insufficient, since silent mutations can cause the siRNAs to lose their inhibitory potential. Target regions with an important function in the structure of the RNA may prove to be a better choice to avoid viral escape. It has, for example, been shown that an siRNA against the highly conserved cis-acting replication element (CRE) was capable of inhibiting various enteroviruses over a long period, while an siRNA targeted against protein-encoding regions of the RNA, which are not organized into functional three dimensional structures, led to rapid viral escape (8) . Since even the most careful selection of a single target site might be insufficient for sustained viral silencing, use of multiple siRNAs against multiple target sites may be necessary to prevent viral escape. In the case of coxsackievirus B3 and HIV-1, resistance rapidly emerged when single molecules were used, but a combination of three or four siRNAs, respectively, targeting distinct regions of the genome, were able to prevent the emergence of resistance (9, 10) .",

A fully modified siRNA with a drastically increased half-life in human serum had a significantly higher activity in a vector-based in vivo model of HBV infection as compared to the unmodified form (12) . Furthermore, the introduction of modified nucleotides not only improves the stability of siRNAs, but can also reduce off-target effects (13) and improves the antiviral activity of siRNAs directed against highly structured target regions (14) .",

The reduction of virus titer shows directly the efficiency of an siRNA as the virus spread is prevented. An alternative protocol can be used to accelerate the staining (see Note 22) . Efficient siRNAs are able to reduce the virus titer at least one order of magnitude. Figure 4 shows an example of such a plaque reduction assay. Selected (antiviral) siRNAs which show high efficiency may be chemically modified to decrease potential off-target effects and/ or to enhance serum stability. One approach to reduce off-target effects is to prevent the incorporation of the unwanted sense strand in RISC. This can, for example, be achieved by an LNA modification at the 5\u00a2 end (21) , or by introduction of a 2\u00a2-O-methyl modification at position 1 and 2 (13) of the sense strand. However, a specific reduction of off-target effects was observed when position 2 of the antisense strand was additional 2\u00a2-O-methyl modified (13) . In theory, chemical modifications of an siRNA will also result in increased serum stability. In practice, siRNA modifications are often accompanied by decreased silencing efficiency compared to the unmodified siRNA. LNA modifications introduced at any position except 1, 10, 12, and 14 in the antisense strand do not cause substantial loss of silencing efficiency (21) . Another way to combine high silencing efficiency, increased serum stability, and reduced off-target effects is complete modification",

The control infection should show as many individual plaques as can be reliably counted. An effective siRNA will appreciably reduce the number of plaques, while a weak siRNA may only lead to a slight reduction. A large number of distinguishable plaques on the control plate will simplify the recognition of weak siRNAs, which may be desirable if further optimization is possible. 19 . FCS within a medium may interfere with viral infection efficiency. 20 . Incubation time depends on the infection cycle of a specific virus. 21 . Neutral red as well as crystal violet is taken up by healthy cells, but not by dead cells. Plaques therefore appear as clear circles against the red/violet background. If the clear areas overlap too much, it is difficult to recognize individual plaques and infection time should be reduced. If plaques are too small to be easily read, try extending infection time, though it could also be an indication of a defective or weakened strain. 22 . The staining can be accelerated by using crystal violet solution. To this end, fix the cells with 10% TCA for 10 min at room temperature. Then remove the agar without disturbing the cell monolayer and add 500 ml of crystal violet solution (0.5% solution in PBS) to each of the wells and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (see Note 21) . Remove the stain by aspiration and wash with PBS. Invert the plate, and count the plaques of each well. Calculate the viral titer as described in Subheading 3.5.2, step 22.",

Example: The virus titer is 2.5 \u00d7 10 7 plaque forming units (pfu)/ml. If 50 ml per well of the virus suspension is added to the cells, the titer will be 1.25 \u00d7 10 6 pfu per well.
