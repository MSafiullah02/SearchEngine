Although seasonal patterns of virus activity could orientate the etiological diagnosis, several viruses can be cocirculating at the same time throughout the year (Ruuskanen et al., 2011). Rapid etiological diagnosis of ARI improves patients' management, as it allows for appropriate and on-time antiviral therapy, which has demonstrated a reduction of complications, duration of symptoms, and hospital stay (D\u2019Heilly et al., 2008, Fiore et al., 2011).

Antigens are sandwiched by capture antibodies and fluorescently labeled antibodies conjugate onto polymer microspheres, forming immunocomplexes in proportion to the concentration of antigen in the sample. The fluorescence signal from individual microspheres is measured by a separation-free assay method based on 2-photon excitation fluorescence detection technology (ArcDia) (Koskinen et al., 2007). The system automatically reports preliminary results in 20 min for samples with high viral load and final results in 2 hours. The instrument allows semicontinuous loading every 5 min, which is the time that it takes for each sample processing. Up to 6 samples can be loaded in the instrument in the same run.",
