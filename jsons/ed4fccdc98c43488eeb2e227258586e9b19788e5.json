With workers required to stand shoulder to shoulder on the slaughter line, it's no surprise. In South Dakota, as reported in mid-April, at least 40% of infections had occurred at a single Smithfield Foods slaughter plant (Dickerson and Jordan 2020) . As the number of infected workers soared and caused staff shortages, the Smithfield plant and many others closed or dramatically slowed production (Corkery and Yaffe-Bellany 2020) . While sensible, this initiated a cascade of consequences throughout the industry supply chain, including the planned on-farm killing of millions of animals who had been scheduled for slaughter (Lauria 2020) .",

The human death rate for H5N1, a strain of bird flu, surpasses that of COVID-19 (CDC 2015) . Almost certainly, it will cause pandemics of the future, unless we act now. As one scientist warns, factory farms are \"the most likely epicenter of the next pandemic\" (Hollenbeck 2016) . The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations even stated that \"livestock health is the weakest link in our global health chain\" (FAO 2013).",
