The study of the complexity of MCSP is therefore the canonical metacomplexity-theoretic question. Complexity theoreticians are fond of complaining that the problems they confront (showing that computational problems are hard to compute) are notoriously difficult. But is this really true? Is it hard to show that a particular function is difficult to compute? This question can be made precise by asking about the computational complexity of MCSP.

This is intentional. In this survey, the distinctions between these two notions will be blurred, in order to keep the discussion on a high level. Some of the theorems that will be mentioned below are only known to hold for the prefix-free variant, but the reader is encouraged to ignore these finer distinctions here, and seek the more detailed information in the cited references. For some Turing machines U , K U (x) will not be defined for some x, and the values of K U (x) and K U (x) can be very different, for different machines U and U . But the beauty of Kolmogorov complexity (and the applicability of of the theory it gives rise to) derives from the fact that if U and U are universal Turing machines, then K U (x) and K U (x) differ by at most O(1).

Kt(x) also corresponds to the circuit size of the function x, but not on \"normal\" circuits. As is shown in [2] , Kt(x) is roughly the same as the size of the smallest oracle circuit that computes x, where the oracle is a complete set for EXP. (An oracle circuit has \"oracle gates\" in addition to the usual AND, OR, and NOT gates; an oracle gate for oracle A has k wires leading into it, and if those k wires encode a bitstring y of length k where y is in A, then the gate outputs 1, otherwise it outputs 0.) It is clearly desirable to have a version of Kolmogorov complexity that is more closely related to \"ordinary\" circuit size, instead of oracle circuit size. This is accomplished by defining KT(x) to be min{|d| + t : U (d, i) = x i in time t}. (More precise definitions can be found in [2, 10] . ) We have now presented a number of different measures K \u00b5 \u2208 {K, K t , Kt, KT}. By analogy with MCSP, we can study K \u00b5 in place of the \"circuit size\" measure, and thus obtain various problems of the form MK \u00b5 P = {(x, i) : K \u00b5 (x) \u2264 i}, such as MKTP, MK t P and MKtP. If t(n) = n O(1) , then MK t P is in NP, and several theorems about MKTP yield corollaries about MK t P in this case. (See, e.g. [2] ). Similarly, if t(n) = 2 n c for some c > 0, then MK t P is in EXP, and several theorems about MKtP yield corollaries about MK t P for t in this range [2] .",

Let K poly serve as a shorthand for K t whenever t = n O (1) , and similarly let K exp serve as a shorthand for K t whenever t = 2 n c for some c > 0. We will thus be referring to MK poly P and MK exp P. Doing so will enable us to avoid some confusing notation surrounding the name MINKT , which was introduced by Ko [31] to denote the set {x, 1 t , 1 i : \u2203d U(d) = x in at most t steps and |d| \u2264 i}. That is, (x, i) \u2208 MK poly P iff (x, 1 n c , i) \u2208 MINKT (where the time bound t(n) = n c ). Hence these sets have comparable complexity and results about MINKT can be rephrased in terms of MK poly P with only a small loss of accuracy. In particular, some recent important results [19, 20] are phrased in terms of MINKT , and as such they deal with K poly complexity, and they are not really very closely connected with the KT measure; the name MINKT was devised more than a decade before KT was formulated. The reader who is interested in the details should refer to the original papers for the precise formulation of the theorems. However, the view presented here is \"probably approximately correct\".",

Most hardness results for MCSP actually hold for GapMCSP, and if the \"gap\" is large enough, then MKTP is a solution to GapMCSP (and vice-versa). Furthermore it has frequently been the case that a theorem about MCSP was first proved for MKTP and then the result for MCSP was obtained as a corollary. However, there is no efficient reduction known (in either direction) between MCSP and MKTP, and there are some theorems that are currently known to hold only for MKTP, although they are suspected to hold also for MCSP (e.g., [4, 6, 23] ).

But one thing should jump out at the reader from Table 1 : All of the conditions listed in Column 3 (with the exception of \"FALSE\") are widely believed to be true, although they all seem to be far beyond the reach of current proof techniques. It is significant that neither MCSP nor MKTP is NP-complete under \u2264 n 1/3 m reductions, since SAT and many other well-known problems are complete under this very restrictive notion of reducibility -but it would be more satisfying to know whether these problems can be complete under more widely-used reducibilities such as \u2264 AC 0 m . These sublinear-time reductions are so restrictive, that even the PARITY problem is not \u2264 n 1/3 m -reducible to MCSP or MKTP. In an attempt to prove that PARITY is not \u2264 AC 0 m -reducible to MKTP, we actually ended up proving the opposite: Theorem 1 [6] . MKTP is hard for DET under non-uniform NC 0 reductions.

SZK is the class of problems that have statistical zero knowledge interactive proofs; SZK contains most of the problems that are assumed to be intractable, in order to build public-key cryptosystems. Thus it is widely assumed that MCSP and related problems lie outside of P/poly, and cryptographers hope that it requires nearly exponential-sized circuits. SZK also contains the Graph Isomorphism problem, which is \u2264 RP T -reducible to MCSP and MKTP. In [4] , Graph Isomorphism (and several other problems) were shown to be \u2264 ZPP T reducible to MKTP; it remains unknown if this also holds for MCSP. In fact, there is no interesting example of a problem A that is not known to be in NP \u2229 coNP that has been shown to be \u2264 ZPP T reducible to MCSP. We close this section with a discussion of a very powerful notion of reducibility: SNP reductions. (Informally A is SNP reducible to B means that A is (NP \u2229 coNP)-reducible to B.) Hitchcock and Pavan have shown that MCSP is indeed NP-complete under SNP reductions if NP \u2229 coNP contains problems that require large circuits (which seems very plausible) [25] .

Furthermore, this happens if and only if PARITY reduces to MKTP A . Note that this condition is more likely to be true if A is easy, than if A is complex; it is false if A is complete for PSPACE, and it is probably true if A = \u2205. Thus, although MKTP QBF is almost certainly more complex than MKTP (the former is PSPACE-complete, and the latter is in NP), a reasonably-large subclass of P probably reduces to MKTP via these uniform AC 0 reductions, whereas hardly anything AC 0 -reduces to MKTP QBF .

This problem was formalized and shown to be NP-complete under \u2264 ZPP T reductions [27] . Many of the functions that we compute daily produce more than one bit of output.

This problem is called Multi-MCSP in [28] , where it is shown to be NP-complete under \u2264 RP T reductions.

(Some very weak intractability results for minimizing constant-depth circuits can be found in [5] , giving subexponential reductions from the problem of factoring Blum integers.) The first real progress on this front was reported in [22] , giving an NP-completeness result (under \u2264 P m reductions) for a class of depth three circuits (with MOD gates on the bottom level). Ilango proved that computing the size of the smallest depth-d formula for a truth-table lies outside of AC 0 [p] for any prime p [27] , and he has now followed that up with a proof that computing the size of the smallest depth-d formula is NP-complete under \u2264 RP T reductions [26] . Note that a constant-depth circuit can be transformed into a formula with only a polynomial blow-up; thus in many situations we are able to ignore the distinction between circuits and formulas in the constant-depth realm. However, the techniques employed in [26, 27] are quite sensitive to small perturbations in the size, and hence the distinction between circuits and formulae is important here. Still, this is dramatic progress on a front where progress has been very slow.",

This is the phenomenon whereby seemingly very modest lower bounds can be \"amplified\" or \"magnified\" and thereby be shown to imply superpolynomial lower bounds. I was involved in some of the early work in this direction [9] (which did not involve MCSP), but much stronger work has subsequently appeared.It is important to note, in this regard, that lower bounds have been proved for MCSP that essentially match the strongest lower bounds that we have for any problems in NP [16] . There is now a significant body of work, showing that slight improvements to those bounds, or other seemingly-attainable lower bounds for GapMKtP or GapMCSP or related problems, would yield dramatic complexity class separations [12] [13] [14] [15] 34, 38, 39, 45] .This would be a good place to survey this work, except that an excellent survey already appears in [12] . Igor Carboni Oliveira has also written some notes entitled \"Advances in Hardness Magnification\" related to a talk he gave at the Simons Institute in December, 2019, available on his home page. These notes and [12] describe in detail the reasons that this approach seems to avoid the Natural Proofs barrier identified in the work of Razborov and Rudich [42] . But they also describe some potential obstacles that need to be overcome, before this approach can truly be used to separate complexity classes.",
