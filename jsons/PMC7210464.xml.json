Several clusters of patients with similar pneumonia were reported through late December 2019. The pneumonia was later identified to be caused by a new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2) (Zhu et al. 2020), later named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO).1 While the seafood market was closed on January 1, 2020, a massive outflow of travelers during the Chinese Spring Festival travel rush (Chunyun) in mid-January2 led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout China and to other countries. The first confirmed case outside Wuhan in China was reported in Shenzhen on January 19 (Li et al. 2020). As of April 5, over 1.2 million confirmed cases were reported in at least 200 countries or territories.3",

While most Western countries initially implemented the former strategy, more and more of them (including most European countries and the USA) have since shifted towards the more stringent suppression strategy, and some other countries such as China, Singapore, and South Korea have adopted the latter strategy from the beginning. In particular, China has rolled out one of the most stringent public health strategies. That strategy involves city lockdowns and mandatory quarantines to ban or restrict traffic since January 23, social distance\u2013encouraging strategies since January 28, and a centralized treatment and isolation strategy since February 2.",

By comparing the estimates before and after February 2, we examine whether the comprehensive set of policies at the national scale delays the spread of COVID-19. Besides, we estimate the impacts of social distancing measures in reducing the transmission rate utilizing the closed management of communities and family outdoor restrictions policies that were gradually rolled out across different cities.",

First, the number of people infected by a disease usually first increases, reaches a peak, and then drops. Second, there are persistent, unobservable variables, such as clusters that generate large numbers of infections, people\u2019s living habits, and government policies. Serial correlations in errors give rise to correlations between the lagged numbers of cases and the error term, rendering the ordinary least square (OLS) estimator biased. Combining insights in Adda (2016), the existing knowledge of the incubation period of COVID-19 (World Health Organization 2020b), and data on weather conditions that affect the transmission rates of COVID-19 (Lowen and Steel 2014; Wang et al. 2020b), we construct instrumental variables for the number of new COVID-19 cases during the preceding 2 weeks. Weather characteristics in the previous third and fourth weeks do not directly affect the number of new COVID-19 cases after controlling for the number of new COVID-19 cases and weather conditions in the preceding first and second weeks. Therefore, our estimated impacts have causal interpretations and reflect population transmission rates.",

We examine whether population flows from the origin of the COVID-19 outbreak, which is a major city and an important transportation hub in central China, can explain the spread of the virus using data on real-time travel intensity between cities that have recently become available for research. Realizing the urgency of forestalling widespread community transmissions in areas that had not seen many infections, in late January, many Chinese cities implemented public health measures that encourage social distancing. We also examine the impacts of these measures on curtailing the spread of the virus.",

Preventing the transmission rates in non-Hubei cities from increasing to the level observed in late January in Hubei caused the largest reduction in the number of infections. Apart from the policies implemented nationwide, the additional social distancing policies imposed in some cities in late January further helped reduce the number of infections. By mid February, the spread of the virus was contained in China. While many socioeconomic factors moderated the spread of the virus, the actual population flow from the source posed a higher risk to destinations than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions.",

First, our analysis is connected to the economics and epidemiological literature on the determinants of the spread of infectious diseases and prevention of such spread. Existing studies find that reductions in population flow (Zhan et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020; Fang et al. 2020) and interpersonal contact from holiday school closings (Adda 2016), reactive school closures (Litvinova et al. 2019), public transportation strikes (Godzinski and Suarez Castillo 2019), strategic targeting of travelers from high-incidence locations (Milusheva 2017), and paid sick leave to keep contagious workers at home (Barmby and Larguem 2009; Pichler and Ziebarth 2017) can mitigate the prevalence of disease transmissions. In addition, studies show viruses spread faster during economic booms (Adda 2016), increases in employment are associated with increased incidence of influenza (Markowitz et al. 2019), and growth in trade can significantly increase the spread of influenza (Adda 2016) and HIV (Oster 2012). Vaccination (Maurer 2009; White 2019) and sunlight exposure (Slusky and Zeckhauser 2018) are also found effective in reducing the spread of influenza.",

Given the short time period since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, research is urgently needed to assess the dynamics of transmissions and the implications for how the COVID-19 outbreak will evolve (Wu et al. 2020b, 2020c). Liu et al. (2020) identify 12 studies that estimated the basic reproductive number in the wide range of 1.4 to 6.5 (with a mean of 3.28 and a median of 2.79) for Wuhan, Hubei, China, or overseas during January 1 through January 28, 2020.4 Our R0 estimate relies on spatially disaggregated data during an extended period (until February 29, 2020) to mitigate potential biases, and the instrumental variable approach we use isolates the causal effect of virus transmissions and imposes fewer restrictions on the relationship between the unobserved determinants of new cases and the number of cases in the past. Simultaneously considering a more comprehensive set of factors in the model that may influence virus spread, we find that one case generates 2.992 more cases within 2 weeks (1.876 if cities in Hubei province are excluded) in the sub-sample from January 19 to February 1. In the sub-sample from February 2 to February 29, the transmission rates fall to 1.243 (0.614 excluding Hubei province). Our estimate of R0 for the period in late January 2020 that overlaps with existing studies falls well within the range of the estimated R0 in the emerging COVID-19 literature (Liu et al. 2020).",

Through a set of policy simulations, we report initial evidence on the number of avoided infections through the end of February 2020 for cities outside Hubei province. Specifically, the stringent health policies at the national and provincial levels reduced the transmission rate and resulted in 1,408,479 (95% CI, 815,585 to 2,001,373) fewer infections and potentially 56,339 fewer deaths.5 In contrast, the effects of the Wuhan lockdown and local non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are considerably smaller. As a result of the Wuhan lockdown, closed management of communities, and family outdoor restrictions, 31,071 (95% CI, 8296 to 53,845), 3803 (95% CI, 1142 to 6465), and 2703 (95% CI, 654 to 4751) fewer cases were avoided, respectively. These three policies may respectively avoid 1,243 deaths, 152 deaths, and 108 deaths. Making some additional assumptions, such as the value of statistical life and lost productive time, these estimates may provide the basis for more rigorous cost-benefit analysis regarding relevant public health measures.",

First, the epidemic patterns in Wuhan are significantly different from those in other cities. Some confirmed cases in Wuhan contracted the virus through direct exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which is the most probable origin of the virus6. In other cities, infections arise from human-to-human transmissions. Second, COVID-19 cases were still pneumonia of previously unknown virus infections in people\u2019s perception until early January so that Wuhan\u2019s health care system became overwhelmed as the number of new confirmed cases increased exponentially since mid-January. This may have caused severe delay and measurement errors in the number of cases reported in Wuhan, and to a lesser extent, in other cities in Hubei province. To alleviate this concern, we also conduct analyses excluding all cities in Hubei province from our sample.",

The fact that big clusters give rise to a large number of cases within a short period of time may still be compatible with a general low rate of community transmissions, especially when measures such as social distancing are implemented.

The primary assumption on the instrumental variables is that weather conditions before 2 weeks do not affect the likelihood that a person susceptible to the virus contracts the disease, conditional on weather conditions and the number of infectious people within the 2-week window. On the other hand, they affect the number of other persons who have become infectious within the 2-week window, because they may have contracted the virus earlier than 2 weeks.

Figure 2 shows the time patterns of daily confirmed new cases in Wuhan, in Hubei province outside Wuhan, and in non-Hubei provinces of mainland China. Because Hubei province started to include clinically diagnosed cases into new confirmed cases on February 12, we notice a spike in the number of new cases in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province on this day (Fig. 2). The common effects of such changes in case definitions on other cities can be absorbed by time fixed effects. As robustness checks, we re-estimate models A and B without the cities in Hubei province. In addition, since the number of clinically diagnosed cases at the city level was reported for the days of February 12, 13, and 14, we recalculated the daily number of new cases for the 3 days by removing the clinically diagnosed cases from our data and re-estimate models A and B.

We then interact the flow index with the share that a destination city takes (Fig. 4) to construct a measure on the population flow from Wuhan to a destination city. Other mediating variables include population density, GDP per capita, and the number of doctors at the city level, which we collect from the most recent China city statistical yearbook.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, air pressure, average and maximum wind speeds, precipitation, snowfall amount, and dew point for 362 weather stations at the daily level in China. To merge the meteorological variables with the number of new cases of COVID-19, we first calculate daily weather variables for each city on each day from 2019 December to 2020 February from station-level weather records following the inverse distance weighting method. Specifically, for each city, we draw a circle of 100 km from the city\u2019s centroid and calculate the weighted average daily weather variables using stations within the 100-km circle12. We use the inverse of the distance between the city\u2019s centroid and each station as the weight. Second, we match the daily weather variables to the number of new cases of COVID-19 based on city name and date.\n",

Human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 is mostly through droplets and contacts (National Health Commission of the PRC 2020). Weather conditions such as rainfall, wind speed, and temperature may shape infections via their influences on social activities and virus transmissions. For instance, increased precipitation results in higher humidity, which may weaken virus transmissions (Lowen and Steel 2014). The virus may survive longer with lower temperature (Wang et al. 2020b; Puhani 2020). Greater wind speed and therefore ventilated air may decrease virus transmissions. In addition, increased rainfall and lower temperature may also reduce social activities. Newly confirmed COVID-19 cases typically arise from contracting the virus within 2 weeks in the past (e.g., World Health Organization 2020b). The extent of human-to-human transmission is determined by the number of people who have already contracted the virus and the environmental conditions within the next 2 weeks. Conditional on the number of people who are infectious and environmental conditions in the previous first and second weeks, it is plausible that weather conditions further in the past, i.e., in the previous third and fourth weeks, should not directly affect the number of current new cases. Based on the existing literature, we select weather characteristics as the instrumental variables, which include daily maximum temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and the interaction between precipitation and wind speed.",

After controlling for time-invariant city fixed effects and time effects that are common to all cities, on average, one new infection leads to 1.142 more cases in the next week, but 0.824 fewer cases 1 week later. The negative effect can be attributed to the fact that both local authorities and residents would have taken more protective measures in response to a higher perceived risk of contracting the virus given more time. Information disclosure on newly confirmed cases at the daily level by official media and information dissemination on social media throughout China may have promoted more timely actions by the public, resulting in slower virus transmissions. We then compare the transmission rates in different time windows. In the first sub-sample, one new infection leads to 2.135 more cases within a week, implying a fast growth in the number of cases. However, in the second sub-sample, the effect decreases to 1.077, suggesting that public health measures imposed in late January were effective in limiting a further spread of the virus.

In addition, geographic proximity may not fully describe the level of social interactions between residents in Wuhan and other cities since the lockdown in Wuhan on January 23 significantly reduced the population flow from Wuhan to other cities. To alleviate this concern, we also use a measure of the size of population flow from Wuhan to a destination city, which is constructed by multiplying the daily migration index on the population flow out of Wuhan (Fig 3) with the share of the flow that a destination city receives provided by Baidu (Fig. 4).

Besides, the transmission rate displays a slight increase beginning around February 4, which corresponds to the return travels and work resumption after Chinese Spring Festival, but eventually decreases at around February 12. Such decrease may be partly attributed to the social distancing strategies at the city level, so we examine the impacts of relevant policies in Section 5. Moreover, the transmission rates in cities outside Hubei province have been kept at low levels throughout the whole sample period (columns (4) and (6) of Table 5). These results suggest that the policies adopted at the national and provincial levels soon after January 19 prevented cities outside Hubei from becoming new hotspots of infections.

Interestingly, in the second sub-sample, population flow from Wuhan significantly decreases the transmission rate within 1 week, suggesting that people have been taking more cautious measures from high COVID-19 risk areas; however, more arrivals from Wuhan in the preceding second week can still be a risk. A back of the envelope calculation indicates that one new case in Wuhan leads to 0.064 (0.050) more cases in the destination city per 10,000 travelers from Wuhan within 1 (2) week between January 19 and February 1 (February 2 and February 29)15. Note that while the effect is statistically significant, it should be interpreted in context. It was estimated that 15,000,000 people would travel out of Wuhan during the Lunar New Year holiday16. If all had gone to one city, this would have directly generated about 171 cases within 2 weeks. The risk of infection is likely very low for most travelers except for few who have previous contacts with sources of infection, and person-specific history of past contacts may be an essential predictor for infection risk, in addition to the total number of population flows17.",

One standard deviation increase in the number of doctors reduces the transmission rate by 0.12. Cities with higher GDP per capita have higher transmission rates, which can be ascribed to the increased social interactions as economic activities increase18. In the second sub-sample, these effects become insignificant probably because public health measures and inter-city resource sharing take effects. In fact, cities with higher population density have lower transmission rates in the second sub-sample. Regarding the environmental factors, we notice different significant mediating variables across the first and second sub-samples. The transmission rates are lower with adverse weather conditions, lower temperature, or less rain. Further research is needed to identify clear mechanisms. In addition, population flow from Wuhan still poses a risk of new infections for other cities even after we account for the above mediating effects on own-city transmission. This effect is robust to the inclusion of the proximity measures based on economic similarity and geographic proximity between Wuhan and other cities. Nevertheless, we do not find much evidence on between-city transmissions among cities other than Wuhan.",

Our retrospective analysis of the data from China complements the simulation study of Ferguson et al. (2020). Our estimates indicate that suppressing local transmission rates at low levels might have avoided one million or more infections in China. Chinazzi et al. (2020) also find that reducing local transmission rates is necessary for effective containment of COVID-19. The public health policies announced by the national and provincial authorities in the last 2 weeks in January may have played a determinant role (Tian et al. 2020) in keeping local transmission rates in cities outside Hubei at low levels throughout January and February. Among the measures implemented following provincial level I responses, Shen et al. (2020) highlight the importance of contact tracing and isolation of close contacts before onset of symptoms in preventing a resurgence of infections once the COVID-19 suppression measures are relaxed. We also find that travel restrictions on high-risk areas (the lockdown in Wuhan), and to a lesser extent, closed management of communities and family outdoor restrictions, further reduce the number of cases. It should be noted that these factors may overlap in the real world. In the absence of the lockdown in Wuhan, the health care systems in cities outside Hubei could face much more pressure, and local transmissions may have been much higher. In China, the arrival of the COVID-19 epidemic coincided with the Lunar New Year for many cities.

Our sample is from January 19 to February 29 and covers key episodes such as the initial spread of the virus across China, the peak of infections in terms of domestic case counts, and the gradual containment of the virus in China. Changes in weather conditions induce exogenous variations in past infection rates, which allow us to identify the causal impact of past infections on new cases. The estimates suggest that the infectious effect of the existing cases is mostly observed within 1 week and people\u2019s responses can break the chain of infections. Comparing estimates in two sub-samples, we observe that the spread of COVID-19 has been effectively contained by mid February, especially for cities outside Hubei province. Data on real-time population flows between cities have become available in recent years. We show that this new source of data is valuable in explaining between-city transmissions of COVID-19, even after controlling for traditional measures of geographic and economic proximity.",

Cross border travel restrictions are imposed in order to reduce the risk of case importation. In areas with risks of community transmissions, public health measures such as social distancing, mandatory quarantine, and city lockdown are implemented. In a series of counterfactual simulations, we find that based on the experience in China, preventing sustained community transmissions from taking hold in the first place has the largest impact, followed by restricting population flows from areas with high risks of infections.
