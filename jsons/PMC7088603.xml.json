The genus Mastadenovirus includes viruses that infect mammals and usually cause mild or asymptomatic infections.

Later, the first AdV isolated from a microchiropteran bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) was reported in Germany and considered a novel ADV by partial sequencing [13]. To date, two full genomes of bat adenoviruses have been published (Bat AdV1 and 2) [7, 14]. However, many partial and phylogenetically distant genes corresponding to the AdV DNA polymerase sequences have been deposited in GenBank. These Mastadenovirus sequences were from viruses detected in European and Asian bats of the genera Hypsugo, Plecotus, Myotis, Nyctalus, Scotophilus, Pipistrellus, Hipposideros, Rousettus, Pteropus, and Rhinolophus.",

A rather limited number of studies have been conducted to reveal the role of vampire bats as reservoirs for other viruses [16]. In light of the potential participation of these animals in the maintenance and spread of other viruses in nature, such as adenoviruses, this study was conducted in an attempt to identify AdV DNA in tissue samples of Brazilian bats. This is the first detection of adenoviruses in D. rotundus, and it contributes to the knowledge on the role of this species as a reservoir of viruses in nature.",

Nucleotide sequences were aligned and compared to partial DNA polymerase gene from bat AdVs sequences available at GenBank database with the program ClustalX 2.0 [20]. Alignments were optimized with the BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor Program version 7.0.9 [21]. A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree was built with the deduced amino acid sequence from D. rotundus N5.1 DNA polymerase and homologous adenoviruses sequences detected in different animal species deposited in GenBank. Bootstrap values were determined by 2000 replicates to assess the confidence level of each branch pattern. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using MEGA5 [22].",

N5.1 and EAdV-1 share nucleotide and amino acid identities of 74.5 and 75.8 %, respectively. This relationship is particularly noteworthy, as a previous genetic characterization of EAdV-1 revealed a close relationship with Bat AdV TJM and Bat AdV2 PPV1, suggesting that they may have a common ancestor [25]. On the other hand, previous deposited AdV sequences obtained from different bat species share higher identities to Canine adenovirus 1 and 2, which are known to display an unusually broad host range (e.g., bears, wolves, raccoons, and sea lions) [11, 13].",

Such studies might be broadened and include other bat species considering the great variability of bats distributed in the country (about 140 species already identified) [15].",
