In the United States, there are 4 to 5 million cases of CAP annually, and approximately 25% require hospitalization [1] . Pneumonia is the seventh leading cause of death overall. It is the leading cause of death from an infectious etiology in the United States and carries a 14% mortality rate [1, 2] . Traditionally, the antibiotic management of patients with CAP and the selection of antibiotics have been straightforward. However, new pathogens have recently emerged that tend to complicate the management of patients with CAP. These new entities are: the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, human metapneumovirus, and community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). This review focuses on CA-MRSA and its impact on CAP.",

In the past, CA-MRSA was more prevalent in certain patients with predisposing conditions such as a history of chronic disease, intravenous drug abuse, recent surgery or hospitalization, or residency at a chronic care facility. Evidence in recent literature suggests that CA-MRSA now infects previously healthy patients without predisposing factors. A rise in the number of cases of CA-MRSA during the past 5 years has been documented in several studies [5,6\u2022,7\u2022\u2022,8] . A 2-year study performed in Memphis, TN showed that 46 of 122 MRSA isolates were due to CA-MRSA in the beginning of the study. During the final 12 months of the study, CA-MRSA was the cause of 106 of 167 MRSA-positive cultures [7\u2022\u2022] . Martinez-Aguilar et al. [9] examined all Staphylococcus-positive cultures from February 2000 to January 2002 and showed that the proportion of CA-MRSA increased from 35% to 67% of all isolates during this time period [9] . Similar results have been cited in many other cities in the United States, Europe, and Latin America.",

All MRSA strains are resistant to -lactam antibiotics including cephalosporins. Before the evolution of drug-resistant S. aureus, patients infected with S. aureus were treated with -lactam antibiotics. -lactam antibiotics bind to an enzyme on the cell wall of the bacteria called transpeptidase (PBP). PBP works by catalyzing the cross-linking of structural molecules in the bacterial cell wall. When -lactam antibiotics bind to PBP, this cross-linking is inhibited, resulting in a weaker cell wall, which eventually lyses [8] . S. aureus has evolved and acquired a new gene, the mecA gene. This gene sequence is located on a mobile genetic element known as the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec). The mecA gene codes for the penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP-2a), which is also expressed on the cell wall. However, -lactam antibiotics have a low affinity for PBP-2a, which results in a S. aureus strain insensitive to -lactam antibiotics, including cephalosporins [10] .",

Some reports have shown a decrease in the incidence of parapneumonic effusions since 2000, with a significant decrease in effusions caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. As effusions caused by Streptococcus have diminished, S. aureus has emerged as the most likely cause of effusion and empyema [5] . However, there is conflicting data. Other reports show an increase in the prevalence of complicated parapneumonic effusions. In a 10-year retrospective study conducted by Alfaro et al. [13] , an etiology for complicated pneumonia was found in 28 of the 54 enrolled patients. All of the Staphylococcus isolates were methicillin resistant and occurred in the final 2 years of the study, 2002 and 2003 [13] . These trends are similarly reported in patients with empyema. An analysis of 219 patients with empyema over a period of 10 years revealed that the prevalence of S. pneumoniae identified from pleural fluid culture decreased from 66% to 27% after universal pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. S. aureus was the most common pathogen isolated from patients in this study as well, with 78% of the S. aureus strains being methicillin resistant [6\u2022]. One report from Houston described a single clone of S. aureus responsible for more than 90% of CA-MRSA infections. From 2001 to 2003, they found a 65% increase in the number of patients diagnosed with empyema caused by CA-MRSA [12\u2022].",

Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) has been blamed for the invasive capability of CA-MRSA resulting in severe pneumonia, including necrotizing pneumonia. PVL is a toxin that causes lytic pores in the cell membranes of neutrophils, causing leukocyte destruction and the release of chemotactic factors that result in a massive inflammatory response [15] . This inflammatory response is the cause of tissue necrosis. In one report of CAP due to S. aureus carrying the PVL gene, six of eight patients died [16] . This toxin has been found in numerous patients who developed hemorrhagic pneumonia [10] , including a 16-month-old girl without risk factors who died from septicemia [17] . This toxin, as well as the enterotoxins B and C, have been isolated from CA-MRSA strains in Minnesota, Nebraska, and North Dakota. These toxins are super antigens, and have been responsible for at least four pediatric deaths from 1997 to 1999 [18] .",

Initial radiographic findings were also similar in both cohorts, but the PVL-positive group was more than twice as likely to develop infiltrates consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The 48-hour survival rate was 62.5% in the PVL-positive patients and 94% in the PVL-negative patients [19] . Another report describes a previously healthy 31-yearold man diagnosed with CAP who was treated with oral levofloxacin because of a 2-day history of fever, chills, nausea, and cough. The patient returned 15 hours later with shortness of breath and hemoptysis and was managed with vancomycin, other antibiotics, and inotropic support. The patient died 38 hours later and MRSA was identified in blood culture with resistance patterns consistent with community-acquired strains. Genotyping revealed the presence of the PVL gene [20] .",

S. aureus has been associated with severe illness and death in patients with influenza. Recently, cases of CA-MRSA-associated pneumonia have been reported in patients with flu-like symptoms. Influenza is believed to increase host susceptibility to Staphylococcal superinfection by reducing phagocytic killing of neutrophils and increasing adhesion to the respiratory tract [21] . In one recent review of 17 cases of influenza-like illness complicated with S. aureus pneumonia during the 2003 to 2004 influenza season, 88% of the patients had CA-MRSA CAP. A PVL gene was detected in 85% of isolates, and 80% of all deaths were due to CA-MRSA. All the isolates were resistant to macrolides, and one half were resistant to fluoroquinolones. The authors concluded that management of pneumonia during or following an influenza season should include antimicrobial coverage for MRSA [22] .",

Opponents of vancomycin argue that tissue levels of vancomycin above minimum inhibitory concentration are far more predictive of clinical outcome. Therefore, they recommend a continuous infusion of vancomycin with the goal of maintaining blood levels that are greater than 20 \u03bcm/mL in an attempt to maintain adequate tissue levels of vancomycin [23, 24] . Recent data also suggest that vancomycin may not be the optimal antibiotic due to poor tissue penetration. Cruciani et al. [25] measured vancomycin concentrations in lung tissue and blood at 1 and 12 hours in 30 patients with pleural effusions and demonstrated that the vancomycin level in the lungs was subtherapeutic despite adequate serum vancomycin levels. In a series of patients, Gonzalez et al. [17] demonstrated that patients with MSSA pneumonia who were treated with vancomycin had a higher mortality rate, 47% versus 0% in the cloxacillin cohort [17] . A case series of three patients published by Rello et al. [23] found positive MRSA growth in postmortem cultures despite vancomycin therapy. Alternatively, other authors have shown that the concentration of linezolid is higher in lung epithelial lining at 2, 4, 6, 10, and 12 hours when compared to blood [26, 27] . These data suggest that vancomycin may not be the ideal antibiotic choice for pneumonia caused by CA-MRSA.",

One retrospective study examined 46 patients with invasive CA-MRSA infections who were managed with clindamycin, vancomycin, or -lactam antibiotics. All 39 patients who were treated with clindamycin had complete or substantial improvement [9] . If clindamycin is chosen as therapy, the erythromycin induction test (D-test) should be performed on MRSA isolates to check for the presence of inducible resistance. The presence of clindamycin resistance in different communities varies widely. Data from Texas showed that 83% of CA-MRSA isolates were resistant to erythromycin, but inducible clindamycin resistance was found in only 2.2% of strains [9] . However, other areas such as Chicago and Minnesota have reported positive D-tests in over 85% of isolates [27, 28] .",

We suggest managing patients who are diagnosed with pleural effusions, empyema, or other forms of complicated pneumonia with antibiotics targeted at CA-MRSA. Other circumstances where suspicion for CA-MRSA should be heightened include young patients or critically ill patients with pneumonia, or patients who have pneumonia associated with influenza.
