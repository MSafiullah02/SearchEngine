So CoreCLR loads system libraries (DLLs) using mmap system call. Then those libraries may be shared between the applications. These DLLs are read-only, but they can be compiled to native images. Native images contain relocations, i.e. data or code, which rely on the actual starting memory address of mmapped file. This data or code should be updated at DLL load time, creating process specific copies of memory pages. The idea of optimization is to reduce number of such relocations making memory pages position independent and read only and, thus, shared between processes. This has been performed for various parts of native images and reduced CoreCLR Private memory consumption of each process by 45% (3 Mb) in average.",

The other one (arena allocator) is used by JIT during compilation and never frees its memory by default. This behavior was changed to basically the same malloc/free and also had no negative effect on performance.
