The common cold is generally not life threatening and usually resolves without medical intervention. As it is caused by a group of highly contagious airborne viruses for which no vaccine is available, the best protection is to avoid close proximity to individuals who are infected. By contrast, influenza results in many fatalities, particularly in the elderly and in individuals with suppressed immune systems. Annually modified influenza vaccines available in the western world were initially offered to individuals at risk but are now available to everyone. However, it should be noted that 87 \u2018The influenza vaccine was only 62% effective among people who did not receive influenza vaccination in the prior year. In comparison, vaccine effectiveness among those who did get influenza vaccination in the previous year was substantially lower.\u2019 Occasionally, a new influenza variant may cause a pandemic as a result of zoonosis (i.e. transmission of an animal flu virus to humans) or \u2018genetic recombination\u2019 (more precisely, reassortment of gene segments) of a human virus with a nonhuman form that crosses species. Well\u2010known recent examples of these are swine flu and avian or bird flu, which is sometimes confused with the zoonotic severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (a corona virus).",

The most successful example of a human\u2010driven eradication is that of the smallpox virus following implementation of a worldwide vaccination strategy. This approach succeeded because the smallpox virus (variola) is essentially comprised of a single strain and does not have an animal vector. The approach to measles is another example demonstrating the success of vaccines. Measles is a highly contagious infection of the respiratory system that spreads through aerosol transmission or contact with nasal and oral fluids. Effective vaccines are available and in the USA measles was declared eliminated in 2000. In 2010, at the 63rd World Health Assembly, a global goal was proposed to eliminate the disease with a target of a 95% reduction in mortality by 2015. Unfortunately, there has been a recent measles outbreak in the USA (288 cases), mostly in unvaccinated individuals (http://www.CDC.gov/measles/).",

Ultimately, a cultivation confirmatory test may be needed to obtain a definitive diagnosis.

In contrast to serum or plasma, there is no standard protocol for saliva/oral fluid collection and thus saliva may refer to whole\u2010mouth stimulated or unstimulated saliva or to a sample obtained with an oral swab or brush. Filtered or centrifuged saliva can be used to detect free virus, but the virus may be free or cell\u2010bound when using whole saliva or oral swabs. Not all viruses are easily cultivated, and in contrast to bacteria they cannot be directly grown in culture media, but require specific living cells to support their replication. Human papillomavirus, hepatitis C virus, herpes simplex virus, human herpesvirus 8, coronaviruses and the rhinoviruses are examples of viruses known to be difficult to culture. Determining the presence of viable virus in oral fluid samples does not always indicate that the virus can be transmitted orally. In the case of cytomegalovirus, a member of the Herpesviridae family, it is known that transmission occurs via direct contact with body fluids. Although serology suggests a prevalence of cytomegalovirus of up to 80%, blood donors are not routinely tested for active cytomegalovirus infections because the virus in blood is cell associated and leucocyte\u2010depleted red\u2010blood\u2010cell products are considered cytomegalovirus safe. However, the situation in saliva is probably different. The cytomegalovirus transmission route through saliva is similar to that following infection with Epstein\u2013Barr virus, a Herpesviridae member responsible for causing infectious mononucleosis (\u2018kissing disease\u2019) and oral hairy leukoplakia.",

Besides the currently widely utilized viral nucleic acid\u2010based detection methods, immunologic\u2010based diagnostics of pathogen\u2010derived antigens are also used to demonstrate active infection. For example, detection of hepatitis B surface antigen is a common test amenable for salivary diagnosis 5 of hepatitis B virus. Other antigen assays demonstrating active viral infections using oral samples have been described for ebola 44, rabies 72 and HIV 62, 86. Pathogen\u2010derived antigens (e.g. p24 for HIV) are often present at higher levels than the viral genome, and identifying such abundant viral proteins (>1,000 copies per virion) often utilizes the simpler technique of detection of unbound/free soluble protein rather than viral nucleic acid amplification. After seroconversion, effective testing for the presence of viral antigens is best achieved by including an immune\u2010complex dissociation step. In HIV infection, p24 testing was proposed as a method to detect acute infections, within the seroconversion window. In August 2013, the first rapid test detecting HIV\u20101 antigen and HIV\u20101/2 antibodies was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for over\u2010the\u2010counter sales. The Determine HIV\u20101/2 antigen/antibody Combo test (Alere Inc., Orlando, FL, USA) is used by trained professionals and is well suited for outreach settings where access to health care is limited. However, the antigen/antibody Combo test does not replace viral nucleic acid confirmatory testing and is not approved for blood\u2010donor screening. Multiple\u2010test algorithms designed for validation of antibody\u2010only tests still apply to the Combo test, even when the test indicates the presence of both anti\u2010HIV immunoglobulins and HIV p24 antigen. The use of lower\u2010complexity and less\u2010expensive p24 tests as alternatives to viral nucleic acid\u2010based viral load testing to validate serological assays is thought to be limited 97 as these antigen tests show poor clinical sensitivity once the viral load drops below 30,000 virions/ml; note that a good correlation between p24 and viral RNA is only seen within the seroconversion window.",

Such devices are feasible with the currently available viral nucleic acid\u2010amplification technology; however, cost and sample\u2010preparation issues still need to be addressed 45, 71. Recent technological advances have allowed analysis by deep sequencing of the human salivary microbiome to create a catalog of all the microorganisms present in saliva and oral mucosa. Analysis of the salivary virome 94, the virus subset of the salivary microbiome, demonstrated that the majority of oral viruses are bacteriophages. It is postulated that because these phages require bacterial cells for replication they probably play an important role in the microbial diversity and health of the oral cavity and may also influence the susceptibility to human viral infections. Optimization of oral fluid viral nucleic acid\u2010isolation methods, combined with the availability of high\u2010throughput sequencing and analysis technologies, will provide useful tools to identify known, as well as unknown, viruses 24.",

Antibody screening is useful for epidemiological studies and for monitoring a large population for immunity to common viral infections, whereas the screening of young children for the presence of antibodies against infectious agents thought to be eliminated can be useful to monitor potential re\u2010emergence of a pathogen. Using saliva as a clinical sample for this (large\u2010scale) approach is cost\u2010effective because samples can be collected noninvasively by the participants themselves at home and mailed to a national test laboratory 81, 85. It is widely accepted that any antibody detectable in blood can also be detected in saliva. However, there are fluctuations and differences in concentration because salivary flow rates vary with circadian rhythm and saliva composition is more variable than that of blood/plasma. Moreover, the antibody isotype differs; salivary glands produce and secrete salivary IgA, whereas IgG and IgM enter the oral cavity through leakage from the bloodstream and gingival crevicular fluid and are present at lower concentrations. Another issue in studies utilizing oral samples is the method of collection; for example, with respect to antibody type, the composition of whole saliva is quite different from the composition of gingival crevicular fluid, which is a transudate that more closely resembles blood. For antibody detection, as a consequence of the high abundancy after seroconversion, the collection method is less critical than is the case when targeting pathogen\u2010derived analytes, such as nucleic acids. In previous studies 22, 67 exploring the development of a modular microfluidic test device for multiplex analysis of saliva samples, a versatile generic antibody assay [Fig. 1\n22, 29, 31, 32] was evaluated using two sets of saliva samples collected using different protocols. Set 1 [WIHS, obtained from the Woman's Interagency HIV Study 10] comprised samples, which, upon collection, were immediately stored in a preservative, whereas set 2 (UO1, samples collected during a study funded by National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIH grant UO1DE017855) comprised samples, which, upon collection, were clarified using the saliva\u2010collection sponge from the UPlink collector 73. From both sets, paired serum and saliva samples were tested in parallel to validate saliva results.",

Typically the pathogen is transferred amongst individuals in close contact, including locations such as hospitals, cruise ships and airlines, as well as by food handlers. The virus can survive for days in water and only extremely small doses need to be transferred to the hands/mouth from contaminated surfaces (e.g. doorknobs, bed sheets, ceramic surfaces) to transmit the infection. The virus is relatively resistant to common disinfectants, thus increasing the risk of transmission.

It is suggested that spelunkers may become infected after inhalation of aerosols from bat colonies hanging upside down in caves. The disease is most prevalent in areas with endemic dog rabies or infected bats. The virus binds to nicotinic receptors on muscle fibers of a newly infected animal and then migrates via nerves to the brain, where it replicates and spreads via neuronal routes to the salivary gland and ultimately appears in saliva. When the rabies\u2010infected animal bites a human, the spread once again is to the central nervous system and subsequently virus is found in the saliva of the human host. Rabies antigens and antibodies can be detected in saliva of both infected animals and humans, but this is typically late in the infection, making serological detection of little practical value. PCR detection of rabies virus in saliva has been reported 36. Appropriate pre\u2010exposure (vaccine) and postexposure prophylaxis (rabies immune globulin and vaccine) can be effective with early treatment along with antiviral drugs, otherwise the disease is typically fatal 127.

It is a lymphocryptovirus targeting B\u2010cells and epithelial cells and is also referred to as human herpesvirus 4. This orally transmitted virus is one of the most common viruses, with a worldwide infection rate of over 90% of the adult population. Although exposure to the virus is high, most primary infections are asymptomatic. However, long\u2010term carriage is associated with epithelial\u2010cell malignancies, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma and oral hairy leukoplakia, and may play a role in many other benign and malignant diseases 56. Oral hairy leukoplakia is often a consequence of an opportunistic infection of Epstein\u2013Barr virus in HIV\u2010infected individuals.",

However, most frequently, transmission is thought to occur through saliva. The virus can survive on objects and surfaces as long as they stay moist and thus can be easily transmitted (e.g. by sharing drinks). There is no vaccine available to prevent infection. Epstein\u2013Barr virus is the cause of the majority of infectious mononucleosis cases (also known as Pfeiffer or the Kissing Disease), common among young adults and teenagers. Infection may cause fatigue and malaise, from which it may take several months to recover 35. When clinical symptoms indicate mononucleosis\u2010like symptoms, infectious mononucleosis can be confirmed by the presence of atypical lymphocytes and serological tests. In the past, serological diagnostic tests detected the presence of heterophile antibodies (weak antibodies with multispecific activity against poorly defined antigens). Epidemiological studies, using the detection of specific antibodies in saliva to determine population immunity, have been reported 37. Currently, more sensitive IgG (reflecting past infection) and IgM (reflecting current infection) diagnostics have been developed that reduce the false\u2010negative rate and thus rule out infectious mononucleosis. Previously, the presence of infectious Epstein\u2013Barr virus in saliva was demonstrated by the ability of saliva extracts to transform lymphocytes in culture. Now, nucleic acid\u2010based detection is the most sensitive standard method for detecting infections 61, 110.",

The antibody test is specific to the type of herpes simplex virus and, like nucleic acid testing, can distinguish between herpes simplex virus 1 and herpes simplex virus 2. One of the first reports showing the presence of herpes simplex virus 1\u2010specific IgA antibodies in saliva was published in in 1984 101 and demonstrated elevated herpes simplex virus 1\u2010specific IgA levels in patients with peptic ulcer. The current dogma is that herpes simplex virus 1 is frequently found in upper gastrointestinal tract ulcers but not in normal gastric and duodenal mucosa, where ulcers are linked to infection with Helicobacter pylori. IgA present in saliva can block the infectivity of herpes simplex virus, as demonstrated in vitro, but the efficiency of viral neutralization in vivo is still unknown. Viable herpes simplex virus can be isolated from saliva, but current methods utilize viral nucleic acid detection, although this is not a quantitative measure of infectious virions. In 1994, Tateishi et al. 117 demonstrated that nucleic acid detection is the most sensitive method for determining herpes simplex virus 1 infection. Rapid antibody tests have been developed for use with blood samples, and modifying the existing rapid tests for detection of antibody in oral fluid would appear to be straightforward. An over\u2010the\u2010counter rapid test would primarily serve to reassure an individual of the absence of herpes simplex virus infection. Whether a rapid test based on the detection of viral antigen or viral nucleic acid in saliva would be useful is a matter of debate because localized sampling of a lesion for diagnosis of genital herpes is available. The situation for viral infections of hepatitis C virus and HIV is clearly different (see below).",

Since then, rapid testing using saliva has evolved 131 to a rapid test that requires only 20 min from \u2018sample to result\u2019 66. The latter, low\u2010complexity, user\u2010friendly test was built on the same platform as the OraQuick Advance HIV1/2 Rapid Test. Although the hepatitis C virus test device may become FDA approved to determine the presence of antibodies in oral samples in the future, a confirmatory test to determine an active infection will still be needed. As hepatitis C virus transmission requires blood\u2013blood contact, it was proposed that a saliva\u2010based diagnostic might be safer than blood for testing. Infectious hepatitis C virus in saliva has been observed, but generally only for individuals with periodontal disease or gingivitis and a serum viral load higher than 106 virions/ml. Infection through salivary contact is unlikely, but cannot be fully excluded.",

            "text": "The three main transmission routes of HIV infection are unprotected sexual intercourse, the use of contaminated needles and transmission from mother to child during pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding. The role of saliva in both the diagnosis and inhibition of HIV has been a widely discussed topic (for reviews see Page\u2010Shafer et al. and Shiboski et al. 89, 103). The presence of viable HIV particles in saliva is controversial 11, 105. Detection of HIV nucleic acids in saliva has been demonstrated, but it is not clear whether the viral RNA detected is derived from viable viral particles or instead represents free nucleic acid fragments. In general, the viral loads in saliva are lower than those in the corresponding blood sample 46. Occasionally, high secretors of HIV have been reported, perhaps indicating the presence of reservoirs for HIV in salivary glands or oropharyngeal tissue. Infected lymphocytes from various oral sources are a possible source of HIV in viral hypersecretors 106. It is important to recognize the presence of reservoirs as a potential source of transmission. Thousand\u2010fold higher viral RNA levels have been reported in tonsil biopsies than in the corresponding blood samples 43. Even more remarkable is the detection of 107 HIV copies per ml in parotid cyst aspirates in individuals with undetectable blood viremia 120. Although the presence of reservoirs is acknowledged and the existence of HIV in epithelial cells of the buccal mucosa has been demonstrated 40, 79, saliva is not regarded as a relevant transmission route 88. Saliva lyses HIV particles in vitro because of its hypotonicity 11 and many salivary proteins have been demonstrated to inhibit HIV infectivity in vitro, including lysozyme, cysteine\u2010rich defensins, lactoferrin, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor and salivary agglutinin (gp340, DMBT1). In the oral cavity, soluble gp340 is thought to inactivate HIV by a mechanism involving binding to a HIV glycoprotein (gp120) exposed on the HIV envelope 74, 83.",

The innate immune system present in the mouth can prevent some infections (e.g. HIV), whereas other viruses, including rabies, herpes simplex virus and Epstein\u2013Barr virus, can infect and be transmitted orally. Of particular importance is that defensive antibodies to most bacterial and viral pathogens can be detected using saliva or a swab of the oral mucosa. The frequency of oral\u2010based testing for viral and bacterial diseases is increasing as more commercial entities become involved and new products are being developed. The major advantages of oral\u2010based testing are cost, patient acceptance, equivalence to blood testing and the possibility of home testing. Whether increased testing for viral infections should be recommended depends on several factors, of which cost is extremely important. Inexpensive and rapid saliva diagnostics can be used in a dental office to provide screening tests for many viral diseases, including HIV, hepatitis C virus and influenza \u2013 in fact, all situations where a blood\u2010based antibody test is performed. Moreover, when oral symptoms suggest, or when requested by the patient, the dentist could conveniently initiate viral nucleic acid\u2010based testing by collection of the appropriate oral sample to send to a central laboratory for further analysis and inform the patient's physician for follow up. Alternatively, the rapid oral antibody test could be performed in the dentist's office and, if the screening result is reactive, the patient can be referred immediately to a clinic for a confirmatory test.",
