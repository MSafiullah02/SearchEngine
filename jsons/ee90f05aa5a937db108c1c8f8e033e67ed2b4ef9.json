We consider four representative settings of social contacts that may cause the disease spread: (1) individual households; (2) schools, including primary/high schools as well as colleges and universities; (3) various physical workplaces; and (4) public places and communities where people can gather, such as stadiums, markets, squares, and organized tours. A contact matrix is computed to describe the contact intensity between different age-groups for each of the four settings. By integrating the four contact matrices with the next-generation matrix, we quantitatively characterize the underlying transmission patterns of COVID-19 among different populations.",

The results show that the social contact-based analysis can readily explain the underlying disease transmission patterns as well as the associated risks (including both confirmed and unconfirmed cases). In Wuhan, the age-groups involving relatively intensive contacts in households and public/communities are dispersedly distributed. This can explain why the transmission of COVID-19 in the early stage mainly took place in public places and families in Wuhan. We estimate that Feb. 11, 2020 was the date with the highest transmission risk in Wuhan, which is consistent with the actual peak period of the reported case number (Feb. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Moreover, the surge in the number of new cases reported on Feb. 12-13 in Wuhan can readily be captured using our model, showing its ability in forecasting the potential/unconfirmed cases. We further estimate the disease transmission risks associated with different work resumption plans in these cities after the outbreak. The estimation results are consistent with the actual situations in the cities with relatively lenient control policies, such as Beijing, and those with strict control policies, such as Shenzhen.",

To address this challenging issue in a fundamental way, we examine an essential factor that characterizes the disease transmission patterns: the interactions among people. 20, 21 Specifically, we examine the interactions in terms of the social contact patterns among the population of different age-groups. To characterize the age-specific social contact-based transmission, we divide a city's population into seven age-groups: 0-6 years old (children); 7-14 (primary and junior high school students); 15-17 (high school students); 18-22 (university and college students); 23-44 (young/middleaged people); 45-64 years old (middle-aged/elderly people); and 65 or above (elderly people). The population in each of the seven groups has its own specific social circles, gathering places, or activity patterns. Meanwhile, we consider four representative settings of social contacts that may cause the disease spread: (1) individual households, which may lead to the transmission within families; (2) schools, including primary/high schools as well as colleges and universities, which may cause the spread among students and teachers; (3) various physical workplaces, which may affect in-office and outside workers; and (4) public places and communities, such as stadiums, markets, squares, and organized tours, where the spread within a dense population may arise.",

The i-th element in vector I t denotes the number of infectious individuals in G i at the t-th generation of the disease infection. By referring to Li et al.'s work, 6 we set the reproduction number R 0 = 2.2. For the recovery rate \u03b3, we calculate it as follows: First, according to the definition of recovery rate, 25 it is the reciprocal of the duration of being 8 infectious (i.e., \u03b3 = 1/infectious period). Then, according to Svensson's work, 26 7 indicates that the mean incubation period is 5.2 days for COVID-19. As there is not precise infection date for those patients to estimate the mean latent period, we use the mean incubation period to approximate the mean latent period. Therefore, the recovery rate is estimated as \u03b3 = 1/(7.5-5.2). For the infectivity, we set a ii = 1.0 (for i = 1, \u2026, 7) according to Xia et al.'s work. 21 For the susceptibility b ii , as it represents the probability of being infected when a susceptible individual is exposed to infectious contacts, we estimate it as follows: For each G i , we first calculate its infected population ratio r i by dividing the number of infected cases in G i by P i , i.e., r i = n i /P i . With r i calculated for all 7 age-groups, we then obtain a multiplier, 1/min{r 1 , \u2026, r 7 }, through normalizing the smallest r i to 1, and inflate all other infected population ratios by 1/min{r 1 , \u2026, r 7 }. Then we estimate the susceptibility as b ii = r i /min{r 1 , \u2026, r 7 }. As different cities have different numbers of infected cases and different population sizes, they Similarly, if we consider different work resumption plans, we will need to increase these weights proportional to the rate of work resumption. Specifically, we reduce r W from its original value to 0 as of Jan. 23 (the starting date of implementing stringent public health control policies). Moreover, we gradually recover its value from the starting date of our work resumption plans to reflect the effect of \"back-to-work\" policies. We apply the similar rationale to r S and r P . For r H , as the public social distancing policies would increase social contacts within households, we increase the value of r H starting from Jan. 23, and gradually reduce to its original value once the \"back-to-work\" policy kicks in.",

This is consistent with the observation that the transmission of COVID-19 in the early stage mainly took place in public places and families. In contrast, the distribution of age-groups with intensive contacts in schools and workplaces are relatively concentrated. Moreover, the composition of people in these two settings is relatively stable, making the management easier than that in public places or communities. Because most of the schools and workplaces were closed before the Chinese Spring Festival and have not been reopened or resumed yet, the scale of the COVID-19 outbreak in these two settings is relatively limited. However, if normal educational and economic activities are to be resumed, a large number of students and staff will gather in these two settings, which may bring a real challenge to the control and prevention of COVID-19 infection in these concerned places.

To model the potential local transmission risk caused by the imported cases, we use the following approach: First, for each confirmed case, we identify if it is imported or indigenous according to the information provided by the Municipal Health Commission [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . If the case is an imported case, we consider its potential risk in bringing in local transmission. According to Li et al.'s results, 6 the mean serial interval is 7.5 days, so we assume that for each imported case, from the day of arrival to the day of hospitalization, he/she could infect 1/7.5 person per day. We apply the same principle to all imported cases to estimate their potential infections. Those cases infected by the imported ones are considered as potential cases in our study.

The trends in Figure 4 are measured by the total number of confirmed cases. From Figure 4(A) we can observe that the disease trends in all six cities are relatively sensitive to the variations in the infectivity in G5 and G6 (45-64). There are two main reasons. First, both the population size and the case number in these two age-groups are relatively large. Second, people in these two groups are more frequently engaged in social activities than those in other age-groups. Therefore, a slight variation on the infectivity in these two groups might cause relatively large variations in the disease trends. FromFigure 4(B) we can observe that the variations of the disease trends are more obvious in households than in schools, workplaces, and public places/communities, which is consistent with our observations inFigure 2. The reason is that China has already implemented strong social distancing strategies, such as the closure of schools and workplaces, and thus the variations of social contact intensities in schools and workplaces have relatively limited impact on the disease trends. Note that even various intervention strategies have been deployed, the disease trends can still be relatively sensitive to the variations of social contact intensities in public places and communities. The key implication, as revealed byFigure 4(B), is to maintain proper social distance in public/community, even when school and business activities are resumed. Moreover, there are some intrinsic consistencies between the results in Figures 4(A) and 4(B). Note that the group in Figures 4(A) with the highest sensitivity is G5, in the age of 23-44. People of this age are generally the family breadwinner and play the most active role in social activities. If they are infected, they will bring a huge risk to their family members in households and their friends and acquaintances in communities. This explains the observation in Figures 4(A), i.e., the variation of infectivity in G5 brings the highest impact on the disease trends, and thus reminds the public health workers to pay special attention to this group of population when implementing control and prevention strategies in a later stage. Discussion In this study, we demonstrated the importance of characterizing the underlying transmission patterns among different populations for the purpose of understanding the COVID-19 outbreak in China from an epidemiological perspective. With an in-depth characterization of the age-specific social contactbased transmission, we conducted the retrospective and prospective analyses of the disease outbreak, including the past and future disease transmission trends, the effectiveness of different interventions, and the disease transmission risks of restoring normal social activities. We focused on 6 representative cities in China; the conclusions drawn from the study not only provide a comprehensive explanation of the underlying COVID-19 transmission patterns in China, but more importantly, offer the contactbased risk analysis methodology that can readily be applied to guide intervention planning and operational responses in other countries, who are currently under high risks, so as to effectively control the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, the analysis is conducted on 6 cities in China, including Wuhan, Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Shenzhen. On the one hand, the selected cities are representative in terms of the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak in the respective region during the time that the study was conducted and their economic impact in China. On the other hand, they have presented different characteristics in several important aspects: First, the categories of confirmed cases in these cities are different. For Wuhan, most of the cases are indigenous cases; while in the other 5 cities, a large portion of the cases is imported cases (from Hubei Province). Second, the distributions of populations in different age-groups are different in these cities. Third, the levels of social distancing interventions and the work resumption plans implemented in different cities are different. The above differences make the scenarios in different cities quite different and intriguing. The retrospective and prospective analyses conducted on these cities show that our results are consistent with the real situations of the corresponding cities, validating the model's generalization ability given different real-world contexts.",
