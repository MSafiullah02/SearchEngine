The dominant paradigm, wherein multiple genetic lesions, e.g. of the cyclinD/cdk4-p16INK4A-pRb-pathway [3], [4], provide both the impetus for and the possible Achilles heel of cancer, which in return can be targeted for gene therapy [5], is not sufficient to understand melanoma as a disease process. Furthermore, some of the genetic lesions frequently encountered in other solid tumors, e.g. alterations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene product, are apparently not of relevance in the evolution of melanoma [6], [7]. Considering that 2% of the gene products of organisms, whose genome has been sequenced are proteases [8], many exciting discoveries about the functions of these molecules in physiological and neoplastic processes can be expected in the future. In the following review, we will use selected examples to illustrate the influence of cell-surface proteolysis and the resulting alteration of the pericellular microenvironment for the evolution of melanoma.",

Keratinocytes, the \u2018masters\u2019, dictate when the melanocytes, the \u2018slaves\u2019, can grow and what cell-surface molecules are expressed [11], [12]. The keratinocytes need cell-cell contact to establish this control, which is mediated by E-cadherin. E-cadherin is found on normal melanocytes and to a lesser degree on nevi and little on melanomas (Fig. 2) [13]. The loss of E-cadherin expression has significant biological consequences in melanocytic cells. Melanoma cells have escaped from keratinocyte control by shutting off expression of E-cadherin and activating N-cadherin [14]. They can now leave the epidermis, invade the dermis and closely adhere to and communicate with fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and other stromal cells and components. The \u2018run-away\u2019 slave has become a powerful \u2018master\u2019, accepting growth factors from keratinocytes; it now directs the presence and functions of fibroblasts, endothelial and inflammatory cells in its microenvironment. The melanoma cells tell the fibroblasts to produce a scaffolding with matrix proteins, and to release growth factors, which melanomas cannot synthesize on their own, but which increase their growth, survival and invasive capacity [15]. The symbiosis has been reversed and the malignant melanoma cells are in the driver's seat.",

Forced reexpression of E-cadherin in melanoma cells leads to growth retardation, inhibition of invasion and induction of apoptotic death in three-dimensional skin reconstructs, and decreased tumorigenicity in mice [14]. Thus, E-cadherin may act as an invasion suppressor in the melanoma system. Melanoma cells, even the most aggressive metastatic ones, can again come under the control of keratinocytes, if the expression of E-cadherin is re-established by gene transfer [16]. The N-cadherin gene is then downregulated and the melanoma cells no longer establish gap junctions with fibroblasts [14]. The keratinocytes are again in the driver's seat: They can adhere to the E-cadherin expressing melanoma cells and dictate whether these grow or not [16]. Within a few days, all melanoma cell surface molecules associated with growth, invasion and metastasis are shut off. Important markers are the \u03b23 integrin subunit that allows biologically early melanoma cells to invade into the dermis [17], [18], and the cell-cell adhesion marker Mel-CAM/MUC18 [12], [18]. We do not know the mechanisms, by which keratinocytes can transmit their signals, but these signal are strong enough to force the melanoma cells back into a subservient position.",

This contact, in turn, facilitates formation of gap junctions through connexin 43 [14]. It remains unclear, whether signals for phenotypic control over melanocytes are relayed through E-cadherin, gap junctions or other accessory mechanisms. Nevertheless, E-cadherin downregulation coincides with melanoma progression. Reduced E-cadherin expression can be observed early in the nevus stage and the majority of melanomas are E-cadherin negative [13].",

Acquisition of N-cadherin may allow gap junctional communication of nevus and melanoma cells with N-cadherin-expressing fibroblasts and endothelial cells [15]. Genetic changes are anticipated when dysplastic nevi develop, but the nature of these changes is currently unknown. It is possible that mechanisms leading to persistence and proliferation of dysplastic nevi rest in the dysfunction of the physiological cascade of apoptosis. Progression from dysplasia to RGP primary melanoma is gradual and spontaneous, and may not require additional molecular changes [15]. The transition from RGP to VGP is a biologically and clinically critical step, accompanying additional genetic abnormalities. However, the specifics are largely unknown. In sections of lesions and in cultured cells, we have described a variety of changes at the biological level, which explain RGP to VGP progression [24].",

In addition, VGP cells are less dependent on exogenous growth factors [26] and have growth characteristics similar to metastatic cells, such as anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and tumorigenesis in immunodeficient mice. VGP primary melanomas display numerous cytogenetic abnormalities, suggesting considerable genomic instability. No major additional genetic changes may be required for further progression to metastatic dissemination since most VGP melanomas can be readily adapted to a metastatic phenotype through selection in growth factor-free medium or by induction of invasion through artificial basement membranes [27]. This suggests that micro-environmental factors, such as cell\u2013matrix and cell\u2013cell signaling are critical for the metastatic phenotype.",

In a step towards functionally categorizing these genetic changes, Kinzler and Vogelstein have classified the genes involved, as those that monitor growth by suppressing proliferation, inducing apoptosis or promoting differentiation (\u2018gatekeepers\u2019). These are assisted by genes that indirectly suppress neoplasia by ensuring the fidelity of the DNA code through effective repair of DNA damge or by regulating genomic stability (\u2018caretakers\u2019) [29]. Recently they have also recognized enabling genes (\u2018landscapers\u2019) [30], which might affect non-target cells by modulating the microenvironment, in which tumor cells grow, perhaps by direct/indirect regulation of extracellular matrix proteins, cell-surface markers, adhesion proteins, or secreted growth factors [31].

DPPIV has also been called adenosine deaminase binding protein or adenosine deaminase complexing protein [54]. Chemokines are potential substrates for DPPIV [55], including RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted) and monocyte chemotactic proteins (MCP) 1, -2, and -3 [56], [57], [58] (Table 2). DPPIV expression on T cells has been designated CD26 [42], [51]. DPPIV is also expressed on epithelia and melanocytes [42], [51], [52]. It has long been recognized that expression of DPPIV can be downregulated or altered on cancer cells [59], [60]. Specifically, loss or alteration of membrane expression of DPPIV has been reported in prostate [40], [61], colorectal [62], [63], gastric [62], lung [60], and hepatocellular [60] carcinomas and melanomas [52]. In addition, DPPIV is involved in the fibronectin (FN)-mediated adherence of metastatic breast cancer cells to lung endothelium, in which case DPPIV is expressed on the endothelial cells and FN is expressed on the cell surfaces of the malignant cells [64].",

A series of work by Houghton and colleagues has shown that DPPIV is expressed in vitro and in vivo by normal melanocytes, but not by melanoma [52], [65]. Loss of DPPIV expression probably occurs at an early stage of melanoma progression, when melanocytes transform into melanoma cells [52]. More specifically, DPPIV is expressed by cutaneous melanocytes and common nevi, but is not detected in vivo or in vitro on cells from primary or metastatic melanomas. In an in vitro system that sequentially transformed melanocytes in defined steps, loss of DPPIV expression occurred concomitantly with the emergence of growth factor independence [65], [66]. More recently, the re-expression of DPPIV in human melanoma cells at levels comparable with those found in normal melanocytes has been shown to produce profound phenotypic changes [67]. These included abrogation of tumorigenicity, re-emergence of requirements for exogenous growth factors to maintain cell survival, and removal of a block in cell differentiation. Using a point mutation in the active serine protease domain of DPPIV, the authors also observed that serine peptidase activity was required for most effects but not for cell survival. Re-expression of DPPIV rescued expression of a second putative surface peptidase, fibroblast activation protein (FAP/seprase; see below) [68], [69], suggesting that expression of this second molecule contributes to effects on cell survival in malignant cells.",

            "text": "In contrast to DPPIV, APN is not expressed by normal melanocytes, but becomes increasingly prevalent as melanocytes transform to dysplastic nevocytes and malignant melanoma cells [70], [71]. When melanoma cells form colonies, the majority of APN molecules relocate to sites of cell\u2013cell contact; in those cells, APN seems to be tightly associated with ECM components [70]. APN has a direct role in melanoma cell invasion and ECM degradation [50]. Betastatin, a competitive inhibitor of APN function, as well as antibodies to APN, inhibit the penetration of melanoma cells through an artificial basement membrane in vitro without affecting cell adhesion or cell growth [50], [70]. Thus, the expression of APN is thought to play a critical role as one member of a cascade of enzymes that hydrolyse extracellular matrix proteins [50], [70]. APN may serve as an activator of type IV collagenase and other matrix proteins by cleaving N-terminal amino acids (Fig. 3), thereby allowing the acquisition of invasive and metastatic competence [50], [72]. Interestingly, APN was shown to be the major receptor for the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [73] that causes severe gastroenteritis in piglets, and for the human coronavirus 229E [74] that causes upper respiratory infections. More recent data indicate that APN plays an important role in tumor vasculogenesis, identifying it as a critical regulator of angiogenesis [75], [76].",

Thus, unlike other solid tumor malignancies, melanoma does not fit with the paradigm that NEP is lost upon tumor progression, but that gain of NEP function may be advantageous. More recently, however, it has been reported that NEP is highly expressed by human melanocytes, and that its expression and catalytic activity are downregulated by UVB light. In addition, it has been shown that \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) are specific substrates for NEP and that specific inhibition of NEP increases the melanogenic activity of these peptides on human melanocytes [81]. Among keratinocyte-derived agents, the melanotropic hormones (\u03b1-MSH) and ACTH appear to be very potent stimulators of human pigmentation. These data indicate that NEP inactivation by UVB in melanocytes may enhance the proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptides paracrine loop, mediating UV-induced pigmentation.",

Seprase is a homodimeric 170-kDa integral membrane gelatinase, whose expression appears to correlate with levels of invasiveness manifested by the human melanoma cell line, LOX, in an in vitro ECM degradation/invasion assay [88]. The deduced amino acid sequence of its 97-kDa subunit (seprase-l), predicts a type II membrane topology with a short cytoplasmic tail (six amino acids) followed by a transmembrane region (20 amino acids) and a large extracellular domain (734 amino acids) [89]. Seprase requires the dimerization of its inactive subunits for activity [89], [90]. Comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences indicate that seprase is essentially identical to human fibroblast activation protein (FAP), which is expressed on reactive stromal fibroblasts of various carcinomas and on fibroblasts of healing wounds [91], [92]. Additionally, seprase exhibits a striking sequence homology (52%) to DPPIV, which increases to a 68% amino acid identity between their catalytic regions [89].",

The first identified Eph ligand was ephrin-A1/B61, a ligand for Ephs including Eph-A2 [105], [106]. Ephrin-A1 was found to stimulate proliferation of melanoma cells that overexpress Eph-A2, and therefore, proposed to be an autocrine growth factor [104]. Normal melanocytes do not respond to ephrin-A1 nor express the Eph-A2 receptor. Immunoreactive Eph-A2 was not detectable in most uncultured lesions [107]. However, the ligand ephrin-A1 is expressed by melanoma cells, both in cultured and in uncultured lesions, and correlates with progression [107].",

These sheddases are themselves transmembrane proteins and, in several cases, are ADAMs. One of the best-studied cases of shedding is the release of tumor-necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), a cytokine that is involved in the inflammatory response. The release of TNF-\u03b1 from various cell types occurs in response to injury or infection and plays an important role in the adaptive immune response. TNF-\u03b1 is synthesized as a 26 kDa membrane-anchored protein from which an active soluble 17 kDa extracellular domain is proteolytically released.

Metalloprotease disintegrin cysteine-rich 9 (MDC9, or ADAM 9) has been reported to shed the heparin-binding EGF-like receptor [113]. Both the membrane-anchored and soluble (shed) form of this growth factor are active, but the soluble, diffusible form can act on cells distant from the site of its release. ADAM 17/TACE, ADAM 10/Kuzbanian and ADAM 9/MDC9 are three ADAM metalloproteases for which a function has been reported and that act as sheddases (reviewed in [110]).

The progression from normal melanocyte to nevus may be initiated by loss of contact between melanocytes and keratinocytes, i.e. the melanocytes escape from keratinocyte (KC) control.
