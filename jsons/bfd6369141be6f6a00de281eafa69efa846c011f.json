However, in spite of having a highly accessible public and universal health system, the COVID-19 epidemic has managed to collapse its services. Intensive Care Units have been overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases. Long working days without rest and with insufficient individual protection equipment have left a picture of thousands of health professionals infected and physically and mentally exhausted.",

Surely we must appeal to the central role played by the mildest and most asymptomatic cases in Spain. The first cases were not identified early, and individuals continued to unknowingly infect other people. As in other countries such as Italy and the United States, diagnostic tests began to be carried out in the population, although too late and only in cases where the symptoms were already severe. This made the coronavirus capable of infecting so many people without setting off alarms of the health authorities at the beginning of the epidemic. Surely the Latin and Mediterranean character of the Spanish people, a population that likes social closeness, parties, street life and physical contact through kisses and hugs, could also contribute to the rapid spread.",

The first is its long incubation period: 2 to 14 days until symptoms are shown if they appear at all, and 5 to 7 days from the appearance of the first symptoms until patients develop more severe symptoms. And the second factor is that the clinical manifestations in mild cases (80% of cases) are similar to those of colds and flu. Unfortunately, the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Spain coincided with the height of diseases typical of winter, that is people with COVID-19 but did not suspect it and unknowingly contributed to spread of the virus. In fact, it will take weeks or maybe months until we know how many Spaniards have been infected, and it may reach into the millions.",

It had been many decades, probably since the Spanish Civil War between 1936 and 1939, that Spanish society has suffered so much and in such a widespread way. The dead have been counted in thousands and it has reached a situation where it is actually a relief to hear that \"only 500\" people have died in a single day because of the coronavirus, as if we have become numb to each death. But the worst thing is that this virus, which is ravaging our country and much of the world, is socially cruel, forcing people to lock themselves in their homes, preventing their loved ones from hugging each other, forcing them to keep their distance because each person has become a threat to others and is not even letting us accompany our dead in their burial. This effect of the epidemic may be even more difficult to bear in Spain where family ties are very strong, social life is very intense and there is a need to physically express affections. For this reason, the emotional wounds of this crisis will need a long time to heal and it is possible that when all this passes, Spanish society will be very different.",

People living with HIV in Spain are among the most affected. From our research group, Salusex, and through our contact with Non-Governmental Organizations working in the field of HIV, we have been able to verify that people living with HIV are feeling threatened during this crisis. They are experiencing high levels of fear, anxiety and stress because of the possibility of being infected with another virus that could kill them. There is great concern over the lack of knowledge of how SARS-CoV-2 may synergize with HIV. People living with HIV are also concerned about access to HIV treatment. They don't know whether, in the face of the alarm and overcrowding of the health centers, they should go to the pharmacy to collect their antiretrovirals or whether it is dangerous to do so.",

However, there are people with HIV who have a weaker immune system, which theoretically could be more vulnerable, especially those who are older and with poorer health. It is these variables and not having HIV that put them at greater risk [4, 5] . Given this greater vulnerability to COVID-19, going to a doctor's office, hospital, or pharmacy is dangerous for people living with HIV. For this reason, the work of many Non-Governmental Organizations includes going to the hospital to collect the treatment for people with HIV and delivering it to patient's homes. Other hospitals are having the treatment delivered by staff to these patients so that they do not have to leave their homes. There have not been problems with the supply of antiretrovirals to patients. Prescription drugs are generally being activated without a visit to the clinic, infectious disease consultations are usually done online, and treatment is being provided in larger supplies.",

Por ello, las heridas emocionales de esta crisis necesitar\u00e1n mucho tiempo para ser curadas y es posible que, cuando todo esto pase, la sociedad espa\u00f1ola sea otra muy distinta.",

Las personas que viven con el VIH en Espa\u00f1a se encuentran entre ese colectivo. Desde nuestro grupo de investigaci\u00f3n Salusex y a trav\u00e9s de nuestro contacto con Organizaciones No Gubernamentales que trabajan en el \u00e1mbito del VIH, hemos podido comprobar que estas personas se est\u00e1n sintiendo m\u00e1s amenazadas durante esta crisis. Est\u00e1n experimentando altos niveles de miedo, ansiedad y estr\u00e9s por la posibilidad de contagiarse con un virus que les pueda matar, por el desconocimiento de c\u00f3mo puede influir el SARS-CoV-2 al tener el VIH. Pero tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n preocupados por el acceso a los tratamientos. No saben si ante el estado de alarma y de sobresaturaci\u00f3n y desbordamiento de los centros sanitarios, pueden ir a la farmacia del hospital para recoger sus antirretrovirales, si deben ir a la consulta m\u00e9dica o si resulta peligroso hacerlo y es mejor quedarse en sus casas.",

Sin embargo, hay personas con VIH que est\u00e1n con un sistema inmunitario m\u00e1s d\u00e9bil, que te\u00f3ricamente podr\u00edan ser m\u00e1s vulnerables, especialmente los que tengan una mayor edad y un peor estado de salud. Son estas variables y no tener el VIH, las que les colocan en una situaci\u00f3n de mayor riesgo [4, 5] . Ante esta situaci\u00f3n de mayor vulnerabilidad, acudir a consulta m\u00e9dica o a recoger su medicaci\u00f3n en el hospital o saltarse las medidas que todo ciudadano tiene que tomar para prevenir el COVID-19 podr\u00eda ser m\u00e1s peligroso para ellos. Por ello, est\u00e1 siendo encomiable el trabajo de muchas Organizaciones No Gubernamentales que est\u00e1n acudiendo al hospital para recoger el tratamiento de personas con VIH y llev\u00e1rselo a sus casas. Otros hospitales est\u00e1n enviando por mensajer\u00eda el tratamiento a estos pacientes para que no tengan que salir de sus hogares. No est\u00e1 habiendo problemas de abastecimiento de antirretrovirales para los pacientes. La receta farmace\u00fatica se est\u00e1 activando generalmente sin pasar presencialmente por consulta, la consulta de enfermedades infecciosas se suele hacer online en la mayor\u00eda de los casos, y se facilita el tratamiento para mas tiempo en algunos casos.",

Es importante que las personas con VIH sepan que frente a la amenaza del COVID-19 la vulnerabilidad se la dar\u00e1 su estado de salud global, no el VIH. El que tengan un temor excesivo e irracional puede hacer que algunas personas con VIH inicien un tratamiento antirretroviral determinado o lo modifiquen sin motivo, tomando otros f\u00e1rmacos o aumentando la dosis peligrosamente.",

Algunas de las m\u00e1s curiosas aseguran que el contagio es menor en climas c\u00e1lidos; que el fr\u00edo y la nive matan el virus; que los mosquitos pueden transmitirlo; que la vacuna contra la gripe, los antibi\u00f3ticos, los ba\u00f1os de agua caliente, las soluciones salinas para limpiar la nariz, o incluso comer ajo previenen el contagio; y que las l\u00e1mparas ultravioleta o rociar el cuerpo con alcohol o cloro mata al virus aunque ya haya entrado en el organismo. Las fake news, al igual que sucedi\u00f3 con el negacionismo en la pandemia del VIH, constituye una irresponsabilidad social, un delito sanitario y una segunda epidemia donde la mentira resulta tan peligrosa como la extensi\u00f3n f\u00edsica del virus.",

Pero por las informaciones que nos llegan a nuestro grupo Salusex, es posible que el confinamiento puede ayudar a disminuir el n\u00famero de contactos sexuales de riesgo o al menos el n\u00famero de personas distintas con las que se realizan estos contactos. Tambi\u00e9n el contacto sexual con trabajadores del sexo y las relaciones r\u00e1pidas a partir de las apps de contactos. Y lo mismo sucede con las actividades sexuales de riesgo asociadas al consumo de alcohol y otras drogas en el marco de fiestas o grandes eventos sociales. A cambio, es bastante probable que est\u00e9n aumentando las actividades sexuales online. No obstante, es posible que algunas personas que ni siquiera est\u00e1n realizando pr\u00e1cticas de riesgo para el VIH, est\u00e9n tomando innecesariamente la PrEP pensando que va a ser efectiva contra el COVID-19. Algunos datos provisionales de un estudio que nuestro grupo de investigaci\u00f3n Salusex est\u00e1 realizando sobre los efectos de esta epidemia en la conducta sexual de los espa\u00f1oles nos indican que en general ha disminuido la frecuencia sexual en los heterosexuales y se ha incrementado en la poblaci\u00f3n no heterosexual, pero en esta afirmaci\u00f3n se engloba todo tipo de actividad sexual incluida la masturbaci\u00f3n y el sexo online, que ha aumentado en personas de cualquier orientaci\u00f3n sexual. Por otro lado, hemos encontrado que un porcentaje mayor de no heterosexuales que de heterosexuales dice haberse saltado el confinamiento para tener relaciones con otras personas. Pero en lo que no hay diferencias es en que m\u00e1s de un tercio considera que su vida sexual ha empeorado con esta epidemia.",
