            "text": "The varied effects on ribosome subunit production and cell growth induced by different types of cellular stress are often accompanied by dramatic changes in the organization and composition of the nucleolus (Table 1\n). A well-described phenomenon is the nucleolar segregation caused by DNA damage (e.g., following UV irradiation or inhibition of topoisomerase II by drugs such as etoposide) and/or transcriptional inhibition (e.g., by actinomycin D) (Al-Baker et al., 2005, Govoni et al., 1994). Segregation is characterized by the condensation and subsequent separation of the FC and GC, together with the formation of \u201cnucleolar caps\u201d around the nucleolar remnant (also called central body) (Shav-Tal et al., 2005). Different types of caps are formed by nucleolar proteins such as UBF (Figure 1C), nucleoplasmic proteins (mostly RNA-binding proteins), and the CB marker, coilin. Importantly, nucleolar segregation is different from the process of nucleolar fragmentation, which occurs following inhibition of either RNA Pol II (but not I) or protein kinases (David-Pfeuty, 1999, Haaf and Ward, 1996) and leads to unravelling of the FC (Figure 1C). Viral infections can also cause specific changes in nucleolar morphology, such as an increase in nucleolar and/or FC size following corona virus infection (reviewed in Greco, 2009, Hiscox, 2007).",

A high transcription rate of rDNA genes and the activity of all three RNA polymerases is required in animal cells undergoing rapid proliferation to meet the cellular demand for ribosomes. Under stress conditions that affect cell-cycle progression and/or intracellular energy status, such as nutrient deprivation, alteration of ribosome subunit biosynthesis is one strategy that can preserve cellular energy homeostasis (Sengupta et al., 2010). This can occur at several different levels, which include regulation of RNA Pol I transcription and/or rRNA processing (reviewed in Chedin et al., 2007, Grummt and Voit, 2010).",

Interestingly, a change in growth conditions predominantly triggers a change in the transcriptional efficiency of already active genes, rather than the activation of silent genes (reviewed in McStay and Grummt, 2008, Moss et al., 2007). The basal transcription factors, TIF-1A, SL1, and UBF, are essential for transcription by RNA Pol I and appear to be modulated by different signaling pathways in response to changes in environmental conditions (reviewed in Grummt, 2003). A key player for the regulation of ribosomal synthesis in response to extracellular conditions is the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which promotes pre-rRNA synthesis by regulating the localization and/or activity of TIF-1A, SL1, and UBF, as well as translation of RPs (Mayer and Grummt, 2006, Xiao and Grove, 2009).",

Although the mechanisms for starvation-induced inactivation of mTOR are not completely understood, mTOR activity is inhibited by an increase in the cellular AMP/ATP ratio upon nutrient deprivation, via activation of the LKB1-AMPK pathway (Hardie, 2005, Sengupta et al., 2010). Overall, a complex signaling network that integrates mTOR, PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways is involved in the regulation of ribosome subunit production in response either to changes in nutrient levels, or to growth factor signaling such as IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) signaling (James and Zomerdijk, 2004).",

The other functions include biogenesis of multiple RNPs, cell-cycle control, apoptosis, viral infection, DNA replication, and repair, consistent with a role for the nucleolus in providing a link between ribosome subunit biosynthesis, cell-cycle progression, and stress signaling.",

Proteomic studies have analyzed the dynamics of the nucleolar proteome in response to stress stimuli, including actinomycin D-mediated inhibition of transcription, viral infection, and DNA damage (Andersen et al., 2005, Boisvert et al., 2010, Boisvert and Lamond, 2010, Emmott et al., 2010, Lam et al., 2010), revealing a complex reorganization of the nucleolus during the stress response. In these studies, mass spectrometry (MS)-based SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture) quantitative proteomics (Ong et al., 2002) provide an unbiased and high-throughput approach for characterizing the nucleolar proteome and its dynamics under stress conditions. Rather than defining a nucleolar proteome without reference to the rest of the cell, the \u201cspatial proteomics\u201d approach measures the relative distribution of cellular proteins between different cell compartments. For example, measurement of protein levels between cytoplasm, nucleus, and nucleolus was used to characterize dynamic changes in protein localization following etoposide-induced DNA damage (Boisvert et al., 2010, Boisvert and Lamond, 2010) (Figure 2\n). Furthermore, spatial proteomics performed in parallel on two HCT116 cell lines, either p53\n+/+ or p53\n\u2212/\u2212, showed that etoposide-induced redistribution of RPs from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm is p53 dependent (Boisvert and Lamond, 2010).",

A complementary fluorescence imaging approach has measured the levels and locations of more than 1000 endogenously tagged proteins in individual living cells before and after CPT (camptothecin) treatment, a specific topoisomerase I inhibitor. This revealed rapid changes in concentration and localization of proteins involved in nucleolar stress, DNA damage, and oxidative stress pathways (Cohen et al., 2008). Interestingly, most proteins that translocated in response to CPT are nucleolar proteins. For example, nucleolar intensity of tagged topoisomerase I, the drug target, decreases in less than 2 min after treatment while other nucleolar proteins, including RPs, show a decrease in nucleolar intensity in less than 1 hr following the addition of the drug. This suggests that nucleolar stress is an immediate effect of CPT and that the nucleolus is involved in early steps of the cellular stress response.",

For example, the NPM/B23-p14ARF-p53 pathway has been well described and represents a good example of nucleolar proteins that are translocated to the nucleoplasm under stress conditions, leading to the stabilization of p53 via interaction of p14ARF with Hdm2, a major player in the negative regulation of p53 (described in detail below) (Gjerset and Bandyopadhyay, 2006). In yeast, detailed molecular mechanisms that link cdc14B translocation from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm upon DNA damage with the activation of the G2 checkpoint have been deciphered, showing that nucleoplasmic accumulation of cdc14B stabilizes both Claspin, an activator of the DNA damage checkpoint, and Wee1, an inhibitor of cell-cycle progression (Bassermann et al., 2008). In contrast, RelA(p65), a subunit of NF-kB, is targeted to the nucleolus in a stress-dependent manner and triggers apoptosis (Thoms et al., 2010). Nucleolar stress signaling pathways rely on the dynamic sequestration and/or release of proteins in response to stress stimuli, which raises the question of the molecular mechanisms involved in protein nucleolar targeting (discussed by Emmott and Hiscox, 2009). It is anticipated that posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of nucleolar proteins may also play a major role in stress-induced changes in protein localization.",

This relocalization results from a combination of a constitutive nucleolar targeting signal along with an autoinhibitory motif indicating that this is a tightly controlled mechanism and not just an indirect effect of stress (Banski et al., 2010b). These observations suggest that the cellular stress response requires the coordinated action of these chaperones and associated proteins in the nucleolus, possibly because essential cellular activities that are particularly sensitive to stress require special attention from chaperones.",

This occurs following oncogenic or genotoxic stresses, such as hyperproliferative signals emanating from oncogenic Ras and overexpressed Myc. p14ARF, like p53, is maintained at low levels at steady state in most cell types due to ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Upregulation of p14ARF prevents the proliferation of cells bearing damaged DNA via the stabilization of p53, and consistent with this, p14ARF is often mutated or silenced in tumor cells (Montanaro et al., 2008). p14ARF binds Hdm2 and blocks its interaction with p53. Although p14ARF is a nucleolar protein, it is not clear if relocalization of Hdm2 to the nucleolus is necessary to prevent its interactions with p53, or if it is sufficient for p14ARF to inhibit the ubiquitin ligase activity of Hdm2 in the nucleoplasm (Kruse and Gu, 2009, Lee and Gu, 2010). Indeed, the C-terminal region of ARF, which includes the nucleolar localization sequence, is not essential for the regulation of p53 ubiquitinylation by Hdm2 (Zhang and Xiong, 1999).",

B23/NPM is also upregulated following oncogenic stress (Chen et al., 2010). Failure to activate these p14ARF-B23/NPM-p53 pathways responsible for p14ARF stabilization is observed in many forms of cancer; for example, a high-mutation rate of B23/NPM is observed in primary acute myeloid leukemia, and the overexpression of ULF is detected in many human tumors (Chen et al., 2010). These pathways are also subjected to a negative feedback loop, since p14ARF promotes the ubiquitinylation and degradation of B23/NPM, leading to inhibition of pre-rRNA processing and subsequent disruption of ribosome subunit biogenesis (Olson, 2004).",

RPL11 is normally modified by the ubiquitin-like modifier NEDD8 following its translation in the cytoplasm. NEDD8 modification is promoted by Hdm2 and is required for RPL11 stabilization and nucleolar localization. Following stress, RPL11 is de-NEDDylated, resulting in its nucleoplasmic accumulation. Although this leads to RPL11 degradation, it can first interact with Hdm2 and mediate p53 stabilization (Sundqvist et al., 2009). The release of RPL11 into the nucleoplasm appears to be a common link between a number of pathways that survey the maturation of the small and large ribosomal subunits (e.g., 18S and 28S rRNA production) and regulate p53 stability in response to defects in these processes (Holzel et al., 2010).",

As already discussed, under normal conditions, ubiquitination of p53 via E3 ligases such as Hdm2 is associated with the suppression of p53 activity. Many stress-responses pathways lead to a decrease in p53 ubiquitination, via mechanisms that involve either increases, such as for p14ARF and B23/NPM, or decreases, such as for RPs, in the nucleolar levels of particular proteins (see above; Hock and Vousden, 2010, Lee and Gu, 2010). Furthermore, following cellular stresses/oncogenic activation that upregulate p14ARF, there is evidence that SUMOylation of p53 is upregulated in an Hdm2-dependent manner, which may result in an increase in the nucleolar localization of p53 and thus suppress nucleoplasmic functions of p53. However, the precise role of SUMOylation in p53 function is yet to be clearly elucidated (Carter and Vousden, 2009, Stehmeier and Muller, 2009).",

These modifications include phosphorylation, methylation, NEDDylation, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine, ADP-ribosylation, prolyl isomerization, and oxidation of methionine. Many of the p53 PTMs are targeted to overlapping residues, suggesting that some are in direct competition (Carter and Vousden, 2009).

However, the redistribution of coilin, and other CB components, varies according to the type of stress, as summarized in Table 1. Nutrient deprivation results in a decreased number of CBs (Andrade et al., 1993), whereas UV-C irradiation, osmotic stress, and heat shock reversibly disrupt CBs, as visualized by the redistribution of coilin to nucleoplasmic microfoci (Cioce et al., 2006, Handwerger et al., 2002) (Figure 1C). A subset of UV-C-irradiated cells also forms coilin-containing nucleolar caps, similar to those observed upon the inhibition of RNA Pol I and II by actinomycin D (Andersen et al., 2005, Shav-Tal et al., 2005). In cells treated with DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-\u03b2-D-ribobenzimidazole), a kinase inhibitor that inhibits RNA polymerase II transcription, coilin relocalizes to cap-like structures associated with the nucleolus (Figure 1C). Following viral infection, different types of CB-like structures have been observed. In HSV-1-infected cells, ICP0 (viral protein infected cell protein 0) expression induces the destabilization of centromeres and the subsequent redistribution of coilin, SMN, and fibrillarin to the damaged centromeres (Morency et al., 2007). In contrast, adenovirus-induced \u201crosettes\u201d reflect the recruitment of coilin and other CB components to the periphery of viral replication centers, where they are involved in processing of late-phase viral transcripts (James et al., 2010). Similarly, in plants, groundnut rosette virus (GRV) infection leads to the reorganization of CBs into CB-like structures containing viral protein ORF3, which fuse with the nucleolus and facilitate the formation of viral RNP particles that are efficient for systemic infection (Kim et al., 2007). The redistribution of coilin observed upon viral infection may reflect that the CB RNA processing machinery is \u201chijacked\u201d by the virus.",

            "text": "Most stress signals that induce CB disruption are accompanied by transcription inhibition. In particular, snRNA transcription is inhibited upon UV-C irradiation, in a p53-dependent manner (Gridasova and Henry, 2005), as well as histone mRNA transcription (Bongiorno-Borbone et al., 2010). This supports the idea that UV-C-induced CB disruption is associated with CB activity being, at least partially, shut down. However, is the inhibition of CB activity the cause or the consequence of CB disruption? In fact, the inhibition of either transcription, or snRNP biogenesis, can induce CB disruption (Carmo-Fonseca et al., 1992, Lemm et al., 2006). Conversely, CB disruption induced by coilin depletion induces defects in snRNP biogenesis (Strzelecka et al., 2010). It is therefore likely that mechanisms involved in snRNA processing inhibition and CB disruption are intimately interconnected.",

Interestingly, p53 has been detected in CBs upon UV-C treatment (Young et al., 2002). In addition, different types of stress that affect CB integrity, such as the inhibition of transcription and/or snRNA processing, induce the redistribution of coilin to the nucleolus (Figure 1C and Table 1). An important question is whether the stress-induced redistribution of coilin to the nucleolus is associated with a specific role of coilin, and other CB components, in the stress response. Given that coilin is required for efficient viral infection (James et al., 2010, Kim et al., 2007) and that coilin is sometimes found associated with remnants of nucleolar transcription upon UV-C irradiation and with the unravelled rDNA transcription units upon \u03b1-amanitin treatment (Cioce et al., 2006, Haaf and Ward, 1996), it is possible that CB-like structures are involved in the processing of specific subsets of RNA transcripts produced under stress conditions. Altogether, although underlying mechanisms remain to be deciphered, these observations suggest a possible crosstalk between the nucleolus and CBs during the stress response.",

Therefore, it is likely that stress-induced disassembly of CBs results from specific mechanisms that affect interactions between CB components, and/or provoke the degradation of one or several CB components. Changes in the CB protein interaction network could result from posttranslational modification of key CB components. In particular, SUMOylation of CB components has been proposed to increase upon stress (Navascues et al., 2008). Other modifications of coilin, such as phosphorylation and methylation, could play a role in stress-induced coilin redistribution. Indeed, coilin phosphorylation, as well as coilin demethylation, affects its self-association properties and results in its nucleolar accumulation (Hebert, 2010, Tapia et al., 2010).",

            "text": "UV-C-induced coilin redistribution is mediated, at least in part, by the proteasome activator subunit PA28\u03b3 (Cioce et al., 2006). This suggests that proteasomal activity is required for CB disruption and that active mechanisms are responsible for stress-induced CB fragmentation. Although coilin levels show little or no change upon UV-C irradiation (Cioce et al., 2006), a recent study demonstrated that FLASH, an essential component of CBs, is degraded by the proteasome upon UV-C treatment (Bongiorno-Borbone et al., 2010). Since PA28\u03b3 and FLASH interact in a yeast two-hybrid assay (Mao et al., 2008), it will be interesting to analyze whether this degradation is PA28\u03b3 dependent, and whether other CB components are also specifically degraded upon stress. More generally, the role of the proteasome in the stress-induced reorganization of nuclear architecture also needs to be deciphered. At this stage, it is tempting to draw a parallel with the proteasome impairment observed in several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's or Parkinson's, which leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in nuclear aggregates (Rubinsztein, 2006). Could these aggregates be linked to a defect in the proteasome-mediated reorganization of the nucleus upon stress? Future studies to analyze the role of the proteasome and PA28\u03b3 in stress-induced reorganization of nuclear architecture may provide further insights into our understanding of these diseases.",

Both the nucleolus and CBs appear to be major targets of signaling pathways that are activated by the cellular stress response, resulting in a complex range of changes in the organization, size, and protein content of these two nuclear organelles. Nucleolar function in coupling ribosome subunit biogenesis and cell-cycle progression, by controlling the activity of the tumor suppressor protein p53, places the nucleolus as a central hub in coordinating the cellular stress response. Although the mechanisms controlling these stress signaling pathways have been analyzed extensively, and a wide range of stress-responsive protein complexes have been identified, many details remain uncharacterized. In particular, the molecular mechanisms that affect nucleolar and CB structure and function under stress conditions need to be elucidated. Hence, valuable new insights should be provided by studying the dynamics of large-scale protein-protein interaction networks and the changes in PTMs of key nuclear factors under stress conditions.
