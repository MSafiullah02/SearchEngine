Torovirus genome consists of 6 ORFs, ORFs 1a and 1b, comprising the 5'-most two-thirds of the genome, and four additional ORFs encoding the structural proteins S, M, N, and HE. In BEV, ORF4, corresponding to the HE protein, the gene found in the bovine and porcine isolates. A distinct characteristic of the torovirus particles is the high morphological variability that they exhibit once they are released from infected cells. Spherical, oval, elongated, and kidney-shaped virions can be torovirus morphogenesis is still poorly understood and further studies are required to characterize this process at both morphological and molecular levels as well as to understand the structure of torovirus particles. All the information about the structure and morphogenesis of toroviruses comes from early studies performed by conventional electron microscopy examination of thin sections from cultured equine dermis cells infected with BEV, 1,2 as well as from intestinal tissue from calves infected with the bovine torovirus BRV. 3 These studies provided detailed descriptions of the different viral assemblies. However, in the past two decades new methods for structural analysis by ultrastructure of cellular and viral components. Freeze-substitution is one of these high preservation methods that has been shown to greatly reduce artifactual changes in shape and size that can occur during fixation and dehydration of the sample when conventional treatments are used. Thus, in this work, BEV infected cells were fixed and treated by this technique to examine torovirus particles in the context of infected cells. To perform a specific against BEV structural proteins. These antibodies were used to perform immunolabeling to detect viral proteins at the electron microscopy level and by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy.",

As shown in Figure 2A , anti-N antibodies label the internal material being released from viral particles after mild detergent treatment, but there is no reactivity with intact virions (not shown). Antibodies to the N terminus of the M protein clearly decorated the surface of the virion (Fig. 2B, F) , while those directed against the C-terminal end of the protein do not react with intact particles (Fig. 2C, G) . This result is in agreement with the topological model proposed for this protein by Den Boon et al. 4 Using in vitro protein synthesis and protease treatment they proposed that the N-terminus of the M protein would be exposed on the surface of nucleocapsid. The mAbs G11 and AF3 provide a weak but specific surface labeling, and both are able to neutralize viral infectivity (not shown).",

The result shown in Figure 5 reveals a clear co-localization of the two proteins, indicating that M is incorporated in this membranous compartment, and suggesting that, as occurs in coronaviruses, budding of progeny viruses occurs in this membranous compartment.
