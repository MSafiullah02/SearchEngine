            "text": "Data clustering, i.e., finding groups of similar objects, is an established and widely used technique for unsupervised problems and/or for explorative data analysis. However, when facing high-dimensional data, particularly clustering algorithms quickly reach the boundaries of their usefulness as most of them are not designed to deal with the problems known by the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d. Due to inherent sparsity in high-dimensional data, distances between any two objects measured in the full dimensional space tend to become the same for all pairs of objects and, thus, can no longer be used to distinguish similar from dissimilar objects. Furthermore, clusters often appear within different lower dimensional subspaces. Therefore, it is usually not useful to search for clusters in the full dimensional data space or apply dimensionality reduction which would only result in one subspace rather than several different ones. To overcome those issues, several subspace clustering algorithms have been developed in the past that simultaneously search for meaningful subspaces and for clusters (within these subspaces). Some of these algorithms, e.g. [4, 15, 16], assume attribute independence and restrict themselves to the detection of axis-parallel subspace clusters for performance reason. More general, so-called correlation clustering algorithms, e.g. [1, 2, 7, 8], allow arbitrarily oriented subspaces that represent a (usually linear) combination of features, i.e., explicitly allow correlation among features.",

            "text": "Another, yet less considered challenge is subspace clustering in data streams. Nowadays, as data is produced with high velocity, streaming algorithms become more and more important. This also holds for areas where high-dimensional data is produced rapidly, e.g., in industry where large numbers of machine sensors record huge amounts of data within short time periods. In these scenarios, the data can usually no longer be stored entirely and hence there is a general need for suitable data handling strategies for clustering algorithms such that the data can be processed within a single scan. In this work, we tackle this problem and present a novel oriented subspace clustering algorithm that is able to detect arbitrarily oriented subspace clusters in data streams. This method not only reduces the amount of required memory for processing the data significantly, but also compresses entire groups of data that are similar wrt to various combinations of features. The key idea of the proposed method is to load chunks of data into memory, deriving so-called Concepts as summary structures and applying a decay mechanism to downgrade the relevance of stale data. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the usefulness of the presented method and shows that the used heap space is drastically reduced without losses in terms of runtime and accuracy.",

A large group of algorithms rely on (clustering) feature vector (CF) data structures that have originally been proposed for the BIRCH algorithm [22]. The idea is to represent a set of data objects by only a few key statistics that sufficiently describe the aggregated data. This approach has been adapted for many other stream clustering approaches, e.g., [3, 9, 10]. Another compression technique that is widely employed for stream clustering is to only keep track of the cluster representatives. The basic idea is to represent entire chunks of data solely in form of cluster representatives, e.g., cluster centroids, [12, 17, 23]. Further, but less related, techniques to deal with the challenge of summarizing data streams can be found in [21].",

The first method able to cluster high-dimensional data streams properly was HPStream [4], a k-means based axis-parallel subspace clustering method that uses an adopted form of CF vectors to represent relevant cluster statistics. IncPreDeCon [15] is an incremental, axis-parallel subspace clsutering algorithm based on a density-based clustering model that supports incremental updates but lacks supporting any form of aging and hence cannot deal with streaming data directly. PreDeConStream [13] and HDDStream [16] present density-based (axis-parallel) subspace clustering algorithms that both aggregate incoming data objects within different microcluster structures and retrieve the final clustering by following (slightly different) variants of the density-based clustering scheme proposed in [6]. The SiblingTree method [18] is a grid-based axis-parallel subspace clustering approach aiming at detecting all low-dimensional clusters in all subspaces. All these previously mentioned methods are limited to find axis-parallel subspaces. The recently presented CorrStream algorithm [8] is a PCA-based approach for arbitrarily-oriented subspace clustering on data streams. As a PCA-based method, it determines subspace clusters derived from neighborhood sets, and hence is prone to outliers. In contrast, our method relies on Hough transformation and hence is able to filter outlier.\n",

            "text": "The Hough transformation originally has been introduced for detecting linear segments in image data [19]. The basic idea is to map every object in data space to its corresponding object function in Hough space, and subsequently identify intersections of a specific amount of object functions. If such an intersection exists, the corresponding data objects are located on a line segment in data space. This duality of the Hough transform is shown in Fig. 1. The CASH algorithm [1] borrows this idea of parameter space transformation for the sake of oriented subspace clustering. Precisely, they transform objects from data space to Hough space and scan the Hough space for dense areas, i.e., areas where many functions intersect, by subdividing the space into grid cells in a top-down fashion. For a given cell c, if the number of object functions intersecting c is greater or equal than a pre-defined minPts parameter, c is split into halves according to a predefined order on the axes. The division terminates if a resulting cell is either considered sparse, i.e., the number of object functions intersecting this cell is less than minPts, or a maximum number of splits maxSplit is reached. A grid cell c that is dense after maxSplit divisions represents a cluster: the points corresponding to the functions intersecting c form a cluster within a arbitrarily oriented \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$(d-1)$$\\end{document}-dimensional subspace.

To tackle these challenges, we propose to process incoming data in batches, similar to [12], i.e., loading chunks of data into memory and eventually computing cluster representatives which are kept in memory while the actual data objects are discarded. This data processing scheme has several advantages as it (1) enables the adaptation to concept shifts since processing data batch-wise allows to identify dense grid cells1, potentially with novel subspaces, during the division steps, (2) caps the amount of consumed memory and (3) even allows the flexibility to adjust to changing data dimensionality as there is no need for defining a static grid. Precisely, our algorithm basically performs an adapted variant of CASH on single data chunks and keeps cluster representatives, that we will refer to as Concepts, in memory. Since the Concepts must be maintained efficiently, they are designed to be additive, such that two similar Concepts can conveniently be unified into a single Concept (see Fig. 2). Algorithm 1 outlines the main procedure of CashStream. After defining the Concept data structure, we define the similarity between Concepts and describe the unification step as well as the aging procedure in the following.\n",

In terms of Concept similarity, this means that two Concepts shall be considered similar as long as the intersections of their subspace equations describe approximately the same subspace, regardless the orientations of their subspace equations when considering them individually. Given this observation and the fact that each subspace hyperplane is defined by its normal vectors, we formalize the distance measure based on the following idea: Understanding an intersecting set of hyperplanes as the set of their respective normal vectors, every other normal vector contained in a second set of equations representing the same linear subspace is linearly dependent to the first set. However, since we aim at quantifying the linear dependence of these vectors rather than just determining whether they are linearly dependent or not, we propose the following similarity measure.

For measuring the clustering quality of CashStream, we compare the results to a clustering on the same dataset for several different settings of the batch size parameter, including the batch size for which a single batch contains the entire dataset, which is equivalent to the static CASH. In terms of evaluation metrics, we employ the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and the Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) scores. Note that due to the lack of ground truth in the real-world dataset, we restrict ourselves to a synthetic dataset for evaluating the clustering quality. The calculated ARI and AMI for this dataset can be seen in Table 1. In general, it can be observed that the clustering quality slightly drops when choosing a batch size below 1000. This might indicate that the subsample might not reflect the data distribution sufficiently when choosing the batch size too small, which can be especially problematic in scenarios where correlations are imperfect. Another reason for the decreasing clustering accuracy can be the presence of temporal effects (i.e., slight drifts in the data distribution, increasing amount of noise, etc.).\n",

For the throughput experiment, we used the enlarged real-world dataset to demonstrate the scalability of the batched streaming approach. In Fig. 3, we report the throughput in data points per second and the total runtime in seconds. Each of the reported values is the mean value over three runs. For all those runs, we compared the resulting clustering models (by means of comparing the detected subspaces) with the expected clustering model and selected the parameter setting according to the best result. This experiment shows that the stream processing procedure has no loss in runtime compared to the static variant. In particular, it can be seen that the unification of Concepts barely has any effect on the runtime performance. We also observe that the batch size barely affects this performance measure.",

Precisely, CashStream relies on the subspace clustering paradigm that was introduced for the static CASH algorithm, i.e., using Hough transformations to identify interesting linear subspaces. However, in contrast to CASH, the proposed algorithm uses a batch processing scheme, identifies interesting subspaces within the data batches, and subsequently compresses important information within Concept data structures. Our experiments showed that CashStream is fairly robust against different choices for the batch size and simultaneously reduces the memory consumption significantly compared to the static CASH algorithm (less than 50% on the real-world dataset). At the same time the loss in terms of clustering quality is negligible.",
