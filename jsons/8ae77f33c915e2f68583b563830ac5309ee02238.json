We also observed peak MPV detections during late winter and early spring, consistent with other recent surveillance reports [30] . PIVs were detected throughout the year but with varying incidence and seasonality by type. According to several longitudinal surveillance programs, PIV-1 demonstrates a biennial seasonal pattern with increased incidence in uneven years [25, 31, 32] , which may explain the low incidence of PIV-1 in 2010. The seasonality of PIV-2 and PIV-3 matched expected patterns [32] . The characteristic lack of ADV seasonality [9, 21] was observed in IISP but with a slight decrease in incidence during the summer months that has been described by Olofsson [30] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 653, "end": 657, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 658, "end": 662, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 663, "end": 667, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 735, "end": 739, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 866, "end": 870, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1113, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1114, "end": 1117, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1118, "end": 1121, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1239, "end": 1243, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1289, "end": 1292, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1293, "end": 1296, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1419, "end": 1423, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 222, "end": 230, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "We used provider patient populations as the denominator for calculating incidence. The difficulty in defining catchment areas and thus the utility of using patient populations for outpatient incidence estimation, as well as the comparability of these estimates, have been demonstrated previously [10, 33] . Furthermore, the United Kingdom has long reported the weekly incidence of ILI similarly based on practitioners' registered patients [34] . Underscoring the unique nature of IISP data, there are currently no US-based alternative sources of data with which to directly compare. A study by Neuzil et al found a comparable incidence of outpatient ARIs that could be attributed to a respiratory virus of 43-67/1000 among adults aged \u226518 years [4] . Our incidence, as expected, was lower than estimates reported in much of the literature, due in part to the use among the most-comparable studies of broadly defined and less specific criteria for respiratory illness or to the lack of a laboratory-confirmed influenza outcome [35, 36] . Another possible reason IISP incidence estimates were lower was that our surveillance largely represented primary care providers, while community-based and health maintenance organization population-based estimates have included healthcare visits at all points of care, including emergency departments or urgent care clinics. Future analyses with healthcare utilization data will be conducted to determine the representative proportion of primary care providers in disease burden estimation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 296, "end": 300, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 301, "end": 304, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 439, "end": 443, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 745, "end": 748, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1030, "text": "[35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1031, "end": 1034, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The IISP was subject to some limitations. The surveillance design targeted traditional outpatient HCPs, which may have led to an underrepresentation of patients aged \u226565 years, because elderly patients are known to be underrepresented in surveillance owing to atypical clinical presentations assay insensitivity in this population [37] . As demonstrated by the proficiency testing, we found differential levels of sensitivity between the commercial multiplex assays and the CDC virus-specific RT-PCR assays, which may have resulted in underestimates among multiplex sites; however, proficiency testing suggested that lower sensitivity would most likely occur among patients with very low viral loads. Furthermore, patients, particularly adults, may not have had detectable virus at the time of the visit, because of a shorter duration of shedding, time from onset to specimen collection, noninfectious illnesses, or nonoptimally collected specimens. Finally, our test panel included only select viral pathogens; thus, specimens with negative results could have been associated with pathogens not included in our panel in all sites, such as the coronaviruses, which composed 7% of specimens in sites that did include them.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 331, "end": 335, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The IISP is the first surveillance program in the United States to use molecular virologic techniques to evaluate annual respiratory infection etiology and incidence.

Furthermore, year-round, systematic RSV detection data can inform appropriate initiation of palivizumab RSV prophylaxis, which is typically limited to only 5 monthly doses per year because of the high cost [38] .
