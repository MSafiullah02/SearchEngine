Since its outbreak in China in December 2019, over 4 million cases have been confirmed across more than 200 countries 1 (as of May 15, 2020) , with the number of cases continuing to increase. Several studies have characterized possible symptoms and risk factors for clinical outcomes 2, 3 . However, the majority of retrospective studies have been based on a single center and counted the number of aggregate cases 4 , providing a scattered and incomplete picture of the risk factors for disease severity. Furthermore, uncharacterized or uncommon symptoms have made COVID-19 difficult to diagnose, and make it difficult to provide appropriate treatment to patients. Lack of vaccine and optimized treatment raise the importance of early and definitive diagnosis for this disease. Additionally, there are limited hospital resources to triage patients based on symptoms to determine who is more or less likely to require intensive treatment (e.g. ICU admission or intubation).",

Instead of conducting time-consuming and costly clinical trials to examine patients, an alternative research avenue involves scraping public social media data to investigate potential clinical and demographic variables of COVID-19 development. Social media provides an efficient method of gathering large amounts of representative data on the general public, in a cost-effective, scalable, and convenient manner any time of day, especially in remote or unattended regions. Here, we systematically integrated and analyzed published biomedical literature and social media data to identify novel clinical and demographic variables specific for different outcomes of COVID-19, and also examined rare or uncommon symptoms that were associated with COVID-19 progression but were not previously well characterized.",

We then collected an additional tweet posts generated 14 days before and 14 days after their original tweets mentioning COVID-19 status (84,140 tweets). To identify symptoms that were mentioned in tweets, we applied two symptom extraction methods. Amazon Comprehend Medical tool was applied to an entire set of tweets.

In case a statistical test was not performed, we decided that there was a positive association when the outcome group showed a 1.5-fold higher value than the control group. Negative association indicated that a variable in the outcome group showed a hazard/odd ratio <1, or lower value with a reported statistical significance (p-value < 0.05) compared to the control group. In case a statistical test was not performed, we decided that there was a negative association when the outcome group showed a 1.5-fold lower value than the control group. When there was no significant change between the outcome group and control group, no-association was assigned between variable and clinical outcome. In terms of sex, when there were more males compared to females, we assumed there was a positive association with an outcome based on the case studies of sex and age of COVID-19 patients in Italy 8 and New York City 9 (as of April 14, 2020) .

We collected variables that were tested at least twice in a given outcome and defined them as outcome-specific variables when they showed positive associations with a given outcome in more than half of studies ( figure 2 and   appendix 4) . We observed that different sets of variables were associated with individual outcomes, meanwhile, no variable was universal across all clinical outcomes (figure 2A) . Age was specific variable for ARDS, disease severity, death, ICU admission, and O 2 saturation, but not specific for diagnosis and hospitalization (figure 2B). Sex (male) was specific variable for ARDS, disease severity, death and ICU admission. Three lab findings (D-dimer, C reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase) were specifically associated with four outcomes. Diabetes and hypertension (comorbidity/complication) were specific for disease severity and death. Also, there were variables only specific for one outcome. Arrhythmia, thyroid disease (comorbidity/complication), confusion/fluster, tonsil swelling, enlargement of lymph nodes/sinus (symptom), and levels of IL-10 and NT-proBNP (N-terminal-pro hormone BNP, lab finding) were only specific for the severity of disease progression. Level of prothrombin time was specific variable for ICU admission. For death, SOFA score (lab finding), and anemia (symptom) showed positive associations. Fever was a specific variable for O 2 saturation. There was no significantly associated variable for diagnosis and hospitalization indicating the current lack of clinical understanding at the early stage of COVID-19. Identified outcome-specific variables could be surrogate risk factors to identify COVID-19 patients and determine their treatment options.",

Although COVID-19 showed heterogeneous and uncharacterized symptoms, biomedical literature considered a limited number of symptoms known for infectious diseases, such as fever, cough, and fatigue. Social media can provide rapid and efficient surveillance of disease risk and outbreaks 11, 12 . Therefore, we decided to expand the symptom landscape by integrating social media data with biomedical literature. We first identified 1,036 twitter users who introduced themselves as COVID-19 positive patients, and selected 574 users (55%) who openly and voluntarily discussed their COVID-19 symptoms (see Methods for details). In total, 51 symptoms were identified in social media data ( figure 3A and appendix 5) . On average, individual users mentioned 3 different symptoms (range of 1-15). We grouped 51 symptoms into three categories based on their frequency of mention ( figure 3B and appendix 5) . Common symptoms (11 symptoms) were mentioned by >10% of users. Many were non-specific symptoms of respiratory infections, such as fever, cough, and chest tightness/dyspnea. However, 14 symptoms were potentially COVID-19-specific, and rarely reported in social media (rare, <1% of users). Sputum, dehydration, enlargement of lymph nodes or sinus, and oral problems (e.g., abrasions in mouth, mouth ulcers, sensitive teeth, toothache, and dry mouth) were defined as rare symptoms. Twenty-six symptoms were observed ranging from 1% to 10% of users (less common). They included chills, chest pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and skin problems such as blister, dry skin, chapped lips, and itching. We next examined the symptoms that were mentioned together ( figure 3C and appendix 6) . Of 612 symptom pairs that co-occurred, 264 (43%) were between common and less common symptoms (figure 3D). One major cluster of symptoms was frequently mentioned together (figure 3E). They were composed of 8 common (dry or sore throat, fever, chest tightness/dyspnea, cough, weakness, myalgia/fatigue, headache/dizziness, and body ache/pain: neck and back pain, and general body ache) and 8 less common symptoms (cold-like symptoms, chest pain and congestion, gastrointestinal symptoms, chills, stuffy or runny nose, nausea/vomiting, and respiratory symptoms, such as lung pain). There were also two pairs of rare symptoms (figure 3D): anemia-weight gain and anemia-urination problems (e.g., urinary retention and weakened bladder). All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, various articles have indicated that between 4% and 78% of all COVID-19 positive patients were asymptomatic 17 , and this seems to vary widely based on age of patients, test location, and time of testing after infection [18] [19] [20] [21] . Thus, our research is in line with other studies demonstrating the vast range of COVID-19 patients who show or report no symptoms. It should also be noted that Twitter was the source of social media data that we examined, and perhaps more symptoms would be discovered if we analyzed other various sources.

Positive associations indicated higher values (e.g., disease severity increases as patients get older), while negative associations indicated lower values (e.g., disease severity increases as basophil count gets lower) of variables associated with clinical outcomes (see Methods for details). No-association indicated there was no relation between variables and outcomes. We found that the majority of variables (95 variables, 93%) had inconsistent associations across clinical outcomes showing mixed association types (figure 1B). Of those, 46 (45%) variables had all three types of associations. For example, cancer showed positive-, negative-, and no-associations in 58%, 26%, and 16% of studies, respectively (asterisk in figure 1B). 43% (9/21) of comorbidity/complication, 40% (6/15) of treatment, and 73% (11/15) of symptom variables showed all three types of associations. Laboratory findings showed relatively more consistent associations with clinical outcomes: 38% (18/48) of variablesshowed all association types. Furthermore, we found that variables had unique association types depending on different clinical outcomes.
