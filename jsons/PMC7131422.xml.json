Image may be considered as the perception of a person or an organization or a government held by other persons, organizations, or governments. Because a person's image is influenced by one's own words and actions, as well as by the discourse and behavior of others (Benoit & Brinson, 1999), an organization's or government's image may also be influenced by the words and actions of its representatives, as well as the discourse and behaviors of other organizations or governments.",

Zhang and Benoit (2004) investigated image repair efforts by Saudi Arabia following the attacks on American on 9/11: 15 of 19 hijackers were citizens of Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government relied mostly on denial and bolstering and was fairly successful at dealing with the accusation that it supported terrorism; it was less effective in dealing with concerns that Saudi Arabia had not sufficiently supported the U.S. on Iraq. Drumheller and Benoit (2004) examined attempts by the U.S. Navy to deal with Japanese casualties when the submarine USS Greeneville collided with a fishing trawler, the Ehime Maru. Mortification was used but not as effectively as it could have been: cultural norms in Japan stipulated that the apology should have been made directly to the victims\u2019 families. This study adds to that literature by analyzing China's Former Health Minister Zhang Wenkang's discourse (Zhang, 2003) on the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic to see whether it helped repair the image of the Chinese government.",

From then until June 24, 2003 when the World Health Organization lifted the warning against travel to Beijing, the last area on the Chinese mainland for which WHO advised against travel (Kahn, 2003), SARS had appeared to be so rampant, causing across the world 8461 cases of infection and 805 deaths (WHO, 2003a). Compared with other countries and territories, the mainland and its Hong Kong Special Administrative Region suffered most from the havoc with 5326 people infected and 347 deaths, and 1755 and 296, respectively (WHO, 2003a). The economic losses China suffered from due to SARS were huge: $25 billion according to analysts from Peking University (U.S. Commercial Service, 2003).",

The international community was annoyed with China's secretiveness concerning SARS (Metzler, 2003). Mr. Zhang and his health ministry withheld the effects of the disease that had plagued China since November 2002 (Beech, 2003). It was not until April 3, 2003 that Zhang finally broke a 4-month silence to declare on behalf of his ministry and the Chinese government that SARS cases were only found in parts of China and that it was under effective control; in fact, the epidemic had escaped China and appeared in no fewer than 13 countries (Elegant, 2003). Tragically, the killer virus undercut China's new image, which refers to the new and heralded leadership of Hu Jintao that had been making efforts to establish a newly founded transparency and more open communication since he formally assumed office as China's political supremo in March 2003 (Metzler, 2003). Of course, a government's image may not change overnight.",

Second, defeasibility claims the offensive act occurred due to a lack of information or ability. Third, the strategy of accident declares that the action was not done purposefully. Accident is typically considered to be an unforeseen event, thus mitigating blame (Fishman, 1999). The fourth tactic is good intentions. This strategy admits that the accused performed the wrongful act but claims that it was justified by the accused's laudable purposes (Fishman, 1999).",

When his denials became unsupportable, Clinton admitted having an improper relationship and employed mortification. In the final stage, \u201cClinton's image restoration strategies were mostly successful\u201d (Blaney and Benoit, p. 105). Of course, sometimes rhetors can wait too long to use mortification, as with President Nixon and the Watergate affair (Benoit, 1982). In comparison to these former U.S. presidents, Zhang never used mortification in his discourse. Even when his simple denial was spotted self-contradictory at the conference, he still stubbornly denied his wrongful act: covering up the true situation of SARS and lying about the true infections and deaths caused by SARS. That is why Zhang was finally sacked for his failure to provide up-to-date and correct SARS figures and to be well prepared against the sudden public health hazards (Newsmax Wires, 2003). Put in other words, Zhang was stripped from his post of minister because of his destruction of the government's image.",
