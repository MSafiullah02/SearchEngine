These coronaviruses are classified into three distinct groups. One tightly clustered subgroup based on phylogenetic analysis and antigenic cross reactivity contains canine coronavirus (CCV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) (Pedersen et al., 1978, Siddell, 1995). The FCoVs are divided into two distinct serological groups referred to as types I and II and either type can manifest itself in cats as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), feline enteric disease, or a subclinical infection (Hohdatsu et al., 1991, De Groot and Horzinek, 1995).",

Likewise, S gene sequencing of CCV strains has shown that they have a closer relationship to type II FCoVs than to either type I FCoVs or to TGEV (Horsburgh et al., 1992, Wesseling et al., 1994, Horsburgh and Brown, 1995). In fact, the type II FCoVs apparently evolved by a double recombination between type I FCoVs and CCV (Herrewegh et al., 1998). Another genetic region that distinguishes among these coronaviruses is at the very 3\u2032 end of the genome. Both CCV and FIPV have open reading frames (ORFs) 7a and 7b, and thus, are different from TGEV which lacks ORF 7b and has a single smaller ORF 7 because of a 69 nucleotide deletion (De Groot et al., 1988, De Groot and Horzinek, 1995).",

Within this group, CCVs and FCoVs are similar at the very 3\u2032 end of the genome in that they contain two ORFs, 7a and 7b, downstream of the nucleocapsid gene. In addition, the S gene of CCV strains Insavc-1, K378, CCV-6 and C54 have been sequenced and shown to be more similar to FIPV than to TGEV based on identities at the N-terminal domain of this gene (Horsburgh et al., 1992, Wesseling et al., 1994, Horsburgh and Brown, 1995). Similarly, in this paper, CCV strains NVSL, TN449, 1-71 and UCD-2 were also shown to be FIPV-like in terms of the N-terminal end of the S protein. However, one field strain, UCD-1, isolated in the late 1970s in California was more like TGEV in this region (amino acids 1\u2013273) than like FIPV. Although the major coronavirus S gene epitopes are further downstream (residues 382\u2013389; 538\u2013543; 586\u2013591), nevertheless, these differences could account partially for antigenic and host range diversity and may affect the efficacy of CCV vaccines.",

In contrast, pigs were not infected by CCV strain 1-71 (Binn et al., 1974). Woods and Wesley (1986) hypothesized that these differences could be due to the inoculating dose of virus or to cell culture adaptation of the UCD-1 strain. Another explanation might be that CCVs vary in host range infectivity based on S gene sequence differences or other differences in the genome. The old NVSL challenge strain, DK-1, used by Woods and Wesley (1992) to infect dogs and then was transmitted to contact pigs is not the same as the current NVSL challenge strain (95-08).
