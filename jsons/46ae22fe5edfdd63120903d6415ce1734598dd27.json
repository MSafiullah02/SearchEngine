These IS outsourcing decisions are driven by multiple organisational factors such as outsource vendor expertise and knowledge, process performance improvement due to better IS, and enabling the organisation's ability to focus on its core capabilities. In order to harnass such vendor knowledge to achieve business outcomes, the importance of a shared knowledge asset base, between the client organisation and outsource vendor, is emphasised. However, outcomes from IS outsourcing remain poor despite consideration of experience and research. Therefore, the aim of this study is to design and propose a knowledge asset management implementation framework that may be applied in IS outsourcing projects. The proposed framework was evaluated by an experienced programme director and its applicability was tested against a large scale IS outsourcing project. The purpose of such a framework is to enable organisations to manage and institutionalise knowledge assets that are created during the IS outsourcing project and to ensure that the organisation may gain the benefit from such knowledge assets as an outcome of the IS outsourcing arrangement.",

Recent studies suggest that one of the reasons for this lack of improvement is due to the complex nature of outsourcing agreements as they shift from being a mere cost cutting exercise to one which holds significant strategic and social importance to the organisation [9, 10] . Furthermore, knowledge asset management is considered most valuable in the knowledge-driven economy, although the focus on tasks of knowledge asset understanding and management, have not been prioritised compared to their physical counterparts [11] . While scholars highlight the significance of knowledge asset management in addressing IS outsourcing complexity, little research has been conducted on how organisations manage knowledge assets and knowledge reuse in IS outsourcing circumstances [7, 12, 13] . Therefore, the research question that this paper aims to address is: \"What are the components of a knowledge asset management implementation framework for managing knowledge assets in IS outsourcing projects?\". By addressing this question, organisations are able to reference an approach to the management of knowledge assets during IS outsourcing projects, ensuring that institutional knowledge is not lost during outsourcing and that new knowledge that is created through the partnership, is captured and managed.",

The outcome of this organisational focus and commitment, is an important factor for IS outsourcing arrangements, seeing as the aim is to increase the collective knowledge of each other's knowledge domain [5, 15] . Technology-specific knowledge, such as the IS services provided, flows from the organisation to the outsource supplier, and business-specific knowledge about processes and procedures flows from the supplier to the organisation. The purpose of this knowledge transfer is to increase the knowledge shared by the organisation and the outsource vendor [5, 16] . Knowledge sharing and management in the context of IS outsourcing is not a stand-alone practice; it should be integrated into all aspects of the outsourcing arrangement [5, 15, 17] . The inseparability of IS from the internal production service in the client organisation implies that even in situations of absolute outsourcing, a minimum set of capabilities are retained in-house by the client organisation [18] .",

Design based research produces both theories and practical interventions as its outcomes [31] and encompasses five basic characteristics [30] . The first characteristic is pragmatic, referring to the research focus on solving current real-world problems through the design of interventions. The grounded characteristic points to the fact that the research is grounded in both theory and the real-world context, while interactive, iterative and flexible refer to the nature of the research process. Integrative highlights that researchers integrate a variety of research methods and approaches from both qualitative and quantitative research paradigms, depending on the needs of the research. The final characteristic, contextual, emphasises that research outcomes are connected with both the design process through which results are generated and the setting where the research is conducted.",

The scope of work outsourced included business process modelling, high level solution design and architecture, an implementation programme work plan and a data migration strategy. A programme director, an experienced, independent consultant, appointed by the organisation to work with both outsource vendors, systems integrator, as well as the organisation's IS outsourcing project team members, applied the proposed KAMI framework to the project in order to establish its applicability to a real-world situation. We believed that such an experienced programme director overseeing a complex IS outsourcing agreement will be in a position to provide valuable insight into the practical application of the proposed KAMI framework. As the IS outsourcing project was in progress already i.e. in the post-contract phase, the programme director mapped the proposed KAMI framework to the project and could, in addition to providing feedback, also share lessons learnt in terms of the early stages of the IS outsourcing project.",

For the strategise phase as part of the pre-contract stage, the programme director indicated that by considering an overview of the knowledge asset management principles as well as high level scope, presents great advantages. Market knowledge, knowledge of the strategic objectives informing the IS outsourcing and knowledge about the operational benefits that will be derived from the outsourcing, are important. A key enabler identified by the programme director pointed to the outsource vendor knowledge of the client organisation. Such knowledge ensures that engagement takes place at the correct organisational level, that the external skills from the outsource vendor complement existing skill sets and that emphasis is placed on the up-skilling of the client organisation in terms of managing an outsource partner. As knowledge exchange in the pre-contract phase of IS outsourcing deals with the structure of the agreement, negotiation position knowledge and negotiation skills are key. In terms of requirements analysis at this stage of the project, identification and documentation of organizational intellectual property, knowledge of different outsource models, quantification of the business case for outsourcing and multiple benchmarks and performance measure identification present major knowledge exchanges. These particular knowledge exchanges are considered as part of the high level knowledge asset requirements analysis.",

Due diligence, live demonstrations and presentations, research and intelligence re outsource vendors and the knowledge embedded in a lessons learnt repository, informed the initiative scoping procedure. The knowledge audit and initiative scoping steps were relevant in the handover between the post-contract and contract phases. Prioritisation focuses on the understanding of the key objectives of knowledge transfer into measurable services and products in order to inform vendor selection. Technology solution assessment in the contract phase pointed to the assessment of a solution benchmarking repository and an outcomes based assessment of the usability of the perceived end product.",

During the building procedure, traceability of knowledge elements, agreed way of work, organisational monitoring capabilities and joint delivery presented opportunities for knowledge exchange. The planning and knowledge elicitation procedures are positioned within the hand over between the contract and post-contract stages. The implement phase includes key knowledge exchange identified and points to conducting formal knowledge transfer workshops of learning that has taken place during the project in order to create a lessons learnt knowledge base. As this procedure is in the post-contract phase, formal knowledge transfer mechanisms from outsource vendor to client organisation must be facilitated and sufficient planning for hand over time must be allocated. With a strong focus on maintenance and support, knowledge transfer regarding the monitoring of the service level agreement, housekeeping and general operational tasks, and decommissioning of vendor resources must be enabled. A knowledge repository with all relevant solution information, decisions made during the project and risks identified and mitigated, including proper security controls, must be created. Here well-defined quantifiable business benefits linked to well defined and measureable business processes, facilitation of proof of concept and demonstrations of the solution, as well as the creation of a common knowledge repository between the client organisation and outsource vendor as part of the outsourcing arrangement, are important knowledge exchanges. The programme director highlighted the utilisation of joint documentation responsibilities between the client organisation and outsource vendor. The KAMI activities in the implement phase of the KAMI framework are cyclical in nature and has to be managed throughout the entire period of IS outsourcing contract execution.",

            "text": "In addition, the senior programme director commented on the advantages of the KAMI framework based on his experience with large scale IS outsourcing programmes and also made KAMI framework improvement suggestions. Firstly, he reflected on the cyclical nature of the KAMI framework as he experienced that knowledge assets are often lost when an IS outsourcing contract is terminated or ends. The cycles indicated in the KAMI framework ensures that the organisation considers to capture these knowledge assets before the outsource vendor exists. The programme director reflected on the management of 3 knowledge flows namely, new knowledge created by the joint IS outsourcing team, organisation-to-vendor knowledge exchange, and vendor-toorganisation knowledge exchange. He believed that although it was implied in the KAMI framework, it will add value to make it explicit, especially as different mechanisms may be applied in order to manage these different knowledge flows. The programme director highlighted that he believes two distinct sets of knowledge assets must be managed: firstly, the knowledge assets created by the IS outsourcing project related to the business rationale for using outsourcing, e.g. the implementation of a new software solution. Secondly, he indicated that knowledge assets are also utilised in the management of the IS outsourcing agreement, e.g. the project documentation, outsourcing process knowledge, negotiation guidelines, contract management knowledge etc. He mentioned that he believes it will add great value of the KAMI framework guided both of these knowledge asset sets. By including the second knowledge asset set, namely the IS outsourcing project assets, it will enable the commercial team to negotiate and include key knowledge asset management principles in the commercial agreement with the outsource vendor. The programme director stressed that the fact that a contract which includes knowledge asset management clauses, will assist in enforcing the vendor to share knowledge as some contract payments may be linked to the delivery of knowledge sharing. Lastly, he suggested that the inclusion of an agreement on a knowledge taxonomy related to the project within the context of the bigger organisation should form part of the strategise phase of KAMI. This will be important for the institutionalisation of the knowledge assets created during the IS outsourcing project and when the assets have to be integrated into the organisational knowledge context.",

In order to assist organisations embarking on IS outsourcing to pro-actively manage their knowledge assets during the IS outsourcing project, the aim of this study was to develop a KAMI framework. The KAMI framework was designed based on the analysis of multiple KM frameworks and then evaluated by an experienced senior programme director. The objective with this proof of concept evaluation was to establish whether the KAMI framework was applicable to IS outsourcing projects where multiple knowledge exchanges take place, namely; organisation-to-vendor knowledge exchange, vendor-to-organisation knowledge exchange and new knowledge that was created by the IS outsourcing implementation project. The proof of concept evaluation was done through an interview with the senior programme director and the data regarding knowledge exchange in an IS outsourcing project that he managed, was analysed and reported in the context of the KAMI framework. The data included comments regarding each of the stages of the IS outsourcing lifecycle.",
