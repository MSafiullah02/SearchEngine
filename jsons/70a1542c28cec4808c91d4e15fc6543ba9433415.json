Comparing the trajectory of the epidemic before and after the lockdown, we find no evidence of any discontinuity in the growth rate, doubling time, and reproduction number trends. Extrapolating pre-lockdown growth rate trends, we provide estimates of the death toll in the absence of any lockdown policies, and show that these strategies might not have saved any life in western Europe. We also show that neighboring countries applying less restrictive social distancing measures (as opposed to police-enforced home containment) experience a very similar time evolution of the epidemic.",

Since most countries were unprepared to face such an unexpected epidemic, lack of testing capacities yielded most policies to shift towards social distancing measures rather than modern laboratory-based quarantine [10] . A broad range of public actions were * Correspondence to T. Meunier, tmeunier@whoi.edu taken in response to the epidemic, from no action at all (Sweden) to full lockdown (Italy, France, Spain and United Kingdom), including police-enforced home containment. Other countries, such as the Netherlands and Germany, opted for a measured response, encouraging social distancing without locking their population down. While new medical treatments proposed to cure COVID-19 cases are required to be validated through controlled double blind studies, the benefits and risks of social distancing strategies are not subject to any comparative tests. However, full lockdown measures, such as those decided in Italy, France, Spain and United Kingdom have not been experienced in Western Europe countries for centuries, and their effects in contemporary population's mental and physical health is largely unknown. The COVID-19 epidemic episode was shown to, by itself, affect mental health, including anxiety syndromes and depression [21] and the consequences of isolation could enhance these conditions. In the absence of any control group, the impacts on western Europe's population will not be measurable until months. Nevertheless, increased mortality due to difficulties of access to basic health care, increased mental conditions linked to isolation, as well as social consequences of economic recession, despite being unquantifiable so far, is to be expected. Such measures are thus only appropriate if their impacts on limiting the epidemic spreading save more lives than their inherent death toll. Attempting a real-time assessment of full lockdown policies efficiency thus seems crucial to help public action decisions in the forthcoming weeks.",

In an attempt to predict the efficiency of similar policies in Western Europe countries (Italy, France, Spain and United Kingdom), Picchioti el al. (2020) [16] implemented a SEIR model, testing different lockdown parameterizations, and suggested that early public containment measures could be efficient. However, as acknowledged by the authors, real-time parameterization of a model for an unknown disease is a difficult and uncertain task, and the effects of lockdown may vary from one country to another. Although modeling studies offer valuable insights and possible scenarii for forthcoming events, and might provide a deep understanding of the epidemic's dynamics a posteriori, they require validation, which can only be provided by thorough data analysis. In that regard, the observational efforts of Tobias (2020) [20] represent an interesting approach. The latter recently claimed that the full lockdown policies in Spain and Italy have had positive results in slowing the epidemic. However, their methods, based on fitting linear trends to the logarithm of the daily new cases and daily death numbers, and comparing them before, and after the lockdown policies, might not be appropriate. As will be shown below, to assess the trajectory of the epidemic, one should look for trends in the time derivative of the logarithm of daily numbers, rather than trends in the logarithm of the daily numbers itself.",

The daily and total deaths numbers in France are thus greatly underestimated in our study, but one should keep in mind that we are focused on time evolution and trends rather than absolute values, so that time-consistency is the single most important requirement for the data.",

For all four variables, time evolution exhibits a similar pattern: a steady decreasing trend from 3.5 to 6 secondary infections per case in the beginning of the epidemic to less than unity 20 to 40 days before the reference date (April 24). In all four countries, no discontinuity in the general decaying trend is observed around the full lockdown's start date. Even though this date coincides approximately with the 1-crossing of R in France, Italy, and Spain, the latter is only the follow-up of a longer term decay.

A general decaying trend of \u03b3(t) is evident from the beginning of the epidemic in all 4 countries, although some variability exists around the linear trend, with a nearly periodic oscillation of 5 to 8 days. Linear regression satisfyingly models the time evolution of \u03b3, with coefficients of determination r 2 (fraction of the variance explained by the model) of 0.67, 0.72, 0.73, and 0.61 for France, Italy, Spain, and United Kingdom, respectively. Linearity of \u03b3(t) suggests that time evolution of the epidemic is consistent with a Gauss function. Comparing the linear decaying trend before, and after the time by which full lockdown policies should have visible impacts, we find that the slope of \u03b3(t) decreases in France, Italy, and Spain after the full lockdown, and remains constant in United Kingdom. The decay of the epidemic has thus slowed since the lockdown is effective. Comparison of the general decay trends in France, Italy, Spain and United Kingdom with that of the Netherlands provides a further insight on the effects of full lockdown: Netherlands decay trend is slightly slower than France and Spain before lockdown, and is nearly similar to Italy and United Kingdom's. In all four countries, the decay trend after the effective lockdown is slower than Netherlands trend.",

We computed an estimate of the doubling time, assuming the pre-lockdown trend in \u03b3(t) remains constant after the lockdown is effective (we assume that \u03b3(t) keeps on linearly decaying after lockdown with the same slope as before lockdown). Comparing these estimates (dashed green line) with the observed values (blue squares) shows that the initial pre-lockdown trend yields a steeper rise in the doubling time than what is observed after lockdown policies should have visible impacts. The visual impression of an accelerating T 2 growth in the data is thus not to be attributed to the lockdown effects, but rather to the inherent growth of the T 2 function when \u0393(t) reaches small values. Figure 3 thus also underlines the lack of evidence of any effects of the full lockdown.",

Again, the forecast dead number obtained from extrapolating \u03b3(t)'s linear trend in the future is presented for indicative purpose.

We selected countries that had over 1000 fatalities by April 15, 2020 , and chose to exclude data from China, given the growing doubts on their accuracy. The time reference was chosen to be the day by which the total death toll exceeded 100 in each country. Evolution of \u03b3(t) shows a similar general decay trend in all countries. It is interesting to note that, while the linear trends of the growth rates have similar slopes in nearly all countries, they show a wide range of intercepts (value of \u03b3 at t = 0), showing that although the slowdown of the epidemic follows a similar trajectory, each country started at very different levels of growth rate. This general decay trend is accompanied by a regular decay in the reproduction number in all countries, with similar slopes and, again, a wide range of initial reproduction numbers. As expected from a decreasing growth rate and reproduction number, the doubling time is increasing in all countries from the beginning of the time series. Figure 6 thus shows that time evolution of the epidemic is homogeneous in Western Europe, and that the main differences reside in the initial conditions at the beginning of the epidemic.",

Our results show a general decay trend in the growth rates and reproduction numbers two to three weeks before the full lockdown policies would be expected to have visible effects. Comparison of pre and post lockdown observations reveals a counter-intuitive slowdown in the decay of the epidemic after lockdown. Estimates of daily and total deaths numbers using pre-lockdown trends suggest that no lives were saved by this strategy, in comparison with pre-lockdown, less restrictive, social distancing policies. Comparison of the epidemic's evolution between the fully locked down countries and neighboring countries applying social distancing measures only, confirms the absence of any effects of home containment. Evolution of the epidemic in Sweden however indicates that, in the absence of any social distancing measures, the epidemic's decay may be subject to larger fluctuations. This work thus suggests that social distancing measures, such as those applied in the Netherlands and Germany, or in Italy, France, Spain, and United Kingdom before the full lockdown strategies, have approximately the same effects as police-enforced home containment policies.",

While social distancing efforts may contribute to it, environmental conditions could as well have played a role (possible seasonality of the virus). The group immunity hypothesis, though being unlikely if the reference fatality rates are correct, deserves a short discussion: computing the number of daily new cases from the number of daily deaths following Eq (2), and using a fatality rate of 1.7%, we forecast a ratio of infected population at the end of the epidemic of 1.4%, 3.0%, 3.2%, and 2.1% in France, Italy, Spain, and United Kingdom, respectively. The latter is obviously far from being able to yield any group immunity. Under the rough assumption that 50 to 70% of the population needs to be infected to ensure group immunity, it is possible to compute an hypothetical fatality rate using Eq (2) . We find that, if group immunity was responsible for the decay of the epidemic, the fatality rates would be of about 0.05%, 0.10%, 0.11%, and 0.07% for the 50% hypothesis in France, Italy, Spain, and United Kingdom, respectively, and of 0.03%, 0.07%, 0.08%, and 0.05% for the 70% hypothesis. Obviously, this is only a gedanken experiment, which is far beyond the scope of this paper, and only serological tests and further data analysis, once the epidemic is completely instinct, will allow to discriminate between the possible reasons for its decay.",
