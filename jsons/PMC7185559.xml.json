            "text": "Waterborne viruses are frequently implicated as the cause of water-related gastrointestinal illness. Waterborne disease outbreaks (WBDOs) are reported each year and are associated with recreational water (RW), treated drinking water (DW), and ground water (treated and untreated). Depending on the water source, the actual source of contamination can vary; however, the two common threads are (1) the introduction of fecal material into the water source and (2) inadequate or interrupted treatment of water intended for drinking [1, 2, 3, 4]. In 2003, the World Health Organization estimated that worldwide 3.4 million deaths each year can be attributed to the water-related (water, sanitation, hygiene) transmission of pathogens (all pathogens, not just enteric viruses) [5]. For the European Union (EU), the European Environment and Health Information System estimated the annual burden of disease due to water-related pathogens at 13,548 deaths for children 0\u201314 years old. For the United States, Reynolds (2008) estimated 7 million illnesses and more than 1000 deaths each year were due to waterborne pathogens though these are based on model simulations and not actual values. Unfortunately, the number of illnesses and deaths due specifically to waterborne viruses is difficult to determine and thus basically unknown.",

Although viruses implicated in WBDOs are capable of causing a variety of acute illnesses (Table 1), acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) is most commonly reported. Enteric viruses are host-specific (i.e. in this instance, specific to humans) and are not capable of replicating in the environment outside of its host. In addition, enteric viruses have a presumed low infectious dose (i.e. <10\u2013103 virus particles) [6, 7, 8, 9]; prolonged (3\u20134 weeks), asymptomatic periods of shedding; and enhanced environmental stability due to their non-enveloped capsid structure [10]. These characteristics allow enteric viruses to play a significant role in water-related outbreaks. Noroviruses have been the largest cause of virus-related WBDOs in the U.S. since 2003, and data indicate a similar trend in selected countries (France, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands, UK) [11\u2022, 12, 13]. Aside from NoVs, HAV, HEV, and RV are still of significant concern in low-income countries without adequate water and sanitation. Additional viruses of lesser epidemiologic importance though still capable of waterborne transmission include human reovirus, parvovirus, parechovirus, polyomavirus, coronavirus, and torovirus [14, 15].",

(1984) \u2014 one of the seminal publications on the prevalence of viruses in DW in the U.S. \u2014 reported 83% of the samples to be positive for either RV or EVs [27]. Shortly thereafter, Bitton et al. (1986) followed up with a review on viruses in DW both in the U.S. and internationally [28]. Aside from these earlier studies, few studies on virus occurrence in DW in the U.S. have been reported since, and of those, such as Gibson and Schwab (2011), no viruses were detected [29]. This paucity of available data for viruses in DW can most likely be attributed to the need for very large volumes (>100 to 6000 L) of water to be concentrated followed by subsequent recovery and detection of virus targets \u2014 a process that is challenging often resulting in low recovery efficiency and detection sensitivity [26\u2022].",

(1986) highlighted several studies out of the E.U. In particular, research from 1965 in Paris, France was the driving force for the investigation of the occurrence of viruses in DW worldwide for the next 20 years and beyond. As this review is primarily focused on the past decade, data published no later than 2002 have been included. Lee and Kim (2002) reported 4 and 7% of tested DW samples positive for NoV GI and GII, respectively, in South Korea [30]. Studies on viruses in DWTPs in Egypt [31] reported no viruses positive samples. Conversely, in South Africa [32], 11\u201316% of DWTP samples were positive for enteric viruses (predominantly coxsackievirus B). In 2009, Albinana-Gimenez et al. reported 11% of DW samples collected in Spain positive for AdV [33]. Additionally, a study by Dong et al. (2010) on viruses in New Zealand DW found 18\u201336% of samples positive for AdV depending on the method of analysis [34]. Last, Ye et al. (2012) reported the presence of human enteric viruses in DW from Wuhan, China with 100% of the 48 samples positive for RVs and AdVs and 21% of samples positive for EVs [35]. Overall, depending on the type of DW treatment process, source water quality, and sampling and detection methods, there is a wide range of viral pathogen occurrence in DW from around the world.",

            "text": "One of the greatest fallacies regarding groundwater (GW) as drinking water is that GW is more likely to be free of pathogenic microorganisms due in part to the presumed natural filtering abilities of subsurface environments [19]. Pathogen contaminated GW can often be attributed to failing or poorly sited septic systems in karst settings that do not allow for proper attenuation of pathogens, especially viruses, due to their rapid movement from surface to aquifer [36\u2022, 37]. Several studies over the past decade have demonstrated widespread occurrence of human enteric viruses in both individual and municipal wells in the U.S. In 2003, Abbaszadegan et al. reported 4.8% and 32% of 448 GW samples to be virus positive by infectivity assay and PCR, respectively [20]. Additional U.S. centric studies have reported 8\u201349% virus positive GW sites [38, 39, 40, 41, 42]. A more recent study by Borchardt et al. (2012) reported 24% of the samples (n\n = 1200) positive for human enteric viruses (AdV, EV, and NoV GI) and also estimated 6\u201322% of the AGI in the study communities (n\n = 14) to be attributable to exposure to viruses in nondisinfected tap water [43\u2022\u2022]. One reason for this vulnerability \u2014 aside from the complexity of pathogen\u2013subsurface interactions \u2014 is that before the Ground Water Rule (GWR) of 2006 [44], public utilities with a GW source were not required to disinfect their water supply; moreover, many individual wells are still used untreated. As reported in Fout et al. (2003), untreated GW was responsible for approximately 50% of WBDOs in the U.S. and this trend continues today [38].",

            "text": "Viral pathogens in the water environment will continue to adversely impact public health. Even though viruses are not the only pathogens present in water that can cause disease, the risk of illness is 10\u201310,000 times greater for viruses than bacteria at a similar level of exposure [65]. Because of this increased risk and in consideration of the data presented herein, there are a few points of discussion that can be made. First, human enteric viruses are clearly a concern for both DW and RW microbial water quality; however, we still rely on a bacterial indicator system to alert us if there is a potential contamination issue. The use of bacterial indicators has been debated for decades, and we are still at a stalemate when it comes to actually predicting the presence of human viral pathogens in water. For the protection of public health, a true viral indicator should continue to be pursued. Second, in order to move toward an indicator for viruses, we need to harmonize the concentration, recovery, and detection methods employed for the analysis of waterborne viruses. Harmonizing steps have been taken by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency with the introduction of Method 1615 though this method is specific to EVs and NoVs. Last, countries should start investing in both aging DW distribution systems and wastewater infrastructure, especially in large cities, as this would likely decrease a portion of the WBDOs that are reported each year, at least in high income countries.",
