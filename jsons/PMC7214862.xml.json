Ultraviolet (UV) germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is one possible method for respirator disinfection to facilitate the reuse of dwindling supplies. Dermatology offices often use narrow-band UVB to treat skin diseases. If necessary, we propose a possible repurposing of phototherapy devices, including these UVB units, to serve as a platform for UVC germicidal disinfection.",

Previous studies have shown that UVC can inactivate coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).1 One study of respirators contaminated with H1N1 influenza A found significant reductions (\u22653-log reduction) in viable influenza virus under substantial artificial soiling conditions after being treated for 60 to 70 seconds at an irradiance of 17 mW/cm2, resulting in a UVGI dose of \u223c1 J/cm2 measured at 254 nm.2 The efficacy of this dose has been verified in additional studies, and higher doses (up to 2 J/cm2) have been shown to provide diminished benefit after 1 J/cm2.3\n,\n4 It is recommended to treat used masks, but not visibly soiled, to allow the 3-log reduction reported in the literature to be sufficient to achieve safe reuse levels.5\n",

            "text": "However, UV radiation does degrade polymers, which presents the possibility that UVGI exposure, while decontaminating, may also reduce the efficacy of the respirator and decrease protection to workers. Lindsley et al6 exposed 4 different models of N95 filtering facepiece respirators to UVGI doses of 120 to 950 J/cm2. Results of the study showed that UVGI exposure led to a small increase in particle penetration (up to 1.25%) and had little effect on the flow resistance. However, at higher UVGI doses, the strength of the layers of the respirator material was substantially reduced (in some cases, >90%), but this significantly varied among the different models. UVGI had less of an effect on the respirator straps: a dose of 2360 J/cm2 reduced the breaking strength of the straps by 20% to 51%.6 It should be noted that the dosages used in the study above are 100- to 1000-times higher than those shown to disinfect H1N1 influenza A\u2013contaminated respirators. Therefore, considering that many of our health care providers are using substitutes for N95 filtering facepiece respirators that offer very limited degree of protection, using UVGI and repurposing phototherapy devices could be the best practical solution at this time.",
