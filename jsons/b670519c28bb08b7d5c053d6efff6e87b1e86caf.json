All other life forms contain DNA as genetic material and RNA as a message or intermediate for the formation of proteins or other structures. Viruses are also unique in that they contain either RNA or DNA as the genetic material. To date, no virus has been discovered that contains both types of nucleic acid as genetic material, although both types are used during virus replication in the cell. Viruses do not contain ribosomes, mitochondria or other cell-like organelles, and are thus completely parasitic. Since they cannot replicate without the metabolic processes of the host cell, they are genetic parasites. This differentiates viruses from bacteria or other single-cell microorganisms (e.g., protozoa), most of which can replicate in culture on their own, although they can also be parasitic. One other feature distinguishing viruses from other organisms in general is their small size and ability to pass through filters. This was certainly a major criterion in the early days of virology, although large viruses have recently been discovered. Viruses were not retained by filters made from diatomaceous earth (kieselguhr), extensively used at the beginning of the twentieth century. This characteristic was originally used as the major characteristic in differentiating a virus from bacteria, fungus or protozoa. Andr\u00e9 Lwoff, a French microbiologist (who studied lysogeny, which is the insertion of bacteriophage DNA into the chromosome of a host), defined a virus in negative terms, using the following characteristics [1] : \u2022 Possessing only one type of nucleic acid.",

Retroviruses are RNA viruses but replicate through a DNA. \u2022 Unable to undergo binary fission and \u2022 Lacking an energy system, including mitochondria and ribosomes. This is a negative definition, and stresses the non-cellular nature of viruses. Fundamentally, then, a virus is a package of genetic information protected by a protein shell for delivery into a host cell to be expressed and replicated. The virus eventually takes over the cell completely for its own replication and in the process may kill (lyse) the cell or, in the case of tumor viruses, can permanently alter the cell [2]. It was impossible to define a virus in terms of shape or physical characteristics until one could be seen; this had to await the development of the electron microscope. In 1931, two German scientists, Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll, invented the electron microscope ( Fig. 2.2 ). This was a great improvement over the light microscope and allowed one to actually ''see'' viruses. One major disadvantage, however, is that the preparation for visualizing material by EM may distort the specimen because viable material cannot be used. The EM, as it became, uses electrons speeded up in a vacuum, aimed at the specimen, and gives an outline of the structure on an electron-sensitive photographic plate. Ernst Ruska later moved to the Siemens Company in Germany, where the first commercial electron microscope was developed. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986.",

It is considered and called a virus since it cannot replicate outside its host, and although it carries genes for many metabolic functions, it does not code for ribosomal genes, making it dependent on the host cell for protein synthesis. It is as large as many bacteria, but despite this, it seems to be another example of an entity at the boundary between living and inert forms. One has to consider a continuum from the inert chemical (organic chemical) to more complex ones with the ability to reproduce, which then gives life. The definition of life or living is an arbitrary one (see Chap. 4 on bacteriophage), and is defined in different ways by different scientists and philosophers. The discovery of the Mimivirus has given rise to the discussion as to whether this is an ancestor of other viruses or is the result of genes breaking away from the host and becoming independent. An electron micrograph of Mimivirus is shown in Fig. 2 .3, and a schematic in Fig. 2 ",

Initially, this takes the form of binding of a virus-attachment protein to a cellular receptor molecule. One can imagine this as a key and lock mechanism. Once the virus attaches to the cell, it is engulfed through the cellular membrane and the viral coat removed in small cellular vesicles, releasing the viral nucleic acid into the cytoplasm for replication (Fig. 2.11 ).

Such viruses either ''kill'' the host or are eventually controlled by the immune system and are thus self-limiting. Some viruses persist for a long period of time, giving rise to chronic infections. We do not know why this happens, since in many cases the components of the immune system appear to be functioning normally. It is possible that the virus has the ability to ''dampen'' the activity of the immune system or the first lines of defense against infection, such as interferon.

Virus proteins are made and modify the host cell metabolism so that host proteins are no longer made, or the host cell replication cycle is affected. All of this is to allow the virus to produce more of itself, thus diverting cell metabolism to virus production. The viral proteins are produced in one part of the cell, the replicated nucleic acid in another, and somehow they find each other, interact, and form virus particles that are expelled from the cell. These viruses then infect nearby cells. Immediately after infection in vivo, the body reacts by producing interferon and other immune enhancing molecules known as cytokines, which are the first line of defense against the virus; this response is called ''innate immunity.'' Adaptive immunity, the production of antibodies for a specific virus, will not occur until much later (10-21 days). Symptoms usually occur a few days after infection, although during this asymptomatic period a person may be infectious. This is particularly true in the case of viruses such as HIV, where obvious symptoms may not occur for quite some time (The role of the immune response is discussed in detail in Chap. 6).",

Transmission takes place by contact, both direct and indirect. In experiments designed by Hall et al. [6] highly symptomatic infants who were producing abundant secretions were placed in cribs. Three categories of nurse volunteers were brought into the room. ''Cuddlers'' played with the infant, changed his or her diaper and performed other routine care. ''Touchers'' did not touch the baby but had extensive contact with the child's environment, which had been heavily contaminated with secretions. ''Sitters'' sat next to the crib reading a book for 3 h but did not touch anything in the immediate environment. Five of the seven ''cuddlers,'' four of ten ''touchers'' and not one of 14 ''sitters'' developed RSV infection. Thus transmission did not appear to be airborne, since none of the nurses sitting beside the children was infected. The other nurses were infected either by direct contact with the child, or from secretions that were on the crib or other objects handled by the child. Children with RSV secrete large amounts of virus, which can be viable for up to 7 h on tabletops or other surfaces (Fig. 2.12) . RSV is often spread in hospitals (nosocomial spread) through lack of thorough hand-washing after handling infected children. It is important that all surfaces be washed down with an effective antiviral compound after exposure to children with RSV. Detergents containing alcohol are effective in destroying RSV, and anyone in contact with this infection should wear gloves as a barrier to infection.",

Adults with naturally acquired rhinovirus colds have been found to contaminate 35 % of environmental surfaces in hotel rooms after overnight occupancy, using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) to detect viral RNA. In addition, viral RNA on surfaces (light switch, phone button, and telephone handset) could be transferred to fingertips during activities of daily life. Although RTPCR measures viral RNA contamination, parallel experiments testing for growth of virus in cell culture resulted in similar results. Virus could be found on these objects for as long as 18 h. There are, however, two conflicting sets of data on how rhinoviruses are spread, one maintaining that the virus is predominantly spread by indirect contact through nasal secretions, the other that the major mode of transmission is through aerosol. Studies at the University of Wisconsin have shown that when individuals with a cold are kept in the same room with uninfected individuals, the virus does spread by aerosol, but not as fast as expected. It may take hours of exposure for others to contract the cold. However, in these experiments, virus was not detectable on game chips, suggesting that in the case of contact infection, there is a need for large amounts of fresh secretion [8] . Thus, again, hand-washing should be effective against the spread of this virus.",
