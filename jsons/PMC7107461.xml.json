As of 2011, a survey of 38 freestanding children\u2019s hospitals revealed that 16 (42%) had a formal ASP, whereas an additional 14 (37%) were actively implementing programs [9]. Among the 16 hospitals with an ASP, physician full-time equivalent (FTE) support for their stewardship role was provided in 14 (median, 0.25 FTE [range, 0.1\u20130.5 FTE]), whereas 13 (81%) hospitals had a dedicated pharmacist FTE (median, 0.5 FTE [range, 0.1\u20131.5 FTE]). Prospective audit and feedback, formulary restriction, and clinical guidelines were commonly cited (87%) by these programs as strategies used. Although most ASPs follow the model of using dedicated clinical pharmacy and infectious disease (ID) specialists, at least 1 pediatric ASP uses an alternative model to operationalize its program and integrates ASP activities into the daily function of service-based clinical pharmacists and of ID physicians during weekends and holidays [10]. Several reports that described ASPs in adult institutions also described a model of including multiple clinical pharmacists\u2019 participation in their ASP activities [11, 12]. Furthermore, a pediatric model of daily face-to-face \u201chandshake stewardship\u201d has been successful in optimizing antimicrobial use and increasing the number of ID consultations [13, 14].",

DOT is the measure used more commonly in the United States and is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The DOT metric represents the overall total number of antibiotics administered over a total number of days. For example, a patient who receives 2 antibiotics for 5 days each will have 10 DOT. A limitation of DOT is that it cannot account for spectrum of activity, so the use of a narrow-spectrum multidrug regimen will increase the DOT metric more than the use of a single very-broad-spectrum agent. Similarly, the DOT measure alone cannot capture desired therapy changes, such as deescalation from a single broad-spectrum agent to a more targeted one, but this limitation can be addressed by tracking consumption of specific targeted agents [10]. Complementary metrics, such as the antibiotic spectrum index, have been developed to measure patterns of antibiotic selection and deescalation and address these limitations [16].",

Alternatively, the CDC created an electronic tool, called the antibiotic-use option, and encourages acute care facilities to report their antibiotic-usage data to the National Healthcare Safety Network by using the numerator of DOT and the denominator of 1000 days present to encourage risk-adjusted interfacility and intrafacility benchmarking of antibiotic use [19]. The days-present metric is calculated as the number of patients who were present for any portion of a day during a calendar month at a specific location. For example, if a patient were to be admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) on Monday afternoon, remain there Tuesday and Wednesday, and be transferred to the general pediatric ward Wednesday and discharged home later that day, he or she would contribute 3 days toward the PICU days-present denominator and 1 day toward the pediatric-ward denominator. Note the subtle difference between patient days and days present; patient days are often 1 less than the hospital length of stay (2 days in the example above, because the patient was present only at midnight on 2 days), whereas the days-present denominator enables capture of the entire time in the hospital and time in different locations (3 days present in the PICU plus 1 day present in the medical ward in the example above). In this regard, the days-present measure enables a more nuanced assessment and benchmarking of where antibiotic use occurs within a hospital.",

These data, when stratified according to clinical unit or service line, can suggest areas for ongoing improvement. ASPs should monitor proactively for compensatory changes in antibiotic-prescribing behavior on the basis of their activities (ie, balancing measures such as an increase in piperacillin-tazobactam use after carbapenem access restriction), and periodically reevaluate whether program strategies should be updated (such as adding new formulary restrictions).",

Programs can track clinical data, including mortality rate, hospital length of stay, and readmissions, especially when focused on patients confirmed to have an infection (eg, bloodstream infection) [21\u201323]. Programs should especially consider tracking the CDI rate because it is a concretely measurable outcome and is associated with increased LOS and cost and death among children, and ASP efforts have been found to reduce the incidence of CDIs [24, 25]. Tracking CDI rates among children is not without some difficulty, however, given the various diagnostic tests available and the prevalence of C difficile colonization among young children [26]. Other potentially relevant clinical outcomes include antibiotic appropriateness and incidence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. ASPs might need to communicate that, even if an improvement in clinical outcome is not observed, a lack of worsening clinical outcomes (eg, finding that reducing the duration of therapy for patients with community-acquired pneumonia from 10 to 5 days does not increase hospital readmissions) might be just as meaningful. Also, it must be acknowledged that assigning causality to changes in clinical outcomes can be challenging, because certain events, such as death, are relatively rare in children.",

A reasonable starting point for any new effort is to develop evidence-based local guidelines that include input from a multidisciplinary team, which is best achieved through in-person meetings. ASP members might find that integrating their efforts into existing clinical specialty workgroups and meetings is a good entry point. Process and outcome measures should be relevant to the specific service(s) targeted; thus, inclusion of a physician or pharmacist champion from an individual service who will assist in developing relevant stewardship metrics is critical [3, 41]. As an example, when developing guidelines with a PICU that involve reducing the duration of therapy for children with ventilator-associated pneumonia, the ASP might believe that the emergence of resistant pathogens is an important outcome, whereas the PICU faculty might think that reintubation rates are more meaningful.",

            "text": "Other novel populations for ASPs to target are defined not by their underlying disease process but by other facets of their care. For example, ASPs can focus on children being discharged to undergo outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT). Overuse of OPAT exposes patients to complications such as catheter-associated infections and thrombosis, and OPAT can be avoided in some children in favor of oral therapy for infections such as osteomyelitis [32, 42, 43]. Similarly, investigating and removing unnecessary \u03b2-lactam allergy labels represents an opportunity for ASPs to direct patients toward first-line, generally more narrow-spectrum, agents [44, 45]. ASPs can contribute to our understanding of optimal antibiotic dosing and pharmacokinetics by periodically updating local standards around antibiotic use (eg, considering use of the vancomycin area under the curve/minimum inhibitory concentration ratio or use of extended-infusion \u03b2-lactams) [46, 47]. Electronic health record order sets have been modified to decrease the duration of antibiotics for those with some common infections, and use of automatic antibiotic order discontinuation after a brief period of empiric use seems safe and effective at reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use [23, 48]. Hospitals with a large referral base can even consider using their local ASP resources to provide stewardship remotely to other community hospitals [49]. Last, because more than 80% of all pediatric antibiotic use occurs in an ambulatory setting, some ASPs are expanding to provide resources and guidance for patients in these settings [50\u201352].",

Procalcitonin (PCT) is a diagnostic test that is used increasingly as a biomarker to distinguish bacterial infections from other infectious and inflammatory conditions. Although most studies to date have been in adults, the literature on the utility of PCT in the evaluation of infants with fever, pneumonia, and severe bacterial infections is growing [66\u201368]. Several studies in adults have found that when PCT testing is combined with treatment algorithms developed by ASPs, patients are exposed to significantly shorter antibiotic courses with no increase in adverse clinical outcomes [69, 70]. PCT testing may similarly enhance judicious antibiotic prescribing for children and deserves further study.",

            "text": "The sustainability of stewardship requires its adoption across providers and disciplines, beyond ID physicians and clinical pharmacists, and requires ongoing education. For 2017, The Joint Commission developed a new antimicrobial stewardship standard that requires hospitals to educate antibiotic prescribers about appropriate antibiotic use, such as through use of existing CDC tools or other locally developed materials [6]. Engaging other hospital pharmacists who are not members of the ASP is a way to extend ASP activities across the hospital. Furthermore, nurses are increasingly identified as critical partners in stewardship activities [71, 72]. According to the CDC core elements for antibiotic stewardship, nurses are encouraged to review medications as part of their routine duties and can prompt discussions of antibiotic treatment, indication, duration, and patient readiness to transition to oral therapy [73, 74]. Hospitalists can likewise be vital partners in stewardship efforts, because their discipline is expanding rapidly, and they often are involved with quality improvement efforts and the efficient use of healthcare resources. A previous multisite hospitalist collaborative successfully enhanced antimicrobial documentation, accessibility to local guidelines, and implementation of a 72-hour antibiotic timeout [75]. The Vermont Oxford Network\u2019s Newborn Improvement Collaborative for Quality is an interdisciplinary association that has focused on antimicrobial stewardship for its 2016 and 2017 organization goals [76]. Integration of formal stewardship training activities into medical education, such as online curricula and lectures for medical students or rotations in stewardship for residents and fellows, is also essential for ensuring adequate preparation for the future generation of antibiotic prescribers [77, 78].",
