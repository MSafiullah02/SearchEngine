            "text": "The etiology of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in adults, which are an important cause of morbidity, remains undetermined in more than 50% of cases (Fine et al., 1999, Garbino et al., 2002, File, 2003), mostly due to limited diagnostic procedures. The prevalence of respiratory viruses in adults is largely unexplored, as most relevant data concern infants and children (Choi et al., 2006, Costa et al., 2006, Kusel et al., 2006, Ma et al., 2006, Ordas et al., 2006, Pierangeli et al., 2007). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenzaviruses (PIVs), influenzaviruses (FLUs) and adenoviruses (AdVs) are considered the leading causes of acute viral LRTIs (Henderson et al., 1979, Hall et al., 1990, Yun et al., 1995, Hong et al., 2001). However, many other respiratory viruses have been recently identified as possible causative agents of LRTIs. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs), which previously were believed to cause only mild upper respiratory illnesses, have been found in association with acute and chronic LRTIs, including asthma exacerbations and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), although their role as causative agents has only been established for asthma (Singh and Busse, 2007, Papadopoulos et al., 2002, Friedlander and Busse, 2005, Xatzipsalti et al., 2005). Newly discovered viruses, such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human coronaviruses (hCoVs) have been associated with LRTIs in children (van den Hoogen et al., 2001, Fouchier et al., 2004, van der Hoek et al., 2004, Choi et al., 2006).",

Clinical-epidemiological data were collected through a standardized questionnaire. Patients with suspect Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection were not included in the analysis. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committees, and informed consent signed by participants. The selection criterion for patients\u2019 enrolment was to have any one of the following samples sent to the laboratory for routine microbiological evaluation: sputum (SP), bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs), or endotracheal aspirate (EA). To minimize the possibility that positive results reflected contamination from the upper respiratory tract, only samples containing more than 25 polymorphonuclear leucocytes per field (40\u00d7) were processed (Murray and Washington, 1975, Geckler et al., 1977). Less than 4% of the samples did not meet this criterion and were discarded. Half of each sample was submitted to standard microbiological analysis (common microbiological culture and, in case of positive result, identification and antibody susceptibility test), while the remainder was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for the molecular analysis. During April 2004\u2013May 2005, a total of 510 consecutive lower tract respiratory samples (329 SP, 165 EA and 16 BAL), which were considered appropriate on the basis of microscope inspection, were analyzed.",

We applied a large molecular diagnostic panel which included 12 respiratory viruses to evaluate the prevalence of respiratory pathogens in adults hospitalized in Italy, during April 2004\u2013May 2005. Although we would be unable to detect some viral respiratory pathogens, such as bocavirus, coronavirus HKU1 and parainfluenzavirus 4, this is the first extensive investigation of lower respiratory tract secretions from adults that was capable of detecting such a wide selection of respiratory pathogens. We have made the assumption that the samples represent the lower respiratory tract, as a recognized microscope inspection criterion was used to validate their quality. However, as expectorated sputum is necessarily contaminated with oral contents, it is not possible to rule out that the virus detected in the samples (mainly SP) could actually derive from contamination by upper respiratory tract secretions. In fact, the rate of positivity in SP is higher than in EA and BAL (47.4% vs. 35.1% and 37.5%, respectively); however, this is not the case for all viruses (i.e. FLU-A). In addition, the presence of several viruses (FLU-A, PIV-3, HRV, hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-NL63) on both EA and BAL, suggests that contamination with oral secretions is not a major source of the virus present in the analyzed samples.",
