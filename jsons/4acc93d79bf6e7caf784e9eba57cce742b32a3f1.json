The hydropathy of the hexon proteins from human adenovirus types 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 12, 16, 40, 41, and 48, bovine adenovirus type 3, murine adenovirus type 1, and avian adenovirus types 1 and 10 was analysed. The presence of purines and pyrimidines in the second position of the codons was correlated to hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, respectively. Comparison of the hydrophilicity plots of eight hexons showed seven hypervariable regions to be distributed on the surface. A large portion of the hypervariable regions manifests hydrophilicity. The strength of the surface charge accumulated on the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions correlated to the tissue tropism of the different adenovirus types. Analysis of codon usage for adenovirus hexons showed that among synonymous codons those with cytidine in the third position were preferably used to a great extent. Analysis of the nucleotide and amino acid sequence pair distances and the phylogenetic tree of 14 hexon proteins showed members of subgenera B, D and E to be closely related, especially Ad4 and Ad16, and subgenus A to be closely related to subgenus F.",

The top contains three long loops L1, L2 and L4 [3] . However, the hydropathic character of the adenovirus hexons and the codon usage has not been analysed. The hydropathy of a protein is very important for predicting putative antigenic regions of the protein. The antigenic determinants can be deduced by searching the amino acid sequence for the areas of greatest local hydrophilicity.

Having analysed nine adenovirus hexon genes, we found the presence of purine and pyrimidine at the second codon position to be correlated to hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, respectively [19] . This \u00aending was recently con\u00aermed by analysis of further data obtained from GenBank. Here, we report the hydropathy analysis of 14 adenovirus hexon sequences predicted from a newly determined Ad7 hexon DNA sequence and thirteen published hexon sequences of Ad2, Ad3, Ad4, Ad5, Ad12, Ad16, Ad40, Ad41, Ad48, Bav3, Mav1, Fav1 and Fav10. There is strong correlation between hydrophilicity and the codons with purine in the second position (CPUSs), and between hydrophobicity and the codons with pyrimidine in the second position (CPYSs) in adenovirus hexons. Comparison of the surface charge on these 14 hexons suggests the strength of the surface charge accumulated in hydrophilic regions or hydrophobic regions to be correlated with the tissue tropism of the different adenovirus types.",

Analysis of the data obtained from GenBank [33] The C G content of different organisms is used as one of the criteria in taxonomy. Among various eubacteria the C G content of the genome DNA ranges from 25% to 75% [20] . In Adenoviridae the DNA C G content varies from 48\u00b161% for mastadenoviruses and 54\u00b155% for aviadenoviruses [24] . In the six different subgenera of human adenoviruses the C G content of genome DNA ranges from 48% to 58% [35] . The C G content of all 14 serotypes reveals the existence of two groups: higher C G content (54.59\u00b158.23%) group including Ad48, Ad4, Bav3, Fav1 and Fav10, and lower C G content (47.48\u00b150.78%) group including the remaining nine serotypes ( Table 2 ). The C G content of human adenovirus hexons was consistent with the level of C G content of whole adenovirus genome DNA with the exception of subgenus C, Ad2 and Ad5, which has higher C G content (58%) in genome DNA.",
