In this case, acute PH is due to reflex and reversible hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. The second cause of acute PH in ICU patient is acute left ventricle failure that increases left atrial pressure and, as a consequence, pulmonary artery pressure (''post capillary'' PH). Acute PH is a reversible phenomenon when hypoxia and/or left atrial pressure are rapidly controlled. This should be differentiated from chronic PH that can be due to various chronic diseases. In ICU patients, chronic PH is also frequently seen in the evolution of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), thromboembolic disease or chronic left heart failure. Beyond these three mains causes of chronic PH, the intensivist have to keep in mind that PH can be associated to rare chronic diseases that should not be under diagnosed because they imply a specific treatment. The more frequent of these rare diseases is PAH. The accurate diagnosis of PAH is of crucial importance since it implies a specific treatment by selective pulmonary vasodilators.",

This pragmatic approach is apparently well adapted to critically ill patients but it nowadays appears as too simple. As evoked in introduction section, in ICU patients, ''secondary'' chronic PH is frequently observed as a final consequence of chronic diseases as left ventricle failure (post capillary chronic PH), chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In 1973, primary PH referred to PH with no obvious cardiovascular or pulmonary cause. It was further demonstrated that ''primary'' PH was a complex and non-homogeneous group of diseases that could be primary (idiopathic), but also associated with various diseases ranging from connective tissue disease or cirrhosis to drug toxicity or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Therefore, the risk of the original classification was to under-diagnose rare causes of PH that needs a specific treatment. Then, a more complex classification was proposed in 1998 (Evian classification [7] ) and updated in 2003 (Venice classification [8] ) and 2008 (Dana point classification, published in 2009 [5] ). The actual classification (Dana point) is shown in Table 1 . The three main evolutions of the new classification were (1) to stop the use of primary/secondary HP classification, (2) to separate PH from pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), (3) to separate PAH from veno-occlusive pulmonary disease and/or hemagiomatosis [4, 5, 9] . The evolution of clinical classification of PH during the 3 past decades is summarized in Table 1 . Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH = Class 1) refers to a heterogeneous group of non-cardiac, non-pulmonary diseases characterized by a chronic PH. The main causes of PAH are: idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, associated (HIV infection, connective tissue disease, portal hypertension, congenital heart disease, schistosomiasis, chronic hemolytic anemia) and persistent PH of the newborn. In this classification, pulmonary hypertension refers to a PH due to an obvious pulmonary or cardiac cause. The three mains causes of PH are cardiac (severe congestive left heart failure, Class 2), pulmonary (COPD, Class 3) and thromboembolic (Class 4) ( Table 1) . A fourth cause of PH is proliferative diseases as hematologic diseases, storage diseases or anatomical obstruction of pulmonary vessels by fibrosis or tumor (Class 5). These four PH classes represent the ''secondary'' PH of the original classification. Finally, an intermediate class (Class 1 0 ) is a direct pulmonary vessels disease called pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and/or capillary hemangiomatosis. The diagnosis of PVOD may be difficult because since it can mimics left ventricle failure. ",

            "text": "Pulmonary artery hypertension is characterized by a progressive increase of pulmonary artery resistances and chronic right ventricle failure. Chronic right heart failure is the main prognostic factor of PAH. The prevalence is probably underestimated because of the poor specificity of clinical signs. In a population of patients evaluated by echocardiography for dyspnea, the prevalence of PH was about 10 %. On the population of patients with PH echocardiographic signs, about 80 % had left heart failure, 10 % had chronic pulmonary disease and hypoxia, 4 % had PAH, 0.6 % had thromboembolic disease [10] . The prevalence of PAH ranges from 15 to 50/million adult population [11] . Idiopathic PAH (IPAH) is the most common cause of PAH. In a population of patient with documented PAH, 39.2 % of patients has IPAH and 3.9 % had family history of PAH. In the subgroup of associated PAH, 15.3 % had connective tissue disease, 11.3 % had congenital heart disease, 10.4 % had portal hypertension, 9.5 % had anorexigen-associated PAH and 6.2 % had HIV infection [12] . Pulmonary artery hypertension is a severe and insidious disease. The non-specific signs of PAH are associated with a delayed diagnosis that worsens prognosis. Before 2000, there were few specific treatment and few specialized teams for PAH care. At that time, the mean survival time was low (2.8 years following diagnosis) with survival rates of 68, 48, and 34 % at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively [1]. Since the introduction of specific vasodilators (in particular epoprostenol) and specialized teams, the prognosis significantly improved as the reported survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 87.8, 76.3, and 62.8 % in USA registry and 87, 76 and 67 % in the French registry, respectively [1, 13] . If these results are encouraging, the prognosis remains severe, especially when ICU systemic-to-pulmonary shunts due to large defects leading to a severe increase in PVR and resulting in a reversed (pulmonary-to-systemic) or bidirectional shunt. Cyanosis, erythrocytosis, and multiple organ involvement are present b Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with systemic-to-pulmonary shunts. In these patients with moderate to large defects, the increase in PVR is mild to moderate, systemic-topulmonary shunt is still largely present, and no cyanosis is present at rest c Adult pulmonary arterial hypertension with small defects : in cases with small defects (usually ventricular septal defects, 1 cm and atrial septal defects, 2 cm of effective diameter assessed by echocardiography) the clinical picture is very similar to idiopathic PAH d Pulmonary arterial hypertension after corrective cardiac surgery. In these cases, congenital heart disease has been corrected but PAH is either still present immediately after surgery or has recurred several months or years after surgery in the absence of significant post-operative residual congenital lesions or defects that originate as a sequela to previous surgery admission is required. In ICU, the prognostic of PH or PAH is considered as poor but few data are available. Therefore, no strong recommendation for PH or PAH treatment in ICU patients can be done [14, 15] . In a population of 82 septic ICU patients with history of PH mainly due to pulmonary disease, the mortality was related to the severity of PH. In mild, moderate or severe PH, the mortality was 28, 67 and 80 %, respectively [16] . Therefore, in patients with end-stage PH in whom all available treatment options have been exhausted, limitations on advanced treatment and/or ICU admission should be discussed [15] .",

In particular, mutations of bone morphogenetic protein recepetor-2 (BMPR2) or activin-like receptor 1 (ALK-1) were shown to be associated with PAH and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, respectively (Class 1, 2, Table 1 ).

            "text": "Because patients with PAH admitted in ICU are usually at advanced stage of the disease, echocardiography findings are usually easy to diagnose. The first difficulty is to separate acute from chronic PH. In case of acute PH, sPAP value is rarely more than 40 mm Hg. Above such value, RV cannot compensate acute afterload increase and right cardiac output (CO) decreases. The subsequent low CO limits the sPAP increase, which rarely reaches more than 40-45 mm Hg. The consequence of acute RV failure is a rapid (few hours) dilation of RV. As pericardium is not distensible in a short period of time, the biventricular volume is constant. Therefore, the hemodynamic consequence of acute RV dilation is LV compression, which limits LV filling and subsequently worsens low cardiac output. For those reasons, when a sPAP value is more than 40 mm Hg, a chronic PH is likely. In chronic PH, the simplest way to assess sPAP is to record tricuspid regurgitation (TR) flow on a four-chamber apical view ( Table 3 ). The maximal velocity of TR is correlated to the pressure gradient between pulmonary artery and RV (Table 3) . This approach can also be applied to pulmonary regurgitation that require a trained operator. Pulmonary regurgitation flow allows evaluation of mean and diastolic pulmonary artery pressure ( Table 3 ). The sum of right atrial pressure or central venous pressure (RAP, CVP) value and right ventriculo-arterial gradient represent sPAP ( Table 3) . Evaluation of RAP value by TTE is summarized in Table 4 . A semiquantitative approach of sPAP can be done on the basis of gradient only ( Table 3 ). The acceleration time of pulmonary ejection flow allows a semiquantitative assessment of sPAP for trained operators when TR is not recordable. (Table 3 )",

Contrast CT angiography of the pulmonary artery show the typical angiographic findings in chronic thromboembolic PH (Class 4) such as complete obstruction, bands and webs, and intimal irregularities as accurately and reliably as conventional angiography. High-resolution CT scan gives important informations on lung parenchyma. It can easily identify interstitial lung disease, advanced COPD and emphysema. It can also be helpful in case of clinical suspicion of PVOD. The presence of interstitial edema with diffuse central ground-glass opacification and thickening of interlobular septa suggest PVOD. In this disease, CT scan may also show lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion. A diffuse bilateral thickening of interlobular septa associated with small centrilobular poorly circumscribed nodular opacities can help to diagnose pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis.",

It is the sole way to test the vasoreactivity of pulmonary vessels to selective pulmonary vasodilators in order to evaluate the usefulness of subsequent chronic treatment. In outpatients, the complication rate of RHC is low in experienced centers [23] . In a study evaluating 7218 RHC procedures, the complication rate was 1.1 % (IC 0.8-1.3), related to difficult vascular access, arrhythmias or hypotension. Four death were reported but only one was directly attributable to RHC. RHC must record staged measurement of SaO2, RAP, RV pressure, PAP (systolic, diastolic and mean), PA wedge pressure (that reflects left atrial pressure), cardiac output, cardiac index and pulmonary vascular resistances. The RHC criteria for PAH are summarized in Table 6 . At the time of diagnosis, mPAP value is 50 \u00b1 17 mm Hg NYHA class I-II patients and 56 \u00b1 15 mm Hg NYHA III-IV class patients [12] . The RHC can be useful for the diagnosis of PVOD. When the catheter extremity is in wedge position, a saline flush leads to a marked pressure increase followed by a very slow pressure decrease. This phenomenon is due to a trapping of saline between the catheter and the occluded veins. If a wedge pressure can be recorded (this may be difficult), a low value is classical whereas capillary pressure is high. This can be indirectly assessed by the difference between dPAP and PAwP.",

It can use IV epoprostenol IV at a dose ranging from 2 to 10 ng/Kg/min (incremental dose of 2 ng/Kg/min every 15 min), or IV adenosine at a dose ranging from 50 to 250 mcg/Kg/min (incremental dose of 50 mcg/Kg/min every 2 min), or inhaled nitric oxide (NO) at a dose ranging from 10 to 80 ppm (fixed dose, no incremental administration needed). Inhaled NO is the best pharmacological agent because of a strong selectivity for pulmonary vessels. In clinical practice, inhaled NO is administered at a dose of 24 to 40 ppm over 5 min. At that time, new RHC measurements are performed, with ongoing NO administration.

In ICU patients, PAH remains a severe disease with a high mortality rate. When PAH is suspected, a systematic diagnosis approach is of particular importance in order to rapidly eliminate left cardiac, thromboembolic and pulmonary causes of PH. Left cardiac disease is the most common cause of PH. Early recognition of PAH allows a rapid introduction of selective pulmonary vasodilators that can improve outcome. Idiopathic PAH is the most frequent cause but it can also be associated with scleroderma, HIV infection, anorexigen toxicity, thyroid disease, cirrhosis. Pulmonary vasodilators should be only a part of a general management including treatment of triggering factors, optimization of fluid balance, decrease of RV afterload by using pulmonary vasodilators while maintaining cardiac output and mean arterial pressure. The early contact of PH referral center or specialized physician is of particular importance.",
