In contrast to Theophrastus, who was a pure botanist, Dioscorides was a pharmacognosist. Everything he wrote about plants was dominated by an examination of their therapeutic effects.

The list of properties that Plinius attributed to liquorice is highly significant. For example, he suggested liquorice as a remedy for asthma, malaises of the throat, ulcerations of the mouth, and even advised its use to combat sterility. This last effect has been confirmed by the most recent observations regarding the estrogenic effects of certain compounds present in the drug (Armanini et al., 2002).",

In the century that followed, the Neapolitan doctor, chemist and philosopher Giuseppe Donzelli described liquorice, referring to it here by its modern name, explaining its etymology as \u201csweet root\u201d and citing several areas of Germany where it was cultivated (Donzelli, 1737). The Swedish naturalist Carl von Linn\u00e9 (1707\u20131778) proceeded to subdivide plants into genus and species, adopting a nomenclature with two names. Within the genus Glycyrrhiza that he coined, he identified three different species: Glycyrrhiza glabra, Glycyrrhiza echinata and Glycyrrhiza hirsuta (Linn\u00e9, 1764, Linn\u00e9, 1774).",

In addition to this, an area of application not found in Europe is intoxication by drugs and poisoned food (Leung, 1993).

The effects first reported by Dioscorides and Al Razi referring to beneficial effects on excessive tissue growth around nails, in the eye and in form of tumours have been confirmed in vitro by demonstrating that liquorice causes apoptosis. This is evident from its antineoplastic effect against melanoma and gastric cancer cells (Ma et al., 2000, Wang and Nixon, 2001, Kobayashi et al., 2002). Besides the antiproliferative effects shown with liquorice, new useful applications have recently been described in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (Saeedi et al., 2003), suggesting a potential role for the drug in allergic/inflammatory diseases of the skin. In addition, liquorice has been reported to be useful for inflammatory lesions induced by ultraviolet radiation (Fujita et al., 1980, Halder and Richards, 2004).",

The above-mentioned activities against viruses serve as a clear demonstration of this.
