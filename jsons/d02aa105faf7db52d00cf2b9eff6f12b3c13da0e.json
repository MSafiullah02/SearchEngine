Published estimates of Years Lived with Disability (YLD) from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study help to characterise the extent of these effects.

Evidence has emerged to show that elderly people and those with pre-existing multi-morbid conditions may be at higher risk of developing severe health consequences from COVID-19 [4] . In Europe, 31% of the population are estimated to have a condition that is on the Government of the United Kingdom's (UK) list of conditions at increased risk of severe health consequences from COVID-19 disease [5] . There is currently a disparity of comparable information across countries to objectively assess country-level vulnerability to COVID-19. However, there is a wealth of data on population structure, health status and causes of health loss in countries, which can be obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study [6] . These data can be used to approximate how vulnerable populations are, particularly by focusing on the population share of elderly residents and the YLD for health conditions that have been identified as potentially linked to severe illness from COVID-19. This is of particular relevance for European countries, as increases in lifespan have resulted in increasingly ageing populations living with effects of non-communicable diseases, multi-morbidity and frailty [7] .",

Neither do they take into account factors such as: population density, the capacity or ease of access to health and social care services and the disruption to existing services due to the COVID-19 crisis, all of which will have a significant impact on the extent to which vulnerable populations are adequately protected from harm. This may partly explain why countries identified in this analysis with high and low vulnerability to severe health consequences from COVID-19 do not always correspond with those countries in Europe with the highest and lowest case fatality ratios due to COVID-19 [14] . For example, within the Baltic states Latvia and Estonia have high vulnerability as measured on both indicators. However, Latvia responded to the crisis quickly by closing their borders and implementing restrictive measures much faster than Estonia, and case fatality rates are higher in Estonia [14] [15] [16] . This example highlights that a number of additional factors could contribute to differences between vulnerability and extent of adverse consequences, including: care identification and under-reporting, the speed at which countries introduced restrictive measures, and restrictions on air travel. The use of summary health indicator such as YLD to identify severe health consequences from COVID-19 infections should be regarded as just one of the elements that need to be taken into account in a complete risk assessment of vulnerability.",

The use of GBD 2017 is advantageous as estimates are publically accessible, which allows for the rapid assessments of the impact in response to public health emergency scenarios, such as the COVID-19 outbreak. Our findings are comparable on a like-for-like basis across countries. However, data sources that are fed into the modelling process for country-level estimates can vary based on location, therefore there is a risk that some of the differences which we observe may be attributed to the use, or omission, of high quality data sources [17] . We have opted not to include estimates of uncertainty in our estimates. Uncertainty intervals in the GBD study can often be wide, representing large degrees of uncertainty, so users of these results must bear in mind that these findings relate to the best available point-estimate. To retain consistency with estimates of YLD from GBD 2017, data on population size and structure was obtained from GHDx [13] which may differ from nationally produced estimates.",

Previous research has suggested that the assumption of fixed severity distributions across countries may be unreasonable [18] . In our study of COVID-19 related vulnerable conditions, we did not include some of the leading causes of YLD, such as major depressive disorders and substance use disorders, which are thought to be the most likely to be affected by this assumption. Thus, our COVID-19 vulnerable conditions analysis may be less affected by this assumption [19] . Additionally, our study has assumed that the extent of vulnerability to COVID-19 can be determined by disability weights. For example, on average a greater weight would be given to those suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than to ischaemic heart disease [20] . This assumption may be problematic if the risk of COVID-19 associated with each health condition is not representative of relative differences in disability weight between causes. Also, particular combinations of disease may result in higher risks of consequences of COVID-19, while all combinations are in this approach assumed to have a similar effect.",

We have chosen to explore the aim of the YLD summary measure to combine all conditions, rather than examine the impact of individual causes. We acknowledge that using disease prevalence data from GHDx could add further insight into quantifying the disease specific implications of severe health consequences from COVID-19. However, since prevalence gives equal weighting to each condition, we did not consider prevalence as useful for summary analyses as YLD which allows a weighted sum of prevalence of different diseases. Further analysis has previously been carried out elsewhere to explore using prevalence to quantify the risk for severe health consequences from COVID-19 infection to enhance assessment of a health systems vulnerability to COVID-19 [5] .",

Accessed 10 Apr 2020.We are advising those who are at increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19) to be particularly stringent in following social distancing measures.This group includes those who are:\uf0b7 aged 70 and above (regardless of medical conditions) \uf0b7 under 70 with an underlying health condition listed below (i.e. anyone instructed to get a flu jab as an adult each year on medical grounds): \uf0b7 chronic (long-term) respiratory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema or bronchitis \uf0b7 chronic heart disease, such as heart failure \uf0b7 chronic kidney disease \uf0b7 chronic liver disease, such as hepatitis \uf0b7 chronic neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, motor neurone disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), a learning disability or cerebral palsy \uf0b7 diabetes \uf0b7 problems with your spleenfor example, sickle cell disease or if you have had your spleen removed \uf0b7 a weakened immune system as the result of conditions such as HIV and AIDS, or medicines such as steroid tablets or chemotherapy \uf0b7 being seriously overweight (a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or above) \uf0b7 those who are pregnant Note: there are some clinical conditions which put people at even higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. If you are in this category, next week the NHS in England will directly contact you with advice about the more stringent measures you should take in order to keep yourself and others safe. For now, you should rigorously follow the social distancing advice in full, outlined below.People falling into this group are those who may be at particular risk due to complex health problems such as:\uf0b7 people who have received an organ transplant and remain on ongoing immunosuppression medication \uf0b7 people with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radiotherapy \uf0b7 people with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia who are at any stage of treatment \uf0b7 people with severe chest conditions such as cystic fibrosis or severe asthma (requiring hospital admissions or courses of steroid tablets) \uf0b7 people with severe diseases of body systems, such as severe kidney disease (dialysis)",
