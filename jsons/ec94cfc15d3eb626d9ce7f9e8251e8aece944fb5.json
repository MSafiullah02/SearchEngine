As shown in figure 1A, the size of the GST-ORF8a RP was \u223c30 kDa, which is very close to our estimation, given that the predicted sizes of GST and ORF8a were 26 and 4.4 kDa, respectively. Subsequently, we used WB with GST-ORF8a RP to detect anti-ORF8a antibody reactivity in 37 patients with SARS, and we found that 2 of them were seropositive ( figure 1B) . The anti-ORF8a antibody reactivity was further confirmed by IFA with cells expressing HA-tagged ORF8a ( figure 1C , e and f ). To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating anti-ORF8a antibody reactivity in patients with SARS. It has been reported that the region immediately upstream of orf8a gene contains a consensus transcription regulating sequence (TRS) [22, 23] . A 2-kb subgenomic RNA has been identified in a Northern-blot analysis as potentially responsible for ORF8a translation [24] . Therefore, orf8a encodes a protein that can induce antibody reactivity in some patients infected with SARS-CoV. In general, viral structural proteins have higher immunogenicity than regulatory proteins [25, 26] . In addition, antibodies to virus regulatory proteins may be detectable at particular disease stages [27, 28] . According to clinical histories, none of the 7 patients in our study who died of SARS had anti-ORF8a antibody. Both patients with anti-ORF8a antibody (C596 and HP631) recovered from SARS-CoV infection, and neither of them developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Recently, we evaluated, using a WB assay, anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid antibody reactivity among 108 medical staffpersons who had acquired SARS coronavirus infection in 2003, and we found 8 persons had reactivity to both antibodies. Among them, 1 person who had ARDS did not have anti-ORF8a antibody, whereas 2 of 7 individuals who did not have ARDS had anti-ORF8a antibody reactivity. It seems that patients with anti-ORF8a antibody reactivity had less-severe symptoms and a better prognosis. More research is needed to determine the association between the presence of anti-ORF8a antibody and the prognosis of SARS-CoV infection.",

Furthermore, compared with the siRNA-GFP control, siRNA-orf8a inhibited 150% of the replication of SARS-CoV (figure 3B). Previous studies have shown that both cellular and viral proteins can enhance the transcription of CoV via interaction with its leader RNA and TRS [29] [30] [31] . We performed a UV cross-linking assay to examine whether ORF8a has RNA-binding activity. Preliminary results showed that neither positive-strand nor negativestrand leader RNA of SARS-CoV interacted with GST-ORF8a fusion protein directly. It cannot be ruled out that the ORF8a protein interacts with leader RNA indirectly through other cellular proteins or that orf8a RNA other than the ORF8a protein is the basis of these effects. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism of transactivation of ORF8a.",

This motif exists in many viral proteins that target mitochondria, including the BamHI fragment H rightward ORF1 in Epstein-Barr virus, F1L in vaccinia virus, and vBcl-2 in human herpesvirus type 8 [33] [34] [35] . According to the results of our sequence analysis, there is a hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain at the N-terminal region of ORF8a. This membrane-spanning domain is 19 aa in length and is surrounded by positively charged amino acids (table 1) .
