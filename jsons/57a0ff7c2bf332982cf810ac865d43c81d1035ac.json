During nasopharyngeal swab sampling, the medical staff has to be in close contact with the patient. The patient may cough, vomit, and breathe hard to produce a large number of droplets or aerosols, increasing the risk of cross-infection. In addition, the quality of nasopharyngeal swab collection is different due to the irregular operation and psychological fear of the collectors, which leads to false negative or false positive, which affects the judgment of the patient's condition.",

Early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and quarantine and isolation strategies of patients with COVID-19 can significantly prevent and control the transmission of the virus. By appropriately identifying the infected individuals and minimizing the transmission of the virus in the community, it is possible to effectively control the spread of infection. The early clinical symptoms of COVID-19 lack specificity, and its etiology is difficult to identify through computed tomography scans. Therefore, the handbook guide [1] suggests that the gold standard of diagnosing COVID-19 is real-time fluorescence-based real-time isolation rooms and install air purification systems. Therefore, our hospital designed and set up a special room under negative pressure for nasopharyngeal swab sampling, with an air change rate of 12 times per hour. To prevent close contact between suspected cases and the sampling collector, a transparent acrylic board with two openings for sampling was set up to separate the two areas for them ( Figure 1 ). The room was installed with air disinfectors and ultraviolet air purifiers.",

A video and a series of pictures showed the process of nasopharyngeal swab sampling and provided guide for suspected cases about how to properly cooperate during sampling. All the collected specimens should be placed in a double-layered bag with a clear bio-safety marking without delay, stored at 4\u2103 [6] and submitted to the laboratory within 2 hours. Medical waste produced during the collection process should be sealed in a double-layered yellow bag with a \"special infection\" label and delivered to the special medical waste temporary storage room.",

From January 7, 2020 to February 16, 2020, over 11,000 nasopharyngeal swab samples were successfully collected at our hospital. Eight nurses operated over 1,375 times on average without any collector being infected. Through the establishment of the sampling room, 8 strict disinfection of the sampling environment, training of professional nurses, enhancement of personal protection, standardization of collection methods and processes, and timely and safe specimen transport, the goal of safety management was achieved. This is important and significant in ensuring the safety of healthcare professionals and improving the efficiency of nucleic acid amplification test for diagnosis of corona virus disease 2019.",

During the process, droplets and aerosol produced by sneezing, coughing, and talking of patients and close contact between healthcare professionals and COVID-19-infected patients can directly cause respiratory tract infections[2][3] in healthcare professionals.

This can lead to small environmental contamination around the patient and is an important resource of nosocomial infection[4], largely increasing the risk of patient cross-infection and transmission to healthcare professionals.
