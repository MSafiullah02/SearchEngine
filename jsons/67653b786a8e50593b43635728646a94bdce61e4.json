Early on, laboratory 45 testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. was performed only at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 46 (CDC) laboratories in Atlanta, GA using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay 47 that was developed there (11). Subsequently, the CDC test was to be implemented in all state public 48 health laboratories, but roll out was slow due to technical problems. Following the declaration of a 49 public health emergency, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) moved to allow in vitro diagnostic 50 assays under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in an attempt to expedite test development by 51 commercial and clinical laboratories. The majority of assays approved through EUA are nucleic acid 52 amplification tests that target conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Abbott Molecular received 53 authorization for the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay to be performed on the m2000 real-time platform on 54 March 18, 2020 (12) . The ID NOW\u2122 COVID-19 assay was granted approval under the EUA on March 27, 55 2020. In vitro diagnostic device (IVD) assays with EUA status from commercial manufacturers do not 56 undergo usual FDA review under the De Novo request or the 510(k) premarket notification; as such, 57 limited data comparing these assays are available. 58 .

To analyze the performance of 184 the ID NOW\u2122 COVID-19 assay further, we tested its performance using dry nasal swab samples and 185 compared results to those from paired nasopharyngeal samples tested by the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 186 assay. Ninety-seven patients were included in this evaluation. Mean age of patients was 59 \u00b117 years, 187 and 48 (48%) were women. Thirteen (13.4%) paired nasopharyngeal samples yielded positive results by 188 the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay. C n values of these samples ranged from 9.2-29.2.
