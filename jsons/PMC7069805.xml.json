            "text": "The majority of current vaccines are thought to prevent disease through the induction of a protective antibody response1,2. For elicitation of protective humoral immunity by vaccination, B cells must be activated, enter germinal centers to undergo affinity maturation of their antigen receptors and then differentiate into either long-lived plasma cells that secrete antibody constitutively or memory B cells that participate in a recall response on re-exposure to the pathogen. Adjuvants help drive these immunological mechanisms, shaping vaccine protection3,4. The most prevalent adjuvant in licensed human vaccines is also one of the oldest known adjuvants, aluminum hydroxide (alum). The function of alum is complex and potentially dependent on induction of inflammatory cell death at the injection site, activation of innate immune-sensing pathways and production of chemokines and cytokines at the injection site and/or draining lymph nodes (LNs)5\u20137. Although effective in many vaccines, immune responses elicited by alum are often weaker than other adjuvants in clinical and preclinical studies8\u201310. Despite these limitations, the rigorous requirements for safety in vaccines make the successful development of new adjuvants a major challenge and alum remains an important gold standard benchmark for all adjuvants7.",

            "text": "Here we aimed to understand immunological mechanisms of action of this classic adjuvant by evaluating whether the function of alum could be enhanced by engineering the interaction between antigens and alum. Although alum is most commonly employed by adsorbing antigens to alum particles for administration, it is known that many antigens rapidly desorb from alum in the presence of serum or interstitial fluid11\u201315. Additionally, the rate of antigen clearance in vivo is often unaffected by preadsorption to alum16,17. We thus designed immunogens for tight binding to alum through site-specific introduction of multivalent phosphoserine (pSer) peptide\u2013polymer affinity tags, which undergo a ligand exchange reaction with the surface of alum to anchor immunogens in an oriented manner on alum particles. We then studied how this modification altered both the fate of these immunogens in vivo and the resulting immune responses.",

Peptides consisting of 1\u201312 consecutive pSer followed by a short poly(ethylene glycol) spacer and N-terminal maleimide functional group were prepared by solid-phase synthesis (Fig. 1a). We first coupled linkers with one, two or four pSer groups to yeast cytochrome c, which has a free solvent-exposed cysteine. The pSer-modified cytochrome c exhibited steadily increasing binding to alum as the number of serine residues in the tag increased (Extended Data Fig. 1a). To evaluate the role of pSer valency in achieving stable binding to alum, we modified the 240 kDa fluorescent protein phycoerythrin (PE) with 2\u201320 linkers, where each linker contained either one or four pSer residues (Extended Data Fig. 1b). The pSer1- or pSer4-modified PE was adsorbed to alum, followed by incubation in buffer containing 10% serum, and protein bound to alum after this two-step process was measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 1c, unmodified PE showed almost no retention on alum, but pSer tags promoted a majority of the protein to adhere to alum for >24 h. Only 2\u20134 pSer4 linkers per protein were required to achieve the same level of binding as 10\u201320 linkers that had a single pSer residue. Thus, even for very large proteins, modification with a few multivalent pSer tags promotes stable binding to alum in the presence of serum.",

In buffer, 90% of added eOD adsorbed to alum within 30 min, irrespective of peptide tag composition (Extended Data Fig. 1e). However, when alum-adsorbed eOD was incubated in 10% serum, only ~2% of unmodified eOD or serine-modified eOD remained bound, whereas pSer-modified antigen showed increasing retention on alum with increasing pSer valency, plateauing at ~75% retention for four or more phosphoserines (Fig. 1b). Thus, immunogen binding to alum could be readily tuned through the introduction of pSer affinity tags containing discrete numbers of pSer moieties.",

To determine how pSer-mediated antigen binding to alum influences in vivo antigen availability, BALB/c mice were injected with AlexaFluor647 (AF647)-conjugated eOD or pSer4-eOD mixed with alum and fluorescence at the injection site was tracked by whole-animal fluorescence imaging. Unmodified eOD cleared from the injection site within 3 d, whereas pSer4-eOD persisted for over 3 weeks (Fig. 1c,d). As an additional control, we injected pSer4-eOD mixed with aluminum phosphate, an alternative clinical formulation of alum that has many fewer sites for ligand exchange with the pSer tag. In this case, pSer4-eOD cleared at the same rate as eOD (Fig. 1c,d). When varying pSer linker valency, we observed maximum antigen persistence with four or more pSer residues (Fig. 1e). Histology of the injection sites 8 d after injection showed pSer8-eOD colocalized with alum, whereas unmodified eOD was undetectable (Fig. 1f,g). These results demonstrate that pSer antigens are cleared in vivo substantially more slowly than unmodified antigens adsorbed to alum.",

Immunization of BALB/c mice with Ser4-eOD:alum or pSer-eOD:alum revealed a clear trend of increasing serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G titers as the number of phosphoserines in the affinity tag increased; pSer8-eOD elicited 48-fold higher serum IgG titers compared to the Ser4-eOD antigen, which persisted over 6 weeks (Fig. 2a,b). The pSer-antigen:alum immunization was effective whether vaccines were administered via a subcutaneous (s.c.) or intramuscular (i.m.) route (Fig. 2c) and we did not detect a measurable antibody response to the pSer linker itself (Extended Data Fig. 1f). Further, ELISPOT analysis of bone marrow plasma cells 3 months after a single pSer-antigen:alum immunization showed 16-fold more antigen-specific plasma cells elicited by immunization with pSer4-eOD or pSer8-eOD compared to control Ser4-eOD (Fig. 2d). Immunization with pSer-modified eOD increased total germinal center (GC) B cells compared to Ser-modified eOD by 1.5-fold (Fig. 2e,f and Extended Data Fig. 1g). Strikingly, the percentage of eOD-binding GC B cells increased dramatically from 2.8% to 33% in response to pSer-antigen immunization (Fig. 2g,h and Extended Data Fig. 1h). Overall, these results indicate that pSer-immunogen:alum immunization promotes both qualitative and quantitative improvements in humoral immune responses.",

In the setting of tight binding between the immunogen and alum particles, we envisioned that antigen delivery to LNs over time could either be mediated by slow release of free antigen from alum surfaces at the site of injection or antigen could be trafficked to LNs still bound to alum nanocrystals (Extended Data Fig. 2a). To assess the potential impact of B cells encountering antigen bound to alum particles, we measured activation of human Ramos B cells, expressing the eOD-specific germline-inferred VRC01 antigen receptor20 cultured in vitro with pSer-eOD:alum conjugates versus eOD:alum. Free monomeric eOD elicited a near-baseline calcium signaling response as reported previously20, as did Ser4-eOD mixed with alum (Extended Data Fig. 2b). By contrast, B cells stimulated by pSer-eOD:alum showed increased activation with increasing pSer valency (Extended Data Fig. 2b). B cells incubated with alum and Ser4-eOD bound alum particles but showed little or no eOD uptake, whereas B cells incubated with pSer8-eOD:alum internalized alum particles together with eOD (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). Higher resolution visualization of these cells by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging revealed that nanoscale alum aggregates were internalized by B cells when pSer8-eOD was bound to alum (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). These results suggest that when bound to alum via pSer linkages, antigens can behave as a multivalent, particulate vaccine that is internalized by B cells.",

To test this possibility, we employed an adoptive transfer model enabling tracking of antigen-specific B cells24. Mouse B cells expressing glVRC01 B cell receptors (BCRs) (VRC01gHL) were transferred into wild-type mice24, followed by vaccination with alum and pSer8- or Ser4-modified monomeric eOD-GT5, a variant of the eOD immunogen, with a physiological affinity (Kd of ~0.3 \u00b5M) for the VRC01gHL BCR19,20,24,25 (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 5a). VRC01gHL B cells in the pSer8-eOD-GT5:alum group acquired antigen 1 d after immunization that continued to accumulate at day 2, whereas Ser4-eOD-GT5:alum immunization led to nearly undetectable antigen uptake by the eOD-specific B cells (Fig. 3b,c). Histology of spleens showed colocalization of alum and pSer8-eOD-GT5 around B cell follicles, whereas in the control group only alum and little to no Ser4-eOD-GT5 was observed (Fig. 3d,e). VRC01gHL B cells showed simultaneous uptake of the pSer-eOD-GT5 and alum, contrasting with undetectable levels of either eOD-GT5 or alum uptake in Ser4-eOD-GT5:alum-immunized mice (Fig. 3f\u2013h). When high-affinity eOD-GT8 was used as the immunogen, pSer modification similarly enhanced antigen (Ag) and alum capture by VRC01gHL cells (Extended Data Fig. 5b\u2013f). TEM imaging of flow-sorted antigen+ B cells collected from mice immunized with alum:pSer8-eOD-GT5 or pSer8-eOD-GT8 showed that VRC01gHL B cells acquiring antigen in vivo had readily detectable accumulations of alum aggregates in endosomal compartments (33% of 153 cell sections counted), whereas endogenous B cells showed no alum uptake (0 of 145 cell sections counted, Fig. 3i\u2013k and Extended Data Fig. 6a\u2013e). Overall, these results demonstrate that by engineering tight binding to alum, pSer-modified antigens are delivered in alum-bound form to B cells in lymphoid tissue in vivo.",

AF647+ (Ag+alum+) VRC01gHL B cells and AF647\u2013 (Ag\u2013alum\u2013) VRC01gHL B cells were analyzed independently. At 48 h, VRC01gHL B cells from eOD-GT5:alum immunized mice exhibited almost identical gene expression profiles to naive VRC01gHL B cells (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). In contrast, over 2,000 genes in Ag+alum+VRC01gHL B cells were differentially expressed in pSer8-eOD-GT5:alum-immunized mice (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7a,b), indicative of strong activation.

As a control for an immunization that induces activation only through the BCR, we immunized mice with a titrated dose of eOD-GT5\u201360mer protein nanoparticles alone24 (Fig. 4a). Interestingly, comparative gene signature analysis revealed selective expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen-processing and presentation genes in Ag+alum+ B cells from pSer8-eOD-GT5:alum immunized mice (false discovery rate q = 0.006, Fig. 4e). Single-cell RNA-seq of VRC01gHL cells was next utilized for more refined assessment of gene expression. Differentially expressed gene clusters defining VRC01gHL B cells from each immunization condition were identified (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 7c). The transcription factor Klf2 was highly differentially expressed in Ag+alum+ B cells and Klf2 is a known regulator of key genes involved in lymphocyte migration, such as Sell, Ccr7 and S1pr1. Cd83 expression was also highly increased in Ag+alum+ B cells (Fig. 4f,g and Extended Data Fig. 7d). CD83 marks mature antigen-presenting cells and facilitates MHC class II surface expression26. CD83 protein was robustly upregulated on Ag+Alum+VRC01gHL B cells from pSer-eOD:alum-immunized mice (Fig. 4h,i and Extended Data Fig. 7e,f), and commensurate increases in MHC class II surface expression were observed (Fig. 4i,j and Extended Data Fig. 7e,f). The major co-stimulatory molecule CD86 was also upregulated (Extended Data Fig. 7g,h). Thus, pSer-immunogen:alum triggers gene expression important for B cell interactions with follicular helper T cells.",

Over 300 differentially expressed alum-associated genes were identified, suggesting that alum exhibited direct adjuvant activity in B cells after engulfment. Gene signature analysis did not find evidence of toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways (Fig. 4e). B cells do not express inflammasomes, and deficiencies in interleukin (IL)-18 or NLRP3 did not impair IgG responses to pSer-eOD:alum immunization (Extended Data Fig. 7i,j).

By contrast, IgG responses in mice immunized with pSer4-MD39:alum were stronger and only partially reduced by addition of the base-specific mAb (Fig. 6f,g). Furthermore, pSer4-MD39:alum immunization led to a significant decrease in responses to the His-tags located at the base of the Env trimer (added for protein purification purposes) when animals were immunized with pSer4-MD39 and increased responses to the gp120 portion of the Env trimer (Fig. 6h and Extended Data Fig. 9l).

The pSer8-MD39:alum immunization resulted in higher binding IgG titers to both the whole trimer and to gp120, when compared to an unmodified MD39:alum control, particularly after prime (Fig. 6i,j). The pSer-trimer:alum immunization also significantly enhanced the induction of autologous tier-2-neutralizing IgG responses, with six of six animals generating tier 2 neutralizing antibody titers at week 10 (2 weeks after boost). In contrast only 3 of 6 rabbits in the MD39:alum control group elicited neutralization at this point and mean neutralizing antibody titers for the responders were 6.5-fold lower (Fig. 6k,l and Extended Data Fig. 9m). To determine whether this enhanced induction of neutralization was linked to alterations in the specificity of the antibody response, we carried out TEM imaging of complexes formed between soluble MD39 Env trimer and purified IgG of the immunized animals at week 10 (ref. 32). This analysis revealed an antibody response dominated by base-binding IgGs in the MD39:alum group, but a more diverse response in the pSer8-MD39:alum group that included putative neutralization epitopes in gp120 and the gp41\u2013gp120 interface (Fig. 6m,n and Extended Data Fig. 10a,b).

This approach was inspired by work of Hem and colleagues, who discovered that phosphorylated proteins were much more tightly bound to alum than antigens relying solely on electrostatic or hydrogen bonding interactions12,13. Following on from these observations, several studies compared humoral responses primed by phosphorylated antigens with different levels of alum-binding affinities and found disparate conclusions, where increasing alum-binding affinity either increased, decreased or had no impact on the magnitude of the IgG response, depending on the antigen and experimental details11,16,33,34. We suspect these conflicting findings may have resulted from the use of antigens randomly modified over the entire protein surface with alum-binding sites, which may allow the immunogen to crosslink alum particles together or become denatured upon binding, either of which could have unpredictable effects on the immune response.",

            "text": "We also demonstrated that site-specific introduction of alum-binding pSer groups enables the epitope specificity of antibody responses to an antigen to be shifted away from immunodominant but nondesired epitopes. While the generality of this strategy remains to be demonstrated for additional antigens beyond the HIV envelope, this approach may be particularly relevant for vaccines targeting viral envelope entry receptors. Soluble forms of these proteins typically expose a large surface at the envelope spike base that harbors non-neutralizing epitopes. In the case of HIV Env, the trimer base is an irrelevant target for protective humoral immunity but has been found in animal models to be highly immunogenic43, raising concerns that immunodominant base-directed antibody responses might interfere with the induction of desired neutralizing antibody lineages29. Oriented antigen display on alum using pSer modification provides one strategy to overcome this issue. Notably, for the HIV gp120 and gp140 trimer immunogens studied here, we routinely achieved yields following peptide coupling and purification of 75\u201385%, with essentially quantitative substitution of the terminal cysteines. There is likely substantial room for further optimization but these outcomes are promising from a translational immunogen manufacturing perspective and we expect this method will be broadly applicable to diverse subunit vaccines in development for infectious disease and beyond.",

Unless otherwise noted, immune responses were measured after a single primary immunization. Sera were collected by retro-orbital bleeding every other week for ELISA measurements. For rabbit immunizations, New Zealand white rabbits were immunized on days 0, 56 and 112 with 100 \u00b5g of MD39 and 1 mg of alum in 1 ml of PBS by s.c. injection (two bilateral injections of 500 \u00b5l each).",

B6.SJL-Ptpcra\nPepcb/BoyJ were maintained at La Jolla Institute for Immunology. B cells were purified using CD43 MACS MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Then, 103 (Fig. 5) or 106 (Figs. 3 and 4) were adoptively transferred in RPMI supplemented with 1% FCS 1\u20133 d before vaccination. For adoptive transfer of 103 VRC01gHL cells, the cells were co-transferred with 5 \u00d7 105 wild-type (B6 or B6.SJL-Ptpcra\nPepcb/BoyJ) splenocytes to facilitate the take in the recipient mice. In some experiments, purified B cells were subsequently labeled with 5 \u00b5M CellTrace Violet (Thermo Fisher) in 0.1% BSA-DPBS for 9.5 min at 37 oC before adoptive transfer.

A CDU chiller was used for sorting and set to 5 \u00b0C to ensure RNA recovery. RNA loss was minimized by on-plate reverse transcription and whole-transcriptome preamplification PCR (23 cycles). PCR preamplified product was purified twice using 0.8\u00d7 AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) to remove any trace of primer\u2013dimers. Samples that failed standard quality control steps, as previously described51, were removed from further downstream steps. Barcoded Illumina sequencing libraries were generated from 0.3\u20130.5 ng of preamplified cDNA using the tn5 DNA insertion method (Nextera XT library preparation kit, Illumina). Libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq2500 Illumina platform to obtain single-end 50-bp reads. The reads were aligned to the mouse mm10 reference genome using TopHat (v.1.4.1)53. Sequencing read coverage per gene was counted using HTSeq-count. Counts per gene were obtained by counting all the transcripts mapping to a gene.",

The number of reads that mapped to each cell was regressed out before scaling and centering data for dimensionality reduction. Principal-component analysis was performed on 791 variable genes and then dimensionality reduction was performed using a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding algorithm employing the top 20 principal components. Differentially expressed genes were identified by performing pairwise comparisons using MAST;55 within the Seurat R package.

(e) eOD proteins (10 \u00b5g/mL) conjugated with a single 4-residue serine linker, or pSer linkers containing 1-8 phosphoserines, were incubated with AlHydrogel (100 \u00b5g/mL) for 30 min in TBS at 25 \u00b0C, followed by measurement of bound protein by fluorescence. (n=3 samples/group). Center lines represent mean and error bars represent SD. (f) Day 63 sera from BALB/c mice (n=5 animals/group) immunized with eOD (black) or pSer4-eOD (red) were tested for binding to pSer tags. Plates were coated with pSer4-cytochrome c to quantify the pSer-specific response. Data represents mean \u00b1 SD. (g, h) Germinal center B cells isolated from the inquinal lymph nodes of BALB/c mice (n= 10 animals/group, pooled from 2 experiments) 9 days after immunization with eOD variants and Al-Hydrogel. Cell counts are provided for GC B cells (g) and eOD-specific GC B cells (h). Center lines represent mean and error bars represent SD. Statistical tests were performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post test.",
