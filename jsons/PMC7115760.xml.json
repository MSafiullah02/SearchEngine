The damage caused by grain mould in sorghum storage quality, food and feed processing quality, and market value. Some phytopathogenic fungi produce mycotoxins that deleteriously affect human health and reproduction. A few sorghum cultivars could evade grain mould since their grains mature only after the cessation of rains because moisture causes grain mould.",

Tris\u2013HCl buffer (10 mM, pH 7.8) was added to the resulting supernatant until a Tris concentration of 10 mM was attained. The supernatant was then applied on a 5 \u00d7 20 cm column of Affi-gel blue gel in 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 7.8). Unadsorbed proteins (fraction B1) were eluted with the same buffer while adsorbed proteins (fraction B2 with antifungal activity) were desorbed with 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 1 M NaCl. After dialysis and lyophilization, fraction B2 was subjected to cation exchange chromatography on a 2.5 \u00d7 20 cm column of SP-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) which had been equilibrated with and was then eluted with 10 mM NH4OAc buffer (pH 4.5). After unadsorbed proteins had been eluted, the column was eluted with 10 mM NH4OAc buffer (pH 4.5) containing 0.1, 0.5 and 1 M NaCl to yield fractions S1, S2 (with antifungal activity) and S3. After dialysis and lyophilization, fraction S2 was further purified by FPLC on an anion exchange Mono S (GE Healthcare) column in 10 mM NH4OAc buffer (pH 4.5). After elution of unadsorbed proteins, the column was eluted with three linear NaCl concentration gradients (0\u20130.2, 0.2\u20130.7 and 0.7\u20131 M) in 10 mM NH4OAc buffer (pH 4.5) to yield four adsorbed fractions M2, M3, M4 (with antifungal activity) and M5. Fraction M4 was subjected to final purification on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). The main peak constituted purified XILP.

The effect of xylanase inhibitor from Sorghum bicolor on the activity of xylanase at 30 \u00b0C, pH 5.5, was determined. Aliquots of xylanase were incubated with the isolated XILP (50 and 100 nM) at 30 \u00b0C, pH 5.5 for 10 min. Xylanase activity was carried out and reducing sugar groups measured by the DNS method.",

The assay takes advantage of the ability of reverse transcriptase to synthesize DNA, starting from the template/primer hybrid poly (A) oligo (dT) 15. The digoxigenin- and biotin-labelled nucleotides in an optimised ratio are incorporated into one of the same DNA molecule, which is freshly synthesized by the reverse transcriptase (RT). The detection and quantification of synthesized DNA as a parameter for RT activity follows a sandwich ELISA protocol. Biotin-labelled DNA binds to the surface of microtiter plate modules that have been precoated with streptavidin. In the next step, an antibody to digoxigenin, conjugated to peroxidase, binds to the digoxigenin-labelled DNA. In the final step, the peroxidase substrate is added. The peroxidase enzyme catalyses the cleavage of the substrate, producing a coloured reaction product. The absorbance of the sample at 405 nm can be determined using a microtiter plate (ELISA) reader and is directly correlated to the level of RT activity. A fixed amount (4\u20136 ng) of recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was used. The inhibitory activity of XILP was calculated as percent inhibition as compared to a XILP (Wong et al., 2011).\n",

Cation exchange chromatography of fraction B2 on SP-Sepharose gave rise to three fractions, S1, S2 and S3 (Fig. 1B). Antifungal activity was confined to fraction S2 eluted with 0.5 M NaCl in 10 mM NH4OAc buffer (pH 4.5). FPLC of fraction S2 on Mono S resulted in a small unadsorbed fraction M1 without antifungal activity. Elution of the adsorbed proteins with the three linear NaCl concentration gradients (0\u20130.2, 0.2\u20130.7 and 0.6\u20131 M) in 10 mM NH4OAc buffer (pH 4.5) produced four adsorbed fractions M2, M3, M4 and M5 (Fig. 1C). Antifungal activity was detected only in fraction M4. Fraction M4 was subsequently resolved on Superdex 75 into a main fraction P2 with antifungal activity and two tiny fractions P1 and P3 without activity (Fig. 1D). Fraction P2 displayed a single band with a molecular mass of 25 kDa in SDS\u2013PAGE (Fig. 2\n). The yields of the various active chromatographic fractions from 2000 g seeds were as follows: 15 537 mg crude extract, 5362 mg fraction B2 from Affi-Gel Blue Gel column, 1465 mg fraction S2 from SP-Sepharose column, 211 mg fraction M4 from Mono S column, and 43 mg P2 (XILP) from Superdex 75 column. The chromatographic behaviour of sorghum XILP on Affi-gel blue gel and cation exchangers resembles defensins (Wong, Zhang, Wang, & Ng, 2006), defensin-like peptides (Leung et al., 2008), and other antifungal proteins and peptides (Lin and Ng, 2008, Lin and Ng, 2009, Wang and Ng, 2004).

Its potency (IC50\n = 11 \u03bcM) is higher than those of many anti-HIV-1 natural products (Ng, Huang, Fong, & Yeung, 1997). The mechanism of inhibition may entail protein\u2013protein inhibition, as in the case of inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase by the homologous protease (Bottcher & Grosse, 1997). In contrast to some other antifungal proteins, sorghum XILP has no inhibitory activity toward HIV-1 integrase. Both French bean defensin-like peptide and sorghum XILP lack inhibitory activity toward HIV-1 integrase and SARS coronavirus proteinase (data not shown).",

These proteins are defence proteins or antipathogenic proteins that resist attack of noxious pathogens including fungi and viruses. They may also have antitumor activity. Sorghum XILP is thermostable and pH-stable and exhibits potent antifungal, antiproliferative, and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activities. Different fungal species and tumor cell lines are susceptible to this XILP. In view of the emergence of fungal strains with resistance to currently available drugs (Bolard, 1986) (Thevissen et al., 1996), there is a need to develop new antifungal drugs. Sorghum XILP is one such candidate.",

The N-terminal sequence of sorghum XILP exhibits some homology to xylanase inhibitors. Currently very few antifungal proteins have been reported to be xylanase inhibitors (Dash et al., 2001, Tokunaga and Esaka, 2007). Sorghum XILP isolated in this study belongs to a new class of antifungal proteins and defence proteins, the xylanase inhibitors. Previously a 26-kDa xylanase inhibitor with no sequence reported was identified as one of the antifungal proteins detected in maize suspension culture (Perri et al., 2009). A xylanase inhibitor from Bacillus sp. inhibited fungal growth in Alternaria, Aspergillus, Curvularia, Colletotricum, Fusarium, and Phomopsis species and Trichoderma sp. (Dash et al., 2001). However its sequence is unlike that of sorghum xylanase inhibitor. Sorghum xylanase inhibitor resembles xylanase inhibitors from wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa) in N-terminal sequence but not in molecular mass. No report of antifungal activity of wheat and rice xylanase inhibitor is available. Hence, xylanase inhibitors constitute a new class of antifungal proteins although information regarding xylanase inhibitors is scanty. The present report adds to the meagre literature.",
