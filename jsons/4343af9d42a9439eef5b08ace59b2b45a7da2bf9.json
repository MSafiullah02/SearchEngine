QI science provides useful tools and strategies for achieving change. While our current situation may lead us to feel that there is no time for use of formal strategies, use of a few key tools may allow us to achieve our desired results more efficiently. Consider tools such as driver diagrams, process map, and flowcharts as enablers of change. 8 These concepts can help a team quickly prepare a complex workspace for new demands. During this pandemic, our colleagues, with a variety of expertise, specialist knowledge, and drive to contribute should be given space to propose solutions and develop prototypes to solve departmental problems.

For example, protected intubation and protected code blue protocols can be sourced from peer hospitals and refined through frequent iteration. Areas of emphasis may include donning and doffing PPE safely, communicating from within negative-pressure rooms, respiratory arrests in low-acuity areas, and system-wide simulations that include emergency medical services and intensive care unit services. These allow for systems to identify latent safety threats to both staff and patients before they happen to active decompensating COVID-19 patients. Small tests of change with a single patient can help determine the viability of a concept. This is often what is tested in the simulation environment. Despite this, the question of broad implementation of these concepts requires scaled testing or PDSA cycles. 6, 7 These repetitive tests should be done with differing teams, in multiple environments, and often with several simulations happening simultaneously to model advanced pandemic scenarios and identify the largest number of latent safety threats. This type of implementation stress-testing should be considered for all new initiatives because they may reveal unintended consequences.",

However, the typical ways in which data are collected, aggregated, and presented in \"normal\" times may not be efficient enough for the required pace of change in a pandemic. As such, a simple observation of work in progress can be highly beneficial in understanding threats to reliability. For example, knowledge about errors in PPE use could be based on a few hours of dedicated observation in the ED by a redeployed staff. An assessment of adherence to doffing best practices could be based on the observations of an independent observer relative to an established checklist, rather than depending upon participation in education or the presence of reminders in the environment. Acknowledge that change fatigue will occur and take steps to mitigate. Frontline clinicians will have difficulty finding signals in the noise of the current information-saturated environment. We need to accept that this will continue to occur over the course of the pandemic. Accepting the challenges of the protocols to our end-users and making the right thing to do the easy thing to do is of utmost importance. As an example, some sites have elected to post a protectedintubation checklist on the door to each ED resuscitation room. Standardization and simplification, in process and communications, follow the tenets of the hierarchy of effectiveness. 9 5. Intentionally scale and spread.",

The opportunity to communicate and spread innovation has increased exponentially in recent years with social media technologies. Collaboration between teams, sites, and hospitals may be a great method to decrease \"investment costs\" at the early stages of planning and development. Most hospitals are deploying local human resources to develop the same protocols, responses, and strategies to solve common problems. The best use of our resources may be collaborative design followed by local refinement using QI testing principles. Furthermore, processes that are standardized across larger geographical areas often gather more public and administrative support. When successful changes are ready for dissemination, models such as the Institute for Health Improvement's Framework for Spread may provide strategic guidance. The scale and spread concept may also be applied to the development of QI capacity. Many departments and leaders have made use of distributed leadership as part of their pandemic response. Providing these distributed leaders with knowledge and skills in QI may enhance their effectiveness and simultaneously build QI capacity for future challenges. This strategy is most effective if there is a robust central coordination of efforts.",

We must empower others to do the same, while supporting them to do it rigorously. It is evident to all in the healthcare system that COVID-19 has brought a new world.
