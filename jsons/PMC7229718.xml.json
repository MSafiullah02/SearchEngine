As of May 1, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 1 million cases and 62,406 deaths in the United States, and over 3.5 million cases and 240,000 deaths worldwide [[1], [2], [3]]. Despite the majority of the focus being placed on pulmonary and cardiovascular complications, emergency medicine clinicians must remain cognizant of the neurologic complications, which can present subtly and add substantially to the morbidity and mortality [[4], [5], [6], [7]]. The following article reviews the neurologic complications from COVID-19, with an emphasis on the emergency medicine clinician.",

            "text": "A member of the beta-coronaviridae family, SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus [[8], [9], [10]]. The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 causes neurologic damage are multifaceted, including direct damage to specific receptors, cytokine-related injury, secondary hypoxia, and retrograde travel along nerve fibers [[11], [12], [13], [14], [15]]. Much like its expression on lung epithelial cells, the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier can allow viral binding at this important site, facilitating viral entry into the central nervous system by attacking the vasculature [16,17]. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 at the pulmonary epithelial cells also generates a global systemic inflammatory response (SIRS), producing increased levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, IL-15, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1); activating glial cells; and producing a massive pro-inflammatory central nervous system state [13]. In particular, IL-6 levels have been correlated with increased disease severity in COVID-19 [[11], [12], [13]]. These systemic effects combined with localized lung alveolar damage result in severe hypoxia, which can lead to cerebral vasodilation and may decompensate into cerebral edema and ischemia [13,14]. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 travels retrograde along the olfactory nerve and bulb, which provides an avenue between the nasal epithelium and the central nervous system and may also explain the common complaint of anosmia [15].",

In a recent review of patients diagnosed and hospitalized with COVID-19, 8% of the 4014 patients had pre-existing neurologic diseases, though this analysis mainly focused on those with prior strokes [6]. Interestingly, patients with prior neurologic conditions have less improvement of respiratory symptoms over their first 10 days of hospitalization and had a significantly increased risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome as compared to controls without neurologic disease [19,20]. In a separate cohort of 179 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, pre-existing cerebrovascular disease was also found to be associated with increased mortality [21]. A similar mortality trend has been demonstrated in those with Parkinson's Disease [22]. A systematic review and meta-analysis also identified a 2.5-fold increased risk of severe infection among patients with a prior stroke [23].",

However, this final common manifestation has a multifactorial etiology. SARS-CoV-2 causes a global inflammatory response and a hypercoagulable state evidenced by increased D-dimers, prolonged prothrombin time, thrombocytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation [20,27]. In an Italian cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted with confirmed infection, the rate of ischemic stroke was 2.5%, despite venous thromboembolism prophylaxis on admission [28]. In comparison, the rate of ischemic stroke in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China was estimated to be as high as 5% [24]. Similarly, there was a 3.7% incidence of ischemic stroke in Dutch COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) despite venous thromboembolism prophylaxis [29]. Interestingly, COVID-19 has also led to younger patients presenting with ischemic stroke, including large vessel occlusions [30]. Additionally, COVID-19 patients can develop significant hypoxia leading to decreased cerebral oxygenation and infarcts, particularly in those with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease [13,14]. Infection, inflammation, and hypercoagulable states can further increase the risk of ischemic stroke, which can be even more pronounced in older patients [[31], [32], [33]].",

This condition is often secondary to hematologic malignancy, immunosuppression, or critical infection, but has also been described in patients with SARS-CoV-2 [48]. HLH patients present with unremitting fevers, pancytopenia, coagulopathy, hepatic dysfunction, hypertriglyceridemia, and an elevated ferritin [[48], [49], [50]]. HLH is an underrecognized complication among COVID-19 patients as the innate immune system may result in uncontrolled cytokine storm, characterized by severely increased levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, TNF\u03b1. Up to one-third of COVID-19 patients with HLH develop neurologic abnormalities. Early recognition and scoring with the HScore allows for prompt consideration of immunosuppressive treatments (Table 1\n); an HScore of 200 predicts an 88% probability of HLH, while a score of 130 predicts a 9% probability of HLH [51]. Treatments include steroids and tocilizumab, both of which are currently under investigation for treatment in COVID-19 patients [51].",

Lopinavir/ritonavir and azithromycin interact with many common medications in patients with prior strokes including antihypertensives, antiplatelets, statins, and anticoagulants [[52], [53], [54], [55]]. These also carry an increased risk of neurocognitive impairment in longer courses [[55], [56], [57]]. Ribavirin and interferon alpha have both neuropathic and neuropsychiatric sequelae, while interferon caries a risk of retinopathy [58,59]. Similarly, antimalarials also carry the risk of neuropsychiatric side effects and less commonly ataxia, seizures, and limbic encephalitis [60]. A complete summary of mechanism of action, neurologic effects, and medication interactions can be found in Table 2\n.",
