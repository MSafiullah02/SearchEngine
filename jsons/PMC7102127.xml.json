            "text": "RSV causes significant respiratory disease, infecting almost all children during the first 2 y of life (1, 2). Indeed RSV is the most frequent cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants requiring hospitalization (3). Moreover, at least 50% of infants who have acute viral bronchiolitis because of RSV have subsequent episodes of wheezing consistent with asthma (4, 5). However, the pathophysiology of RSV bronchiolitis is unclear. RSV bronchiolitis is characterized histologically by epithelial necrosis and peribronchoalveolar infiltration with leukocytes, especially neutrophils (6, 7). We recently reported that neutrophils can augment epithelial leakage and detachment in RSV infection in vitro (8), suggesting that neutrophils and their products may have an important role in the clinical and pathologic changes occurring in RSV infection. However, it is unknown whether such epithelial damage occurs in vivo in infants with RSV bronchiolitis, as there has been no clinical measure available to detect such damage.",

The antigens are measured by ELISA inhibition assays using antibodies Po-A and Po-B raised against alveolar proteinosis-derived SP-A and mature SP-B, respectively (9\u201311). All samples are assayed in duplicate at four serial dilutions. Standards, assayed in quadruplicate, are included in each ELISA plate at eight serial dilutions (ranging from 7.8 to 1000 ng/mL). Absorbance is measured using a Dynatech MR5000 reader (Dynatech Laboratories; Chantilly, VA). An AssayZap program (Biosoft; Ferguson, MO) is used to generate a standard curve (r> 0.99) and to compute the concentrations of SP-A and SP-B. The antibodies do not react with other plasma or ELF antigens, and the assays have a coefficient of variation of approximately 6%.",

Although mature SP-B, which associates as a low Mr (approximately 18 kD) thiol-dependent homodimer (17), is normally intimately associated with complexes of surfactant phospholipids, which are possibly too large to readily breach the alveolocapillary barrier, we have previously shown that at least some of the protein is secreted into the alveolus as hydrophilic, monomeric proprotein and processing intermediate with approximate Mr of 45 kD and 25 kD, respectively (10). We have shown that these forms breach the alveolocapillary barrier more readily than SP-A (10, 11), presumably because they are smaller, and so provide a better marker of lung injury. Therefore, our finding that RSV bronchiolitis is associated with increased levels of SP-B, but not SP-A, may reflect the relative severity of the injury, the nature of the sieving properties of the lung, and the differences in the sizes of the proteins (9\u201311). This indicates that RSV bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization is associated with increased alveolocapillary permeability, but, at least in cases in which ventilatory support is not required, to a lesser extent to that which occurs in acute respiratory distress syndrome (9, 10). As far as we know, this is the first report identifying increased alveolocapillary permeability in infants with RSV bronchiolitis.",

This indicates that neither selective degradation nor consumption of alveolar SP-A, or increased SP-B synthesis, are likely to explain why plasma SP-B is elevated in our RSV-infected cohort, whereas SP-A is not. Indeed, increased leakage of SP-B may be a contributing factor to the decreased SP-B concentrations with regard to those of SP-A in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid harvested from children infected with RSV (18).",

In most cases, a common pathway involving the recruitment and activation of leukocytes, and in particular neutrophils, is thought to result in diffuse inflammatory lung injury (10). Neutrophils play an important role in lung injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome. They are also the predominant inflammatory cells in RSV infection (6, 7), and our previous in vitro study has shown that RSV infection can induce alveolar type II-like cell (A549) leakage and detachment to a certain extent, both of which are augmented by neutrophils (8). Therefore, we speculate that alveolar permeability may be increased both through the direct action of the virus, as well as through that of the neutrophils. In addition, increased work of breathing associated with airway obstruction can generate large negative alveolar pressure and cause edema (19, 20), whereas lung hyperinflation is a well-known factor increasing alveolocapillary permeability (21). However, we do not know the relative contribution of these factors to the overall alveolocapillary permeability.",

In a guinea-pig asthma model challenged with ovalbumin aerosol, it was shown that surfactant dysfunction developed, which might cause conducting airways to become blocked by liquid columns and thereby increase airway resistance (24). It has also been reported that RSV infection in BALB/c mice induced surfactant dysfunction, which may increase airway resistance (25). It seems that surfactant may play an important role in the pathophysiology of both RSV infection and asthma (25, 26). It has recently been shown that surfactant from infants with viral bronchiolitis has an increased minimum surface tension (27). Inasmuch as SP-B is essential for normal surface activity (28), possible leakage of SP-B into the circulation may reduce alveolar levels and contribute to the reduced surface activity observed by Dargaville and associates (27).",
