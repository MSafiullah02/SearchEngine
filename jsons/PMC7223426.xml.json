The novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] coronavirus 2) from Wuhan, China has continued to spread around the world since January 2020 and has turned into a pandemic of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [1,2]. Due to the rapid spreading potential and the absence of vaccines and drugs, the contagious COVID-19 devastated normal life around the world. Currently, COVID-19 has infected more than half a million of the population, has killed more than 25,000 people, and has forced more than 3 billion to stay in their homes [3]. Many people started getting pneumonia without any reason, and most of the cases were linked to Wuhan Seafood Market, where they sell fish and trade live animals. The new coronaviruses lurking around the world are threatening our rule, and the prevalence of fear and panic is increasing. This has also affected the cryptocurrency market [4,5]. The country in which the coronavirus has caused the most devastation after China is Italy. In Italy, hundreds of people are dying every day due to this deadly virus. The corona virus is 900 times smaller than a human hair. Despite its size, this small virus has scared the whole world. In December 2019, the first case of COVID-19 came from Wuhan City in China [6-8].",

The WHO [3] revealed that cases began to be detected in other countries by international travelers. Due to a lack of knowledge about this virus, the COVID-19 pandemic placed tremendous strain on everyone around the world. To prevent further transmission, strong preventive measures have intensified week-to-week; however, the numbers of infected cases are consistently increasing around the world, even after undergoing lockdown. Mathematical approaches have been widely used to infer critical epidemiological transitions and parameters of COVID-19. Epidemic curve fitting, surveillance data during the early transmission, and other epidemic models have been frequently applied to generate forecasts of the COVID-19 pandemic across the world [9-11]. This study aims to identify the top 15 countries with the most confirmed cases with spatial mapping. A comparison was done between the identified top 15 countries for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, and an advanced autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used for predicting the spread of COVID-19 trajectories for the next 2 months (until July 7, 2020).",

This research study analyzes dynamic models to generate 20-day forecasts of cumulative confirmed deaths and recoveries from COVID-19 cases by country, territory, or conveyance generated on April 24, 2020. The United States, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Iran, China, Russia, Brazil, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland were taken from the top 20 countries based on cumulative effect data. The ARIMA model assigns a weight to the considered past values and an error value to correct the modelling; other basic regression and exponential models use all past values to predict future values, so the ARIMA model is preferred. This study analyzed and extracted worldwide data based upon a time series data-based advanced prediction ARIMA model approach for the top 15 COVID-19-infected countries.",

Furthermore, we preprocessed the top 15 countries\u2019 data with their spatial locations to collect and create some spatial attributes for the overall available data sets to forecast the trajectory of COVID-19 cases. In addition, as whole worldwide data is not available for stipulated times, we did not create any worldwide pandemic forecasting. Some dates with cases of confirmed COVID-19 along with total cumulative results of recovered cases and death cases were analyzed using statistical analysis along with spatial extinct. We used the ARIMA model with R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) and validated it using Akaike information criterion (AIC). The new projected data was used up to July 2, 2020, for the creation of a trajectory projected score for each category: case confirmed, recovered, and death.",

The four models were used to analyze the aggregate data set for time series analysis.

These three variables in the GIS environment created a map of cumulative confirmed cases by country as well as recovered and death maps [16]. The use of another statistical analysis was a generalized logistic growth model, which generally is depicted as a scaling parameter for integrating an additional result-oriented value put method [17].

The United States, The United Kingdom, Turkey, China, and Russia saw a relatively fast spread of the disease. There was a fast recovery ratio in China, Switzerland, Germany, Iran, and Brazil, but a slow recovery ratio in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Russia, and Italy as shown in Figure 2. In addition, there were higher death rate ratios in Italy and the United Kingdom, and lower death rate ratios in Russia, Turkey, China, and the United States (Figure 2).",

After this, the forecast prediction model was applied by using AR and MA models to generate plots of the different trends in upcoming days. The ARIMA model was validated for the available current data using the AIC value; it estimates that the out-of-sample prediction error and lowest value are preferable. Its value were around 20, 14, and 16 for cumulative confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19, respectively, which represents less error. The outcome of these predictions is presented in Figure 3. Our findings revealed linearity in the confirmed cumulative cases and showed a rapid exponential growth phase in the world, which might occur roughly from April 8 to April 24, 2020, when the number of COVID-19 cases may rise steeply to nearly 1 million in the United States, 220,000 in Spain, 200,000 in Italy, 180,000 in France, and 190,000 in Germany. Other countries that have a smaller number of cases but show a declining upward trend include Switzerland, Germany, and Italy (Figure 2). However, the cases of COVID-19 in China remain stable (Figure 2). The ARIMA model predicted confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for the next month from April 24 to July 7, 2020, using the past 3 months of data in Figure 3 (cyan color), Figure 4 (brown color), and Figure 5 (green color) with 95% confidence intervals. Along with the 95% confidence predicted line after April 24, the 80% and 70% confidence wide values are shown in light grey and light-yellow colors, respectively. The wide confidence intervals help to manage any sudden changes in the prediction of dynamic COVID-19 cases.",

The recent reported data for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for the last 3 months from January to April 2020 was represented and compared between the top 15 infected countries. The ARIMA model was used to predict estimated confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for the top 15 countries from April 24 to July 7, 2020. Its value was represented with 95%, 80%, and 70% confidence intervals, and the 95% confidence intervals were shown as the median interval between the 80% and 70% wide values. The validation of the ARIMA model was carried out using the AIC for the available recent data; its values were about 20, 14, and 16 for cumulative confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19, respectively, which represents acceptable results. The observed predicted values showed that the confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries will double in all countries except China, Switzerland, and Germany. It was also observed that the death and recovery rates were faster when compared to confirmed cases during the next 2 months.
