            "text": "Stress granules (SGs) are discrete foci that contain cytoplasmic mRNAs. The SGs, in which the mRNAs are recruited by TIA1 (T cell internal antigen 1) and TIAR (T-cell restricted intracellular antigen related protein), are generally induced following exposure to a stressor. Mammalian TIA1 and TIAR are both ARE (adenine and uridine-rich element)\u2013binding proteins that appear to selectively downregulate TNF-\u03b1 production through post-transcriptional regulation, suggesting that they are translational silencers in un-stressed cells [1]. Both TIA1 and TIAR are essential for mammalian embryo development, but their specific functions during development are not known [2]. As RNA-binding protein, TIA1 and TIAR appear to be functionally redundant, which allows these proteins to sequestrate untranslated mRNA, preventing the initiation of translation and leading to translational arrest [1]. Both TIA1 and TIAR are activated following the stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF-2\u03b1, a translation initiation factor [3]. Once the stressor is removed, the mRNAs are released from the SGs and translated by ribosomes or degraded in processing bodies (P-bodies) [3], [4]. While there are over 500 RNA-binding proteins involved in the formation of mammalian SGs, the primary SG proteins are relatively limited, which include TIA1, TIAR, RasGAP-associated endoribonuclease (G3BP), elongation initiation factor 3 (eIF3), and poly-A binding protein (PABP) [5], [6], [7]. SG formation can be induced by overexpressing the component protein(s) including TIA1, TIAR, and G3BP. TIA1 and G3BP are thought to be the critical effectors of SG formation because truncated forms of the proteins inhibit SG formation [6], [8], [9]. Until now, very little has been known on SG biomarkers of aquatic animals and most knowledge on SG comes from the study on mammalian animals including human and mouse.",

For example, respiratory syncytial virus and coronaviruses take advantage of the SGs as translational silencers and induce SGs to inhibit host translation [10], [11], [12]. In contrast, rotavirus and cardioviruses inhibit the formation of SGs during infection to prevent the adverse effect of SGs on the translation of viral genes [13], [14]. Many viruses, including mammalian reovirus, poliovirus, semliki forest virus, and hepatitis C virus, could induce SGs during early infection to benefit from SG-mediated inhibition of host translation, but during late infection tend to inhibit SG formation to allow efficient viral replication [15], [16], [17]. Finally, TIA1 and TIAR appear to be critical for West Nile virus replication, possibly through their ability to bind specifically to the 3\u02b9 terminus of the viral minus-strand RNA template [18]. Interestingly, TIA1 can self-aggregate into novel foci that lack other SG-defining components in poliovirus-infected cells, suggesting a novel role for TIA1 independent of SGs [19].",

GCRV is considered unique among the known aquareoviruses due to its high pathogenicity [21]. There are three known types of GCRV: type I (representative strain: GCRV-873) [22], type II (GCRV GD-108) identified in 2012 [23], and type III GCRV (GCRV-104) identified in 2013 [24]. All of the GCRV strains contain a segmented double stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome and share low homogeneity with each other. However, all of the GCRV strains belong to the genus aquareovirus, which is significantly different from the genus othoreovirus\n[25]. Type I GCRV is widely regarded as the archetype aquareovirus and has been the subject of research in developing diagnostic methods, elucidating virus-host cell interactions, and characterizing viral morphology [26], [27], [28], [29]. Even with the relatively extensive knowledge pertaining to type I GCRV, little is known about the mechanisms on its replication and pathogenicity in grass carp cells. In this study, GCRV refers to the type 1 strain.",

The experiments revealed that grass carp C. idella TIA1 (CiTIA1) and G3BP1 (CiG3BP1) were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively [30], indicating GCRV might unlink CiTIA1 aggregation from SG formation that is similar to the effects of poliovirus in host cells [19]. TIA1 has not been functionally characterized in any fish species to date and potential differences might exist between fish and mammalian TIA1, which merit further characterization of this molecule as an RNA chaperon molecule in grass carp. Although GCRV can efficiently infect and replicate in CIK cells, the presence of GCRV dsRNA in host cells is a signal to induce RNA receptor-mediated antiviral innate immunity, including the RNAi pathway, which has been demonstrated to be effective in grass carp cells; recent studies also demonstrated that chemically synthesized siRNA targeting the viral dsRNA genome inhibited viral replication in CIK cells [31], [32]. Given that dsRNA-binding proteins could potentially inhibit RNAi [33], the dsRNA binding activity of CiTIA1 was investigated here both in vitro and in vivo. Since whether CiTIA1 aggregation enhances or antagonizes GCRV replication is unknown, we also analyzed the impact of over-expressed CiTIA1 on viral replication in this study.",

            "text": "TIA1 accumulation may not always be beneficial for viral infection. TIA1 has been shown to regulate TNF-\u03b1 mRNA and the alternative splicing of a variety of pre-mRNAs including the FAS receptor, suggesting TIA1 is an apoptosis-promoting protein [35]. While there are many factors that might contribute to the GCRV-induced apoptosis, expression of CiTIA1 in GCRV-infected CIK cells correlated with the development of apoptosis in GCRV-stressed cells. Here, we have shown that apoptosis-antagonizing protein CiTIA1 induced by GCRV infection might be involved in protecting cells from apoptosis during the viral replication cycle. Interestingly, the Sendai virus trailer RNA binds to TIAR, and is involved in antagonizing TIAR-induced apoptosis [36]. This observation suggests that viral RNA might also be able to inhibit apoptosis by interacting with host pro-apoptotic factors. The role of CiTIA1 might be better understood by its more positive roles in infected cells beyond apoptosis. For example, in mammalian reoviruses, viral mRNAs escape translational repression when SGs are disrupted [16].",

In the case of Mammalian reovirus (MRV) infection, the cells attempt to inhibit viral replication by activating PKR and other stress kinases, phosphorylating eIF2, inhibiting the formation of ternary complexes, and forming SGs [16]. MRV-encodes the protein \u03c33, which binds dsRNA and prevents phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2; thus, no SGs form, and neither virus nor cellular translation is inhibited [16]. However, although GCRV and MRV face similar challenges with regard to dsRNA-induced PKR activation, GCRV does not encode a protein homologous to \u03c33. The finding that CiTIA1 associated with dsRNA might suggest that CiTIA1 potentially inhibits PKR activation by sequestering the dsRNA, which could be key for the virus to survive the dsRNA-activated innate immune response.",

A previous study suggested that during mammalian reovirus infection, dsRNA-binding proteins might inhibit the RNAi pathway [33]. There is still little known about the escape mechanism used by GCRV. We have previously shown that the genomic dsRNA of GCRV was sensitive to the cellular RNAi pathway, and that unidentified RNAi suppressor protein(s) could contribute to the survival of the viral genome and efficient viral replication [31]. From the present study, an alternative hypothesis is that CiTIA1 accumulation may protect the dsRNA from Dicer cleavage and allow GCRV to escape the RNAi pathway. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that dsRNA bound by TIA1 was insensitive to degradation in vivo (Fig. 6).",

Many viruses appear to have mechanisms that disrupt the formation of SGs on viral mRNAs, suggesting that SGs are a host defense against infection. SGs have been shown to be induced by a number of viral infections and have been implicated in the cellular defense against infection [4], [19]. For example, in Semliki Forest virus infection, SG formation is inhibited when G3BP is bound and sequestered by the C-terminal domain of the viral nonstructural protein 3 [37]. Recent findings from studies of West Nile and Dengue viruses show that flaviviruses subvert TIAR and TIA1 to interfere with SG formation, aid in viral gene amplification, and to prevent translation inhibition of both viral and cellular mRNAs [38]. While there is no experimental evidence that new foci formed by TIA1 contain other SG marker proteins, they may share certain functions. Our findings that GCRV unlinked TIA1 from SG formation and subverted TIA1 to enhance viral replication were consistent with the flavivirus studies.",
