All of these products exhibited some antiviral activity against a number of viruses, that is reovirus ST3, vaccinia virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) [8, 9] . The organotin polymers from norfloxacin and ampicillin showed total inhibition to virus growth at concentrations of about 2 mg/ml, whereas norfloxacin and ampicillin, themselves, exhibited no viral inhibition. We also looked at organotin products derived from the known antiviral drug acyclovir [9] . Again, the organotin polymers showed inhibition of the viruses at lower concentration that found for acyclovir itself. Thus, the combination of known drugs with organotin moieties within polymers appear to be effective antiviral agents, more effective than either of the reactants themselves.",

These VAPs will then bind to the cellular receptor and block the virus binding [21] . Anti-idiotypic antibodies can be produced that mimic the VAP. When these antibodies are introduced into the host they bind the cellular receptors that would normally be available to infectious virus. This effectively \"blocks\" the viral receptor on the cells and prevents the virus from attaching and infecting the cell [22] . Natural ligands of the viral receptor can be employed that bind the receptor and block virus use of this receptor. One example of this is vaccinia virus and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor [23] . The fourth possibility is the use of synthetic ligands that resemble the receptor-binding domain of the VAP itself. These peptides will bind a cell receptor and render the receptor unable to bind the VAP, preventing virus infection [24, 25] . 2. Agents that mimic the viral receptor on the host cell and function by binding the VAP. Antibodies to the VAP, naturally produced as the humoral response to most viruses, bind the VAP and prevent its interaction with host cell receptors [26, 27] . Anti-idiotypic antibodies can be produced that mimic the cell receptor or extraneous receptors such as rsCD4 used by HIV [28] . When introduced into the host these antibodies serve as \"binding targets\" for the virus, but unlike the cells normally expressing these receptors, cannot be infected or support virus replication [28, 29] . Additionally, synthetic receptor mimics can be produced to bind virus before it has an opportunity to bind cell receptors. One example of this approach is the use of sialic acid derivatives to bind influenza virus [30, 31] .",

Very often there are sufficient differences between viral and cellular polymerases to provide a target for an antiviral agent without harming the unaffected agents. This strategy has yielded the majority of the antiviral drugs currently in use. Most of these drugs function as polymerase substrate, as nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. The toxicity of these drugs varies considerably from some which are well tolerated such as acyclovir [39] to others which are highly toxic such as IdU/TFT [40] and AZT [41, 42] . There is a serious problem with the pharmacokinetics of these nucleoside analogs, as most typically have short serum half lives of 1 to 4 hours [43] . Nucleoside analogues are in fact pro-drugs, meaning that to be activated they need to be phosphorylated. Acyclovir [44] (Scheme 8.5), is phosphorylated by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase 200 times more efficiently than by cellular enzymes. Gancyclovir [45] (Scheme 8.5) is 10 times more Other nucleoside analogs active against herpesviruses have been derived from Acyclovir and Gancyclovir and include Schemes 8.6-8.14. Additional nucleoside analogues with activity against HIV are shown in Schemes 8.15-8.17.",

            "text": "There are several possible crosslinks with DNA. One favored interstrand option occurs between the 6-NH groups of adenines on opposing strands in an A-T rich region [13, [83] [84] [85] [86] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] . This is because these groups are approximately 3.5 \u00c5 apart, close to the 3 \u00c5 distance between the cis leaving groups on the platinum. The second favored option is cross-linking occurring between the amino groups of guanine and cytosine in opposing strands. This is favored because the platinum is at right angles to the bases that in turn are coplaner with one another. This implies that the bases will have to either \"bend down\" or \"turn edge\" to achieve the necessary configuration to bind to the platinum complex. This binding pattern is believed to lead to perturbation of the secondary structure and minor disruption of the double helix. This is sufficient to cause inhibition of DNA replication and transcription with eventual cell death, yet too small to cause a response by damage recognition proteins and consequent excision of the affected segment and repair of the strand [13, [83] [84] [85] [86] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] .",

The most serious side effect is damage to the kidney [13, 106, 107] . Much of the administered cis-DDP is filtered out of the body within a few hours, exposing the kidneys to bursts of high concentrations of platinum.

Most strategies employing polymeric derivatives of cisplatin are based in part on the assumption that the platinum-containing polymer will act similarly to cisplatin itself. However, it is likely that at least some of these polymeric drugs act in other ways to inhibit cancer growth. Although this complicates describing overall strategies, this may be an advantage because they would operate in another manner to complement cisplatin as a drug. Thus they may operate in several ways, allowing inhibition of cancer growth to occur via several mechanisms. Even so, it may be informative to briefly look at some structure-activity relationships established for cisplatin acting as an anticancer agent.",

Thus, the following discussion should be considered as only one brief attempt at describing general structure-activity relationships. First, there should be two available anionic leaving groups such as chloride, bromide, or oxalate. Bidentate chelating groups such as dicarboxylate dianions, except for the especially labile malonato ligand, are often preferable to monodentate ligands because of their superior ability to remain intact in the bloodstream. Complexes with more labile groups such as the nitrate ion hydrolyze too rapidly for in vivo use, whereas ligands such as the cyanide ion bind the platinum too tightly impairing its activity [9, 13, 85, 103] . Further, such complexes should have the cis geometry and be neutral with relatively inert amine or nitrogen donor groups. The neutrality of the molecule is believed to allow the platinum-containing drug to more easily traverse the cell membrane. The amines should be primary or secondary amines allowing for hydrogen-bonding to occur.",

More recent activity has focused on the construction of platinumcontaining homing compounds that act specifically at the desired cancer site. For many decades now, oncologists worldwide have taken advantage of the cytotoxic action of a great variety of drug systems in the fight against cancer. However, despite undisputed successes in cancer chemotherapy, particularly in combination with surgery and other treatment modalities, numerous important pharmacological deficiencies of anticancer drugs have been well recognized in the medical fraternity. Most drugs lack cell specificity, failing to discriminate between normal and cancer cells. Thus, they tend to cause severe and dose-limiting systemic toxicity. As extraneous agents, they immediately expose themselves as targets for scavenger proteins or as substrates for glomerular filtration and first-pass liver metabolism. As a consequence, serum residence times are commonly short, predominant fractions of administered doses are prematurely excreted (and wasted in the process), and bioavailability (concentration in the target tissue) is generally low. Many drugs are polar, charged, or salt-like. Therefore, they are poor substrates for membrane penetration, intracellular trafficking, and cell entry by the passive diffusion mechanism common to neutral and nonpolar compounds. In addition, drugs possessing poor solubility in aqueous media are sluggishly and incompletely dissipated in the central circulation and become easy targets for the reticuloendothelial system. Lastly, and most importantly, acquired drug resistance, which gradually builds up in the target cells after initially successful chemotherapy, is a relatively common phenomenon requiring premature treatment termination. The overall result of these shortcomings is a narrow therapeutic window and grossly limited overall chemotherapeutic effectiveness.",

Cationic sites in a polymer are known to facilitate pinocytosis while at the same time increasing affinity for the neoplastic cell, which in many cancers is negatively charged. Lastly, the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect associated with macromolecules, in contrast to small compounds, provides preferred distribution of polymers to tumorous tissue.

Cisplatin itself is rapidly excreted from the body causing the kidney and other organs to be exposed to high concentrations of platinum. Polymers with chain lengths of about 100 units and greater typically are unable to move easily through biological membranes. Restricted movement may prevent a build-up in the kidneys and other organs thereby decreasing renal and other organ damage. Further, the platinum from polymers could be released slowly, reducing the exposure of organs to large concentrations of platinum-containing complexes. 2. It may enhance activity through an increased opportunity for multiple bonding interactions at a given site (e.g., chemical bonding, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions). 3. It should increase delivery of the bioactive moiety and decrease toxicity. In aqueous solutions, cisplatin hydrolyzes with a reaction half-life of nine hours at room temperature or 2.4 hours at 37 \u00b0C. Cisplatin hydrolyzes in the body forming a wide variety of platinum-containing agents, none of which is as active as cisplatin itself and most of which exhibit increased toxicity to the body. Formation of these hydrolysis products increases the amount of platinum complex that must be added to effect desired tumor reduction. Consequently, this increases the amount of platinum complexes that must be processed by the body. The polymeric structure should also shield the platinum moiety from unwanted hydrolysis increasing the concentration of platinum in the beneficial form that is retained in the body thus permitting lower effective doses of the drug to be used. The nature of the more hydrophobic polymer chain should also act to protect the platinum moiety from ready attack by water. 4. It should by-pass the cell's defense system. The cell's defensive response is armed as a result of invasion of other chemo drugs. Recent studies are indicating that introduction of chemo drugs into cells causes the buildup of \"housekeeping\" proteins that are rather general in their ability to select and remove foreign compounds present in the cell. This may be a principal reason why chemo treatments lead to resistance to drugs, even to drugs that have not been previously used. It is possible that the polymeric nature of the platinum carriers will discourage the housekeeping proteins from removing them allowing the polymers to function as anticancer drugs under conditions where smaller platinum-containing drugs are not successful.",

A virus reduction of about 25% was seen. This is considered to be a moderate antivirial response. In general, agents capable of inhibiting one RNA virus will inhibit other RNA viruses but each DNA virus must be evaluated separately. The platinum polyamines were studied against RNA viruses.
