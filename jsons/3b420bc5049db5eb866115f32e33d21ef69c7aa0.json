In the process of epidemic prevention and control, more than 40 hospitals in Wuhan have been expropriated as NCP designated hospitals, most of them are public hospitals. The beds number for NCP patients increased from more than 5000 to 23 thousand in one month, of which 9000 beds were for severe patients. Sixteen mobile cabin hospitals have been built and opened with 13 348 beds, which are taken over by public hospitals or military system medical personnel. It fully proved that the public hospitals are the main battlefields of the epidemic, and the national medical teams are mainly public medical and military medical personnel. Huazhong University of Science and Technology is the university that invests the most beds and medical staff in China. It has 10 affiliated hospitals (Tongji Hospital, Union Hospital, Liyuan Hospital, Puai Hospital, etc.), 8900 beds, 33 000 medical staff devoted to fighting \"epidemic\" [10] , and has undertaken the rescue and treatment of severe patients. China's national system and the basic nature of medical services determine that the medical services of public hospitals are more accessible, higher quality and lower price. Especially in major public health emergencies, public hospitals respond quickly, medical staff are more subjected to deployment, and the emergency mechanism is easier to start [11] . Therefore, taking the NCP as a guide, we must further strengthen the main position and main force role of public hospitals.",

However, NCP is unknown and refractory at first. In the face of NCP outbreak, the number of patients continues to increase, which affects the normal operation and management order of the hospital. Hospitals are facing increasing difficulties and pressures. The difficulties of bed resource shortage, equipment shortage, medical materials shortage and medical staff shortage are increasingly prominent. The NCP patients can't be implemented in time and in full, resulting in a high mortality rate in Hubei, especially in Wuhan. As of 24:00 on March 14, 2020, the mortality rate in Hubei Province is 4.55%, that in Wuhan City is 4.91%, and that outside Hubei Province is 0.87%, which has attracted great attention of the central government [12] . More than 40 000 medical and nursing personnel were sent to Hubei and Wuhan successively from 29 provinces, regions and cities, Xinjiang production and Construction Corps and military system [13] . The support of medical forces from other provinces plays an important role in preventing the epidemic. This incident reflects that it is urgent to strengthen the construction of public hospitals, promote the development of public hospitals, especially improve their ability to cope with major public health events.",
