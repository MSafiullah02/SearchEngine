", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Antiviral compounds (AVCs) inhibit the development of viruses in the host cell and are relatively harmless to the host. [1] They can be natural, for example, antivirals found in turmeric [2] and eucalyptus oil, [3] or synthetic, for example, zidovudine (a nucleoside analog) [4] and Tamiflu (neuraminidase inhibitor). [5] Many compounds and drugs have also been tested and found to be useful in restricting the growth of certain viruses. [6, 7] Scientists are endeavoring to broaden the range of antivirals to other families of viruses. [8] However, designing safe and effective antiviral drugs is a difficult task due to the high genetic diversity and consequent drug resistance in viruses. [9] Initially, antivirals were discovered using traditional trial-and-error methods. [10] However, it was a very lengthy process for discovering effective antivirals. [10, 11] Later, research on virology helped to identify many target pathways to block viral multiplication. [12, 13] Scientists are now using rational drug design strategies for developing antivirals that target the viruses at different stages of their life cycles. [14] During the past decade, many new drugs have been successfully identified in controlling the viral replication in host cells, for example, maraviroc (inhibits human immunodeficiency virus or HIV entry), pleconaril (inhibits picornavirus uncoating), acyclovir (inhibits herpesvirus replication), and oseltamivir (inhibits influenza release). [9, 15] To save time and money for discovering a new drug, researchers have widely used various computational methods to screen virtual libraries of compounds before the synthesis and animal testing of chemicals. Among the different approaches, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) is mostly used. [16] [17] [18] In this approach, relationships connecting molecular descriptors and activity are used to predict the property of other molecules. [19] Molecular descriptors transform the chemical information (structure and linking of groups) of a molecule into simple numbers. [20] QSAR-based virtual screening is an effective computational technique leading toward identification and design of novel antiviral agents. [21] Lately, many dedicated bioinformatic resources have been developed for antivirals. For example, in the area of RNA interference resources published are VIRsiRNAdbantiviral siRNAs resource for about 42 disease causing viruses, [22] HIVsirDB-anti HIV siRNAs database, [23] VIRsiRNApred-antiviral siRNA inhibition efficacy predictor, [24] and VIRmiRNA-database of virus encoded miRNAs including antiviral miRNAs. [25] Similarly, for peptide-based antivirals, a few web servers have also been created like AVPdb-collection of antiviral peptides targeting more than 60 medically important viruses, [26] HIPdb-HIV inhibiting peptide repository, [27] and AVPpred-predictor of antiviral activity of peptides. [28] . Many general depositories provide information of antiviral molecules. For example, ChEMBL, [29] PubChem-a database of molecules and their activities, [30] ZINC-database of commercial compounds for virtual screening, [31] and DrugBank-a knowledgebase for drugs and drug targets. [32] In addition, there are a few QSAR studies targeting specific viral proteins. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] However, till date there is no web server/software, which can regressively predict the percentage inhibition value of a compound against different human viruses under a single platform.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 120, "end": 123, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 187, "end": 190, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 211, "end": 214, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 275, "end": 278, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 318, "end": 321, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 438, "end": 441, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 442, "end": 444, "text": "7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 537, "end": 540, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 692, "end": 695, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 777, "end": 781, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 859, "end": 863, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 864, "end": 867, "text": "11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 967, "end": 971, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 972, "end": 975, "text": "13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1129, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1470, "end": 1473, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1474, "end": 1477, "text": "15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1783, "end": 1787, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1788, "end": 1792, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1793, "end": 1797, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1929, "end": 1933, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2060, "end": 2064, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2202, "end": 2206, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2433, "end": 2437, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2473, "end": 2477, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2538, "end": 2542, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2617, "end": 2621, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2800, "end": 2804, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2846, "end": 2850, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2908, "end": 2912, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3006, "end": 3010, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3065, "end": 3069, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3131, "end": 3135, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3193, "end": 3197, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3275, "end": 3279, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3280, "end": 3284, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3285, "end": 3289, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3290, "end": 3294, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3295, "end": 3299, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3300, "end": 3304, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3305, "end": 3309, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3310, "end": 3314, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3315, "end": 3319, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E AVCpred: an integrated web server for prediction and design of antiviral compounds Abid Qureshi | Gazaldeep Kaur | Manoj Kumar"}, {"text": "To cater this need, we developed AVCpred, a web server for prediction and design of antiviral compounds.

[56, 57] Finding new and improved viral inhibitors is a major concern in the treatment of deadly human viruses. [58, 59] However, discovery of novel AVCs is a tedious process. [60] To speed up the identification of new AVCs, a computational approach using QSAR method is a rational strategy to decrease cost and time efforts in the wet laboratory. [20] QSAR techniques have been widely used in drug designing and further identification of lead molecules. [17] Although there are many QSAR studies pertaining to different types of viral protein inhibitors, they are very specific in their approach and deal with a particular class of inhibitors such as endonuclease inhibitors [33] in which 40 compounds were used and reached a correlation of 0.76, thiourea derivatives [34] where 85 compounds had a correlation of 0.92, protease inhibitors [39] in which 170 compounds had a correlation of 0.60-0.83, and flavonoid inhibitors [38] where 20 compounds had a correlation of 0.75-0.97 etc. (Table 5 ). In most of the cases, the studies are carried out on a limited number of inhibitors. Due to this reason, they predict the inhibitors that are similar to the compound type with a high correlation, but do not work on other dissimilar inhibitors for the same target virus. To address these limitations, AVCpred models have been developed using diverse and large number of inhibitors. In the current algorithm, we have employed antiviral compound datasets from different studies due to which the overall correlation is less than above studies, yet the models are comparatively more robust to predict different classes of inhibitors. However, as new high-throughput screening data tested under homogeneous conditions on antiviral drugs becomes available, performance of the QSAR method can be improved.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 80, "end": 84, "text": "[56,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 85, "end": 88, "text": "57]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 192, "end": 196, "text": "[58,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 197, "end": 200, "text": "59]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 256, "end": 260, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 428, "end": 432, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 535, "end": 539, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 756, "end": 760, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 849, "end": 853, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 920, "end": 924, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1005, "end": 1009, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1065, "end": 1073, "text": "(Table 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "| 81"}, {"text": "In this study, we developed virus specific as well as general prediction models to identify the likelihood of a compound being antiviral using selected chemical attributes of experimentally validated AVCs.
