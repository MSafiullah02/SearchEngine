RNA samples from LCM were isolated using RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (Life Technologies) and amplified as cDNA with Full Spectrum Complete Transcriptome RNA Amplification Kit (System Biosciences). qPCR was performed as given the ratio. To do this, the distribution of intensities and their ratios were examined visually, and it was observed that the data for day 16 was significantly different from the other three days in both conditions. Hence, the data for day 16 was removed for subsequent analysis. To compute the statistical significance of differential expression, the distribution of intensity ratios for all genes were modeled as a mixture of three distributions, each component representing those genes underexpressed in infected cells, equal expression in both cells, and overexpressed in infected cells, respectively: .",

Right panel: Graph shows the protein expression profile of HIF1-\u03b1 and ANGPTL4 mRNA level (red). The peak of HIF1-\u03b1 protein expression (at day 13 post infection) did not coincide with the peak ANGPTL4 mRNA expression (at day 5 post infection) (means\u00b1s.e.m, n=3).

After 48 h, cells were treated with either recombinant IL6 (20 ng/mL) or vehicle for 12 h before harvesting for RNA and protein analysis.Lung Damage Scoring. The extent of lung damage from H&E stained lung sections was scored by a trained histophatologist (J.E. Seet, National University Hospital, National University Health System, Singapore) in a double-blinded fashion using scoring criteria as previously described(Matute-Bello et al., 2001). Percentage of significant lung damage, alveolar haemorrhage, alveolar infiltrates, fibrin and alveolar septal congestion were examined. With the whole lung considered as 100%, percentages of significantly damaged lung regions were defined to meet at least 2 criteria of alveolar haemorrhage, alveolar infiltrates, fibrin and alveolar septal congestion.Microarray data processing. To obtain mRNA expression data, the raw data (.CEL) were processed using the Affy package and mogene10stv1cdf / mogene10sttranscriptcluster.db libraries in Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org, with R 3.0.2). All gene level annotation data (such as gene IDs, chromosomal location, Gene Ontology membership) were mapped using the bioconductor utilities. This process generated intensity measurement for 34,760 transcript clusters (probesets) at all four time-points in both control and infected samples. Since some transcript clusters mapped to the same genes, intensity data were averaged for a unique gene ID (Entrez ID), resulting in a processed dataset with 8 samples and 20,694 genes.Mixture model and statistical significance. To identify differentially expressed genes during the time course between infected and uninfected cells, the ratios of intensities between the two conditions were calculated at each time-point for each of the 20,694 genes. Statistical significance was then calculated in the form of the posterior probability of differential expression",
