We leveraged our existing Enterprise ASP prospective audit platform to contribute to the response. Here we describe the logic and development of COVID-19 ASP flags, which were rapidly operationalized in the enterprise electronic medical record (EMR).",

We elected to incorporate both the PCR result and potential COVID-19 therapies into the rule logic because flagging the medications alone would not filter out non\u2013COVID-19 indications, leading to the addition of low value flags or \u201cnoise\u201d into the system. We considered flagging only PCR-positive patients, but this approach would fail to identify pending testing or PCR-negative patients who remained on potentially inappropriate medications. Conversely, incorporation of all ordered PCRs would also have contributed a great deal of noise. We developed a hybrid approach by designing 2 flags that identify opportunities for stewardship of medications and confirm infectious diseases (ID) consultation.",

Despite the 2 studies by Gautret et al5,6 claiming the benefit of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, we deliberately omitted azithromycin from the \u201cactive therapy\u201d list.5,6 We recognized that despite significant weaknesses in this literature, providers may still order the combination; however, including azithromycin would have introduced flags for appropriately prescribed azithromycin for non\u2013COVID-19 indications. Additionally, patients prescribed the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin would be flagged by the hydroxychloroquine order, thus making azithromycin inclusion unnecessary.",

Our Enterprise team felt that review of all PCR-positive patients would be important to ensure appropriate involvement of the ID team, consideration for enrollment in clinical trials, and candidacy for off-label therapy. Had we stopped here, we would have realized a gap in the ability to review patients for which tests were ordered and pending. This feature was particularly important for facilities within the enterprise with a slower PCR turnaround time. The second criterion is an inpatient with a pending test, but to limit noise, the rule is only triggered when there is also an \u201cactive therapy\u201d order. This criterion prompts the reviewer to use the flag \u201cdefer\u201d logic for follow-up of test results so that, if positive, it may be re-reviewed by the ASP team. If the result is negative and therapy order remains active, ASP COVID-19 rule 1 is triggered.",

Notably, we are not currently an epicenter of the outbreak, and we recognize that, for facilities experiencing a high volume of COVID-19 hospitalizations, the tools described may not be applicable or may need modification prior to implementation. The landscape of COVID-19 management is rapidly evolving. Therefore, we remain nimble in our ability to add or subtract medications from the \u201ctargeted therapy\u201d list, and we understand that as SARS-CoV-2 community prevalence or testing recommendations change, the rules should be modified to produce the highest benefit within limited ASP resources. Another factor that contributed to the success of our design is the availability of an internally developed SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Facilities desiring to use test results as an element of the logic in their ASP triggers should assure that, regardless of testing location, the result is discretely documented in the EHR.",
