Nelfinavir clearly inhibited the cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by infection with SARS-CoV (Fig. 1A\n). We also examined the replication of SARS-CoV by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with a serum sample from a patient with SARS. Expression of viral antigens was much lower in infected cells treated with nelfinavir than in untreated infected cells (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we assessed the effect of nelfinavir on the production of virions. Nelfinavir significantly blocked the production of virions as revealed by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2\n). By the use of MTT assay, we determined the concentration of the compound that reduced cell viability to 50% (CC50), the concentration of the compound required for inhibition of CPE to 50% of the control value (EC50), and the selectivity index (SI). Nelfinavir inhibited SARS-CoV replication at non-toxic doses with an approximate SI of 300, while the other inhibitors against HIV-1 protease (ritonavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, indinavir, TYA5, TYB5, and KNI-272) did not affect the replication of SARS-CoV (Table 1\n). These results revealed that nelfinavir is active in inhibiting SARS-CoV replication.",

            "text": "Nelfinavir is a very safe and widely used inhibitor of the HIV-1 protease, with strong in vivo activity in HIV-infected patients. Nelfinavir is generally used in combination with other antiretroviral medications as part of a highly active antiretroviral regimen (HAART) [21]. When used in this manner, 50\u201375% of patients who are naive to antiretroviral therapy have plasma HIV RNA levels below the limit of detection in association with an approximate increase of 200 mm\u22123 CD4(+) lymphocytes at 12 months of therapy [22], [23], [24], [25]. The most common side effect of nelfinavir is mild diarrhea, which is observed in 15\u201320% of patients [26]. Nelfinavir is well tolerated by patients with HIV infection. Due to these characteristics, nelfinavir has become one of the most frequently prescribed first line protease inhibitors in the treatment of HIV-infected individuals.",
