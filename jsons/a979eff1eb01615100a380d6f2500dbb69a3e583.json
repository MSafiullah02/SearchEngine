Today, most of us are probably happy that some things are forgotten, but in an AmI world, everything may be remembered and nothing forgotten -if not in an individual memory then somewhere in the AmI system. Furthermore, unlike most traditional computer applications, interactions in an AmI world are often envisioned to be initiated by technology (e.g., reminding a person to do something or opening an office door after verifying a user), which could be privacy-invasive in some situations, for example, if the AmI system reminds a user to pop his Prozac at a time when the user is in an important business meeting.",

For providing anonymity, it is also necessary to use special communication protocols which do not use device IDs or which hide them. It is also necessary to implement authorisation for accessing the device ID: currently, most RFID tags and Bluetooth devices provide their IDs upon any request, no matter who actually asked for the ID. Another problem to solve is that devices can be distinguished by their analogue radio signals, and this can hinder achieving anonymity. Additionally, by analysing radio signals and communication protocols of a personal object, one can estimate the capabilities of embedded hardware and guess whether this is a new and expensive thing or old and inexpensive, which is an undesirable feature. Unobservability can be implemented to some extent in smart spaces and personal area networks (PANs) by limiting the communication range so that signals do not penetrate the walls of a smart space or a car, unlike the current situation when two owners of Bluetooth-enabled phones are aware of each other's presence in neighbouring apartments.",

On the other hand, the \"code\" has the potential to regulate by enabling or disabling certain behaviour, while law regulates via the threat of sanction. In other words, software and hardware constituting the \"code\", and architecture of the digital world, causing particular problems, can be at the same time the instrument to solve them. Regulating through code may have some specific advantages: Law traditionally regulates ex post, by imposing a sanction on those who did not comply with its rules (e.g., in the form of civil damages or criminal prosecution).

Or should the law change \"code\" and thus ensure that certain values are protected? 36 The development of technology represents an enormous challenge for privacy, enabling increasing surveillance and invisible collection of data. A technology that threatens privacy may be balanced by the use of a privacy-enhancing technology: the \"code\", as Lessig claims, 39 can be the privacy saviour. Other technologies aim to limit the amount of data actually collected to the necessary minimum. However, most of the current technologies simply ignore the privacy implications and collect personal data when there is no such need. A shift of the paradigm to privacy-bydesign is necessary to effectively protect privacy. Indeed, technology can facilitate privacy-friendly verification of individuals via, for example, anonymous and pseudonymous credentials. Leenes and Koops recognise the potential of these privacyenhancing technologies (PETs) to enforce data protection law and privacy rules. 40 But they also point at problems regarding the use of such technologies, which are often troublesome in installation and use for most consumers.

Such protection could be extended to the digital movement of the person, that is, just as the privacy protection afforded the home has been or can be extended to the individual's car, so the protection could be extended to home networks, which might contact external networks. 49",

More drastic, prohibitive measures may be necessary in certain situations involving too far-reaching or unnecessary surveillance, which a society considers as infringing upon the dignity of the employee. 51 In addition, transparency rules are needed to regulate other, less intrusive problems. We recall here the specific role of law-making institutions in the area of labour law. Companies must discuss their surveillance system and its usage in collective negotiations with labour organisations and organisations representing employees before its implementation in a company or a sector, taking into account the specific needs and risks involved (e.g., workers in a bank vs. workers in public administration). All employees should always be clearly and a priori informed about the employee surveillance policy of the employer (when and where surveillance is taking place, what is the finality, what information is collected, how long it will be stored, what are the (procedural) rights of the employees when personal data are to be used as evidence, etc.). 52 Specific cyber territories for children have to be devised along the same lines. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1990) contains a specific privacy right for children, and sets up monitoring instruments such as National Children's Rights Commissioners. Opinions of such advisory bodies should be carefully taken into account in policy discussion. National Children's Rights Commissioners could take up problems relating to the permanent digital monitoring of children.",

All these criteria should be considered as safeguards for privacy. The e-signature Directive promotes the use of pseudonyms and, at the same time, aims to provide security for transactions. 63 Currently, the Directive on electronic signatures states that only advanced electronic signatures (those based on a qualified certificate and created by a secure signature-creation device) satisfy the legal requirements of a signature in relation to data in electronic form in the same manner as a handwritten signature satisfies those requirements in relation to paper-based data and are admissible as evidence in legal proceedings. Member States must ensure that an electronic signature (advanced or not) is not denied legal effectiveness and admissibility as evidence in legal proceedings solely on the grounds that it is: (a) in electronic form, (b) not based upon a qualified certificate, (c) not based upon a qualified certificate issued by an accredited certification service-provider, or (d) not created by a secure signature-creation device. 64 In ambient intelligence, the concept of unlinkability can become as important as the concept of anonymity or pseudonymity. Unlinkability \"ensures that a user may make multiple uses of resources or services without others being able to link these uses together. \u2026 Unlinkability requires that users and/or subjects are unable to determine whether the same user caused certain specific operations in the system.\" 65 When people act pseudonymously or anonymously, their behaviour in different times and places in the ambient intelligence network could still be linked and consequently be subject to control, profiling and automated decision-making: linking data relating to the same non-identifiable person may result in similar privacy threats as linking data that relate to an identified or identifiable person.",

This is, however, a more technological definition: It \"explicitly disconnects the technical and the legal/political dimensions from interoperability, assuming that the former are neutral and the latter can come into play later or elsewhere. \u2026 Indeed, technological developments are not inevitable or neutral, which is mutatis mutandis also the case for technical interoperability. The sociology of sciences has shown that any technological artefact has gone through many small and major decisions that have moulded it and given it its actual form. Hence, the development of information technology is the result of micro politics in action. Technologies are thus interwoven with organisation, cultural values, institutions, legal regulation, social imagination, decisions and controversies, and, of course, also the other way round. Any denial of this hybrid nature of technology and society blocks the road toward a serious political, democratic, collective and legal assessment of technology. This means that technologies cannot be considered as faits accomplis or extrapolitical matters of fact.\" 75 This way of proceeding has also been criticised by the European Data Protection Supervisor, according to whom this leads to justifying the ends by the means. 76 Taking into account the need for interoperability, restrictions in the use and implementation of interoperability are required based on the purpose specification and proportionality principles.

Nevertheless, while the default position of data protection is transparency (\"Yes, you can process, but \u2026\"), it does not exclude opacity rules (\"No, you cannot process, unless \u2026\"). In relation to profiling, two examples of such rules are relevant. On the one hand, of course, there is the explicit prohibition against taking decisions affecting individuals solely on the basis of the automated application of a profile without human intervention (see Article 15 of the Data Protection Directive). 99 This seems obvious because in such a situation, probabilistic knowledge is applied to a real 97 We recall that personal data in the EU Data Protection Directive refers to \"any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person\" (Article 1). 98 The role of data protection law and non-discrimination law in group profiling in the private sector.\" 99 Article 15 on automated individual decisions states: \"1. Member States shall grant the right to every person not to be subject to a decision which produces legal effects concerning him or significantly affects him and which is based solely on automated processing of data intended to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to him, such as his performance at work, creditworthiness, reliability, conduct, etc. 2. Subject to the other Articles of this Directive, Member States shall provide that a person may be subjected to a decision of the kind referred to in paragraph 1 if that decision: (a) is taken in the course of the entering into or performance of a contract, provided the request for the entering into or the performance of the contract, lodged by the data subject, has been satisfied or that there are suitable measures to safeguard his legitimate interests, such as arrangements allowing him to put his point of view; or (b) is authorized by a law which also lays down measures to safeguard the data subject's legitimate interests.\" person. On the other hand, there is the (quintessential) purpose specification principle, which provides that the processing of personal data must meet specified, explicit and legitimate purposes. As a result, the competence to process is limited to welldefined goals, which implies that the processing of the same data for other incompatible aims is prohibited. This, of course, substantially restricts the possibility to link different processing and databases for profiling or data mining objectives. The purpose specification principle is definitely at odds with the logic of interoperability and availability of personal data: the latter would imply that all databases can be used jointly for profiling purposes. 100 In other words, the fact that the legal regime applicable to profiling and data mining is data protection does not give a carte blanche to mine and compare personal data that were not meant to be connected. 101 The European Data Protection Supervisor indicated in his Annual Report 2005 a number of processing operations that are likely to encompass specific risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, even if the processing does not occur upon sensitive data. This list relates to processing operations (a) of data relating to health and to suspected offences, offences, criminal convictions or security measures, (b) intended to evaluate personal aspects relating to the data subject, including his or her ability, efficiency and conduct, (c) allowing linkages, not provided for pursuant to national or Community legislation, between data processed for different purposes, and (d) for the purpose of excluding individuals from a right, benefit or contract. 102",

Granting him property over the data 106 is seen as giving him control over the information and its usage in a \"distribution chain\". However, it is doubtful if granting him property over the data will really empower the individual and give him a higher level of protection and control over his data. The property model also assumes that the data are disseminated under a contract. Thus, the question might arise whether the Data Protection Directive should serve as a minimum standard and thus limit the freedom of contracts. 107 But as our dark scenarios show, there exist many cases in which the individual will not be able to freely enter into a contract. Another question arises since our data are not always collected and used for commercial purposes. In most situations, the processing of personal data is a necessary condition for entering into a contractual relation (whereas the Data Protection Directive states in Article 7 that data processing without the individual's consent to use of his personal data is legitimate when such processing is necessary for the performance of a contract). The most obvious example is the collection of data by police, social insurance and other public institutions. The individual will not always be free to give or not give his data away. The property model will not address these issues. It will also not stop the availability of the data via public means. 108 A weakness of the property model is that it might lead to treating data only as economic assets, subject to the rules of the market. But the model's aim is different: the aim is to protect personal data, without making their processing and transfer impossible. Regarding data as property also does not address the issue of the profile knowledge derived from personal data. This knowledge is still the property of the owner or the licenser of the profile. The data-as-property option also ignores the new and increasingly invisible means of data collection, such as RFIDs, cameras or online data collection methods.",

The AmI environment will need the innovation and creativity of service providers; therefore, one should refrain from creating a framework discouraging them from taking risks. However, some procedural rules could help consumers without upsetting an equitable balance. The consumer, usually the weaker party in a conflict with the provider, often has difficulty proving damages. Reversing the burden of proof might facilitate such proof. Most national laws seem to provide a similar solution. 151 Since national law regulates the issue of service liability, differences between national regulations might lead to differences in the level of protection. The lack of a coherent legal framework for service liability in Europe is regrettable. Learning from the differences and similarities between the different national legal regimes, as indicated in the Analysis of National Liability Systems for Remedying Damage Caused by Defective Consumer Services, 152 is the first step in remedying such a situation.",

In that respect, the new Regulation should be welcomed. The Regulation will apply from January 2009. Some other legislative acts also contain rules on applicable law. Most important are provisions in the Data Protection Directive. This Directive also chooses the territorial criterion to determine the national law applicable to the processing of data, which is the law of the place where the processing is carried out in the context of an establishment of the data controller. Such a criterion, however, might be problematic: more than one national law might be applicable. 190 Moreover, in times of globalisation of economic activity, it is easy for an undertaking to choose the place of establishment, which offers the most liberal regime, beyond the reach of European data protection law. In situations when a non-EU state is involved, the Directive points out a different relevant factor, the location of the equipment used, 191 thus enabling broader application of the EU Data Protection Directive. 192 189 As recital 10 of the proposal states, these amendments aim to take into account the developments in distance selling, thus including ICT developments. 190 Article 4 (1) of the Directive stipulates: Each Member State shall apply the national provisions it adopts pursuant to this Directive to the processing of personal data where: (a) the processing is carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of the controller on the territory of the Member State; when the same controller is established on the territory of several Member States, he must take the necessary measures to ensure that each of these establishments complies with the obligations laid down by the national law applicable. 191 The Directive stipulates in article 4 (1) that the national law of a given Member State will apply when the controller is not established on Community territory and, for purposes of processing personal data, makes use of equipment, automated or otherwise, situated on the territory of the said Member State, unless such equipment is used only for purposes of transit through the territory of the Community. 192 The Article 29 Data Protection Working Party interprets the term \"equipment\" as referring to all kinds of tools or devices, including personal computers, which can be used for many kinds of processing operations. The definition could be extended to all devices with a capacity to collect data, including sensors, implants and maybe RFIDs. (Active RFID chips can also collect information. They are expensive compared to passive RFID chips but they are already part of the real world.) See Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, Working document on determining the international application of EU data protection law to personal data processing on the Internet by non-EU based websites (5035/01/EN/Final WP 56), 30 May 2002. http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/ fsj/privacy/ docs/wpdocs/2002/wp56_en.pdf As we see, in all these cases, the territorial criterion (establishment) prevails. We should consider moving towards a more personal criterion, especially since personal data are linked with an identity and a state of the data subject (issues which are regulated by the national law of the person). Such a criterion could be more easily reconciled with the AmI world of high mobility and without physical borders. The data subject will also be able to remain under the protection of his/her national law, and the data controller/service provider will not have the possibility of selecting a place of establishment granting him the most liberal treatment of law. 193",

            "text": "Data transfer is another issue highlighting the need for international co-operation in the creation of a common playing field for AmI at the global level. What is the sense of protecting data in one country if they are transferred to a country not affording comparable (or any) safeguards? Also, the globalisation of economic and other activities brings the necessity of exchanging personal data between the countries. The Data Protection Directive provides a set of rules on data transfer to third countries. 194 Data can be transferred only to countries offering an adequate level of protection. The Commission can conclude agreements (e.g., the Safe Harbour Agreement) with third countries which could help ensure an adequate level of protection. The Commission can also issue a decision in that respect. However, the major problem is enforcement of such rules, especially in view of the fact that some \"safeguards\" rely on self-regulatory systems whereby companies merely promise not to violate their declared privacy policies (as is the case with the Safe Harbour Agreement). Attention by the media and consumer organisations can help in the enforcement of agreed rules. The problem of weak enforcement also emphasises the need to strengthen international co-operation with the aim of developing new enforcement mechanisms. Providing assistance in good practices in countries with less experience than the European Union would also be useful. 193 Such a solution has the advantage of covering, with the protection of EU legislation, third country residents whose data are processed via equipment in the EU. A broad interpretation of the term \"equipment\" would help guarantee the relatively broad application of such a rule (see above). As a result, in most cases, application of the domicile/nationality rule or the place of the equipment used as the relevant factor would have the same result. However, we can envisage the processing of data not using such equipment, for example, when the data are already posted online. Then the EU law could not be applicable. 194 See chapter 3, section 3.4.8.1.",

The criminal law is a basic means to fight hackers, attackers and others tending to abuse the possibilities of communication. Moreover, effective criminal provisions have a general deterrent effect, thus stopping people from undertaking criminal activities.Cybercrime has cross-border dimensions and global implications. The restrictive interpretation of criminal laws (\"nulla poena sine crimen\") requires international consensus on the definition of the different crimes.

We should then think about adjusting the liability rules to such an environment. If it is difficult to distinguish between hardware and software from a technological perspective, why should we draw such a distinction from a legal perspective? 137 An explicit provision providing for strict liability for software can be considered. 138 Nevertheless, such a proposal is controversial as it is said to threaten industry. Since software is never defect-free, strict liability would expose software producers unfairly to claims against damages. Thus, the degree of required safety of the programmes is a policy decision. 139 Strict liability could also impede innovation, especially the innovation of experimental and lifesaving applications. 140 Others argue that strict liability might increase software quality by making producers more diligent, especially, in properly testing their products. 141 Despite these policy considerations, there are some legal questions about the applicability of strict liability to software. The first question is whether the software can be regarded as \"goods\" or \"products\" and whether they fall under the strict Actions allowing consolidation of the small claims of individuals could be also examined (i.e., group consumer actions).",

This makes non-discrimination law of increasing importance for AmI. The creation of profiles does not fall under non-discrimination law 158 (potential use), but decisions based on profiling (including group profiling based on anonymous data) that affect the individual might provide the grounds for application of the non-discrimination rules. They apply in the case of identifiable individuals as well as to anonymous members of the group. 159 Profiles or decisions based on certain criteria (health data, nationality, income, etc.) may lead to discrimination against individuals. It is difficult to determine when it is objectively justified to use such data and criteria, and when they are discriminatory (e.g., the processing of health-related data by insurance companies leading to decisions to raise premiums). Further legislative clarity would be desirable.However, certain negative dimensions of profiling still escape the regime of non-discrimination law (e.g., manipulation of individuals' behaviour by targeted advertising). Here no remedies have been identified.The non-discrimination rules should be read in conjunction with the fairness principle of data protection law. The application of the two may have similar aims and effects; they might also be complementary: Can the limitations of non-discrimination law be justified if they are regarded as not fair, as in the example of insurance companies raising premiums after processing health data? They can address a range of actions undertaken in AmI, such as dynamic pricing or refusal to provide services (e.g., a refusal of service on the grounds that no information (profile) is available could be regarded as discriminatory).Non-discrimination rules should be taken into consideration at the design stage of technology and service development. 158 However, such issues might be addressed by the data protection legislation. In the opinion of Gutwirth and De Hert, principles of data protection are appropriate to cope with profiling. ",
