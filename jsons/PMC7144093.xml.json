In response to the Westminster incident, the HART (hazardous area response team) was called. During the de-briefing several lessons have been reinforced. After the major incidents in London, victims were rapidly triaged to five or six hospitals with consideration to capacity across the city. A senior clinician said after the London Bridge attack, \u2018having staged a mock event in the trust during the previous year when the casualties started to arrive all the training kick-in and the staff did a fantastic job\u2019. In Manchester an estimated 400 extra staff came in to cope with the casualties. Many came in before a major incident was announced because people heard it on the media. A similar response was seen in London when staff from the nearby hospital ran to the scene. It was also noted how the pressure on staff continued weeks and months after the events as many victims remained in hospital. These plans are all contained in the EPRR framework and supporting documents1, 2, 3, 4 updated in August 2017. The Civil Contingencies Act (CCA) 20045 makes clear the responsibilities of NHS hospitals. The structure of the response by the local services, NHS England, Public Health England and the Department of Health is shown in Figure 1\n. All category 1 responders (includes acute trusts) have an EPRR framework. Major incident planning is part of mandatory training for consultants.",

Incidents such as H1N1 flu were planned for and managed with some disruption to elective work but no compromise of care. Systems to flex bed usage (surge planning), such as knowing how many patients across a network can be ventilated in recovery areas, is an example.
