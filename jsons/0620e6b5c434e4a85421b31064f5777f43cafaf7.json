Based on the current epidemiological investigation, the incubation period is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days. Fever, dry cough, and fatigue are the main manifestations [1] . With the spread of the epidemic, other cases have been found in other parts of China and abroad. The sources of infection seen so far are mainly patients with new type of coronavirus infection, which are mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact. Patients diagnosed with this disease must be treated in isolation. Through clinical observation, many patients developed anxiety and sleep disturbances after isolation treatment.

The trainee chooses a relaxed supine position, and starts with the hand through the hospital call system under the guidance of the medical staff, followed by the upper limbs, shoulders, head, neck, chest, abdomen, and finally the lower limbs. Right, if the trainer first left arm and then right arm, the rest of the movement can follow this principle. During muscle tension, the action can be performed for 10-15 s, and the relaxation process can be 15-20 s; each group of muscles is repeatedly trained 3 times in sequence; the training time is generally selected once at noon and before falling asleep, each time 20-30 min.

The results of studies on the effects of progressive muscle relaxation on anxiety levels in young women [5] , prenatal anxiety [6] , and early breast cancer [7] female patients are consistent with this study. In addition, our study found that PMR also affects the quality of sleep in patients with COVID-19. Previous studies have shown the impact of this technology on the sleep quality of other patients, and found that PMR can reduce complications and improve sleep quality of patients with fractures [8] .

The reason for the decrease in anxiety of patients after PMR training may be the balance between the anterior and hypothalamic nucleus. By reducing the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, side effects of stress and anxiety can be prevented, and physical and mental relaxation can be increased [10] . Similar to other studies, patients in this study achieved relaxation by learning how to regularly tighten and relax muscles and identify symptoms of stress. However, studies have shown that the technology has no significant effect on improving patients' sleep problems compared to other rehabilitation methods. The study of the effect of progressive muscle relaxation on sleep quality in emergency trauma patients by Masih [11] and others is inconsistent with the results of this study. Although there were significant differences in sleep quality scores before and after the intervention in the experimental group, there was no significant difference between them. In a study by Hasanpour-Dehkordi [12] and others on patients with chronic pain, two methods of muscle relaxation and hypnosis were used to reduce pain, but the results showed that neither method was effective. The inconsistency between our results and the above results can be attributed to the study population. The variables studied are related to the psychological fear caused by the current patients' insufficient understanding of the COVID-19. According to the results of this study, progressive muscle relaxation has a positive effect on improving sleep quality and reducing anxiety in patients with COVID-19. Due to the strong contagion of COVID-19, isolation treatment and the effects of drugs on patients increase their levels of anxiety and sleep disorders. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that the PMR regimen be taught to the caregiver and done by the patient, and compared with other adjuvant therapies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 466, "end": 470, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 896, "end": 900, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1172, "end": 1176, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The limitations of our study are the individual differences and psychological conditions of the sample, the influence of environmental and cultural factors on the individual, and the patient's attention during the hospital stay.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Limitations"}, {"text": "Committee Number: HGHEC: 20200115003.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ethics"}, {"text": "DZW conceived of the initial idea for the study and helped to study design.
