Her oxygen saturation was 85% on room air. Two days prior to the current presentation, a rapid influenza antigen assay was performed on a nasopharyngeal swab from the patient; the result was negative. Out of concern for bacterial pneumonia, antimicrobial therapy with ciprofloxacin was initiated at that time. In the emergency department, her complete metabolic panel and complete blood count were within normal limits, and a chest X-ray was negative for pleural effusion, pneumothorax and consolidation. She was admitted to the hospital for observation. A repeat nasopharyngeal swab was collected for influenza testing using a nucleic acid amplification assay, which was positive for influenza A. The primary physician from the skilled nursing facility called the laboratory to inquire about a possible explanation for the discrepant results observed between the rapid influenza antigen test and the nucleic acid amplification assay.",

This is a process by which two distinct subtypes of influenza simultaneously infect a single cell, creating progeny virions with segmented genomes derived from random combinations of the original two viruses.4 Influenza A has a broader host range, including birds, humans, and other mammals, and as a result has a greater potential for reassortment events between unrelated subtypes.3 Such events can lead to the creation of strains with greatly increased pathogenicity and the potential for pandemic spread. In spring of 2009, a new strain of influenza, pH1N1, emerged from a recombination event in swine. This strain spread rapidly, eventually leading to a worldwide pandemic. This subtype continues to persist among the circulating subtypes of seasonal influenza.3,6-9 Other virulent subtypes of influenza persist at low levels with the potential to be a threat to public health globally; for example, avian-derived H5N1 has caused several outbreaks with high rates of mortality,3,4,10-12 and H7N9, first reported in 2013, has also been responsible for several outbreaks with high mortality.13,14",

Respiratory symptoms are often accompanied by more generalized systemic symptoms including fever, malaise, weakness and fatigue.5 Diagnosis can be difficult since many of these symptoms are nonspecific and overlap with those caused by other common respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, or adenovirus, and thus a specific clinical diagnosis can be challenging. However, identification of influenza specifically as the etiologic agent of disease can be important for several reasons, including initiation of antiviral therapy and appropriate infection control measures.15 The antiviral therapy available for the treatment of influenza includes neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir, and M2 ion channel inhibitors, such as amantadine. Influenza B is inherently resistant to amantadine, and oseltamivir resistance has been associated with some strains of influenza A. Therefore, knowledge of the influenza subtype causing infection can provide information regarding antiviral resistance.",

In hospitals without a rapid diagnostic modality for the recognition of influenza, it has been estimated that approximately 10% to 35% of cases were preventable had there been earlier recognition of infectious contacts.17,18 These studies support the use of isolation practices to limit the spread of influenza during outbreaks, a practice reliant upon the prompt and accurate identification of infected individuals.",

Laboratory methods for the diagnosis of influenza include direct (or indirect) immunofluorescence, viral culture, rapid antigen detection and molecular detection.3,4,7Table 1 highlights some of the key differences between these methodologies. Molecular diagnostics are becoming increasingly common. Based on participation data from College of American Pathology (CAP) surveys, the number of laboratories utilizing molecular methods increased from approximately 217 in 2013 to approximately 360 in 2014. However, this pales in comparison to the use of rapid antigen tests which, according to CAP survey participation data, were used in at least 2,205 laboratories in 2013 and increased to 2,900 in 2014.\n",

Following inoculation, cultures are typically incubated at 37 \u00b0C and examined microscopically for evidence of viral cytopathic effect and/or stained with fluorescent antibodies to detect viral particles in the cells.7 Since viral culture requires extensive technical expertise, can have a prolonged turnaround time (up to a week) and is a potential biosafety concern as a result of viral propagation, many laboratories have abandoned it in favor of performing antigen testing and/or molecular methods directly on patient samples.",

The responsibility of test manufacturers to mitigate the risks of inaccurate influenza testing has been recognized by both professional and government agencies. As a result, the FDA has proposed a reclassification of these devices from Class I in vitro devices (IVDs) to Class II IVDs with special controls to create specific performance and evaluation criteria that must be adhered to by each RIDT manufacturer.32 The first standard established was that each RIDT, when compared to viral culture, must demonstrate 90% sensitivity for influenza A (lower bound of 95% confidence interval of at least 80%) and 80% sensitivity for influenza B (lower bound of 95% confidence interval of at least 70%). Specificity for RIDTs when compared to culture should be at least 95% (lower bound of 95% confidence interval of at least 90%) for both influenza A and influenza B. Specific minimal criteria for comparison to molecular methods were also given, including a sensitivity of 80% for both influenza A and influenza B (lower bound of 95% confidence interval of at least 70%). In addition, it is no longer acceptable to solely compare a RIDT to a previously existing RIDT to determine analytical performance characteristics for the purpose of FDA approval. As an additional quality measure, verification of assay performance must be conducted annually with contemporary circulating strain(s). Finally, in the event of an emergency, all manufacturers must be able to test emergent influenza strains within 30 days. It is hoped that the introduction of these new standards allows for ongoing quality assurance and improved patient safety.",

There are currently five FDA-approved syndromic panels for respiratory infections: FilmArray Respiratory Panel (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC, Salt Lake City, UT), eSensor Respiratory Viral Panel (GenMark Diagnostics, Carlsbad, CA), the Luminex x-TAG Respiratory Viral Panel and the Luminex x-TAG RVP FAST assay (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Austin, TX) and the Verigene Respiratory Pathogens Flex Test (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) Table 2.37,38 The Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel requires a nucleic acid extraction step, followed by multiplex RT-PCR amplification. Amplified targets with oligonucleotide tags are hybridized to beads, which are detected using Luminex 100/200 platform. This assay is capable of detecting 12 respiratory viruses, is usually performed in batch mode, and can be completed in approximately 8.5 hours for the Luminex xTAG RVP Assay, and can detect eight targets in approximately five hours for the Luminex xTAG RVP FAST Assay.39-42 The FilmArray Respiratory Panel, which detects 20 different respiratory pathogens in less than one hour, utilizes nested multiplex PCR, with the first stage PCR amplifying the specified targets and the second stage PCR amplifying targets using real-time PCR on an array. The software utilizes DNA melt-curve analysis to generate a result for each target. All steps, including sample lysis, nucleic acid purification, reverse-transcription, nested PCR and melt-curve analysis occur within the test pouch.43 The GenMark eSensor Respiratory Viral Panel can detect 14 respiratory viruses in approximately 6.5 hours with one hour of hands-on time. Nucleic acids are extracted, followed by amplification on a thermocycler. Amplicons are then loaded into the eSensor cartridge and detected using electric current detection of the amplicons bound to gold-plated electrodes.44 Both the Luminex xTAG assays and the GenMark assays require separate steps for extraction, amplification and detection. The direct manipulation of amplicons increases the risk for contamination in the laboratory and may require separate areas for pre- and post-amplification. The most recently FDA-approved panel, the Verigene Respiratory Pathogens Flex Test, has minimal hands-on requirements (less than 5 minutes), with amplification and detection occurring within a single cartridge (less than 2 hours run time). This test detects 16 different viral and bacterial targets. Unlike the other syndromic panels, the Verigene test offers a flexible option in which the user can order (and pay for) only a subset of the targets. If additional targets are needed later, these can be unlocked and do not require an additional sample or reagents.38 In addition to the other viral and bacterial targets, all syndromic panels are capable of identifying both influenza A and B and influenza A subtypes (H1 and H3).The eSensor Respiratory Virus Panel and FilmArray Respiratory Panels are also capable of identifying the pH1N1 subtype.\n",
