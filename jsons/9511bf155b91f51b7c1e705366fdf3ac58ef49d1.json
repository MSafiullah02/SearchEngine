            "text": "The term autophagy comes from the Greek words \"phagy\" meaning eat and \"auto\" meaning self. Autophagy is an evolutionarily highly conserved self-digestive process in response to environmental stress to eukaryotic cells, by which cytoplasmic components such as defective/damaged or redundant organelles or protein aggregates are delivered to the lysosome for recycling and degradation. There is convincing evidence indicating that activation of the autophagic process is promoted by MAMPs and/or DAMPs [2, 3] . In more simple words, autophagy is a classical cellprotective and cell-autonomous process of the innate immune system aimed at maintaining and restoring homeostasis at both the cellular (cell-intrinsic) and organismal (cell-extrinsic) level [4] . Although autophagy was initially identified in mammals, a significant breakthrough in our understanding of how autophagy is controlled came from the analysis in the genetically tractable yeast system. Pioneering work from Ohsumi's group showed that the morphology of autophagy in yeast was similar to that documented in mammals [5] . (As known, Ohsumi received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2016.) In fact, the discovery of the autophagyrelated genes in yeast has significantly advanced the understanding of the molecular mechanisms participating in autophagy and the genes involved in regulating the autophagic pathway. Many yeast genes have mammalian homologues, confirming that the basic machinery for autophagy has been evolutionarily conserved along the eukaryotic phylum [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

Thus, although autophagy substrates can be endogenous such as damaged cellular organelles or exogenous such as viruses or bacteria escaping phagosomes, autophagy acts on entities that are freely accessible to cytosolic proteins. This property is essential in order to distinguish between autophagic responses and branches of vesicular trafficking that originate at the plasma membrane, which also culminates in lysosomal degradation. Such endocytic processes include phagocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and macropinocytosis, that is, processes which will be dealt with in Part VI, Sect. 22.6. Of note, however, some forms of autophagy and the endocytic pathway interact at multiple levels, and the molecular machinery responsible for the fusion of late endosomes (also known as MVBs) or autophagosomes with lysosomes is essentially the same [11] .",

Thus, the 26S proteasome (Box 18.1) degrades a large number of misfolded cytoplasmic proteins that have been ubiquitinated (for (poly)ubiquitination, see Box 18.2) as well as properly folded proteins that expose specific degradation signals, such as the socalled N-degrons [13] . On the other hand, the proteasome system shares some substrates with different forms of autophagy whereby these two catabolic pathways differ drastically in their final products. Thus, proteasomal degradation results in short peptides that are not necessarily degraded further but may flow into additional processes including but not limited to antigen presentation/cross-presentation at the plasma membrane, thereby generating MHC-II and MHC-I epitopes (compare Part VIII, Chap. 31). By contrast, lysosomal proteases fully catabolize polypeptides to their constituting amino acids which eventually become available for metabolic reactions or repair processes. Together, as summarized [10] , bona fide functional autophagic responses navigate cytoplasmic material of endogenous or exogenous origin to degradation within lysosomes (or late endosomes, in specific cases).",

In more detail, the process begins with the formation of a membrane of unknown origin, the initial phagophore or isolation membrane. The phagophore then expands, surrounds proteins or organelles, sequesters cytoplasm, and, on completion, develops into a large double-membrane transport vesicle, the autophagosome. Subsequently, the autophagosome fuses with a lysosome containing acid hydrolases and releases its contents into the lytic acid hydrolases-containing compartment as part of single-membrane vesicles, termed autophagic bodies. The fused compartment where the autophagic body and its contents are degraded is called an autophagolysosome or autolysosome ( Fig. 18.1) . Notably, the process of phagophore expansion three classes of enzymes. E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme) hydrolyzes ATP and forms a thioester-linked complex between itself and ubiquitin. E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme) receives ubiquitin from E1 and forms a similar thioester-linked intermediate with ubiquitin. E3 (ubiquitin ligase) finally binds both the E2 and a substrate and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin to the substrate. Ubiquitin itself is often a substrate for further ubiquitylation, which results in the formation of so-called polyubiquitin chains. Ubiquitin has seven lysine residues, and depending on the lysine residue used for ubiquitin-ubiquitin chain formation, the polyubiquitin chain can signal different functions. Proteins modified by lysine-48 (K48)-or lysine-29 (K29)-linked chains are usually degraded by the proteasome. In contrast, modification by K63-linked chains or by a single ubiquitin moiety (monoubiquitylation) seems to trigger other functions, e.g., protein sorting, gene expression, and DNA repair.",

Initiation of autophagy requires the UNC-51like kinase 1 (ULK1)-ATG13-FIP200 (also known as RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1) complex, whereby the kinase activity of ULK1 is controlled by the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which is sensitive to rapamycin [9] . The next process, membrane nucleation, requires the Beclin1/ class III PI3K complex, which also plays a major role in membrane trafficking and restructuring involved in autophagy [15, 17] ; the final process refers to the elongation, expansion, and closure of the phagophore membrane/autophagosome which mainly relies on ATG8/microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) lipidation. In fact, ATG8/LC3 lipidation is regarded as a hallmark of autophagy and is established by a covalent linkage of cytosolic LC3 to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine on the surface of the autophagosome [7, 9] .",

Studies on yeast showed that ER-phagy is characterized by the fact that stress-induced ER whorls are selectively taken up into the vacuole, the yeast lysosome. Import into the vacuole was found not to involve autophagosomes but occurs through invagination of the vacuolar membrane, indicating that ER-phagy is topologically equivalent to microautophagy [27] .

Though microautophagy is the least studied form of autophagy, a molecular signature of the process has begun to emerge and has led to the definition of microautophagy as a type of autophagy in which the cargo is directly internalized in small vesicles that form at the surface of the lysosome/vacuole or late endosomes (multivesicular bodies), respectively [10] .",

For example, the recent identification of a plethora of new CMA substrates and deficiencies in CMA associated with diverse human pathologies has expanded our understanding of the importance of CMA in multiple cellular functions.

Moreover, autophagy has been shown to be required for the liberation/active secretion of ATP by dying cancer cells [39, 40] . In addition, autophagy was found to contribute to the regulation of the DDR at multiple levels, that is, a process associated with the emission of DAMPs [37, 41] (for DDR, see Sect. 18.6). Via emission of DAMPs, eventually, together with MAMPs, autophagy can amplify or even instigate MAMP/DAMP-PRM signalling leading to efferent innate immune responses.",

Moreover, as reviewed elsewhere [1] , autophagy has been found to inhibit both NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasome activation and subsequent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 (for inflammasomes, see Part VI, Sects. 22.4.2 and 22.4.4).

For example, HMGB1 was demonstrated to be an important regulator of autophagy in various types of cancer cells and keratinocytes. Mechanistically, the reduced form of the HMGB1 protein was proposed to be responsible for the promotion of autophagy in an AGER/RAGE-dependent fashion [47, 48] . Also, and of high interest, in a clinical study on patients with chronic hepatitis B, HMGB1-induced autophagy was found to maintain Treg function during chronic viral infection [49] . Moreover, in studies on a mini pig lung IRI model, evidence was provided indicating that autophagy, when triggered by DAMPs such as HMGB1 and HSP60 during IRI, amplifies the inflammatory response through enhancing K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 and activation of the downstream MAPK and NF-\u03baB signalling (for TRAF6, MAPK, and NF-\u03baB signalling, see Part",

In other words, via DAMPs, autophagy as a cell-intrinsic stress response can fortify its defending capability by providing a link to promotion and regulation of cell-extrinsic efferent innate immune and eventually subsequent adaptive immune responses.",

One such issue concerns the definition of autophagy-dependent cell death. As discussed and summarized [10] , autophagy-dependent cell death can be defined as a form of RCD (see next chapter) that can be retarded by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of macroautophagy. In this context, as stressed by Galluzzi et al. [10] , it is important to note that (1) specificity issues affect most, if not all, pharmacological agents employed so far for suppressing macroautophagic responses and (2) multiple components of the macroautophagy machinery have autophagy-independent functions. In view of these facts and findings, these authors recommend to favor genetic approaches and to test the involvement of at least two different proteins of the macroautophagy apparatus in a specific instance of RCD before etiologically attributing it to macroautophagy.",

To understand any discussion on a role of ROS in host defense or human diseases, one should define free radicals. According to Halliwell and Gutteridge [58] , \"a free radical is any species capable of independent existence that contains 1 or more unpaired electrons.\" An unpaired electron is one that occupies an atomic or molecular orbital by itself. Radicals can be formed by the loss of a single electron from a non-radical, or by the gain of a single electron by a non-radical. In this sense, superoxide anions (O 2 \u00b7\u2212 ), hydroxyl radicals ( \u00b7 OH), peroxyl radicals (RO 2 \u00b7 ), and alkoxyl radicals (RO\u02d9) are oxygen radicals. Of note, ROS is a collective term often used by scientists to include not only the oxygen radicals but also some non-radical derivatives of oxygen such as H 2 O 2 , hypochlorous acid (HOCl), ozone (O 3 ), and singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ). Nitrogen-containing oxidants, such as NO \u00b7 are called RNS. Generation of ROS is generally a cascade of reactions that starts with the production of superoxide anions. Superoxide rapidly dismutases to H 2 O 2 either spontaneously (especially at the low pH) or catalyzed by SOD. Other elements in the cascade of ROS generation include the reaction of superoxide with NO to form the very toxic peroxynitrite, the peroxidase-catalyzed formation of HOCl from H 2 O 2 , and the iron-catalyzed Fenton reaction, leading to the generation of hydroxyl radical.",

There is a definite role of XOR in reperfusion of tissue and organs [59, 60] . For example, experiments performed in isolated rat hearts have demonstrated that radical generation and functional injury are decreased by inhibition of XOR with oxypurinol.

The family comprises seven members, including NOX1, NOX2 (formerly termed gp91phox), NOX3, NOX4, NOX5, DUOX1, and DUOX2 [63] . Three members out of the enzyme family are important sources of ROS in the vasculature, namely, NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 [64] [65] [66] . Today, NOXes are perhaps the best-studied enzymes involved in ROS production in the blood vessels. Remarkably, different members of the NOX/DUOX family engaged in IRI are localized in various cells, that is, in vascular cells and phagocytes. This may lead to the notion that NOXes in vascular cells are responsible for the first wave of ROS production because vascular cells are first confronted with reintroduced molecular oxygen. As generally believed, there is, in fact, no vascular specific NOX isoform but rather a complex expression of various NOX isoforms in different cells and regions of the vascular system. Nevertheless, in arteries from humans and animals, NOX2, NOX4, and a shallow level of NOX1 have been consistently found to be present both as messenger RNA and as protein [63] . Altogether, the findings and data briefly described here make clear that vascular cells are equipped with efficient machinery able to efficiently produce ROS. Regarding the different enzymatic sources, superoxide radicals appear to be predominantly generated compared, for example, to hydroxyl radicals.",

            "text": "Mitochondria have been implicated as potential oxygen sensors by increasing the generation of ROS which regulate a variety of hypoxic responses [67] [68] [69] [70] . In fact, mitochondria are increasingly recognized as lynchpins in the evolution of tissue injury during postischemic reperfusion. It is generally acknowledged that the majority of intracellular ROS production is generated in the mitochondrial ETC and its associated metabolic enzymes. However, very little is known about which mitochondrial sites are involved in physiological or pathological ROS production under native conditions. Of note, using inhibitors to manipulate the redox states of particular sites and prevent superoxide generation from others, at least ten different locations of superoxide/H 2 O 2 production in the ETC and associated enzymes (Krebs cycle, \u03b2-oxidation, etc.) have been identified in mammalian mitochondria. In fact, the relative and absolute contributions of specific sites to the production of ROS in isolated mitochondria depend very strongly on the substrates being oxidized, and the same is likely valid in cells and in vivo [71] . For example, superoxide formation occurs on the outer mitochondrial membrane, in the matrix, and on both sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 18.3) . Complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) accepts electrons from NADH; these electrons are carried to complex II (the succinate dehydrogenase-CoQ oxidoreductase), where they are used to oxidize succinate to fumarate. Afterward, electrons continue to travel down their electrochemical gradient to complex III (the cytochrome bc1 complex (ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase)), and subsequently to complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase); finally, the electrons are used to reduce molecular oxygen to water. Thus, complex I and complex II oxidize the energy-rich molecules NADH and flavin adenine dinucleotide H 2 , respectively, and then transfer the resulting electrons to ubiquinol that carries it up to complex III (for competent articles, see [72, 73] Notably, complexes I and II generate superoxide within the mitochondrial matrix, whereas complex III produces superoxide at the Qo site, resulting in the release of superoxide into either the intermembrane space or the matrix. Regarding complex I, it was recently demonstrated that inhibition of ND5, a subunit of complex I, suppresses the activity of this complex and thus ROS production [74] . Furthermore, data from another set of studies on complex I showed that stable down-modulation of its subunits GRIM-19 and NDUFS3 decreased complex I activity that was associated with a significant reduction in the overall NADH oxidation rate but with an increased production of ROS by the target cells [75] . Similar results have been found in studies on complex II: there is evidence suggesting that inhibition of complex II on the level of subunits even leads to an increase in ROS production. The phenomena can be explained by assuming that, if electrons provided in the course of the ETC cannot efficiently be transferred to the next complex, they would leak out from the inhibited complex and generate ROS [76] .",

The Rieske iron-sulfur protein is an essential subunit of mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complexes and, like the majority of mitochondrial proteins, is encoded by a nuclear gene and synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes as a precursor with a 32-residue amino-terminal extension. The iron-sulfur protein is then post-translationally imported into the mitochondria where it is inserted into the bc1 complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane. At first, the precursor is translocated via translocation contact sites into the matrix. There, cleavage to an intermediate containing an 8-residue extension occurs. The intermediate is then redirected across the inner membrane, processed to the mature subunit, and assembled into complex III. arterial SMCs and isolated pulmonary artery segments. Further, in this article, it was discussed that mitochondria are not the only source of ROS during hypoxia. Thus, studies using a genetic knockout of p47phox suggested that cytosolic NADPH oxidase systems may also contribute to a hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction response during acute hypoxia [81, 82] . According to the authors' conclusion, the blockade of hypoxia-induced ROS responses (in these studies observed with depletion of RISP) suggests that the mitochondria may act as the initiators of ROS production, which could be amplified by engagement of NADPH oxidase systems elsewhere in the cell. Such \"ROS-induced ROS release\" might permit small ROS signals generated by mitochondria to activate ROS signalling throughout the cell, thereby avoiding mitochondrial damage that might arise if the entire cellular oxidant signal originated from that organelle [83] (or even leading to excessive ROS production?).",

As a fourth defense system, the antioxidant nutrients such as vitamins E and C as well as carotenoids were appreciated [84] . It was generally accepted that the first line of enzymes is of enormous importance in limiting ROS-mediated damage to intracellular macromolecules. For example, among the most important regulators of ROS levels were the SOD enzymes: Cu/ ZnSOD in the cytoplasm and outer mitochondrial space and MnSOD exclusively in the inner mitochondrial space. Mechanistically, superoxide is converted to H 2 O 2 and oxygen (O 2 \u00b7\u2212 + O 2 \u00b7\u2212 + 2H + \u2192 H 2 O 2 + O 2 ) by SOD. Peroxiredoxins and abundant catalase enzyme then scavenge H 2 O 2 , converting it to molecular oxygen and water. Another example of a first-line defense molecule is TRX. Thioredoxin contains two adjacent -SH groups in its reduced form which are converted to a disulfide in oxidized TRX. Notably, it can undergo redox reactions with multiple proteins using the reaction TRX",

Because certain compounds of the chemicals generated after an interaction of ROS with macromolecules are highly reactive, there must be an equal necessity to detoxify these secondary oxidation products to prevent them from also damaging DNA, proteins, and lipids. Without the adequate detoxification of such products, an extended chain reaction will occur resulting in the degradation of cellular components and the ultimate death of the cell. This second line of defense against ROS is provided by those detoxifying enzymes. Finally, detoxified metabolites produced by these enzymes are eliminated from the cell by energy-dependent efflux pumps such as the glutathione S-conjugate transporter, also called the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) [58] .",

            "text": "Recently, the molecular signalling mechanism involved in the Keap1 \u2194 Nrf2 pathway has been further elucidated and specified. The core can be seen in an axis consisting of redox change (Subclass IIC-4 DAMPs)-initiated \u2192 Keap1-induced \u2192 Nrf2-triggered \u2192 ARE-driven expression of antioxidant and detoxifying genes ( Fig. 18.4 ) (discussed in [92-94, 97, 98] ). The complex and complicated sequelae of the pathway are simplified in the following text. Under homeostatic and stress-free conditions, binding of Keap1 to the Nrf2 molecule leads to its polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasomal pathway, thereby maintaining a consistent generation of Nrf2 and retaining its very low levels in the cytoplasm. In this scenario, Keap1 homodimer binds to a single Nrf2 protein via a high-affinity so-called \"ETGE\" motif and low-affinity so-called \"DLG\" motif. The twosite recognition of Nrf2 by the Keap1 dimer is essential for polyubiquitination of Nrf2 (also see Part II, Sect. 5.3.2) (for polyubiquitination, see Box 18.2) . In this sense, the Keap1 \u2194 Nrf2 system can be regarded as a vital part of regulating cells under a homeostatic environment. However, in case of dangerous and threatening oxidative (and xenobiotic) stress, the system instigates a stress response that is characterized by a rapid and dramatic cessation of the Keap1-dependent polyubiquitination process resulting in a rapid increase of Nrf2 abundance. In fact, exposure to ROS-mediated stress (or electrophilic stress) is thought to modify the reactive \"IIC-4 DAMPs-sensing\" cysteine residues in Keap1, which is associated with a conformational change of the protein resulting in a loss of Keap1 ubiquitination activity (Fig. 18.4) . Notably, as a cysteine-rich protein, the human Keap1 possesses 27 cysteine residues, and they are all reactive to stress to varying degrees. Among these sensor cysteines of Keap1, C151 is best characterized. Evidence from a number of studies has suggested that C151 is the most reactive and critical to the Keap1 \u2194 Nrf2 stress-sensing response. Even, there is already evidence from a first atomic-level view suggesting that the unique environment of Cys 151 (besides Cys171, Cys273, and Cys288) appears to be the critical residue of Keap1 responsible for detecting increased levels of oxidative stress [91, 92, 97] .",

The \"hinge-and-latch\" model holds that the modification of the sensing cysteine residues of Keap1 reduces its affinity for Nrf2 but does not result in release. Instead, newly synthesized Nrf2 is translocated to the nucleus to trigger the transcription of Nrf2-dependent genes. The other model denoted as the \"conformation cycling\" model claims that Keap1 uses a cyclic mechanism to target Nrf2 for polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. An important feature of this cyclic mechanism is that it ensures regeneration of Keap1 which allows the cycle to proceed. Modification of specific reactive cysteine residues of Keap1 may block the cycle of Keap1-dependent Nrf2 degradation allowing de novo synthesized Nrf2 to accumulate.",

Further, TLR agonists were found to modulate Keap1 at the protein post-translation level through autophagy.

Thus, the Keap1 \u2194 Nrf2 system has been found to be also present in zebrafish, fruit fly, and Caenorhabditis elegans indicating that its roles in cellular defense are conserved throughout evolution among vertebrates and suggesting that analogous defense systems are widely conserved throughout the animal kingdom [101, 102] .",

Thus, oxidative stress is known to contribute to many pathological conditions, including cancer, neurological disorders, atherosclerosis, hypertension, ARDS, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, just to mention a few of them. Plausibly, these disorders are motivation enough to search for new effective therapeutic options by harnessing the new insights into mechanisms of the Keap1 \u2194 Nrf2 system. Certainly, intense research is essential for a detailed understanding of the precise consequences of targeting Keap1 for disease prevention and treatment. All the more so as the oxidative stress response is integrated into other forms of innate stress responses that will be further outlined in the following subchapters.",

This defense response is characterized by the expression of a group of phylogenetically conserved intracellular HSPs, which possess the capacity to recognize structures commonly found in the interior of proteins and to bind such structures. Thanks to this property, they form a chaperone network involved in correct protein folding, trafficking, and complex assembly (for reviews, see [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] ). In order to be released from engagement with proteins after folding and take part in further rounds of activity, HSP70 and other chaperones utilize an intrinsic ATPase domain to hydrolyze ATP and assume a free conformation [110] . Once released, HSPs mediate protective cellular defense mechanisms including regulation of apoptosis, the aim being to maintain and restore cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis).",

For example, HSF1 is activated by environmental stress including oxidative and tumor-associated stress [125, 126] . Notably, in all eukaryotes, HSF1 responds to such stress conditions by undergoing a monomer to trimer transition and becomes massively phosphorylated, leading to its acquiring ability to bind to DNA rapidly and activate transcription [127] . There is at least preliminary evidence suggesting that intracellular perturbations reflecting dyshomeostatic DAMPs may activate HSFs [128] [129] [130] [131] . Such molecular alterations reportedly include changes in cytosolic Ca 2+ concentration, for example, caused by increase of fluidity in specific membrane domains [128, 129] . Interestingly, a recent study in support of these earlier findings provided evidence of the existence of a plasma membrane-dependent mechanism of HSF1 activation in animal cells, which is initiated by specific membrane-dependent TRPV calcium channel-like receptors [130] . These findings lend support to the notion that heat sensing and signalling in mammalian cells are dependent on TRPV channels, suggesting that these receptors may act as a major HSR sensor in different epithelial non-cancerous and cancerous cells, capable of triggering the cellular HSR [130] . In another line of experiments, TRPV2 was demonstrated to mediate the effects of transient heat shock on endocytosis of human monocyte-derived DCs, suggesting a central role of TRPV2 in mediating the cellular action of heat shock on these important cells of the innate immune system [131] (for TRPV channel receptors, also compare Part II, Sect. 5.3.6).",

Likewise, bacterial infections were also reported to promote induction of the HSR [136, 137] .

The ER delivers these components to their destination compartments which include the ER itself, the Golgi apparatus, the plasma membrane, and the extracellular milieu or the endocytic and autophagic pathways.

            "text": "To cope with ER stress, cells have the unique possibility to activate the UPR, a dynamic signalling network that orchestrates the recovery of homeostasis or triggers RCD modalities, depending on the level of damage. Perception of any perturbation of the ER is provided by three sensor molecules of the UPR embedded in the ER membrane: the PERK, IRE-1, and ATF6. The UPR-mediated recovery of ER homeostasis mainly occurs through the PERK-eIF2\u03b1-mediated temporary shutdown of protein translation and the activation of a complex genetic program that aims to improve ER quality control and adaptive responses [140] [141] [142] [143] (Fig. 18.6) . Accordingly, PERK, devoted to perceiving dyshomeostatic DAMP-emitting ER perturbations (so far, no clear evidence for IRE-1 and ATF6 in this respect), may be regarded as a new family of non-classical PRMs, at least in a broader sense. In nonstressed conditions, the three sensors of the ER homeostasis are kept in an inactive state by the ER-luminal binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP). The protein BiP, also known as glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), is a member of the HSP70 family of proteins (specifically HSPA5). It functions as a chaperone to selectively bind unfolded proteins in the ER lumen by interacting with exposed hydrophobic 18 .6 Simplified scenario model illustrating the ER stress-induced three arms of the unfolded protein response. Perception of any perturbation of the ER is provided by three sensor molecules of the unfolded protein response embedded in the ER membrane: the PERK, IRE-1, and ATF6. PERK perceives dyshomeostatic DAMP (Subclass IIC-4 DAMP)-emitting ER perturbations (IRE1 and ATF6 still questionable). PERK phosphorylates eIF2a to up-regulate transcription factor ATF4 that induces the expression of transcription factor CHOP. IRE1a signals through its RNase via the splicing of XBP1 mRNA. The active transcription factor XBP1s translocates to the nucleus. ATF6 is exported from the ER to the Golgi complex to enter the nucleus as a potent transcription factor. Together, these transcription factors of the unfolded protein response determine the cell fate by the regulation of distinct subsets of target genes toward recovery of ER homeostasis and cell survival or the induction of regulated cell death in form of apoptosis and ferroptosis. In addition, the transcription factor ATF4 is differentially translated, up-regulating genes participating in autophagy and other homeostatic pathways. ATF activating transcription factor, CHOP cytidine-cytidine-adenosine-adenosine thymidine-enhancer-binding homologous protein, eIF2\u03b1 eukaryotic translational initiation factor 2\u03b1, ER endoplasmic reticulum, IRE1\u03b1 inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease 1\u03b1, PERK protein kinase-like eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 kinase, UPR unfolded protein response, XBP1 X-box binding protein 1. XBP1s, X-box binding protein 1 whereby the \"s\" stands for the spliced form of XBP1. Sources: Refs. [142, [153] [154] [155] [156] [157] [158] [159] [160] [161] residues on nascent peptides [151] . However, in conditions of ER stress, BiP is detached from these sensors allowing their activation to trigger pathways, collectively included in the term of UPR. This stress response acts as a corrective path, capable of both increasing the ER folding capacity and decreasing the incoming polypeptide load. Of note, this downstream pathway of each of the three UPR sensors appears to have an innate preference for a particular type of ER stress. Moreover, as reviewed [152] , upon dissociating from BiP, each of the three sensors modifies the ER to mitigate stress in its own unique way. For example, ATF6 is often the first sensor to respond to ER stress. Once ATF6 dissociates from BiP, it is translocated to the Golgi apparatus for cleavage. The cytosolic domain of ATF6 is then free to move to the nucleus, where it moderates increased expression of several proteins involved in lipid biosynthesis and chaperones. This allows an increase in the volume of the ER and provides more chaperone proteins to aid in folding, thus relieving some of the ER stress. The other two sensors, IRE-1 and PERK, remain as integral ER proteins but oligomerize and autophosphorylate following BiP disassociation (autophosphorylation, a type of post-translational modification of proteins (see Part VI, Sect. 24.3); typical for this biochemical process, a phosphate is added to a protein kinase by itself).",

            "text": "In molecular biology, splicing is a modification of an RNA after transcription in which introns are removed and exons are joined. Thus, an intron is any noncoding nucleotide sequence within a gene that is removed by RNA splicing during maturation of the final RNA product; an exon is any part of a gene that encodes a part of the final mature RNA produced by that gene after introns have been removed by RNA splicing. This process is needed for the typical eukaryotic messenger RNA before it can be used to produce a correct protein through translation. For many eukaryotic introns, splicing is done in a series of reactions catalyzed by the spliceosome, a complex of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), but there are also self-splicing introns. folding process is dependent on redox homeostasis, the oxidative stress can disrupt the protein folding mechanism and facilitate the production of misfolded proteins, causing further ER stress [163] . Moreover, this stress response functions as a productive source of DAMPs. Typically, HSPs and CALR, like other ER chaperones, can translocate to the cytosol and eventually to the surface of cells. Once exposed, these molecules can operate as Subclass IB-1 DAMPs to facilitate engulfment of antigens as mostly described in the context of induction of ICD [148, [164] [165] [166] [167] [168] . Via these mechanisms and by crosstalk with other molecular machines of the innate immune system including NLRP3 inflammasome activation via TXNIP (see Part IV, Sect. 13.4.6.3 and Part VI, Sect. 22.4.2.2) , the UPR may contribute to sterile inflammation and immunity (for articles, see Refs [153] [154] [155] [156] [157] [169] [170] [171] [172] ). Also, several signalling cascades triggered by the three sensors are apparently potent inducers of autophagy at a cellwide level that-as mentioned above-normally has an adaptive/protective function and consists of the three major types: chaperone-mediated, macro-and microautophagy. Interestingly, recent evidence has indicated that UPR-induced autophagic processes are capable of alleviating the UPR pointing to a crosstalk between these two innate immune defense mechanisms [173, 174] . Strikingly, a complex relationship reportedly exists between autophagy and DAMPs in cellular adaption to stress and injury and cell death characterized by a crosstalk between autophagy induction and secretion or release of DAMPs. In fact, growing evidence indicates that autophagic mechanisms are involved in regulating release and degradation of DAMPs including CALR, HMGB1, ATP, and DNA in several cell types [37, 148, 175] . This scenario may contribute to the observation that autophagy is also able to shape a supportive cellular immune response [176, 177] . This kind of innate immune interrelationships is, for example, involved in mechanisms of both reperfusion-mediated cell injury and ICD of cancer cells (see Refs [40, [178] [179] [180] [181] [182] [183] [184] [185] [186] [187] [188] [189] [190] ).",

While the precise pathways of apoptosis induced by ER stress are not known, the up-regulated PERK \u2192 eIF2\u03b1 \u2192 ATF4 \u2192 CHOP pathway plays an essential role by reversing translational arrest, increasing generation of ROS, and promoting calcium efflux from the ER.

Placed at the very beginning of defense processes of multicellular organisms upon injury, this stress response nicely reflects a hierarchy of DAMP emission (see Part IV, Chap. 16) . Striking is also the existence of an inter-organelle communication, for example, between UPR, inflammasome activation, and autophagic pathways which emerge as a homeostatic network determining the switch from adaptive life-saving programs to cell death under stress conditions, where specialized sentinels are localized at organelle membranes to induce the core apoptosis pathway. As briefly sketched in the next section, this innate immune defense response is not only directed against sterile stress but also against pathogen-mediated stress.",

In fact, the constitution of cellular stress responses is meanwhile regarded as the first line of defense against both viral and bacterial infection. However, the outcome is not always in favor of the host; the pathogen may also profit from this stress response, at least under certain circumstances.

            "text": "There are several mechanisms described of how a virus can induce ER stress. The central mechanisms of perturbation of the ER during virus infection can be seen in the production of large amounts of viral proteins by the virus concerned. Such accumulation of viral proteins in the ER implies a challenge to the protein folding machinery which may cause ER stress and, in turn, activate the UPR resulting in restoration of the ER homeostasis or apoptosis. So far, at least 36 viruses have been found to be able to induce ER stress and activate the three UPR stress signalling pathways [198] . Moreover, ER stress can be caused by viruses via other mechanisms, for example, as a result of ER membrane exploitation, imbalance of calcium concentration, or sabotage/depletion of the ER membrane during virion release. Viral infections may activate these pathways resulting in the inhibition or promotion of viral replication. For example, the PERK-mediated global translation shutdown is a very efficient antiviral mechanism, and a similar shutdown by PKR has been used in the interferon pathway to defend against viral infection [199] . Also, the virus-related UPR was found to trigger host inflammatory signalling cascade through innate immune signalling pathways that activate NF-\u03baB and AP-1 transcription factors as a result of chronic ER stress. In fact, overexpression of viral proteins in the ER has long been known to activate these transcription factors which induce expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 [200, 201] . Increasing evidence supports the notion that the UPR signalling synergistically interacts with virus-induced signalling to produce inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs. In addition, other lines of studies have shed light on a role of NOD1 and NOD2 receptors in transducing virus-related ER stress signals to elicit inflammation [197] . So far, however, a possible contribution of DAMPs to the promotion of these signalling pathways has not been investigated.",

In fact, manipulation of the UPR response has become an asset for many viruses to promote their translation, thereby leading to chronic ER stress. In other words, during infection, viruses are capable of hijacking the host translational machinery and fill the ER with viral proteins. For example, this is the case for many positive-strand RNA viruses, which house the virus replication machinery in the protective ER-membrane. In fact, viruses need host ER to produce increased quantities of viral proteins to continue replication.",

Thus, viruses were shown to manipulate the host UPR in various ways to stimulate protein synthesis capacity and to improve cell survival by inhibiting cellular apoptosis. In particular, the link between the UPR and autophagy are intensely discussed to be involved in this scenario. These two systems may act dependently, or the induction of one system may interfere with the other [202] . Thus, experimental studies could demonstrate that different viruses modulate these mechanisms to allow them to circumvent and bypass the host immune response or, worse, to exploit the host's defense to their advantage. According to current knowledge, RNA viruses including influenza virus, poliovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, HCV, and dengue virus were shown to regulate these processes. For example, recent studies on HCV-infected hepatocytes confirmed the evidence that virus-associated ER stress and UPR are linked to cellular autophagy. Thus, induction of the cellular autophagic response is reportedly required to improve survival of infected cells by inhibition of cellular apoptosis. Moreover, the autophagic response was demonstrated to inhibit the cellular innate antiviral program that usually inhibits virus replication. Nevertheless, as argued by the authors [194] , though HCV induces ER stress and autophagy, their cause-effect relationship is not clear.",

In fact, the list of human diseases that are pathogenetically associated with ER stress and activation of the UPR is steadily growing [204] [205] [206] . They include neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases, autoimmune disorders, and atherosclerosis. Given such an ever-increasing list of diseases, it is not a surprise that chemical compounds and inhibitors targeting the UPR signalling pathways with a high degree of specificity have been and will be further developed [207] [208] [209] .",

As already briefly touched in Part II, Sect. 5.2.6.4, two highly conserved multiprotein complexes, MRN and Ku, are considered the primary sensors of DSBs to subsequently activate ATM and DNA-PK [221, 227, 228] . In addition, ssDNA is sensed by the recognition molecule RPA that then, analogous to Ku, acts as a signalling and repair platform for downstream factors such as the PRP19, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in pre-mRNA splicing, and ATR kinase [229] . Other lines of studies have provided evidence suggesting that the protein PRP19 itself may act as the primary sensor of RPA-ssDNA to subsequently activate ATR [224] (Fig. 18.7) . In brief, upon DNA damage, DSBs are recognized by the MRN complex. Following recognition, MRN recruits ATM to this DNA lesion where it binds to the C-terminus of NBS1 as a component of MRN [230] . Following binding, ATM kinase is activated. However, the exact mechanism whereby MRN activates ATM is still not fully understood (discussed in [226] ). Recognition of DSBs is also realized by Ku70/80 heterodimer that has been shown to bind broken dsDNA ends preferentially [231] . It is the Ku70/80 then that recruits the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs) at the site of DSBs to form the DNA-PK holoenzyme. The major role of activated DNA-PK is to promote a peculiar DNA repair mechanism called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), a pathway that repairs double-strand breaks in DNA [231] . In fact, NHEJ repairs most DSBs in mammalian cells. As its name implies, NHEJ involves ligation of two broken DNA ends without needing a repair template [232] .",

In fact, first evidence suggests that ssDNA is initially sensed by RPA which then recruits and activates PRP19 [229] .

They are sensed by the DNA receptor cGAS and probably other as-yet-not-identified DNA receptors to activate STING-dependent pathways to promote defense pathways [235, 236] (compare Part II, Sect. 5.2.6; Part IV, Sect. 13.4.3; as well as Part VI, Sect. 22.3.7). As discussed by the authors [236] , it is conceivable that cytosolic DNA is released by dysfunctional mitochondria upon DNA damage or generated during repair of damaged genomic DNA. Moreover, as shown in studies on tumor models, the DDR-through the activation of STING-mediated pathways-induces the expression of another class of constitutive DAMPs which are exposed at the cell surface, namely, the MICs and different ULBPs [236] [237] [238] [239] [240] (compare Part IV, Sect. 12.3.3).",

In response to DNA damage, the three phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinases are recruited and activated. DNA-PKcs is recruited and activated by Ku-bound DSB ends; ATM is recruited and activated by DSBs through the MRN complex; ATR is recruited to RPA-coated ssDNA by its stable binding partner ATRIP. The cellular response to damage may involve activation of a cell cycle checkpoint, commencement of transcriptional programs, execution of DNA repair, or, when the damage is too severe, initiation of apoptosis. Upon sensing DNA damage, cell cycle checkpoints are activated to arrest cell cycle progression to allow time for repair before the damage is passed on to the cell.
