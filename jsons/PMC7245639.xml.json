However, in most cases (70%), these were nonspecific symptoms that did not include fever, cough, or respiratory problems. In the United Kingdom, where only symptomatic patients are tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, among 1,460,517 people being tested so far, as many as 1,234,054 (84.5%) tested negative [13]. Conversely, the prevalence of smell or taste impairment was rare in patients tested negative, thus showing that a new onset of altered sense of smell or taste has a high positive predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This makes it a very useful marker of infection where the capacity for testing is limited.",

This should be taken into account when estimating the burden of loss of sense of smell and taste during COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, due to the robust association between the loss of sense of smell or taste and the SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the possible existence of a monosymptomatic form of COVID-19 characterized by isolated smell or taste impairment, the new onset of these symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic should be considered a manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection until proven otherwise.",
