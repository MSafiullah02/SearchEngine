In keeping with this, gastrointestinal manifestations, such as diarrhoea and abdominal pain occurred in up to one-quarter of the COVID-19 patients, without cough. Overall about half of the COVID-19 patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal and respiratory specimen concomitantly. 2 The liver is enriched with innate immune cells (such as macrophages, natural killer, natural killer T, and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells) 3 and due to its rich blood supply from the small bowel, circulation of the virus via the hepatic reticular system is expected. Hepatic innate immunity populations are potent cytokine producers and there are reports that obesity and NAFLD were associated with increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1 by adipose cells and Kupffer cells. 4, 5 This may lead to increased likelihood of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and the high prevalence of NAFLD in our study populations. Further studies are required to enhance our understanding",

This finding is of potential added value to our observation that patients with COVID-19 had worse outcome if they had underlying NAFLD/MAFLD. Firstly, persistent liver injury observed in our patients was unlikely to be related to the direct cytopathic effects. Though ideally, one should compare hepatocyte expression of these 4 four genes in MAFLD subjects with COVID-19 and control subjects without COVID-19.",
