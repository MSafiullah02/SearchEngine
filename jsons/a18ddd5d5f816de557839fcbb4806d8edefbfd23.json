            "text": "T he RdRp is an essential protein encoded by all RNA viruses that replicate their genome via an RNA intermediate. All DNA and RNA polymerases share a similar structure, and RdRps are more similar to each other than to other polymerases. There are several crystal structures of RdRps available including those from poliovirus (PV); 1 Hepatitis C virus; 2 Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV); 3 bacteriophage u6 4 ; Foot and Mouth Disease Virus; 5 Bovine Viral Diarrhea Disease Virus; 6 Rhinovirus; 7 and Reovirus. 8 All adopt the typical polymerase structure of a right hand complete with fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains. Cocrystallization with nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) or with oligonucleotides of these enzymes has mapped substrate binding sites, while the binding of divalent cations, Mg 2\u00fe or Mn 2\u00fe , has been mapped to the catalytic sites. 3, 5, 6, 8 The active site is at the heart of the molecule, in the centre of the palm domain, and an additional domain, N-terminal to the fingers that anchors the tips of the fingers to the thumb is present in RdRps. 3, 6, 8 Beyond several conserved motifs there is little primary sequence conservation among the RdRps of the RNA viruses in general, or among those of the double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses. The catalytic site is normally characterized by a GDD motif, also known as motif C. [9] [10] [11] [12] In addition to the GDD motif, several other less obvious sequence motifs (A, B, and D-F) have been identified from diverse virus families on the basis of primary and secondary structure analysis. [9] [10] [11] [12] Bluetongue virus (BTV) has a 10-segment double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome and has been well characterized at a molecular and structural level. [13] [14] [15] It is a member of the Orbivirus genus in the family Reoviridae. VP1 is the largest BTV protein at 150 kDa, and is encoded by BTV RNA segment 1. BTV VP1 has been shown to be a processive viral RdRp, synthesizing dsRNA from a single stranded (ss) RNA template in the absence of other viral proteins, 16, 17 but there is currently no X-ray crystal structure data available for it. The RdRps of bacteriophage u6 (P2) and Reovirus (k3), for which detailed structural data are available, are potentially the most similar to VP1 as both viruses have segmented double stranded (ds) RNA genomes. The P2 protein of u6 is small at 664 amino acids in comparison with the 1302 amino acids of VP1. P2 acts both as a replicase and a transcriptase and is able to use both ssRNA and dsRNA as templates. 4, 18, 19 In contrast, there is currently no experimental evidence that VP1 is able to transcribe RNA from a doublestranded template in the absence of other viral proteins. It may be that the transcriptase activity of VP1 is dependent on the presence of another BTV protein, VP6, which is a helicase protein and has the ability to unwind the dsRNA prior to transcription. 20 Reovirus k3, which has a total of 1267 amino acids, is a similar size to BTV VP1. k3 has a centrally placed polymerase domain (PD) and large N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) which form a cage around the PD holding it rigid and preventing movement during the catalytic cycle. 8 The NTD covers one side of the active site, and anchors the fingertips to the thumb. It occupies a similar position to the NTDs found in other RdRps but is considerably larger. A cap recognition site has been located on the NTD of k3 which anchors the 5 0 end of the dsRNA template during RNA replication. 8 The CTD of k3 forms a bracelet structure with two tightly sealed circles. The opening in the centre of the bracelet forms the exit route for the nascent double stranded RNA. 8 BTV VP1 has two GDD motifs at positions 287-289, and 763-765. Only the latter GDD motif is surrounded by the other sequence motifs (A, B, and D-F) characteristic of polymerase proteins, 10, 11 which suggests that VP1 may have a single, central PD, similar to reovirus k3.",

            "text": "As protein modeling is dependent on a strong alignment to the sequence of a known structure, polymerase modeling is hampered by low sequence homology. Initially the BTV-10 VP1 sequence was submitted to the web-based server SAM T-02 in blocks of 500 amino acid residues. Submission of the central 500 amino acid residues of VP1 produced alignments with the RdRps of two positive sense ssRNA viruses, RHDV and PV. Subsequently PSIPRED 21 was used to predict the secondary structure of VP1, and then this prediction was compared to the secondary structure assignments obtained from the X-ray crystal structures of the RHDV and PV RdRps. Further alignment of motifs A-F and secondary structure was performed manually. The final polymerase sequence alignments ( Figures 1A and 1B) were submitted together to the program MODELLER, 23 to generate a spatially restrained three-dimensional model of the PD of VP1 ( Figure  2A) . The model has a typical polymerase structure and has the canonical structure of a right hand with ''fingers'' (blue), ''palm'' (red), and ''thumb'' (green). The ''fingers'' subdomain has three a helices (a-a,d,e; supplementary information) and four b strands (b-1,2,4,5 supplementary information). Generally most RdRps have eight a helices and five or more b strands, one of which is contributed by the NTD. 1, 3, [5] [6] [7] The modeled PD of VP1 might therefore be missing some alpha helical structure. Also, there is a region between the NTD model and the PD model (residues 374-580), which currently remains unmodeled as sequence homology in this region is too low for reliable alignment with known protein structures. Although it is possible that VP1 may have an area of unique structure adjacent to the ''fingers'' subdomain, it would be surprising if it was not possible to model the complete ''fingers'' subdomain as this structure is well conserved between polymerases. Another possibility is that the unmodeled region belongs to the NTD.",

The sequence motifs make up the highly conserved structure of the ''palm'' subdomain. The aspartate residues in motif C which are predicted to be responsible for divalent cation coordination are at positions 764 and 765 ( Figure 2B ).

Another possibility is that it is the point at which VP1 and VP3 interact, anchoring VP1 to the interior of the BTV subcore. The modeled CTD of VP1 has a bracelet structure like that of k3 ( Figure 3 ). In k3 this bracelet structure forms a pore through which the newly formed genomic dsRNA exits the polymerase. The model of the CTD has a RMSD value of 0.72 \u00c5 when compared with the corresponding region of reovirus k3, demonstrating a high degree of structural similarity. At the level of primary sequence 23.1% similar residues and 11.3% identical residues were shared by the two proteins ( Figure 4B ). The VP1 polymerase CTD has 20 a helices and 6 b strands as does the C-terminal region of k3. From our alignment and modeling data we believe that BTV VP1 and k3 have very close structural similarity in this region of the molecule and that the CTD of BTV VP1 forms an exit pore for the nascent dsRNA. The model of the VP1 CTD overlaps with part of the ''thumb'' subdomain of the VP1 PD such that the last two a-helices of the ''thumb'' subdomain are the first two a helices in the model of the CTD (Figure 3 ). Following these a helices there is an anti-parallel b sheet composed of two b strands followed by a short a helix which raises the possibility that the ''thumb'' subdomain modeled for VP1 actually has a total of four a-helices like many other polymerases.",

The parts of VP1 that could be modeled from this alignment were examined and the NTD and CTD domains were found to be similar to the models already obtained. The alignment suggested that the PD domain could also be modeled by aligning the sequence of VP1 with k3. The modeled regions that were obtainable from this alignment showed a polymerase-type structure similar to the model already obtained and similar to the PD of k3 (data not shown).

NTP binding was tested by incubating each VP1 domain with oxidized [a-32 P] CTP, as described in the Materials and Methods. To determine whether VP1 and the VP1 domains had covalently coupled CTP, the reaction products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. A strong 150-kDa radioactive band was detected when full-length VP1 was used in the reaction (Figure 8, lane 1 ). There were also additional smaller but weaker radioactive bands present which were probably due to nonspecific binding of CTP. Of the three VP1 domains only the 45-kDa PD fragment of VP1 was bound to the radiolabeled CTP ( Figure 8, lane 4) . The other two VP1 fragments did not produce any radiolabeled band at the correct positions in the gel indicating that these two VP1 fragments did not have NTP binding sites. In contrast, the PD fragment bound CTP very strongly and had a higher signal than that of the full-length VP1 when an equivalent amount of protein was used in each reaction. This result provides further evidence that GDD 763-765 in the PD is the catalytic site and not GDD 287-289 in the aminoterminal domain. It also indicates that a substantial amount of the soluble PD protein expressed in E.coli is correctly folded.",

The VP1 protein of BTV is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is responsible for the replication of the viral genome. Currently there is no structural information available for VP1. By manual alignment of BTV, Reovirus and other viral RdRps we have generated a model for the structure of VP1, the RdRp of BTV. The structure can be divided into three domains: an N-terminal domain, a C-terminal domain, and a central polymerase domain. Mutation of the putative catalytic site in the central polymerase domain by site-directed mutagenesis abrogated in vitro replicase activity. Each of the domains was expressed individually and subsequently partially purified to obtain direct evidence for the location of polymerase activity and the nucleoside triphosphate binding site. The nucleoside triphosphate binding site was located by showing that CTP only bound to the full-length protein or to the polymerase domain and not to either of the other two domains. None of the domains had catalytic activity when tested individually or in tandem but when all three domains were mixed together the RdRp activity was reconstituted. This is the first report of the reconstitution of a functional viral RdRp in vitro from individual domains. # 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers",
