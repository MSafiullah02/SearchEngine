Put simply, if R0 is greater than 1, there are more cases in the next disease generation, and an epidemic will occur. Thus, R0 is defined for an infectious agent in a particular population. In less formal settings, R0is sometimes thought of as an intrinsic property of an infectious agent.",

In Hong Kong, Vietnam, Thailand, Toronto, and Singapore, the first disease generation after the index case produced more than one secondary case, but in a few households, there were no secondary cases.4 Worldwide attention and infection control after the identification of initial cases probably reduced the number of cases per case in subsequent disease generations. Thus, the cumulative case data provide only very limited information about the intrinsic growth rate of SARS epidemics in the absence of control. In fact, cumulative case data reflect more information about subsequent disease generations, and little information about the index case. The proper conclusion from the cumulative case data for SARS is that the reproductive number R, a general term for the number of cases per case, has been near 1 over the course of an epidemic, including the generations before and after control. What was happening before control?",

However, conditions may change: transmission rates may be seasonal, the virus may mutate, or the efficacy of infection control may wane as people's fear subsides. Most seriously, if the number of active cases gets very large, it might limit the amount of resources that can be devoted to control, per case, and the epidemic may escape control. If we are lucky, control will succeed and we will never know how bad things might have been.",
