            "text": "Though it can be read as part of a much longer heritage of sociological thinking that has implicated anthropologists in long debates about \u2018social facts\u2019, the concept of ethnographic evidence is one that has only recently come into focus in anthropological theory.11 In his introduction to a special issue of the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute on the subject, Matthew Engelke draws on R.G. Collingwood\u2019s classic essay on historical evidence in asserting the disciplinary specificity of evidence. Yet, at the same time, he stressed, following Chandler et al., that \u2018in attending to the disciplinary specificity of evidentiary protocols, we need to be aware that evidence is defined not only by questions but also by competing pressures and regimes\u2019.12 In the case of plague during the third pandemic generally, but also on the Chinese-Russian frontier in particular, the questions asked of ethnography principally had to do with two aspects of plague: its epidemicity and its endemicity. At the time, questions regarding the epidemicity of a disease conventionally concerned aspects such as transmission pathways (airborne, waterborne, etc.) and virulence, as well as population and individual immunity to the disease: in other words, all aspects pertaining to the spread of disease amongst and between human and non-human populations. In the same epidemiological framework, questions of endemicity related to the disease\u2019s ability to persist in a given area via hosts functioning as reservoirs of the pathogen, and hosts functioning as in-betweens amongst different susceptible species. As we have seen in the course of this book, these dynamic notions were of the utmost importance to scientists trying to make sense of plague in the action of both studying and containing it, with the link between the endemic and epidemic states of the disease forming a key in problematisations of plague. As a result, the primary questions asked of ethnographic data concerned both plague\u2019s patterns of transmission from non-human animals to humans and amongst human subjects, and plague\u2019s patterns of persistence amongst non-human animal populations.",

This was an institutional antagonism between agents and agencies eager to \u2018possess\u2019 plague in all its symbolic efficacy.13 What was at stake in the course of this agonistic, imperial quest for plague was not simply the identification of the disease\u2019s epidemic and endemic patterns. Equally important was the configuration of these patterns in relation to specific biopolitical and geopolitical problems and opportunities in the regions under scrutiny and on a much larger, global imperial scale.",

            "text": "Why then ethnography? In what way did ethnography contribute to epidemiological reasoning regarding plague? What was it that made ethnographic data a desirable resource to which scientists would return, in their effort to provide answers to different questions, but also so as to raise new ones, about the disease? If, following Engelke, \u2018it is what we do with facts\u2014not only what questions we ask from them, but how we justify them to be \u201cfacts\u201d in the first place\u2014that makes ethnography important\u2019, then we need to ask how the evidential facticity of ethnographic data functioned within the wider epistemological conundrum of plague science at the time.14 In other words, how were ethnographic data configured or \u2018harnessed\u2019 as evidence about plague in relation to dynamic, and often conflicting, epistemological frameworks during the third pandemic?15 Following Carrithers\u2019s analysis of Raymond Firth\u2019s classic work on the Tikopia, Engelke argues that \u2018when human patterns emerge out of ethnographic ones, confirmed as such by a community of critical readers, and in a sense independent of the intentions of an author, they gain shape as ethnographic evidence\u2019.16 When approached critically, this emergent \u2018robustness and independence that confirms [the] reliability\u2019 of a given datum may, however, be read as a phantom objectivity that allows the former\u2019s application in the explanation of phenomena similar to or altogether different than those intended by its original collector or systematiser.17 We have already seen how in the course of the third pandemic ethnographic data collected on the Chinese-Russian frontier were rendered into such free-floating signifiers of plague, functioning as what Webb Keane has called \u2018portable objectifications\u2019.18 A prime example of this was the alimentary avoidance of marmot axillary glands on the part of Mongols.19 Whilst this was initially collected and published by Gustav Radde as an ethnographic datum unrelated to plague, it was later rendered into ethnographic evidence of plague amongst the aforementioned animals, and of the knowledge of the zoonotic source of the disease amongst indigenous groups in the region.",

            "text": "Of course, ethnography was not the sole source of such portable objectifications, but rather functioned within a much wider economy of evidence derived, amongst other disciplines, from photography, cartography, and bacteriology. This was, for example, the function of photomicrographic plates of plague bacteria, of nosological maps and climatological charts, as well as of clinical photographs portraying men, women, and children exposing axillary or cervical buboes in identical poses that functioned as prototypes of plague patients.20 The role of ethnographic data within this evidential economy was more pronounced in certain epidemic and biopolitical contexts, such as the one examined in this book, whilst less in others. In each of these contexts it operated in relation to other evidential regimes and within concrete medical and biopolitical conditions arising from the demographic character of the given outbreak as well as from the power relations in place between administrators, scientists, and the general population. Hence it would be altogether mistaken to analytically assert a universal function of ethnography as regards plague research, beyond the simple parameter that, in the context of the aforementioned phenomenon of epistemological entropy, it functioned as a potential anchor for epidemiological reasoning. What is more promising, analytically speaking, is to examine the transformation of ethnographic data into plague evidence in specific epidemiological contexts.",

            "text": "As we have seen in the course of this book, as regards the case of the plague research on the Chinese-Russian frontier the operation of configuring ethnographic data into epidemiological evidence was neither homogeneous nor underlined by a unitary research or interpretive culture. Different researchers took recourse to ethnographic data in different contexts with the aim to elucidate different epidemiological phenomena. In this process they rendered the former into evidence about a disease that itself had no stable identity but whose understanding changed as rapidly as new outbreaks stroked different parts of the globe. For Beliavsky, it appears that this was an operation influenced by the ethnological spirit of the great geographic expeditions of late Imperial Russia. In this sense, we can say that he wrote his short but important report in implicit dialogue with explorers such as Gustav Radde, who was the first to scientifically describe the animal identified by Beliavksy as the principal host of plague in the region. Writing twenty years later, Dudchenko seems to have operated under similar ideological conditions. Unlike the more cautious (or perhaps less ambitious) Beliavsky, however, he ventured not only to employ ethnographic data he collected in the field, but also to speculate about practices such as Buddhist pilgrimage. By contrast, for Matignon ethnographic data were part of a more specific interest in what we would today call ethnomedicine, but what for him was a mixture of useful traditional remedies and detrimental superstitions. His Urga expedition, his book on \u2018Chinese superstition\u2019, and the numerous pieces he wrote on various exotica attest to this interpretation. By comparison, Zabolotny appeared more reserved in his ethnographic descriptions, though he had ample opportunity to collect such data not only in Weichang but also in India, Arabia, and in other areas he visited as a prominent member of the Russian Plague Commission. As for Wu Liande, he initially sought to gather first-hand ethnographic data and relate them to plague in the context of a major epidemiological crisis, finding henceforth himself entangled, if we are allowed the Geertzean metaphor, in the \u2018webs of significance\u2019 he had spun.",

            "text": "Similarly, each of these paragons of plague research in the region had a different repertoire of concerns or questions about plague as a disease in relation to which he employed ethnographic data. Beliavsky\u2019s concern was immediate: to explain and contain the 1894 outbreak in Soktui. He does not appear to have written another piece on plague before or after this incident.21 His collection of ethnographic information on the disease hence seems to be solely concerned with supporting the tarbagan hypothesis, Beliavsky\u2019s revolutionary idea of a zoonotic origin of plague related to Siberian marmots. Matignon was similarly concerned with explaining a specific and limited outbreak of plague, which involved identifying its geographic origins and the means by which it was introduced or, in his terms, \u2018imported\u2019 into the region from South China. Zabolotny, working in the footsteps of Matignon, shared the same concerns, with the crucial difference that he turned his attention not to the importation of the pathogen but to its perseverance in the area under study. Hence if Matignon employed ethnographic data as evidence regarding plague\u2019s epidemicity, Zabolotny used such data to problematise the disease\u2019s endemicity. Dudchenko by turn took a more synthetic and adventurous approach in employing ethnographic data. He did this in the process of crafting his peculiar model of plague as an anthroponotic disease with a complex epidemic and endemic pattern, asserting that plague spread from humans to marmots and then back to humans via native pilgrimage and burial rites. Finally, Wu exhibited the most complex, if ultimately palinodic, employment of and engagement with ethnographic data. Initially, he took recourse to ethnography so as to defend the tarbagan origins of the first Manchurian plague epidemic (1910\u201311) and to explain the spread of the disease on the basis of an anthropological binary between skilled and knowledgeable native hunters and inept and ignorant migrant \u2018coolies\u2019. He then proceeded to employ newly collected ethnographic data (or, to be precise, the lack of such data) so as to challenge the tarbagan hypothesis, only to end up readopting the hitherto discredited native knowledge hypothesis on account of having to concede to the tarbagan hypothesis under the strain of new epidemics in the region.",

            "text": "We can thus say that in each of these cases ethnographic data were rendered into evidence about plague at strategic points of each researcher\u2019s epidemiological reasoning as regards the formulation of different hypotheses on the origins and trajectory of the disease. For Beliavsky, ethnographic data functioned as a support of his and Reshetnikov\u2019s pioneering tarbagan hypothesis; for Matignon, as an aid to his importation hypothesis; for Zabolotny, as accessories of his endemic theory; and for Dudchenko, as a bolster of his anthroponotic model. In these cases the employment of ethnographic data was an intelligent, if often misleading, attempt to stave epistemological uncertainty, and to bridge existing gaps in biomedical evidence as regards the areas or outbreaks under examination. Where the rendering of ethnographic data into evidence about plague assumed a qualitatively different epistemological function was in the case of Wu Liande. In this instance we do not simply have an operation of epistemological support or evidential patching up, but rather a meticulous engineering of ethnographic data into epidemiological evidence, which generated an outbreak narrative encompassing and often overdetermining several important aspects of the disease. In this case, ethnographic data were employed not simply to uphold a given process of epidemiological reasoning, or to provide a shortcut out of some evidential deadlock. Rather, they were rendered into epidemiological evidence in a manner that transformed and even challenged or negated biomedical evidence about the disease. This epistemological transformation was most evident in the case of Wu rejecting the tarbagan hypothesis largely on account of not being able to procure ethnographic data in support of it, an unprecedented act of epidemiological reasoning.",

            "text": "Conventionally, as Ann Kelly puts it, medical anthropologists are interested in \u2018practices, experiences and understandings that medical knowledge excludes\u2019.22 Instead my study has turned its analytical lens on practices and experiences included and framed by medical knowledge. \u2018Disease\u2019, claims David Arnold, \u2018was a potent factor in the European conceptualisation of indigenous society.\u201923 As discussed in the Introduction of this book, this was primarily done through a negative representational strategy that depicted indigenous groups as essentially pestilential societies. It was moreover an operation usually predicated upon a description of a given group as incapable of perceiving the key factors contributing to the spread of an infectious disease. These may, according to each case and narrative, include the source of the infection, practices contributing to its spread, or general (un)sanitary conditions that give rise to it in given contexts. It was a narrative most often focused on the supposed inability of a group to identify these patterns even in and amongst what, from a colonial perspective, formed its defining cultural, social, and economic practices. An example of this is evident in the description of a limited plague outbreak in Abu Ghraib in the autumn of 1875. Doctors from the Sanitary Administration of Baghdad who visited the so-called seat of the epidemic related that the disease had first struck the camels of nomadic Arabs who were camping in the area for pasturage. Rather than avoiding the afflicted animals, the said nomads proceeded to slaughter and eat the ill camels. As a result, forty of them fell sick and died, demonstrating fever and glandular swellings.24 This type of narrative fostered a critique of indigenous groups as societies of ignorance: societies unable to draw knowledge or even \u2018observation and common-sense inferences\u2019, to use Evans-Pritchard\u2019s famous phrase, from amongst their most fundamental hand-to-mouth, life-sustaining practices.25 This negative representational strategy reached its zenith in cases where entire ethnic groups were identified with a particular disease. The best-known example of this is the Fore of Papua New Guinea and their association with kuru. As Warwick Anderson has painstakingly demonstrated, this was a long-term operation of medical and anthropological identification of the Fore as a society suffering from an array of phenomena classified initially as culture-contact shock and hysteria, then as an unidentified syndrome, and finally as an infectious disease caused by a \u2018slow virus\u2019 that was identified as a prion.26 These consecutive problematisations of kuru led to two Nobel Prizes, but also to the progressive reduction of the Fore into \u2018a mobile archive of signs and numbers\u2019 related to the particular disease: \u2018the bodies of the Fore and their social life were reframed in terms of kuru, the territory was being reconstructed along the lines of kuru, the census of the Fore was a kuru census, and the map of the Fore was a kuru map.\u201927 Most recently similar representational strategies have been employed in the problematisation of what in current epidemiological practice are understood as \u2018emerging\u2019 zoonotic diseases, such as SARS and Ebola, often through the re-employment of the notion of \u2018cultural vectors\u2019, first developed in the 1980s by Paul Ewald.28 Cultural vectors refer to \u2018a set of characteristics that allow transmission from immobilized hosts to susceptible when at least one of the characteristics is some aspects of human cultures\u2019.29 What this model basically implies is that whilst a given host may be relatively non-mobile, a disease can still manifest itself in the form of enhanced virulence through socio-cultural practices.30 In the case of SARS, the 2003 pandemic of a respiratory disease hitherto unnoticed amongst humans, led to widespread accusatory practices targeted against South Chinese live animal markets. Described in scientific literature as well as in the daily press as the loci of SARS\u2019s spillover from civet cats to humans, these so-called \u2018wet markets\u2019 became central to the development of a new Yellow Peril discourse, which portrayed China and Chinese lifestyles as potential sources of \u2018the next pandemic\u2019; an all-encompassing contagion event that one day soon will supposedly threaten humanity with extinction.31 In the case of the recent Ebola outbreak (2014), what has come into the focus of both scientific and popular science discourses is the threat of infection posed by burials\u2014a theme, as already discussed, with a long colonial heritage. As discussed by Umberto Pellecchia, this isolation of burial practices as cultural vectors of Ebola in West Africa not only ignores the complexity of funerals as social phenomena, but has also contributed to overlooking crucial economic and political aspects of the crisis.32\n",

            "text": "By contrast, the cases examined in the course of this book comprise a seemingly affirmative strategy of representation\u2014a conceptualisation of indigenous groups on the Chinese-Russian frontier as societies-against-plague. Between 1894 and 1926 Mongols and Buryats were configured in medical and epidemiological literature as ethnographic subjects whose culture was largely a reaction to the menacing presence of plague in their physical environment. Key myths, rituals, and burial practices as well as modes of hunting were seen as little more than exotic cultural expressions of a baseline survival strategy against plague. Part of a naturalist ontological enclosure, this mode of representation is, nonetheless, distinct from what Byron Good has critiqued as anthropological strategies of interpreting cultural traits as \u2018unintended adaptive effects\u2019.33 Although in our case too culture is seen \u2018as a set of adaptive responses to diseases\u2019, the difference lies in the interpretative emphasis placed on native intentionality.34 Whereas the neofunctionalist ecological paradigm has focused on the net effect of adaptation, independent of and in the absence of intention on the part of the \u2018adapted\u2019, the epidemiological narrative examined in this book put emphasis on native intentionality as key to survival vis-\u00e0-vis plague. Mongols and Buryats were portrayed not simply as having \u2018adapted\u2019 to the conspicuous presence of plague in their environment, but also as able to articulate this cultural adaptation in a proto-scientific manner, explicitly attributing, for example, specific hunting practices to their desire to prevent zoonotic infection. In other words, they were seen as having developed not only cultural immunity to plague, but also a consciousness of this trait.",

            "text": "The point that we should not overlook here is that this mode of conceptualising native societies did not simply valorise their culture as epidemiologically aware or intentional. It also, subtly but I would claim pervasively, represented this culture as hopelessly irrational. For if these groups did realise that plague was present in their prey (marmots), and if they did understand the mode of transmission from marmot to humans (direct fluid contact), then an immediate question was raised: why instead of employing complex mythological and ritual apparatuses did they not simply wear leather gloves so as to prevent infection from the potentially ill animals? This query is only tacitly raised in medical literature, yet it always hovers between the lines, much like an example of what George Steinmetz has coined the \u2018epistemological unconscious\u2019, in plague ethnographies of the region.35 The conclusion the audience of this outbreak narrative is led to draw is that knowledge does not necessarily make up for the lack of reason, which was seen by plague researches as constitutive of native culture. Mongols and Buryats may know plague, in the sense that they understand its zoonotic source and mode of transmission, and they may even have developed an adaptive intentionality with regards to the disease, but they are unable to reason about it in a rational manner\u2014this is the intended lesson of the native knowledge hypothesis across its many variations. Hence, if this was a seemingly affirmative representational strategy, in that it praised native knowledge of plague, it nonetheless asserted an even more radical form of othering than its negative representational antipodes: indigenous groups could know or not know certain aspects of an infectious disease, but in either case they were incapable of reasoning about it rationally.",

            "text": "There is a crucial difference between the phenomenon I am trying to underline here and what Byron Good, following the much broader analytics of experience developed by Rodney Needham, has described as the pervasive juxtaposition between belief and knowledge in colonial medical narratives.36 An example of this juxtaposition as regards plague is evident in Baber\u2019s report on the disease in Yunnan, a region often considered as the origin of the third pandemic. Baber gives in his account a dry description of the disease that he claimed bore \u2018a resemblance to the plague of London described by Defoe\u2019, focusing on the progression of symptoms suffered by the victim: glandular pustules, weakness, aches, delirium, and pseudo-convalescence leading to death.37 This list of symptoms is no more precise than similar descriptions from the Middle Ages, and yet the idiom in place conjures up an aura of scientific objectivity. This image of \u2018knowledge\u2019 gives way to one of \u2018belief\u2019 when it comes to discussing Chinese understandings of the outbreak. Baber reported that, following the description of a French missionary, \u2018the native version includes all the above facts, but includes them in a cloud of superstitious accessories.\u201938 These consisted in the saturation of the sick room by demons: \u2018even the tables and mattresses writhe about and utter voices, and offer intelligible replies to any one who questions them.\u201939 The contrast here, in Good\u2019s analytical terms, is clear: on the one hand the epistemic clarity of a list of symptoms that somehow manage to count as knowledge, and on the other hand the superstitious haze of demonology. And yet, whereas the belief/knowledge dichotomy presumes that the indigenous group in question is eventually capable of knowing a disease in its immediate environment, the epidemiological reasoning I have examined institutes the imagined gap between the scientific ego and the non-scientific other as an unsurpassable ontological condition. For if all that natives lack is knowledge, then the gap in place is merely epistemological. And in that case one can always equip the former with \u2018scientific knowledge\u2019 through education, the assumption being that as evidence or \u2018proof\u2019 becomes available then they would shift from a mode of believing into a mode of knowing. This model of otherness then asserts an ontological continuum on the basis of which an epistemological paradigm shift (from them to us qua from past to present, in social evolutionary terms) can be achieved. In the case I have examined in this book, however, this \u2018progression\u2019 towards identity seems not to be an option. Instead Mongols and Buryats were presented as already (one is tempted to say always already) possessing knowledge of plague. More than that, they were presented as possessing this knowledge before scientists, and hence providing it to plague researchers. And yet, in spite of this empirical knowledge accumulated, the narrative goes, over centuries, native subjects still failed to reason about the disease in a rational way. Whereas in the case of the \u2018progression towards identity\u2019 model of otherness we have a classical dialectical operation, according to which the accumulation of quantity (knowledge) leads to a transformation of quality (reason), in the second case we are faced with an anti-dialectical cul-de-sac. Mongols and Buryats, though praised for their knowledge and for containing plague in the region, are nonetheless condemned to a static ontological condition: that of functional unreason.",

This was an apparatus of association between social forms of the native other and forms or processes of pathogeny, which found a plethora of biopolitical applications in the context of global epidemiology in the age of high colonialism. But it is also an apparatus that continues to inform our postcolonial world, and the problematisation of epidemics, from SARS in 2003 and the Haitian cholera outbreak in 2010 to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014. Whether seen as possessing traits of cultural immunity to or as being burdened by cultural vectors of infectious diseases, societies in the global south continue to be studied and evaluated in terms of their ability to survive, adapt to, and cope with what are usually described as pathogens arising out of or endemic to their natural or built environments. And at the same time, infectious diseases continue to be ethnographically configured, with scientists taking recourse to \u2018beliefs\u2019, \u2018folk-models\u2019, \u2018tradition\u2019, and, ultimately, \u2018culture\u2019 for their problematisation and understanding. These largely anthropologically redundant categories are more often than not treated as portable objectifications, so as to model, explain, and dramatise disease in the face of epistemological entropy forged by: the social, biological, and ecological complexity of infectious diseases, the irreducibility of multihostal zoonoses, and the syndemic entanglement of co-infection processes, economic inequality, environmental destruction, and structural violence. In this way, not only is the complexity of epidemic crises obscured, but, at the same time, \u2018behaviour change\u2019 becomes a \u2018pragmatic\u2019 priority over political-economic reform. Adopting a critical stance towards this approach to public health requires us to excavate the impact of colonial medicine and its epidemiological reasoning in the present predicament of global counter-epidemic interventions and global health as a whole. With the imperative of moving towards a relational understanding of disease in mind, and with the hindsight of the implications of the employment of ethnography in the understanding of plague in the course of the third pandemic, the historical and anthropological critique of epidemiology can become a key tool for forging a new critical epidemiology.40\n",

Roger Pollitzer\u2019s 1954 Plague, commissioned and published by the World Health Organisation, remains the latest and most commonly used general treatise on the disease today.For a critical discussion of these debates and their relevance to the anthropological notion of culture see Herbert (1991).M.

The question of gloves is raised in The Lancet after the rehabilitation of the tarbagan hypothesis, where the anonymous correspondent notes that \u2018hunters do not use gloves, their hands are often chipped, and during skinning operations the plague bacillus may readily gain entrance directly into the circulation through an open wound\u2019 (Anon 1924: 30).Good, Medicine, Rationality and Experience; R.
