Careful stratigraphical collecting showed that in each case there are complete series of transitions between the same four successive species, two of the ancestral Texanites, two of the successor Submortoniceras. Although the four species showed very high variability in both areas, there are small consistent differences between the same species in the two areas that are held to be of subspecific rank. It seems that the two populations were sufficiently isolated geographically to maintain these subspecific differences, but contact between them was enough to ensure that they evolved in parallel in specific and generic characters.",

The most recently discovered of these factors is a component of the brain and pituitary that causes proliferation of Schwann cells and astrocytes in vitro 14 \u2022 Brockes has now raised a monoclonal antibody against it, which will make it possible to purify and sequence it; and to discover what, if any, its function is in vivo. KNOWLEDGE of the Sun, our closest star, is based on observations of its surface properties. The temperature, magnetic field and constituents of the outer layers can be deduced by spectroscopy and, combining these data with estimates of size and mass, a model of the Sun's properties can be formulated. The model fils not only the observed surface properties but also predicts interior characteristics such as density and temperature. From these parameters and rates for the nuclear fusion reaction which converts hydrogen to helium and provides the energy output of the Sun the number of solar neutrinos associated with the nuclear burning may be readily found. An experimental verification of the standard solar model thus became possible. Unfortunately, as is well known, the experiment designed to detect these solar neutrinos failed to record the numbers predicted. An alternative way to probe the solar interior is by the detection of solar oscillations in a manner analogous to terrestrial seismology. The pressure waves associated with the oscillations, especially if of long period, penetrate deeply into the E solar interior and convey information about the internal structure. Here again observations and predictions from the standard model appear contradictory. Does this imply that the theory is incorrect or is it the interpretation of the observations that is at fault?",

Both groups measured the line of sight Doppler shifts of certain Fraunhofer absorption lines and, since observations were made on the integral solar disk, concluded that these observations corresponded to simple radial oscillations of the sun. The measured period of 160 minutes raised an immediate conflict with the standard solar model since if these were simple radial oscillations the longest period predictable was approximately 60 minutes. The Cambridge theorists 3 , however, pointed out that the observations could be interpreted in terms of more complex g mode oscillations.",

The stresses of an austral summer were amply rewarded by the results of an excellent experiment which resulted in 120 hours of uninterrupted observations. The preliminary analysis confirms the detailed structure and spacing found in the five-minute oscillation. However, those data relating to the longer periods do not show convincing evidence for the existence of a 160 minute oscillation. It is only when a superposed epoch analysis similar to that used by the Crimean and Stanford groups is used that the 160 minute period emerges. Admittedly the 24 hour modulation associated with daytime observation is no longer present in these data, but the earth does still rotate about its axis once every 24 hours, even at the pole. Hence any instrumental or atmospheric effects would have to be clearly eliminated.",
