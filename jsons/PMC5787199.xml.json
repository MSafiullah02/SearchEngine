Additional inclusion criteria included negative PCR tests on cerebrospinal fluid, whole blood, or both for the infectious agents caused by members of the species or genera Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, Ehrlichia canis, Ehrlichia ewingii, Anaplasma, Neorickettsia, Bartonella, and Rickettsia; the presence of multifocal T2\u2010weighted hyperintense lesions on MRI; and CSF pleocytosis with a nucleated cell count of greater than 5 cells/\u03bcL with greater than 50% mononuclear cells and a red blood cell count of less than 4,000 cells/\u03bcL.1 For cases in which a necropsy was performed, histopathologic confirmation of disease was accepted in the absence of infectious disease testing, MRI, and CSF. Because of the inflammatory nature of MUO, any potential subject to whom glucocorticoids were administered within two weeks of CSF or antemortem brain collection were excluded from this study; however, this criteria was not used for postmortem brain samples. Three animals in the diseased group and one animal in the control group received antimicrobials within several days of sample collection, which could have altered the results of the infectious disease testing. Animals in the control (non\u2010MUO) group were subject to the same age criteria as the diseased group (MUO). The control cases had a low index of suspicion of inflammatory disease based on a noninflammatory CSF analysis, inconsistent MRI findings, histologically confirmed non\u2010MUO disease process, or a combination of these findings.",

A majority of sequences lacked specificity to any single organism based on nucleotide and protein sequence analysis. This was because of either poor quality of the read, or sequences that were low complexity or highly conserved, and thus taxonomically ambiguous. This was the case for all eukaryotic organisms detected. A number of bacterial\u2010aligning reads were also detected; however, because of the range of bacterial species and the inconsistency of any given organism among samples, these were deemed environmental contaminants. The most common bacteria detected were Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus species. A low number of viral species were detected, but all that were present solely within MUO samples were bacteriophages, and therefore unlikely to be associated with disease.

We used an identical analysis pipeline for positive control samples, except we used different, appropriate genome assemblies for filtering host sequences. As expected, we detected python nidovirus, caprine herpesvirus 2, and WNV in the green tree python, mule deer, and crow, respectively, using our metagenomic sequencing approach (Table S2). We did not detect WNV in the experimentally infected robin brain,23 but confirmed that the sample was positive for WNV RNA by qRT\u2010PCR.36 We quantified the WNV copy number in the bird brain samples at 168 genome copies/\u03bcL RNA in the robin and 8.82 \u00d7 104 genome copies/\u03bcL RNA in the crow.36\n",

Future studies could benefit from more consistent use of antemortem image\u2010guided biopsies (only 1 of 11 of our MUO cases) and sampling of multiple sections of the CNS postmortem (only 4 of 11 MUO cases), as well as multiple time\u2010separated CSF sample collections.",

Strict inclusion criteria were used for antemortem diagnosis in this study. However, the lack of histopathology does not definitively rule out other disease processes, such as lymphoma. Therefore, it is possible that not all of the presumptively diagnosed MUO cases were GME, NME or NLE. Additionally, only two of the four cases evaluated by histopathology yielded a definitive diagnosis of GME or NME, whereas the other two were diagnosed as meningoencephalitis of undetermined subtype. The use of a greater number of cases with histologic confirmation could have strengthened the diagnostic certainty of each case and allowed for a more specific investigation of MUO based on histologic type.",

            "text": "There are also several possible technical reasons that could have prevented us from identifying an infectious agent underlying MUO. First, it might be that we lacked the necessary sensitivity. Although metagenomic sequencing can detect any pathogen, it is generally less sensitive than targeted methods such as PCR. The sensitivity of PCR is typically defined in absolute units (eg 100 genome copies in a quantitative PCR reaction), but the sensitivity of metagenomic sequencing is limited by read depth and the relative pathogen concentration. For example, if a metagenomic dataset contains 1 million unique sequences and if a pathogen's nucleic acid is present at a concentration lower than 1 part per million host nucleic acid molecules, then it is unlikely to be detected. The development and use of methods to deplete mammalian nucleic acids could have improved the sensitivity of our study by eliminating dog sequences and enriching for microorganismal nucleic acids. Our analysis of bird brain samples with high and low WNV copy numbers illustrates this sensitivity threshold. We detected WNV by sequencing in the crow brain, which had 8.82 \u00d7 104 viral RNA copies per microliter of RNA but did not detect WNV in the robin brain, which had 1.68 \u00d7 102 genome copies per microliter of RNA. It can, therefore, be deduced that our limit of detection lies somewhere between these values. This range is large, and the use of WNV\u2010positive samples with intermediate copy numbers could have allowed us to narrow this empirically determined limit of detection. Additionally, CSF has inherently low nucleic acid content because of the low number of nucleated cells present when compared to tissue. Therefore, DNA and RNA extraction generally have a low yield and further amplification is required for library preparation in these samples. Amplification can introduce base\u2010composition bias and increases the number of nonunique reads, contributing to reduced sequencing quality and read depth. Finally, it is also possible that the cause of MUO is an infectious agent so divergent from known pathogens that its sequence was unrecognizable. This is not likely, however. Eukaryotic and bacterial pathogens typically have characteristic conserved sequences that are easily recognizable (eg ribosomal RNA sequences), and viruses can typically be recognized by viral polymerase sequences, especially when compared at the protein level, as we did.",

There are several technical and biological reasons that could have prevented us from doing so. However, the thoroughness of our approach, our inclusion of internal positive controls, similar negative results from previous studies, and the clinical responsiveness to immunosuppressant therapy all provide support for the hypothesis that MUO is a primary autoimmune disease.",
