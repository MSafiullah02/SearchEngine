            "text": "There are 4 virus families known to cause viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in humans: Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, and Flaviviridae. While all VHFs can involve bleeding, hemorrhage is mostly a less common complication of severe infection. The general clinical picture for severe disease is one of grave multisystem syndrome with damage to the vascular system, and sometimes severe neurological symptoms,1 although many infections may also take a milder course. The natural reservoir hosts of these enveloped RNA viruses include a range of mammalian species, particularly rodents and bats. Most VHF viruses are transmitted to humans via direct contact with host body fluids or excreta, sometimes through an intermediate mammalian host. The Bunyaviridae and Flaviviridae VHF viruses are transmitted by insect vectors (ticks and mosquitoes). The CDC also now list 2 Paramyxoviridae (Hendra virus and Nipah virus) as VHF viruses. While they are not associated with hemorrhage many other aspects of the epidemiology and clinical presentation of these zoonotic viral infections show commonalities with the established VHFs.2\n",

            "text": "Several outbreaks of VHF in humans are recorded each year globally.3 With the glaring exception of the recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa, VHF outbreaks are typically small, limited to less than 100 patients. The median number of patients for the 17 previous EVD outbreaks is 65.4 Possibly due to the generally limited size of outbreaks, viruses associated with VHF have not been considered a priority for research funding. Consequently, existing diagnostics and therapeutics are limited, as is our understanding of the epidemiology, transmission, and animal reservoirs for some of these viruses. However, the recent EVD epidemic in West Africa has shown that VHF outbreaks can occur where least expected (eg, West Africa, whereas most previous outbreaks were in Central Africa)4, 5 and can rapidly spread out of control. As of February 28, 2016, the recent West African EVD outbreak had infected nearly 29 000 people, with more than 11 000 deaths.6 Fragile and under\u2010resourced health systems in these countries were sluggish in identifying the disease and were unable to respond rapidly and comprehensively enough to stop the spread of the disease.7 The situation was further compounded by an initially slow and uncoordinated international response that has been widely condemned.8, 9, 10, 11 The unprecedented magnitude of the West African EVD outbreak, along with the significant number of EVD survivors with persistent detectable virus in various body fluids (semen and ocular fluid) after recovering from the disease12, 13 and/or complications14 plus the discovery that large numbers of people with no history of VHF are seropositive for Ebola virus,15, 16 has challenged our previous notions of the acute nature of these viral infections of humans and called to question our previous low\u2010priority categorization of these infections with respect to research and health program funding. A retrospective study from Sierra Leone documented serological evidence for infection with a range of VHF viruses (including Ebola and Marburg) in 2% to 8% of patients using acute phase sera from Lassa virus negative febrile patients (collected October 2006\u20102008), suggesting that there could be Ebola and Marburg infections that are not characterized by rampant human\u2010to\u2010human transmission,17 similar to the established endemic nature of viruses like Dengue virus, Lassa virus, Hantavirus,18 and Rift Valley fever virus.19, 20 As of 2016 the EVD epidemic is no longer out of control, but flare\u2010ups continue: on March 17 Sierra Leone declared an end to a flare\u2010up that started in January, yet on the very same day, a new patient was confirmed in Guinea leading to 5 deaths as of March 24, 2016, prompting Liberia to close their shared border. This experience emphasizes the need to develop regional and national research networks to better understand the underlying causes of these outbreaks.",

Here, we review the Lujo VHF outbreak of 2008 in light of the lessons learnt from the recent EVD epidemic in West Africa and the current Zika virus (ZIKV) disease epidemic in the Americas and discuss the possible measures that could be taken by health authorities in Zambia and regionally, to efficiently integrate timely diagnosis of rare zoonotic diseases into existing health care, laboratory infrastructure, and human resource capacity development programmes.",

The index case was a white female aged 36 years who lived on a peri\u2010urban farm close to Zambia's capital, Lusaka. On September 2, she experienced a sudden onset of severe headache, myalgia, fever, and sore throat and self\u2010medicated with antipyretics and analgesics.23, 24 On September 4 she travelled by air to South Africa to attend a wedding on September 6, returning to Zambia on September 7 (day 5 of her illness), when she reported diarrhea and vomiting24 (reports diarrhea and vomiting on day 2). Her condition continued to worsen such that on day 7 of her illness she visited a private clinic in Lusaka complaining of severe chest pains, fever, rash, and sore throat for which she was given an assortment of medications (including antiemetic, antipyretic, analgesic, and broad spectrum antibiotics). The next 2 days, her condition rapidly degenerated as she experienced severe myalgias, facial swelling with central nervous system symptoms such as confusion and seizures. She was hospitalized on day 9 and evacuated the following day by air ambulance to a private hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa. On physical examination, the patient exhibited edema of the face and neck, rash, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, but no hemorrhage was observed. Clinical laboratory tests showed that she had elevated liver transaminases, thrombocytopenia, and granulocytosis. The observation of a possible tick bite lead to a tentative diagnosis of Rickettsiosis, and the patient received intravenous cefepime, clarithromycin, and linezolid, along with lactated Ringer's solution and dobutamine.24 Although intensive care treatment was instituted, together with hemodialysis and inotropic and vasopressor therapy, the patient's condition degenerated rapidly with hemodynamic collapse and death on day 13 of her illness. No postmortem was conducted.",

Patients 2 to 4 fell ill 9 to 13 days after probable exposure/contact with the index case, and all resulted in death. All 3 nosocomially transmitted patients were unwell for 10 to 13 days in the community before they were admitted and an epidemiological link with the index case established as well as VHF infection control measures implemented. Patient 3 was initiated on ribavirin on or around the same day that VHF was suspected in patient 2 (September 29 or 30, 2008). Patient 4 fell ill and sought care at her local clinic on September 27, but when seen as an outpatient at her local hospital 6 days later (3 days after the VHF alert and contact tracing commenced), she was initiated on therapy for tuberculosis (TB). She was admitted 2 days later, at which point the contact tracing team made contact with her, and she was referred to the teaching hospital for treatment.",

            "text": "The family Arenaviridae consists of 2 genera, Mammarenavirus and Reptarenavirus, which infect mammals and reptiles, respectively.25 Arenavirus particles are enveloped and spherical in shape and possess a bisegmented single\u2010stranded ambisense RNA genome comprising a large (L) and small (S) RNA segment, each contained within its own helical nucleocapsid.26 The L segment encodes a viral RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase and a smaller protein termed Z\u2010protein. The S segment encodes a viral nucleoprotein and viral glycoprotein precursor (Figure 2). Based on antigenic properties, geographical distribution, and phylogenetic analysis; mammalian arenaviruses are divided into 2 distinct groups: New World (NW) arenaviruses (Tacaribe serocomplex) and Old World (OW) arenaviruses (Lassa\u2010lymphocytic choriomeningitis serocomplex)25 (Figure 2). The NW arenaviruses that are known to infect humans include Jun\u00edn virus, Guanarito virus, Machupo virus, Sab\u00eca virus, and Chapare virus. Although LUJV is only the third OW arenavirus that is known to be pathogenic in humans, along with Lassa fever virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (Table 1), studies utilizing modern molecular tools including next generation sequencing technology are rapidly identifying new arenaviruses in rodent hosts.27 Epidemiologically, the assumption is that these viruses are generally well adapted to their rodent hosts, and those that might be pathogenic in humans cause only mild febrile illness, otherwise more arenaviruses would have been previously discovered. NW arenaviruses appear to be more commonly associated with human disease, possibly influenced by the use of different receptors28: OW arenaviruses such as Lassa fever virus use \u03b1\u2010dystroglycan (\u03b1DG) as a cellular receptor, which may be highly prevalent in the membranes of monocytes and dendritic cells,29 but the natural ligand of \u03b1DG, laminin, does not prevent virus infection in vitro and other candidate receptors (Axl, Tyro3, LSECtin and DC\u2010SIGN), including some shared with Ebola, have been shown in vitro to facilitate cell entry.30 The primary receptor for NW arenaviruses is transferin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is widely distributed and would facilitate a broad cell tropism,31 and there is in vitro evidence that even a single mutation can confer tropism to human cells.32\n",

There has hence been great concern that arenaviruses, with their established capacity to cause severe disease in humans, and their segmented RNA genomes could also give rise to novel species with pandemic potential. Recombinant mammarenaviruses have been produced in the laboratory for vaccine development purposes,36, 37 and reptarenaviruses are highly recombinant (due to the pet trade and the housing of diverse snake species in close proximity),38 but for wild\u2010type mammarenaviruses with their segmented genomes and overlapping host species, the evidence for reassorted or recombinant species of either NW or OW mammarenaviruses is weak.39, 40 The variable position of some OW arenaviruses on different branches, depending on which viral protein is analyzed, is suggestive of possible historical recombination events, but the branch lengths (Figure 2) and sequence identities (Table 2) suggest these events have been followed by significant divergence. When analyzing only a tiny fraction of the total number of quasi species in existence, more conserved regions might masquerade as evidence of recombination using some analysis tools.39 As indicated in Table 2, the viral nucleoprotein appears to be more conserved than the other 3 viral proteins.",

Taken together with previous surveillance studies that did not detect LUJV in 420 wild\u2010captured rodents,33, 34 it seems plausible to speculate that a rare and unlikely transmission event led to the infection of a human by LUJV. The environment around the farm would support other small mammal species (rabbits, genets, civets, etc.), but as arenaviruses seem to have coevolved with their rodent hosts, the phylogenetic evidence suggests that the natural host of LUJV should also be a rodent.35\n",

For this reason she had minimal contact with other people while she was ill. Also, human\u2010to\u2010human transmission of LUJV appears to occur in the late stages of the infection, maybe during the last 3 days before death,24 a likely smaller window of transmission compared with EVD.44 While the 2008 outbreak did not spread to urban populations, in a possible future scenario, an infected individual could travel to crowded urban centers, dramatically increasing the risk of uncontainable spread. At the private hospital involved in the LUJV outbreak, the level of awareness for possible VHF was low,24 and without intervention this is likely also to be the case at over\u2010crowded government clinics that serve poor communities in Lusaka. Health\u2010seeking behavior may involve visiting traditional healers that would also delay diagnosis, as documented in West Africa during the recent EVD epidemic.45 Zambia's high burden of human immunodeficiency virus/TB, malnutrition, and other diseases of poverty could also impact on the size and impact of a future outbreak. Taking all these factors into consideration, it would be dangerously complacent to think that the magnitude and spread of a potential future LUJV outbreak will be similar to that of 2008.",

A range of factors, both human (population demographics, health seeking behavior, burial practices, government response, etc.) and viral (pathogenicity and transmissibility of the specific virus strain) have probable impact on eventual outbreak size and impact, but molecular confirmation of the presence of a hemorrhagic fever virus is now the seminal event that gives local and international health officials the confirmation they need to mobilize a comprehensive infection control response.

History has shown that laboratories are high\u2010risk environments,49 and there needs to be a comprehensive plan and standard operation procedures in place, to ensure worker safety and outbreak prevention. VHF viruses are BSL\u20104 pathogens, but due to the cost of construction and maintenance, these facilities are available at just a few centers and are primarily required for infecting cell culture or culturing dangerous pathogens. For diagnosis in the field or at a national reference laboratory, the West African EVD outbreak has led to well\u2010established protocols for \u201crelatively\u201d safe collection of specimens and specimen handling for molecular diagnosis,50 with emphasis and training on appropriate personal protective equipment and specimen handling techniques. Importantly, these safety measures need to be applied to specimens collected from any contacts of the index case, before the specific etiological agent is confirmed. For known VHF pathogens there are more molecular diagnostic assays becoming available.48 WHO recently approved 6 new rapid diagnostic tests for EVD; 3 real\u2010time PCR tests, 2 immunochromatographic tests, and 1 multiplex PCR test.51 A modest stock of such diagnostics, including positive and negative controls, reordered on expiry, would cost little and could be embedded into ongoing training and skills development activities. In contrast to the traditional technology of cell culture, molecular techniques do not run the risk of amplifying infectious material.",
