Researchers around the globe have paused their work for several reasons. First, to avoid unnecessary burden on people who might be in distress during the pandemic. Second, because the context of the current research environment means that results will require cautious interpretation. Third, to ensure that continued recruitment of people to studies on self-harm and suicide when a global crisis is occurring is reasonable and safe; transferring face-to-face research online must be very carefully considered. Finally, because the supports and services that participants would be signposted to throughout a study might not able to provide support in the usual ways and formats.",

We have seen studies that do not provide sufficient information to enable fully informed consent, do not measure mood before or after participation, do not provide any signposting other than to potentially anxiety-provoking messages about COVID-19, and do not attempt any kind of mood mitigation or debrief to help to stabilise anyone that does become distressed after participation. We would recommend that researchers be mindful that general research into the impacts of COVID-19, even if this does not evaluate mental health, self-harm, or suicide, should be viewed as a highly sensitive topic, with similar attention to safeguards needed to protect the wellbeing of participants.",

Researchers should provide signposting and check that the services signposted to are operational and able to provide support (and in what format). Finally, providing mood mitigation to all participants is an important method to boost mood, particularly when participants have been asked to consider anxiety-provoking questions about COVID-19 and answer sensitive questions about self-harm or suicide. A number of methods including exam howlers,5 cute animal pictures,4 interactive websites,6 and so-called doodle pages7 have been shown to work for young people. The ethics of voucher lotteries and other incentives for participants in studies on suicide and self-harm have been questioned by lived experience authors.8 Valuing the time of participants who contribute to these studies and respecting the challenges of taking part in research on difficult topics is important at a time of financial difficulty for many, particularly when there is little access to supports.",

Clearly, ethics committees across the globe have a vital role to play in weighing these issues and in the context of a growing plethora of online studies. Given social distancing and lockdowns, an effective digital response is crucial. Clinical mental health services globally are having to mobilise staff digitally and remotely to meet current need.
