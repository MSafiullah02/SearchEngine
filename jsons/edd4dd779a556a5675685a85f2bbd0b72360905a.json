            "text": "The pandemic outbreak and rapid worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome 20 coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is not only a threat for humans, but potentially also for many 21 animals. Research has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses have been transmitted 22 from animals to humans and vice versa, and across animal species, and hence, attracted public 23 attention concerning host-virus interactions and transmission ways. Non-human primates (NHPs), 24 as our evolutionary closest relatives, are susceptible to human viruses, and a number of 25 pathogens are known to circulate between humans and NHPs. Here we generated global statistics 26 of virus infection in NHPs (VI-NHPs). In total, 121 NHP species from 14 families have been 27 reported to be infected by 139 DNA and RNA viruses from 23 virus families; 74.8 percent of 28 viruses in NHPs have also been found in humans, indicative of the high potential for cross 29 species transmission of these viruses. The top ten NHP species with high centrality in the 30 NHP-virus network are two apes (Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus), seven Old World monkeys 31 (Macaca mulatta, M. fascicularis, Papio cynocephalus, Lophocebus albigena, Chlorocebus 32 aethiops, Cercopithecus ascanius, C. nictitans) and a lemur (Propithecus diadema). Besides apes, 33 there is a high risk of virus circulation between humans and Old World monkeys, given the wide 34 distribution of many Old World monkey species and their frequent contact with humans. We 35 suggest epidemiological investigations in NHPs, specifically in Old World monkeys with close 36 contact to humans, and other effective measures to prevent this potential circular transmission. 37 38 39",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 43 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread worldwide, and recent studies suggest that pets and other animals 44 could also be infected by SARS-CoV-2 through natural contact [1, 2] . Captive rhesus macaques (M. 45 mulatta), inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 in pathological studies, exhibited a moderate infection as 46 observed in the majority of human cases [3, 4] . Besides captive animals and pets, wild animals are 47 also susceptible to the infection of coronaviruses transmitted from humans. For instance, in 2016, 48 wild chimpanzees in C\u00f4te d\u00b4Ivoire were infected by the human coronavirus OC43 [5] . 49 The close evolutionary relationship between humans and NHPs is thought to support pathogen 50 transmission [6] and many viruses have been described that circulate between humans and NHPs. 51 In captive and wild NHPs, various viruses including coronaviruses, enteroviruses, enteric 52 adenoviruses, rotaviruses, and picobirnaviruses have been detected, which are also found in 53 humans [7] [8] [9] . The most prominent cases of virus transmission from wild NHPs to human are 54 simian foamy virus (SFV), yellow fever virus (YFV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and human 55 immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [10] [11] [12] [13] . Conversely, viruses such as poliovirus and measles have 56 been reported in NHPs and likely derived from local human populations [14] . To block the 57 potential circular transmission route of different viruses between human and NHPs, precautions and 58 regulations are needed. 59",

Since 154 coronaviruses have been reported in macaques and other primates [7, 8] , viral surveys should 155 first target such species, not only to find known coronaviruses in such populations, but also to 156 find new strains with high zoonotic potential. 157 Experts in animal health and conservation are starting to urge for the protection of great 158 apes during human COVID-19 pandemics, since the transmission of the human virus to apes 159 could result in severe outbreaks and local extinctions [25] .

            "text": "689 [15]. Since each metrics presents 75 different and complementary aspects of centrality, we tested the correlations among all four 76 centrality indices. To obtain a clearer picture of the effect of centrality of each NHP species on 77 transmission ability, we obtained a composite centrality that integrates the different and 78 complementary aspects of the four centrality metrics by performing a principal component analysis 79 (PCA) on the centrality index correlations [13]. The phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) 80 methods were used to test the relationship between centrality and the number of viruses reported in 81 each NHP species, and the number of viruses in each NHP species that are also found in records of VI-NHPs were obtained from the GMPD. Forty-three additional 86 publications describing VI-NHPs, not included in GMPD, were integrated into the overall database. 87 Thus, our final dataset contained 1,478 records, describing infections caused by 139 different 88 viruses in 121 NHP species (14 families, 49 genera) globally (Figures 1a and 1b). The viruses 89 infecting NHPs covered DNA and RNA viruses from 23 families: Adenoviridae (20 viruses)(3), Orthomyxoviridae (3), Reoviridae (3), Poxviridae (2), Papillomaviridae (2), 93 Coronaviridae (2), Picobirnaviridae (1), Parvoviridae (1), Astroviridae (1), Hepadnaviridae (1), 94 Anelloviridae (1), and Arteriviridae (1) (Figure 1c). Among the 139 viruses reported in NHPs, 104 95 viruses (74.8%) were shared between human and NHPs, indicating the high zoonotic potential of 96 these viruses. 97 The most documented VI-NHPs occurred in the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes, 44 viruses; , but viruses were detected in all apes (chimpanzee, bonobo, gorillas and orangutans) and 99 94.4% of them have also been reported in humans. The second most documented VI-NHPs are 100 found in the rhesus macaque (43 viruses; Figure 1d), of which 33 are shared with humans. Besides 101 apes, Old World monkeys (Cercopithecidae) are with 70 (44.0%) infected species the most infected 102 group among NHPs. Among other NHP families infected species range from one to ten (a weighted unipartite NHP-virus network, in which each node represents a NHP 105 species connected to other nodes by the edges weighted by the number of shared viruses (Figure 106 2a).

This indicates that the centrality of a primate in the NHP-virus network could reflect 119 the level of potential risk of virus transmission between NHPs and humans (and among NHPs)areas containing many NHP species and species evolutionary closely related to 123 humans are more likely sources of zoonoses than areas containing fewer and more distantly 124 related species, it was hypothesized that forests of central and western Africa represent areas 125 where zoonotic outbreaks are likely to occur [17, 18]. Our study supports this hypothesis and 126 suggests that African Old World monkeys (P. cynocephalus, L. albigena, C. aethiops, C. ascanius, 127 and C. nictitans) exhibit a high potential for the circulation of viruses among NHPs and humans 128 based on the centrality evaluation of our NHP-virus network. Interestingly, based on our statistics, 129 the Asian rhesus macaque is the NHP species with the most reported virus infections. Rhesus 130 macaques are, besides humans, the world's most widely distributed primates, occupying a vast 131 geographic distribution spanning from Afghanistan to the Chinese shore of the Pacific Ocean and 132 south into Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam [19-22]. Furthermore, long-tailed macaques 133 (M. fascicularis) are distributed over large parts of the Southeast Asian mainland and the 134 Sundaland region between ca. 20\u00b0N and 10\u00b0S [23]. The network analyses shows the high 135 centrality of these two macaque species in the NHP-virus network and ranked them among the 136 top ten most central NHPs. Given the wide range of both macaque species, the centrality of 137 macaques in the NHP-virus network and the frequent interface with humans(Figure 3a and 3b),138    there is a high risk of virus circulation between humans and macaques. 139 A major drawback of our study might be uneven and incomplete data as only few wild NHP 140 populations have been thoroughly sampled. Since our statistics are based on documented 141 VI-NHPs, records on virus infections are likely to be more complete and extensive for 142 well-studied compared to less investigated NHP species. Centrality may also be affected by the 143 number of studies on each NHP species, because more thoroughly sampled NHP species seem to 144 have more confirmed virus infections[24]. However, there are also more interfaces between 145 thoroughly studied NHPs and humans, which might lead to a higher probability of potential 146 transmission. Thus, we did not control for the sampling effort in above analysis. For the sake of 147 preciseness, we used the number of citations (=number of studies) as an estimate of sampling 148 effort for each primate, including sampling effort in the computation of centrality estimates by 149 upweighting the least sampled primates and down-weighting the most sampled primates[13].150",

Based on the centrality evaluation of our NPH-virus network, 166several Old World monkeys are considered to be at great risk of cross-species transmission due to 167 the high centrality in the network. Since the distributions of Old World monkeys, apes, and 168 humans often overlap, monitoring and regulations ought to be issued to block this potential 169 circulative transmission route for the protection of NHPs. Especially macaques are widely used 170 animal models with large captive populations almost all over the world[28].Moreover, many 171 wild Old World monkey species are in close contact with humans in national parks and even in 172 urban districts (Figure 3a, 3b and 3c).
