Given that BCG is intradermally delivered, it mainly induces systemic immune responses that depend on T helper type1 (Th1) CD4 + T cell responses3,4. Because TB primarily establishes in the lung, vaccines that are capable of inducing respiratory mucosal immunity and pulmonary immune responses will confer better protection against pulmonary TB5,6",

Recently, two recombinant attenuated LI strains expressing the ESAT-6 or Ag85C protein of Mtb were constructed, and an antigen-specific CD8+ T cell-mediated immune response was obtained via intravenous vaccination17.

Investigating the ability of recombinant LI strains integrated with heterologous antigens to induce immune responses via intranasal vaccination is valuable in evaluating LI as a good antigen delivery vehicle for vaccines against respiratory tract infections. In this study, we evaluated the biosafety and immunogenicity of intranasal vaccination using two recombinant LI strains, LI\u0394actAplcB-Rv3875 (LI\u0394-Rv3875) and LI\u0394actAplcB-Rv0129c (LI\u0394-Rv0129c)17, to verify our hypothesis. We found that both strains induced lung-localized immune responses, including antigen-specific cellular immune responses and the secretion of secretory IgA (SIgA). To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the use of LI vector vaccines to induce promising lung-localized cellular and humoral immune responses by intranasal vaccination. Our research suggests that LI might be a novel and optimal live vector for respiratory mucosa vaccines.",

It is not surprising that both strains failed to induce antigen-specific cellular immunity in the spleen because they did not establish a durable infection in the spleen. As we reported previously, when LI invaded the lung via the respiratory tract, the typical infection lesions that resulted seemed isolated and densely packed18. This phenomenon can be attributed to the unique feature of ivanolysin O (ILO). ILO expressed by LI has 76~78% homology to listeriolysin O (LLO)19,20, the major virulent protein of LM that functions in lysing the phagosome21. However, research has shown that ILO is not as strong as LLO at destroying the double vacuolar membrane, thus resulting in most of the LI being degraded in the phagosome because it is difficult to escape from phagosome to infect adjacent cells22. Therefore, LI in the lung is nearly impossible to disseminate to other organs. Furthermore, the LI strain used in this study was attenuated by knocking out the actA and plcB genes, making it more likely to be restricted to the lung tissue. When developing a mucosal vaccine, safety should be the primary concern. There was a report regarding the withdrawal of an inactivated influenza virosome vaccine (NasalFlu) containing an Escherichia coli heat labile toxin adjuvant (ELT) because it caused facial nerve paralysis23. This case, together with other similar cases, reminds us of the importance of safety for vaccines. Our results showed that LI\u0394-Rv3875 and LI\u0394-Rv0129c were mostly restricted to the lung and were eliminated at 10 dpi. Additionally, the histological damage in the lungs caused by the strains was slight and recovered by 5 dpi.",

After the boost, a strong increase in the level of lung cytokines including IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-17A, was observed. IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 orchestrate initial monocyte and granulocyte recruitment and promote the antimicrobial activities of macrophages, which are considered to play critical roles in controlling Mtb infection24. IL-17A is mainly produced by Th17 cells that differentiate from CD4+ T cells. It was indicated that mucosal delivery of the tuberculosis vaccine can switch Th1 cells to Th17 cells25. Several studies show that IL-17A correlates with protection against TB at an early stage, given that IL-17A is capable of recruiting neutrophils and monocytes to the site of granuloma formation26,27. Intranasal vaccination with BCG triggers Mtb-specific mucosal immune response orchestrated by IL-17A, and thus confers better protection against Mtb challenge5. In addition, IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells in the lung are able to increase the production of chemokines to recruit more IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4+ T cells and then restrict bacterial growth after Mtb challenge26. Taken together, IL-17 is helpful in controlling TB development. In the current study, the level of specific CD4+ IL-17A in lungs of mice that were primed by the strains was only significantly higher than in na\u00efve mice (Fig. 5e), but it was strongly enhanced by a subsequent booster. Both strains induced a significantly higher percentage of CD4+ IL-17A than the vector control after boost vaccination (Fig. 6d), indicating that Mtb-specific CD4+ IL-17A was elicited. Polyfunctional Th1 cells have been suggested to amplify the protection against Mtb infection28. Moreover, polyfunctional CD8+ T cells have been proposed as a marker of protective immunity against Mtb29. Previous findings indicated that the polyfunctional T cells located in the lung were more effective than those in the spleen in providing protection against Mtb aerosol challenge30. Our data showed that both strains generated a high frequency of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 double-positive CD8 T cells in the lung (Fig. 7). Our results showed that Th1/Th17 and CD8+ T cellular immune responses in the lung were elicited by the recombinant LI strains.",

Qiu et al. reported that intranasal vaccination with rLM\u0394actA prfA* induced increased levels of immunogen-specific SIgA at mucosal interfaces but poor systemic IgG31. White et al. reported that the anti-vaccinia virus antibody response was not detected in the serum of animals after aerosol vaccination with MVA85A32. SIgA is the predominant Ig type in mucosal vaccine immunity. It was demonstrated that IgA-deficient mice were more susceptible to BCG infection33. Additionally, the pIgR\u2212/\u2212 mice were more susceptible to mycobacterial infection compared with that of wild-type mice after Mtb infection34. These results reflect that SIgA plays an important role in protection against Mtb infection by blocking the entrance of bacilli into the lungs and modulating the pro-inflammatory response against Mtb infection33. The notable induction of pulmonary mucosal SIgA levels in this study suggests a promising immunogenicity of such LI-based Mtb delivery systems.",
