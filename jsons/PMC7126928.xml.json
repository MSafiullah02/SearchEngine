TGEV replicates both in the villous epithelial cells of the small intestine and in the lung cells of newborn piglets, resulting in a mortality of nearly 100% [2]. Protection of the newborn animals from TGEV infection requires the induction of secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) in milk, especially in colostrum [2]. Typically, IgA-producing plasma cells in the mammary gland of pregnant sows originate from the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) where they were activated by different antigenic components. Thus, antigen-specific colostral antibodies can be induced by oral vaccines with enteric tropism [3], [4].",

Study of the induction of protective immunity to TGEV has focused on the spike protein (S), because it is the major inducer of TGEV neutralizing antibodies [7], [8] and mediates binding of TGEV to its cellular receptor aminopeptitase N [9]. The relevant epitopes for neutralization were mapped to the N terminal domain of S protein, and four major antigenic sites (A to D) were identified independently by two groups [7], [10]. Sites C and A (using the nomenclature of Delmas et al.) are involved in the induction of neutralization antibodies [7] and stretches of continuous residues in each site were shown to be recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies [7], [10].",

In plasmid pCS154, expression of the chimeric 987P fimbriae is driven by the promoter for the tetracycline resistance gene tetA\n[20]. Seroagglutination determined a high and constant level of 987P fimbriation of S. typhimurium \u03c74550/pCS154 in the absence or presence of subminimal inhibitory concentrations of tetracycline (data not shown), suggesting that pCS154 mediated-fimbrial expression was constitutive and not regulated by a TetR repressor [38]. The immunogenicity of chimeric 987P fimbriae expressed by Salmonella crp cya vaccine strains was shown previously to be improved by constructing and using pCS155 which contains a synthetic DNA fragment encoding the nirB promoter inserted between the tetA promoter and the fasA gene of pCS154 [20]. In this study, a similar strategy was used to construct plasmids containing the pagC promoter. A 294-bp fragment of DNA encompassing the pagC promoter of S. typhimurium \u03c74550 was cloned by standard PCR. The amplified fragment was inserted between the tetA promoter and the fasA gene of pCS154, generating pCS165. Consequently, both pCS155 and pCS165 have two promoters driving the expression of chimeric 987P fimbriae. To construct expression plasmids carrying only the in vivo-inducible promoter nirB or pagC, the tetA promoter-containing Hind III fragments of pCS155 and pCS165 were deleted, resulting in pCS176 and pCS173, respectively.",

The expression of chimeric 987P fimbriae was studied in S. typhimurium \u03c74550 carrying plasmids pCS165, pCS173 or pCS176 using different growth conditions. The amounts of fimbriae isolated from the same numbers of bacteria were compared on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. To test activation of the nirB promoter in \u03c74550/pCS176, the bacteria were grown statically in a capped-flask to reduce the oxygen level in the culture [39]. The aerated culture expressed a low level of fimbriae which increased threefold when the bacteria were cultured statically in a capped-flask (Fig. 1\n, lanes 8\u20139). The pagC promoter in pCS165 or pCS173 were repressed by supplementing the bacterial culture medium with MgCl2. As the concentration of MgCl2 increased, the level of fimbrial expression decreased (Fig. 1, lanes 2\u20137). In LB media supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2, \u03c74550/pCS173 merely expressed fimbriae, while \u03c74550/pCS165 still expressed relatively high levels of fimbriae. This result was expected, since pCS165 can also drive fimbrial expression from its tetA promoter (Fig. 1). LB by itself contains approximately 0.23 mM Mg2+ (Difco, typical analysis sheets), thus, fimbrial expression might be even higher with bacteria grown under the Mg2+-limiting conditions (1 \u03bcM) shown to best signal the induction of PhoP-activated gene transcription [40]. Taken together, the data confirmed that fimbriae expression from the constructs with the pagC promoter are regulated by Mg2+ concentrations.",

However, the antibody titers were significantly higher in the mice immunized with \u03c74550/pCS165 or \u03c74550/pCS173 than those in mice immunized with \u03c74550/pCS154 or \u03c74550/pCS176 (Fig. 3A). No other comparison in antibody titers identified significant differences. Thus, the data indicated that use of the plasmids with the pagC promoter significantly enhanced the immunogenicity of the chimeric 987P fimbriae. To better characterize the type of T helper cell response, the serum anti-987P fimbriae IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses of the different mice groups were determined. In mice immunized with strains expressing the fimbriae from the pagC promoter (with or without the tetA promoter), the anti-987P fimbriae IgG response was dominated by the IgG2a subclass (Fig. 3B). In contrast, mice immunized with strains expressing the fimbriae from the tetA or nirB promoter alone had a significantly lower IgG2a response. Statistically significant higher levels of IgG2a were detected (P<0.05) in the mice immunized with strains expressing the fimbriae from the pagC promoter, whereas statistically significant higher levels of IgG1 were detected (P<0.05) in the mice immunized with strains expressing the fimbriae from the tetA promoter alone. This suggested that mice from the former immunization groups developed a better type 1 helper T-cell (Th1) response to the 987P fimbriae than mice from the latter group.",

The pagC promoter was particularly attractive, since it is activated in the environment of phagocytic vacuoles, after S. typhimurium is taken up by macrophages [41]. By genetically engineering asd\n+-stabilized plasmids expressing chimeric 987P fimbriae on S. typhimurium \u03c74550 cya crp asd under the control of the pagC promoter, the systemic and mucosal immune responses to the chimeric fimbriae was improved significantly, in comparison to a construct directing antigen expression from a constitutive tetA promoter or from the nirB promoter. Most importantly, and in addition to the finding that the pagC promoter was the most effective one for inducing anti-fimbriae antibodies, TGEV-neutralizing antibodies were induced only with S. typhimurium \u03c74550 constructs carrying this promoter for antigen expression. We had shown previously that chimeric fimbriae on S. typhimurium induced a better immune response when the fimbriae were expressed from a tandem promoter, where the in vivo-inducible nirB promoter was added to the constitutively-expressed tetA promoter (\u03c74550/pCS155) [20]. In this study, the new vaccine construct with the pagC promoter alone induces higher immune responses than the vaccine using the nirB promoter together with the tetA promoter [20]. Moreover, the immune response was improved by using a construct combining the pagC and tetA (\u03c74550/pCS165) promoters. Curiously, the consistent slight improvement in immune responses we observed with the pagC and tetA construct were statistically significant only for the TGEV C epitope, but not for the fimbrial antigen itself. Consistent with previous studies, the TGEV A epitope was not an effective immunogen for Balb/c mice [18], [20].",

This promoter is regulated through the PhoP/PhoQ two-component signal transduction system of Salmonella that senses environmental Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations [45], [46]. The pagC promoter is activated at relatively low concentrations of Mg2+, a condition which is found within Salmonella-containing vacuoles in macrophages [47], [48], [49]. As shown previously for single heterologous protein antigens [31], [45], it was demonstrated here that the pagC promoter can also drive 987P fimbrial expression in response to a low Mg2+ concentration, and thus activates 987P fimbriation in macrophages. In Salmonella, the pagC gene encodes an outer membrane protein which is essential for full bacterial virulence in Balb/c mice and is highly expressed in vivo. Thus, the observed induction of the neutralizing anti-TGEV immune response can most probably be attributed to the expression of large amounts of TGEV peptide antigen on the Salmonella and to the intracellular location of the bacteria in professional antigen-presenting cells.",

            "text": "Compared to other expression methods for heterologous antigen display on Salmonella vaccines, the 987P fimbrial display system has several advantages that favor its use. First, fimbriae are polymeric proteins which allow inserted foreign epitopes to be presented hundreds of times along fimbrial threads, which themselves are numbered in the hundreds on the bacterial surface. Second, because enteroadhesion of 987P fimbriae is essentially mediated by its minor subunit FasG [28], [54], the major subunit FasA can be genetically modified as a carrier molecule without affecting the enteroadhesive property of the fimbriae [19]. Having demonstrated previously that the FasA subunit can be used as a carrier of protective epitopes of TGEV [19] and that Salmonella vaccine strains can be genetically manipulated to express the chimeric fimbriae [20], we combined these approaches with the beneficial aspects of in vivo expression by the pagC promoter as a novel strategy for designing better vaccines. The developed system was found to be efficient, since anti-TGEV neutralizing antibodies were detected for the first time after oral administration of a Salmonella vector delivering a TGEV immunogen. Moreover, the observed high titers of mucosal and systemic anti-987P antibodies, as well as the high titers of anti-Salmonella antibodies (data not shown), demonstrated the benefits of our combined approach to develop a multivalent vaccine targeting simultaneously major enteropathogens. It will be of interest to test whether the system can be developed further to display protective epitopes derived from other swine pathogens, such as rotavirus and foot-and-mouth disease virus. Most importantly, future studies will have to be undertaken in the pig to confirm our findings in the relevant host.",
