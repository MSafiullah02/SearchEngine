Conversations can center the needs of the community partner and revisit shared partnership aims in order to develop a mutually beneficial strategy. Researchers can inquiry about resource needs (e.g., materials, social, and individuals) or needs related to data collection in order to document how HIV-related needs are exacerbated (or curtailed) and/or the short and long-term ecological impacts of COVID-19 on PLWHIV. Further, the nature of COVID-19 is dynamic and fast-changing, which may require frequent and systematic check-ins with community partners to reevaluate community needs and research directions. Such regular check-ins will also provide more opportunities for community partners to engage academic researchers in community- led initiatives.",

The rapid pace of developing information may be complicated for community partners to research and verify while simultaneously adjusting services for clients. Researchers, skilled in validating evidence, can provide this information to community agencies who may then disseminate via various social media platforms and online support groups. Such partnerships may maximize the penetration of evidence-based information by a source already deemed trustworthy by the client population.",

Cohosting virtual meetings, particularly for community partners who may not readily have access to such virtual meeting platforms is one example of creatively leveraging resources to augment information sharing. Facilitating university affiliative status for community partners and technologic and infrastructure support will allow community partners to utilize online resources in the delivery of services and reduce power differentials between academic and community partners that serve as barriers to true community-based work.",

We recommend that researchers communicate that there will need to be a period to acknowledge the challenges brought by the pandemic and adjust accordingly.

While engaging in research may not be the first priority of community partners or PLWHIV during a pandemic, providing them with an avenue to voice concerns, identify challenges to care continuum delivery, and inform future interventions fulfils our commitment to use engagement and investigation to provide sustainable tools at the community and policy levels.",
