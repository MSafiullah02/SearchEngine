            "text": "The family of picornaviruses has more than 200 known members, divided into six genera, and contains pathogens such as poliovirus, human rhinovirus (HRV), encephalornyocarditis virus, foot and mouth disease virus and hepatitis A virus (HAV).1, 2, 3, 4These viruses possess a positive single-stranded RNA genome whose translation in mammalian cells produces a large protein product. The co- and post-translational processing of this initial polyprotein relies on highly specific and organized cleavage by viral cysteine proteinases, which are attractive targets for development of therapeutic agents.4, 5Among these, the 3C cysteine proteinases have been the subject of extensive structural investigation, with crystal structures reported for HAV 3C,6, 7HRV 3C,[8]and poliovirus 3C proteins.[9]Analogous 3C proteinases have also been detected in human and avian coronaviruses.10, 11These essential viral enzymes are especially appealing as targets for pharmaceutical intervention because their unique active site geometry[1]makes them highly specific in their choice of substrates and cleavage sites that are absent in non-infected mammalian cells. In addition, the active site residues appear to be relatively invariant in rhinovirus, where large numbers of serotypes (>100) make vaccine development difficult.[12]\n",

Substrate recognition, by analogy to the chymotrypsin family, is believed to involve anti-parallel binding of the backbone of the peptide to the proteinase and the interaction of the side chains with the enzyme in several key subsites. Hydrogen-bonding between the carbonyl oxygen of the side chain of the P1 glutamine of the substrate (or peptidic inhibitor) and a histidine at the S1 subsite (His-191 in HAV 3C) is probably one of the key recognition events (1, 5\u20138). The wild type HAV 3C has 219 amino acids with a molecular weight of 24 kilodaltons and exists as an active monomer. For peptide substrates mimicking the 2B/2C junction of the large precursor polyprotein, the k\ncat of this enzyme is typically about 1.8 s\u22121 with a K\nm of 2.1 mM at a pH of 7.5.[5]\n",

Incorporation of hydrazino functionality into peptide backbones (azapeptides) is well-established for generation of proteinase inhibitors,24, 25including cysteine proteinases.[26]Recently such analogues have been shown to act as active site titrants for cysteine proteinase,[27]and certain symmetrical bis-hydrazides are extremely potent nanomolar inhibitors of cathepsin K, a cysteine proteinase involved in bone-remodeling.28, 29In one study on HRV 3C proteinase, an N-bromoacetyl azaglutamine dipeptide analogue 1 was shown to have an IC50 of approximately 48 nM and to be a time-dependent irreversible inactivator with a k\ninact/K\ni value >2500 M\u22121\n s\u22121.[22]However, in this case the inhibitory activity depends on the highly reactive bromoacetyl moiety, which is likely to react non-specifically with a variety of thiols present in mammalian cells. The amide character of sulfenamides and the use of aryl sulfenamides as amino acid protecting groups which are removable by thiols under acidic conditions (Scheme. 1\n),30, 31, 32suggested that such functionality could display sufficiently low intrinsic reactivity and still form a disulfide with the active site thiol (Cys-172) of HAV 3C cysteine proteinase. Thus sulfenamide azaglutamine analogues of type A and B, as well as sulfonamide derivatives C, were synthesized and investigated for inhibition of this enzyme. Although the sulfonamides C would not be expected to react with the active site cysteine, they have some potential to bind to active site residues, and they also provide a new sulfur-containing aza analogue motif for investigation. The haloacetyl azaglutamine analogues 2 and 3 were also prepared for comparison. In each case the side chain amide functionality bears two methyls since such groups are well-accepted by the HAV 3C enzyme and hinder interactions with possible reactive intermediates, especially at the P1 carbonyl site.13, 16, 33\n\n",

The required sulfonamides are readily available by deprotection of N-Boc-\u03b2-alanine dimethylamide[37]followed by reaction with the appropriate sulfonyl chloride. As expected, the condensation[36]with the bromoketone proceeds readily, and can be followed by hydrogenolysis to remove the Cbz group in quantitative yield and form the corresponding amino compounds 9 and 10. Studies on sequence recognition by HAV 3C proteinase using model peptides suggests that the P4 residue should be a hydrophobic amino acid such as l-leucine, and that the P2 and P3 residues can be l-alanine.[38]This idea is supported by inhibition of the enzyme at nanomolar levels by aldehyde and fluoromethylketone peptide analogues that have such sequences.13, 16Thus coupling of 9 or 10 to N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-alanine proceeds readily with ethyl chloroformate to generate the target tetrapeptide azaglutamine sulfonamide derivatives 11 and 12.",

Coupling of the free primary nitrogen with the tripeptide, N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-alanyl-l-alanine proceeds smoothly to give 15. Hydrogenolytic deprotection liberates the alkylated nitrogen, which then immediately reacts with o-nitrosulfenyl chloride to afford the target sulfenamide 16. During these transformations it became clear that in the azaglutamine series, compounds which have amide character at only one nitrogen are prone to facile decomposition and should be protected at the other basic nitrogen as quickly as possible. Disappointingly, 16 shows no significant inhibition (IC50>1 mM) of HAV 3C proteinase despite the presence of the P4-P1 backbone. Not only is there no detectable reaction with the inhibitor, but the level of competitive binding at the active site is also very low. Presumably the aromatic sulfenamide moiety is too bulky to be easily accommodated in the enzyme site which binds the P1\u2032 substrate residue. Other sulfenamides were prepared wherein the o-nitrophenyl group is replaced with methyl or trifluoroethyl, but these compounds display very poor stability, especially in water, and were not pursued further.",

However, these substances still give only modest levels of inhibition with IC50 values of 0.4 to 0.5 mM, with the exception of the tetrapeptide analogue 27, which has an initial IC50 of ca 100 \u03bcM. Electrospray mass spectrometry of the C24S HAV 3C enzyme inhibited with 27 for a prolonged period (\u22653 h) does show formation of an enzyme-nitrophenyl disulfide, with the protein molecular ion peak shifting to higher mass by 154\u00b11 units (\u2212H+C6H4NO2S). The relatively poor competition with substrate may again be due to unfavorable interactions of the aromatic portion of the inhibitor with the enzyme active site. Although the sulfenamide azapeptides are not as potent inhibitors of HAV 3C proteinase as the peptidic aldehydes13, 14, 15or fluoromethyl ketone,[16]they represent new structural types that are reasonably accessible and stable, and may be useful for inhibition of other cysteine proteinases. Although additional thiols were not added to assay mixtures in the present study, and there is a possibility of non-specific reaction of compounds B and C with free thiols in vivo, removal of o-nitrophenylsulfenyl groups by extraneous thiols generally requires harsh conditions that include strong acid (e.g. p-toluenesulfonic acid) with high concentrations of thiol.30, 31, 32Cell culture studies could help to determine whether such sulfenamide functionalities are likely to be benign and stable in vivo.",

            "text": "Peptidic halomethyl carbonyl compounds are potent inactivators of 3C proteinases, 16, 22, 23and as mentioned above, the bromoacetyl azaglutamine derivative 1 has been reported as an irreversible inhibitor of the HRV 3C enzyme.[22]The availability of precursors for aza analogues from our preceding work encouraged the construction of chloroacetyl and bromoacetyl azaglutamine derivatives 2 and 3, respectively (Scheme. 5\n). Thus reductive deprotection of 15 as in Scheme. 3, followed by immediate acylation with chloroacetyl chloride or bromoacetyl bromide affords the target compounds directly. As expected, both 2 and 3 show potent time-dependent irreversible inhibition of HAV 3C proteinase with rate constants k\nobs/[I] of 680 M\u22121\n s\u22121 and 870 M\u22121\n s\u22121, respectively. Electrospray mass spectrometry of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes show addition of 470 mass units to the molecular ion and suggest that in each case there is displacement of halogen by the active site thiol of Cys-172. This is in accord with the reaction of HAV 3C with a tetrapeptide fluoromethyl ketone which has been studied by NMR spectrometry,[16]as well as with the displacement of halogen from iodoacetyl peptides by the active site thiol.23, 40Our compounds are somewhat less active against the HAV 3C enzyme than 1 is with the HRV 3C proteinase (k\ninact/K\ni value>2500 M\u22121\n s\u22121).[22]The reasons for this are uncertain, but most likely reflect differences between the proximal subsite interactions (P1 and P2) between the two enzymes with their cognate inhibitors. Possibly the presence of two methyl groups in the glutamine analogue side chain also has some effect. Moreover, it is clear that recognition of the peptide moiety in inhibitors 2 and 3 is crucial because the inherently more reactive compound, N-iodoacetamide, has a second order rate constant for inactivation of only about 3.1 M\u22121\n s\u22121.[23]\n",

Although some show no binding (structural type A) or only weak initial inhibitory activity (structural types B and C) toward the hepatitis A virus 3C proteinase, the haloacetyl azaglutamine tetrapeptides 2 and 3 as well as the sulfenamide azaglutamine derivative 27 irreversibly react with the active site thiol (Cys-172). It is not unreasonable to expect that such substrate analogues may be more potent and useful for other types of cysteine proteinases. Current studies with other types of inhibitors of picornaviral proteinases will be reported shortly.",
