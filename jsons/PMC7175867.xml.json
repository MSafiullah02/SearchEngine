            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus, the pathogen causing COVID-19, infects its host cells by recognizing the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Lu et al. 2020). ACE2 is a trans-membrane protein located in the cells of the respiratory tract, lung, heart, arteries, veins, kidney and intestines (Hamming et al. 2004). In the pulmonary epithelium ACE2 acts as a vasodepressor, balancing the action of its counterpart the homologous enzyme ACE1 which acts as vasoconstrictor, and both enzymes form the oxygen-sensitive renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) (Hampl et al. 2015). In normoxia, the RAS system is regulated by the dynamic equilibrium between the expression of ACE1 and ACE2. However, under chronic hypoxia (O2 2% for 12 days) ACE1 is upregulated by the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) (a master regulator of the response to hypoxia) in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (hPASMC), while the expression of ACE2 is markedly decreased (Zhang et al. 2009). Similar results were obtained in rats (males, SD) exposed to conditions equivalent to 4,500 meters of altitude, which after 28 days showed increased levels of ACE1 and decreased expression of ACE2 in heart cells(Dang et al. 2020). These observations are highly relevant for the pathogenesis of COVID-19, since the level of expression of ACE2 in pulmonary epithelial cells has been demonstrated to be positively correlated with the rate of infection of the first SARS-CoV (Jia et al. 2005; Lu et al. 2020; Ren et al. 2020; Rothan and Byrareddy 2020). These studies clearly may suggest that high-altitude inhabitants (i.e., chronically exposed to hypoxic conditions) express reduced levels of ACE2 in their lungs (and other tissues). Thus, adaptation to high-altitude environment could render local inhabitants less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 virus penetration and consequently are protected from the development of the disease defining acute respiratory distress syndrome.",

            "text": "The Tibetan plateau, located on the north side of the Himalayas, has an average elevation of 4,000 meters (Wu 2001). Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, is located at an elevation of 3,500 masl. The road distance between Lhasa and Wuhan (the center of the COVID-19 epidemic) is 3,503 km. However, Lhasa and Wuhan are also connected by train, bus, and by air, which indicates that tourist and commercial exchange between these cities may be considerable (Tseten 2020). The impact of COVID-19 on the plateau region (of 9,000,000 inhabitants) has been drastically low compared to the rest of China (Lei et al. 2020). Indeed, only 134 confirmed cases were reported for the plateau region (Tibet, Qinghai and part of Sichuan) (Gelek 2020; World-Health-Organization 2020) (Fig. 1\nA). A representative cohort of 67 patients (only two imported cases) who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Sichuan reveals that 54% were completely asymptomatic (no cough, fever, or headache), and less than 10% of the patients presented fever. Nevertheless, 10% of the SARS-CoV-2 positive cohort developed severe medical condition, however, all of these patients fully recovered after treatment, resulting in no mortality. Moreover, 29% of all the patients were potential high-risk due to predisposition with chronic respiratory and/or cardiovascular disease at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis (Gelek 2020; World-Health-Organization 2020). Thus, it appears that both the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the general prevalence of infection in Tibet does not correspond to global trends.",

Indeed, a high-altitude environment is characterized by drastic changes in temperature between night and day, air dryness, and high levels of ultraviolet (UV) light radiation (United-States-Environmental-Protection-Agency 2017). In particular UV light radiation A (UVA) and B (UVB) is well known to be capable of producing alterations in the molecular bonds of the DNA and RNA, and thus UV radiation at high-altitude may act as a natural sanitizer (Andrade 2020; Zubieta-Calleja 2020a; Zubieta-Calleja and Zubieta-DeUrioste 2017). In relation to SARS-CoV-2, while complete disinfection cannot be achieved by UVA and UVB, these radiations should shorten the half-life of any given virus (Andrade 2020; Zubieta-Calleja 2020b). It is clear that, all together, these factors may dramatically reduce the \u201csurvival\u201d capacity of the virus at high-altitude, and therefore its virulence. Finally, due to the lower density of air and greater distance between molecules at high-altitude, the size of the airborne virus inoculum must be smaller than at sea level.",

Importantly both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 bind to ACE2 (Lu et al. 2020; Rothan and Byrareddy 2020; van Doremalen et al., 2020), and thus a putative decrease of ACE2 expression in pulmonary endothelia in high-altitude inhabitant could represent a physiological protective for the severe and often lethal pulmonary edema.",
