Its urban population increased from 17.6% in 1978 to 46.6% (about 620 million) in 2009 (Niu and Pan, 2010). The trend of rapid urbanization is expected to continue as urbanization is considered an \u201cengine\u201d of economic growth (Sha et al., 2006), and indeed \u201caccelerating urbanization\u201d has been set as a national policy for the years to come (12th Five-Year Plan, 2010). With the prosperity brought by rapid urbanization, however, come issues pertaining to public safety, health, and social equity in the urban areas that, until recently, have yet to receive the attention they deserve.",

Fire trucks had difficulty reaching the building due to narrow fire lanes, and the height of the building further hindered the rescue attempt. On August 8, 2010, a mudslide hit the densely populated town of Zhouqu County, Gansu Province in Northwest China (about 50,000 people in an area of 1.47 km2), and took more than 1400 lives.

In Shanghai, cumulative subsidence has been recorded at 2\u20133 m in the central areas, contributing to safety hazards from flooding and damage to the city's infrastructure, including roads, buildings, subway tunnels, and sewerage system (Chai et al., 2004).",

One such case is the disparity between urban and rural areas. Cities are quickly developing, while rural areas are developing more slowly, causing a gap in income. This income gap keeps increasing, leading to a vast migration from rural to urban areas. Such migration has caused loss of labor, lower domestic demands, and a weak market in the large rural areas (Sha et al., 2006). Additionally, owing to the longstanding household registration system of \u201cHukou,\u201d which classifies citizens into urban and rural residents, rural migrants to cities have reduced access to education, health care, and social security resources. On the other hand, urban residents are routinely relocated, despite their unwillingness to move, to allow for redevelopment in the center city, often without being well compensated (Tu and Shi, 2006).",

To sustain the life and well-being of its population, China has indisputably set economic growth as its first priority. However, the predominant emphasis on gross domestic product (GDP) growth (Sha et al., 2006) has contributed to a development pattern that focuses on short-term economic gains at the detriment of social equity and the environment. For instance, the legally required environmental impact assessments (EIAs) of many development projects are perfunctorily performed, or even bypassed, to ensure tangible GDP growth (Tu and Shi, 2006). Investment only in high-paced, high-density development may lead to more safety and health concerns if there is inadequate investment in public services, such as emergency responders, emergency management equipment, and public health monitoring programs.",

Yet, its centralized administrative system remains relatively unchanged (Tu and Shi, 2006).

Under this approach, experts from different disciplines work together with stakeholders and government officials to fuse their ideas and explore creative new solutions to these complex issues.

SHUES will adopt this approach to explore pathways toward urban sustainability, and with a program of research, education, and outreach, to contribute to the current efforts the country is making toward its goals.
