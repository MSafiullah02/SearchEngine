Since the reaction products often contain mixtures of multiple chemical species, subsequent analytical steps must be capable of separating and identifying the individual components. Electrophoresis, which relies on inducing detectable differences in migration behavior between charged species under the influence of an applied electric field, has proven to be a highly versatile analytical technique owing to a favorable combination of characteristics including relarecently, there has been considerable interest in adapting electrophoresis technology to miniaturized microfluidic formats with the aim of producing portable low-cost versions of conventional benchtop-scale instrumentation. Ultimately, it is envisioned that these efforts will enable electrophoresis to become an integral component of self-contained \"lab-on-a-chip\" devices capable of putting the power to perform a variety of sophisticated chemical, biological, and biomedical assays directly in the hands of those who need the information most.",

More diameter) provided more efficient heat dissipation and allowed higher electric fields to be applied while minimizing temperature nonuniformities arising from Joule heating effects. This helped make it possible to achieve faster analyte mobilities and shorter run times without sacrificing separation performance. In addition to these benefits, the capillary format inherently requires reduced sample and reagent quantities and offers a greater capacity for automation. Since capillary cross-sectional dimensions are on the same scale as typical microfluidic channels, it is not surprising that many miniaturization efforts have focused on direct scale-down of proven instruments. The use of ultra-narrow capillaries (typically 50-100 \u00b5m inner CE technologies. A number of different microscale implementations of this fundamental phenomenon have been explored in order to suit the requirements of specific analytes and applications, including adaptations of slab gel and capillary-based techniques as well as chromatographic methods [16, 30, 59, 61, 91, 106, 112, 146, 153, 175, 200, 206, 301, 342] .

When analytes are suspended in an ionic buffer environment at a specific pH, each species migrates with a different mobility allowing them to be resolved as distinct zones and separated on the basis of size and charge (Fig. 1a) . Depending on the substrate material used to construct the separation channel, surface charge effects may also induce a bulk electroosmotic flow component superimposed on the analytes' electrophoretic migration. This can be advantageous or detrimental to the separation depending on the relative magnitudes of electrophoretic and electroosmotic effects. Consequently, the ability to precisely control surface charge and buffer pH is critical to achieving optimal separation performance.",

The use of a sieving matrix is essential in the case of DNA, where the free draining molecular configuration adopted in free solution results in mobilities that are independent of fragment size. The gel matrix reintroduces a size dependence to the electrophoretic migration as analytes travel through the porous gel network, with smaller fragments experiencing less resistance and eluting faster (Fig. 1b) . Gel electrophoresis also offers advantages associated with decreased diffusional broadening of the separated zones and a reduction in electroosmotic flow due to adsorption of the gel matrix along the microchannel walls that neutralizes surface charges. The need to load or cast a viscous polymer gel into a small-diameter microchannel, however, can pose challenges.",

The observed widths of the migrating zones reflect contributions from a number of factors including diffusional broadening, the initial width of the injected sample plug, and the finite detection volume. Considering only the diffusional contribution, the quantities in (1) can be expressed in terms of mobility (i.e., the migration speed) and a diffusion coefficient (i.e., the rate of band broadening during electrophoretic migration) yielding the following equivalent expression for separation resolution [18, 188]",

D is a coefficient characterizing the rate of longitudinal zone broadening and is generally larger than the field-free diffusion coefficient. An important point to note from (3) is that resolution scales with separation length as R \u221d L , establishing a limit on the extent to which the length of a separation column can be reduced. Separation lengths can vary widely (millimeters to tens of centimeters) depending on the specific application, sample type, and resolution requirements. In cases where L cannot be reduced without adversely affecting performance, longer separation columns can be folded into spiral or serpentine geometries, often with specially designed turns to minimize dispersion (Fig. 4) . These designs permit a more compact arrangement on the chip surface (Table 1) . The process by which samples are injected into the separation channel is also important. Injection of a nonconcentrated and unfocused sample zone not only requires a long separation distance in order to distinguish each component, but the corresponding signal from each species may fall below the detectable range as the zones spread by diffusion. Injection of a concentrated and focused sample zone allows each component to be detected in a considerably shorter separation distance. A variety of schemes are possible, the majority of which involve a perpendicularly crossed channel geometry where analytes are electrokinetically transported across the separation channel after which the voltage is switched such that only the sample volume at the intersection is injected [71, 107, ",

Photopolymerization techniques have been used to precisely position gels inside microchannel networks by using a photomask to selectively illuminate the device with UV light after which the unpolymerized reagents can be easily removed. Noncrosslinked polyacrylamide gels (i.e., linear polyacrylamide; LPA) that form entangled networks at concentrations exceeding a critical threshold are also useful for electrophoretic separations and are replaceable. Since formation of this entanglement network is accompanied by an increase in viscosity, the pressure required to inject the gel matrix into the microseparation channel is one factor that limits the available range of polymer concentrations. Thermoreversible gels such as agarose (a polysaccharide) and Pluronic (an amphiphillic block copolymer) have also been investigated as a means to aid loading and allow for replacement of the sieving matrix.

Under sufficiently high magnification, it is even possible to observe the dynamics of individual DNA molecules as they migrate through the separation channel (Fig. 5) .

Characterization and control of EOF is less well studied in other substrate materials (e.g., plastics), but is an active area of ongoing research. 6 .

Double-stranded DNA separations are not performed under denaturing conditions and fragments can be labeled with intercalating dyes that do not require covalent attachment. Fragment sizes that can be separated extend from around 100 bases to the kilobase size range. DNA molecules in the 40-50 kilobase vicinity and longer are large enough to be directly observable using an optical microscope, enabling migration of individual molecules to be recorded.

            "text": "Recent advancements have resulted in the development of separation technologies offering capabilities beyond those found in adaptations of conventional electrophoresis techniques [180] (Table 7) . One notable example is the use of micro-and nanofabricated pillar arrays as separation matrix structures in place of polymer gels (Fig. 7a) . These post arrays can be easily mass produced using micromachining technology and possess inherently uniform monodisperse two-dimensional pore morphologies. By manipulating the size, shape, and spacing of the pillars, separation properties can be tuned to make them compatible with a wide range of samples and analyte sizes. In addition, since the sieving structures are prefabricated inside the microchannel, the gel loading process is eliminated. The detailed physics associated with collisions and interactions that occur between the migrating analytes and the array of obstacles are responsible for introducing size-dependent mobilities. The size of the nanostrucutred pillars is limited by the resolution of photolithographic patterning, typically in the vicinity of a few hundred nanometers. Consequently, these designs are most effective for separation of large analytes (e.g., kilobase sized DNA). Another class of micromachined sieving structures that have been employed for electrophoresis involves patterning of periodically spaced nanometer size gaps between the floor and ceiling of the separation channel (Fig. 7b) . Unlike pillars, the gaps are vertically spaced and can be fashioned relatively straightforwardly by controlled etching. The physics of DNA electrophoresis through these nanogap arrays can be described in terms of an entropic trapping mechanism whereby excursions into the nanogaps produce migration characterized by rapid hops between gaps, with larger fragments experiencing a higher probability of excursions into the nanogaps and thereby eluting faster than smaller ones. A novel and entirely different class of fabricated sieving structure consists of magnetic microspheres that become assembled into a packed matrix upon application of an external magnetic field (Fig. 7c) . Here, the pore network morphology depends on an interplay between the size and concentration of the particles and the separation channel geometry. This arrangement allows sieving matrices with tunable reproducible pore sizes to be formed in-situ, and the aggregated particle network can be instantaneously according to charge (e.g., using isoelectric focusing in a pH gradient), after which each constant-charge zone is separated according to size. Finally, applications involving separation of neutral or weakly charged analytes can be accomplished using MEKC techniques. dispersed once the magnetic field is removed. Another novel separation phenomenon of interest to miniaturized systems is surface electrophoresis of DNA. Here, size dependent mobility is induced via interactions between the substrate (typically silicon) and DNA chains adsorbed on its surface. In this way, surface electrophoresis can be used to perform size selective fractionation in the absence of conventional sieving gels. Finally, an intriguing adaptation of electrophoresis for separation of short oligonucleotide fragments has been demonstrated using an electric field imposed parallel to an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip [302] (Fig.  7d) . The DNA fragments to be separated are first electrokinetically collected at the base of the AFM cantilever, then released by a periodically reversing electric field applied between the cantilever and substrate. The DNA fragments display a size-dependent mobility as they migrate along the length of the AFM tip, and the inherently small dimensions allow very high electric fields to be applied with minimal Joule heating. By tuning the frequency at which the electric field is reversed, desired fragment sizes can be transferred from the tip to the surface of a substrate while slower moving fragments are driven back to the reservoir before reaching the tip.

            "text": "Considerable efforts have also been directed toward combining electrophoresis-based analysis with other operations to produce integrated lab-on-achip systems (Table 8) . Many genomic analysis applications, for example, involve using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to chemically amplify minute DNA samples to detectable levels prior to analysis. The PCR process involves repeatedly cycling a reagent mixture (template DNA, primers, dNTPs, a thermostable polymerase enzyme, and other buffering additives) through temperatures corresponding to denaturation of the doublestranded template (~95\u00b0C), annealing of single-stranded oligonucleotide primers at locations adjacent to the target region (~50-65\u00b0C), and enzyme The inherently high efficiency of this process, yielding an exponential increase in the number of copies with each cycle, has helped make PCR one of the key enabling technologies in molecular biology. Thus, it is not surprising that considerable efforts have been directed toward integrating PCR with electrophoretic separation of the amplified DNA fragments. Miniaturization of PCR is challenging, however, due to the potential for evaporation when minute volumes of aqueous reagents are repeatedly heated to temperatures in the vicinity of 95\u00b0C, and due to the potential for non-specific adsorption of reagents at the reactor walls in high surface to volume microchannels that can inhibit the reaction [158, 245, 275] . Examples of other operations integrated with microchip electrophoresis include cell lysis, sample purification, multi-dimensional separations, labeling, and hybridization. Progress has also been made toward incorporating multiple sample processing and analysis steps in a single microfluidic device, as demonstrated in a hybrid glass-silicon design developed in the Burns group capable of amplifying a 106 bp DNA target from a bacterial genomic template via an isothermal strand displacement amplification (SDA) process followed by gel electrophoresis with integrated photodetection of the fluorescently labeled reaction products [24]. Subsequent work has resulted in development of an ultra-compact 1.5 \u00d7 1.6 cm hybrid glass/silicon microfluidic chip capable of performing a PCR-RFLP assay for influenza A virus detection involving two sequential reactions followed by an electrophoretic separation [229] (Fig. 8a) . Most recently, the Mathies group has reported a multilayer glass/PDMS design capable of performing integrated Sanger cycle sequencing of DNA (a reaction requiring similar thermal cycling parameters as PCR) followed by product purification and electrophoretic separation in a 30-cm long folded channel [15] . Read lengths of 556 bases were achieved with 99% accuracy (Fig. 8b) .",

            "text": "Commercial DNA analysis systems based on microchip capillary electrophoresis technology have also appeared on the market (Table 9 ). For example, the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, the most widely used commercial chip-based DNA analysis device, is based on a Caliper LabChip design incorporating arrays of glass electrophoresis microchannels that can be loaded with a low viscosity gel-dye mixture. This system uses interchangeable electrophoresis chips that interface with a benchtop power supply and optical detection system. The Hitachi SV1100 Microchip CE system is based on a similar concept, but the electrophoresis microchips are constructed using PMMA. The BioMEMS-768 DNA sequencer from Network Biosystems/Shimadsu takes a slightly different approach by using microfabrication technology to construct arrays of hundreds of 40 cm long separation channels in 50 \u00d7 25 cm glass substrates to provide higher throughput and integration with conventional automated liquid handling systems. Considerable strides have been made since microfabricated electrophoresis devices were first developed in the early 1990s [194] . These advancements have been made possible through a combination of improvements in micromachining technology, sieving matrix materials, and instrumentasystems generally have yet to demonstrate benefits in cost or performance ventional benchtop-scale CE technology. Some of the challenges that remain to be addressed include reducing device size to the point where the enormous cost savings associated with photolithographic microfabrication miniaturized detection technology. Systematic fundamental studies are also important in order to provide a more complete understanding of the physics of electrophoresis in micro-and nanoscale environments. Future developments in these areas over the next few years are likely to lay the foundation for a new generation of rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive instrumentation",
