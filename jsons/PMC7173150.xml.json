By using refined methods, and taking advantage of immunofluorescence and immunocytochemical techniques, there are better prospects of elucidating the intial stages of AT etiopathogenesis. Recently, we showed that S. pyogenes microorganisms have a definite affinity for the epithelium covering lymphatic tissue [8]. Moreover, we showed that S. pyogenes colonies were remarkably increased in number in relation to other aerobic colonies on the tonsillar surfaces during an AT infection. It seems likely that the increase in S. pyogenes bacteria during infection was mainly due to the attachment of the bacteria to the surface epithelium, as has been suggested recently 4, 8, 9. Attachment of pathogenic bacteria to tonsillar epithelium could only be recognized during an on-going AT infection, but not among healthy carriers of S. pyogenes\n[8]. The first essential stage in the etiopathogenesis of AT must therefore be the penetration of the mucous film covering the palatine tonsils. Both \u03b1- and \u03b2-haemolytic streptococci possess the ability to penetrate mucous effusion material [10].",

Any factor hindering desquamation of these infected cells will increase the susceptibility to S. pyogenes infection. In our study we recognized only a few intracellular pathogens.

An important way of spreading appeared from the present SEM study. These bacteria divide in one plane and therefore often form diplococci and chains. We noted that long chains of coccus-formed bacteria encroached on several epithelial cells (Fig. 2A). Under healthy conditions, bacterial colonies on tonsillar surfaces appeared to \u2018respect\u2019 the cell borders [19], whereas during an AT infection this did not seem to be the rule. That the pathogenic S. pyogenes bacteria under healthy conditions are kept in check by non-pathogenic \u03b1-streptococci might well be the case, as was recently suggested [20]. The SEM studies in this paper showed that the coccal chains ended up in a bacterial colony consisting of variously sized bacteria (Fig. 2B).",

Whether the induction of an AT infection caused by S. pyogenes is due to local suppression of the acquired immune system, or to an inadequate innate immune system of the palatine tonsils (phagocytosis, lysozyme, complement activation, bacterial opsonization) requires further investigation. The present study did show, however, that attachment of S. pyogenes microorganisms to the surface epithelium of the palatine tonsils can definitely provoke an inflammatory reaction of the underlying tissues, apparently via cytokine release and/or complement activation [22].",
