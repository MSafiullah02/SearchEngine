Climate change, unprecedented population growth with accelerated rates of antimicrobial resistance, have resulted in both the emergence of novel pathogenic organisms and the re-emergence of infections that were once controlled. The consequences have led to an increased vulnerability to infectious diseases globally. The ability to rapidly monitor the spread of diseases is key for prevention, intervention and control, however several limitations exist for current surveillance systems and the capacity to cope with the rapid population growth and environmental changes. Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) is a new epidemiology tool that has potential to act as a complementary approach for current infectious disease surveillance systems and an early warning system for disease outbreaks. WBE postulates that through the analysis of population pooled wastewater, infectious disease and resistance spread, the emergence of new disease outbreak to the community level can be monitored comprehensively and in real-time. This manuscript provides critical overview of current infectious disease surveillance status, as well as it introduces WBE and its recent advancements. It also provides recommendations for further development required for WBE application as an effective tool for infectious disease surveillance.",

On the World Health Organisations (WHO) top 10 threats to global health in 2019, four on the list directly refer to infectious diseases: pandemic influenza, HIV, dengue and another for high-threat pathogens such as Ebola (World Health Organisation, 2019) . Emerging infectious diseases caused by novel pathogenic organisms are of notable concern, it was highlighted by WHO that since the 1970s, over 1500 new pathogens were discovered and nearly 40 new infectious diseases have been identified (World Health Organisation, 2018a) . Many of these have severely impacted communities, with several major outbreaks occurring within the last 20 years including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (2002) (2003) , Ebola (2014 Ebola ( -2016 , H1N1flu (swine flu) (2009) (2010) , Zika virus (2015 Zika virus ( -2016 and COVID-19 (2019 COVID-19 ( -2020 (World Health Organisation, 2020a) . Two others on this list are regarding the prevention and treatment of infectious disease, one being hesitation to vaccinate and the other the rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), both have been linked to the re-emergence of communicable diseases.",

Whilst antibiotics tends to be focused on in discussions of AMR, rising cases of both fungal and viral resistances still pose significant threats (Fisher et al., 2018) .

Disease monitoring (which is often disease specific), can vary significantly with country and will depend upon the resources and sophistication of the public health services and facilities available . The information collected can be provided to WHO, who have the authority to lead the global surveillance of infectious diseases. WHO have had an integral role in infectious disease surveillance, as well as leading international surveillance networks, e.g. influenza surveillance. They also provide international coordination of epidemic responses in diseases that pose significant public health risks. Examples of conventional routes to monitoring diseases are based upon existing resources, such as mortality and morbidity rates, prescription and hospital admission data. Whilst these are valuable source of information for surveillance purposes, they do suffer from bias, resource insensitivity and costs (Bauer, 2008) . Table 1 . Routes to assessing public health and infectious disease surveillance techniques with advantages and disadvantages Many of the current systems in place are forms of passive surveillance that have disadvantages. For example, in countries with less developed health services, morbidity might be higher than assumed due to people failing to report to a healthcare service due to lack of access. This combined with the fact that sometimes in epidemics the laboratory facilities can become easily overwhelmed -the consequence of such is that these cases are not reported. The 2009 swine flu epidemic caused by a H1N1 influenza virus spread rapidly to > 214 countries in the space of a few months. Whilst it was estimated that several million people were infected with over 18,400 confirmed laboratory deaths worldwide reported by August 2010 (World Health Organisation, 2010) , it is believed that this is a gross underestimation. Reported studies in the literature have estimated through modelling techniques that there could have been as many as 10-15 times this amount, with up to 203,000 respiratory deaths (Dawood et al., 2012; Simonsen et al., 2013) . Dawood et al. projected around 80% of these deaths occurring in Southeast Asia and Africa, the causes for underestimation have been attributed to poor reporting due to the overwhelming number of cases.

Furthermore, the surveillance system needs to have comprehensive data collection systems regarding emergence of new diseases and re-emergence of old diseases, the threat of imported diseases or pathogens, and the emergence of multidrug or pan-drug resistant organisms. It has also been highlighted in the literature that monitoring clinics and laboratories for informing on public health is not sufficient, and there should also be an aspect of environmental monitoring of potential hazards (Nsubuga et al., 2006) . Therefore, a surveillance technique that could also encompass environmental exposure would be invaluable in providing comprehensive exposure status and disease outcomes. A new surveillance technique utilising water fingerprinting is under the development to provide objective and comprehensive evaluation of both public and environmental health status in real-time.",

The concept is primarily based upon the extraction, detection and then subsequent analysis and interpretation of chemical and/or biological compounds. These compounds, often referred to as biomarkers, could be harmful chemicals such as food toxicants and/or specific human excretion products (e.g. metabolites or endogenously formed chemicals as a result of exposure to and/or disease) that can be linked to the community as they are held within geographically defined water catchment areas (watersheds) to which whole populations contribute. Water sources that can be analysed are any that fall within the urban areas' catchment, and can include surface waters, domestic water sources and wastewaters. The results can then be used to give information on the community itself and its health, or environmental exposure. Wastewater is a popular and critical medium used in water fingerprinting. Often referred to as wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), this technique can give an unbiased reflection on the community's health and lifestyle habits due to the rich source of biological and chemical information it contains .",

WBE postulates that endogenous and exogenous urinary human biomarkers identified and quantified in wastewater can give a reflection of the population's health in (near)-real time (Fig. 1) . Wastewater (untreated) is usually collected from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) as WWTPs serve communities located in well-defined geographical sewerage catchment areas. Usually, one WWTP serves a town or a city. Importantly, as a whole population contributes to wastewater collected by any WWTP, wastewater from this community can be considered as its pooled urine. Fig. 1 . Graphical representation of the wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) concept A critical consideration in WBE are wastewater flow rates which are key to account for due to the wide variations in influent flows (e.g. wet weather causing dilution). The consequence is of such that when reporting upon the presence of a compound, it is typical to report as the daily loads in wastewater (mg/day). Furthermore, to normalise and allow comparisons for cities in different geographic locations, with varying population size, the daily loads per capita may be reported instead (mg/day/1000 inhabitants). This process of back calculation of community-wide drug consumption or exposure to chemical factors can provide un-biased reflection of key aspects of public health. For example, the monitoring of pharmaceutical or illicit drugs in wastewater can detect subtle changes in trends in usage and consumption in a community. Furthermore, not only could spatial and temporal trends be established but such data could be monitored in real time, allowing deviations from usual trends to be spotted early. This offers several advantages over biomonitoring techniques which focus on small target groups due to expenses and logistical challenges such as ethical considerations, as WBE is done on a population-wide scale, the anonymity of individuals is maintained. Water fingerprinting can also offer more timely analysis than other traditional based public health approaches. This would allow public services to respond more rapidly and potential health interventions to be employed.",

Kasprzyk-Hordern Environment International 139 (2020) 105689 very simple and clearly offers attractive advantages for the monitoring of public health, there are some challenges to be considered. For example, not only are the levels of biomarkers far more dilute in wastewater, especially in comparison to urine, but the wastewater matrix itself provides a complex environment to work in (Daughton, 2012) . As previously mentioned, wastewater contains a diverse abundance of chemical and biological targets which can give incredibly detailed information about the population that contributes. However, a drawback to having such a large amount of information is in the successful extraction from the matrix itself and the subsequent analysis of specific targets can be difficult. Extraction methods such as solid phase extraction and immunoassay techniques along with sophisticated analytical tools such as advanced mass spectrometry have allowed for the analysis of a wide number of compounds (Petrie et al., 2014) . Recent developments in sensing approaches could enable measurements on site, which would allow the system to provide information on public health in real time . Estimation of population size. Another challenge associated with WBE is the problem posed by dynamic populations (e.g. population fluctuations due to tourism and commuters) . Typically the standard approach is for levels of certain endogenous biomarkers in humans, such as cortisol or cotinine, to be calculated as daily loads which have been normalised to the population. This enables inter-city comparison (Chen et al., 2014) . However, there are difficulties in estimating the population size of individual WWTP catchments. This can result in unaccounted for, unique population fluctuations that, whilst having negligible impact on the levels of biomarkers in large populations (> 100,000 people), they might contribute to higher uncertainties in smaller populations.",

These however can be influenced by the composition of wastewater. The other uncertainties associated with the technique briefly mentioned above with regards to sample collection and analytical variability amongst a couple of others, have all been extensively discussed in a number of reviews (Castiglioni et al., 2013; Ort et al., 2014 Ort et al., , 2010 .

Along with some of the limitations of WBE touched upon above, there are also certain criteria that must be fulfilled for a biomarker to be considered in WBE techniques. For example, the biomarker in question must mostly be excreted via urine and concentrations of the biomarker must be in ng L -1 for downstream detection of the biomarker in wastewater (Chen et al., 2014) . Another vital characteristic is that the biomarker needs to be stable, not only in the sewage system but also during the process of sampling and storage . Biomarkers also need to be unique to human metabolism and ideally the metabolism process involving the biomarker would be well understood. This ensures that the biomarker in question has only originated from human sources, as opposed to exogenous ones (potential contamination of animals in the sewage system or from microbes present in wastewater) (Daughton, 2012) . With regards to the sewage system, wastewater is home to an extensive range of complex microbial communities N. Sims and B. Kasprzyk-Hordern Environment International 139 (2020) 105689 Sims and B. Kasprzyk-Hordern Environment International 139 (2020) 105689 that are challenging to characterise and will vary geographically.

This is particularly in the case of RNA viruses, where higher nucleotide substitution rates can result in this rapid adaption and spreading in new host populations (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005) . The potential of wastewater to be used for viral surveillance has been well discussed in the literature (Barras, 2018; O'Brien and Xagoraraki, 2019; Wigginton et al., 2015) . Wastewater surveillance has already demonstrated promising results with the potential for retrospective prediction of disease outbreaks of hepatitis A and norovirus (Hellm\u00e9r et al., 2014) . Influenza in wastewater was also investigated during the H1N1 (swine) flu virus outbreak, whilst influenza A viruses were detected in sewage, the pandemic H1N1 virus was not detected (Heijnen and Medema, 2011) . Furthermore, environmental surveillance of polio in wastewater has been utilised since the 1980 s, years before when the term \"wastewater-based epidemiology\" was coined, with Finland (Hovi et al., 2012) Israel (Roberts, 2013) and Senegal (Ndiaye et al., 2014) all successfully analysing sewage samples in order to assess polio circulating within populations.

Composition of wastewater contains a diverse range of PCR inhibitors including fats, proteins and humic and fulvic acids, which can cause problems later during downstream processing during PCR. The availability of different commercial extraction kits for DNA/RNA has demonstrated sometimes variable efficiencies and consistencies when extracting from PCR inhibitor rich samples, including wastewater and sediments (Mumy and Findlay, 2004; Walden et al., 2017) . This results in challenges when making meaningful comparisons across different studies and in establishing spatial and temporal trends. However, advancements of molecular biology techniques offer new routes for the analysis of genetic material, including digital PCR (dPCR) and next generation sequencing techniques. In dPCR, the absolute quantification of target genes is calculated using Poisson distribution statistics via the partitioning of DNA/ RNA samples into tens and thousands of reaction wells. Due to this partitioning effect, PCR inhibitory substances have demonstrated to have less of an effect in environmental samples, including wastewater, when analysed via dPCR (Ra\u010dki et al., 2014) . Critical evaluation of dPCR and its suitability for certain sample types have been discussed by Salipante et al (Salipante and Jerome, 2020) .",

Some which could be sensitive to changes in the body and could be early indicators of disease. Whilst only a handful of proteins are currently utilised in clinics, it has been previously highlighted that this is not a limitation for WBE, as purposes here are not for diagnostic analysis (Daughton, 2018) . Urinary inflammation biomarkers that are indicative of inflammation include C-reactive proteins (CRP) and interleukins including IL-6 and IL-8, have been highlighted as promising candidates for use in WBE . Urinary CRP levels are routinely utilised in clinics and in human biomonitoring studies, e.g. to investigate renal function abnormalities within a population (Stuveling et al., 2003) .

Investigating ratios of parent compounds to respective metabolites or ratios between compound enantiomers in wastewater can inform on whether levels have originated from human excretion or from direct disposal of a pharmaceutical into the sewage system (Petrie et al., 2016) . Furthermore the availability of pharmacokinetics data and excretion rates can allow back calculation to the estimated amounts of a pharmaceutical that a population has ingested (Zuccato et al., 2008) . This ability to distinguish between prescribed, disposed and consumed is important as just because a pharmaceutical is prescribed does not necessarily mean it is used. Delayed prescribing is a strategy by which a general practitioner (GP) will make a prescription available but will ask the patient to delay from using in order to see if symptoms improve first. The initiative has been evidenced to successfully reduce antibiotic usage in a handful of countries, including New Zealand, Norway and England (Spurling et al., 2013) . The use of WBE could therefore give valuable insight into the amounts of antimicrobials a population has actually consumed. However, whilst the analysis of parent compounds to metabolites provides valuable community usage data, the analysis of antibiotic metabolites tends to be overlooked in wastewater analysis, with parent antibiotics typically focused on.",

For example the environmental conditions in sewers has been shown to potentially impact ARG abundance, including temperature, metal pollutants and changes in composition of microbial communities (Jiao et al., 2018; Novo et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2016) .",

With regards to pathogen monitoring in wastewater, population size will be important. It has been highlighted by WHO for the case of monitoring polio in wastewater that large populations may decrease sample sensitivity and therefore sampling from subgroups may be required (World Health Organisation, 2003) . As infectious diseases, such as polio, spread rapidly in urban areas, the sampling of subgroups might also provide faster interventions by public health authorities. However, sampling from smaller subgroups in cities could lead to stigmatism of vulnerable groups.",

However, any outbreak, regardless of geographic location are fragile situations. Thus, care must be taken in the reporting of diseases being investigated within a community and social understanding of the situations will be crucial. For example, fear-trigged behaviours have been attributed as one of the major contributing factors to the spread of Ebola in Western Africa (Shultz et al., 2016) . Stigmatism surrounding individuals infected with Ebola combined with a sense of distrust in health services and treatment centres resulted in efforts to hide cases. This exacerbated the Ebola spread, as there was a decreased chance of survival of those infected with home treatment and increased chances of infecting family members or carers which in turn could infect other members of the wider community.",

There is also a requirement for population-wide surveillance information to compliment current clinical data. WBE has demonstrated significant promise in providing information on community-wide exposure and health status comprehensively and in near real-time. The importance of effective surveillance has been highlighted recently with the case of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). On the 31st December 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause were detected in Wuhan City in China. Just a week later on the 7th January Chinese officials had reported a novel strain of the coronavirus (World Health Organisation, 2020b). Even with early intervention measures of quarantining cities in China and travel bans, by the 3rd March 2020 the number of confirmed cases were 90,892 across 73 countries with severe outbreaks occurring in South Korea, Iran and Italy (World Health Organisation, 2020c) . Along with the current routes of global surveillance for the virus, WBE, if implemented, could track spread of the virus and, if linked with effective response system, could help with management. However, in order to successfully apply WBE in infectious disease surveillance, rapid advancements are required to tackle some of key challenges. These include:",
