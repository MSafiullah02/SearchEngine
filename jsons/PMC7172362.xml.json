            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) belongs to the genus Arterivirus. Two different genotypes are currently known, the European one and the American one. Genetic similarity between both genotypes ranges from 50 to 70% depending on the open reading frame (ORF) examined (Meng et al., 1994). PRRSV genome is composed of nine ORFs of which ORF1a and 1b encode the viral polymerase, ORFs 2\u20136 encode envelope and membrane proteins (called GP2a, GP2b, GP3, GP4, GP5 and M, respectively) and ORF7 encodes the non-glycosylated viral nucleocapsid protein (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998, Wu et al., 2005). Among the envelope proteins, GP5 seems to be one of the key viral structures. It is thought that attachment and entry to the target cells is mediated by GP5 or GP5-M heterodimers (Snijder et al., 2003). In addition, the neutralisation epitope of PRRSV is located in the middle of the GP5 ectodomain (Gonin et al., 1999, Ostrowski et al., 2002, Plagemann, 2004a, Plagemann, 2004b).",

ORF5 heterogeneity was initially reported for American strains but nowadays is evident that European isolates are diverse as well (Forsberg et al., 2002, Mateu et al., 2003, Pesch et al., 2005, Pirzadeh et al., 1998). Genetic variability observed in ORF5 is consistent with the well known fact that RNA-polymerases of RNA viruses have a relatively poor fidelity (Castro et al., 2005) and with the notion that selective pressures act favouring viral variants better fitted for spread and persistence in the target hosts. As GP5 is exposed in the viral envelope, participates in viral attachment to cells and contains a neutralisation epitope, it is a potential target for these selective pressures. Interestingly, the adaptative sites in GP5 seem not to be restricted to the known B-epitopes but also to other regions (Hanada et al., 2005).",

Then, a correspondence analysis (CA) was done in order to determine trends in the variation of codon usage. A linear regression analysis was used to evaluate correlation between codon usage bias and nucleotide composition. p-Values lower than 0.05 were considered to be significant. To ascertain the possible significance of changes in codon usage, 10 sequences of genes highly expressed in pigs were also analysed.

For each nucleotide position the rate of mutation (percentage of strains having a different nucleotide) was calculated compared to LV. Also, for each codon the ratio between synonymous and non-synonymous mutations (S/NS) was determined. As an initial criterion, codons where at least 25% of the examined strains had a mutation and had an S/NS higher than 3 were considered as potentially negatively selected while ratios below 0.3 were potential points for positive selection. These thresholds were set arbitrarily. In the third step, the probability that n strains from a set of N sequences shared the same mutation was calculated. For this calculation it was assumed that each sequence was epidemiologically unrelated to the others. Considering the degeneracy of the genetic code, the probability of a synonymous mutation (Ps) for a given aminoacid at a given point was calculated as Ps = (codons coding the same aminoacid-1)/60. The probability of a non-synonymous mutation was 1-Ps. The probability that n unrelated sequences shared a mutated codon encoding the same aminoacid was calculated according to a binomial distribution.

When compared with the codon usage of other early European PRRSV strains, results were similar for glutamine, serine and proline while leucine was preferentially coded with TTG as did the most recent Spanish strains. Most frequent codons for these aminoacids in 2000\u20132005 sequences were similar to the codon usage in some highly expressed swine genes. These results can be interpreted as a sign of either a selection or an adaptation of PRRSV to the codon usage most adequate for an efficient replication in the pig host. Also, this adaptation can have other implications. Several authors (Cook et al., 2005, Kheyar et al., 2005) have shown that optimising codon usage of arterivirus genes to that of mammalian cells results in an increase of the levels of expression of viral genes as well as increases immunogenicity of viral proteins. In the present case, our results suggest that PRRSV is still adapting to the swine host. This should be taken into account when designing attenuated vaccines because adequate levels of expression of viral proteins are important to develop strong immune responses.",

In contrast, the negatively selected sites were concentrated in the last 100 aminoacids of GP5 (14/20 sites) for which no neutralising antibodies have been detected so far (Plagemann, 2004a, Plagemann, 2004b). These negatively selected sites clustered in three segments of the predicted GP5. The first two of these clusters (residues 73\u201389 and 108\u2013113) corresponded to predicted transmembrane regions while the function of the third segment is still unknown.

One was located at the start of the ectodomain (Asp-37) and the second was located at the known neutralisation epitope (Asp-53). This hypothetical GP5 would lose thus the glycosylation site at Asp-46. In contrast, positive selection in position 37 introduces a new glycosylation site. Previous studies suggested that the lack of this glycosylation at Asp-46 reduces virus infectivity and can be a marker of attenuation (Wissink et al., 2004). However, according to Pesch et al. (2005), glycosylation at position 46 can be found in three European-type attenuated vaccines of which only one also has a glycosylation at position 37. Several authors claimed that these additional glycosylation sites may serve to mask the key B-epitopes (Chen et al., 1998) although this has not been proven yet for PRRSV. The second fact that differentiates the hypothetical GP5 from that of LV was a lesser hydrophobic profile.

The hypothetical GP5 was BLASTed and the 10 closest non-Spanish matches were included in the alignment along with Lelystad virus GP5 (LV) and an European-type strain isolated in USA. Protein sequences are represented by its GenBank accession number followed by the country of origin (AT: Austria, DK: Denmark, IT: Italy, US: United States of America) and the year of isolation. Amino acids are presented with a one-letter code in the row corresponding to LV. (- - -) Discontinuous underlined: predicted signal peptide. (\u2014) Continuous underlined: predicted N-glycosylation sites. () Boxed segments: predicted transmembrane regions in the hypothetical GP5. () Negative selection sites. Positive selection sites are marked with the one-letter aminoacid code in the hypothetical GP5. Selection site: the last row shows whether or not the predicted selection sites were found in other non-Spanish European sequences. Dots (\u00b7) indicate negative selection site found in 11/11 non-Spanish European sequences. Aminoacid symbol (X) indicates positive selection site found in at least one non-Spanish European sequence. Encircled aminoacid symbol (\u00ae) indicates positive selection site found in \u22658/11 non-Spanish European sequences.
