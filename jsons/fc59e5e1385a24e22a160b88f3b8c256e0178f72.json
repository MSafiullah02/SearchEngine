Fingolimod was discontinued. Two days after admission, IL-6 was elevated at 23.6 pg/mL (normal <1.8), and inflammatory markers were higher (figures 2 and 3).

Some monoclonal antibodies, such as the anti-CD19 ocrelizumab and the anti-CD52 alemtuzumab, have cell depleting effects that last many months and are not reversible. In contrast, suspension of fingolimod results in a rapid return of sequestered lymphocytes to the peripheral circulation, likely reversing most of its immunosuppressive properties and allowing opportunity for intervention. The risk of \"rebound\" MS disease after fingolimod discontinuation is delayed 2-4 months and is probably mitigated by restarting the drug after COVID-19 recovery, as in our case.",

Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1phosphate receptor modulator that reduces the egress of lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid organs into the circulation and is associated with increased risk of infections, especially herpes viruses, in patients with MS. Our patient's ALC was low since initiation of fingolimod (0.25-0.39 x10 9 /L); although this may have increased her risk of COVID-19 infection or its complications, this degree of lymphopenia is characteristic of fingolimod effect and neither efficacy nor adverse events, including viral infections, are significantly correlated with peripheral lymphocyte count. It is also possible that suspension of fingolimod actually increased her risk of later developing CRS and ARDS, though this would require loss of immunosuppression over just a few days, shorter than typically seen with fingolimod discontinuation. The patient's ALC normalized earlier than expected with lymphocyte reconstitution seen after fingolimod discontinuation (usually4-8 weeks), which might have been related to the active infection (Ghadiri et al., 2017). Interestingly, fingolimod is currently under investigation as a potential treatment for COVID-19-associated ARDS (clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT04280588). COVID-19 severity and outcomes appear to be related to the degree and characteristics of the immune response to SARS-Cov-2. Patients who develop severe respiratory failure might have a dysregulated \"cytokine storm\" with high circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines that result in direct tissue injury, especially in the lungs. IL-6 is the primary cytokine involved in this inflammatory cascade and higher serum levels have been associated with worse outcomes. Early identification and treatment of CRS improves outcomes (Luo et al., 2020). Tocilizumab has been used in the treatment of CRS observed in patients with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies. Given the resemblance of the inflammatory response observed in patients with COVID-19, tocilizumab has been recommended for treatment of severe COVID-19 (Luo et al., 2020). Following administration of tocilizumab in the setting of CAR-T therapy, serum IL-6 levels may increase (Chen et al., 2016), presumably by prevention of the IL-6 receptor-mediated uptake of IL-6 into peripheral tissue (Nishimoto et al., 2008). Nishimoto et al found that as long as free tocilizumab was detectable, IL-6 receptors were saturated by tocilizumab and IL-6 signal was completely inhibited. A similar post-tocilizumab increase in serum IL-6, also observed in our patient, has been reported in other cases of COVID-19 (Luo et al., 2020) and may be associated with worse outcome but confirmatory data are needed. Interleukin-6 may be involved in MS pathogenesis by induction of IL-17 producing Tcells. The effects of acute lL-6 inhibition on MS disease activity are not clear. Evidence from the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model shows conflicting data regarding effects of anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies (Serada et al., 2016). Human data is limited to case reports with repeated treatment; one patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) developed MS during treatment with tocilizumab (Beauchemin et al., 2016),",
