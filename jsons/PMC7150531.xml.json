It would be prudent, therefore, to presume that every patient and attendant is a potential source of infection.Precautions need to extend way beyond the lockdown period and cannot stop even if the incidence curve of COVID19 flattens or falls.Precautions, tact, knowledge and security measures will be put to test as soon as the lockdown is lifted. There will be a massive patient overload and being prepared is the only answer in this situation.This document is a guidance note and not a compulsory protocol. Every institution/clinic can have a modified protocol to enhance protection.An institution/clinic can opt to remain closed for services as long as the regional law does not enforce the Essential Services Maintenance Act.\n",

            "text": "The following recommendations apply to sanitation [1, 13, 18\u201320] and logistics. The WHO [16, 21] and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India recommendations [18] are particularly useful in this regard.Physical barriers, such as glass or plastic windows panels, should be used to reduce exposure to the COVID19 virus. This approach can be implemented in areas where patients will first present: triage areas, the registration desk at the clinic or the emergency department.Guards at the gate should wear surgical masks and maintain hand hygiene. Conversation should be carried out from a distance of at least 1 m [21].Alternate seats can be strapped down the middle with string or tape to ensure distance seating.Waiting in a vehicle is safer than waiting in a clinic.Every ultrasound environment is different [1]. It is unlikely that ultrasound clinics have too many choices in ventilation/air conditioning. It is recommended that single unit air conditioning should be run in an \u201copen to outside air\u201d mode (vent open). Clinics will have to decide individually how best to facilitate maximum air change in routine practice. Aerosol generating procedures (AGP) are rare in daily ultrasound practice and should be handled by standard operating procedures by various guidelines [1, 2]. However such AGPs should not be attempted in an ultrasound clinic but in designated centers.All indoor areas such as entrance lobbies, corridors and staircases, escalators, elevators, security guard booths, office rooms, meeting rooms, pantries and cafeteria should be mopped with a 1% sodium hypochlorite solution or phenolic disinfectants. Annexure 1 shows details of how to prepare a 1% sodium hypochlorite solution and has been issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India [18]. Phenolic compounds are available as readymade house detergent products in the Indian market. The frequency of mopping will depend on the footfall. At 2\u20133 patients an hour, 2 h mopping is recommended. Mopping should also precede the start of work and should also be done after the last patient has departed. Cleaning should be started from cleaner areas and then proceed to dirtier areas. Cleaning staff must wear surgical masks, and heavy-duty gloves. Goggles are required only if there is risk of chemical or organic splash (WHO Rational and Appropriate use of PPE). Appropriate hand hygiene should be practiced.High contact surfaces such elevator buttons, handrails/handles and call buttons, escalator handrails, public counters, intercom systems, telephones, printers/scanners, and other office machines should be cleaned twice daily by mopping with a linen/absorbable cloth soaked in 1% sodium hypochlorite.Frequently touched areas like table tops, chairs, chair handles, pens, office files, registers, keyboards, mouse, mouse pad, tea/coffee dispensing machines etc. should specially be cleaned. These can be cleaned with 1% sodium hypochlorite or a sanitiser that contains at least 60\u201370% alcohol.Metallic surfaces like door handles, security locks and keys cannot be adequately cleaned with sodium hypochlorite and a 60\u201370% alcohol sanitiser can be used to wipe down these surfaces.Sanitising spray should not be used on potentially highly contaminated areas such as registration counters as it may create splashes that can further spread the virus. A wipe is more effective.Cleaning equipment should be rinsed in running water or hot water after use and left to dry.Hand sanitising stations should be installed near the entry and near high contact surfaces such as clinic registration counters.Toilet floors, toilet pots, toilet seats and lids, toilet sinks and toilet soap dispensers should be cleaned with 1% sodium hypochlorite or a phenolic detergent three to four times a day. Taps and metallic surfaces should be cleaned with a sanitiser containing 60\u201370% alcohol.Outdoor areas have less risk than indoor areas because of air currents and exposure to sunlight. Cleaning and disinfection efforts should be targeted to frequently touched surfaces such as tables and bench handles.Patient examination tables must be covered with sheets (and pillow covers if necessary) that must be changed after each patient. Linen may be disposable as per individual choice. Routine machine-washing with a regular detergent is adequate for non-disposable sheets and pillow covers. Mattresses and table edges must be sanitised using a sanitiser containing 60\u201370% alcohol if abundantly available or a 1% sodium hypochlorite solution.",

These should be disposed off in appropriate bins. Cloths may be laundered with standard machine-washing.Transducer and cord covers are too overpriced for general use. Makeshift covers like laparoscopy camera covers are difficult to source.
