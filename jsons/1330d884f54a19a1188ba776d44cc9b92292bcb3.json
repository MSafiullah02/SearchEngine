The countries that have experienced the highest COVID-19 burden so far, including China, South Korea, Japan, Italy, and Iran, are very different from sub-Saharan Africa and thus there is limited information on how co-infection with HIV will affect COVID-19 patients. Of note, risk factors for more serious illness and fatal outcomes include older age (over 60 years old) and co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes, or cancer, which are also prevalent in ageing HIV-infected patients. Therefore, it can be reasonably hypothesized that many people in Africa will be at high risk for COVID-19. As the pandemic expands in sub-Saharan Africa, it will be critical to determine whether COVID-19-associated disease severity and mortality will be increased in immunocompromised patients, especially those with uncontrolled HIV (high viral load or low CD4+ T-cell count).",

A randomized clinical trial of lopinavir/ritonavir, an HIV drug used extensively throughout Africa, conducted in China found no improvements in disease length, viral shedding, or 28-day mortality [9] . A small (n=36), non-randomized clinical trial that investigated the use of chloroquine/azithromycin reported that hydroxychloroquine was efficient in clearing viral nasopharyngeal carriages of SARS-CoV-2 in French patients with COVID-19 in only three to six days. However, the quality of evidence was low due to the small sample size, lack of clinical outcomes, and lack of randomization, and therefore the results of the study are not conclusive [11] . There remains an urgent need to conduct adequately-powered, randomized clinical trials to confirm chloroquine/azithromycin effectiveness for treatment of COVID-19.",
