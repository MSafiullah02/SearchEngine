            "text": "Upper-room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is a commonly used engineering control technology to reduce the likelihood of airborne disease transmission in congregate settings such as hospitals, homeless shelters, and prisons [1]. It is particularly well suited for control of tuberculosis (TB), which is spread from person to person exclusively by airborne transmission [2]. Other diseases that are believed, at least in part, to be transmitted through the airborne route can also potentially be controlled by upper-room UVGI (e.g., common cold [3], influenza [4], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [5], and smallpox [6]). In addition, upper-room UVGI can also reduce the concentration of airborne Bacillus anthracis spores, an infectious agent that has been used by terrorists [7].",

In order to minimize UV radiation reaching the lower room where it is potentially hazardous to occupants, the fixtures utilize horizontal, closely spaced, deep louvers to collimate the UV beam and cause it to rise about three to five degrees from the horizontal. A concern with upper-room UVGI arises because the UV beam remains in the upper room and an infected person exhales infectious particles into the lower room. Thus, sufficient vertical air mixing is crucial for bringing infectious particles to the upper room where they are irradiated and inactivated and then returning the air to the lower room where it can be safely breathed by non-infected people. Recognizing that natural convection may not always provide a dependable source of vertical air mixing, NIOSH recommends the use of ceiling fans as a means to assure that vertical air mixing is adequate [8].",

In addition to quantifying how much mixing is required for upper-room UVGI to be efficacious, this work was also designed to provide other researchers engaged in modeling upper-room UVGI using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), or other methods, with experimental data that they could use for validation of their simulations. Although numerous journal articles using CFD to predict the performance of upper-room UVGI have been published previously, experimental measurements of efficacy needed for validation have been very limited [9], [10], [11], [12]. In addition, besides the usual boundary conditions required for modeling, such as room dimensions and supply and exhaust airflow rate and location, predicting upper-room UVGI efficacy requires knowledge of the UV susceptibility of the airborne organisms being inactivated and the UV fluence rate field in the upper room. UV susceptibilities were measured in the present study, and the UV fluence rate field was measured and modeled using a computer-aided design tool in a prior study [13]. Using all of this information, efficacy of upper-room UVGI was predicted using CFD and compared to the experimental results in a companion paper [14].",

For these conditions, if the air exchange rate is doubled, the airborne culturable bacteria concentration in the room will be halved. If there is also an inactivation process such as upper-room UVGI, the equivalent air exchange rate for UVGI can be defined as the additional increase in air exchange rate that would be necessary under the three conditions specified above to obtain the same viable airborne bacteria concentration without UVGI. For example, if the air exchange rate is 6 h\u22121 and upper-room UVGI reduced the viable airborne bacteria concentration by a factor of four, a hypothetical air exchange rate of 24 h\u22121 would result in the same concentration. Thus, the equivalent air exchange rate attributable to UVGI is the difference between this hypothetical air exchange rate and the actual air exchange rate\u2014that is, 18 equivalent air changes per hour.

Equivalent air exchange rate is an outcome parameter whose effect most people understand\u2014that is, analogous to air exchange rate under the conditions specified above, for every doubling of equivalent air exchange rate, the concentration of viable bacteria is halved and the risk is reduced accordingly.",

This chamber had been used previously to measure the UV susceptibility of other bacteria and viruses [22], [23], [24], [25]. The chamber and associated apparatus, which are shown in a schematic diagram in Fig. 2\n, were located in a biological safety cabinet to minimize the possibility that aerosol would escape from the chamber into the room or that stray organisms would enter the chamber. The chamber is divided into two zones: 1) a mixing zone containing baffles to induce mixing and drying of the bacteria-containing droplets and 2) an exposure zone where bacteria are exposed to a known constant UV irradiance. Relative humidity and temperature were measured with an Omega RH32 m (Omega Engineering, Stamford, CT) at the exit of the mixing zone. Temperature and relative humidity averaged 70 \u00b0F (21 \u00b0C) and 59%, respectively. The top of the UV exposure zone, which is 51 mm high, 240 mm wide, and 280 mm long, is a window made of fused quartz, which is essentially transparent to UV radiation. A Lumalier UV fixture (Memphis, TN) containing six 36-W low-pressure mercury lamps was located 0.5 m above the quartz window. This UV fixture was turned on at least 15 min before sampling began in order to stabilize the UV lamps. The UV irradiance in the exposure zone was adjusted by attenuating the UV radiation with multiple screens placed between the fixture and the quartz window to attain the desired irradiance in the exposure zone. The irradiance within the exposure zone was measured at 30 equally spaced locations using a Gigahertz Optik model 3718-2 UV detector sitting on the floor of the exposure zone and a model P9710-1 optometer (T\u00fcrkenfeld, Germany). The exposure time (t) of bacteria to UV radiation was calculated from the volume (V) of the exposure zone and airflow rate (Q) through it:(6)t=VQ\n",

Based on the regression lines shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, when the fan was blowing up and the air turnover rate was increased by changing the fan speed from low to high, the equivalent air exchange rate for M. parafortuitum decreased by 3%, whereas for B. atrophaeus spores, it increased by 52%.

However, their measurements were determined from experimental tests done in chambers that were assumed to be well mixed.

The spatial distribution of fluence rate in the upper room, which is also needed for CFD predictions of upper-room UVGI, is available from a previous publication [13]. In a companion paper with the same title as the present paper, but referred to as Part II, the efficacy of upper-room UVGI was predicted from simulations using both Eulerian and Lagrangian CFD [14].
