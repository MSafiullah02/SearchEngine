The sequence coding the complete N protein was digested with EcoRI and XbaI, ligated into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen), which digested with the same restriction enzymes produced the pcDNA3.1-N plasmid. To obtain the pYD1-N yeast expression plasmid, the full length of the N gene from the pcDNA3.1-N plasmid was excised with EcoRI and ApaI and then ligated into pYD1.

Although the amino acid sequence of the immunodominant epitope may be involved in these peptides and in protein segments expressed by prokaryotes, it is unlikely that polyclonal serum is sufficient to distinguish the linear from the conformational antigenic structures of individual antigenic domains and the minor or nonimmunodominant epitopes of the N protein (26). The linear epitopes of the N protein identified by probing the sera from SARS patients with synthetic peptides or protein segments expressed by prokaryotes (21)(22)(23)(25) were limited to the strongly immunodominant antigenic sites. For example, the linear epitope located in the region of amino acids 1\u201369 was not obtained by Pepscan or microarray analysis of sera from SARS patients (21)(22)(23). mAbs provide a more powerful tool than polyclonal serum or animal antiserum for defining the antigenic structures of a given protein in the context of the antigen\u2013antibody interactions and play a vital role in studies of viral antigenicity and immunology (27). Using a combined approach involving the N-protein\u2013specific mAbs, mouse antisera, and sera from SARS patients, we demonstrated that the mAb M9- and M11-specific linear epitopes were located in the regions containing amino acids 1\u201369 and 337\u2013422 of the N protein, respectively. Using polyclonal sera, we also observed that the third immunodominant linear epitope was located in the region containing amino acids 121\u2013213 on the N protein. The linear epitopes on the N protein that we identified are consistent with those reported previously, although we were able to obtain a better specificity.",

            "text": "We believe that it was necessary to use a eukaryotic system, such as the yeast surface display, to characterize the conformational epitopes of the N protein and specifically to differentiate antibodies raised to the linear from those raised to the conformational immunodominant epitopes in mammalian sera. The yeast surface display is a useful platform in directed evolution of protein expression (30) for the biochemical characterization of antibody-binding sites (35)(36) and for serologic analysis of antigens by recombinant expression cloning (SEREX) (34)(37). The yeast-displayed fusion protein stimulates expression of the native structure of the protein of interest. Linear epitopes can be distinguished from conformational epitopes on a given protein by analysis of the antigen\u2013antibody interaction before and after heat denaturation of a particular yeast-displayed protein. These features make the yeast display a suitable tool to accurately map the antibody epitope in mAbs, patient serum, and polyclonal antiserum from immunized small animals. For example, using protein microarrays to probe sera from SARS patients, Chen et al. (25) identified conformational epitopes in the regions covering amino acids 51\u2013208 and 249\u2013422 of the N protein. We applied the yeast surface display (34)(35)(36) in mAbs and mammalian sera to further define the precise locations of the conformational epitopes within the entire N protein. We first identified mAb M3-, M13-, and M10-specific conformational epitopes located in the regions covering amino acids 1\u201369, 212\u2013341, and 337\u2013422, respectively (Fig. 1C ), and at least 2 other epitopes in the regions covering amino acids 68\u2013213 and 214\u2013422 (Fig. 1C ). Three of 5 (amino acids 1\u201369, 68\u2013213, and 337\u2013422) conformational epitopes were immunodominant, as shown in the sera from SARS patients and the mouse antisera (Fig. 1C ). We have expanded the SARS-CoV N protein epitope profile with better specificity than that of previously identified epitopes and have also identified 4 novel conformational epitopes located in the regions covering amino acids 1\u201369, 68\u2013213, 212\u2013341, and 337\u2013422.",

The false-positive (38)(39)(40) and false-negative (14) results reported by investigators using the recombinant SARS-CoV N-protein\u2013based ELISA and Western blot analysis have raised concerns about using the recombinant full-length N protein, whole-virus antigen extracts, or virus-infected cells as reagents to diagnose SARS-CoV infections in humans and other animal species. Thus, the definite antigenic sites located on the N protein and epitope-specific mAbs identified in our study should enhance accurate serodiagnosis, serosurveillance, and retrospective studies of SARS.",

A clear-cut analysis of the humoral immunity induced by active (43)(44)(45) and passive (41)(42) immunization with the N protein in the formulation would be a prerequisite for the future use of these vaccines in immunoprophylaxis. Preservation of the conformational antibody-directed epitopes by maintenance of conformational integrity is important in designing recombinant protein vaccines and may require expression in eukaryotic cells (46), which is often neglected in the development of subunit vaccines. Our data on the N protein epitopes should help uncover the gene products and mechanisms of protective immunity relevant to SARS-CoV. The experimental strategies we describe may facilitate the discovery of epitopes of other structural proteins of SARS-CoV, as well as other viral proteins in humans and other animal species, which may be useful in developing subunit vaccine candidates for antiviral therapy.",

            "text": "The functions of the N protein, such as possible interaction with viral RNA and the composition of the viral core and nucleocapsid (47)(48)(49), are well documented in other coronaviruses, and several domains of the N protein play functional roles in viral biology. Primary genomic structural analysis has revealed that the SARS-CoV N protein contains a highly conserved motif located in the region of amino acids 111\u2013118 (FYYLGTGP) (50) and a unique lysine-rich region around amino acids 362\u2013381 (KTFPPTEPKKDKKKKTDEAQ) (51), findings suggesting that the protein acts as a nuclear localization signal (Fig. 1D ). The mAb-specific epitopes located in the regions covering amino acids 68\u2013213 and 337\u2013422 on the N protein suggest that mAbs M1, M4, M5, M6, M7, M10, and M11 could serve as biochemical markers to analyze the functional roles of these regions in SARS-CoV pathogenesis in other experimental systems. Although the N-terminal (amino acids 45\u2013181) structure of the SARS-CoV N protein has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (52) and this region has been promoted as the putative RNA-binding domain (53), the structure of the full-length N protein has not yet been determined. We found that 7 of 14 mAbs (M1, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, and M9) reacted only with the yeast-displayed full-length N protein (amino acids 1\u2013422) and the N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1\u2013213), but not with the C-terminal fragment (amino acids 214\u2013422), which specifically reacted with the other mAbs (M2, M8, M10, M11, M12, M13, and M14). This unexpected finding led us to speculate that the C-terminal fragment (amino acids 214\u2013422) is buried within the entire N protein and provides a clue to further explore the native structure of the N protein. The identification of specific antibody-binding sites in our study may assist in determination of the 3-dimensional structure of the full-length N protein and interpretation of the putative role of the N protein in the life cycle of the SARS virus.",

We identified the immunodominant antigenic sites responsible for antibodies in sera from SARS patients and antisera from small animals and used yeast surface display to identify the antigenic structures involved in these natural epitopes. The precise positions of these antigenic structures in the SARS-CoV N protein should be studied further to identify the exact amino acids involved. These antigenic sites of the N protein responsible for humoral immunity and histopathology will undoubtedly provide significant insight into the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV and will help in the design of potential molecular targets for new antiviral agents.",
