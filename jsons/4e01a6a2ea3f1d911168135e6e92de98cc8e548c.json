Exemplifying careful consideration of how cancer care and COVID-19 interact, Suppli et al. and McGinnis et al. present very interesting, timely, and potentially impactful case reports exemplifying how some care patterns may need to change during this pandemic.",

The patient was a 74 year old male receiving treatment with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Within the first 2 weeks of treatment, the patient developed COVID-like symptoms of fever, cough, fatigue, and myalgia. Unfortunately, infection with the SARS-CoV 2 virus was confirmed, the patient's symptoms progressed, and he ultimately passed away from COVID-19. In a parallel report by McGinnis et al., a 63 year old female with recurrent lung cancer was being treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), also commonly referred to as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). The patient was screened for COVID-19 symptoms with no presenting signs of infection. However, in both cases, review of image guidance scans supported infection.",

            "text": "As a part of standard radiotherapy (RT) to ensure accurate treatment for conventional RT or SABR/SBRT, patients commonly receive daily computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest. While image guidance CT scans may not have diagnostic quality of conventional CT scans from radiology departments, CT scans during RT provide sufficient detail to accurately align patients for daily RT and show sufficient detail to see mild to severe pulmonary opacification, atelectasis, effusions, and fiducial markers used to guide treatment. Review of daily imaging by Suppli et al. revealed multiple new pulmonary infiltrates between CT on day 7 and 8. Importantly, infiltrates were noted 36 hours prior to symptoms, but the interval between sequential CBCTs was 3 days over the weekend. The case report by McGinnis et al. demonstrated new bilateral ground glass opacities after a 20 day interval, but in a patient that was ultimately asymptomatic and required at home observation. For Suppli et al., patient symptoms were used to guide COVID-19 screening and scans were retrospectively reviewed after COVID-19 was confirmed. In contrast, McGinnis et al. noted changes on CT scans that then prompted COVID-19 testing. In both cases, authors proposed the utility of CBCTs for potential early detection.",

            "text": "Findings from both case reports exemplify how careful consideration and review of patient factors could be useful to aid in the diagnosis and management of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While it is critical to note that these reports are in just 2 pateitns, it also presents the opportunity for oncologists, and radiation oncologists in particular, to revise daily review of patient treatment. For most radiation oncologists who review daily CBCTs for localization, it can be very easy and quick to review images for new spotty pulmonary infiltrates or ground glass opacities during RT. This is by no means diagnostic at this time and infiltrates could represent other causes of infection or chemotherapy associated pneumonitis. However, infiltrates associated with radiation pneumonitis typically occur weeks to months after completion of RT. New infiltrates that develop from one day to the next or between subsequent treatments during RT are worthy of investigation. Because infiltrates between sequential CTs developed between Friday and Monday for Suppli et al., there is a possibility that new infiltrates could have been noted more than 36 hours prior to the onset of symptoms. The interval of 20 days reported by McGinnis et al. does not help narrow the window of observation. However, it is important to note that changes were observed in both a patient that was asymptomatic as well as a patient who developed severe disease and died. This suggests that new findings on image guided CT scans during RT could be useful to assist in COVID-19 screening and detection.",
