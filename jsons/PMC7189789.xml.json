According to the National Health Commission (NHC) of the People\u2019s Republic of China, until February 2020, there had been approximately 80,000 confirmed cases and more than 2000 deaths in China [3]. Other countries such as Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, and the United States also reported COVID-19 cases in their countries [4]. Although the cases at the early stage in these countries were identified as imported cases from Wuhan or other cities in Hubei Province, some domestic cases and local transmission were also reported.",

It is a generative statistical model with a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model. The basic assumption of this model is a combination of words belonging to different topics [15]. LDA indicates that there may be various topics in an article and that the wording in that article is attributable to one of its topics.

We used a coherence score to evaluate the selection of a suitable number of topics [20]. Topic coherence measures the consistency of a single topic by measuring the semantic similarity between words with high scores in a topic, which contributes to improving the semantic understanding of the topic. That is, words are represented as vectors by the word\u2019s co-occurrence relation, and semantic similarity is the cosine similarity between word vectors. The coherence is the arithmetic mean of these similarities [21]. We used the Coherence Model from Gensim (RARE Technologies Ltd), the Python package for natural language processing, to calculate the coherence value [22]. According to Figure 2, the coherence score increased and reached a stable score as the number of topics increased to 20, then declined after the number of topics reached 25. However, we found that the results would be uninterpretable for humans if only statistical measures were applied [23]. As a result, we combined statistical measures and manual interpretation and chose 20 topics to analyze with the help of Python version 3.6.1 and the LDAvis tool [15]. We set \u03bb=1 and set 20 topics and their keywords. Topics\u2019 names were generated according to their corresponding keywords to expatiate the topics.",

Although several COVID-19 cases were found in December 2019, we observed few news reports about them, showing that the press media did not focus on this disease at that time. As the outbreak became severe and more pneumonia cases were confirmed, the number of news reports began to steadily increase and then rapidly increased on January 19, 2020. In general, news trends peak and wane, according to the confirmed cases during other infectious disease outbreak periods; however, in some cases, the mass media cannot capture the outbreak in time and, therefore, fails to become the leading indicator [29]. This is because it takes time and rigorous effort for journalists to choose a topic, investigate the situation, collect data, and verify the authenticity of the material before they can finally present the news; as a result, a delay ensues. Mass media news reports lag behind the real time coronavirus developments, indicating that the media does not play an adequately forewarning function in public health communication and sensitization.",

Since the outbreak was so sudden and the transmission is so rapid, people in affected areas require medical material and other necessities, especially after the Chinese government shut the major entrance to Hubei to control the outbreak. The mass media can communicate with other parts of China to call for donations and support.",

We also observed that theme 6 (mental health) accounts for 4.38% (342/7791) of all news articles. Previous studies have shown that there was an increase in mental health problems in both the medical staff [33] and the residents under quarantine [34] during other previous disease outbreaks. Therefore, these kinds of news reports can help the readers refocus on this easily neglected area, and therefore, early interventions can be made. These two themes indicate that the mass media adopts a people-oriented principle when reporting on the COVID-19 crisis, contributing to the warm society phenomenon.",

First, we included a large number of Chinese news articles about COVID-19 from the WiseSearch mass media database, which only covers text news articles. However, the mass media has recently used new media platforms such as TikTok (video social media) and WeChat (the largest Chinese instant messaging app) to deliver health information through images, snapshots, and short videos. Therefore, we may have omitted news content and the impact of mass media in these media platforms. Second, we only selected a certain period of the outbreak. The pandemic is still ongoing, and the topics and themes are changing; therefore, we may have missed some novel topics and themes. Third, the LDA model has its own limitations such as a lack of nuances for qualitative thematic analysis and poor performance on short articles. Some relative studies introduced sentiment analysis to investigate the emotional differences in the message content [35]; it would be valuable if we could also apply sentiment analysis to supervise the news and investigate the public\u2019s reaction to news related to COVID-19.",
