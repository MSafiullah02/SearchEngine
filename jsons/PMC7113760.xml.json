The R&D Blueprint aims to reduce the time lag between the identification of a nascent infectious disease outbreak and approval of the most advanced products that can be used to save lives and prevent larger crises. It focuses on severe emerging diseases for which no, or insufficient, diagnostic, preventive and curative solutions exist, and which have the potential to generate a public health emergency. Diseases such as influenza, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, which have established control initiatives, R&D programs or existing product pipelines or regulatory pathways, are outside the scope of the Blueprint.",

These were subsequently expanded by WHO, and an outline of the eventual methodology was presented to, and validated by, the R&D Blueprint Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) in May 2016. Following input from the SAG, the methodology was further developed to include specific disease scenarios, a series of sub-criteria to explore different factors that could affect the relevance of a disease to R&D Blueprint objectives. WHO also developed the tools for Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) through a custom implementation of an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), developed in collaboration with leaders in the field.",

It was formally added in the website in March 2017. Disease X represents the awareness that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently not recognized to cause human disease. Disease X may also be a known pathogen that has changed its epidemiological characteristics, for example by increasing its transmissibility or severity. The inclusion of Disease X on the priority list makes it clear that the Blueprint explicitly seeks to enable cross-cutting R&D preparedness that as far as possible is also relevant for currently unknown diseases.",

In particular, the meeting heard of a need for improved diagnostics and vaccines for pneumonic plague and for additional support for more effective therapeutics against leishmaniasis.
