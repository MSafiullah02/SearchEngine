            "text": "The most effective tool for controlling an influenza pandemic is a suitable vaccine. For optimal effectiveness, the pandemic vaccine needs to be based on the causative strain and therefore, vaccine cannot be produced until the pandemic strain is identified. This criterion poses serious constraints in the capability of vaccine manufacturers to prepare pandemic vaccines in advance for stockpiles. In addition, a number of studies have shown that the hemagglutinin (HA) molecules of avian H5 viruses are poorly immunogenic [1], [2], where up to 90 \u03bcg of antigen (6 times the normal dose of human influenza virus HA) was required to elicit potentially protective responses in a substantial number of subjects [2]. This need for a larger antigen dose further reduces the availability of the \u2018limited\u2019 pandemic vaccines. In an attempt to increase the immunogenicity of the antigen, adjuvants like alum and MF-59 have been incorporated into vaccine formulations. Although alum may enhance the magnitude of the antibody response to a high dose of antigen, it does not have significant antigen-sparing effect [3], [4]. Other adjuvants, such as MF59 or a proprietary oil emulsion adjuvant, have been tested and data indicate that the inclusion of these adjuvants in the vaccine preparation would significantly increase antibody titers [5], [6].",

            "text": "Given the likelihood that a suitable vaccine will not be available before the onset of a pandemic, initial protection in a pandemic may have to rely on antiviral treatment and prophylaxis. Currently available anti-influenza drugs include neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) or ion-channel blockers (adamantanes). The success of these drugs, both for prophylaxis or therapeutics, is based on the susceptibility of the viruses to these drugs. Recently reported studies, however, have shown that a number of H5 isolates are resistant to these drugs [7], [8], [9]. These drugs or classes of drugs alone may thus be insufficient in protecting the human population from an influenza pandemic. An alternative, antigen-independent approach that could slow down the transmission of the virus and provide more time for vaccine production is thus highly desirable.",

            "text": "The toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a collection of receptors that detect conserved molecular components encoded by microorganisms (reviewed in Refs. [10], [11]) and stimulation of these receptors by specific ligands leads to the activation of the innate immune cells, such as dendritic cells (DC), macrophages and NK cells [12], [13], through a variety of signaling pathways, such as NF-\u03baB transcription factors, c-Jun NH2 terminal kinase (Jnk), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), resulting in quantitative and qualitative changes in immunological functions, including antigen presentation. In addition, cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12p40, are produced in vivo shortly after TLR activation [13], [14]. The production of these cytokines results in antiviral effects observed in a number of infection models. For example, administration of synthetic lipid A analogs (TLR4 agonists) protects mice against an influenza challenge [15]. A possible explanation for this anti-influenza effect could be related to the production of type 1 interferons, which induce the activation of IFN-stimulated genes including Mx proteins, protein kinase R and 2\u20325\u2019 oligoadenylate synthetase [16]. The induction of these proteins increases the resistance to the replication of the influenza virus [17], [18], [19].",

Our results show that PIKA has potent anti-influenza effect when administered 6 h prior to or immediately after influenza virus challenge in mice. The antiviral effect is not strain-specific. When used as an immuno-adjuvant, PIKA was able to achieve significant antigen-sparing effect. When incubated with immature DC, PIKA altered the expression pattern of a number of immune genes. In addition, PIKA was capable of interacting with both human and mouse TLR3, leading to the production of NF-\u03baB. Thus, in the face of a potential influenza pandemic, PIKA could be a candidate as a prophylactic drug or could be used as an adjuvant to increase the population coverage when pandemic vaccines become available.",

We sought to demonstrate that the enhancement of the humoral responses would lead to significant viral reduction in replication of challenge virus. Previous studies have showed that when administrated at between 1.5 and 5 \u03bcg per dose, different forms of influenza vaccine could induce robust antibody responses without any external adjuvant [27], [28], [29] with protection against viral challenge [27]. As shown in Fig. 4A, mice immunized with a single dose of the trivalent vaccine at 1.5 \u03bcg s.c. had robust antibody responses which were comparable to those induced when the vaccine was admixed with CFA. When the vaccine dose was reduced by 10-fold (0.15 \u03bcg), there was about 10-fold reduction in the magnitude of the antibody responses. To mimic a vaccine shortage situation, a dose of 0.015 \u03bcg, (\u223c100-fold reduction from the optimal dose) was selected and we evaluated whether the inclusion of PIKA could compensate for the reduction in antigen concentration. Groups of five mice were vaccinated with a suboptimal dose of Fluvax vaccine by the s.c. or i.n. route. Three weeks after priming, sera were collected from the mice before they were boosted. Sera were collected from the mice 3 weeks after boost. As shown in Fig. 4B, only two out of the five mice that received the vaccine without an adjuvant by the s.c. route had detectable amounts of anti-HA antibody in the primary response. For the CFA group, four mice had anti-HA antibody whereas all animals in the vaccine with PIKA group had detectable levels of anti-HA antibody. In the secondary responses, although all mice given vaccine alone developed anti-HA antibody, the antibody titers were significantly lower than those that were given vaccine with PIKA (p\n = 0.0119). As for intranasal delivery of vaccine, none of the vaccine protocols was able to elicit detectable anti-HA responses after one dose. When two doses of vaccine were given with PIKA, the vaccine recipient group showed a low titer of anti-HA response. The response was substantially improved by the addition of PIKA to the vaccine (p\n = 0.0079). Interestingly, the titer of the sera attained by two doses administered i.n. was comparable to titers achieved by two doses given by s.c. injection (p\n = 0.5762).",

On the other hand, the group given vaccine with PIKA showed the most potent viral reduction, with 99.8% reduction in viral titer compared to the PBS control group, and this difference was statistically significant (p\n = 0.0079). The group that received PIKA alone served as control to ensure that the observed reduction in pulmonary viral titer was due to the anti-HA antibody responses, instead of the direct inhibitory effects of PIKA on viral replication shown in the Fig. 1. The enhancement in viral clearance was also observed in the group that received the vaccine by the i.n. route (Fig. 4C). Mice that received either vaccine alone or vaccine with PIKA showed a 66.4% and 99.8% reduction, respectively, and the difference between the 2 groups was statistically significant (p\n = 0.0079). It is interesting to note that, although the group received the vaccine admixed with CFA had the highest antibody titers (Fig. 4B), however, the mice had higher pulmonary viral titers compared with mice received the vaccine administrated with PIKA (Fig. 4C). To investigate this discordance between the two parameters, the relative avidity of the antibodies of the two groups against the vaccine antigen was examined in a urea-displacement ELISA. As shown in Fig. 4D, the group received the vaccine with PIKA had antibodies with higher avidity to the surface glycoprotein of the virus as significantly more antibodies remained bound to the HA when exposed to 6 M urea as compared to those induced with CFA as an adjuvant (p\n = 0.0317).",

The efficacy was further boosted by a second dose of H5 vaccine with PIKA. Mice in this group showed a further 1000-fold reduction in viral titer (Fig. 5C). In addition, the vaccine-PIKA formulation was efficacious in reducing viral replication even when the vaccine was delivered intranasally.

Using primary immature DC culture, D1 cells, we examined how DC responded to PIKA stimulation in vitro. PIKA was added into DC cultures for 16 h following which total RNA was extracted from the cells. The expression level of more than 1000 immunologically related genes between PIKA-stimulated and unstimulated samples were compared using microarray technology. As shown in Fig. 7A, PIKA-stimulated DCs up-regulated expression of a number of cellular activation markers, such as CD80 and CD86 compared to unstimulated cells. A number of genes that have important immunological functions were also found to be up-regulated after PIKA treatment, including IRF-7 (interferon regulatory factor 7), IL-1, IL-15, IL-6 and IL-12 receptor. Many chemokines, such as MIP (macrophage inflammatory protein), Rantes, MCP-2 (macrophage chemoattractant protein) and IP-10 (interferon gamma inducible protein) were also found to have increased expression. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to confirm these findings. Using cDNA from unstimulated DC as the baseline, many genes were up-regulated in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7B). While certain genes, such as iNos and IL-12, were up-regulated to a comparable level in LPS-stimulated DC, other genes, such as CD40L, MIP3 and IFN-\u03b3, were up-regulated more readily by PIKA stimulation. To demonstrate that the observed changes in gene expression lead to changes in these cytokines/chemokines, the level of these proteins in the culture supernatants was measured. Consistent with the up-regulation of cytokine/chemokines genes, there was an increase in the production of these cytokines/chemokines in the supernatant from PIKA-stimulated DC compared with those from the unstimulated DC (Fig. 7C).",

Most human cases to date involve close contact with infected poultry and human-to-human transmission remains limited [35]. Nonetheless, the lack of anti-H5 immunity in humans, together with the continuous evolution of the virus in close proximity with the human population, threatens a pandemic. Should the virus acquire the property of efficient transmissibility between humans, in combination with the high case-fatality rate resulting from infection, this virus has the potential of causing an influenza pandemic with damage on a scale similar to that achieved by the 1918 \u2018Spanish\u2019 flu pandemic.

Our data demonstrate that administration of PIKA intranasally prior to or shortly after an influenza infection can inhibit influenza replication, leading to a significant reduction in pulmonary viral titers. This effect is unlikely to be due to a direct antiviral activity, because pre-incubating influenza virus with PIKA did not inhibit virus infectivity for embryonated chicken eggs (Lynn Tang, unpublished data). Instead, PIKA appears to act by stimulating the innate immune system (Fig. 7), resulting in the production of several chemokines, cytokines and interferons and these, in turn, mediate the observed antiviral activity. Myxovirus resistance (Mx) proteins, protein kinase R and 2\u20195\u2019 oligoadenylate synthetase are some of the products that have been reported to be up-regulated after type 1 interferon production (reviewed in Ref.

Furthermore, as PIKA does not target a specific component of the virion for its antiviral activity, it is likely to be effective against multiple strains and subtypes of influenza viruses as demonstrated in this study. This broad-spectrum activity is not limited to influenza A viruses only. A number of studies have shown that TLR-ligands are capable of inhibiting a wide range of viruses, including herpes simplex virus-2 [37], cytomegalovirus [38], parainfluenza [39], West Nile virus [40], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARs-CoV) [41] and influenza virus [42], [43]. The abovementioned advantages make this novel antiviral approach a compelling alternative to traditional antiviral drugs and vaccines especially since avian influenza viruses have rapidly developed resistance to antiviral drugs [44] and some mutant viruses can maintain drug-resistance without losing virulence [45]. In addition, Thitithanyanont et al. showed that stimulating DC with Poly(I:C) conferred the cells with resistance to the cytopathic effects of H5N1 virus which might be important for the induction of virus-specific immune responses during the infection [46].",

Using two different forms of influenza vaccine (split subunit vaccine and whole inactivated vaccine), the magnitude of the humoral responses elicited by the combination with PIKA was comparable to those formulated in Freund's adjuvant. Our observation is consistent with the report by Shen et al. [26] which showed that administering PIKA with hepatitis B vaccine boosted the humoral response. We explored the concept further by demonstrating that a substantial antigen-sparing effect could be achieved by incorporating PIKA into vaccines. Using the commercial split vaccine, the antigen-sparing effect was about 100-fold (Fig. 4A and B). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the augmented humoral response led to a functional reduction in viral titer (Fig. 4C). Our data also showed that successful immunization could be achieved by a non-parenteral route. With two doses, the magnitude of the response achieved by intranasal immunization was comparable to that achieved by subcutaneous immunization and was associated with a similar level of viral clearance. Our finding is consistent with the report from Ichinohe et al. [29] in which they showed that another TLR3 ligand, Ampligen, was capable of enhancing the immunogenicity of a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine when administrated intranasally. In their study, the enhancement effect was demonstrated using a higher dose of the trivalent vaccine (1 \u03bcg) and in this current study, we extended the observation further by showing that similar enhancement effect can be achieved even when the concentration of the immunogen was reduced to 0.045 \u03bcg (22-fold lower). The antigen-sparing effect of PIKA might be an important strategy for maximizing vaccine coverage when vaccine supplies are limited. It is of interest to note that although the group that received the influenza vaccine with PIKA did not have the highest antibody titer, it had the lowest pulmonary viral titer (a 10-fold reduction compared with the CFA adjuvant vaccine group). The higher avidity of the antibodies induced by the vaccine with PIKA might allow more effective inhibition of viral replication in vivo which translated into lower pulmonary viral titers as observed in this study. This suggests that in addition to augmenting the amount of antibody produced, PIKA may also have an impact on the quality of the humoral responses, such as affinity maturation [47], [48].",

Incubation of PIKA with primary immature murine DC in vitro resulted in maturation of dendritic cells, with marked up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD80 and CD86 and cytokines with potent immunostimulatory functions such as IL-12 and IL-15. Our observation is consistent with those observed by Shen et al. with BMDC [26]. The maturation process enables DC to act as a potent antigen presenting cells for effective activation of na\u00efve lymphocytes [13], [50], which in turn, leads to a more robust immune response. In addition, a study conducted by Perera et al. [51] showed that a vaccinia virus expressing IL-15 induced superior cellular and humoral immune responses compared to the parental strain. Therefore, the induction of IL-15 by PIKA could also have resulted in a more efficient induction of CD4+ T cell responses, translating to more robust humoral responses.",

            "text": "Lung tissue has recently been shown to constitutively express TLR3 in vivo in mice [52] and intranasal administration of PIKA could directly stimulate these TLR-3 expressing cells, which is perhaps why PIKA worked most effectively when administrated intranasally (Fig. 1D). We believe that PIKA will have similar antiviral activity in humans, because we showed that human TLR-3 can recognize PIKA (Fig. 6) and a number of studies have demonstrated the expression of TLR-3 in various respiratory cell types, such as nasal epithelial cells [53], airway smooth muscle cells [54] and airway epithelial cells [55]. In addition, ds RNA was found to be the most effective TLR ligand in activating airway epithelial cells in producing IL-8 [55]. Although our experimental data are limited to TLR-3, dsRNA can also be recognized by RNA helicase, RIG-1 and MDA5, and can induce NF-\u03baB activation with type-1 IFNs [56]. It is possible that PIKA stimulates several pathways in vivo to achieve its antiviral and adjuvant activities. The knockout-mice, such as TLR3 k/o, MDA5 k/o and RIG-1 k/o mice, will be useful in shedding more light on the contribution of these receptors to the activity of PIKA.",

            "text": "In summary, although Poly(I:C) has been shown to be an effective mucosal adjuvant, its use in clinical trials was associated with side-effects that has limited its usage [57]. In a recent toxicity trial, PIKA showed no significant toxicity in mice and a phase 1 clinical study showed that the use of PIKA as an adjuvant was well-tolerated in humans without significant side-effects (Peter Brazier, unpublished data). The safety profile, together with the long shelf-life, makes PIKA an attractive complement to currently licensed antiviral drugs. In the early phase of an influenza pandemic, when a well-matched vaccine is unlikely to be available, PIKA can be used as an antiviral drug for temporary protection of the susceptible population, slowing down the rate of viral transmission and allowing more time for vaccine production. Furthermore, global influenza vaccine production is likely to lag well behind the demand for pandemic influenza vaccine, so the inclusion of an effective antigen-sparing adjuvant such as PIKA can ensure that limited supplies of vaccine achieve maximum coverage.",
