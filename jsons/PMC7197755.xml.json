For example, SARS is caused by a corona virus for which there is no vaccine. First reported in Asia in February 2003, it spread to more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia over the following few months. Transmission of SARS virus is suspected to occur through droplets generated from sneezing or coughing of an infected person, which subsequently deposit on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose or eyes of nearby persons (CDC 2005). Various diseases, such as tuberculosis, mumps, measles, pneumonia, influenza in addition to many not known to humans, are transmitted by the airborne route (Biswas and Wu 2005; Fiegel et al. 2006). Through sneezing and coughing, thousands of droplets containing viable micro\u2010organisms can be released (Jennison 1942). The smaller droplets quickly evaporate to droplet nuclei, which can suspend in air for a long time and travel considerable distances either in free form or by attaching to other aerosols. Because of droplet encasement, virus infectivity can be shielded from external forces (e.g. drying, sunlight and temperature) (Tyrrell 1967).",

However, conventional high efficiency filters require high energy consumption (for HVAC system) or breathing exertion (respirators) because of its high pressure drop. Moreover, the surviving micro\u2010organisms collected on the filter can multiply and may be released into the air passing through the filter medium, thus resulting in microbial contamination of the breathing air (Richardson et al. 2006). Therefore, there have been efforts to incorporate antimicrobial agents into air filters, intended to destroy or inhibit the survival and growth of micro\u2010organisms (Foarde and James 2001; Cecchini et al. 2004).",

Iodine is slightly soluble and stable in water over the pH range of 6\u20138, and it is less reactive with organic nitrogenous contaminants than chlorine (Bruchertseifer et al. 2003). Among the various iodine species, iodine molecules (I2) and hypoiodous acid (HOI), which is produced by hydrolysis of I2, have disinfection capability (Chang 1958). Iodine can be attached to a quaternary ammonium strong\u2010base anion resin in the form of triiodide (I3\n\u2212) and pentaiodide (I5\n\u2212) ions.

However, only limited studies have been conducted recently on the disinfection capacity of iodinated resin filters for air treatment (Messier 2004; Heimbuch and Wander 2006; Heimbuch et al. 2007; Eninger et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2008; Ratnesar\u2010Shumate et al. 2008). The previous study in this series (Ratnesar\u2010Shumate et al. 2008) \u2013 investigating the performance of iodine\u2010treated filters for inert fluorescent particles and vegetative bacterial cells (Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli) \u2013 proposed a near\u2010contact transfer mechanism between the iodine\u2010treated filter and micro\u2010organisms penetrating the filter as an inactivation mechanism, but without solid proof. In the current study, a second possible source of inactivation was considered \u2013 I2 released from the filter. I2 released from the filter could cause inactivation in the sampling device, whereas I2 captured by micro\u2010organisms passing through the filter could inactivate them in their airborne state and/or continue the inactivation process after collection in the sampling device, either bound to the particle or by dissolving in the aqueous medium. Identification of inactivation by dissolved I2 could confound the results in earlier reports (Messier 2004; Heimbuch and Wander 2006; Heimbuch et al. 2007; Eninger et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2008; Ratnesar\u2010Shumate et al. 2008) that used plating methods to measure viable removal efficiency, which would require an independent experimental method to quantify the relative importance of two competing inactivation mechanisms.",

I2 collected in the impinger medium (1\u00b75 mmol l\u22121 Na2CO3 and 1\u00b75 mmol l\u22121 NaHCO3) can be analysed as iodide by ion chromatography (OSHA 1994).

In the selection of a model virus, its resistance to antimicrobial agents should be considered, because resistance varies from one virus to another (Berg et al. 1964; Sobsey et al. 1990). MS2 is a nonenveloped, icosahedron\u2010shaped, single\u2010stranded RNA with a single\u2010capsid size of 27\u00b75 nm, and it infects only male E. coli (Prescott et al. 2002).

The virus concentration in the Collison nebulizer was 105\u2013106 PFU ml\u22121 and was prepared by diluting 0\u00b710 or 0\u00b720 ml of virus stock suspension in 50 ml sterile DI water.

Based on the velocity, flight time through the 1\u2010mm filter is estimated to be 0\u00b7007 s. This face velocity, used by Safe Life Corp., corresponds to a certification testing of 100 cm2 media (Di Ionno and Messier 2004) against the 85\u2010Lpm flow rate specified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH 2005). Pressure drop across each filter was monitored with a Magnehelic gauge measuring 0\u20132491 Pa and recorded every 30 min.

As shown in Table 2, no surviving virus was detected in the experimental impinger until >104 PFU in the PBS was added to the impingers. As the virus concentration in the impinger increased, the number of surviving viruses also increased. Meanwhile, the survival fraction of viruses in the thiosulfate solution was much higher than that in the PBS. Most viruses suspended in the thiosulfate solution survived in the experimental impinger because of the quenching by reaction with thiosulfate of the I2 released from the iodine\u2010treated filter and/or transferred I2 to viral aerosols. Hatch et al. (1980) proposed spontaneous dissociation of I2 from the polyiodide\u2013resin complex as one of three possible inactivation mechanisms of their iodinated resin filter in water treatment. In another study (Marchin et al. 1983), acquisition of I2 by a cyst during passage through an iodinated resin column was hypothesized. The authors observed that cysts regained viability because of the reduction of I2 by thiosulfate solution for up to 3 min. A more recent study (Brion and Silverstein 1999) reported reversal of MS2 inactivation after a few minutes (<5 min) of iodine treatment by adding 0\u00b73% BSA. It must be noted that these studies were performed in water, so their applicability to inactivation mechanisms of iodine in air treatment is uncertain.",

As shown in Table 2, the survival fractions of MS2 in the experimental impinger having 3% and 6% BSA were similar to those in the control impinger (approx. 0\u00b795). The result indicates that both 3% and 6% BSA solutions contain sufficient protein to exhaust I2 released from the filter and thus isolate MS2 in the experimental impinger from inactivation by I2 in solution. The history of iodination of albumins suggests significant dependence on conditions. Muus et al. (1941) reported rapid uptake of 15 wt% of iodine by horse serum albumin (HSA) from approx. 0\u00b72 N I2/KI in aqueous ethanol, and Shahkrokh (1943) added 8 wt% of iodine to HSA with a similar concentration of I2/KI in water. Hughes and Straessle (1950) incorporated 30 molar equivalents of iodine into human serum albumin in 0\u00b71 N aqueous I2, converting 70% of l\u2010tyrosine residues into diiodotyrosine. Small\u2010scale preparations adding chloramine\u2010T to similar concentrations of K131I in water achieved fast and efficient incorporation of the 131I into human growth hormone (Greenwood et al. 1963), BSA (Opresko et al. 1980) and BSA microspheres (Smith et al. 1984). Lee and Ellis (1991) proposed the reaction with iodine solutions as a method to visualize serum albumins on polyacrylamide gels. However, Shahkrokh (1943) also showed that the extent of reaction of HSA with I2 falls off rapidly with decreasing concentration, and Portenier et al. (2001) reported that an equimolar amount of BSA did not suppress the bactericidal activity of a 0\u00b72% solution of I2/KI.",

In contrast, a similar experiment in which the penetrating particles and free iodine were collected in 3% BSA medium showed that half the penetrating MS2 virions were inactivated initially, and a moderate increase in survival was seen after 10 min. The initial observation is consistent with the mechanism proposed by Ratnesar\u2010Shumate et al. (2008), because the data in Table 2 show that the capture medium is able to consume all of the free iodine coming off the filter. Thus, at least half of the MS2 viral particles penetrating the filter in this experiment appear to have acquired and bound a lethal dose of I2 as they traversed the iodine\u2010treated filter. The distinguishable increase of surviving MS2 at 10 mins of collection time parallels a delayed reactivation of MS2 observed in aqueous iodine solutions (Brion and Silverstein 1999), and it is tempting to conclude that the deactivation processes in water and in this system are similar after iodine has been transferred to the virion. However, some combination of direct transfer of I2 from the filter plus dissociation of I2 from weaker binding sites on penetrating particles reproduces their general conditions and appears to cause almost half the observed inactivation of viral aerosols penetrating the iodine\u2010treated filter and collected in PBS medium. After submission of this manuscript, Triosyn Corp. (P.J. Messier, 2009, unpublished data) disclosed data showing a threshold for inactivation of MS2 and of Staphylococcus aureus at 0\u00b75\u223c0\u00b76 ppm I2 in PBS medium, which is consistent with results presented herein and defines a boundary condition to anticipate significant interference by dissolved iodine. We then verified that the data reported by Heimbuch and Wander (2006) and by Heimbuch et al. (2007) were measured under conditions that inactivation by free I2 did not contribute significantly.",

However, their observation of no inactivation by iodine during the steps of their workup that were executed in water shows clearly that the overwhelming excess of protein in their collection surface consumed all of the iodine displaced, released or captured from the iodinated medium. Whereas their experiment thus does not support the conclusion that the treatment is inactive, in the absence of measurements of I2 concentrations in the impingers, we can make no quantitative statement about the relative importance in our dataset of these potentially competing processes for inactivation. However, we note that, even though sufficient I2 is released to confound the environment in the impingers, the airborne concentration of I2 released from the filter was much less than the 8\u2010h time weighted average\u2010threshold limit value of 1 mg m\u22123, the level below which a worker is expected to have no adverse health effect resulting from chronic exposure (OSHA 2000; Di Ionno and Messier 2004).

Data from a different experimental approach might not encounter this uncertainty, and the assay is only a surrogate for the goal of the technology, enhancing respiratory protection against bioaerosol transmission of pathogens. Both the medium in the impinger and the protein gel have elements in common with respiratory mucosa, and for a person wearing individual protective gear, the time of transit from filter to mucosal surface is similar.
