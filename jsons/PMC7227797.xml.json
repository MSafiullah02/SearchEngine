There was no significant medical or surgical history; she was not taking any medicines or illicit drugs and had no history of allergies. On admission, review of her respiratory and cardiovascular systems was noted to be normal. Preoperative physical examination was normal, with a blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg, pulse of 90 beats/min, respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min, oral temperature of 36.6\u00b0C, and saturation of peripheral oxygen (Spo2) of 98%. Blood tests revealed a mild microcytic hypochromic anemia (hemoglobin 111 g L\u22121; white blood cell count 9.360 \u00d7 109 L\u22121; lymphocyte count 2.246 \u00d7 109 L\u22121).",

General anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 and rocuronium 0.5 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 and maintained with propofol 0.15 mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121 and remifentanil 0.4 \u00b5g\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121. She was intubated with a 6.5-mm endotracheal tube. The operation lasted 70 minutes, and the intraoperative course was uneventful. Anesthesia was reversed using atropine and neostigmine 0.04 mg\u00b7kg\u22121, and the patient was extubated. She was transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) with normal spontaneous breathing, Spo2 of 96%, and bilateral hemostatic nasal packing. About 30 minutes after arrival in the PACU, while the patient was awake and alert, she complained of trouble breathing. She was tachypneic, with Spo2 of 84. The auscultation of lung was unremarkable. There was no evidence of upper respiratory obstruction or pulmonary edema. She promptly received oxygen with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and dexamethasone 8 mg. Due to the recent surgery, however, the mask was placed only over her mouth. The Spo2 increased, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit while she was still on BiPAP. As the cause of her hypoxemic event was still unclear, a chest computed tomography (CT) was ordered. Surprisingly, imaging revealed bilateral multilobar patchy opacities predominantly in the posterior and peripheral regions, consistent with previously described radiologic features of COVID-19 (Figure). A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of a pharyngeal specimen confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19. She was treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate 200 mg twice daily and was discharged 48 hours later without any complaints (with Spo2 98%). She was isolated at home and daily monitored for 2 weeks after discharge, and the follow-up was unremarkable.",

In patients developing postoperative ventilatory distress, negative pressure pulmonary edema (NPPE) should be taken into account, especially following aerodigestive tract surgeries. Postoperative NPPE has been attributed to the laryngospasm due to stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve by bloody secretions or during intubation, extubation, or removal of throat packing.5 The physical examination of the upper and lower respiratory tract of our patient did not give any clue in favor of laryngospasm or pulmonary edema. The chest CT of patient revealed bilateral peripheral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary involvement of COVID-19.",
