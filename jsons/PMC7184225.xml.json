New (amended) regulations for clinical notifications came into force on 6 April 2010 (Box 21.2\n). Registered general medical practitioners (GMPs) in England and Wales have \u2018a statutory duty to notify a \u201cproper officer\u201d of the Local Authority of suspected cases of certain infectious diseases\u2019 \u2013 usually the consultant in communicable disease control (CCDC). The GMP should fill out a notification certificate immediately on diagnosis without waiting for laboratory confirmation and ensure that it reaches the officer within 3 days (telephone if urgent). The proper officers are required weekly to inform the Health Protection Agency (HPA) Centre for Infections (CfI) of the details of each case of each disease that has been notified. As well as notifications of the infectious diseases specified below, the 2010 regulations also require GMPs to notify cases of \u2018other infections or of contamination which they believe present, or could present, a significant risk to human health\u2019, e.g. emerging or new infections, or cases of contamination (such as with chemicals or radiation) \u2013 particularly if there is a risk of transmission to others.

Streptococcal oral or head and neck infections are shown in Table 21.4\n(see also Fig. 21.2\n). Most streptococci are highly susceptible to penicillin. Some pneumococci (mostly imported) are increasingly resistant. Few people who come in contact with GAS will develop invasive GAS disease, but people with chronic illnesses like cancer, diabetes and chronic heart or lung disease, and those on immunosuppressive medications such as steroids, have a higher risk. Persons with skin lesions (such as cuts, chickenpox or surgical wounds), the elderly, and adults with a history of alcohol abuse or injection drug use also have a higher risk for disease. Infection with GAS can result in a range of symptoms ranging from mild illness (streptococcal throat or a skin infection such as impetigo) to severe disease (necrotizing fasciitis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome [STSS]). About 25% of those with necrotizing fasciitis and more than 35% with STSS die (see below).",

Denture-related stomatitis (denture-associated stomatitis) is a common infection secondary to long-standing occlusion of part of the oral mucosa by a denture. Denture-related stomatitis typically develops beneath a well-fitting upper denture, which effectively cuts off the mucous membrane from the normal oral defence mechanisms. It is not seen under a lower denture, in spite of the fact that the latter is a common cause of trauma. The characteristic feature is uniform bright erythema of the whole of the upper denture-bearing area, limited by the denture margin. Occasionally, the erythema is patchy or there may be flecks of thrush. Symptoms are typically absent but occasionally there is soreness. Angular stomatitis is frequently associated. The vast majority of patients are healthy, as local factors alone determine the pathogenesis. Occasionally, patients may be anaemic but less frequently than might be expected from the fact that angular stomatitis is often regarded as a typical sign of iron deficiency. Other occasional contributory factors are dry mouth, diabetes mellitus or immune defects. It is, however, unjustifiable to screen all patients with denture-related stomatitis but investigation should be considered if the patient has any other complaints suggestive of such disorders or if the infection is particularly severe or intractable. Treatment includes leaving dentures out of the mouth at night and storing them in hypochlorite to clear the fungus from the denture surface. Topical antifungals should also be used, as suggested above, or the fitting surface of the denture can be coated with miconazole.",

The same host sustains the adult worm temporarily, but the larvae for a long period of time. After ingestion of infected meat, the larvae mature to adult forms in the intestine in approximately 1 week. Adult female nematodes then deposit larvae in the gastrointestinal mucosa. The larvae penetrate and subsequently enter the bloodstream and pass to muscles such as the tongue, masseter, gastrocnemius, deltoid and diaphragm, where they grow and develop, and become encapsulated.
