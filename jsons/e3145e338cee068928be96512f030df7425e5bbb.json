Many estimation methods require linking cases by direct transmission, a difficult task for most diseases. Using a subset of cases with detailed genetic or contact investigation data to develop a training set of probable transmission events, we build a model to estimate the relative transmission probability for all case pairs from demographic, spatial and clinical data. Our method is based on naive Bayes, a machine learning classification algorithm which uses the observed frequencies in the training dataset to estimate the probability that a pair is linked given a set of covariates. In simulations we find that the probabilities estimated using genetic distance between cases to define training transmission events are able to distinguish between truly linked and non-linked pairs with high accuracy (area under the receiver operating curve value of 95%). Additionally only a small subset of the cases, 10% -40% depending on sample size, need to have detailed genetic data for our method to perform well. We show how these probabilities can be used to estimate the average effective reproductive number and apply our method to a tuberculosis outbreak in Hamburg, Germany. Our method is a novel way to infer transmission dynamics in any dataset when only a subset of cases have rich contact investigation and/or genetic data.",

[24] developed a method to that successfully infers transmission chains using contact investigation data alone and combined with WGS data. However, even contact investigations cannot perfectly determine linked cases as some diseases can be transmitted through casual contact in public locations that would not be captured in typical contact investigations [32, 33] . Additionally, the effectiveness of contact investigations can depend upon characteristics of the disease such as the length of the latency period, the clustering of infections [29] , and the willingness of cases to share information about their contacts [31, 34] .",

Furthermore, WGS data is expensive to obtain and requires bioinformatics expertise and contact investigations are time consuming and require significant human resources. Therefore, these data sources are not universally available for many established infectious disease study samples.

In many applications these are two separate datasets. In the infectious disease applications we are considering though, we never know the true infector. Therefore in our training set the outcome, direct transmission between case pairs, is not known with certainty. However, many studies have more detailed information on a subset of cases, such as pathogen WGS and/or detailed contact investigation data which allow for the identification of probable linked and un-linked case pairs. We can use one or both of these sources of information to create a training set of probable transmission events. The rest of the cases which do not have these sources of information, are only included in the prediction set. Because the outcomes in our training set represent probable and not certain transmission events, we want to estimate the transmission probability of these case pairs as well as the other pairs which do not have pathogen WGS or contact investigation data. Therefore, we use an iterative estimation procedure to ensure that each pair has a turn in the prediction set. We split our training set into n subsets called folds where n -1 folds are used to train the model and the remaining fold is included in the prediction set. In our situation, this procedure is complicated by the fact that we assume that each case has only one true infector which presents two problems: 1) since the method of defining transmission events in the training set is not perfect, there could be multiple possible links for each infectee, and 2) once we denote a case pair as linked in the training set, all pairs that share that infectee have a zero-probability of being linked.",

Each outbreak is composed of numerous transmission chains of at least two cases which are simulated iteratively until the total sample size exceeded 500. The different transmission chains last for 20 years but have start and end points that vary in time. We simulate each transmission chain with the same outbreak parameters: a mean reproductive number (R t ) of 1.2, a serial interval distribution of gamma(shape = 1.05, scale = 2.0), and an effective population size times generation time (N eg ) of 0.25. We also include a delay between infection and sampling using the same distribution as the serial interval. The serial interval we use was estimated from a TB household contact story in Brazil (Ma et al, under review) . We then simulate representative pathogen genomes for each case. For each case we also simulated four different covariates representing clinical and demographic variables to inform the model. We also included the time between infection dates for each case pair into the model categorized as follows: less than 1 year, 1 to 2 years, 2 to 3 years, 3 to 4 years, 4 to 5 years, and more than 5 years.",

With this mutation rate, over the course of one 20 year transmission chain, very few mutations will accrue thus allowing a smaller genome to provide a good proxy for the full genome. The shortened genome length we simulate is meant to represent the locations that differ amongst cases sampled as part of one outbreak instead of the full genome. We also performed a sensitivity analysis which showed that the SNP distance for a fixed mutation rate did not notably change as genome length increased ( Figure 2 ).

Pairs with between 2 and 12 SNPs are considered indeterminate and thus are not included in the training set. To simulate real scenarios when only a fraction of the cases have the discriminating information necessary to define probable transmission events, we randomly select a subset of 50% of all cases to make up the training set. For comparison we also compute the relative transmission probabilities based on the serial interval used to simulate the data and the time between infection dates of each pair. We also compute probabilities using two mis-specified serial intervals, one that is too wide and one that is too narrow ( Table 1 ). This comparison is motivated by the Wallinga and Teunis [4] method for calculating the reproductive number in which the transmission probabilities are estimated from the serial interval distribution. The wide and narrow serial intervals represent the prior and posterior distributions used by Didelot et al. [23] in the analysis of the same TB outbreak in Hamburg that we analyze below. All of these serial intervals are shifted by 90 days because a serial interval of less than 3 months is not possible for TB, our motivating example.

To determine how well our method performed in identifying the true infector, we evaluated how the relative transmission probability of the true infector ranked compared to all possible infectors. compared to 95% (SD 1.0) when the model was trained using SNP distances. The probability of the true infector was ranked in the top 25% of all possible source cases on average 94% (SD 2.0) of the time both when the model was trained with true links and links determined by SNP distances. These results show that our estimated probabilities can distinguish between linked and non-linked pairs even when we train the model with only probable instead of certain transmission events. The probabilities calculated by our method outperformed probabilities obtained using any of the serial intervals in classification ability and especially in finding the true infector ( Figure 5 , Table 2 ). Figure 6 and Table 3 show the estimatesR t for each of the different scenarios compared to the value of 1.2 used to simulate the outbreaks. Our method estimated the reproductive number accurately as did the method using the correct serial interval. However, when incorrect serial intervals were used, the estimates ofR t were either too high or too low depending on whether the serial interval was too wide or too narrow respectively. In our sensitivity analysis of the proportion of cases needed to train the model, as expected, we found that the performance improves and the variability in the metrics decreases as the proportion of cases in the training set increases (Figure 7) . However, if the sample size is at least 500 then only 10% of all cases are needed to train the model to obtain good performance. If the sample size is between 200 and 500, training the model with 20% of cases results in good performance. For smaller outbreaks, at least 40% of the cases need to be in the training set to obtain the same performance level (Figure 8) . When there is a small proportion of cases in the dataset, our method over-estimates the average effective reproductive number slightly. The estimates get increasingly accurate as the training dataset increases and as long as around 40% of cases are included in the training dataset the estimates are close to the true value ( Figure 9 ).",

These pairs were separated by between 0 and 20 SNPs, with a median of 4 SNPs between them. Of the 86 individuals, 31 (36%) were part of contact investigations performed by the local health authorities resulting in 51 case pairs with confirmed contact with each other. All individual-level covariates were transformed into pair-level covariates as detailed in Table 6 . We used these covariates to estimate the relative transmission probability for all case pairs from this outbreak. We trained the model in two ways: using SNP distances or contact investigations. Figure 11 shows heatmaps of all potential infectors for each infectee using our method compared to random probabilities ( Figure 11A ) and the correct serial interval ( Figure 11B ). When our method is applied, either with SNP distance defining links in the training set ( Figure 11C ) or with confirmed contact defining links ( Figure 11D ), the plots display more variation in the relative transmission probability across possible infectors than the serial interval or random scenarios. For some infectees there are infectors with a higher probability than all others in the row indicating the likely true infector. However, even for rows without a For all of the methods, we calculated R t per month andR t with bootstrap confidence intervals. Since this was a smaller time frame than our simulations, when estimatingR t we only removed the last 10% of the months. The monthly R t values for each scenario can be seen in Figure 12 . All of the methods except random probabilities show spikes in monthly reproductive numbers right around the second peak in case counts ( Figure 12 ), but to different degrees.",

We found that either method allowed for the elimination of many transmission links ( Figure 11 ). The two ways of training the model did not produce identical results which is expected because the two models are trained on different ways of defining probable transmission events, neither of which perfectly capture the truth. Using contact investigation to train the model is more discriminating than using SNP distance because the cases are known to have interacted, but it also could also miss links from unknown contacts. Using SNP distances to train the model will result in fewer missed links, but it could connect cases who never interacted. The two methods result in similar estimates for theR t and we hypothesize that the true reproductive number for M. tuberculosis in this context lies in between these two estimates (0.9 -1.0).",

When it comes to estimating transmission parameters, simply knowing clusters does not provide enough information and identifying the true infector is often impossible in practical applications. The strength of our method is that it does not aim to find the one true infector but estimates the relative probability of transmission for all sampled infectors. This gives our method broad applicability. It can be used to find potential true infectors -pairs with very high probabilities or identify clusters of transmission -groups of pairs with high probabilities. The probabilistic nature of the estimates can then be used to further estimate transmission parameters incorporating the uncertainty around the true infector.",

Although traditionally a naive Bayes model is trained with a training set of true events, this will never be available for real-life infectious disease applications; however, WGS data for a subset of cases may be readily available in some outbreak settings. We have shown that our method performs almost as well when SNP distance is used as a proxy for transmission to train the model as when true transmission is used as to define links in the training set.",

Our probability estimates themselves do not assume all cases in an outbreak are sampled because we are simply estimating how much more likely it is that one case was infected by another than by any other sampled case.

However, in diseases such as TB, where there can be months to years between infection and development of disease (if this ever occurs), and where delay in seeking care and getting properly diagnosed can be substantial [61, 62] it is possible that cases present to care in a different order than they were infected.

Our method is flexible, using whatever sources of information are available without making any prior assumptions about the relationship between these covariates and transmission. The power of our method is that only a subset of cases (10-40% depending on the sample size) need to have pathogen WGS data or contact investigation data, allowing this method to be applied to a wide range of outbreak and surveillance datasets. These probabilities can be used to better understand the transmission dynamics of an outbreak by identifying possible transmission events and estimating transmission parameters. In a disease where determining transmission events can be extremely difficult, using probabilities of transmission between all possible cases provides a unique and powerful analysis tool. Figure 1 : Flow-chart depicting the algorithm we used to create the training dataset and the iterative procedure to estimate the relative transmission probabilities. 13 Figure 2 : Violin plots representing the effect of changing genome length on the SNP distance distribution between case pairs. Pathogen genomes of various lengths from 50 to 4.4 million base pairs were simulated 100 times each for an outbreak of 200 cases. The resulting SNP distance matix for all case pairs was computed. The figure shows the relationship between genome length on the quartiles of the SNP distance distribution as well as the maximum SNP distance and the percent of pairs with less than 2 SNPs and more than 12 SNPs.
