CT chest images for COVID-19 positive cases have a distinct radiographic pattern: ground-glass opacities, multifocal patchy consolidation, and/or interstitial changes with a predominantly peripheral distribution [2, 3] . A study of 21 patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus, found that 15 (71%) had involvement of more than two lobes at chest CT, 12 (57%) had ground-glass opacities, seven (33%) had opacities with rounded morphology, seven (33%) had a peripheral distribution of disease, six (29%) had consolidation with ground-glass opacities, and four (19%) had crazy-paving pattern. No lung cavitation, discrete pulmonary nodules, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathy were seen. Fourteen percent of patients (three of 21) presented with a normal CT scan [3] . Information and CT scans are available from this current outbreak, which shows the evolvement of lung opacities over time, from symptom onset to 41 days from onset ( Fig. 1) , in a COVID-19 positive patient [4] .",

For example, one study developed on existing 2D and 3D deep-learning models, combining them with the latest clinical understanding, and achieved an AUC of 0.996 (95%CI: 0.989-1.00) for Coronavirus vs Non-coronavirus cases per thoracic CT studies. They calculated a sensitivity of 98.2% and a specificity of 92.2% [8] . This system comprised of several components and analyzed each CT case at two distinct levels: Subsystem A: 3D analysis of the case volume for nodules and focal opacities (using a commercial software called 3D lung volume from RADLogics Inc.) and Subsystem B: newly developed 2D analysis of each slice of the case to detect and localize larger-sized diffuse opacities including ground glass infiltrates. Furthermore, they proposed a Corona score: a volumetric measurement of the lung opacities, and an effective way to monitor patient progress over time. This study performed much better than the one reviewed in this paper, in terms of rate of detection, sensitivity, and specificity, mainly because the system used was specifically developed for the detection of COVID-19 manifestations. Such fast and accurate analyses of CT datasets, as can only be provided by optimized AI models, is crucial for front-line clinicians screening patients during this pandemic. Infervision launched a coronavirus artificial intelligence solution in China this past month that is tailored for front-line use to help clinicians detect and monitor the disease more effectively.",
