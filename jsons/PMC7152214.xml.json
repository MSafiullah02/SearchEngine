            "text": "The medical importance of bats (order Chiroptera) to human health is increasingly recognized. They are either proven or potential reservoirs and vectors of zoonotic human pathogens, especially viruses.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Viruses from 24 different families have been detected in bats, often without obvious deleterious effects on their hosts, leading to the suggestion that peculiarities of their immune system may allow them to resist the effects of viruses that are highly pathogenic in other mammals, including human beings.6 Transmission may be direct, by bat bites or scratches, or through more subtle contact such as touching intact mucous membranes or inhalation of aerosol created by bats\u2019 urine; or transmission may be indirect, by infecting other mammalian hosts, or by creating in their accumulated feces (bat guano), a culture medium for pathogenic fungi whose spores may be inhaled by people entering bat caves. Bats may damage fruit crops, and cattle and other domestic animals are vulnerable to bat-transmitted infections. In Latin America, vampire bat\u2013transmitted bovine rabies (\u201cderriengue\u201d) and trypanosomiasis (Trypanosoma evansi infection causing \u201csurra\u201d) threatens meat production. Nipah virus causes fatal disease in pigs in Southeast Asia, where epidemics have led to the culling of more than 1 million of these animals. Hendra, Menangle, and Tioman viruses have been responsible for fatal diseases in horses and pigs in Australia and Malaysia. However, bats are much less important, medically and economically, than rodents, although they host more zoonotic viral infections per species. Rats, mice, and voles are vectors and reservoirs of many prevalent zoonotic pathogens, such as Hanta and Arena viruses, plague bacillus, leptospires, rickettsiae, and parastrongyloids. Rodents also consume crops and food stores and damage human dwellings and installations. In their favor, bats are fascinating and beautiful animals that are protected and conserved in many Western countries and that benefit the environment by controlling insects, pollinating fruit trees, and distributing seeds. Bats are eaten medicinally in China and elsewhere, and as a delicacy and valuable source of protein in West Africa, Southeast Asia, Indonesia, New Guinea, and Australia (by native Australians). Catching and butchering bats and consuming inadequately cooked bats incur the risk of infection.",

            "text": "Bats have a number of special characteristics, some of which are unique. They show extreme diversity, with their approximately 1100 species constituting 20% of all mammalian species, and they are widely distributed in all continents except Antarctica and some oceanic islands. Some species breed within the Arctic Circle. Bats are enormously abundant, sometimes occurring in colonies, flocks, or clouds composed of as many as 20 to 30 million individual animals. In caves inhabited by Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis), there may be more than 4000 bats/m3 in their cave roosts that accommodate up to 1 million bats. Bats are the only mammals capable of self-powered flying, as opposed to gliding. Some species migrate more than 1500 kilometers, and North American hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus\u2014Vespertilionidae) have reached Iceland and the Orkney Islands in the UK. The wing membrane is formed by the skin of the back and belly, and is supported by elongated fingers, externally rotated and adducted legs, and, in some cases, the tail. Some bats, such as true vampires, are also capable of quadrupedal gait. Most bats are nocturnal. They are the only vertebrates capable of catching insects in complete darkness, achieved by the use of sophisticated echolocation. Bats are variously insectivorous, frugivorous, flower-feeding, hematophagous, or carnivorous. Their weight ranges from 2 g in Craseonycteris thonglongai (the smallest of all mammals) to 1.6 kg in the largest species of Pteropis and Acerodon. Metabolic flexibility allows them to be heterothermic (extreme variation in body core temperature 2\u00b0C\u201341\u00b0C) and to hibernate. During flight, their body temperature rises above 38\u00b0C. They are the longest-living of tiny mammals (e.g., Myotis lucifugus, weighing only 7 g, has lived to 35 years). Bats roost, hanging upside down from their feet or clinging onto surfaces, in human constructions such as roof spaces, eaves and attics of dwellings (bringing them into close contact with people), tombs, temples, mines, pipes, irrigation tunnels, and bridges, and in caves, rock crevices, foliage, tree cavities, trees, and bird and termite nests. Some species can fashion tent-like shelters out of leaves. Recently an epidemic of white-nosed syndrome has killed more than a million bats in the northeast United States and Canada. A cold-growing fungus, Pseudogeomyces destructans (\u201cwhite-nosed syndrome fungus\u201d) is the cause. Bats are infested with numerous ectoparasites, including bat flies, fleas, mites, ticks and Chimex bugs.",

Diaemus and Diphylla feed largely on birds but occasionally on humans, whereas Desmodus prefers mammals, especially large domestic herbivores. Self-sharpening incisor and canine teeth are modified to allow painless venesection. The vampire's saliva flows down a groove on the dorsal surface of its tongue into the wound. Salivary toxins increase capillary permeability, inhibit platelet aggregation, inhibit activated factors X and IX (\u201cdraculin\u201d), and activate plasminogen (\u201cdesmoteplase\u201d\u2014currently being developed as a thrombolytic drug, DSPA-alpha-1).",

            "text": "Rabies (classic Species 1) is enzootic in many, but not all, vampire bat populations. Since the late 14th century, European explorers of the Caribbean and South America reported the association between vampire bat attacks and fatal human illness. From 1925 to 1936, there was an epizootic of vampire bat rabies in Trinidad, with 2000 fatalities in cattle and horses and 53 human deaths from the paralytic form of rabies. Initially, it was misdiagnosed as oleander poisoning, bulbar paralysis, botulism, or grass disease in the animals and poliomyelitis in the patients. Ecologic changes, such as destruction of forest and introduction of cattle ranching, construction of trans-Amazonian highways, the invasion of newly accessible jungle by gold miners, and electric power failures that deprived jungle communities of protective lighting, have led to small epidemics of human rabies transmitted by vampire bats. These have accounted for more than 500 deaths since 1975, usually affecting rural communities of indigenous Amerindians, such as the Warao in northeast Venezuela. There have been recent outbreaks in Colombia (Choc\u00f3, Santander) and Peru (Condorcanqui, Bagna, Puerto Maldonado, Ayacucho, and in 2016\u20132017, 85 human cases in Cuzco District), Brazil (Para, Maranh\u00e3o), and Venezuela (Delta Amacuro). Humans are bitten at night on their extremities, ears, and faces. Children appear particularly vulnerable. They may not wake up but discover bleeding wounds showing a double puncture made by the incisors or a depressed lesion with a raised edge (Figs. 140.16\nand 140.17\n) in the morning. Mosquito nets are normally protective, but accessible body parts may be attacked, and the vampire bat's melena stool may be found staining the net (Fig. 140.18\n). Historical epidemics of vampire bat rabies, like the Trinidad cases, were characterized by predominantly paralytic disease, but a minority of patients develop hydrophobia and other features of furious rabies. Vampire bat\u2013related strains of classic Species 1 rabies virus have been found in many South American wild and domestic mammals and have been transmitted to humans, for example, by pet marmosets in northeast Brazil.",

Bat-proofing of dwellings and sleeping under mosquito nets afford some protection, and electric house lighting may deter vampire bats. Vampire bats are highly susceptible to anti-coagulants, such as warfarin, which can be distributed to colonies by capturing the bats and releasing them after plastering them with warfarin paste. Treatment of cattle with controlled doses of warfarin will kill vampire bats feeding on them.

Fifteen were associated with Lasionycteris noctivagans or Pipistrellus subflavus, 11 with Tadarida brasiliensis, and 1 each with Myotis spp. and Eptesicus fuscus. However, there was a clear history of a bat bite in only a few of these cases, although some had been in direct contact with bats and others had bats in their homes. This suggests the possibility of subtle contact, such as the bat's licking an open wound or intact mucous membranes of a sleeping person.13, 14 Bat strains of Species 1 appear more tolerant of low temperatures and are more able to replicate in endothelial cells than canine strains of Species 1. The recovery of two American children from bat-transmitted rabies encephalomyelitis may also suggest decreased virulence of bat strains. Aerosol transmission of rabies was claimed to explain infection of two visitors to Frio Caves in Texas inhabited by 20 to 30 million T. brasilensis, but it is far more likely that they were infected transdermally.",

An aggressive bat is likely to be unwell, perhaps rabid. All cases of scratches, bites, and possible mucosal contact should be reviewed for possible post-exposure rabies prophylaxis. Even the handling of a dead bat has been associated with transmission. Grounded, trapped, or sick bats should ideally be handled only by experts and never without gloves. The risk of inhaling aerosolized fungal spores and acquiring other bat-related diseases must be recognized by cave explorers (spelunkers) and prevented by wearing appropriate clothing and masks.",
