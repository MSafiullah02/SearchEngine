Therefore, the first step is to closely monitor the mild patients to prevent disease exacerbation. The clinical manifestations, vital signs, blood oxygen saturation, fluid volume, gastrointestinal tract function and mental state of all patients should be dynamically monitored every day. In addition to routine testing of laboratory parameters, some potential indicators for severe cases should also be monitored and regularly followed up for testing, including lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, IL-6, peripheral blood lymphocyte count and CD4+ T lymphocytes, etc.1,2 For patients with high risk of severe illness, anticoagulation treatment with heparin is recommended. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) should be maintained at 1 to 2 doses per day until the level of D-dimer returns to normal. For conditions of FDP \u2265 10 \u03bcg/mL and/or D-dimer \u2265 5 \u03bcg/mL, unfractionated heparin is recommended.",

An early study in France suggested that in 6 asymptomatic nucleic acid-positive patients, the treatment of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin resulted in a 100% negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from the nasopharyngeal swabs. But the sample size of this study was too small to obtain statistical results between the groups and this has caused controversial opinions.9 A recently released study involving more than a thousand patients in IHU M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection, Marseille, France suggested that the disease progression rate of patients using hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin was 4.3%, and the mortality rate among these patients was 0.47% (http://www.mediterranee-infection.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Abstract_Raoult_EarlyTrtCovid19_09042020_vD1v.pdf). The mortality rate seemed relatively lower compared to that previously reported for COVID-19 cases, but the study also lacked a control group and hasn\u2019t yet gone through the peer review process. More studies on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin will still be needed.",

Based on retrospective analyses of the previous use of glucocorticoids in SARS, H1N1 and other viral pneumonia, the routine use of glucocorticoids is not supported by the World Health Organization (WHO).11 However, in clinical practice, glucocorticoids tend to be more frequently used in severe or critical illness. Therefore, if the confounding factors are not adjusted, it is difficult to scientifically evaluate the role of glucocorticoids.",

The first point is \u201chigh risk of disease progression\u201d. The mechanism of glucocorticoids is to suppress excessive immune responses. In most mild patients, the immune response against the virus is beneficial. The use of glucocorticoids may reduce the clearance of the virus; while for severe or critically ill patients who have already produced a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d, the use of glucocorticoids is too late to block this excessive inflammatory response. Therefore, glucocorticoids should be used in the early stage of excessive inflammatory reactions to achieve the best results. According to our experience, clinical manifestations of this period are characterized by rapid radiography progression with or without deterioration of oxygenation levels. That is to say, for patients with mild disease, if there is obvious progression of lung lesions within 48 h, the application of glucocorticoids can be considered to prevent the serious development of these patients. Another key point is \u201clow-to-moderate-dose, short-course\u201d. In the case of early application for treating excessive inflammation, the use of low-to-moderate-dose, short-course glucocorticoids might be effective. According to our experience of treating COVID-19 patients at Shanghai, the dose of methylprednisolone was 40\u201380 mg/day for 3 days, which was then tapered to 20 mg/day, with a total treatment period of less than 7 days. With this dose of treatment, the side effects and adverse reactions of glucocorticoids are very limited, with satisfactory safety profiles.",
