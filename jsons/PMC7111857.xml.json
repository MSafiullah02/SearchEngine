The microchips have been fabricated in silicon, glass, quartz and plastic substrates. Plastic chip has been frequently used recently because of its advantages in biocompatibility and lower cost as well as increased flexibility with respect to fabrication methods and substrate dimensions [1]. Plastic chips can be made of a variety of polymeric materials, such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) [2], polycarbonate [3], SU-8 photoresist [4], Zeonor 1020 [5] and the elastic poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) [6], [7]. Polymeric substrates have then been patterned by laser ablation [1], X-ray lithography [8], injection-molding [9] and imprinting with master templates [10].",

Three micro-channels were fabricated on an electrophoresis chip (Fig. 1\n). Initially, the silicon template was fabricated with a previously described method [2]. Briefly, the schematic of the channels was first drawn using the CAD software. The image was reproduced on the chrome glass to serve as mask for photolithography. An oxide silicon layer was produced on the surface of a 4 in. silicon wafer with crystal orientation \u30081 0 0\u3009. Subsequently, a layer of photoresist was spin-coated over the oxide silicon layer, followed by being exposed to UV light through the mask aligned to the wafer flat. The photoresist was then developed to reveal the transferred image. Therefore, all the area defining the channels was exposed in this step. The exposed silicon oxide layer was etched with hydrofluoric acid before serially rinsed with distilled water and acetone to remove the photoresist.",

The beam is reflected by a dichroic beam splitter (Omega Optical) and focused into the channel through a 20\u00d7 microscope objective (0.4 NA). The emission signal is collected by the same objective and transmitted back through the dichroic beam-splitter. The emission beam passes through a bandpass filter (Omega Optical), which may be alternated easily to fit a wide selection of dyes, and is focused by a focusing lens through a 400 \u03bcm pinhole. The photo-multiplier tube (Hamamatsu Photonics R212, Japan) is mounted in an integrated detection module including high voltage power supply, voltage divider and amplifier.

Lower field strength gives higher resolution, while higher field strength facilitates fast separation but increases electrophoresis current.

Microchip electrophoresis showed higher sensitivity in the detection of SARS virus. We ascribed the reason to sample collection; the samples of SARS virus infection were all collected at day 10, when the virus was presented in body fluids at high levels, while that of hepatitis B virus infection were collected during intervals of antivirus therapy. Therefore, the level of hepatitis B virus in blood can be very low during the recovery phase. Microchip electrophoresis showed much higher sensitivity and less time consumption than agarose gel electrophoresis. The relatively low sensitivity of gel electrophoresis, which might cause false negative seems to be disadvantage for PCR products detection. Electroosmotic flow in the channel of PMMA chip was minimized using HPMC\u2013TBE buffer as a dynamic coating, which was stable for multiple injection/separation operations and provided reproducible results. Separation time was therefore decreased with the absence of electroosmotic flow. Since DNA was less adsorptive to the surface of the micro-channel of PMMA chip, peaks with good form were obtained. The high resolution of microchip electrophoresis enables rapid analysis of multiple PCR products and the high sensitivity ensured low level of virus copy could be detected. At the same time, experiments became convenient with the fast separation and simple operation.",
