Compared with the general population, cancer patients are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 and even developing critical symptoms because of weakened immune system [1], [2]. In this letter, we propose a system of preventative measures to avoid cross infection, which were developed and implemented during the initial clustered COVID-19 outbreak here in Wuhan. Between Jan 1st to Mar 28th, 2020, when the outbreak was at its peak in the city, 679 patients received treatment in the Tongji radiotherapy (RT) center, only one of which was later confirmed to have contracted COVID-19, demonstrating the effectiveness of our measures. It is therefore our sincere wish to share the experience with the global community.",

Second, patients should wear the mask during the treatment. If patients have to take off the mask during the treatment, additional face shield must be placed properly. Third, treatment room needs to be cleaned and disinfected using UV radiation. Frequency should be once every two hours, 30 minutes each time.
