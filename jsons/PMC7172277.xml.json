Such exacerbation possibly occurs by secretion of trypsin-like proteases by bacterial stimulation of host cells to produce or secrete more protease, or destruction of endogenous cell protease inhibitors (Mancini et al., 2005) and suppression of the immune system due to stress (Kishida et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Similar virus tracheal shedding titers were detected in the variant IBV infected birds either single or mixed infections with AIV-H9N2, however, in the current study, the classical IBV shedding significantly increased with AIV-H9N2 mixed infection. Elevated virus shedding titers of AIV-H9N2 in presence of IBV infection was previously reported (Monne et al., 2013). Similarly, in this study, significant increases of AIV-H9N2 virus shedding with classical IBV infection especially at 2 and 5 DPI and with the variant and vaccine IBV strains co-infections up to 7 DPI were observed. However, the only significant elevation of AIV-H9N2 HI antibody titers was recorded with the classical IBV co-infection at 10 DPI. This may be attributed to the earlier and higher replication of both AIV-H9N2 and classical IBV viruses as indicated by higher viruses shedding titers as early as 2 DPI. These results and previous studies results indicate the possible synergistic mechanism between IBV and AIV-H9N2 possibly by trypsin-like proteases encoded by coronaviruses that enhance the AIV-H9N2 hemagglutinin cleavage (Haghighat-Jahromi et al., 2008, Klenk and Garten, 1994, Liu et al., 1995, Ng and Liu, 2000, Perk et al., 2004).",
