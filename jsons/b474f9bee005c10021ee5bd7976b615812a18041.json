Not all ICU patients who deserve a chest CT scan for suspected pulmonary embolism are promptly diagnosed and indirect objective examinations, i.e., echocardiography or lung ultrasonography do not help. It may be that an unexpected worsening of the respiratory function together with a sudden increase of D-dimer levels are suggestive of pulmonary embolism, but this remains to be demonstrated. To date, D-dimer levels help in predicting the severity of the disease and patient's prognosis, as patients with high levels at admission die more than those with normal levels [7].",

The disease, defined 'COVID-19', since Jan 2020 has spread in Italy, particularly in Milan and other cities in Northern Italy. On March 11, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The mortality rate in Italy exceeds 12% and is up to 26% in intensive care units (ICUs) [1] . After an early phase characterized by mild symptoms, patients with COVID-19 infection may develop an interstitial pneumonia associated with an acute inflammatory state [2] . Autopsy findings showed the occlusion on the small vessels of the lungs (and also other organs) [3] , possibly because of an intense cytokines secretion associated to an endothelial impairment bringing to the activation of the coagulation cascade.",
