This novel H1N1 strain was quickly termed \"swine flu\", in reference to its alleged origin in pig populations before jumping the species border to humans. Very quickly public health institutions were alerted and saw the risk of this local influenza epidemic becoming a major public health problem globally. The concerns were serious because this influenza strain was of the H1N1 subtype, the same virus family that caused one of the biggest pandemics in history, the Spanish flu that killed up to 40 million people in the beginning of the 20th century [2] . The swine flu epidemic did indeed develop into a pandemic, spreading across the globe in matters of months. Luckily, the strain turned out to be comparatively mild in terms of symptoms and as a health hazard. Nevertheless, the concept of emergent infectious diseases, novel diseases that may have dramatic public health, societal and economic consequences reached a new level of public awareness. Even Hollywood picked up the topic in a number of blockbuster movies in the following years [3] . Only a few years later, MERS hit the news, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, a new type of virus that infected people in the Middle East [4] . MERS was caused by a new species of corona virus of the same family of viruses that the 2003 SARS virus belonged to. And finally, the 2013 Ebola crisis in West African countries Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea that although it did not develop into a global crisis killed more than 10000 people in West Africa [5] .",

            "text": "Population density is only one side of the coin. In addition to increasing faceto-face contacts within populations we also witness a change of global connectivity [9] . Most large cities are connected by means of an intricate, multi-scale web of transportation links, see Fig. 19 .1. On a global scale worldwide air-transportation dominates this connectivity. Approx. 4,000 airports and 50,000 direct connections span the globe. More than three billion passengers travel on this network each year. Every day the passengers that travel this network accumulate a total of more than 14 billion kilometers, which is three times the radius of our solar system [10, 11] . Clearly this amount of global traffic shapes the way emergent infectious diseases can spread across the globe. One of the key challenges in epidemiology is preparing for eventual outbreaks and designing effective control measures. Evidence based control measures, however, require a good understanding of the fundamental features and characteristics of spreading behavior that all emergent infectious diseases share. In this context this means addressing questions such as: If there is an outbreak at Fig. 19.1 The global air-transportation network. Each node represents one of approx. 4000 airports, each link one of approx. 50000 direct connections between airports. More than 3 billion passengers travel on this network each year. All in all every day more than 16 billion km are traversed on this network, three times the radius of our solar system location X when should one expect the first case at a distant location Y? How many cases should one expect there? Given a local outbreak, what is the risk that a case will be imported in some distant country. How does this risk change over time? Also, emergent infectious diseases often spread in a covert fashion during the onset of an epidemic. Only after a certain number of cases are reported, public health scientists, epidemiologist and other professionals are confronted with cases that are scattered across a map and it is difficult to determine the actual outbreak origin. Therefore, a key question is also: Where is the geographic epicenter of an ongoing epidemic?",

In 1927 Kermack and McKenrick [12] introduced and analyzed the \"Suceptible-Infected-Recovered\" (SIR) model, a parsimoneous model for the description of a large class of infectious diseases that is also still in use today [13] . The SIR model considers a host population in which individuals can be susceptible (S), infectious (I) or recovered (R). Susceptible individuals can aquire a disease and become infectious themselves and transmit the disease to other susceptible individuals. After an infectious period individuals recover, acquire immunity, and no longer infect others. The SIR model is an abstract model that reduces a real world situation to the basic dynamic ingredients that are believed to shape the time course of a typical epidemic. Structurally, the SIR model treats individuals in a population in much the same way as chemicals that react in a wellmixed container. Chemical reactions between reactants occur at rates that depend on what chemicals are involved. It is assumed that all individuals can be represented only by their infectious state and are otherwise identical. Each pair of individuals has the same likelihood of interacting. Schematically, the SIR model is described by the following reactions",

The expected duration of being infected, the infectious period is given by T = \u22121 which can range from a few days to a few weeks for generic diseases. The ratio of rates R 0 = \u2215 is known as the basic reproduction ratio, i.e. the expected number of secondary infections caused by a single infected individual in a fully susceptible population. R 0 is the most important epidemiological parameter because the value of R 0 determines whether an infectious disease has the potential for causing an epidemic or not. When R 0 > 1 a small fraction of infected individuals in a susceptible population will cause an exponential growth of the number of infections. This epidemic rise will continue until the supply of susceptibles decreases to a level at which the epidemic can no longer be sustained. The increase in recovered and thus immune individuals dilutes the population and the epidemic dies out. Mathematically, one can translate the reaction scheme (19.1) into a set of ordinary differential equations. Say the population has N \u226b 1 individuals. For a small time interval \u0394t and a chosen susceptible individual the probability of that individual interacting with an infected is proportional to the fraction I\u2215N of infected individuals.

Figure 19 .3b depicts temporal snapshots of a simulation that is identical to the system of Fig. 19 .3a apart from a small but significant difference. In addition for infected sites to transmit the disease to neighboring susceptible lattice sites, every now and then (with a probability of 1%) they can also Fig. 19 .1) geographic distance to the initial outbreak location is no longer a good predictor of arrival time, unlike in systems with local or spatially limited host mobility infect randomly chosen lattice sites anywhere in the system. The propensity of infecting a lattice site at distance r decreases as an inverse power-law as explained in the caption to Fig. 19 .3. The possibility of transmitting to distant locations yields new epidemic seeds far away that subsequently turn into new outbreak waves and that in turn seed second, third, etc. generation outbreaks, even if the overall rate at which long-distance transmission occur is very small. The consequence of this is that the spatially coherent, concerntric pattern observed in the reaction diffusion system is lost, and a complex spatially incoherent, fractal pattern emerges [16] [17] [18] . Practically, this implies that the distance from an initial outbreak location can no longer be used as a measure for estimating or computing the time that it takes for an epidemic to arrive at a certain location. Also, given a snapshot of a spreading pattern, it is much more difficult to reconstruct the outbreak location from the geometry of the pattern alone, unlike in the concentric system where the outbreak location is typically near the center of mass of the pattern. A visual inspection of the air-transportation system depicted in Fig. 19 .1 is sufficiently convincing that the significant fraction of long-range connections in global mobility will not only increase the speed at which infectious diseases spread but, more importantly, also cause the patterns of spread to exhibit high spatial incoherence and complexity caused by the intricate connectivity of the air-transportation network. As a consequence we can no longer use geographic distance to an emergent epidemic epicenter as an indicator or measure of \"how far away\" that epicenter is and how long it will take to travel to a given location on the globe. This type of decorrelation is shown in Fig. 19.4 for two examples: The 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic. On a spatial resolution of countries, the figure depicts scatter plots of the epidemic arrival time as a function of geodesic (shortest distance on the surface of the Earth) distance from the initial outbreak location. As expected, the correlation between distance and arrival time is weak.",

For example N n could correspond to the size of city n and F nm the amount of passengers the travel by air from m to n.

Implementing a lot of dynamical detail, it is difficult to identify which factors are essential for an observed phenomenon and which factors are marginal. Because of the complexity that is often incorporated even at the beginning of the design of a sophisticated model in combination with the lack of data modelers often have to make assumptions about the numerical values of parameters that are required for running a computer simulation [26] . Generically many dozens of unknown parameters exist for which plausible and often not evidence-based values have to be assumed.

In these situations, when computational models from a practical point of view are needed most, little is known about these parameters and running even the most sophisticated models \"in the dark\" is problematic.

            "text": "In a recent approach Brockmann and Helbing [11] developed the idea of replacing the traditional geographic distance by the notion of an effective distance derived from the topological structure of the global air-transportation network. In essence the idea is very simple: If two locations in the air-transportation network exchange a large number of passengers they should be effectively close because a larger number of passengers implies that the probability of an infectious disease to be transmitted from A to B is comparatively larger than if these two locations were coupled only by a small number of traveling passengers. Effective distance should therefore decrease with traffic flux. What is the appropriate mathematical relation and a plausible ansatz to relate traffic flux to effective distance? To answer this question one can go back to the metapopulation SIR model, i.e. Eq. (19.12) . Dispersal in this equation is governed by the flux fraction P nm . Recall that this quantity is the fraction of all passengers that leave node m and arrive at node n. Therefore P nm can be operationally defined as the probability of a randomly chosen passenger departing node m arriving at node n. If, in a thought experiment, we assume that the randomly selected person is infectious, P nm is proportional to the probability of transmitting a disease from airport m to airport n. We can now make the following ansatz for the effective distance: (19.13) where d 0 \u2265 0 is a non-negative constant to be specified later. This definition of effective distance implies that if all traffic from m arrives at n and thus P nm = 1 the effective distance is d nm = d 0 which is the smallest possible value. If, on the other hand P nm becomes very small, d nm becomes larger as required. The definition (19.13) applies to nodes m and n that are connected by a link in the network. What about pairs of nodes that are not directly connected but only by paths that require intermediate steps? Given two arbitrary nodes, an origin m and a destination n, an infinite amount of paths (sequence of steps) exist that connect the two nodes. We can define the shortest effective route as the one for which the accumulation of effective distances along the legs is minimal. So for any path we sum the effective distance along the legs according to Eq. (19.13) adding up to an effective distance D nm . This approach also explains the use of the logarithm in the definition of effective distance. Adding effective distances along a route implies the multiplication of the probabilities P nm along the involved steps. Therefore the shortest effective distance D nm is equivalent to the most probable path that connect origin and destination. The parameter d 0 is a free parameter in the definition and quantifies the influence of the number of steps involved in a path. Typically it is chosen to be either 0 or 1 depending on the application.",

Let's assume A is a large hub that is strongly connected to many other airports in the network, including B. Airport B, however, is only a small airport with only as a single connection leading to A. The effective distance B \u2192 A is much smaller (equal to d 0 ) than the effective distance from the hub A to the small airport B. This accounts for the fact that if, again in a thought experiment, a randomly chosen passenger at airport B is most definitely going to A whereas a randomly chosen passenger at the hub A is arriving at B only with a small probability. Given the definition of effective distance one can compute the shortest effective paths to every other node from a chosen and fixed reference location. Each airport m thus has a set of shortest paths P m that connect m to all other airports. This set forms the shortest path tree T m of airport m. Together with the effective distance matrix D nm the tree defines the perspective of node m.

The radial distance of all the other airports in the network is proportional to their effective distance from TXL. One can see that large European hubs are effectively close to TXL as expected. However, also large Asian and American airports are effectively close to TXL. For example the airports of Chicago (ORD), Beijing (PEK), Miami (MIA) and New York (JFK) are comparatively close to TXL. We can also see that from the perspective of TXL, Germany's largest airport FRA serves as a gateway to a considerable fraction of the rest of the world.

This has important consequences. Because only the topological features of the network are used for computing the effective distance and no dynamic features are required, the concentricy of the emergent patterns are a generic feature and independent of dynamical properties of the underlying model. It also means that in effective distance, contagion processes spread at a constant speed, and just like in the simple reaction diffusion model one can much better predict the arrival time of an epidemic wavefront, knowing the speed and effective distance. For example if shortly after an epidemic outbreak the spreading commences and the initial spreading speed is assessed, one can forecast arrival times without having to run computationally expensive simulations. Even if the spreading speed is unknown, the Shortest path trees and effective distance from the perspective of airport Tegel (TXL) in Berlin. TXL is the central node. Radial distance in the tree quantifies the effective distance to the reference node TXL. As expected large European hubs like Frankfurt (FRA), Munich (MUC) and London Heathrow (LHR) are effective close to TXL. However, also hubs that are geographically distant such as Chicago (ORD) and Beijing (PEK) are effectively closer than smaller European airports. Note also that the tree structure indicates that FRA is a gateway to a large fraction of other airports as reflected by the size of the tree branch at FRA.

            "text": "In a number of situation epidemiologists are confronted with the task of reconstructing the outbreak origin of an epidemic. When a novel pathogen emerges in some cases the infection spreads covertly until a substantial case count attracts attention and public health officials and experts become aware of the situation. Quite often cases occur much like the patterns depicted in Fig. 19 .3b in a spatially incoherent way because of the complexity of underlying human mobility networks. When cases emerge at apparently randomly distributed locations it is a difficult task to assess where the event initially started. The computational method based on effective distance can also be employed in these situations provided that one knows the underlying mobility network. This is because the concentric pattern depicted in Fig. 19 .10 is . Compared to the conventional use of geographic distance effective distance is a much better predictor of epidemic arrival time as is reflected by the linear relationship between arrival time and effective distance, e.g. compare to Fig. 19 .7. Right: The same analysis for the 2003 SARS epidemic. Also in this case effective distance is much more strongly correlated with arrival time than geographic distance only observed if and only if the actual outbreak location is chosen as the center perspective node. In other words, if the temporal snapshots are depicted using a different reference node the concentric pattern is scrambled and irregular. Therefore, one can use the effective distance method to identify the outbreak location of a spreading process based on a single temporal snapshot. This method is illustrated in a proofof-concept example depicted in Fig. 19 .12. Assume that we are given a temporal snapshot of a spreading process as depicted in Fig. 19 .12a and the goal is to reconstruct the outbreak origin from the data. Conventional geometric considerations are not sucessful because the network-driven processes generically do not yields simple geometric patterns. Using effective distance, we can now investigate the pattern from the perspective of every single potential outbreak location. We could for example pick a set of candidate outbreak locations (panel (b) in the figure). If this is done we will find that only for one candidate outbreak location the temporal snapshot has the shape of a concentric circle. This must be the original outbreak location. This process, qualitatively depicted in the figure, can be applied in a quantitative way and has been applied to actual epidemic data such as the 2011 EHEC outbreak in Germany [28] .",
