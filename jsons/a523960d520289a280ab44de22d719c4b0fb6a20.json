Given that the disease has not approved vaccines or drugs up to now, any efforts for drug design and or clinical trails of old drugs based on their mechanism of action are worthy and creditable in such circumstances. Experienced docking experiments using the newly released coordinate structure for COVID-19 protease as a receptor and thoughtfully selected chemicals among antiviral and antibiotics drugs as ligands may be leading in this context. We selected nine drugs from HIV-1 protease inhibitors and twenty-one candidates from anti bronchitis drugs based on their chemical structures and enrolled them in blind and active site-directed dockings in different modes and in native-like conditions of interactions. Our findings suggest the binding capacity and the inhibitory potency of candidates are as follows Tipranavir\uf020\uf03eIndinavir\uf03eAtazanavir\uf03eDarunavir\uf03eRitonavir\uf03eAmprenavir for HIV-1 protease inhibitors and Cefditoren\uf03eCefixime\uf03eErythromycin\uf03eClarithromycin for anti bronchitis medicines. The drugs bioavailability, their hydrophobicity and the hydrophobic properties of their binding sites and also the rates of their metabolisms and deactivations in the human body are the next determinants for their overall effects on viral infections, the net results that should survey by clinical trials to assess their therapeutic usefulness for coronavirus infections.",

These changes in COVID-19 protease sequence may lead to the different global architecture of protein and especially in its binding or catalytic site, in such a way the localization of binding sites in COVID-19 shifted to neighbors' residues contrast to that's of SARS protease.",

Table 1 represents the binding site residues for SARS and COVID-19 protease. As it is evident there is only three residues similarity between two enzymes at positions 140-142 different amino acid constituent and geometry expectedly need different inhibitors with different stereochemistry. Based on this fact it is necessary to search for different inhibitors for coronavirus, the investigation that is the main topic of this study. In the next step, we carried out active site-directed docking of the selected ligands in ArgusLab software to study the binding capacity of ligands to fit the active site. The binding energies obtained from our docking our blind and active site-directed experiments are shown in table 2. Pearson's two-tailed test of correlation was performed between blind and active site-directed docking reveals that there is no significant correlation between blind and site-directed energies (p-value >.05) and this means that the mechanisms underlie the interactions between ligand and protease is not the same and these two energies are completely independent variables and could be sums for comparative purpose. Figure 3 shows the total binding energies for ligands during our experiments. Based on our findings and as it is clear Tipranavir seems to be the most potent inhibitor for COVID-19 protease. Clinical trials reveal that Tipranavir is capable of viruses' replication in patients resistant to other protease inhibitors and resistance against this drug needs multiple mutations to take place simultaneously in protease genes [22] .",

Corona sequence is highlighted in yellow color Accordingly, the mutations in COVID-19 expectedly exert structural changes that may affect enzyme binding site position and functional group constituents. As shown in table 1 the mutations move the biding site to preceding residues in COVID-19 contrast to SARS protease, far from the binding site of SARS and hence the inhibitors for SARS should not affect on COVID-19 protease. Given the fact that active site residues placed at flexible or hot points of the protein chain, we extracted the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) plot of COBID-19 and SARS protease (Figure 1) molecular dynamic simulation trajectory and plot it as RMSD in nanometer per residues numbers. Residues with higher RMSF comprise the hot or flexible points. As it is shown most residues of COVID-19 active site (table 1) placed predominantly in the 140-192 region, while that's of SARS localized in 290-303 regions. This finding reconfirms our claim regarding the COVID-19 active site.",

To increase Darunavir efficacy, it is used in accordance with one of the other retroviral drugs as Reitonavir or cobicistat to treat HIV-1 infectious [37-38]. The drug binds strongly to enzyme active site via multiple hydrogen with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 4.5 \u00d710\u221212 M, which is much stronger than that's of other protease inhibitors [39]. It is very important to notice that the hydrogen bonds are formed between Darunavir and enzyme backbone and so they did not affected by mutations in protease sequence because the backbone does not affected by sequence and then the inhibitory potency of Darunavir does not disrupted by viral mutations in new generations of viruses",

In this study, we calculate the hydrophobic index for enzyme active site residues based on Kyte & Doolittle method and report them as hydrophobic index per residue for reasonable comparison[20]. The Hydrophobicity indexes for drugs were calculated as LogP on the Virtual Computational Chemistry Laboratory server (http://www.vcclab.org/)[21].Data Handling and Analysis: all the numerical data were exploited in Excel and SPSS software. P-value under .05 was considered as the significance level.Sequence alignment for COVID-19 and SARS proteases, scheme 1, performed on EMBOSS Stretcher (www.ebi.ac.uk) reviled a single deletion at position 144 (Cys) in COVID-19 protease contrast to SARS ones and also there are twelve mutations along COVID-19 protease along it sequence stretch as depicted in scheme 1 shown by single our double dots instead of vertical line.",

The more similarity in binding site to the enzyme active site cavity causes the more inhibitory effects of drugs on enzyme activity. Among the drugs, Amprenavir exhibits maximum similarity while Darunavir, Dicloxacillin, and Doxycycline show the minimum similarity in their binding site constituents with the enzyme active site. We hypothesize that the binding site similarity for drugs should play determinant roles in their inhibitory potency. Hydrophobicity of drugs binding sites also accelerates their binding in aqueous conditions and we think that the more hydrophobic index for each drug guarantees prominent inhibitory behavior. Atazanavir and Amprenavir based on these criteria should exhibit the most and the less inhibitory character. Finally, LogP calculation for drugs reveals that Tipranavir, Atazanavir, and Ritonavir among anti-HIV-1 drugs and Dicloxacillin, Clarithromycin and Erythromycin among bronchitis drugs manifest the highest hydrophobic properties.",
