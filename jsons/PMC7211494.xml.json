Of the six WHO regions, the European region is the most affected by non-communicable disease (NCD)-related morbidity and mortality3 and the growth of the NCDs is concerning. Cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes are among the leading causes of death and disability in the region,3 and an increasing proportion of children and adults are living with overweight or obesity,4 one of the major risk factors for NCDs. Prevention and control of NCDs are important during this pandemic because NCDs are major risk factors for patients with COVID-19.5 Additionally, some of the restrictive measures such as lockdowns, social distancing, and travel restrictions to reduce the spread of infection in many countries impact specifically on people living with NCDs by limiting their activity, ability to secure healthy foods, and access to preventive or health promotion services.6\n",

Physical distancing or quarantine can lead to poor management of NCD behavioural risk factors, including unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and harmful use of alcohol.13 Evidence from this and previous pandemics suggests that without proper management, chronic conditions can worsen due to stressful situations resulting from restrictions, insecure economic situations, and changes in normal health behaviours. As with other health service and preventive programmes, the postponement of routine medical appointments and tests can delay NCD management, while physical distancing, restricted access to primary health care units, pharmacies, and community services, alongside a reduction of transport links, all disrupt continuity of care for NCD patients. This disruption of routine health services and medical supplies risks increasing morbidity, disability, and avoidable mortality over time in NCD patients. Additionally, patients with severe obesity who require intensive care have increased patient management needs.6\n",
