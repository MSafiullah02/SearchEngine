            "text": "Background The Forrest classification is widely applied to guide endoscopic hemostasis for peptic ulcer bleeding. Accordingly, practice guidelines suggest medical treatment only for ulcer with a Forrest IIc lesion because it has low rebleeding risk even without endoscopic therapy, ranging from 0 to 13%. However, the risk ranges widely and it is unclear who is at risk of rebleeding with such a lesion. This study assessed whether the Rockall score, which evaluates patients holistically, could indicate the risk of recurrent bleeding among patients with a Forrest IIc lesion at the second-look endoscopy. Methods Patients who had peptic ulcer bleeding with Ia-IIb lesions received endoscopic hemostasis at the primary endoscopy, and they were enrolled if their Ia-IIb lesions had been fading to IIc at the second-look endoscopy after 48-to 72-h intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) infusion. Primary outcomes were rebleeding during the 4th-14th day and 4 th -28th day after the first bleeding episode. Results The prospective cohort study enrolled 140 patients, who were divided into a Rockall scores \u2265 6 group or a Rockall scores < 6 group. The rebleeding rates in the Rockall scores \u2265 6 group and the Rockall scores < 6 group during the 4th-14th day and the 4th-28th day were 13/70 (18.6%) versus 2/70 (2.9%), p = 0.003 and 17/70 (24.3%) versus 3/70 (4.3%), p = 0.001, respectively, based on an intention-to-treat analysis and 5/62 (8.1%) versus 0/68 (0%), p = 0.023 and 6/59 (10.2%) versus 0/67 (0%), p = 0.009, respectively, based on a per-protocol analysis. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the Rockall scores \u2265 6 group had a significantly lower cumulative rebleeding-free proportion than the Rockall scores < 6 group (p = 0.01). Conclusions Combined Rockall scores \u2265 6 on arrival with a Forrest IIc lesion at the second-look endoscopy can identify patients at risk of recurrent peptic ulcer bleeding following initial endoscopic and intravenous PPI treatment.

            "text": "There are many factors correlated with the risk of recurrent bleeding in peptic ulcers, including endoscopic features and clinical parameters. The Forrest classification based on the endoscopic feature predicts recurrent bleeding (Table 1 ) [2] . In contrast to ulcers with the Forrest Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb lesions, the risk of recurrent bleeding in ulcers with the IIc lesion without endoscopic therapy has been shown to be only 0-13% [3] . However, it is uncertain what kind of patient is at increased risk of recurrent bleeding if the features show the IIc lesion. Previous studies showed that patients with comorbidities experience an increased risk of recurrent bleeding even when they receive endoscopic hemostasis and intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy [4] [5] [6] . The Rockall scoring system, which includes endoscopic features and clinical parameters, has been used to evaluate patients holistically and to predict recurrent bleeding and mortality from peptic ulcers (Table 1) [7] . Table 1 The criteria of the Forrest classification [2, 3] and the Rockall score [7] a We modified the diagnostic criteria of comorbidities as follows to make this variable clearer to be scored than it was according to the old criteria b Cardiac failure included congestive heart failure with New York Heart Association Function I to IV c Any major comorbidity included lung disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonia, or empyema), chronic kidney disease stage III (estimated glomerular filtration rates between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, newonset cerebrovascular accident, intensive care unit stay, mechanical ventilator support for > 24 h, or any major surgery (on the central nervous system, thorax, abdomen, long bones or spinal bones) within 14 days prior to bleeding d Liver failure included liver cirrhosis, Child-Pugh A, B, or C e Renal failure included chronic kidney disease stage IV (estimated glomerular filtration rates between 15 and 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), stage V (estimated glomerular filtration rates < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) with or without maintenance dialysis, or acute kidney injury with estimated glomerular filtration rates < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [8] [9] [10] . Studies have also shown that patients' Rockall scores are often \u2265 6 in those with comorbidities, who also exhibit an increased risk of recurrent peptic ulcer bleeding [11, 12] . Therefore, we propose that patients with Rockall scores \u2265 6 are still at risk of recurrent bleeding after initial treatment partially because of impaired tissue healing, which results in delayed fading out of the Forrest lesions.",

There are endoscopic features proven to be correlated with an increased risk of recurrent bleeding, including gastric ulcer, ulcer size, the Forrest classification, gastroscopic therapy, and the ulcer location, where the efficacy of endoscopic hemostasis is limited [18] . In this study, the endoscopic features of the patients at the primary endoscopy were similar between the two groups, with the exception of gastric ulcers and the Forrest classification (Table 3 ). All enrolled patients received endoscopic hemostasis at the primary endoscopy to treat their major SRH according to clinical practice guidelines [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] and all of the major SRH had been fading to the Forrest IIc lesion after intravenous PPI infusion for 48-72 h.

The Rockall scoring system includes endoscopic and clinical variables (Table 1) . This study enrolled patients all of whom had score 3 for the endoscopic variables at the primary endoscopy (Table 2) . Specifically, the clinical Rockall scores were \u2265 3 for patients who were at risk of recurrent bleeding. Our results suggested a rationale of doubling the oral PPI dose to 14 days or prolonging intravenous PPI infusion to 7 days in patients with Rockall scores \u2265 6 or clinical Rockall scores \u2265 3 [11, 20] . We conducted this study based on contemporary strategies; thus, the results could be generalizable to current clinical practice.",

Importantly, these suggestions are based on the risk of recurrent bleeding stratified by the Forrest classification, which evaluates endoscopic features only. Our results are highly original in terms of showing an increased risk of recurrent bleeding among patients with both Rockall scores \u2265 6 on arrival and a Forrest IIc lesion at the secondlook endoscopy and suggest a potential indication to apply endoscopic therapy tailored to such a patient. A previous study showed that pre-emptive PPI before endoscopy accelerates the resolution of SRH but does not decrease the risk of recurrent bleeding; however, endoscopic therapy for ulcers with the Forrest IIc was not performed in that study [21] . Our findings provide new insights into who may be indicated for endoscopic therapy for ulcers with the Forrest IIc lesion after pre-emptive PPI.",

            "text": "The reasons why the Rockall score \u2265 6 is so predictive are uncertain. An imbalance between aggressive factors and the defensive mechanisms is responsible for peptic ulcers [22] . In this study, patients with Rockall scores \u2265 6 were older, had comorbidities, or had higher rates of hemodynamic instability on arrival (p < 0.05); however, they had lower rates of H. pylori infection than those with Rockall scores < 6 (p = 0.03, Table 2 ). These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of peptic ulcers in patients with Rockall scores \u2265 6 may be due to an impaired defensive mechanism, i.e., the mucus-bicarbonate barrier, more than aggressive factors, i.e., H. pylori [22] [23] [24] . The secretion of mucus gel and bicarbonate is essential to maintain the mucus-bicarbonate barrier [25, 26] , but it is impaired because the perfusion in the gastroduodenal mucosa is compromised in patients with senility, comorbidity, or hemodynamic instability [8, 27] . Mucus and bicarbonate secretions are regulated by prostaglandins [28] ; thus, a study of the role of prostaglandins in peptic ulcer disease in patients with Rockall scores \u2265 6 would be a promising direction for future studies. Although the reasons are uncertain, endoscopists could evaluate patients who are at risk of recurrent bleeding more holistically by using the Rockall score than by using the Forrest classification.",
