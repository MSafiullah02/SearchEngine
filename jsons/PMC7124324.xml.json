A validation study is currently under way in Taiwan. Second, the predictive ability could also be affected by the incidence of other infectious disease at the time. Third, until now the diagnosis of SARS was based mainly on clinical grounds.2 The SARS status of our cohort could be altered when newer serologic or microbiologic tests become available. Finally, score systems based on reported symptoms are subject to recall bias. However, we believe our training of interviewers and the use of a structured questionnaire would minimize such concerns.",
