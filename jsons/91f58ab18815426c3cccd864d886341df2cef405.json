The Joint Commission defines a sentinel event as an unexpected occurrence resulting in death or serious physical or psychological injury, or the risk thereof (1) . Conventionally identified sentinel events, such as unintended retention of foreign objects and fall-related events, are used to evaluate quality in hospital care. Similarly, disparate AA COVID-19 mortality reflects longstanding, unacceptable U.S. racial/ethnic and socioeconomic CVD inequities and unmasks system failures and unacceptable care to be caught and mitigated. While it is unclear if AAs are infected more often, ssocial determinants of health are powerful predictors of COVID-19 infectivity and mortality. The impact of COVID-19 goes well beyond the viral infection itself, reflecting the dynamics of a long-standing adverse host-environment, including access to limited resources (i.e., money, food, education, healthcare, job flexibility), making disadvantaged communities more vulnerable in the pandemic.

People of color are not genetically nor biologically predisposed to get COVID-19, but are socially prone to coronavirus exposure and have higher incidence of the very co-morbidities fueling complications. Notably, minorities are more likely to be uninsured compared to non-Hispanic whites, and uninsured adults are less likely to have CVD risks controlled. The comorbidities that make COVID-19 more deadly are linked to the segregation and concentrated poverty that still mark these disparate communities. Hence, maintenance and continuity of CVD care during this crisis is absolutely required.",

Disturbingly, higher mortality from COVID-19 has been locally documented in AA populations from New Orleans, LA, Chicago, IL, Milwaukee, WI and Detroit, MI and even rural Albany, GA. For example, 70% of the people who have died from coronavirus in Louisiana are black, a striking disparity for a state where AAs make up only 32% of the population (http://ldh.la.gov/coronavirus, accessed APR 13, 2020). Similarly, AAs compromise 14% of the population in Michigan, but represent 40% of COVID-19 deaths, and like LA, Michigan recently formed a task force to tackle racial COVID-19 disparities (KFF, 2020). The top 3 underlying conditions among COVID-19 LA deaths are hypertension (59.76%), diabetes (38.10%) and chronic kidney disease (22.50%) (8).

(2) A toxic gumbo of CVD and environment profoundly diminishes overall AA life expectancy. Unfortunately, diminished AA life expectancy predates the COVID-19 pandemic for decades (3). The 1985 landmark Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health documented higher racial/ethnic mortality rates, and called such disparities \"an affront both to our ideals and to the ongoing genius of American medicine.\" Despite some progress, the groundbreaking Report's national goal of reducing and eventually eliminating racial/ethnic disparities has not been realized. Primarily impacted by CVD mortality, in 2017, the life expectancy for white females was 81.0 years compared to 78.1 years for black females and 76.1 to 71.5 years for males (Figure 1).",

In addition, the Association of Black Cardiologists (ABC), with its long history of combating disparities, has initiated efforts to educate clinicians and the public about the pandemic's effect in AAs diaspora and other under-served groups. Ultimately, to stave off future unnecessary loss of life, the COVID-19 crisis must be seen as an opportunity to finally fully address CVD disparities and the underlying structural factors. \"Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and inhuman.\" Dr. Martin Luther King (March 25, 1966, the Medical Committee for Human Rights) FIGURE LEGENDS Life expectancy, by race and Hispanic origin and sex: United States, 2006-2017 Arias E, Xu J.
