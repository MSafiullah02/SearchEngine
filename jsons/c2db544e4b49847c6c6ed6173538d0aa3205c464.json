Networks analysis, e.g. [1] , proposes mechanisms for the spreading of contagion and the existence of super spreaders, a plausible joint cause of fat tails. Likewise simple automata processes can lead to high uncertainty of outcomes owing to \"computational irreducibility\" [28] . 2 More technically, a non-negative continuous random variable X has a fattailed distribution (in the maximum domain of attraction of the Fr\u00e9chet distribution), if its survival function is regularly varying, i.e. S( [9] .

Such a plot relies on a simple consequence of the law of large numbers: for a sequence X 1 , X 2 , ..., X n of nonnegative i.i.d. random variables, if E[X p ] < \u221e for p = 1, 2, 3..., then R p n = M p n /S p n \u2192 a.s. 0 as n \u2192 \u221e, where S p n = n i=1 X p i is the partial sum of order p, and M p n = max(X p 1 , ..., X p n ) the corresponding partial maximum. Figure 1 clearly shows that no finite moment is likely to exist for the number of victims in pandemics, as the R n ratio does not converge to 0 for p = 1, 2, 3, 4, no matter how many data points we use. Such a behavior hints that the victims distribution has such a fat right tail that not even the first theoretical moment is finite. We are looking at a phenomenon for which observed quantities such as the naive sample average and standard deviation are therefore meaningless for inference. However, Figure 1 (or a naive use of EVT) does not imply that pandemic risk is actually infinite and there is nothing we can do or model. Using the methodology we developed to study war casualties [4] , [20] , we are in fact able to extract useful information from the data, quantifying the large yet finite risk of pandemic diseases. The method provides in fact rough estimates for quantities not immediately observable in the data.",

If one only observes values up to M << H, and more or less consciously ignores the existence of H, one could be fooled by the data into believing that the tail is actually the continuous one, the so-called apparent tail [5] . The tails are indeed indistinguishable for most cases, virtually in all finite samples, as the divergence is only clear in the vicinity of H. A bounded tail with very large upper limit is therefore mistakenly taken for an unbounded one, and no model will be able to see the difference, even if epistemologically we are in two extremely different situations. This is the typical case in which critical reasoning, and the a priori analysis of the characteristics of the phenomenon under scrutiny, should precede any instinctive and uncritical fitting of the data. A solution is the approach of [4] , [5] , which introduces the concept of dual data via a special log-transformation 10 . The basic idea is to find a way of matching naive extrapolations (apparently infinite moments) with correct modelling.",

For actual data we get a shadow mean of 20.1M, which is definitely larger (almost 1.5 times) than the corresponding sample tail mean of 13.9M (this is the mean of all the actual numbers above the 200K threshold.). Combining the shadow mean with the sample mean below the 200K threshold, we get an overall mean of 7M instead of the naive 4.9M we have computed initially. It is therefore important to stress that a naive use of the sample mean would induce an underestimation of risk, and would also be statistically incorrect.

Figure 7 contains the histogram of the \u03be parameter over the 10K distorted copies of the dual numbers.
