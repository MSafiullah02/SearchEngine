Despite the heterogeneity of data, we were instead struck by finding at the onset of pneumonia an excess of SP-B, with respect to PL. It is possible that SP-B excess represents \u201cspent surfactant\u201d, that could contribute with factors, like a leak of plasma proteins in the alveolar space (2), or SP-C deficiency (18), to the decreased lung compliance observed at the onset of the pneumonia. The observed SP-B excess could, however, be explained by other mechanisms like increased secretion of SP-B, a slower clearance or a combination of these mechanisms. Finally, it is possible that the excess of SP-B may reflect an accumulation of surfactant subfractions particularly enriched in SP-B (19). The decrease of the SP-B (%PL) ratio along with clinical and respiratory improvements, were reasonably related with a better oxygenation status, which may represent the result of an improved clearance or a decreased secretion of SP-B.Our data are in line with previous results obtained both in animal studies (20,21) and in newborns after lung injury (22,23). Ikegami et al. (20) found that in healthy mice (with normal lungs) the induction of lung injury by the intratracheal injection of LPS resulted in an increase of DSPC and SP-B, mediated by STAT-3, which is consistent with an acute response to the lung injury. Moreover, our research group observed how, in a murine model of unilateral lung injury, DSPC-palmitate synthesis was faster both in the injured and in the noninjured lungs, compared to the na\u00efve control lungs. In this way we proved that, after a local instillation of acid in one bronchus, it is the entire lung system that is involved in responding to the damage and not only a local area of the lung (21). Other mechanisms may have contributed to the elevation of SP-B levels. Increased expression of SPs has been observed both in animals exposed to high levels of inspired oxygen (24) and in mechanically ventilated ones (25), however we hypothesised that a main role could have been played by the infection and be mediated by STAT-3 pathway.",

At the end of the study, after the removal of the arterial line, we could not express SPs as ELF, because ethical concerns precluded invasive and unnecessary procedures, such as the collection of plasma to correct for surfactant dilution. We therefore chose to express SPs values as % of PL because the amount of total PL recovered from TAs did not significantly differ from the start to the end of the study both in the pneumonia and in the control groups (pneumonia: 0.14 (0.07\u20130.25) and 0.17 (0.09\u20130.97) mg/ml, P = 0.110; controls: 0.50 (0.20\u20130.75) and 0.39 (0.06\u20130.56) mg/ml, P = 0.237). This implied that they did not affect the SPs (%PL) ratio and they did not introduce a bias in the comparison within the study groups. A previous study performed in adults with pneumonia, ARDS, or cardiogenic edema showed that in adults with pneumonia the BALF PL and phosphatidylcholine (PC) content were not significantly different compared with controls (2). It is conceivable that the TAs unsaturated-PC derived from inflammatory cells may have contributed to mantain the same amount of TAs PL content in our newborns with pneumonia together with the increase of other surfactant PL classes, either than the sole DSPC (13). Regarding SP-A (%PL) ratio, Dargaville et al. (10) expressed SP-A content as weight/volume of ELF, and as opposed to our study, they found that ELF SP-A in infants with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis was, at the peak of the disease, significantly lower compared to controls. This conflicting finding can be explained by the different etiology of the disease or by the fact that they measured ELF SP-A in infants with gestational age ranging between 24\u201341 wk.",
