Camel milk as a food-borne source seems unlikely.8\n",

We previously presented the first validated recombinant ELISA (rELISA) for MERS-CoV and combined this test with recombinant immunofluorescence assay (rIFA) and a plaque reduction virus neutralisation test (PRNT) into a staged strategy for MERS-CoV serology that was shown to identify even subclinical infections on detection of specific antibodies.12 Here, we apply the established testing algorithm on a nationwide serum collection.

The true number of infections is difficult to estimate because our sample consisted of only 10 009 (0\u00b703%) of the whole population of 29 994 300 people. However, by combining two cross-sectional subcohorts we could cover all 13 provinces and achieved an age distribution of our sample that largely matched that of the general population (panel\n). All geographical regions of the country were sampled with a reasonably low variation in the proportions of population that were studied per province. To have optimum sample coverage per province, we included samples from an earlier study (unpublished report) for which detailed information about sex and age was not available for 26% of samples. Nevertheless, samples from both subcohorts should be similar in age and sex composition because both were previously obtained according to calculations by the National Census Bureau to represent the composition of the Saudi Arabian population. This similarity was lent support by the highly similar seroprevalence when we analysed both subcohorts separately. Even if we had only used data from the more thoroughly documented burden-of-disease study subcohort for which we had sex and age information for 97% of the samples, the overall seroprevalence would have been maintained (0\u00b715% in the overall sample vs 0\u00b714% in the subcohort).PanelResearch in context\nSystemic review\nWe searched PubMed with the terms \u201chuman coronavirus EMC\u201d or \u201cMERS-CoV\u201d and identified 463 English-language reports published before Jan 20, 2015. Two previous studies14, 15 reported an absence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) antibodies in a few cohorts of serum samples obtained in Saudi Arabia from 2010 to 2012. One study investigated 266 individuals from the Eastern province.14 This study included 158 serum samples taken from children admitted to hospital for infections of the lower respiratory tract from May, 2010, to May, 2011, and 110 plasma samples from male blood donors taken during December, 2012. The other study15 assessed samples taken from 130 male blood donors from Jeddah during 2012 and 226 slaughterhouse workers in Jeddah and Makkah in October, 2012. No nationwide cross-sectional antibody surveys have been reported in any of the countries in the Middle East known to be affected by MERS-CoV, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, United Arabic Emirates, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, and Yemen.\nInterpretation\nWe did the first nationwide cross-sectional serosurvey for MERS-CoV antibodies in the population of Saudi Arabia to explore the putative presence of unrecorded MERS-CoV infections. We noted that 0\u00b715% of mainly male individuals in six of 13 had specific anti-MERS-CoV antibodies. Additionally, we identified a seroprevalence of MERS-CoV that was 15\u201323 times higher in camel-exposed individuals such as shepherds and slaughterhouse workers than in the general population. None of the individuals who tested positive for MERS-CoV antibodies had severe illness before or at the time of sampling. The mean age of all identified seroconverted individuals was significantly lower than that of patients with MERS admitted to hospital. In summary, our data suggest that middle-aged men with regular camel contact could sporadically introduce MERS-CoV into the general population. These subclinically infected individuals might represent the unknown source of infection for the many reported patients with MERS with no anamnestic camel exposure.",

Extrapolation by simple multiplication suggests that 44 951 seropositive individuals (95% CI 26 971\u201371 922) could exist in a total population of 29 994 300. Our serological assays might have missed some infections because the high specificity of rIFA and PRNT could encompass a reduction in sensitivity of the overall serological algorithm. However, even a projection based on rELISA results only would raise the estimated infection rate by about ten times, which is several orders of magnitude lower than figures expected for a respiratory disease that continuously transmits between human beings. In accordance with our previous study,12 seropositivity with rELISA was ten times higher than that with rIFA.12 This rise can be attributed to the higher sensitivity of rELISA and by putative crossreactivity of low-affinity IgG, which is raised in individuals with recent infections from the common-cold coronavirus.23\n",

Widespread acquisition of infections without subsequent causation of outbreaks corresponds to the concept of a predominantly zoonotic disease that does not readily spread between human beings. The raised prevalence in rural regions and the significantly increased proportion of infection in groups that are occupationally exposed to camels emphasises the importance of zoonotic acquisitions by dromedary camels.5, 6, 7 However, even though the analysed shepherd samples were collected in six different regions during the first months of 2014, the sampling was not randomised and samples were not strictly taken at the same time as those from the general population. Similar limitations apply for the slaughterhouse worker samples. Direct comparison of seroprevalences between these groups and the general population cohort might thus be biased. Matched case-control studies could be used to substantiate the raised seroprevalence in exposed groups.",

The younger age of serologically confirmed patients in our study compared with people with laboratory confirmed infection underlines the possibility that MERS-CoV might cause unrecognised infections that cause no or mild symptoms in healthy, younger (aged 15\u201344 years), and socially active populations. These subclinical infections could act as an unknown source for index patients who cannot recall contact with camels. Importantly, the predominance of men even within serologically confirmed cases emphasises a potential association with animal exposure because, typically, more men than women in Saudi Arabia associate with camels during leisure activities. Cases of MERS in younger people (aged <45 years) might seem mild or even subclinical, similar to cases in our study of household contact clusters,12 in which contacts were younger than index patients and mostly asymptomatic. MERS might constitute a zoonotic disease that causes enough short-transmission chains in the young male population of Saudi Arabia, for which older and predisposed individuals constitute a sentinel population.",
