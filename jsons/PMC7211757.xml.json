Some patients exhibit asymmetrical edematous lesions and atelectasis, or scattered fibrosis (Zhang et al., 2020). Given the low resolution of plain radiography, we recommend that chest CT be performed in all severe patients. However, unfortunately, CT scanning is not available in all emergency departments, and may require transfer of the patient to a radiology suite. Lung ultrasound is a developing technique which has been used extensively in ARDS patients over the last decades (Peng et al., 2020) and may be useful for safe, noninvasive bedside diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia; specific lung ultrasound patterns have been described (Peng et al., 2020). Nevertheless, this technique has several limitations, such as the need for formal training, interobserver variability, and limited accuracy (particularly in obese patients and in the presence of subcutaneous emphysema).",

In particular, chest CT scan can help in the assessment of areas of atelectasis or overperfusion and shunting, as well as evaluation of the risk of pulmonary embolism. We have identified three main chest CT patterns in COVID-19 patients, representing three different phenotypes: 1) multiple, focal, possibly overperfused ground-glass opacities mainly in the subpleural region; 2) inhomogeneously distributed atelectasis and peribronchial opacities; and 3) a patchy ARDS-like pattern. These differing phenotypes are attributable to different pathophysiological mechanisms, and therefore require different ventilatory strategies; however, the phenotypes we propose seem to be in agreement with Gattinoni et al.(Gattinoni et al., 2020a)(Gattinoni et al., 2020b), who proposed a phenotype L (low elastance, low ventilation to perfusion ratio, and low lung reclutability) compatible with our phenotype 1, a phenotype H (high elastance, and simil ARDS pattern), compatible with our phenotype 3, and a transitioning phenotype, which reflects the evolution of the disease.",

Few data are available on the efficacy of noninvasive support\u2014which includes continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), noninvasive ventilation (NIV), and high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO)\u2014in COVID-19 pneumonia. In patients with influenza A(H1N1) infection, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation was associated with a high incidence of failure (57-85%), and patients who failed noninvasive support experienced a higher mortality rate than those treated with early mechanical ventilation (Kumar et al., 2009)24]. The experience in COVID-19 patients from Wuhan was similar, with a high rate of noninvasive support failure and need for intubation and mechanical ventilation in 76% of cases; nevertheless, there was no difference in mortality between patients receiving noninvasive vs invasive ventilation (Yang et al., 2020). In general, noninvasive ventilatory management carries a high risk of generating negative (and unmeasured) intrathoracic pressures, and is thus potentially counterproductive (Brochard et al., 2017). Noninvasive support also presents a higher risk of viral spread through mask leaks, with increased risk of transmission (Fig. 2\n). Furthermore, delayed intubation increases the risk of clinical deterioration and the need for emergency airway management. In general ICU patients, HFNO has been shown to decrease the need for tracheal intubation in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure when compared to conventional oxygen therapy, without impacting mortality (Rochwerg et al., 2019). A randomized controlled trial comparing NIV and HFNO in patients with hypoxic respiratory failure showed that HFNO was able to reduce mortality at 90 days without affecting the need for intubation (50% vs 47%, p = 0.18) (Frat et al., 2015), while a meta-analysis comparing HFNO vs NIV demonstrated that HFNO is able to significantly decrease the need for intubation (Ni et al., 2018). Therefore, in adults with COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure, HFNO should be preferred over NIV. Both NIV and HFNO are being used extensively in COVID-19 patients, especially in cases of milder disease or to buy time before invasive ventilation is commenced. However, the potential advantages of using NIV or HFNO in these circumstances have to be balanced against their risks. When a patient presents with severe respiratory failure or on a downward spiral that suggests intubation will be inevitable, noninvasive respiratory support should not be attempted [22].",

Hypoxemic respiratory failure and need for invasive ventilation should be considered when patients receiving standard oxygen therapy exhibit tachypnea (> 30 bpm) and hypoxemia (SpO2 < 90% or partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) < 60 mmHg) with oxygen administered via a facemask and reservoir bag (gas flow of 10\u223c15 L/min, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 0.60\u20130.95). Similarly, when a patient under HFNO support with FiO2 >70% and gas flow >50 L/min or NIV experiences persistent respiratory failure or deteriorates acutely, mechanical ventilation should be promptly initiated (Jin et al., 2020). Fig. 3\npresents our algorithm for trialing CPAP and indications for centralization and intubation of patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure. According to our experience, phenotype 1 is likely to be found when patients are promptly intubated and receive only brief or no noninvasive respiratory support. Patients who receive prolonged noninvasive ventilation are likely to develop phenotype 2 or 3, thus becoming more difficult to ventilate, with lower compliance and worse deterioration of oxygenation.",

Airway devices, venous access devices, anesthetics, suction, ventilators, and basic monitoring should be guaranteed and readily available before starting. A rapid difficult-airway assessment should be done to recognize those at risk for difficult airway management. Intubation should be performed by the most experienced clinician, with the help of another doctor, and the most familiar airway device should be the first choice for intubating (Zuo et al., 2020). Preoxygenation with 100% FiO2 for 5 minutes before induction of anesthesia could be useful. Pre-oxygenation should be performed, using a well-fitting occlusive face mask attached to a manual ventilation device with an oxygen source (Zuo et al., 2020). A viral filter must be inserted between the facemask and manual ventilation device to minimize aerosolization. The viral filter should be applied directly to the face mask, since the greater the number of connections between the facemask and filter, the greater the risk of disconnection on the patient side and subsequent aerosolization of the virus (Zuo et al., 2020).",

The choice of videolaryngoscope should be made according to the skillset and clinical judgement of the airway operator (Brewster et al., 2020).

            "text": "The cornerstone of management in respiratory failure is mechanical ventilation, always with the aim of minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) (Fan et al., 2018). Early in the outbreak, all patients with severe COVID-19 were considered to have ARDS and consequently ventilated with low tidal volumes\u20146 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW)\u2014and plateau pressure, as well as high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (Fan et al., 2017). The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines on the Management of Critically Ill Adults with Coronavirus Disease, 2020 (Alhazzani et al., 2020) recommend using low-tidal volume (VT) ventilation (VT 4-8 mL/kg of PBW) instead of higher tidal volumes (VT >8 mL/kg PBW). Additionally, a higher PEEP (>10 cm H2O) strategy should be preferred over a lower PEEP, and PEEP should be titrated according to FiO2 to maintain an appropriate SpO2 in order to reduce atelectasis and alveolar hyperinflation as well as pulmonary vascular resistance [23]. Even though COVID-19 patients fulfill the Berlin criteria for ARDS (The ARDS Definition Task Force et al., 2012), the clinical and chest CT features of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients do not always resemble ARDS. In fact, these patients may present with relatively well-maintained lung mechanics (good compliance) but severe hypoxemia, which could be consequent to impaired lung perfusion. Moreover, chest CT patterns differ among patients and over time. As noted above, we have found that chest CT findings in COVID-19 fall into three different phenotypes, each warranting unique mechanical ventilation settings and management strategies, which should thus be individualized based on clinical and CT features (Fig. 1\n, Additional File 1, Fig. S1).",

It can also be influenced by longer duty cycles and higher driving pressures (Vieillard-Baron et al., 2016). High mean arterial pressure can increase West zone 2 conditions, thus increasing dead space and shunt fraction. In some cases, elevated right-side pressures may overdistend the right ventricle, thus causing stiffness of the left ventricle in an interdependent manner. Such condition needs to be evaluated by changes in venous saturation of oxygen (SvO2), and arterial saturation (SaO2) (Vieillard-Baron et al., 2016).",

Empiric antibiotics targeting any suspected potential bacterial superinfection should be administered as soon as possible. Systemic corticosteroids are controversial in severe ARDS; methylprednisolone can be used as appropriate for patients with rapid disease progression or severe illness. According to severity, 40 to 80 mg of methylprednisolone per day can be considered, and the total daily dose should not exceed 2 mg/kg. In a recent study (Wu et al., 2020), methylprednisolone therapy decreased the risk of death in COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure. However, due to lack of evidence, the routine use of corticosteroids should be avoided. Short courses (3\u20135 days) can be considered according to clinical status and chest imaging [23]. Corticosteroids might be especially useful in patients with a heightened inflammatory response; therefore, PCR and interleukin (IL)-6 levels should be considered when deciding whether to start steroids in these patients.",

As specific criteria for extubation of COVID-19 patients have not yet been established, generic guidelines (Popat et al., 2012) should be followed. Fig. 5\npresents our algorithm for weaning and extubation. Patients can be eligible for a trial of extubation once they are well awake, exhibit good cough reflexes, and have stable hemodynamic and ventilatory parameters. At this stage, a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is performed before considering endotracheal tube removal. NIV and HFNO can be considered after extubation (Jin et al., 2020). Patients should ideally be non-infective prior to extubation, but this is likely to be unfeasible. When patients are still at risk of transmission, few recommendations are available to reduce the risk of infection; these include placement of a simple oxygen mask on the patient immediately after extubation to minimize aerosolization, the use of high PEEP levels, and avoidance of cough. If feasible, separate beds should be reserved for patients suitable for extubation trials (regardless of whether they are still positive for SARS-CoV-2) to reduce the risk of reagudization and, ultimately, reinfection of other patients.",

PEEP should be set with the aim to redistribute pulmonary flow and reduce shunting. In this case, using the principles generally applied in ARDS, and thus setting the PEEP according to the best driving pressure, will probably lead to use of lower PEEP (as the compliance is good), resulting in less oxygenation. iNO could be considered in these cases, and prone positioning can redistribute perfusion, but is generally not very useful at this stage. Phenotype 2: atelectasis and derecruitment are predominant. In this case, high PEEP and prone positioning can recruit non-aerated areas of the lung. Recruitment maneuvers (RMs) may play a role in these cases, whereas iNO is less useful. Phenotype 3: typical CT pattern of moderate-to-severe ARDS, with alveolar edema and low compliance. Respiratory settings should follow the general principles applied for ARDS.
