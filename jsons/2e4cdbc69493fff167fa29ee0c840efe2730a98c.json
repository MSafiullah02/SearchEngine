            "text": "Objective: Causative viruses of postviral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD) have not yet been identified. The aim of this study was to investigate causative viruses in patients with PVOD. Study Design and Methods: Nasal discharge was collected from 24 patients with PVOD. We investigated the presence of 10 viruses in nasal discharge and examined the time course, with regard to changes in olfactory dysfunction and nasal obstruction in patients with PVOD, using questionnaires, acoustic rhinometry, and olfactory tests. Results: Rhinoviruses were detected in 10 patients by electrophoresis. Rhinoviruses were also confirmed in four patients by nucleotide sequences. Viral serotypes were identified to be human rhinovirus (HRV)-40, HRV-75, HRV-78, and HRV-80. One of the four patients complained of anosmia, whereas another complained of dysosmia. Olfactory testing did not show significant improvement at 4, 8, 11, and 24 weeks after the first visit in the four patients, although results of acoustic rhinometry significantly improved. Two of the four patients complained of olfactory dysfunction even 6 months after the first visit. Coronavirus and parainfluenza virus were detected in one patient each, and Epstein-Barr viruses were detected in three patients. Conclusions: This study for the first time detected rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and Epstein-Barr virus in nasal discharge of patients with PVOD. Furthermore, the present study suggests that rhinoviruses can cause olfactory dysfunction through mechanisms other than nasal obstruction and that rhinoviruses can induce various severities and different time courses of olfactory dysfunction.",

Bootstrap values greater than 70% were considered to be statistically significant for the grouping. 3 Detection of PIVs and RSVs was performed according to a previously described method. 4 The primers used for amplification of PIV type 1, 2, and 3 were PIV1PR3, PIV1PR5, PIV2PR3, PIV2PR5, PIV3PR3, and PIV3PR5. The primers used for amplification of PIV type 4 were 5\u0408-TTGTGTGTCTGATCCCATAAGCAGC-3\u0408 and 5\u0408-GGCTGAAC-GGTTGCATTCAGGT-3\u0408. Detection of CoVs was performed using the primers 2Bp and 4Bm in accordance with a previously reported method. 5 Detection of Epstein-Barr viruses (EBVs) was performed using a set of primers (5\u0408-CCGGTACCACCAGCAGCACCAG-CACA-3\u0408 and 5\u0408-GGCCGCGGTGGCCACCATGGTGGCCC-3\u0408) complementary to sequences located in the EBNA-2 region of the EBV gene. Separated PCR products by electrophoresis were also transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane and hybridized with a DIG-labeled probe (5\u0408-TTACATCATCTACCCCTG-3\u0408 for type A or 5\u0408-GCACTTCCTCCAACTCCA-3\u0408 for type B) according to the DIG system's user guide (Roche, Mannheim, CA). DNA hybrid was detected by enzyme-linked immunoassay using CSPD (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Detection of influenza A viruses and influenza B viruses was performed by a previously described method. 6 Detection of AdVs was performed by the method previously described by Saitoh-Inagawa et al. 7 PCR of varicellazoster viruses (VZVs) was performed according to a previously described method. 8 PCR of herpes simples viruses (HSVs) was also performed. The primers used for one-step amplification were 5\u0408-ACGTAACGCACGCTCGGGTG-3\u0408 for both of type 1 and 2, 5\u0408-GTCTCCTCCACCACCCAACCCCA-3\u0408 for type 1 and 5\u0408-CCCACGACTCCGGGGCCCCA-3\u0408 for type 2.

Questionnaires concerning nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, and olfactory function were used to assess the time course of nasal symptom change in 11 patients (Table II) . No patient complained of nasal discharge and nasal obstruction at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 11 weeks, and 24 weeks after the first visit, although all patients complained of nasal obstruction and nasal discharge during the first visit. Patients 4, 5, 7, and 11 complained of dysosmia. Patients 9 and 11, who had fever, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly, were diagnosed as infectious mononucleosis (IM). However, patient 10 did not have IM-like symptoms. Patient 10 had deteriorated olfactory dysfunction secondary to URI again at 24 weeks after the first visit, although olfactory dysfunction had improved 11 weeks after the first visit. All patients started to receive steroids at 8 weeks after the first visit. Eight patients had improvements at 11 weeks after the first visit. Six of 11 patients did not complain olfactory dysfunction 24 weeks after the first visiting.",

The difference, however, was not significant. Although Sug-iura et al. suggested that PIV type 3 is responsible for PVOD, PIV type 3 was not found in our present study. The reason for this discrepancy may be twofold. First, the titers for PIV type 3 in patients not only with PVOD but also with posttraumatic or rhinosinusitis increased in the report of Sugiura et al., and they did not find significant differences. 12 Second, it could be that the number of samples in this study is low. In addition, PVOD can be caused by canine PIV infection in dogs. 13 Although canine PIV shares structural features with human PIV type 3, it is most closely related to human PIV type 2. 14 Considering this, PIV type 2 could potentially be responsible for PVOD.",

In this case, however, the number of samples would have decreased. No virus was found during the second visit, suggesting that the viruses found in this study are not resident or present before URI. This may also hint at a relatively low sensitivity of this test. This study did show, however, that RVs, CoVs, PIVs, and EBVs were all present in nasal discharge of patients with PVOD and decreased with the improvement of the common cold despite the possibility that the test has a relatively low sensitivity. Also, evidence of a specific virus in the nasal cavity is not equal to the persistence of the virus within the olfactory cells. It has been shown that epithelium can be safely biopsied. 15 Therefore, future studies will be aimed at investigating viruses in biopsies of the olfactory region from patients with PVOD.
