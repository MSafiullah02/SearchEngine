            "text": "Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoVviruses enter the cell via endocytosis ( Figure ) into the endosomal pathway (Hong, ) . Once in the endosomal compartments, they escape into the cytoplasm and release the positivestranded RNA genome to trigger viral replication and assembly. Newly made viral proteins such as Spike protein and other membrane proteins enter the secretory pathway via targeting and assembling in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). During the transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus via a collection of tubulovesicular structures referred to as the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), other viral proteins such as nucleocapsid and newly made viral RNA genome assemble onto the membrane of the ERGIC to trigger inward budding of previral particles into the lumen of the ERGIC. These previral particles mature during the transport to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) of the Golgi apparatus, from where newly assembled viral particles are released by the infected cells via transport carriers budding from the TGN and fusing with the cell surface. The endosomal compartments are dynamically linked with the TGN via various transport routes between the endosomes and the TGN. Over the years, cell biologists and virologists have identified several inhibitors to the endocytic pathway and they are traditionally used to perturb the function of the endocytic pathway, which indirectly also affects the secretory pathway (Engel et al., ). These inhibitors include Ammonium chloride (NH Cl), Chloroquine, Bafilomycin A , Concanamycin A , and Monensin. Therefore, it is a reasonable hypothesis that inhibiting the function of the endocytic and secretory pathways will directly or indirectly suppress viral infection, replication, assembly, and/or release if the side effects are managed well.",

In this timely clinical study report (Huang et al., ), the authors have tested the clinical effects of Chloroquine on patients by monitoring viral RNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), lung function by computerized tomography (CT) scanning, and T-cell counts. Among patients examined, were identified to meet their enrollment criteria. These patients were divided into two groups, one (n = ) treated with Chloroquine ( mg, oral administration, twice daily) and the other (n = ) with Lopinavir/Ritonavir ( / mg, oral administration, twice daily) for days, and monitored for a total of days. Importantly, the Chloroquine-treated group displayed steady increases in the number of patients becoming negative for the viral RNA. By Day , all the Chloroquine-treated patients became negative in viral RNA test. In the Lopinavir/Ritonavir-treated group, out of turned negative at Day . CT scan imaging was used to see the lung clearance and the study revealed that lung improvement from the Chloroquine group was more than doubled compared with that of the Lopinavar/Ritonavir group, indicating that patients in the Chloroquine-treated group recover their pulmonary function more significantly than those in the group treated with Lopinavir/Ritonavir. More The endocytic pathway consists of various early and late recycling endosomes and late endosome (also called multivesicular bodies, MVB) before maturing into the lysosome. Newly made proteins enter the secretory pathway via ER and are transported to the TGN via the ERGIC and then the Golgi stack before being transported to the cell surface via transport carriers that bud from the TGN and fuse with the plasma membrane. Some of the internalized viruses are released from the endosome into the cytoplasm (step ) for unpacking and viral replication and assembly (step ). Newly made viral S protein and other membrane proteins enter the ER (step ) whereas viral RNA genome and nucleocapsid protein are assembled on the membrane of the ERGIC to trigger inward budding to form the previral particles into the lumen of the ERGIC (step ). Matured viruses are released via transport from the TGN to the cell surface (step ). Chloroquine directly inhibits endosomal function and likely indirectly affects the secretory pathway via perturbing the interface between the endosome and TGN, resulting in inhibition of viral endosomal release, replication, assembly, and/or release to achieve clinical benefit. significantly, patients in the Chloroquinetreated group were discharged from the hospital faster than those in the Lopinavir/Ritonavir-treated group, as all patients from the Chloroquine group were discharged as compared to patients ( %) from the Lopinavir/Ritonavir group by Day",

Although the molecular mechanism underlying the action of Chloroquine remains to be defined, it is envisioned that in addition to directly affecting the endosomal viral entry and release via inhibiting endosomal function, Chloroquine may potentially affect the viral assembly at the ERGIC and/or viral release from the TGN indirectly.",
