The model was calibrated using data on the confirmed cases and death from several countries like France, Philippines, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, China, and the USA. First, we derived the basic reproduction number, R 0 and estimated the effective reproduction R eff for each countries. Second, we were interested in the merits of containment. Results revealed that total and partial containment is effective in reducing the transmission. However, its duration may be long to eradicate the disease (185 days for France). By setting the end of containment as the day when hospital capacity is reached, numerical simulations showed that the duration can be reduced (up to only 84 days for France if the capacity is 1000 patients). Further, results pointed out that the effective reproduction number remains large after containment. Therefore, testing and isolation are necessary to stop the disease.",

            "text": "In this paper, we will mention a few models and at the end to propose one. Gardner and his team Gardner (2020) at Center for Systems Science and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University implemented on a previously published model applied for COVID-19. It is a metapopulation network model represented by a graph with each nodes follows a discrete-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental model. The model gives an estimate the expected number of cases in mainland China at the end of January 2020, as well as the global distribution of the infected travelers. They believe that the outbreak began in November 2019 with hundreds of infecteds already present in Wuhan last early December 2019. Wu et al.Wu et al. (2020) from WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control at University of Hong Kong presented a modelling study on the nowcast and forecast of the 2019-nCoV outbreak at Wuhan. The group used an SEIR metapopulation model to simulate epidemic and found reproductive number R 0 around 2.68 (with 95% credible interval 2.47-2.86). Imai et al. Imai et al. (2020) estimates R 0 around 2.6 with uncertainty range of 1.5-3.5. Zhao et al.Zhao et al. (2020a,b) found R 0 to range from 2.24 to 5.71 based on the reporting rate of cases. If the reporting rate increase 2-fold, R 0 = 3.58, if it increase 8-fold, R 0 = 2.24. If there is no change in the reporting rate, the estimated R 0 is 5.71. Similar with the above authors, Wang et al. employed an infectious disease dynamics model (SEIR model) for the purpose of modeling and predicting the number of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan. They opined that in order to significantly reduce R 0 the government should continue implementing strict measures on containment and public health issues. In the same tune as the latter, the model of Danchin et al. Danchin et al. (2020) also suggests to continue implementing effective quarantine measures as to avoid resurgence of infection. The model consist of five (5) compartments: susceptible, infected, alternative infection, detected and removed.",

Reciprocally, local asymptotic stability of DFE does not necessarily imply R 0 < 1. Here we will prove that global asymptotic stability is independent that of R 0 . Indeed, from the last differential equation in our system of ODE, we can deduce that R is an increasing function bounded by N (0). Thus R(t) converges to R * as t goes to +\u221e.

Comparison between three strategies can be found in Table  1 and Figures 4-5. Without intervention to control the disease, the maximum number of symptomatic infecteds varies from 3.49 \u00d7 10 5 to 2.02 \u00d7 10 7 . The maximum number of deaths totals from 8.85 \u00d7 10 3 to 7.92 \u00d7 10 6 . Concerning France, Philippines, Italy, Spain and Unitedd Kingddom, when containment is fully respected and when the sum of infecteds is reduced to 1, the maximum number of symptomatic infecteds and deaths has been cut sharply, of an order 10 3 . It varies now from 5.75 \u00d7 10 2 to 7.04 \u00d7 10 4 and 1.94 \u00d7 10 2 to 2.52 \u00d7 10 4 respectively. To wait from 131 to 315 days is the price to paid. On the contrary, for the states of Hubei and New York, 53 days to intervene seems to be already too late.

The simplest choice consists in reducing contact between individuals. Table 1 and Figures 4-5 show that total and partial containment do indeed drastically reduce the disease. However the duration of containment may be too long, and then impracticable especially if we aim at totally eradicating the infection (T c = 1). Instead, to stop the containment as soon as the capacity of the hospitals has been reached could be privileged. When this criterion is set to 1000 patients (T c = 1000), the duration goes from 157 to 92 days for France. Similar reduction in duration is also obtained for other countries. Again, we see that the earlier the intervention, the more effective it is. Due to the high number of susceptible, it is worth noting that the effective reproduction number remains large after containment. Screening tests are then necessary to be carried out and the positive individuals be quarantined.",
