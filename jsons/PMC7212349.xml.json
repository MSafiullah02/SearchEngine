            "text": "More than a 100 RNA modifications have been identified since the 1950s (Boccaletto et al., 2018). They were first observed in abundant populations of non-coding transcripts (e.g., tRNAs) and in a second moment, due to the improvement of profiling techniques, their pervasive presence was confirmed in coding transcripts (Roundtree et al., 2017). Different modifications were found to co-occur on the same RNA molecule (Jackman and Alfonzo, 2013). In some cases, rather than a mere stochastic effect due to the modification frequency, their co-occurrence suggested reciprocal regulation mechanisms (Xiang et al., 2018).",

            "text": "The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) emerged as one of the most abundant modifications of coding transcripts (Roundtree et al., 2017), and it was shown to be involved in the regulation of various biological processes, including cellular differentiation (Lin and Gregory, 2014; Wang Y. et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015; Geula et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2017a), meiosis (Bushkin et al., 2019), heat stress response (Zhou et al., 2015), gametogenesis (Wojtas et al., 2017), and neurons activity (Engel et al., 2018). Furthermore, aberrant m6A patterning was shown to be associated with diseases insurgence and progression (Tong et al., 2018; Ianniello et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019). A number of effectors were identified that are responsible for m6A deposition (e.g., METTL3 and METTL14) (Liu et al., 2014; Ping et al., 2014; Schwartz et al., 2014), recognition (e.g., members of the YTH domain family) (Luo and Tong, 2014; Xu et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2016), and removal (FTO and ALKBH5) (Jia et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2013), suggesting that this mark could be dynamically regulated. Genome-wide m6A profiling, through immunoprecipitation with m6A-specific antibodies followed by short-reads RNA sequencing (srRNA-seq), revealed the preferential, while not exclusive, association of the mark with the central adenosine in the RRACH sequence context around the stop codon of messenger RNAs (R = G or A and H = A, C, or U) (Dominissini et al., 2012; Meyer et al., 2012). Notably, m6A marks have been linked to different biological processes depending on their relative position within a transcript, suggesting a context-specific role for this mark (Shi et al., 2019). However, we have only started revealing the rules that determine the preference of the mark for specific bases, and their impact on specific downstream biological processes (Yue et al., 2018). Altogether, m6A was identified as a key determinant of RNA decay (Wang X. et al., 2014) and translation (Wang et al., 2015), while discordant reports were published about its involvement in splicing regulation (Haussmann et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2016; Bartosovic et al., 2017; Ke et al., 2017; Darnell et al., 2018; Kasowitz et al., 2018; Louloupi et al., 2018).",

Then, total RNA-seq reads are used to measure the abundance of premature and mature transcripts: reads that entirely map to one or more exons are used to quantify mature RNA species, and the remaining mapped reads (entirely, or partially, covering introns) are used for the quantification of premature species. Finally, the combination of synthesis rate and premature RNA abundance is used to quantify the rate of processing, while the combination of synthesis rate and mature RNA abundance allows the quantification of degradation rates (Furlan et al., 2019a).",

            "text": "Numerous protocols based on srRNA-seq were developed for the identification of either endogenous (e.g., m6A) or exogenous (e.g., 4sU) RNA modifications. A first class of methods is based on the enrichment of modified RNAs before the sequencing. This relies either on the use of specific antibodies [e.g., MeRIP-seq for m6A detection (Dominissini et al., 2012; Meyer et al., 2012)], or the use of enzymes involved in the metabolism of the modification [e.g., tRNA methyltransferase DnmA (Muller et al., 2013)], or on the availability of tags such as biotin on the modified residues [e.g., 4sU-based RNA metabolic labeling (Dolken et al., 2008)]. These techniques do not provide neither the exact modification site (they are limited to 100\u2013200 bp resolution), nor a precise quantification of the proportion of modified transcripts (Molinie et al., 2016), despite the development of ad hoc experimental (Sun et al., 2012) and computational (de Pretis et al., 2015) normalization techniques. Indeed, an alternative approach, m6A-LAIC-seq (Molinie et al., 2016) has been developed that relies on spike-ins to provide a precise quantification of the m6A abundance, at the cost of skipping the RNA fragmentation step and losing positional information on the mark. A second class of methodologies is based on the identification of RNA modifications signatures in the retro-transcribed cDNA. One approach belonging to this class exploits the early interruption of retrotranscription at the modification site to produce specific truncation signatures [e.g., ICE-seq for inosine detection (Sakurai et al., 2010)]. Alternative approaches were developed to retro-transcribe the modified bases and their native counterparts to different nucleotides, thus inferring the site of the modification based on specific mismatches in the reads alignment (Baptista and D\u00f6lken, 2018). For example, SLAM-seq allows the in silico identification of reads derived from nascent RNAs by inducing the pairing of alkylated 4sU to guanines (Herzog et al., 2017). These methods markedly increase the resolution, but are typically semi-quantitative, suffering from low sensitivity (Neumann et al., 2019). Hybrid techniques were also developed. For example, methylation induced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (miCLIP) combines m6A-immunoprecipitation with the antibody cross-linking, leading to conversion and truncation events. Their identification in the sequencing results allows the mapping of m6A at base-resolution (Linder et al., 2015). However, this method is affected by low crosslink efficiency, reducing the sensitivity. Recently, two novel approaches were developed that do not rely on immunoprecipitation. MAZTER-seq (Garcia-Campos et al., 2019) allows the quantitative and base-resolution identification of m6A marks, relying on the use of a restriction enzyme that cuts only when the target site is not methylated. As a downside, the mapping is limited to the identification of m6A marks in specific context sites (16% of all expected m6A sites in mammals). DART-seq (Meyer, 2019) recruits APOBEC1 proteins at m6A sites through readers of the YTH family, allowing the identification of the marks by the detection of adjacent C to U mutations. It was used in combination with srRNA-seq, with as little as 10 ng of total RNA, and with long-reads RNA sequencing (lrRNA-seq), leading to single transcript m6A detection. The key downside of this method is the required cells transfection with APOBEC1-YTH fusion protein. Finally, the ability to quantify the abundance of m6A marks remains to be established.",

Indeed, a detailed protocol was described for its application on MeRIP-seq datasets (Meng et al., 2014). This tool adopts a sliding window approach with a conditional test relying on Poisson distributions. HEPeak is an HMM-based tool dedicated to the identification of m6A marks, claiming improved sensitivity and specificity compared to exomePeak (Cui et al., 2015). From the same authors, MeTPeak was later proposed that is able to take advantage of the variance across replicates, and models the reads dependency across a region (Cui et al., 2016). A number of tools were developed that are dedicated to differential RNA methylation analysis, including MeTDiff (Cui et al., 2018), FunDMDeep (Zhang S. Y. et al., 2019), and RADAR (Zhang Z. et al., 2019).

First, they require specific reagents for each modification of interest, which currently limits the profiling to a handful of modifications (Helm and Motorin, 2017). Second, the library preparations, and the sequencing procedure, remove the RNA marks. As a consequence, most available approaches for the modifications profiling are indirect, reducing specificity and sensitivity (Helm and Motorin, 2017). Third, the reduced length of srRNA-seq reads (50\u2013300 bp) is a major obstacle for the analysis of individual RNA molecules, despite the development of methods to infer isoforms expression from these data (Zhang et al., 2017b). As a consequence, the assignment of individual or co-occurring modifications to a given RNA molecule, or even to a given isoform, is not feasible. Fourth, srRNA-seq protocols are not readily applicable to detect two (or more) RNA modifications simultaneously.",

The reasons for this limitation are manifolds. Likely, the methods for the profiling of different modifications should be consecutively applied, and the output of one method could be poorly suitable for the subsequent. For the same reason, a high amount of starting material is likely to be necessary, to avoid capturing only highly expressed transcripts. Alternatively, numerous rounds of PCR would be necessary, introducing amplification biases (Aird et al., 2011; Kebschull and Zador, 2015). The limitations in specificity and sensitivity of each method would combine. Moreover, it would be crucial and cumbersome to develop normalization procedures for the comparison of the results from each approach, possibly based on spike-ins. Finally, it would be hard to keep track of the positional information of each modification.",

            "text": "Things would get even more complicated when, in addition to the mark of interest, the dynamics of RNA metabolism are also of interest, which require the identification of an exogenous modification as second mark. In this case, to quantify the RNA kinetic rates of modified and unmodified RNAs, it would be necessary to quantify all four possible combinations: nascent/modified, nascent/unmodified, pre-existing/modified, and pre-existing/unmodified transcripts (Figure 2). Currently, the best approach to jointly identify 4sU and m6A would be to start by separating nascent and pre-existing RNA using 4sU metabolic labeling and purification (Dolken et al., 2008). Then, for each of these, the m6A-LAIC-seq protocol could be applied to separate m6A methylated RNAs from unmethylated transcripts. At the end, four samples per condition should be prepared and sequenced. This approach is evidently very complex and onerous, it would require a lot of starting material and complicated downstream analyses, including spike-ins based normalization of the datasets. For all these reasons, the most common compromise is to profile m6A, and to perform metabolic labeling through independent experiments (Li et al., 2017; Furlan et al., 2019b). However, this type of approach completely compromises the possibility of a direct quantification of the dynamics of modified and unmodified transcripts, since it only allows to quantify the dynamics of the pool of transcripts for each gene, and then combine this information with the expected degree of modification for that population. Altogether, approaches based on srRNA-seq are increasingly inadequate and could hamper the progress in the field of epitranscriptomics.",

            "text": "In the last few years remarkable efforts were dedicated to overcoming the limitations of srRNA-seq based approaches (Stark et al., 2019) for the identification of RNA modifications within individual RNA molecules and isoforms. As a result, few novel sequencing approaches that emerged recently allow rRNA-seq. One platform, PacBio (developed by Pacific Biosciences), exploits a sequencing by synthesis approach mediated by an immobilized polymerase (Eid et al., 2009). Another one, which will be the main focus in the next sections of this perspective, was developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), and consists of an array of thousands of nanopores which allow a flow of ions across a dielectric membrane, thus generating a measurable current. The active translocation of a molecule of nucleic acids (either DNA, cDNA, or RNA) through each pore, mediated by an engineered motor protein, results in a sequence-specific perturbation of the measured current. In turn, this signal can be exploited to infer the corresponding sequence of nucleotides (Kasianowicz et al., 1996; Smith et al., 2015). lrRNA-seq approaches were successfully used to study transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in various physiological and disease conditions (De Roeck et al., 2017; Aneichyk et al., 2018; Anvar et al., 2018; Nattestad et al., 2018), including single-cells (Byrne et al., 2017). Focusing on RNAs, these techniques can produce single reads of up to 104 bases, with an average length of almost 1 Kb for ONT (Workman et al., 2018). Hence, in a number of cases, this allows the profiling of full-length RNA molecules, and the fine characterization of their alternative isoforms. This is especially true for mature transcripts, whose median length for human and mouse mRNAs is around 2 Kb [based on the hg19 and mm10 UCSC genome releases (Haeussler et al., 2019)]. Instead, the likelihood of sequencing full-length premature transcripts is lower. Indeed, their median open reading frame length is in the 13\u201318 Kb range, although co-transcriptional splicing could significantly reduce this figure (it is likely that some intron was already excised before the completion of RNA synthesis).",

            "text": "However, a number of limitations characterize the young field of dRNA-seq. First, current dRNA-seq protocols are available only for the sequencing of targeted, non-polyadenylated RNAs (Keller et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2019) or polyadenylated RNAs. This is due to the library preparation protocolos, which typically targets polyA tails or specific 3\u2032 sequences for ligating sequencing adapters anchoring the motor protein. This limitation could be addressed using adapters with random 3\u2032 sequences, with the risk of introducing a bias for recurrent RNA motifs, or through in vitro polyadenylation of transcripts devoid of a polyA-tail (Wongsurawat et al., 2018). Second, while the throughput of dRNA-seq is rapidly growing, it currently compares to the low- or mid-end coverage of srRNA-seq experiments. This could limit the number of detectable transcripts, although, importantly, the abundance of those that can be detected is well correlated with high-coverage srRNA-seq data (Garalde et al., 2018). This issue could be solved in the future by improving the speed of translocation of RNAs across the nanopore, and/or extending the sequencing time by prolonging the pores\u2019 lifetime. Noteworthy, given the same throughput in terms of sequenced bases, lrRNA-seq vs srRNA-seq data have a substantial difference: while the former allows detecting entire transcripts, the latter offers a more unbiased sampling of any RNA fragment, thus also covering a larger portion of the transcriptome (Soneson et al., 2019). This could in part be obviated by a coarse RNA fragmentation before the library preparation, and would also reduce the 3\u2032 coverage bias of dRNA-seq data, whose reads start from a transcript\u2019s 3\u2032 end. A drawback of this approach is that it would compromise the one-to-one correspondence between reads and RNA molecules. Third, the accuracy of base calling on dRNA-seq data is currently significantly lower than srRNA-seq. When base calling errors occur at sites of RNA modification, they are likely due to the inability of the base caller\u2019s to deal with changes in the signal originated by those marks. However, these errors represent a small fraction of incorrect base calls, due to the low number of marks per transcripts (e.g., 2\u20133 m6A marks per RNA). Hence, reduced base calling accuracy is not considered a major issue in the field of RNA modifications but, on the contrary, represents an opportunity for aiding the identification of modified bases (Liu et al., 2019). Fourth, there could be limitations on the detectability of specific RNA modifications. For example, in the context of RNA metabolic labeling, the ability of dRNA-seq to identify various (exogenous) modified nucleotides was tested (Maier et al., 2019). This revealed that 4sU modified nucleotides, commonly used in metabolic labeling through srRNA-seq, were not compatible with the nanopores, leading to blockages during the sequencing, although this issue was not confirmed in a more recent report (Drexler et al., 2019). Instead, other marks, such as 5-ethynyluridine (5eU), were found to be suitable for these experiments.",

Eventually, those transcripts were shown to be targeted to specific cellular compartments, including stress-granules and P-bodies, with important consequences for their translation and stability (Ries et al., 2019).",

In fact, various confounding factors could potentially affect direct RNA sequencing data, which could be easier to address in a supervised framework. However, supervised methods require training on sets of modified transcripts, which should be built so that they closely reflect the characteristics of in vivo datasets. For example, for endogenous modifications, rather than producing in vitro fully modified transcripts, the level of modification could be tuned by mixing unmodified and modified nucleotides to match the expected frequency of the mark. For exogenous marks, the approach described in Maier et al. (2019) could be followed, where physiological high-level of incorporation of a modified nucleotides are obtained by its prolonged availability in the cells medium.",

However, RNA synthesis and processing are tightly coupled, then when the former is modulated, which often occurs, the latter is also expected to be altered (Neugebauer, 2019). Moreover, recent reports start unveiling the frequency and importance of changes in splicing dynamics (Rabani et al., 2014; de Pretis et al., 2015, 2017; Louloupi et al., 2018; Furlan et al., 2019a; Wachutka et al., 2019). The cost of considering the processing step is two fold: it markedly increases the complexity of the underlying mathematical models, and implies the quantification of the abundance of premature RNA species. The latter is specifically problematic for the ONT platform. Indeed, the library preparation procedure expects transcripts with the polyA tail, which are lacking in premature RNAs. In vitro polyadenylation with m6A could be used for adding m6A-tails to premature transcripts. This would allow the sequencing of premature RNAs, and would preserve the sequencing information about the endogenous tails of mature transcripts, for studies on their functional impact on RNA dynamics.",

The presence of an endogenous polyA tail would provide a way to computationally identifying reads from mature species. However, this approach would fail for those mRNAs that are not polyadenylated in their endogenous mature form. An alternative criterion is to consider the reads containing introns as premature RNA. This could be problematic in case of intron retention, which in many organisms, including humans, is not infrequent (Chaudhary et al., 2019; Monteuuis et al., 2019). The request of more than one intron in order to classify a read as premature RNA would probably eliminate this issue. Of course, such a strict condition would cause the exclusion of those genes that have less than two introns, which often occurs in some organisms (e.g., yeast or plants). The best criterion could eventually be a mix of the proposed approaches, selected according to the biological system under analysis and the transcripts of interest. For instance, to study mRNA kinetics in mammalian cells, mature RNA could be estimated considering fully spliced, polyadenylated transcripts, while premature RNA could be quantified from the remaining reads, possibly requiring the presence of one or more introns.",

The performance of such an approach should be tested on a dataset generated ad hoc. The genesis of reads with both the RNA modifications, or missing only the exogenous mark, is feasible by using or avoiding long-time metabolic labeling, respectively. Instead, reads devoid of both the base analogs can be produced sequencing the corresponding cDNA. It is more difficult to generate transcripts that lack only the endogenous modification, which could be obtained by knocking-out the corresponding writer (for those marks for which this is known).
