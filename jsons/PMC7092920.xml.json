Virions pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S protein or with the envelope glycoprotein G of VSV (VSV-G) were used to infect untreated (control) or M\u03b2CD-treated Vero E6 cells. Negligible background level of luciferase activity could be detected in lysates prepared from the cells infected with pNL4-3Luc+Env\u2212Vpr\u2212 virions (Fig. 4\n, NL4-3). Productive infection of SARS-CoV pseudovirus was inhibited about 90% after depletion of cholesterol (Fig. 4, S), but the infectivity of VSV pseudovirus did not change significantly (Fig. 4, VSV-G). These results demonstrate that disruption of lipid rafts dramatically inhibits productive infection of viruses pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S protein but not VSV-G, which enter the cell through a rafts-independent pathway [13].",

Thus, the differential expression of its receptor, ACE2 [15] could contribute to the entry process of SARS-CoV. ACE2 is abundantly expressed on the surface of lung and intestinal epithelial cells, consistent with their susceptibility to SARS-CoV [16]. Additionally, epithelial cells are highly polarized cells, and ACE2 is expressed predominately on the apical surface of these cells [17] where lipid rafts are concentrated. Although it has been shown that lipid rafts are important for the entry of coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E [9] and MHV [10], its role in SARS-CoV entry is undetermined.",

[18], [19] have provided strong evidence to show that SARS-CoV enters cell by an endosomal pathway, and the cleavage of S protein to S1 and S2 by cathepsin L is necessary for fusion. Matsuyama et al. [20] found that various proteases, such as trypsin are effective in inducing fusion of SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. So SARS-CoV has the potential to enter host cells via two different pathways, either an endosomal or a non-endosomal pathway, depending on the presence of proteases. In either of these pathways, only S protein bound to its receptor and cleaved by proteases could obtain fusion activity. The distribution of its receptors plays important roles in its entry.",

We demonstrated that ACE2 was largely colocalized with raft marker caveolin-1 and GM1. Our results are different from the results of Turner\u2019s group [17]. They found that ACE2 is not raft-localized in CHO Cells. By now whether the raft localization of ACE2 is cell type specific has not been confirmed yet. Our results show that ACE2 was shifted to the nonraft environment after depletion of cholesterol. Using single-cycle infectivity assay, we also found that depletion of cholesterol from cell membranes resulted in 90% reduction of the luciferase activity in cells infected with SARS-CoV pseudovirus but not VSV pseudovirus. Furthermore, the cell surface expression of ACE2 and the binding of S protein ectodomain to Vero E6 cells did not change significantly after cholesterol depletion. The results eliminate the possibility that M\u03b2CD inhibits viral entry by down regulating the receptor, and subsequently deceasing the virus binding. All the evidence suggests that raft integrity is crucial for productive entry of SARS-CoV pseudovirus into Vero E6 cells and specific concentration of ACE2 in lipid rafts may explain why SARS-CoV selects these microdomains for entry. The preferential association of an ectodomain of S protein with lipid rafts further supports our hypothesis that SARS-CoV receptor localizes in these microdomains and represents the population of membrane receptor engaged in virus binding and entry.",

            "text": "How does lipid rafts affect the efficiency of SARS-CoV entry and productive infection? Coronaviruses enter the host cells either by direct membrane fusion with the plasma membrane or by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Membrane fusion is a cooperative process, and lipid rafts concentrate components of the membrane docking and fusion machinery for endocytosis [21], such as actin polymerization [22] which is important for the membrane fusion and endocytosis. An increased concentration of these proteins in rafts facilitates their intermolecular interactions by proximity. Nicolau et al. [23] used a stochastic spatial model of the plasma membrane to investigate the role of lipid rafts in signal transduction. Their results showed that partitioning of protein into rafts increases specific interprotein collision rates. Thus, rafts serve as membrane \u201creaction vessels\u201d, increasing the chance for two specific proteins of low concentration to meet on the membrane and in turn, increasing the collision rate to increase the efficiency of membrane reactions. In the case of SARS-CoV, lipid rafts could provide a convenient platform to concentrate receptor ACE2 as clusters on host cell membrane to dock efficiently with the spike protein on viral envelope. The finding that CD209 L (L-SIGN), a C-type lection-associated with lipid rafts serving as an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV [24], lends further support to our view. Induced by virus binding, lipid rafts are aggregated as a reaction platform by the stimulation of signaling pathways emanating from these microdomains to facilitate the sequential incorporation and fusion process.",
