In 1990, feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE) was identified as a cause of nervous disease in cats (Wyatt et al., 1990, Wyatt et al., 1991, Wyatt, 1991). It was subsequently shown that FSE had the characteristics of a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) (Pearson et al., 1992) and that in mouse transmission studies its behaviour was similar to that of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (Fraser et al., 1994). At that time the archive of post-mortem diagnoses of feline neurological cases was briefly reviewed (Pearson et al., 1993), but detailed histopathological examination was not undertaken. More recently, serological and molecular evidence of exposure of cats in the UK to Borna disease virus (BDV) has been reported (Reeves et al., 1998). The aims of this study were (1) to extend the preliminary retrospective survey of the Bristol University archive of cats with neurological disease, (2) to review the histology of cases of nervous disorders, (3) to categorize the nature of the pathological changes, and (4) to search for histological evidence that FSE may have occurred in the UK before it was first recognized in 1990.",

In all, 301 cases of feline neurological disease in cats were identified, consisting of 234 cases referred from the University of Bristol Veterinary School, and 67 submitted mainly as formalin-fixed tissues from outside practitioners. However, in 11 cases no central nervous system (CNS) material had been collected, and in a further four the original tissues, blocks or slides were unavailable. As a result, the cases from which histological sections were available for review numbered 286. The material examined, which varied between cases, is summarized in Table 1\n. In 1990 the sampling procedure was standardized to include brain sections from the anterior cerebrum, mid-cerebrum (thalamic level), posterior cerebrum (including the midbrain), cerebellum and medulla at the level of the obex. The breeds represented in the 286 cases were: Domestic shorthair (172), Siamese (27), Domestic longhair (22), Burmese (19), Birman (13), Persian (8), Rex (4), miscellaneous (19) and unknown (2).",

The most common diagnoses in this group were cerebellar hypoplasia (four cats) and lysosomal storage diseases (three cats) (Fig. 1). Storage disorders were identified by the presence of many swollen abnormal neuronal cell bodies (Summers et al., 1995). In one kitten, electron microscopy and histochemical stains supported the initial diagnosis, and biochemical analysis of tissue (Dr Bryan Winchester, personal communication) confirmed the storage disorder to be a GM1 gangliosidosis (Barker et al., 1986). In another case the diagnosis was confirmed by thin layer chromatography but no detailed information was available. A dermoid cyst present at the level of the third thoracic vertebra of a 16-month-old cat resulted in ataxia and euthanasia (Henderson et al., 1993). The remaining diagnoses included one case each of hypomyelinogenesis, neuraxonal dystrophy, syringomyelia and cerebellar abiotrophy.",

            "text": "FSE was diagnosed in 24 cats, with an average age of 6 years. FSE lesions were absent in the brains of 136 cats which died before recognition of the first case of FSE by Wyatt et al. (1990); after this first case, however, 23 of 149 cats examined post mortem were found to have FSE. The diagnosis was confirmed by demonstrating typical lesions in the brain and spinal cord, consisting of: widespread neuropil vacuolation, particularly of the grey matter; neuronal vacuolation, with one or multiple empty vacuoles, throughout the CNS but particularly in the thalamus, midbrain, obex and spinal cord; astrocytic hyperplasia and hypertrophy (Wyatt et al., 1991). In five cats, there was also evidence of mild perivascular cuffing (Fig. 7) in the cerebrum or medulla, or both, and in one of these five animals focal accumulation of lymphoid cells in the meninges of the brain and spinal cord. One of these five cats also had a large protozoal cyst within the hippocampus, without any inflammatory reaction (see above). The dual presence in these five animals of FSE lesions and lesions indicative of possible viral infection suggests the presence of more than one disease process.",

In one cat with hydrocephalus and an inflammatory infiltrate typical of FIP (Krum et al., 1975), the original description did not include reference to the inflammatory infiltrate. A second cat was originally reported to have an inflammatory and degenerative lesion of the midbrain and medulla, but on review the lesion was considered to be associated with a pleomorphic tumour (possibly a glioma of the astrocytoma type). The cells were variable in appearance and it would seem were originally interpreted as purely inflammatory. Other cases in which the original and final diagnoses differed were more difficult to interpret. These cats included five in the group with degenerative changes; in these animals the lesion distribution or appearance suggested viral infections such as FIV (Poli et al., 1997), although gliosis did not appear to be a feature. In addition, there may have been overlap between the inflammatory lesions associated with FIP virus and with other viral agents. Other techniques (e.g., immunohistochemistry) might have helped to classify these cases further.",

The distribution was similar to that found in other studies (Gavin et al., 1995). Lymphoma, a common CNS neoplasm, tends to occur in the spinal canal more often than the cranium (Wheeler, 1989). Of the 18 lymphomas identified in this study: nine were confined to the spinal canal (seven being confined to the spinal canal or meninges, and two to the cord); four were confined to the brain; one was confined to the brain meninges; and four were present in both the brain and spinal canal. The present findings are therefore in accordance with those of Wheeler (1989). Neoplastic cells may be present subdurally, causing compression of the cord and secondary degeneration, or may infiltrate the parenchyma causing direct damage. Eight cats in this study had meningeal or extradural lymphomatous infiltrates with secondary cord compression. Lymphoma affecting the CNS is often part of a generalized disease (Wheeler, 1989).",
