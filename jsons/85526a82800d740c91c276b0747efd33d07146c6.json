In this work we assessed how the innate immune 32 response contributes to the pathogenesis of RNA virus infections.

These molecules are induced during viral infections, yet the relative 44 contributions of each interferon or cytokine to host defense and a return to homeostasis remains 45 undefined. In particular the actions of type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bb) have attracted much attention, as 46 these cytokines operate primarily at mucosal surfaces, in part due to the selective expression of 47 the type III IFN receptor in epithelia and neutrophils (1-3). Recent work established that unlike 48 their type I or II counterparts, type III IFN signaling induces antiviral activities while simultaneously 49 minimizing the tissue destructive activity of neutrophils (4-6). When considered in the context of 50 an increasing number of viral infections, including the recently emerged severe acute respiratory 51 syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV)-2, where inflammation appears to be the primary driver of 52 life threatening symptoms (7-12) , the ability of type III IFNs to limit immunopathology but maintain 53 antiviral activity is significant. Indeed, discussions on the possible use of IFN-\u03bb against SARS-54 COV-2 have begun (13) and a clinical trial (14) has been initiated with the human pegylated-IFN-55 \u03bb1a. Despite this interest of the use of type III IFNs to treat viral infections, we know very little 56 about the short-and long-term actions of this family of secreted factors. 57 During viral infections of the lung, immunopathology may predispose the host to opportunistic 58 bacterial infections, referred to as superinfections, which take advantage of this unbalanced status 59 and often lead to lethal consequences (15-17). In contrast to its protective effect against acute 60 viral infections, IFN-\u03bb was found to decrease bacterial control in virus-bacteria superinfection 61 models(18-20) . Whether this is due to the anti-inflammatory activity of IFN-\u03bb that results in a 62 reduced resistance of the host to a subsequent bacterial infection or to the capacity of this group 63 of interferons to alter the physiology of the lung upon a viral encounter remains unresolved. As 64 of present the contribution of type III IFN to the human pathology of severe viral infections and 65 bacterial superinfections is unknown. Superinfections represent the first cause of lethality upon 66 influenza virus infection (21) and correlate with severity in coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 67 4 patients (11, 22-24). Mouse models of SARS, middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) (25, 26) 68 and influenza (5, 27-29) are characterized by a robust induction of IFN-\u03bb, however, the 69 involvement of this group of interferons in COVID-19 is more controversial. Although in vitro 70 studies on nasal and bronchial primary epithelial cells demonstrate IFN-\u03bb induction by SARS-71 CoV-2 (30), another study found a reduced production of both type I and type III IFNs in vitro and 72 ex vivo (31). 73 To directly evaluate the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to induce interferons in the upper or 74 lower airways, we tested the presence of IFNs, and other inflammatory cytokines, in the swabs 75 of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, as well as the bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid of severe 76 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Although we confirmed that COVID-19 patients present a scarce 77 production of inflammatory mediators in the upper airways, the BAL fluid of patients with severe 78",

            "text": "Interestingly, the gene that was most downregulated in Ifnlr1 -/epithelial cells compared to 173 WT cells is the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase makorin-1 (Mrkn1) (Fig. 3A) , 174 which controls p53 and p21 stability by favoring their proteasomal degradation (48) . Under 175 oxidative stress condition and DNA damage, a hallmark of severe viral infections (49), p53 is 176 stabilized by phosphorylation and p21 degradation, mediated by Mkrn1, favors apoptosis over 177 DNA repair (48). Indeed, Ifnlr1 -/epithelial cells, that express lower levels of Mkrn1, have elevated 178 levels of p21 as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 3H , I). These data indicate that the capacity of 179 IFN-\u03bb to reduce tissue tolerance stems from its capacity to inhibit tissue repair by directly 180 influencing epithelial cell proliferation and viability. Also, that p21 degradation via Mrkn1 181 upregulation is potently influenced by IFN-\u03bb signaling. 182 RNA viruses can use several strategies to modulate the immune response to their 183 advantage(33, 50), therefore it is crucial to understand the molecular pathways involved in the 184 maintenance of sustained IFN-\u03bb production. Moreover, the difference between mRNA expression 185 and protein levels of interferons suggest that a low abundance cell type with high secretory 186 capacity may be responsible for long term IFN-\u03bb production. We thus investigated the cellular 187 source and molecular pathways that drive IFN-\u03bb production in our model. Early after initial 188 influenza virus infection, IFN-\u03bb is expressed by infected epithelial cells, however, at later time 189 points, DCs from the parenchyma of the lung start to express high levels of the IFN-\u03bb transcript(5). 190 We thus hypothesized that lung DCs are the main producers of IFN-\u03bb and are responsible for the 191 secretion of IFN-\u03bb during viral infections. Accordingly, sorted lung resident dendritic cells express 192 high levels of IFN-\u03bb transcript after 5 days of poly (I:C) treatment, in contrast to epithelial cells, 193 alveolar macrophages and monocytes (Fig. 4A) , which, instead, express inflammatory cytokines (Fig. S8A, B) . Moreover, diphtheria toxin (DT)-mediated depletion of 195 CD11c + cells in CD11c-DT receptor (DTR) mice was sufficient to completely abolish IFN-\u03bb 9 transcript and protein upregulation upon 6 days of poly (I:C) treatment (Fig. 4B, C) , while production remained unaltered (Fig. S8C with the response measured in vivo, TLR7 stimulation did not induce IFN production while it 207 induced upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and intracellular delivery of poly (I:C) induced 208 high levels of IFN-I but not IFN-\u03bb (Fig.4D, Fig. S9A , B). In agreement with the key role of TLR3, 209 IFN-\u03bb production upon extracellular poly (I:C) encounter was abolished by genetic deletion of the 210 signaling adaptor TRIF (encoded by the gene Ticam1) but not by deletion of the RIG-I/MDA5 211 adaptor MAVS (Mavs) (Fig. 4D) . Conversely, IFN-I production in response to intracellular delivery 212 of poly (I:C) was largely dependent on the signaling adaptor MAVS (Fig. S9A ). Consistent with 213 our previous data, when the RIG-I/MAVS pathway was activated by transfection of the influenza 214 A virus derived pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) 3-phosphate-hairpin-RNA (3p-215 hpRNA), IFN-I but not IFN-\u03bb, was efficiently induced in a MAVS-dependent manner ( Fig. S10A -216 E, poly (I:C) was used as a control). Finally, inhibition of endosomal acidification by treatment with 217 the pharmacological agent chloroquine abolished IFN-\u03bb induction in response to extracellular poly 218 (I:C), while it preserved IFN-I production upon intracellular poly (I:C) delivery (Fig. S11A, B) . 219",

In a system that allowed us to isolate the effect of immune activation 243 from resistance to viral infection, we demonstrate that sustained IFN-\u03bb production in the lung in 244 response to viral PAMPs compromises epithelial barrier function, induces lung pathology and 245 morbidity and predisposes to lethal secondary infections by impairing the capacity of the lungs to 246 tolerate bacterial invasion. Loss of lung barrier tolerance is sufficient to induce lethality upon 247 bacterial challenge independently of bacterial growth (39), and alteration of the repair response 248 11 in the lung can favor bacterial invasion independently from immune cell control (63). In our model  249   immune cell recruitment is not affected by IFN-\u03bb and neutrophils are dispensable for the impaired  250   control of bacterial infections, while IFN-\u03bb signaling on epithelial cells is necessary and sufficient  251 to cause heightened bacterial invasion. 252",

Two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple-comparison test was used to analyze kinetic experiments. Two-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple-comparison test was used to analyze experiments with 2 grouped variables (i.e. treatment, genotype). Statistical significance for survival curves were evaluated with the Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test and corrected for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni's correction. To establish the appropriate test, normal distribution and variance similarity were assessed with the D'Agostino-Pearson omnibus normality test using Prism8 (Graphpad) software. When comparisons between only two groups were made, an unpaired two-tailed t-test was used to assess statistical significance. To determine the sample size, calculations were conducted in nQuery Advisor Version 7.0. Primary outcomes for each proposed experiment were selected for the sample size calculation and sample sizes adequate to detect differences with an 80% power were selected. For animal experiments, four to ten mice per group were used, as indicated in the Cells were gated on FSC and SSC to eliminate debris, on FSC-A -FSC-H to select single cells and cells negative for live/dead dye and Lineage markers (CD3, CD19, Ter119). Epithelial cells were gated as CD45 -EpCAM + CD31 -. The EpCAMcells were sorted for immune cells as follows: aMac were gated as CD45 + Ly6g -CD11c hi Siglec-F + , monocytes and monocyte-derived cells (Mo) were gated as CD45 + Ly6g -Siglec-F -Ly6C + , cDCs were gated as CD45 + Ly6g -Siglec-F -Ly6C -CD11c + MHC-II hi .

Having established that DCs are the main cell type 198 involved in IFN-\u03bb production, we analyzed the relevance of the three main RNA virus recognition 199 pathways in the induction of IFN-\u03bb in dendritic cells (i.e. TLR7-MyD88, RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS, TLR3-200 TRIF). We thus generated DCs from FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L)-derived bone 201 marrow cell cultures (FLT3L-DCs). In vitro derived FLT3L-DCs comprise plasmacytoid DCs 202 (pDCs), cDC1 and cDC2 like cells (53) and are well suited to model tissue DC responses in vitro. 203 IFN-\u03bb was induced only when the TLR3-TRIF pathway was activated by administering poly (I:C) 204 in the supernatant, while neither stimulation of the RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS pathway by intracellular 205 delivery of poly (I:C), nor stimulation of TLR7 were able to induce IFN-\u03bb (Fig. 4D).

            "text": ", as indicated by their poor ability to induce IFN responses in 259 vitro in epithelial cells (31). Indeed, severe clinical manifestations and surge of IFN and cytokine 260 production are evident after the initial infection has peaked, as demonstrated by the analysis of 261 the BAL of ICU-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. 262IFN-\u03bb has recently been proposed as a therapeutic agent for COVID-19 infections (13), 263 and clinical trials have been initiated for mild and early SARS-CoV-2 infections (14) by virtue of 264 its unique antiviral and immune modulatory activity. However, our discovery reveals not only that 265 the most severe COVID-19 patients present high levels of type III IFNs in the lower airways, but 266 also a previously unappreciated capacity of IFN-\u03bb to interfere with repair processes, which renders 267 treatment of severe COVID-19 patients with IFN-\u03bb extremely dangerous. By contrast, existing 268 clinical trials are exploring inhibition of the type II cytokine signaling adaptors Janus Kinases 269 (JAKs) in severe COVID-19 patients (65). In light of our discoveries, inhibition of JAK kinases270 could be successful by both inhibiting detrimental activities of proinflammatory cytokines such as 271 IL-6 and IFN-I, and mitigating the antiproliferative effect of IFN-\u03bb. Intriguingly, in vitro treatment of 272 dendritic cells with chloroquine, a controversial therapeutic proposed against COVID-19(66-68), 273 completely blocks TLR3-dependent IFN-\u03bb production. Whether this inhibitory effect translates in 274 therapeutic settings, and whether it could have beneficial outcomes in COVIDdemonstrate that sustained activation of antiviral immunity in the lungs 277 induces the production over time of high levels of IFN-\u03bb by DCs through the TLR3-TRIF pathway. 278 Prolonged IFN-\u03bb stimulation interferes with tissue repair by inhibiting epithelial cell proliferation 279 and favoring p53 mediated apoptosis. This inhibitory effect toward barrier repair induced by IFN-280 \u03bb can drive immunopathogenesis in severe viral infections and predispose the host to . M. Lazear, J. W. Schoggins, M. S.
