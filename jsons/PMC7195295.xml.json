Mental health providers may also consider adopting phones that allow for end-to-end encryption of text messages by default [e.g., Apple\u2019s Messages to other iOS users; 19,22,23]. If end-to-end encryption is not possible with native software/apps, providers may choose to adopt alternative messaging apps that offer end-to-end encryption [e.g., Signal; 22,24]. Finally, Drolet [22] advises that providers should be wary of claims of \u2018Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA; 25]-compliant\u2019 text messaging services (p. 2369). \u2018HIPAA-compliant\u2019 is not a regulated or certified term by the Department of Health and Human Services.

In fact, 16.8% of security breaches reportedly occurred due to the loss/theft of a smartphone [11]. Elsewhere, while providers may be tempted to utilize new biometric data security measures for securing and unlocking their phones (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition), a recent U.S. District Court case ruled that law enforcement can legally compel users to unlock their phones via such biometric data [55]. Situations where providers are likely to engage with law enforcement (e.g., international border crossings) present additional threats to client confidentiality of stored text messages. Because prior U.S. case law [e.g., 56] protects individuals from being compelled to reveal number passwords to law enforcement (but not biometric data), providers may consider adopting numerical passwords over biometric data security measures in their professional practice [57].",

The use of email, text messaging, TMHT, electronic medical records, cloud-based storage, apps, and digital assessments have all aided providers in their search for efficient and effective care. Moreover, in the face of pandemics or other crises such as COVID-19 (Coronavirus), technology has empowered providers to continue seeing clients from afar when in-person meetings are impossible (e.g., APA\u2019s [75] Disaster Mental Health informed consent checklist for telepsychological services).",

In the face of growing need for technology in practice, providers should consider opportunities for growth and education before use. Providers should engage with relevant literature, attend conferences and continuing education opportunities, and solicit feedback from colleagues, as these actions will likely benefit their work and clients.
