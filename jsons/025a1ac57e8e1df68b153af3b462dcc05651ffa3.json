We note a further leap forward along the direction of earlier curriculum reforms in the curriculum and assessment guides. The importance of promoting students' understanding of NOS is more explicitly spelt out. To put greater emphasis on environmental issues, students' appreciation of STS is extended to STSE, where \"E\" stands for environment. For example, in the physics curriculum, students are expected to \"appreciate and understand the nature of science in physics-related contexts,\" \"develop skills for making scientific inquiries,\" \"be aware of the social, ethical, economic, environmental and technological implications of physics, and develop an attitude of responsible citizenship,\" and \"make informed decisions and judgments on physics-related issues\" (CDC-HKEAA, 2007, p. 4 ). There is a clear intention to develop students' awareness and understanding of issues associated with the interconnections among science, technology, society, and the environment. A separate subsection entitled STSE connections is embedded in each science topic of the Curriculum and Assessment Guides.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 92, "end": 109, "text": "(CDC-HKEAA, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 875, "end": 897, "text": "(CDC-HKEAA, 2007, p. 4", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "It suggests examples of issues that teachers could make use of in developing students' awareness and understanding of STSE connections.

In particular, we have been cognizant of the disappointing conclusions that were consistently reached by various studies. That is, both students and science teachers have inadequate understanding of NOS (Lederman, 1992) and STSE (Rubba & Harkness, 1993) . There is however emerging empirical evidence that can inform efforts to improve NOS and STSE understandings. Explicit and reflective approaches in teaching NOS can support learner development of sophisticated NOS ideas (Abd-El-Khalick & Lederman, 2000; Khishfe & Abd-El-Khalick, 2002) . Teachers with good understanding in NOS still face many constraints including concerns for student abilities and motivation (Abd-El-Khalick, Bell, & Lederman, 1998; Brickhouse & Bodner, 1992) , lack of pedagogical skills in teaching NOS (Schwartz & Lederman, 2002) , and lack of teaching resources (Bianchini, Johnston, Oram, & Cavazos, 2003) particularly those in local contexts and language (Tsai, 2001) . Effective NOS teaching also depends on teachers' belief in the importance of teaching NOS (Lederman, 1999; Tobin & McRobbie, 1997) and their conception of appropriate learning goals and teaching role (Bartholomew, Osborne, & Ratcliffe, 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 366, "end": 382, "text": "(Lederman, 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 392, "end": 416, "text": "(Rubba & Harkness, 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 656, "end": 671, "text": "Lederman, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 672, "end": 703, "text": "Khishfe & Abd-El-Khalick, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 830, "end": 870, "text": "(Abd-El-Khalick, Bell, & Lederman, 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 871, "end": 897, "text": "Brickhouse & Bodner, 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 943, "end": 970, "text": "(Schwartz & Lederman, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1048, "text": "(Bianchini, Johnston, Oram, & Cavazos, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1111, "text": "(Tsai, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1220, "text": "(Lederman, 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1221, "end": 1244, "text": "Tobin & McRobbie, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1314, "end": 1355, "text": "(Bartholomew, Osborne, & Ratcliffe, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Preparing Teachers for the New Curriculum Goals"}, {"text": "In addition to the problems identified above, Hong Kong teachers very rarely have experienced learning of NOS or STSE during their own schooling. Noting teachers' inadequate NOS understanding and hence their lack of appreciation and less than effective use of the NOS instructional materials, we then restructured our teacher training programs to allow more time on these aspects. For example, in early 2000s, we proposed the use of science stories, such as on the discovery of penicillin, the development of cowpox, Newton's proposition of Law of Universal Gravitation, and the treatment of stomach ulcers (Tao, 2002) , as a medium through which NOS could be introduced to students. However, due to the lack of both understanding of NOS and experience in learning and teaching NOS, many teachers made use of them only for arousing students' interest. Hence, the availability of teaching resources would not by itself result in teachers' learning of NOS and an effective teaching of NOS. Unless teachers had the ability to understand and appreciate the rationales behind the design of the instructional materials, it was likely that they would overlook or miss the targeted learning objectives (learning NOS features) and gravitate toward the parts which were more appealing to them (dramatic stories which promote students' interest). Such a situation was reflected in the comment made by a junior science teacher who had been telling the interesting science stories to his students. He came to realize his oversight of not having made good use of the stories for teaching NOS after he attended our NOS training workshop: I found the story on stomach ulcers very interesting\u2026.Marshall tested his hypothesis by trialling out himself\u2026.Students all enjoyed the story\u2026 I only realised now that there are deeper meanings behind the story and other important learning outcomes to be achieved through it and other stories.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 607, "end": 618, "text": "(Tao, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Preparing Teachers for the New Curriculum Goals"}, {"text": "We also reckoned that there were some inadequacies of these relatively \"old\" stories.

The SARS incident was a unique experience that everyone in Hong Kong had lived through and the memories of which would stay for years to come. At the beginning of the outbreak, the causative agent was not known, the pattern of spread was not identified, mortality and morbidity seemed soaring, yet an effective treatment regimen was uncertain. It attracted the attention of the whole world as scientists worked indefatigably to understand the biology of the disease, develop new diagnostic tests, and design new treatments. Extensive media coverage kept people up-to-date on the latest development of scientific knowledge generated from the scientific inquiry about the disease. We believed that the incident would have much to reveal about NOS.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Preparing Teachers for the New Curriculum Goals"}, {"text": "As anticipated we identified many interesting aspects of NOS based on our interviews with key scientists who played an active role in the SARS research, analysis of media reports, documentaries, and other literature published during and after the SARS epidemic. The SARS incident illustrated vividly some NOS features advocated in the school science curriculum. They included the tentative nature of scientific knowledge, theory-laden observation and interpretation, multiplicity of approaches adopted in scientific inquiry, the inter-relationship between science and technology, and the nexus of science, politics, social, and cultural practices. The incident also provided some insights into a number of NOS features less emphasized in the school curriculum. These features included the need to combine and coordinate expertise in a number of scientific fields, the intense competition between research groups (suspended during the SARS crisis), the significance of affective issues relating to intellectual honesty, the courage to challenge authority, and the pressure of funding issues on the conduct of research.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Preparing Teachers for the New Curriculum Goals"}, {"text": "The details on how we made use of the news reports and documentaries on SARS, together with episodes from the scientists' interviews to explicitly teach the prominent features of NOS can be found in (Wong, Kwan, Hodson, & Yung, 2009 ). Since January 2005, we have been using the SARS story in the training of hundreds of preservice and in-service science teachers about NOS. The feedback has been encouraging. The SARS story was particularly successful in promoting teachers' understanding of NOS in terms of (1) the realization of inseparable links between science and the social, cultural, and political environment, (2) deeper understanding of how science and technology impact on each other, and (3) a richer appreciation of the processes of authentic scientific inquiry and the humanistic character of scientists. The effectiveness was mainly attributed to immediacy, relevance, and familiarity of the SARS story which made the abstract tangible. Teachers' personal experience of this unique piece of \"history\" of science and the powerful affective impact of the interviews with scientists also contributed to the favorable learning outcomes (Wong, Hodson, Kwan, & Yung, 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 199, "end": 232, "text": "(Wong, Kwan, Hodson, & Yung, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1147, "end": 1181, "text": "(Wong, Hodson, Kwan, & Yung, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Preparing Teachers for the New Curriculum Goals"}, {"text": "The encouraging results of using the SARS story with teachers prompted us to produce NOS instructional materials that should also be grounded in the local contexts (and language) for school students. At the same time, we were fully aware that high quality curriculum materials do not automatically result in student learning. Such materials have to be mediated by teachers with necessary content knowledge, pedagogical skills, beliefs, and intention of meeting the curriculum goals (Bartholomew et al., 2004; Lumpe, Haney, & Czerniak 1998; Schwartz & Lederman, 2002) . Thus, in September 2005, we embarked on a 2-year project which aimed to produce local NOS/STSE curriculum resources while preparing more teachers for NOS/STSE teaching. We also envisioned that the project was timely in view of the new science curricula to be implemented in 2009. Having made reference to the reminder by Hodson (2006) that, [a] ction research offers the most likely route to such far reaching curriculum changes, committed teachers work together in mutually supportive groups to address the theoretical and practical issues surrounding the implementation of a learning about science curriculum and to develop suitable and effective curriculum resources. Curriculum materials need to have a \"street credibility\" that can only be gained when they are developed by teachers, for teachers. (p. 305) we deliberately involved teachers at the beginning stages of the design process of instructional materials. More than 50 senior secondary science teachers worked together with the university team members to develop 12 sets 1 of teaching resources which integrate NOS knowledge with subject knowledge of the new senior secondary biology, chemistry, and physics curricula. Efforts were made to include as many local examples as possible. The topics included development of the Disneyland in Hong Kong, consumption of shark fins, an abridged version of the SARS story, etc. In doing so, teachers would be more ready to make use of the materials in their own classrooms. This was important for our project as we wanted to collect data to refine the teaching materials as well as provide opportunities for the teachers to learn how to teach NOS with the support of the university team members. In brief, the teacher development project comprised the following key components: 1. A 6-h NOS session conducted by the first author using SARS and other contexts in illustrating various aspects of NOS. 2. Workshops on refinement of NOS instructional materials drafted by the university team members. 3. Prelesson discussion with the university team member(s) on the main ideas and fine adjustment of the instructional materials to be tried out in the teacher's own classroom. 4. Teaching the lesson(s) using the instructional materials. 5. Reviewing the lesson video and reflecting on the trial lesson(s). 6. Meeting between the university team member(s) and the teacher to discuss critical incidents in the videotaped lesson (followed by written feedback from university team members) in preparation for a sharing session with other inservice teachers joining this project (teacher members). 7. Sharing of the trial-run experience with other in-service teachers of the project and receiving their comments. 8. Dissemination seminar: Over 500 teachers from other schools in Hong Kong attended. Sharing of teaching materials and trial-run experiences with a wide audience.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 482, "end": 508, "text": "(Bartholomew et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 509, "end": 539, "text": "Lumpe, Haney, & Czerniak 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 540, "end": 566, "text": "Schwartz & Lederman, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 890, "end": 903, "text": "Hodson (2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 910, "end": 913, "text": "[a]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Preparing Teachers for the New Curriculum Goals"}, {"text": "Due to the limited financial and human resources, seven of the teacher participants went through all the above training components. The rest participated only in components (1), (2), (7), and (8). The development of the seven teachers in the understanding of NOS, the pedagogical skills in teaching NOS, and the intention to teach about NOS were probed at various stages of the project. These teachers found learning through a contextual approach, as what they did in the NOS workshop, very effective in promoting, enriching, and consolidating their NOS understanding. They also treasured both the training materials and some activities in the teaching resources that they tried out in their classroom as they could modify or had modified them to incorporate teaching of NOS in their teaching of subject knowledge teaching. The actual classroom implementation and detailed review and discussion of the lesson video \"worked best\" and more importantly were \"treasured most\" by the teachers in enhancing their pedagogical skills in teaching NOS and intention to teach NOS. The review and analysis of the lesson videos facilitated teachers' reflection on which areas needed improvement. It also allowed them to appreciate and value the teaching of NOS when they saw students' ability and interest in learning NOS. The proof of workability of both teaching and learning NOS had prompted teachers who were reserved about teaching NOS to follow suit.

Thus in September 2008, we initiated another 2-year professional development project. It aimed to cultivate a mutually supportive environment where teachers would collaborate and develop their pedagogical content knowledge of NOS. A key feature of the new project was the formation of study groups among teachers of the same subject discipline from different schools (subject-based approach) and science teachers of the same school (school-based approach). We believe that putting like-minded teachers together in a study group is more likely to sustain and even enhance their commitment to teach NOS. While retaining the components that teachers who participated in the previous project valued and treasured most (such as the SARS case study, the detailed review and discussion on their lesson videos with the university team members and their peers, etc.), we also encouraged teachers not to simply modify and adapt the available teaching resources, but to proactively design their own instructional materials. This is indeed a goal that we wish teachers could ultimately achieve. Thus at the outset of the current project, we explained our intention to the teachers by a Chinese proverb, \"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.\" (In Chinese, it says \u6388\u4eba\u4ee5\u9b5a,\u4e09\u9910\u4e4b\u9700;\u6388\u4eba\u4ee5\u6f01,\u7d42\u751f\u4e4b\u7528\u3002 ).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Preparing Teachers for the New Curriculum Goals"}, {"text": "Two physics teachers, Wayne and Kyle, who were from the same school, participated in the school-based approach of the project (with three other colleagues teaching other science subjects).

In the following sections, we expound on their learning and teaching experience in the current project by covering in detail three important components that they found most helpful in their development, namely (1) contextual learning of NOS through SSIs in the SARS crisis and other related contexts, (2) viewing and responding to videos of exemplary practice of NOS teaching; (3) their own practice of designing and implementing a NOS lesson.

Though none of these studies focused specifically on NOS understanding, we successfully demonstrated that the use of the SARS context with a number of remarkable SSIs was effective in enhancing NOS understanding (Wong et al., 2008) . This provided support to the compelling arguments that critical consideration of SSIs offers an ideal forum for students to deploy and develop their NOS understanding (Sadler, 2004; Zeidler, Sadler, Simmons, & Howe, 2005) , especially when the issues are controversial (Kolstoe, 2000; Oulton, Dillon, & Grace, 2004) or have strong personal relevance (Ryder, 2002) . Khishfe and Lederman (2006) remind us that although locating NOS teaching within controversial topics (in their case, discussion of global warming) can be effective, the essential requirement, as in internship and apprenticeship approaches, is that NOS teaching is both explicit and supportive of critical reflection. The case study of SARS contextualized in many examples of SSIs was intensely personal for our learners and had many controversial aspects.

First, both lessons used timely contexts that were relevant to learners. SARS has captured much attention of all people in Hong Kong where it was most hard-hit by the epidemic. Thus it has been highly relevant to teachers in Hong Kong and its timeliness would last for years due to the unforgettable experience and the scare of a similar crisis due to another outbreak, like the recent swine flu. For Wayne and Kyle's lesson, sports have been mostly liked by teenage students. Wayne and Kyle deliberately included examples of a diverse range of sports. Kyle reminded us that the effectiveness would be enhanced if the teachers also find the context relevant. He said, \"I love sports very much and enjoy looking up information about sports\u2026feel excited and at ease when talking about them to students.\" They also capitalized on the timely context of the ban of shark skin swimsuits that happened a couple of months before their lessons. The use of the return of Liu Xiang (favorite sports star of many Hong Kong students) to the 110 m-hurdle competition 2 days before their lessons was both timely and relevant to the students. Students were obviously attracted to the many video clips of sports competitions and sports training used by them in the lesson. Similarly, the SARS teacher training materials also made heavy use of videos of scientists who fought against SARS and documentaries produced by reputable media about the inside story of SARS. Teachers felt excited to hear these inside stories. These videos were immensely helpful in the reconstruction of the relevant SSIs to give learners a sense of authenticity about the events shown. This is the second common feature of the SARS training materials and Kyle and Wayne's instructional materials that motivated the learners. Third, both lessons engaged learners in critically reflecting on dilemmas, issues, and problems faced in decision making. Instead of being a purely rational and logical exercise, such decision making mandated considerations of social demands, sentiments of public, incomplete scientific findings and possible consequences to different stakeholders, etc.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Implications for Professional Development"}, {"text": "Although we have reported the unique features of the SARS instructional materials that may account for its effectiveness in promoting teachers' understanding of NOS (Wong et al., 2008) , we have not shared these features explicitly with the teacher participants who joined our professional development project. Our oversight was due to our belief that another similar incident as SARS would be unlikely, which embodied so many NOS features in one case. It was interesting to find that Kyle and Wayne somehow translated some of the unique features of the SARS training session to their teaching of NOS. Kyle and Wayne's lesson demonstrated that the same features could still be nicely applied to a simple SSI embedded with just a few NOS aspects. Indeed Kyle said that he felt fairly at ease in running the role play activity as he had experience using one of the sets of teaching resources, LASIK, developed in our previous project from 2005 to 2007. In the LASIK package, there was an activity in which students were asked to advise, with justification, people of different backgrounds, careers, and eye problems whether they are suitable for taking laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery. Kyle further commented that if he had not used the LASIK package, it would have been quite daunting for him to design a lesson teaching STSE on his own. I used the LASIK package before\u2026all information are there\u2026I didn't need to prepare anything extra, only implemented the activities\u2026After the implementation, I felt relatively easily to design a new one\u2026. If I have to design one right from the beginning, it would be hard. But if there is a sample, like LASIK\u2026also on STS\u2026I can follow it like a model. The learning of Wayne and Kyle seems to suggest that teachers did learn from exemplars, or through the modeling of exemplars. They were able to make use of some features of exemplar SSIs, and to apply them in designing novel SSIs that fitted the needs of their students. The capability of identifying key features of exemplar materials and transferring such features to personalized teaching resources seems to be essential for teachers' development. Developing such capability seems to be a way for our future teacher training programs.
