Our aim was to determine the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at exon 7 splice acceptor site (SAS) of the OAS1 gene in relation to the interferon response and status of HCV infection. Methods: A 203 bp fragment containing exon 7 SAS was amplified in 70 HCV chronic patients and 50 healthy controls. SNP was examined using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) genotyping method. Correlations of SNP genotypes with response to interferon and clinical status of patients were statistically analyzed. Results: There was an increasing trend of response from AA to AG to GG genotypes (P = 0.007). Genotype AA was associated with non-response to interferon and higher degree of liver fibrosis (P = 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed this SNP as independent and a significant determinant of the outcome of interferon therapy (odds ratio 4.913 [95% confidence interval 1.365-8.2], P = 0.006). Conclusions: This is the first study to show a significant association between the functional SNP at exon 7 SAS of OAS1 gene and the viral response to interferon in chronic HCV patients. Patients with AA genotype were associated with progressive HCV disease and viral resistance to interferon therapy. This OAS SNP is a potential bio-marker to predict IFN response in chronic hepatitis C patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The current recommended treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the combination of pegylated alpha interferon (IFN) and ribavirin given for 24 or 48 weeks. [1] [2] [3] Both viral and host factors may contribute to the phenomenon that some patients with chronic hepatitis C respond well to IFN therapy but others do not. 4, 5 Specifically, viral factors, such as genotype 1 and high HCV RNA levels are associated with a higher incidence of resistance to IFN therapy. Also, host factors, such as old age, advanced fibrosis, long duration of disease and host genetic factors can adversely influence the response to IFN treatment. [6] [7] [8] The host genetic factors mediate the vigor of the immune response of the host through the control of inter-individual differences in the production of intra-cellular antiviral proteins or some cytokines. 9, 10 These interindividual differences may be attributable to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome, which significantly influence the progression of chronic HCV infection and response to therapy. 11, 12 Biological activity of IFN therapy is mediated by the induction of intracellular antiviral proteins, such as 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), dsRNA activated protein kinase (PKR) and MxA protein. 6, 13, 14 The 2\u2032-5\u2032 OAS protein has selective activity against several viruses. It requires double stranded (ds) RNA structures, such as viral genomes, to become activated. The activated enzyme then catalyzes the polymerization of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into 2\u2032,5\u2032 linked oligoadenylates, and these, in turn, bind to and activate latent ribonuclease L (RNaseL), which degrades viral RNA and inhibits protein synthesis. The 2\u2032-5\u2032 OAS-RNaseL system may also be involved in growth and apoptosis. 15, 16 The 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase genes comprise a gene family (OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3). The OAS1 gene, located on human chromosome 12q24.2, encodes the p42, p44, p46, and p48 isoforms. 17 The importance of OAS1 for clearing viral infections has been demonstrated in different studies. [18] [19] [20] In humans, it was reported that basal activity of OAS1 varies among individuals and is associated with susceptibility to diabetes mellitus type 1, whose pathogenesis is thought to involve enterovirus infections. 21 Furthermore, previous analysis of human OAS1 response to yellow fever vaccine revealed a highly significant correlation between basal enzyme activity and virus-stimulated activity measured 7 days after vaccination. 22 Actually, in HCV patients, several findings were reported regarding OAS1 (i) HCV core protein specifically activated the 40/46-kDa OAS1 gene promoter in a dose-dependent manner in different human hepatocyte derived cell lines. (ii) The activation by core protein was further enhanced in the cells treated with alpha interferon. 23 (iii) The induced levels of OAS1 were lower in poor-responder patients than in marked-or intermediate-responder patients. 24 Thus, any genetic variants that affect OAS1 activity could be important determinants of susceptibility/resistance to antiviral treatment and to virus-related disease progression. Although OAS1 is critical in antiviral interaction, its sequence is not strictly conserved. There are eight SNPs in exons, 24 SNPs in introns, three in promoters and one in the 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of the OAS1 gene. It was reported that more than 12 genetic markers in OAS1 were strongly associated with enzyme activity. 21, 25 The strongest genetic association with OAS1 activity occurred at exon 7 SAS of the OAS1 gene, in which the sequence AG is required for normal splicing at this site. The G allele at this acceptor site retains the splice site and is associated with high enzyme activity p46, whereas the A allele (AA at acceptor site) ablates the splice site and is associated with low enzyme activity p48 and p52. 25 Ghosh et al. 26 reported that the basal OAS1 activity is higher in persons carrying the G (p46) allele than in those having only the A (p48/p52) allele. These findings suggest strong genetic control of OAS1 basal activity and the genetic polymorphism at exon 7 SAS makes OAS1 an excellent candidate for a human gene that can significantly influence the host susceptibility to viral infection, affect the disease progression and the response to IFN therapy in patients with hepatitis C or hepatitis B viral infection. 10, 27, 28 In the present study, we investigated 70 Egyptian HCV genotype 4a infected patients and 50 healthy individuals as controls to determine if the genetic SNP in the exon 7 SAS of the human OAS1 gene is associated with reduced response to IFN based therapy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 175, "end": 178, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 179, "end": 182, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 183, "end": 186, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 339, "end": 341, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 342, "end": 343, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 646, "end": 649, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 650, "end": 653, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 654, "end": 657, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 862, "end": 864, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 865, "end": 867, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1081, "end": 1084, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1085, "end": 1087, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1290, "end": 1292, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1293, "end": 1296, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1297, "end": 1299, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1789, "end": 1792, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1793, "end": 1795, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1982, "end": 1984, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2082, "end": 2086, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2087, "end": 2091, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2092, "end": 2096, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2309, "end": 2311, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2527, "end": 2529, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2858, "end": 2860, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2983, "end": 2985, "text": "24", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3494, "end": 3497, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3498, "end": 3500, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3897, "end": 3899, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3913, "end": 3915, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 4417, "end": 4420, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 4421, "end": 4424, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 4425, "end": 4427, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Seventy patients with proven chronic hepatitis C who received pegylated IFN + ribavirin treatment and 50 healthy controls (negative for HCV Ab and RNA as well as hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]) were enrolled in this study.

During the chronic infection, some patients have minimal progression of disease, whereas others develop severe liver disease such as elevated transaminase levels, chronic hepatitis, steatosis, liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. 33 Both host and viral factors are thought to influence HCV disease outcome and response to IFN treatment. Since more than 93% of patients in Egypt are infected with HCV genotype 4 34 it seemed more applicable to carry out the current study on patients infected with genotype 4a who receive the pegylated IFN + ribavirin at doses mentioned in the methods section. Host genetic factors that affect the outcome of IFN treatment in chronic hepatitis C have been investigated. Several SNPs in IFNinducible genes leading to altered gene expression or function were found to be associated with divergent responses to IFN treatment. 28, [35] [36] [37] Understanding which patients are likely to develop persistent infection, progressive liver disease or not responding significantly to interferon therapy would be of utmost importance in disease control programs. In this study we showed that a specific human mutation that results in reduced function in a known antiviral gene OAS1 is associated with resistance to interferon therapy in HCV infected patients. OAS1 codes for a component of the type I interferon signaling system; its homolog in mice has been shown previously to be important for flavivirus susceptibility. 38 Our observations suggested that polymorphisms at exon 7 splice-acceptor site in the OAS1 gene may be involved in determining the outcome of HCV infection. Patients harboring GG genotype at this site tend to achieve sustained response to interferon therapy (59.4%) suggesting that the G allele conferred a better signaling towards viral clearance. On the other hand, a clear association exists between both allele A containing genotypes, that is GA and AA and resistance to interferon therapy (62% and 89%, respectively). These findings confirmed earlier reports that the G allele at this acceptor site retained the splice site and was associated with a higher OAS enzyme activity (P46), whereas the A allele (AA at acceptor site) ablated the splice site and resulted in a larger molecular weight protein with a lower OAS enzyme activity (P48). 25, 26 The role of OAS enzyme activity in combating other viral infections has been previously documented, a SNP in exon 3 of OAS1 was related to the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, a coronavirus infection). 10 Recently, Lim et al. 39 reported that individuals carrying two copies of the hypofunctional variant of OAS1 were found more frequently than expected among both asymptomatic and symptomatic West Nile Virus (WNV) positive individuals and further proved that OAS1 activity influences the probability of WNV initial infection upon exposure in man. To our knowledge, there are no previous reports on the effects of different OAS1 genotypes at exon 7 splice acceptor site on the response rate of HCV infected patients to combined interferon + ribavirin therapy. Knapp et al. 37 reported that different genotypes at specific SNPs within the 3\u2032UTR of OAS1 gene were not associated with differential response to IFN therapy but more likely were associated with persistent infection of patients. Moreover, Li et al. 40 showed no relationship of a SNP in exon 3 of OAS1 gene and IFN treatment response. Okuno et al., hypothesized that OAS1 plays a greater role in mediating self-limiting versus persistent HCV infections as a component of the innate immune system and an IFN stimulated gene than its role in exogenously administered IFN treatment. The current data support this hypothesis, since the SNP allele (AA or GA) of the OAS1 gene was slightly overrepresented in HCV patients (13%, 42%) compared with the controls (9%, 38%, respectively). This finding indicates that OAS1 plays a role in persistence of HCV infection. On the contrary, the splice-acceptor site specific SNP studied here exhibits a deleterious effect on OAS1 enzyme activity and hence is expected to dramatically influence the IFN mediated signal transduction pathway. It was presumed that GA and AA genotypes could negatively affect the suppressive function of OAS of HCV replication, and may therefore be related to sustained inflammation and progression of liver disease. This hypothesis was supported by results of the present study in which the hepatic fibrosis score was higher in AA and GA genotypes compared with the GG genotype. Chronic HCV patients with positive A allele had significantly higher fibrosis scores (\u0546 F2 metavir) than those observed in patients without A allele (88.9% in AA and 62% in GA vs 43.7% in GG, P = 0.05). Interestingly, fibrosis scores were higher in OAS variants including allele A at exon 7 SAS in a gene dose-dependent fashion; that is, the more A allele in OAS exon 7 SAS, the more F score in a patient's liver. On the other hand there was no significant association between different OAS genotypes and liver activity (P = 0.22). This may be explained by the fact that A allele encodes p48 with a weak ability to suppress HCV replication compared with OAS1 having G allele coding for the more active enzyme p46. 25 Thus, the presence here of A allele may lead to a higher degree of necrosis, regeneration and ultimately higher degree of fibrosis. These latter findings support the previous results of Li et al. 40 who found that the SNP of OAS-1 at exon 3 was associated with disease progression in Japanese patients with HCV infection. In general, the effects of different OAS genotypes on the liver disease progression in HCV patients need to be further studied.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 404, "end": 406, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 585, "end": 587, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1030, "end": 1033, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1038, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1039, "end": 1043, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1044, "end": 1048, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1621, "end": 1623, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2468, "end": 2471, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2472, "end": 2474, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2700, "end": 2702, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2724, "end": 2726, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 3272, "end": 3274, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 3499, "end": 3511, "text": "Li et al. 40", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5417, "end": 5419, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 5616, "end": 5618, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "There have been relatively few studies aimed at identifying the human genetic differences that influence progression to chronic viral infection and response to interferon. 44 Recently, a SNP has been identified located upstream of the IL28B gene that encodes IFN-l3, which is strongly associated with the sustained virological response to pegIFN and ribavirin in HCV-infected patients. 45, 46 Matsushita et al. 35 showed an association between polymorphism of the mannose-binding lectin gene and IFN responsiveness of Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis C. Moreover, Hijikata et al. 36 showed that a SNP (G/T at nt -88) in the promoter region of the MxA gene was associated with response to IFN in Japanese HCV patients. It is possible that other host proteins with different functions may also be associated, via diverse mechanisms, with the response to IFN in chronic HCV patients. The present multivariate analysis results indicate that the OAS1 gene polymorphism is not the only factor that influences the IFN-induced antiviral activities of host cells against viral infection. However, multivariate analysis showed that the SNP of OAS-1 at the exon 7 splice acceptor site as independent and significant determinants of the outcome of IFN therapy (odds ratio 4.913 [95% confidence interval 1.365-8.2], P = 0.006).
