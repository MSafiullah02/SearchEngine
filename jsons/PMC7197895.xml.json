            "text": "TGEV is an enveloped virus with a positive\u2010stranded RNA genome and belongs to the family Coronaviridae. The viral particle of TGEV is composed of four identified structural proteins: the spike (S), the integral membrane (M), the minor envelope (E) and the nucleocapsid (N) (Spaan et al. 1988; Ren et al. 2008). TGEV S protein is a major viral antigen and can elicit the neutralizing antibodies in hosts (Jim\u00e9nez et al. 1986). The interaction between the S protein and porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), the cellular receptor of TGEV, mediates the virus entry and subsequent membrane fusion (Delmas et al. 1992; Liu et al. 2009). Consequently, the S protein of TGEV can be selected as a candidate for antigen detection and vaccine design. Four major antigenic sites (A, B, C and D) located on the amino\u2010terminal half of protein S have been identified (Delmas et al. 1990). In this study, using the bacterially expressed TGEV S1 protein and hybridoma technique, four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the S1 protein were generated and characterized. The availability and utility of these mAbs are helpful for detecting and analysing TGEV infection.",

Therefore, the N\u2010terminal half of the S gene (S1 gene) was expressed in the E. coli system because this system has advantages consisting of low cost, convenience and high fermentation potential (Yin et al. 2007). Many heterologous proteins have been expressed in this system (2010a, 2010b, 2010c). In this study, the S1 protein of TGEV was expressed in the same system and used to immunize BALB/c mice. Using conventional hybridoma techniques, four positive mAbs against the S1 protein of TGEV were generated, and the isotype of 3G2 is IgG3.
