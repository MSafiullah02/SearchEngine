It is evident that the salutary effects of exogenously administrated MSCs on tissue repair arise from their immunoregulatory effect, a function that is licensed by inflammation [2\u20135]. A series of factors and molecules produced by human MSCs, like IDO and TSG-6, have been shown to be critical for their immune-regulating function [4].

Notably, IDO has been shown to regulate inflammation-associated gene expression, either by itself as a signaling factor, or through the generation of bioactive intermediates via the kynurenine pathway, such as 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and kynurenic acid (KYNA) [12\u201314].",

TSG-6 is a secreted protein that could modulate the extracellular matrix by binding to serine protease inhibitor inter-\u03b1-inhibitor and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) [19]. Through its interaction with the GAG-binding site of CXCL8, it antagonizes the association of CXCL8 with heparin, thus inhibiting CXCL8-mediated chemotaxis by neutrophils [20]. Moreover, it has been reported to inhibit the extravasation of leukocytes, mainly neutrophils and macrophages, at sites of inflammation [15, 21].",

In the present study, we found that IDO in MSCs controls TSG-6 expression and its indispensable roles in restriction of leukocyte extravasation in inflammatory diseases. Detailed analysis demonstrated that IDO metabolite, KYNA, specifically regulates TSG-6 production by activating aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). More importantly, KYNA-pretreated MSCs can further boost TSG-6 production and thus enhance the therapeutic capacity of human MSCs against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Therefore, our study reveals a novel link between IDO and TSG-6 in human MSCs, a finding that will allow better optimization of MSC-based clinical treatments for inflammatory conditions.",

Various factors have been demonstrated to mediate MSC-based immunosuppression in both in vivo and in vitro experimental systems [22]. Among them, IDO is pivotal in mediating the suppressive effect of human MSCs on adaptive immune responses, since blockade of IDO expression or its function in human MSCs can disrupt their immunosuppressive function [6, 7]. Yet, little is known about its role of IDO in MSC-based regulation of innate immune response, especially in in vivo settings. To address this, we firstly employed MSCs derived from human umbilical cord (hUC-MSCs; Supplementary Fig. 1), and established stable IDO knockdown (IDO-KD) cell line using lentivirus transfection (Fig. 1a). Next, we employed the LPS-induced ALI model in BALB/c mice through intranasal administration of LPS. These mice showed increased number of total cells and neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid at 48 h after LPS administration (Figs. 1a, b). Their lung histology also exhibited widespread septal thickening, significant increases in air-space cellularity and exudation, and significant interstitial immune cell infiltration (Fig. 1c). Using this model we examined the therapeutic effect of control MSCs and IDO-KD MSCs. After pretreatment with IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, MSCs were injected intravenously after LPS administration. As expected, administration of control MSCs resulted in significant alleviation of lung inflammation, as indicated both by cell number in BAL fluid and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of lung tissue sections. In contrast, when IDO-KD MSCs were used, the inflammatory status was unaffected compared to control group, indicating that IDO is important in mediating the therapeutic role of MSCs (Figs. 1a\u2013c). To further confirm the role of IDO on the infiltration of neutrophils, we next performed immunohistological staining for Gr-1, a well-known marker of neutrophils. As expected, decreased neutrophil infiltration was found in control MSC-treated mice, while IDO-KD MSC treatment abolished this effect (Fig. 1d). Thus, our results demonstrate that IDO is indispensable in the therapeutic effect of human MSCs on mouse ALI.",

As IDO is critical in the therapeutic effect of MSCs on ALI, we next examined whether this effect is exerted through regulating the expression of any of these molecules. We first checked the expression profile of these factors in IDO-KD cells. We found that TSG-6 production was dramatically inhibited in IDO-KD MSCs on both the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2a). To exclude any off-target effect, we also performed small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection to knockdown IDO and found that TSG-6 expression was similarly reduced (Supplementary Fig. 2). These data suggested that IDO could regulate TSG-6 expression in MSCs. Interestingly, when we looked at the expression of other molecules, we found that the expression levels of Ang-1 or KGF were unaffected (Figs. 2b, c), and IL-1R\u03b1 expression was not detectable (data not shown). Therefore, the regulatory effect of IDO on TSG-6 is specific, and it is possible that IDO-mediated therapeutic effect of MSCs on ALI is exerted through TSG-6.",

We next employed this cell line and recombinant human TSG-6 protein (rhTSG-6) to verify the role of TSG-6. After the treatment of exogenous rhTSG-6, we found that ALI was significantly alleviated, as evidenced by reduced number of infiltrated immune cells, specifically neutrophils, in the lung. In contrast, TSG-6-KD MSCs had little therapeutic effect (Figs. 3a\u2013d). These data suggest that IDO expressed by MSCs alleviates ALI through regulating the expression of TSG-6. To further verify the role of TSG-6, we co-inject IDO-KD MSCs with rhTSG-6 to ALI mice, and found that the effect of IDO-KD MSCs was completely rescued by rhTSG-6 (Supplementary Fig. 3). To verify whether this relationship between IDO and TSG-6 also exists in other diseases mediated by innate immunity, we next established zymosan-induced peritonitis model, which has been reported to respond to human MSC treatment through secretion of TSG-6 as well [15]. We performed similar treatment and, as expected, the therapeutic effect of control MSCs was impaired in this peritonitis model when the expression of either IDO or TSG-6 was compromised. In addition, not only neutrophil, but also macrophage infiltration was regulated in a similar pattern (Supplementary Fig. 4). Collectively, our in vivo results demonstrate that the therapeutic effects of human MSCs in certain inflammatory diseases is exerted through IDO-regulated TSG-6 expression, implicating a regulatory role of IDO on the production of TSG-6 by MSCs.",

When we measured the expression of IDO by cytokine-activated TSG-6-KD MSCs, we found that the absence of TSG-6 did not affect IDO expression (Supplementary Fig. 5A). Furthermore, when we examined the IDO-mediated immunosuppressive effect of MSCs on T cells, we found that, compared to control MSCs, IDO-KD MSCs lost their ability to inhibit T cells as expected, and TSG-6-KD MSCs could still significantly suppress T-cell proliferation in vitro. This confirmed that TSG-6 has no effect on IDO expression and the subsequent suppression of T cells (Supplementary Fig. 5B). Of note, TSG-6 is itself immunosuppressive, and it acts by regulating the extracellular matrix [20, 21]. Thus, it is difficult to accurately measure the function of TSG-6 in an in vitro system. Taken together, these results show that IDO is the critical factor in controlling the production of TSG-6 in human MSCs.",

Since the enzymatic activity of IDO is critical in regulating TSG-6, we next examined the production of the main tryptophan metabolites, which can be inferred by the levels of several key enzymes that strictly control tryptophan metabolism in hUC-MSCs [26]. Surprisingly, among all these enzymes tested, only kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II), which mediates the catalysis of KYN to KYNA, was found to be highly expressed in hUC-MSCs, indicating that KYN and KYNA might be the main tryptophan metabolites (Fig. 4c). Indeed, when examining the concentration of all possible tryptophan metabolites in hUC-MSC supernatant by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), we found that only KYN and KYNA were abundantly produced (Fig. 4d). Next, to explore whether any of these two molecules can affect TSG-6 expression by hUC-MSCs, we treated MSCs with KYN or KYNA, and examined the expression TSG-6. We found that only KYNA-treated MSCs exhibited higher levels of TSG-6, compared to untreated controls (Fig. 4e). The effect of KYNA on TSG-6 expression was further confirmed by the finding that siRNA inhibition of KAT II, resulted in decreased concentration of both KYNA and TSG-6 in the MSC supernatant (Figs. 4f\u2013h). Therefore, IDO promotes the expression of TSG-6 through the production of KYNA, a tryptophan metabolite.",

To investigate the detailed mechanism underlying the regulatory effect of KYNA on TSG-6, we first examined the expression of its receptors in human MSCs. Interestingly, we found that MSCs constitutively expressed very high levels of the AhR gene, compared to the expression of other receptors (Fig. 6a). AhR is one of the most recognized member of the basic helix\u2013loop\u2013helix\u2013PER\u2013ARNT\u2013SIM (bHLH\u2013PAS) subgroup of the bHLH superfamily of transcription factors, which is known to be activated by ligands, including dioxin and the IDO-derived metabolites, KYN and KYNA. Upon interaction with ligands, AhR translocates to the nucleus and forms a heterodimer with AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT), which binds to the xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE) sequences, leading to transcription of a wide variety of genes that participate in various cellular processes [28\u201330]. Therefore, we next examined the nuclear translocation of AhR in MSCs treated with KYNA. We found that KYNA treatment significantly increased the translocation of AhR to the nucleus, indicating that KYNA can activate AhR signaling in MSCs (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Fig. 7A). This result is further evidenced by the increased expression of AhR-regulated metabolic enzymes, including CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 (Fig. 6c). Moreover, addition of the specific AhR antagonist CH-223191, which prevents AhR translocation (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Fig. 7A), abolished the enhanced TSG-6 production by KYNA (Fig. 6d). To determine whether AhR could directly bind to TSG-6 promoter, the TSG-6 promoter was scanned for putative binding site for AhR, revealing one candidate: GTGCTTGAGA (nucleotide \u20131609 to \u20131600; Supplementary Fig. 7B). However, no binding sites for AhR were evident in the promoters for KGF or Ang-1 (data not shown). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was employed to verify the interaction between AhR and the TSG-6 promoter. AhR was found to be able to bind the XRE region of the TSG-6 promoter, and addition of KYNA enhanced this binding capability (Fig. 6e). Collectively, these results suggest that KYNA indeed acts through its receptor AhR to directly regulate the expression of TSG-6.",

However, the molecular mechanisms that relay signals from metabolites in the tissue microenvironment to induce an appropriate gene expression response remain poorly understood. A better understanding of the mechanisms connecting metabolic intermediates to specific gene expression would have important ramifications for disease and development. In the present study, we demonstrate that IDO is critical in controlling TSG-6 expression in inflammatory cytokine-primed human MSCs as demonstrated in vivo in our ALI model and peritonitis model. Such regulation relies on the IDO-catalyzed metabolite, KYNA, rather than KYN, catalyzed by IDO. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that KYNA activates AhR to result in its nuclear translocation, thereby directly promoting TSG-6 expression by binding to its promoter (Fig. 6f).",

By catalyzing the first and rate-limiting step of tryptophan catabolism along the kynurenine pathway, IDO causes consumption of local tryptophan that is essential for proliferating cells, particularly immune cells [9]. Its immunoregulatory effect contributes to immune tolerance in many ways, including cell cycle arrest of proliferating T cells, long-term tolerance of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and affecting the process of antigen presentation [14,33\u201335]. On the other hand, by breaking down tryptophan, IDO generates several bioactive intermediates via the kynurenine pathway, including KYN, KYNA, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, and quinolinic acid [26]. Increasing evidence indicates that, in addition to the direct cytotoxicity by some of these tryptophan metabolites, they also have various impacts on the immune response [26, 36].",

Both molecules have been previously found to regulate immune responses. KYN has been reported to inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of type 1 helper T cells [10]. It also inhibits natural killer cells, and partially impairs their killing function [10]. In addition, KYN has also been demonstrated to promote the differentiation of Tregs and ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [11]. In contrast, although it shares the same receptor AhR [13], KYNA differs from KYN in several respects. KYNA has little cytotoxicity, and it may exert distinct impacts in different inflammatory context. In one study, KYNA was found to inhibit IL-10 expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages, and exacerbate atherosclerosis progression [31]. While other studies demonstrated that KYNA exerts an immunosuppressive function by modulating the expression of inflammation-associated genes, such as TNF, IL-6, and matrix metalloproteinases [13, 37, 38]. Given the immunosuppressive functions of KYN and KYNA, it is predictable that modulation of IDO and its downstream metabolites would affect the immunomodulatory role of human MSCs and be beneficial in the treatment of immune disorders.",

Considering that one important function of TSG-6 is to inhibit neutrophil migration [19, 20], we hypothesized that the mechanism underlying the effectiveness of MSCs in treating ALI was the inhibition of neutrophil extravasation to the lung. Actually, we did observe a decrease in CXCL1 and CXCL2 (data not shown), which are the murine homologs of the neutrophil chemokine, CXCL8, in lung extracts from ALI mice treated with human MSCs or recombinant human TSG-6 protein-treated ALI mice. This indicates that TSG-6 competitively binds to chemokine and inhibits their promotion of leukocyte migration. However, it has been difficult to verify TSG-6-mediated immunosuppression of neutrophils by human MSCs in vitro, because we found that cytokine-licensed human MSCs secrete, in addition to TSG-6, a large amount of CXCL8, which would dampen the inhibitory function of TSG-6 on neutrophil migration (data not shown). Therefore, whether the alleviating effect of TSG-6 on ALI results from its suppression of neutrophil migration remains to be determined.",

However, neither improved intensive clinical care, nor the anti-inflammatory drugs or pharmacologic therapies directed at improving lung functions have been effective in reducing mortality over the last several decades [41\u201349]. In this regard, MSCs have attracted much interest as a potential cell-based treatment for ALI, since preclinical studies have allowed the prospect of curing ALI with MSC therapy [50]. However, a currently clinical study of the effect of allogenic adipose-derived MSCs in ARDS showed only marginal effects, although no adverse side-effect occurred [51]. Therefore, a more effective MSC-based therapeutic strategy is still needed for the treatment of ALI and ARDS patients. Our findings that MSCs can be treated with KYNA to boost their production of TSG-6 and thus prevent neutrophil infiltration may provide a new potential strategy in the treatment of ALI and ARDS.",
