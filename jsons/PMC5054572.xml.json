After the introduction of intravenous immunoglobulin (Ig), the incidence of coronary artery lesions (CALs) decreased to fewer than 5% 3. Nonetheless, KD is the most common cause of acquired childhood heart disease in developed countries 4, 5. The incidence of KD is still increasing, according to the most recent nationwide survey (2013\u201314) in Japan 6.",

In the United States, the concordance rate of KD for monozygotic twins was 25% (one out of four) 9. For a single\u2010gene disorder with complete penetrance, the expected concordance rate should be 100% for monozygotic twins, while it should be lower for dizygotic twins. For conditions that are determined completely by environmental factors, the concordance rates for monozygotic and dizygotic twins should be essentially equal and depend upon the shared environment in which the twins live. Thus, these twin studies suggest that environmental factors contribute more to the development of KD than genetic factors among individuals with the same ethnicity.",

Although inositol 1,4,5\u2010trisphosphate 3\u2010kinase C (ITPKC) was described initially as a negative regulator of T cell activation 16, ITPKC is a ubiquitous molecule that is present in innate and acquired immune cells, as well as endothelial cells. ITPKC, caspase\u20103 (CASP3) and calcium release\u2010activated calcium channel protein 1 (ORAI1) may play important roles in KD development by regulating the calcium/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway 14, 15, 16. The candidate gene approach showed that KD is linked to genetic variations (TGFB2, TGFBR2 and SMAD3) in the transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u2010\u03b2) signalling pathway that are important in inflammation and vascular remodelling 17. VEGFA, KDR and ANGPT1 have also been reported to be associated with KD.

However, other research groups failed to detect such T cell expansion 31. Because only a small proportion of KD patients have shown V\u03b2\u2010restricted T cell activation 29, 30, 31, and there are no differences in KD symptoms or signs between patients with and without T cell activation (our unpublished observation), superantigen\u2010induced T cell activation may be an epiphenomenon rather than a necessity for the development of KD. Biofilms form as a result of interactions between microbes and the environment and are capable of producing large amounts of various bioactive molecules, including superantigens, through quorum\u2010sensing mechanisms 32. For example, when S. aureus was cultured in biofilms adhering to tampon sacs, the level of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) toxin\u20101 in these bacteria was more than 1000\u2010fold higher than that in bacteria cultured via conventional methods 33. Although TSS caused by TSS toxin\u20101 exhibits clinical features similar to those of KD 34, TSS is characterized by superantigen\u2010induced excessive T cell activation. In contrast, most cases of KD are characterized by T cell suppression, as well as endothelial cell/innate immune cell activation 35, 36. KD and TSS rarely develop in association with isolated sepsis or bacteraemia 37, in which bacteria grow under planktonic conditions. Thus, as is the case for TSS, the pathogenesis of KD may be evoked not by microbes themselves but by bioactive molecules that are produced by microbes under biofilm\u2010like conditions.",

Similar results were also obtained via oral administration of FK565, as shown in Fig. 1a 58.

The possible presence of PAMPs and DAMPs, such as S100 proteins and HMGB1, in KD patient sera 43, 44, 45, 46, 70 support the hypothesis that PAMPs/MAMPs, together with DAMPs, activate endothelial and immune cells co\u2010operatively through innate immune pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), as shown in Fig. 4. Recruitment of immune cells to activated endothelial cells and destruction of vascular structures lead to the development of KD vasculitis and aneurysms. These molecular scenarios may be even more prominent in genetically predisposed individuals. Although vasculitis can occur independently of T cell\u2010 and B cell\u2010mediated immunity, acquired immunity is undoubtedly associated with the vasculitides mediated by the innate immune system in humans. Regarding late KD vasculopathy 93 and the premature development of atherosclerosis in patients with a prior history of KD 94, further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these phenomena. They may result from persistent exposure to small amounts of vasculitis\u2010inducing molecules produced by endogenous microbes or from acquired immunity\u2010mediated vascular inflammation 95, 96.",
