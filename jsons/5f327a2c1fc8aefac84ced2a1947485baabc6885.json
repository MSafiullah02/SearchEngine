As in hospitals the diagnostic work-up often includes a CT thorax, this allows for a more exact determination of the typical infiltrate associated with bacterial LRTI as opposed to the typical glass ground opacities seen in COVID-19. This extra diagnostic (CT scan for conventional pneumonia patients is not common) should empower physician to withhold empirical antibiotics in patients with characteristic images for COVID-19 on CT .

[11] Other causes of respiratory worsening should be ruled out, such as cardiogenic failure (myocarditis is common), pulmonary embolism (thrombotic events are commonly reported) or fluid overload (11) Finally, it should be kept in mind that even during the COVID pandemic patients will present with other infections such as urinary tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, intraabdominal infections etc. which should be considered in the differential diagnosis (especially in the elderly) and be managed according to CLM-20-17325 established guidelines.

            "text": "Antibiotic treatment duration should not exceed 5 days in most cases as generally recommended in most guidelines for community acquired pneumonia.[9] (6) If antibiotics are considered a beta-lactam providing coverage for S. pneumoniae +/methicillin-susceptible S. aureus should be the first option (e.g. amoxicillin + clavulanic acid or 3 rd generation cephalosporins). Once-a-day administration (where applicable) or continuous administration of beta-lactam antibiotics should be considered to decrease the use of personal protective equipment which may be in short supply in many places. Macrolides and quinolones should be avoided because of their cardiac side effects (considering that other agents associated with cardiac side effects such as (hydroxy)chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir are used in manyplaces notwithstanding the limited evidence for their efficacy) and impact on antimicrobial resistance. If atypical coverage is considered necessary (e.g. COVID-19 not yet confirmed and suspicion of Legionella infection) consideration should be given to doxycycline. Routine atypical coverage does, however, not seem warranted given the low a priori probability of superinfection with atypical pathogens.[10] patients in intensive care units requiring mechanical ventilation standard measures to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other healthcare associated infections should be applied. Empiric treatment of VAP in these patients should be based on local and individual patient-level resistance data and treatment should be adapted according to microbiologic results (ideally from the lower respiratory tract). (8) Anecdotal data about the impact of azithromycin on SARS-CoV-2 viral load does not justify the routine administration of this antibiotic before confirmatory trials are completed. (9) Antibiotics should not be given \"prophylactically\" to prevent bacterial pneumonia (use of selective digestive decontamination [SDD] may be an exception in intensive care units where this is established practice).",
