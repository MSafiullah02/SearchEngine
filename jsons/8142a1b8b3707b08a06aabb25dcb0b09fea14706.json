Basel has urban quarters that differ substantially in 76 socioeconomic indicators and housing structure. By using information at the level of statistical 77 blocks, we were able to construct a detailed picture of influenza transmission within the city. We 78 visualized kernel density estimates of influenza cases (reflecting the clustering of cases), a 79 fundamental data smoothing method where inferences about the population are made, together 80 with various population-based factors on maps with high resolution. Cases were corrected for 81 population density and socioeconomic factors such as education levels, income and available 82 living space were then analysed. Furthermore, we complemented the data with a detailed 83 personal survey distributed to 30,000 households during the 2015/2016 flu season, to further 84 explore urban quarter-specific aspects of self-reported influenza-like illness and association to 85 socioeconomic factors. Finally, we described the details of influenza transmission during the 86 2016/2017 season using whole genome sequencing of all collected influenza viruses, covering 87 5 more than 650 isolates, combining the data, resulting in an unprecedented spatiotemporal 88 resolution. The details on the study design for this project have previously been published 20 . 89 90 Results: 91 Reoccurring influenza patterns within a city 92 The City of Basel has 19 urban quarters and a stable mean population of 175,350 inhabitants 93 during the 5-year study period (+/-1,737 inhabitants) (Figure S1A). A total of 1,078 statistical 94 blocks were identified within the city for the subsequent analysis. First, we collected epidemiologic 95 and geographic information of 1,715 PCR-confirmed influenza cases over five consecutive 96 influenza seasons from 2013/2014 to 2017/2018 and identified areas with a high burden of 97 influenza infections (Figure S1B-C). Influenza viruses isolated in Switzerland were similar to 98 viruses isolated across Europe in the study period (Table S1). On a weekly basis, we linked each 99 individual case of PCR-confirmed influenza to the patient's place of residence and anonymized 100 the data at the scale of statistical blocks. We determined both the kernel density estimates for 101 absolute influenza cases across all urban quarters and observed regional clusters of influenza 102 cases within the city across all five seasons (Figure 1A) with similar spatial patterns for each 103 individual season (Figure S1D-H).",

We linked socioeconomic scores to each statistical block 106 reflecting (i) the population density (inhabitants per hectare (ha)), (ii) the living space (per capita 107 in m 2 ), and (iii) the net income (median in CHF). Each of these three key factors was translated 108 to \"socioeconomic points\" ranging from one to five, which were added to generate a total 109 socioeconomic score for each housing block: a score of three reflecting the lowest and a score of 110 fifteen the highest possible socioeconomic value 20 (Figure S2A-D) . The median socioeconomic 111 scores of urban quarters ranged from three to ten. We observed that city areas with a high 112 socioeconomic score had fewer influenza cases in comparison to areas with lower socioeconomic 113 scores ( Figure 1B) . Figure 1C provides a representative example of the effect of population 114 density during the 2016/2017 influenza season comparing the urban quarters Gundeldingen (GU, 115 high population density with high influenza burden) with Bruderholz (BR, low population density 116 with low influenza burden). These two urban quarters are located next to each other but are 117 notably different. The urban quarter with small detached residential buildings (single family 118 homes) showed a mean socioeconomic score of 9.5 (+/-1.71 standard deviation) while the other 119 urban quarter with large (multifamily) residential buildings shows a mean socioeconomic score of 126 the level of statistical blocks across urban quarters during the examined influenza seasons 127 (Figure 1E-F, S3A-H, Supplementary file 1). Besides visualizations of influenza case 128 distributions, we further explored associations between socioeconomic factors and the influenza 129 incidence (corrected for the population density within each statistical block). The analysis included 130 all five seasons and data from all 1,484 statistical blocks for every year. We used a multivariable 131 Poisson regression and observed that net income of the statistical block (per 1,000 CHF) was the 132 strongest predictor for influenza incidence at the level of statistical blocks, independent of 133 population density and living space in most influenza seasons (Figure 1G, S4). 134 135 Socioeconomic factors determinate herd immunity 136 To further explore the interrelationship between socioeconomic factors and rates of influenza-like 137 illness, we conducted a detailed survey across ten urban quarters for the 2015/2016 season 138 (Figure S1A). The survey included 54 questions, addressing (i) influenza-like illness and 139 vaccination, (ii) aspects of the urban environment, (iii) access to health care information, (iv) 140 health related data, and (v) the place of residence at the level of statistical enumeration blocks.",

We combined the Basel sequences with a global726 sample of sequences (downloaded on 17th July 2018) from https://www.gisaid.org which had 727 been sampled between 1st January 2016 and 31st December 2017 for which at least the 728 segments HA, NA and MP were available. We then calculated the average nucleotide difference 729 between any of the sequences and the sequences from Basel. To split the dataset into 730 manageable pieces, we first grouped any two sequences from Basel together if they were within 731 an average nucleotide difference of 0.0025 per position. When the full genome for two sequences 732 was available, this would correspond to about 32 different positions on the full genome. For an 733 average clock rate of 0.005 mutations per site per year, 32 differences correspond to a pairwise 734 phylogenetic distance of about 0.5 years. Sets of sequences from Basel were only split into two 735 groups if the two closest related sequences of each group exceeded this criterium. Based on this 736 initial grouping, we added global sequences to each cluster if they were at maximum 0.0025/2 737 mutations away from any of the sequences from Basel. Factor 2 was used to reduce the number 738 of global sequences in each of these initial clusters.739 740Phylogenetic trees of initial clusters. We next estimated rates of evolution for each segment using 741 the SRD06 model 60 and a strict clock model, from 200 full genome sequences sampled in 742 California, New York and Europe between 2010 and 2015, using Beast 2.5 61 . Apart from this, 743 these sequences were not otherwise used in the analysis, and as such are an independent 744 dataset. We allowed each segment to have its own phylogeny in order to avoid the possibility of 745 a reassortment biasing the estimates of evolutionary rates. Each of the segments, as well as the 746 first two and third codon position was allowed to have its own rate scaler. We ran ten independent 747 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains each for 10 8 iterations and then combined them after 748 a burn-in of 10%. These estimated evolutionary rates are long-term rates of influenza A/H3N2.",

Since the influenza season covers only a few months, we 765 additionally assumed that lineages are unlikely to persist in Basel for more than 5 weeks (0.1 766 years) without being sampled. To reflect this assumption, we classified internal nodes that are 767 more than 0.1 years from a sample from Basel to be either outside of Basel, or to be in an unknown768 location. We then defined sequences to be in the same local cluster if all their ancestors are 769 inferred to be in Basel. Local clusters are obtained for each iteration of the MCMC.

In particular, 37.9% of males replied to the survey, whereas in diagnostic using PCR confirmation, we cannot exclude some recruitment bias, that particular people with a specific demographic background are more likely to be included at a tertiary 312 healthcare centre. In order to compensate for such a bias, we also included data from other study influenza will not seek healthcare. Thus, some transmission links will always remain unknown.For more detailed analyses, future studies would need to include hundreds of samples with high resolution epidemiological data across multiple influenza seasons to study the changing patterns of transmission over multiple years. In addition, the transmission events across urban quarters 12 are highly complex, driven by mobility of people living within a city and commuters, place of working, and changing antibody titres of exposed patients in each year. Although we have asked where a person works, we were not able to collect sufficient data for this question -only 24.6% provided details and people working in the same statistical block were very rare (<5%).knowledge gained with our study can help to tailor public health measures such as urban 337 vaccination programs to urban influenza hotspots and not just to selected target groups (e.g. highrisk populations with chronic illness).
