However, the incursion of equine influenza into Australia in 2007 (Kirkland et al., 2011) highlighted that geographic isolation, trade restrictions and biosecurity do not guarantee protection from exotic disease incursions. Following the equine influenza incursion and the recommendations of the report \u201cOne health: a working partnership\u201d (Beale et al., 2008), a project was initiated to investigate and prioritise exotic disease risks to the pig industry. The overall aim of the project is to enhance the industry's preparedness and response to an incursion of the highest priority diseases in order to minimise impact on trade.",

These include rapid risk analysis (McKenzie et al., 2007), qualitative decision trees (Palmer et al., 2005), consensus techniques (Weinberg et al., 1999) and semi-quantitative scoring techniques based on levels of severity of disease criteria that may or may not be weighted to contribute to disease importance (Carter, 1992, Rushdy and O\u2019Mahony, 1998, Valenciano and Working Grp, 2001, Doherty, 2006, Krause and Prioritization Working Grp, 2008, Balabanova et al., 2011). All of these methods take into account the complex decision problem that is disease prioritisation; there is more than one criterion by which to rank the importance of a disease. However, the transparency of these prioritisations is affected by subjectivity when scoring diseases; particularly when using qualitative criteria that have been assigned arbitrary numerical levels of severity which are difficult to define.",

To achieve this aim we used MCDA, applying a modified multi-attribute value theory (MAVT) based multi-attribute decision making (MADM) technique which used several approaches not widely used in previously in disease prioritisation. These novel approaches included using a set of quantifiable disease attributes as indicators of disease impact, deriving and validating weights of importance from a stakeholder group (pig producers) not considered to be experts in diseases via an online survey (Brookes et al., in preparation), and presenting the results as series of prioritisation lists that build up impacts to aid communication with stakeholders. We evaluated this technique in the context of disease prioritisation in the Australian pig industry.",

MADM methods are designed to rank or group the best alternatives from a set of discrete choices by following a standard series of steps (Fig. 1\n), and can be used in disease prioritisation because there is choice over discrete alternatives (diseases or disease control methods). MADM methods can again be subdivided into elementary methods (pros and cons analysis, maximax and maximin methods, conjunctive and disjunctive methods, lexicographic methods), multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) or multi-attribute value theory (MAVT) based methods, and outranking methods.",

The stakeholders were defined as pig producers in Australia. Diseases exotic to the pig industry in Australia were identified as the decision alternatives and criteria describing disease impacts were selected. Impacts included the potential effects of disease on the pig industry (described by on-farm effects of attack rate, length of clinical disease and case fatality rate in pigs, and industry wide effects of market loss and government cost sharing in the case of a disease incursion), the ruminant industry (described by market loss to this industry), and human health (described by incidence, disability weight and case fatality rate in humans). Diseases alternatives were evaluated according to the criteria and stakeholder preference modelling was used to elicit weights of importance for the criteria (Brookes et al., in preparation). The decision matrix combining this information is shown in Fig. 2\n. The components were aggregated according to an additive value function based on multi-attribute value theory to produce a score range for each disease. The diseases were ordered according to the mean score to create prioritisation lists, and sensitivity of the scores to the criterion measurements was assessed. The lists were used as a decision aid to select diseases for further investigation of biosecurity requirements using risk analysis and disease spread modelling.",

When market losses and cost sharing agreements were considered, and pig farm impacts were altered to reflect the instigation of control policies such as on-farm slaughter, swine vesicular disease and vesicular stomatitis (if undifferentiated from FMD) had highest priority to this group of stakeholders (Fig. 4). The priority of swine vesicular disease relative to FMD was increased further when potential zoonotic effects were added (Fig. 5). When differentiated from FMD, the priority of both swine vesicular disease and vesicular stomatitis reduced relative to FMD; this was the case regardless of the potential zoonotic impact of swine vesicular disease (Fig. 5). African swine fever and classical swine fever (acute form) were prioritised after the vesicular diseases, followed by the highly pathogenic form of porcine reproductive and respiratory disease (China 06-07 strain). Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome was also included in a less severe form and appeared as a much lower priority in all three livestock prioritisation lists. The weights of importance indicated that the zoonotic effects of diseases were not as important as the livestock and trade effects to this group of stakeholders (Brookes et al., in preparation) and this is reflected in the aggregated results for this group; diseases such as Nipah virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and rabies were not a high priority even once the zoonotic effects were added in the full impacts list.",

This was advantageous in that scoring was straightforward (data was readily available for most diseases) and more importantly, the scores were objective, definitive measures and therefore transparent and reproducible. Previous prioritisation exercises have used levels of criteria to score diseases, either to allow use of categorical criteria such as potential threat, emerging potential and disease trend, or to reduce quantitative criteria to commensurable scales. In the case of categorical criteria, the decision-makers define an ordinal scale according to level of severity of the criterion. The levels are subjective and definitions can be open to interpretation, thus affecting both transparency and reproducibility. Disease prioritisations that have been repeated have addressed this problem by modifying and improving definition of criteria (Carter, 1992, Doherty, 2006) or seeking stakeholder input in designing future prioritisations (Krause and Prioritization Working Grp, 2008, Gilsdorf and Krause, 2011). For both qualitative and quantitative criteria, using levels also inadvertently weights the criteria because the cut-offs between levels are arbitrary. For example, the study designers could choose to divide a criterion range (for example 0\u2013100) into either 4 or 5 levels of equal size, giving the value 95 a score of 4 in one scheme, and 5 in the other. The study designers have therefore inadvertently added weight to some of the values in one scoring system compared to the other. As well as adding a subjective element that again reduces transparency and reproducibility, this could affect the order of ranking by influencing the overall disease score. In this study it was not necessary to reduce the criteria to commensurable scales. The MAVT based technique used here was modified to allow use of incommensurable scales, because the values elicited in the stakeholder preference modelling step were modelled within the MAVT function and are therefore implicitly related to the scales of criteria (Brookes et al., in preparation).",

Multiple disease scenarios were tested without having to repeatedly consult stakeholders, as also demonstrated in other recent prioritisations (Havelaar et al., 2010, Humblet et al., 2012, Ng and Sargeant, 2012, Del Rio Vilas et al., 2013). In addition, this prioritisation demonstrated how the weights of importance from more than one stakeholder group could be aggregated to produce prioritisation lists tailored to the values of different stakeholder groups without having to collect further disease information. This has wider implications than simply informing resource allocation for this stakeholder group. \u201cPublic perception\u201d is often included as a criterion in disease prioritisations because it is recognised as an important driver of human and animal health policy. It comprises judgement of the impacts of a disease, including the mitigations, in a social and cultural context and therefore, defining and measuring public perception is a challenge. Its definitions and levels have varied between prioritisations reflecting this difficulty (Carter, 1992, Rushdy and O\u2019Mahony, 1998, Doherty, 2000, Del Rio Vilas et al., 2013). Prioritisations such as this can provide a model of public perception by using broad groups of stakeholders such as the general public to inform criterion weights, or smaller groups such as farmers and animal welfare organisations. This can be used to assist policy makers in understanding how people who are not health-experts value disease attributes and perceive the overall importance of different diseases.",

Vesicular diseases dominated the three prioritisation lists for the stakeholders who placed most importance on livestock and industry impacts of diseases. Building up the prioritisation in stages was an important communication tool because it allowed stakeholders to visualise how disease scores changed as different types of impacts were added. The highest weighted criteria for this group were attack rate and length of clinical disease in pigs (Brookes et al., in preparation). Therefore, foot and mouth disease (FMD) scored the highest in the first prioritisation list that considered pig farm criteria only, above acute forms of African swine fever and classical swine fever which had comparable attack rates in pigs, much higher case fatality rates but much lower lengths of clinical disease. Once the criteria for market loss for pigs and ruminants and the amount of cost sharing by the government were added to the next list, several scenarios for some diseases were included in order to account for variation and uncertainty regarding disease measurements. When swine vesicular disease (SVD) and vesicular stomatitis (VS) were included as scenarios that were undifferentiated from FMD they ranked in first and second places respectively, due to lower cost-sharing by the government compared to FMD. Their priority diminished once differentiated from FMD, and again if modified stamping out was used rather than stamping out that does not allow process slaughtering. This showed that rapid differentiation from FMD and early detection of incursions of SVD and VS are both important factors in reducing the impact for this stakeholder group.",

The China 06-07 strain, otherwise known as highly pathogenic PRRS, occurred as a severe outbreak of disease across China starting in 2006 (Tong et al., 2007). However, the pigs in China were co-infected with other pathogens (Zhou and Yang, 2010), making the severity of disease due to PRRS alone difficult to evaluate. Given the relentless spread of the highly pathogenic PRRS syndrome through south-eastern Asia and Australia's proximity to these outbreaks (An et al., 2011), this form was included in this study. It appeared high on the prioritisation list. The other form of PRRS included might be more typical of outbreaks in developed countries, such as the outbreak identified in Sweden in 2007 (Carlsson et al., 2009) which was detected by routine sero-surveillance and subsequently eradicated. This form of PRRS appeared much lower down the prioritisation list than highly pathogenic PRRS. The final list for this group of stakeholders included the criteria concerning the zoonotic effects of disease on human health. Overall, the disease order did not change markedly except for diseases with high disability weight such as rabies which increased in priority, as disability weight was the fourth highest weighted criterion for this group. We did not consider FMD as a zoonosis in this prioritisation because its transmission to humans is rare and accepted as causing very mild clinical signs (Prempeh et al., 2001). SVD is generally not considered to be a zoonosis at all. However, it was reported to cause disease in four laboratory workers and one person was hospitalised (Brown et al., 1976, Lin and Kitching, 2000). This potential level of severity of disease makes its zoonotic effects difficult to ignore, even if rare. However, if zoonotic transmission of the virus is not an important factor SVD also reduces in priority once differentiated from FMD.",

Consequently, zoonotic diseases scored much higher than in the livestock disease prioritisation lists. This stakeholder group was inconsistent in their preference rankings in the step to elicit criterion weights (Brookes et al., in preparation). It was recommended that these lists should be used to prioritise zoonotic diseases only, particularly as attack rate in pigs \u2013 their lowest weighted criterion \u2013 had a negative mean weight leading to unexpected final scores for diseases with high attack rate in pigs, but low criterion measurements otherwise. When zoonotic criteria were considered alone, rabies, Japanese encephalitis, Eastern equine encephalitis and Nipah virus were the highest priority diseases. These results are consistent with a recent prioritisation of zoonotic diseases using conjoint analysis of the preferences of a public stakeholder group in North America (Ng and Sargeant, 2012), and a prioritisation of zoonotic disease using MCDA and the values of disease experts (Havelaar et al., 2010). When all criteria and diseases are included rabies is still the highest priority disease, followed by SVD as a zoonosis and Japanese encephalitis. FMD and SVD undifferentiated from FMD are still high priority due to their high case fatality rates when stamping out is used to control disease on farms.",

We considered the stakeholders to be experts in pig farming, and therefore able to interpret disease information in terms of economic impact on their farms and to their industry. More detailed economic analysis could be carried out subsequently on selected diseases. Control methods such as treatment or vaccination are either preventive or instigated secondary to a disease incursion, and can also be considered subsequently. Ultimately, MCDA in disease prioritisation is an aid to decision-making, not a substitute for making decisions. It provides a baseline of information about disease impacts according to stakeholder opinion. Selection of diseases for resource allocation for either surveillance and prevention or control will be influenced by other factors such as risk of disease entry (Cox, 2009), once the diseases have been ordered.",

Another limitation of this prioritisation is exclusion of diseases due to insufficient information. It is possible that they could be of high priority if they could be included. A procedure involving the use of algorithms such as those described and used by the Human Animal Infections Risks and Surveillance Group (Palmer et al., 2005, Morgan et al., 2009), could be modified and used to assess information gaps and potential threats from these diseases.",

Whilst MCDA has been used in previous disease prioritisations, this is the first prioritisation of diseases of livestock using MCDA that reflects the values of a specific group of public stakeholders who are not considered disease experts. Although the aim of decision making is to usually combine the opinions of all stakeholders, producing two sets of prioritisation lists at the aggregation step of this MCDA allowed better representation of the values of the stakeholder group rather than producing an \u201caverage\u201d list that suited nobody. Overall, quantitative criterion measurements through the use of MAVT and separation of objective criterion measurements from subjective weights of importance through the MADM structure provided transparency, reproducibility and flexibility to the prioritisation, and provided stakeholders with a decision-aid based on their own values. It subsequently allowed the stakeholders to make an informed decision about which diseases should be prioritised for further investigation of biosecurity requirements using risk analysis and disease spread modelling.",
