A subset of 55 samples were genotyped for the FUT2 G428A polymorphism and the antibody titers compared. The same subset of samples was also analysed by ELISA using whole rotavirus Wa particles (G1P[8]) as antigen. Ninety-three per cent of the samples were positive for at least one of the VP8* antigens. Differences in the IgG seroprevalence were found between children and adults for the P[4], P[8] and P[11] genotypes. Similarly, significant differences were found between adults and children in their antibody titers against the P[4], P[8], and P[11] VP8* genotypes, having the children higher antibody titers than adults. Interestingly, positive samples against rare genotypes such as P[11] (only in children), P[14] and P[25] were found. While no statistical differences in the antibody titers between secretors and non-secretors were found for any of the tested P genotypes studied, a higher statistic significant prevalence for the P[25] genotype was found in secretors compared to non-secretors. Significant differences in the antibody titers between secretors and non-secretors were found when the whole viral particles from the Wa rotavirus strain (G1P[8]) were used as the antigen.",

VP7 is a glycoprotein that determines the G-type antigen while VP4 is a protease-sensitive protein that determines the P-type antigen 2 . The common rotavirus classification involves their genome composition and their serological reactivity, so the scientific community uses the VP7, VP4 and VP6 proteins to classify them. Rotaviruses are classified into 7 groups (A to G) based in the immunological reactivity of the VP6 (middle layer viral protein). Rotaviruses from the groups A to C have been isolated from humans but the most prevalent is the group A.",

VP8* is mainly involved in the virus -cell attachment process, while VP5* is involved in the translocation of the virus into the cytoplasm of host cells. For more than 30 years sialic acid was considered the glycoside receptor for animal rotaviruses 4 . Interestingly, human strains were considered sialic acid independent. The discovery that the VP8* from human rotavirus strains also interacts with sugars, components of the histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), broke the paradigm of the understanding of rotavirus biology, showing that the first steps of infection of human rotaviruses are mediated by specific carbohydrate-virus interactions 5, 6 . HBGAs synthesis occurs by a sequential addition of monosaccharides to a disaccharide precursor. The precursor contains the sugars galactose and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) linked by a \u03b2-1,3 or \u03b2-1,4 linkage. Depending on the linkage the sugars are classified as type I containing \u03b2-1,3 linkage whereas type II includes \u03b2-1,4 linkage. To synthesize the H antigen is needed the addition of a fucose in the \u03b1-1,2 position by the enzyme FUT2. Lewis antigens are synthesised by the addition of a fucose residue in the position \u03b1-1,4 or \u03b1-1,3 to the terminal GlcNAc or H type I and II precursors respectively to create the different Lewis a, b, x and y antigens 7 . The secretor status is defined by the FUT2 gene, non-secretor individuals are those that lack functionality in both FUT-2 alleles and subsequently do not express H-antigen structures (Fig. 1) .",

These genotypes are responsible for almost 90% of the rotavirus infections globally 15 and also in our study area 11 . In two recent publications addressing the molecular epidemiology of human rotavirus in Valencia (Spain), it was shown that 98.5% of the samples were from the P [8] genotype and only 1.5% belonged to the P[4] genotype 11, 17 . None of the other genotypes assayed on the present study were found in clinical samples (P [6] , P [9] , P [11] , P [14] , P [25] ). Accordingly, the results of the present study show a higher prevalence and titers to the P [8] and P [4] genotypes. Interestingly, the P [11] genotype was only recognised by the serum samples from children, reinforcing the evidence that P [11] genotype has a higher age restriction than other genotypes, probably due to the ability of this genotype to recognize non fucosylated receptors 18 .",

Interestingly, when the whole rotavirus Wa particle was used, significant higher titers against rotavirus was found in secretors, compared to non-secretors. These data confirm a previous report of higher anti-rotavirus titers in secretor individuals in Sweden 23 . It is important to mention that structural and non-structural proteins such as VP2,VP6 and NSP2 are immunodominant 24 , while VP8* is poorly recognised by serum antibodies 25 . These differences in immunodominance might explain why the differences between secretors and non-secretors can only be observed when the whole viral particle containing VP2 and VP6 (plus VP4 and Table 2 .

These results are highly relevant, in the context of vaccine development, since a VP8* subunit vaccine is under development 26 . Common vaccines such as Rotarix (G1P [8] ) and RotaTeq (G1-G4 P [8] ) are protective against a broad range of rotavirus G and P genotypes, even against those not included in the vaccines 27 . This might be due to the cross immunity raised to the immunodominant VP6 and VP2 proteins that are more conserved in group A rotaviruses, independently of the G and P genotypes 2 . This might explain, as well, the level of protection achieved with the Rotavac vaccine which is composed of a G9P [11] genotype 28 . In regard to the VP8* subunit vaccine, it has been demonstrated that the VP8* protein can elicit neutralising and protective antibodies [29] [30] [31] . However it has also been demonstrated that the protection is homotypic 31 , indicating that this vaccine might only protect against the rotavirus carrying the genotypes included in the formulation. On the other hand, one of the advantages of the VP8* subunit vaccine is that it is administered by the parenteral route, shortcutting the differences in the vaccine uptake observed between secretors and non-secretors 26 .

The H panel shows the results using the whole rotavirus particle from the Wa strain, a P [8] strain. The error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM). The samples did not show any significant differences between these two populations for the VP8* proteins (P > 0.05).

Furthermore, when the VP8* binding pocket was compared between different genotypes and lineages it was found that the VP8* from the Rotarix vaccine possesses a mutation (L167F) that disrupts the binding pocket providing an explanation for the attenuation of this strain 5 . More surprisingly, we found significative differences in the prevalence of antibodies against the P [25] genotype in secretors and non-secretors. This genotype is known to bind to the blood group A antigen 5 . The presence of the A group antigen depends on the A enzyme coded in the ABO locus. The A enzyme utilizes the H antigen as substrate, this means that secretor negative individuals are unable to synthesize the A blood group antigen in their mucosae, giving an explanation to the lower susceptibility of non-secretors to a virus that binds to the A antigen instead of the H antigen.",
