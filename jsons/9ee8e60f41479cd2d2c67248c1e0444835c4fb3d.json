We report the experience in our transplant centre, in the midst of the current outbreak in Lombardy, Italy (10 million inhabitants; 25 124 ascertained infections, and 7199 virus-related deaths as of March 31, 2020). 2 Three of our 111 long-term liver transplant survivors (transplanted more than 10 years ago) have died in the past 3 weeks (between March 5 and March 18) following severe COVID-19 disease. All three were male, older than 65 years, receiving antihypertensive drugs, overweight (BMI >28 kg/m2), with hyperlipidaemia, and diabetes (median HbA 1c of 6\u20229%). The post-transplant course had been uneventful for all three patients, and their immunosuppressive regimen had been gradually tapered off, with very low trough concentrations of calcineurin inhibitors (two patients receiving ciclosporin [28 and 35 ng/mL, respectively] and one receiving tacrolimus [2\u20221 ng/mL]). All three patients died after admission to hospital for community-acquired pneumonia, and were in need of supplementary oxygen at admission but rapidly developed severe respiratory distress syndrome that required mechanical ventilation. The patients died between 3 and 12 days after the onset of pneumonia; all three patients had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swabs. By contrast, three of our 40 recently transplanted (ie, within the past 2 years) patients have tested SARS-CoV-2 positive, and although quarantined, are all experiencing an uneventful course of disease.",

            "text": "Available data regarding COVID-19 suggest that tissue damage might be mediated by a direct virus-induced cytopathogenic effect or could be due to an immunomediated inflammatory response to the virus. 3 Whether liver transplant recipients are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection is a matter of concern, but so far there have been no specific recommendations from major societies. A case series from Italy showed that children who had received liver transplants, despite being immunosuppressed, were not at increased risk of severe pulmonary disease compared with the general population. 4 All three COVID-19-related deaths observed in our centre were long-term patients on minimal immunosuppressive regimens, rather than recently transplanted, fully immunosuppressed patients. We examined clinical and demographic data of our patients (table). In keeping with the paediatric data, 4 immunosuppression did not seem to increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease. Given that a reactive innate immune response might be responsible for severe clinical manifestations, immunosuppression might be protective, although this needs further clarification. Conversely, the presence of metabolic-related comorbidities, which are known to increase with time since transplant, 5 might be associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease. However, the number of COVID-19related deaths in our series is small, and these observations can only be considered preliminary.",

            "text": "Post-transplant metabolic complications (eg, arterial hyper tension, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, and weight gain) might outweigh immuno suppression as a risk factor for development of severe COVID-19 disease in patients who have received liver transplants, in line with data from China, which suggest that comorbidities are associated with a worse prognosis. 6 Of these metabolic complications, diabetes might be of particular concern, given its high prevalence (20-40%) in patients undergoing solid organ transplantation. 7 Notably, a comparison of the 3% COVID-19-associated mortality observed in our long-term transplant recipients with the 10% casefatality rate noted in Italy at present is difficult, since the case-fatality rate is known to be biased because nasopharyngeal swabbing is only done in highly symptomatic patients. 8 This limitation also applies to our population of liver transplant recipients-the total number who could be SARS-CoV-2 positive (but who remain asymptomatic or who have only mild symptoms, and who have thus not been tested), is not known. Nonetheless, given the short observation period (3 weeks) which we report here, the observed death rate is of concern. We recognise the intrinsic limitations of this case series (ie, the small sample size, the unavailability of the exact number of COVID-19 positive patients, and the associated difficulty in accurately calculating the case-fatality rate) and the consequent urgent need of collecting data for further studies to draw more solid conclusions. However, according to this initial observation, we suggest that great attention is paid to",
