Human coronaviruses cause respiratory infections that range in seriousness from common colds to severe acute respiratory syndrome. Like influenza, coronaviruses can be neurotropic. To test for associations between coronaviruses and serious mental disorders, we utilized a recently developed assay and measured immunoglobulin G (IgG) response against 4 human coronavirus strains (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43) in 106 patients with a recent onset of psychotic symptoms and 196 nonpsychiatric controls. We expressed results quantitatively as antibody levels and qualitatively as seroprevalence relative to a defined seropositivity cutoff value. Patient IgG levels were higher than controls for HKU1, NL63, and OC43, with HKU1 and NL63 both showing highly significant patient-to-control differences (HKU1, P \u00a3 .002; NL63, P \u00a3 .00001). All 4 coronaviruses were more seroprevalent in patients vs controls, with greatest intergroup differences observed for HKU1 (93% vs 77%, P \u00a3 .0001). HKU1 and NL63 associations with the patient group were further supported by multivariate analyses that controlled for age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, and smoking status (HKU1, odds ratio [OR] 5 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5 1.03-1.67, P \u00a3 .027; NL63, OR 5 2.42, 95% CI 5 1.25-4.66, P \u00a3 .008).

Schizoaffective disorder, which has a mood disorder It is also possible that diagnostic uncertainty present close to the start of an illness with psychotic symptoms may have led to some misclassifications. For example, differentiating bipolar disorder with psychotic features from schizoaffective disorder may not always be 100% accurate. Within-group distributions also may have influenced study outcome in the mood disorder subgrouping where 30.2% (n = 16) of the patients suffered from major depression and the remainder from subtypes of bipolar disorder. Other limitations should also be considered when interpreting the results presented here, including study design and control group representativeness. For each serum sample, the antibodies measured represent an immunological profile based on a single time point, and therefore, data can only be analyzed in a cross sectional manner. Future studies that incorporate a prospective design will allow the assessment of changes in antibody levels over time and will enable us to ascertain the utility of this antibody measure as a diagnostic tool and/or etiological agent. Another potentially limiting factor may be that the inclusion/exclusion criteria for our control group led to a sample that may not be fully representative of persons in the general population. The net effect of our recruitment of volunteers who were excluded from having Axis 1 disorders, viral infections, or antiviral therapy may in fact be a control group that was unusually healthy. An ideal control group would be composed of individuals with nonpsychotic learning or developmental disorders who live similar lifestyles as those who go on to develop mental disorders with psychotic symptoms. With respect to the exclusion of current viral infections and antiviral medications in the control but not in the patient group, any virus showing coinfection with the coronaviruses could potentially bias the results in favor of a spurious association. Of note, we performed a similar evaluation of the influenza A and B viruses in these populations, and differences in antibody levels between patients and controls were not detected (data not shown), thus providing some evidence against an intergroup unequal exposure rate hypothesis, at least for respiratory viruses. In the future, additional control groups should be evaluated to determine the prevalence of coronavirus infections in a wide range of human populations.
