Targeted channels of communication through text and instant messaging also have been adopted.

From distributing more than 3000 of 5000 processed donor corneas annually, the Veneto Eye Bank has seen a 95% reduction in demand from its network of 250 local and international surgeons. Considering that the culture of donation is based on social awareness and altruism, eye banking services cannot be slowed down correspondingly to 5% because it would be impossible to resume regular procurement rates quickly to match a renewed demand for corneal tissue after the lockdown. As a compromise, the eye bank has reduced procurement temporarily to 60% of normal rates.",

Cryopreservation has been used previously, but is cumbersome and results in relatively poor graft quality.4 Instead, tissue dehydration and lyophilization, albeit not suitable for endothelium preservation, has been used successfully in the past for preservation and international distribution of epikeratophakia lenticules.5 The Veneto Eye Bank has validated the preservation time of dehydrated corneas (6 months) and currently is storing these dehydrated corneas for research and training purposes, as well as for possible use in deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty. Because deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty is performed in Europe in high numbers (40% of total keratoplasties at our institution), corneas procured during this outbreak could be preserved for periods long enough to avoid wastage of unused corneas, while allowing ongoing donation and procurement at levels compatible with quick resumption of normal surgical activities. The long-term impact is that this experience underscores the need to develop alternative preservation techniques to improve resilience in the face of inevitable future infectious threats.",
