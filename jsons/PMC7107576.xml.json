Importantly, the points of origin of such health hazards may be thousands of kilometres away from unsuspecting hosts. For instance, a hazardous corollary of global trade is that pathogens of all sorts hitch rides on cargoes, along food chains and on arthropods, animals and humans as vectors to spread disease. The 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic have been widely recognized as defining milestones in global health protection. These directly transmissible respiratory pathogens were the first in this century to have caused unprecedented havoc, in terms of its toll on human health, the economy and politics writ large. In the case of SARS, a series of inter-species jumps of the virus from civets and/or bats in southern China, carried by a super-spreader to the amplification hub of Hong Kong as an international logistics and travel centre, quickly led to an epidemic of global proportions.1,2 A similar story applies for the most recent influenza pandemic.3 The strain of Vibrio cholera that caused Haiti's epidemic in 2010, having infected half-a-million and killed more than 6000, originated from India and Cameroon.4 Egyptian fenugreek seeds that grew into sprouts contaminated by E coli O104:H4 apparently led to almost 4000 cases and 50 deaths in northern Germany.5",
