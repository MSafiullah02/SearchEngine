Therefore, all the patients with malignant diseases should be registered in the database after a definite diagnosis, so that the diagnosis of the patient registered in the HIRA database would be relatively correct. Using this open claims data, we used selected diagnostic codes to extract the data of patients with pediatric malignant diseases. The source population comprised all patients under 21 years of age who had been diagnosed with cancer, aplastic anemia (AA) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), as defined by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD, 10th revision), between September 2009 and December 2013 (Table 1\n).

During each year of the study period, more than 1000 respiratory specimens were collected from about 100 participating hospitals across the country, and the causative pathogens were identified using standardized diagnostic procedures in a central laboratory. In addition, the prevalence of enteric pathogens was under weekly surveillance, with cohorts comprising 17 local environmental and health institutes, as well as 105 participating hospitals. Each week, the percentage of positive cases among all specimens was reported for each pathogen. We calculated the average monthly positive detection rates (PDRs) of 7 respiratory viruses (adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, corona virus, rhinovirus, and bocavirus) and 4 acute diarrhea viruses (adenovirus, rotavirus, norovirus, and astrovirus).

The seasonal ARIMA model assumes that the current observation is related to past observations through time. The general multiplicative form of the ARIMA model is written as follows: ARIMA (p, d, q) \u00d7 (P, D, Q). This model has non-seasonal, autoregressive, and moving average parameters of orders p and q, seasonal, autoregressive, and moving average parameters of order P and Q, and two non-seasonal and seasonal differencing parameters of orders d and D, respectively. To determine the general form of the model to be fit, residual ACF (Autocorrelation Function) was examined. Considering the ACF graphs, different ARIMA models were identified for model selection (Fig. 1\n, Supplemental Fig. 1). The model of the minimum Akaike\u2019s information criterion (AIC) was selectd as the best-fit model. The Granger approach [10] was used to investigate how many of the current values in the time series y could be explained by other values in the time series y. The commonly used EViews software was originally developed for use in economics, but it can be useful in other statistical applications; EViews version 5.0 (http://www.eviews.com/) was used to analyze the data. The null hypotheses were that series x does not Granger-cause series y in the first regression, and that y does not Granger-cause x in the second regression. Seasonal differences in newly diagnosed childhood cancer were analyzed using the Chi-Square test, and P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",

Childhood ALL is a relatively well-known disease associated with infection, with a peak age of development of between 2 and 5 years. The disease is associated with industrialization and modern societies, and increased prevalence has led to the formulation of two infection-based hypotheses: Kinlen\u2019s \u201cpopulation-mixing\u201d hypothesis, and Greaves\u2019 \u201cdelayed-infection\u201d hypothesis [15], [16]. Kinlen\u2019s hypothesis predicts that clusters of childhood ALL cases result from the exposure of susceptible individuals to common, but fairly innocuous infections after population-mixing with carriers [15]. The delayed-infection hypothesis of Greaves is based on a minimal \u201ctwo-hit\u201d model; it suggests that some susceptible individuals have a prenatally acquired, pre-leukemic allele, and that these individuals had little or no exposure to common infections early in life because they live in an affluent hygienic environment [16]. Such insulation from infection predisposes the immune system of these individuals to aberrant or pathological responses after subsequent or delayed exposure to common infections at an age when there is increased lymphoid-cell proliferation.",

In the present study, we could not classify the patients\u2019 stages; however, stage 4S NBL accounts for less than 5% of all NBL cases, so our seasonal NBL pattern is surely different from that reported in the Italian study [18]. With regards to AML, while ALL and AML are biologically different diseases with distinct etiologies [19], it is possible that different infectious agents play a role in the development of both. Our preliminary evidence for seasonal peaks in several diseases warrants further investigation. We also found significant July and winter peaks in the diagnosis of GCTs.

Approximately 18% of the global cancer burden has been attributed to infectious agents, with estimates ranging from 7% in developed countries to about 22% in developing countries [20]. Chronic infections by the hepatitis B and C viruses, human papilloma virus, and Helicobacter pylori are reportedly responsible for approximately 15% of all human cancers, especially in adults. Malignancies known to be associated with infection have been considered as resulting from the prolonged latency that occurs in chronic infections. In general, pathogenic infections could be necessary, but not sufficient for the initiation and progression of many cancers. That is, cancer initiation may require additional co-factors, including secondary infections [5]. Therefore, in patients with chronic infection by one agent, a secondary co-infection with another agent may be an important co-factor in cancer initiation and progression. Co-infections are relatively common in areas with a high prevalence of infectious agents, especially in developing countries. These co-infections can cause an imbalance in the host immune system by affecting the persistence of, and susceptibility to, malignant infections.",

Second, we had no information regarding the month of onset of clinical symptoms, which may be a more important indicator because there may be considerable variability in the time between the first appearance of symptoms and diagnosis. Thirdly, there may have been selection bias: although duplicated patients were excluded, it is possible that some of the patients had been diagnosed before the study period. This selection bias is inevitable in cross-sectional cohort studies; however, more long-term study could minimize such bias. The fourth, this type of study cannot evaluate exposure to specific infectious agents, and individual exposures to certain virus could not be confirmed in the open data source.
