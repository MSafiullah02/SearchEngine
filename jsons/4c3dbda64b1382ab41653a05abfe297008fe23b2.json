The \u03b1SIP molecule consisted of a single chain antibody (scFv) specific for the porcine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) linked to the \u03b1-CH3 domain from human IgA. To express the full-length IgA, the individual light and heavy chains from the TGEV-specific mAb 6A.C3 were inserted into separate PVX constructs and plants were co-infected with both constructs. Western blot analysis revealed the efficient expression of both the SIP and IgA molecules. Analysis of crude plant extracts revealed that both the plant-expressed \u03b1SIP and IgA molecules could bind to and neutralize TGEV in tissue culture, indicating that active molecules were produced. Oral administration of crude extracts from antibody-expressing plant tissue to 2-day-old piglets showed that both the \u03b1SIP and full-length IgA molecules can provide in vivo protection against TGEV.",

This approach, termed passive immunization, has been extensively investigated in the case of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). This virus infects both enteric and respiratory tissues, and causes close to 100% mortality in newborn pigs [1] . A mAb, 6A.C3, has been identified that is able to neutralize all TGEV isolates tested. This mAb recognizes a highly conserved epitope of the spike (S) globular protein that is probably essential for virus replication, since no neutralization escape mutants have been found [2] . A recombinant murine-porcine immunoglobulin A (IgA) isotype of mAb 6A.C3 produced in the milk of transgenic mice has been shown to be highly effective in the neutralization of TGEV when supplied orally [3, 4] . In addition, small immune proteins (SIPs; [5] ), derived from mAb 6A.C3, expressed in mammalian cells",

            "text": "If passive immunization against TGEV, or other enteric pathogens, is to become a practical reality, it will be essential that large amounts of the appropriate antibody be produced at low cost. The production of biopharmaceuticals, such as vaccines or antibodies, by genetic engineering in plants has several advantages over methods based on bacterial or animal cell systems, including low cost, low risk of toxicity or contamination by animal pathogens, and the feasibility for large-scale production [6, 7] . Frequently, transgenic plants have been used to express relevant molecules for use in the formulation of experimental vaccines for humans and animals. Expression of recombinant antibodies (rAbs) has great potential to protect against viral infections and a wide variety of different rAbs has been successfully expressed in transgenic plants [6] . However, the use of transgenic plants for the expression of antibodies has nevertheless some disadvantages, such as the long time needed to obtain appropriate transgenic lines and the low yields of the expressed protein that are frequently encountered. In addition, the production of full-length antibodies depends on the simultaneous expression of the light (L) and heavy (H) chain peptides, which usually requires the time-consuming procedure of obtaining genetic crosses among the two types of transgenic plants.",

            "text": "An alternative approach for obtaining high levels of expression of foreign proteins in plants is to transiently express the gene of interest from a recombinant plant virus vector. Since viral genomes multiply within infected cells, this generally leads to the accumulation of high levels of the protein. Several plant viruses have been successfully engineered into vectors for the expression of foreign genes. We have previously reported the expression of a small immune protein (\u03b5SIP), consisting of a singlechain antibody (scFv) derived from mAb 6A.C3 fused to the CH4 domain of the S2 isoform of human IgE, in plants by means of cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV)-and potato virus X (PVX)-derived expression vectors [8] . This version of a SIP molecule was selected because the chains are able dimerize efficiently and stably via a cysteine residue at the C terminus of the CH4 domain of IgE S2. Plant extracts containing the SIP molecules were able to neutralize TGEV in tissue culture. Furthermore, oral administration of crude extracts from SIP-expressing plant tissue to 2-day-old piglets demonstrated that those extracts that showed the highest levels of in vitro neutralization could also provide in vivo protection against challenge with TGEV. However, the protection of the newborn animals was lower than that afforded by the full-length recombinant IgA, produced in mammalian cells, on which it was based. The potentially higher stability of the full-length secreted IgA antibody and derivatives based on it, espe-cially on the mucosal surfaces, may be the reason behind the different behavior of the two types of antibody molecule. Alternatively, it may reflect the fact that the fulllength mAb is able to mediate additional mechanisms of protection, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), which will not be invoked by the SIP molecule as it lacks the relevant portions of the constant region of the full-length antibody.",

To achieve this, the forward primer ACTCTAGCCAAGCTTGTCGGGGCCCGGCTGGAG CCTGATCCTCCTGTTCCTCGTCGCTGTGGCTACAGG TGTGCACTCGGACATTGTGATGACCC was used. The reverse primer GCTAACCGAGAATTCTCAGAGTTCGT CGTGGTAGCAGGTGCCGTCCACC was used to fuse the sequence encoding an ER retention signal, HDEL, to the C terminus of the CH3 domain. The resulting construct (pYP-1), containing the modified version of the \u03b1SIP, was digested with ApaI and EcoRV and the 1.5-kb fragment encoding the sequence of the SIP was used to replace that of GFP in ApaI/StuI-digested pBinP-NS-1 to give plasmid pBinP-YP1. For cloning in pGR106, the \u03b1SIP gene in pcDNA-6AC3-hu\u03b1sip was amplified by PCR, using CCATC-GATCCATGGGCTGGAGC as the forward primer to produce \u03b1SIP constructs with its original murine leader peptide. A ClaI site (underlined) was introduced upstream of the SIP-specific sequence. As reverse primer GCGTC-GACTCAGTAGCAGGTG containing a SalI site (underlined), was used. For cloning of rIgA chains in pGR106, the sequences encoding the L and H chains of mAb 6A.C3 were amplified by PCR using the forward primers CCATCGATGGCGCGCCATGGAGTCACAGATTCAG, which includes an AscI site (underlined), and CCATC-GATCCATGAAATGCAGCTGGGTC, with a ClaI site (underlined), respectively. The reverse primers were: GCGTCGACTAAGCCTCACACTCATTC and GCGTC-GACTATCCAACCAGGTATG for L and H chains, respectively. Both include an SalI site (underlined). The PCR products were digested with ClaI and SalI for the \u03b1SIP and H chain, and with AscI and SalI for the L chain, and ligated into ClaI/SalI-or AscI/SalI-digested pGR106 to give pGR106-hu\u03b1SIP, pGR106-LC and pGR106-HC. The structure of the \u03b1SIP and L and H chains constructs was verified by sequence analysis before appropriate Agrobacterium strains were transfected by electroporation. A. tumefaciens strain GV3010 was used for pGR106-antibody constructs and strain LBA4404 for pBinP-YP1.",

Extracts were further administered over a 2-day period. After that, TGEV levels were determined in gut and lung of the challenged animals, and protection was expressed as a ratio of the virus titer obtained with antibody-containing extract, relative to the equivalent extract without the antibody (Fig. 4) . The results showed that supplying pigs orally with extracts from N. clevelandii plants expressing \u03b1SIP or full-length rIgA caused a notable reduction in virus titers compared with extracts from leaves infected with wild-type virus. Plant extracts expressing \u03b1SIP reduced TGEV titers by over 100-fold in the gut and more than 10 000-fold in the lung of the infected animals. The reduction of virus titers was lower in the gut but higher in the lung compared with that achieved with the supernatants from mammalian cells containing the \u03b1SIP (Fig. 4a) . By contrast, plant extracts containing full-length rIgA greatly reduced virus titers in the gut of challenged animals, but were almost ineffective in lungs (Fig. 4b) .",

These observations confirm and extend the results previously reported using SIP molecules based on the CH4 domain of IgE (\u03b5SIP; [8] ). The latter molecules were selected for initial study because they are able dimerize efficiently and stably via a cysteine residue at the C terminus of the CH4 domain, and it was believed that this could be important in ensuring their activity when expressed in plants. The CH3 domain of the \u03b1SIP contains a cysteine as its penultimate C-terminal amino acid but in the parental IgA molecule this is involved in binding to the J-chain rather than participating in antibody dimerization. However, recent results with \u03b1SIP molecules expressed in mammalian cells showed that in the absence of the J chain, this cysteine can also promote efficient dimerization (M. Bestagno et al., J. Gen. Virol., in press). The fact that dimeric \u03b1SIP molecules were detected in Western blots under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 2a, b) and neutralization was obtained with plant extracts containing the \u03b1SIP molecules indicates that this dimerization also occurs efficiently in plants.",

            "text": "There is a striking difference between which viral vector is most efficient for the expression of \u03b1 and \u03b5SIPs. With the \u03b5SIP, expression from CPMV resulted in approximately 20 times more protein accumulation than was found when a PVX vector was used [8] . This difference was ascribed to presence of an HDEL sequence, allowing ER retention, on the SIP expressed from CPMV, a sequence absent from the PVX-expressed protein. Thus, the PVX-expressed SIP is expected to be secreted to the apoplast. By contrast, in the current report, higher levels of expression were obtained with PVX compared with CPMV. Although the precise reasons for this difference have not been investigated in detail, they probably reflect a combination of factors. For example, the relatively high levels of accumulation of \u03b1SIP expressed from PVX may reflect the greater stability of an SIP based on a secretory antibody (IgA) in the relatively hostile environment of the apoplast compared with that based on IgE. Alternatively, the difference may reflect some aspect of how well the various heterologous sequences are tolerated by the different virus vectors. Whatever the precise cause, the difference in expression levels indicates that optimization of expression strategy and targeting is likely to be required to achieve maximum accumulation levels of individual antibody constructs.",

However, the plantexpressed SIP molecule appears to be considerably more effective than the full-length antibody at reducing the virus titer in the lungs. This may be a consequence of the smaller size of the SIP molecules allowing more efficient release from the crude plant extract so that it can penetrate the animal tissue more readily. It may also reflect the generally greater tissue penetration found with SIP molecules [17] , although this might also be expected to occur when SIP molecules expressed in mammalian cells are administered, which was not observed in our experiments (Fig. 4) . One possible explanation is that other materials within the plant extracts have a protective-adjuvant role but we have no direct evidence to support this conclusion.",
