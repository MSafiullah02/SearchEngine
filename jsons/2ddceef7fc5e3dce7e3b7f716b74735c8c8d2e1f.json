Abstract The genome of citrus tristeza virus (CTV), genus Closterovirus family Closteroviridae, is a single-stranded (+) RNA potentially encoding at least 17 proteins. One (p23), an RNA-binding protein of 209 amino acids with a putative Zn-finger and some basic motifs, displays singular features: (i) it has no homologues in other closteroviruses, (ii) it accumulates mainly in the nucleolus and Cajal bodies, and in plasmodesmata, and (iii) it mediates asymmetric accumulation of CTV RNA strands, intracellular suppression of RNA silencing, induction of some CTV syndromes and enhancement of systemic infection when expressed as a transgene ectopically or in phloem-associated cells in several Citrus spp. Here, a yeast two-hybrid screening of an expression library of Nicotiana benthamiana (a symptomatic experimental host for CTV), identified a transducin/WD40 domain protein and the cytosolic glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as potential host interactors with p23. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation corroborated the p23-GAPDH interaction in planta and showed that p23 interacts with itself in the nucleolus, Cajal bodies and plasmodesmata, and with GAPDH in the cytoplasm (forming aggregates) and in plasmodesmata. The latter interaction was preserved in a p23 deletion mutant affecting the C-terminal domain, but not in two others affecting the Zn-finger and one internal basic motif. Virus-induced gene silencing of GAPDH mRNA resulted in a decrease of CTV titer as revealed by real-time RT-quantitative PCR and RNA gel-blot hybridization. Thus, like other viruses, CTV seems to co-opt GAPDH, via interaction with p23, to facilitate its infectious cycle.",

First, when expressed as a transgeneectopically or in phloem-associated cells-it elicits CTVlike symptoms in several Citrus spp., but not in Nicotiana spp. (Fagoaga et al. 2005; Ghorbel et al. 2001; Soler et al. 2014) ; in agreement with this feature, the polymorphism of a specific p23 region allows discrimination between mild and severe CTV isolates (Sambade et al. 2003) .

            "text": "Dissecting the interactions between virus-and hostencoded proteins has contributed significantly to our understanding of the dynamics of viral infection. Complexes between both kinds of proteins and viral genomes mediate replication, intercellular movement and systemic trafficking of viruses (Heinlein 2015) . Replication of typical RNA viruses takes place in the cytoplasm in organelle-like membranous vesicles, called viral replication complexes (VRC) or \"viral factories\", formed by host components and viral-encoded proteins (den Boon and Ahlquist 2010). The movement proteins encoded by some plant RNA viruses may bind to the VRC and facilitate their association with plasmodesmata and the subsequent viral spread (Heinlein 2015) . Most proteins encoded by viruses, including suppressors of RNA silencing, are multifunctional and can operate as pathogenicity determinants, triggering the host defensive responses and also usurping and redirecting host pathways for virus replication and spread (Garc\u00eda and Pall\u00e1s 2015) . Considering the unique properties of p23, we have examined in yeast a library of N. benthamiana for proteins interacting with it. After confirming independently in planta the interaction with one of the two candidates retrieved, the cytosolic glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), we have mapped the p23 domains involved in such interaction, and investigated the role of GAPDH in CTV accumulation.",

For each interaction four dilutions (10 \u22121 , 10 \u22122 , 10 \u22123 and 10 \u22124 ) of the diploid yeast cell culture, normalized at 5 \u00d7 10 4 cells and expressing both bait and prey constructs, were spotted on several selective media. The DO-2 selective medium lacking tryptophan and leucine was used as a growth control. The identification of N. benthamiana proteins interacting with p23 was based on the reporter gene HIS3 (growth assay without histidine). For this aim, the different dilutions were also spotted on the selective medium DO-3 without tryptophan, leucine and histidine (Fig. 1a) . Four increasing concentrations of 3-aminotriazol (3-AT), an inhibitor of the product of gene HIS3, were added to the DO-3 plates to intensify stringency and reduce possible auto-activation by p23 (Fig. 1b) . The interactions of p23 with GAPDH and a transducin/WD40 domain protein were still visible when the selection medium was supplemented with 10 mM 3-AT. Because the transducin/WD40 construct isolated in the Y2H screening contained a stop codon between the Gal4 activation domain (Gal4-AD) and the transducin WD40 fragment, we suspected that this stop codon was partially over-read thus producing enough functional fusion protein to allow growth on the selective medium. Therefore, a fragment without this stop codon was cloned in frame with the Gal4-AD and tested for its potential interaction with p23. The interaction resisted a selection pressure up to 100 mM 3-AT, while the initial prey clone with the stop codon did not grow under these conditions (Fig. 1b) . This result was most likely due to the production of a higher amount of the correct fusion protein, indicating that the transducin/WD40 fragment indeed interacted with p23. No growth was observed in the negative controls.",

In contrast, when the binary plasmid expressing sYFPN-p23 was co-infiltrated with that expressing sYFPC, or the binary plasmid expressing sYFPC-p23 was co-infiltrated with that expressing sYFPN, no fluorescence was detected (data not shown).

In view of its high protein-coding capacity, CTV-host interactions must be multiple and complex. To get a deeper insight into such interactions, we focused on p23 given the singular features of this protein with roles on the accumulation of CTV RNA strands, RNA silencing suppression, pathogenesis and virus movement . We first screened a library of N. benthamiana, expressed in yeast, to search for proteins interacting with p23. We deliberately chose such a library from N. benthamiana, and not others from Arabidopsis thaliana, because the former is an experimental host for at least one CTV isolate (T36) (Ambr\u00f3s et al. 2011) , thus increasing the chances of detecting interactions physiologically meaningful. The analysis retrieved two major partners: the cytosolic GAPDH and a transducin/ WD40 domain protein. The first one, a promising candidate because it modulates the infectious cycle of different viruses (see below), was confirmed to interact with p23 in planta by BiFC, using again N. benthamiana. Incidentally, BiFC also showed that GAPDH interacts with itself, in agreement with its homotetrameric nature (Jenkins and Tanner 2006) , as also does p23, a novel property of this protein that may have functional implications. Other CTV self-interacting proteins include p20 and p33 Kang et al. 2017) . Analysis of three deletion and two substitution mutants mapped the p23 domain(s) interacting with GAPDH to the N-terminal moiety, with a net positive charge, which has also been involved in other functions of p23 ).",

However, when interacting with GAPDH, p23 was only detected in plasmodesmata as well as in the cytoplasm (the major accumulation site of GAPDH). These results are consistent with GAPDH assisting p23 in viral cell-to-cell movement through plasmodesmata. Besides its localization in these channels traversing cell walls, involvement of p23 in CTV movement is supported by the phloem escape of the virus observed in p23-expressing transgenic sweet orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osb.) and sour orange (C. aurantium L.) and by the enhancement of systemic infection (and virus accumulation) in the less-susceptible sour orange host (Fagoaga et al. 2011) .

This multifunctional protein has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes other than its key role in glycolysis, including replication/accumulation and gene expression of certain singlestranded (+) RNA viruses (White and Garcin 2016) , as well as in their movement (see above). The GAPDH amino acid sequence is highly conserved across species, as also is its RNA-binding ability (White and Garcin 2016) , which most likely mediates many of its extra-glycolytic functions. Replication of single-stranded (+) RNA viruses starts producing (\u2212) RNA strands, which are the template for synthesis of (+) RNA progeny strands in an asymmetric process resulting in a 10-to 1000-fold excess of the latter. This ratio is approximately 10:1 for flaviviruses (Chambers et al. 1990) , 20:1 for tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) (Pogany and Nagy 2008) , 50-100:1 for coronaviruses (Lai and Cavanagh 1997) , 100:1 for brome mosaic virus (French and Ahlquist 1987; Marsh et al. 1991) , and 1000:1 for alfalfa mosaic virus (Nassuth and Bol 1983) .

The majority of RNA viruses with which GAPDH interacts have single-stranded (+) genomes, with this protein being coopted to either stabilize the viral RNA and/or alter the progeny ratio of (+) to (\u2212) strands. More specifically, GAPDH stabilizes the genomic RNA of hepatitis C virus by binding to its 3\u2032-UTR (Petrik et al. 1999) , as also does with the genomic RNA of hepatitis A virus by competing with other cellular proteins for RNA binding (Dollenmaier and Weitz 2003; Yi et al. 2000) ; however, GAPDH binds preferentially the (\u2212) RNA strand of Japanese encephalitis virus, remaining unclear the biological consequences of this interaction (Yang et al. 2009 ). In the context of plant RNA viruses, knockdown of GAPDH in N. benthamiana showed that GAPDH binding to the 3\u2032-UTR of the genomic RNAs of bamboo mosaic virus and its satellite virus, prevents transcription of the (\u2212) RNA and halts the replication process reducing the ratio of (\u2212) to (+) strands (Prasanth et al. 2011 ). On the other hand, by binding selectively to an AU pentameric sequence close to the 3\u2032 terminus of the (\u2212) RNA strand of TBSV, GAPDH retains this strand in the replication complex for its reiterative copying to produce an excess of (+) RNA strands. In fact, depletion of GAPDH preferentially inhibits the accumulation of (+) RNA, resulting in a 1:1 ratio of (+) to (\u2212) RNA products in yeast and in N. benthamiana (Wang and Nagy 2008; Huang and Nagy 2011) .",

However, since the decrease was similar for both strands (about 29-32% and 26-49%, respectively), their ratio remained essentially unchanged. Considering the rather complex experimental design, involving VIGS of GAPDH mRNA and 15 days later infection by CTV, with its strand accumulation being examined after other additional 21 days, it is likely that adjusting these time lapses could result in even more pronounced effects. Moreover, changes in the sour orange transcriptome 4 months after infection with the asymptomatic CTV isolate T385 include the overexpression of GAPDH (Comellas 2009 ). In summary, results from VIGS of GAPDH mRNA in an experimental system (N. benthamiana) together with the overaccumulation of this RNA during infection of a natural host (sour orange), support the involvement of GAPDH in facilitating the CTV infectious cycle.",
