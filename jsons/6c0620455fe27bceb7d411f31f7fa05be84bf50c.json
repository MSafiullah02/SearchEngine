To understand the transmission mechanism of this highly contagious virus, it is necessary to study the potential factors, including meteorological conditions. Here, we present a machine learning approach to study the effect of temperature, humidity and wind speed on the number of infected people in the three most populous autonomous communities in Spain. We find that there is a moderate inverse correlation between temperature and the daily number of infections. This correlation manifests for temperatures recorded up to 6 days before the onset, which corresponds well to the known mean incubation period of COVID-19. We also show that the correlation for humidity and wind speed is not significant.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is an infectious disease first reported in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019. This disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1, 2] , which has spread rapidly around the world. In response to this outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) characterised COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March [3] . As of today, the current COVID-19 outbreak situation has confirmed over 3 million cases and 208 thousand deaths globally [4] . Spain is one of the most affected countries with over 210 thousand confirmed cases and 23 thousand confirmed deaths [5] (data reported on April 28th 2020). COVID-19 infection could cause severe respiratory disorders with symptoms such as fever, coughing and shortness of breath. The average incubation period is 5-6 days with the longest incubation period of 14 days [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] . In addition to person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 through direct contact or droplets [11] , studies have shown that geographical, and climatic factors are important factors in the transmission and survival of coronaviruses [12, 2, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] . For example, temperature could increase or decrease the transmission risk by affecting the survival time of coronaviruses on surfaces [18, 19, 20, 21, 22] . Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many researchers have focused their efforts in understanding the influencing factors and transmission mechanism of this virus. These efforts are motivated by previous investigations on other viral infectious diseases such as SARS and Influenza. SARS is another coronavirus type that appeared in 2002 and caused a pandemic with more than 8 thousand infected people in 26 countries. Noticeable correlations between the SARS cases and the environmental temperature were reported [19, 23] . SARS transmission appeared to be dependent on seasonal temperature changes and the multiplicative effect of hospital infection [24] . It has also been documented that several factors, including climatic conditions (temperature and humidity), and population density might have affected the patterns of influenza spread and diversification [25] .",

Figure 2 shows the daily increment of infected people for the communities of Madrid, Catalu\u00f1a, and Anadaluc\u00eda from March 1st until April 28th, 2020. All the three communities reached the peak of daily infections until the end of March with an upward trend during the month. A state of alarm and a national lockdown was imposed on March 14th [36], whose effect manifests as a downward trend in the number of daily cases from the beginning of April (day 31). To minimise the impacts of the lockdown on our analysis, we consider the upward transmission period during March, see Fig 2. Also, we focus our case study on the last 17 days of March to capture all the possible transmissions during the first 14 days, known as the maximum incubation period for the virus [8, 9, 10] .",

Like other correlation coefficients, the Pearson's correlation varies between -1 and +1 with 0 implying no correlation. The p-value roughly indicates the probability of an uncorrelated system producing datasets that have a Pearson correlation at least as extreme as the one computed from these datasets. We also employ linear regression, a supervised machine learning technique, to find the relationship between the most important predictors and the target [37] . Here, we use Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to estimate the unknown regression coefficients. A range of plausible values for these coefficients can be obtained by calculating confidence intervals. Figure 3 presents the correlation between the meteorological predictors and the daily increment of infected people (target). It is interesting to observe that the averages of temperature up to the previous 6 days (T-AVG, and T-AVG-1 to -6) show a moderate negative correlation range between -0.7 to -0.5 (p-value < 10 \u22123 ). This result corresponds well with the mean incubation period of COVID-19, which was estimated to be 5-6 days [8, 9, 10] . We note that none of the 14 temperature predictors shows a positive correlation with the target. Humidity and wind speed do not indicate this consistency, and they also show a weak correlation in the range of -0.5 to 0.5.",

In other words, a 1 o C increase in average temperature leads to a decrease of 194 daily positive cases (95% CI, 140 to 248). We also perform linear regression considering the other important temperature predictors. Table 2 summarizes the regression coefficients. The coefficient of \u03b2 1 shows a range from -178 o C \u22121 to -136 o C \u22121 , while the intercept \u03b2 0 varies from 2691 to 3556 among different predictors.",

This result is relevant since the mean incubation period of COVID-19 is known to be around 5-6 days [8] . We have also performed a linear regression which has shown a decrease of about 200 daily infected people per 1 o C increase in average temperature. We note that due to several uncertainties involved in testing and collecting the number of infected people, and other factors affecting the transmission, our analysis and results need to be interpreted with caution. However, our results could provide a clue to understanding the transmission mechanism of COVID-19.",
