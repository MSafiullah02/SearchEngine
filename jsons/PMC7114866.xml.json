PDCoV infection is marked by acute, watery diarrhea and vomiting, ultimately leading to dehydration and mortality in suckling piglets (Jung et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2015). Since its first discovery in Hong Kong in 2012 (Woo et al., 2012), this virus has emerged globally, especially in the North American and Asian pig-producing countries (Lee and Lee, 2014; Madapong et al., 2016; Saeng-Chuto et al., 2017; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; Woo et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014; Marthaler et al., 2014).",

Infected small intestinal enterocytes undergo vacuolation and extensive exfoliation of the villous epithelium, followed by villous atrophy (Chen et al., 2015; Jang et al., 2018; Jung et al., 2015). The massive loss of enterocytes hampers the absorption and digestion of nutrients and electrolytes in the small intestine, thereby causing malabsorptive and maldigestive diarrhea and the consequent fatal dehydration in piglets (Jung et al., 2015). The pathophysiological change, including vacuolar degeneration and eventual death of enterocytes, is likely associated with necrosis caused by the cytolytic action of the virus, as PDCoV fails to induce apoptosis in infected intestinal enterocytes in vivo (Jung et al., 2016).",

Cytopathic effects (CPE) of PDCoV in both cell lines are comparable and consist of enlarged, rounded, and granular cells that undergo cell shrinkage and detachment (Hu et al., 2015; Jang et al., 2018). In contrast to in vivo circumstances, the cytopathological alteration in PDCoV-infected LLC-PK and ST cells are known to occur via apoptosis and directly related to the viral replication in vitro (Jung et al., 2016). However, the molecular mechanisms that induce apoptosis in PDCoV-infected cell lines remain poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to define the specific pathways involved in the apoptotic death of PDCoV-infected ST cells in vitro.",

ST cells were infected with PDCoV and CPE were monitored after infection. Light microscopy of PDCoV-infected ST cells indicated typical CPE characterized by cell rounding, clumping as clusters, and detachment, which were visible starting at 6 hpi and became prominent by 12 hpi (Fig. 1\nA, upper panels). To detect the intracellular fragmented DNA, cellular DNA from mock- or virus-infected cells was harvested and subjected to a DNA laddering assay. Consistent with the results of CPE observation, intracellular DNA fragmentation appeared at 6 hpi and the DNA ladder pattern was apparent at 9 hpi (Fig. 1A, lower panel). This characteristic of apoptosis was further verified using a TUNEL assay. As shown in Fig. 1B, TUNEL-labeled (DNA damage and dead) cells were only observed within virus-infected cells as compared to mock-infected cells. The process of PDCoV-induced apoptosis was then assessed by staining the virus- and mock-infected cells with Annexin V/PI followed by FACS analysis to quantitatively determine the percentage of viable, apoptotic, and dead cells. PDCoV infection produced a significant level of apoptosis (Annexin V positive/PI negative) at 6 hpi. The percentage of early-stage apoptotic cells increased with the progression of infection and reached a maximum of 41.6% at 24 hpi (Fig. 1C). In addition, comparable kinetics of apoptosis were observed in ST cells infected with PDCoV at an MOI of 0.1 (data not shown). Taken together, these data confirm that PDCoV infection induced apoptosis in vitro.",

The results of the MTT assay revealed that none of the tested Z-VAD-FMK doses caused any change in the cell viability (data not shown).

Virus production was determined by monitoring the strength of CPE and confirmed with immunofluorescence at 24 hpi (Fig. 2B). Vehicle-treated control cells showed CPE and were positive for PDCoV N protein-specific staining, indicating infection and spread of the virus to neighboring cells. However, the inhibitory effect of Z-VAD-FMK on viral propagation was clearly detectable.

Z-VAD-FMK inhibited viral replication by nearly 90% at the highest concentration tested (Fig. 2C).

Although both pathways engage the same proteolytic caspase cascade and interface at the point of downstream executioner caspase-3 activation, initiator caspase-8 and caspase-9 discriminate between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, respectively (Clarke and Tyler, 2009). To identify the apoptosis pathway induced by PDCoV, specific inhibitors of caspase-8 or caspase-9 were used. ST cells were pretreated with Z-IETD-FMK (caspase-8 inhibitor) or Z-LEHD-FMK (caspase-9 inhibitor) at concentrations of 50 and 100 \u03bcM or DMSO and subjected to virus infection. PDCoV growth measured by CPE observation and IFA was similar between cells treated with Z-IETD-FMK and DMSO (Fig. 3\nA). In contrast, treatment with Z-LEHD-FMK dramatically weakened PDCoV infectivity in ST cells. The level of PDCoV replication was indirectly measured by the quantification of cells expressing N protein using flow cytometry (Fig. 3B). No impairment in PDCoV propagation was observed in the presence of Z-IETD-FMK, while the treatment of cells with 100 \u03bcM Z-LEHD-FMK resulted in \u226580% decrease in PDCoV infection as compared with the control group (DMSO-treated cells). The expression level of PDCoV N protein in the presence of each inhibitor or DMSO was also evaluated with Western blot analysis. Only caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK exerted a detrimental effect on the viral protein production (Fig. 3C). Densitometric analysis of Western blots revealed that the intracellular expression of N protein was effectively prevented by Z-LEHD-FMK, with an approximately 70% reduction at the highest concentration tested.",

Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) leads to the release of cyt c, which sequentially activates initiator caspase-9 and downstream effector caspase-3, thereby orchestrating the final apoptotic response (Clarke and Tyler, 2009). To study the potential role of MOMP in the caspase-dependent pathway of PDCoV-induced apoptosis, we determined the subcellular localization of Bax and cyt c in PDCoV-infected cells using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 6\nA, Bax continued to be localized broadly in the mitochondria after PDCoV infection, evident from its colocalization with a mitochondrial-specific marker. On the other hand, cyt c was present in the cytosolic region and failed to colocalize with the mitochondria marker in the majority of cells infected with PDCoV. These observations were confirmed by Western blot analysis with mitochondrial and cytosolic or nuclear extracts. In comparison with mock-infected cells, PDCoV-infected cells exhibited an independent increase in levels of Bax and cyt c in the mitochondrial and cytosolic extracts, respectively (Fig. 6B, first and second panels). To eliminate the possibility of association between caspase-independent process and PDCoV-triggered apoptosis, we analyzed the translocation of another apoptogenic molecule, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), which is proteolytically cleaved and released into the nucleus by MOMP to execute caspase-independent intrinsic apoptosis (Galluzzi et al., 2012). In contrast to cyt c, AIF was detected in the mitochondria but absent in the nucleus throughout PDCoV infection period, as demonstrated from AIF and MitoTracker colocalization and AIF detection in mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 6A and B). AIF retention in the mitochondria during PDCoV infection was concurrent with the execution of caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death by PDCoV as described above. Thus, PDCoV infection triggers Bax recruitment into the mitochondria, leading to MOMP and the consequent release of mitochondrial cyt c to commit cells to death.",

            "text": "The present study demonstrates the translocation of the mitochondrial cyt c into the cytoplasm by Bax-mediated MOMP following PDCoV infection. Along with this mechanism, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) is considered as the most viable model of mitochondrial channels that accounts for MOMP (Suh et al., 2013; Mathupala et al., 2006). Cyclophilin D (CypD) is localized to the mitochondrial membrane matrix and acts as a key component in the process of MPTP opening (Baines et al., 2005; Schinzel et al., 2005). Therefore, we evaluated if CypD inhibition may prevent apoptotic cell death induced by PDCoV. ST cells were treated with cyclosporin A (CsA), a chemical inhibitor of CypD, to prevent MPTP opening upon PDCoV infection. Following CsA treatment, PDCoV-induced apoptosis was quantitatively measured by Annexin V/PI flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 7\nA, treatment with CsA notably decreased the percentage of PDCoV-induced early apoptotic cells (second panel) by 7.7\u201311.8% during the course of PDCoV infection (compared to Fig. 2A). DNA laddering assay indicated that Z-VAD-FMK or CsA treatment in PDCoV-infected cells completely abolished the intracellular DNA fragmentation (Fig. 7B, lanes 3 and 4), while cells infected with PDCoV alone clearly displayed a DNA laddering pattern (Fig. 7B, lane 2). These results indicate that CsA-mediated CypD inhibition efficiently suppressed apoptotic cell death executed by PDCoV, suggesting that PDCoV infection may regulate the opening of MPTP.",

PDCoV replication was determined by monitoring virus-specific CPE and verified by IFA at 24 hpi (Fig. 8\nA). In contrast to vehicle-treated control cells, cells treated with CsA showed a strong inhibitory effect on PDCoV propagation, as evident from the dramatic decrease in virus-induced CPE and viral gene expression. The number of cells expressing viral antigen, as quantified by N protein staining, reduced during CsA treatment, with almost 90% inhibition observed at 10 \u03bcM concentration (Fig. 8B). We also treated cells with an AIF inhibitor, N-phenylmaleimide (N-PhMI), as a negative chemical control that prevents AIF-induced caspase-independent apoptosis (Kim and Lee, 2014; Susin et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2007). Unlike CsA, N-PhMI treatment was incapable of inhibiting PDCoV infection even at the highest concentration used (Fig. 8A and B). To further examine the antiviral activity of CsA against PDCoV replication, virus production was determined in the presence or absence of CsA. Western blot analysis revealed that 10 \u03bcM CsA treatment significantly prevented the intracellular expression of the viral protein (Fig. 9\nA). After infection, viral supernatants were collected at 24 hpi and viral titers were measured. As shown in Fig. 9B, CsA treatment significantly reduced the release of viral progeny in a dose-dependent manner. The peak viral titer was determined as 107\u00b75 TCID50/ml for the vehicle-treated control, whereas the addition of 10 \u03bcM CsA declined PDCoV titer to 102\u00b77 TCID50/ml (almost 5-log reduction as compared with the control). The study of growth kinetics further demonstrated that the overall process of PDCoV replication was severely interfered by CsA (Fig. 9C). Taken together, CsA proficiently suppressed PDCoV replication and inhibited PDCoV-induced apoptosis.",

In this direction, we determined whether CsA specifically affects the cytosolic translocation of cyt c mediated by PDCoV infection. Confocal microscopy results demonstrated that cyt c release in PDCoV-infected cells was distinctly hampered following CsA-mediated inhibition of CypD and cyt c was distributed in the mitochondria during PDCoV infection (Fig. 10\nA). Mitochondrial retention of cyt c in the presence of CsA was confirmed by a cell fractionation assay. As expected, the level of cyt c in cytosolic fractions was barely detectable in the presence of CsA, demonstrating that CypD inhibition failed to cause the release of cyt c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm (Fig. 10B, first panel). Although an increase in Bax level was observed in the mitochondria after 12 hpi (Fig. 10B, lanes 3 and 4 in second panel), CsA treatment reduced mitochondrial Bax (lane 2) and enhanced cytosolic Bax in PDCoV infected cells than in mock-infected cells (lanes 6\u20138). Altogether, these results indicate that CypD-dependent MPTP activation upon PDCoV infection directly modulated cyt c release, the commitment step in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, thereby favoring viral replication in vitro.",

            "text": "Apoptosis or programmed cell death is an actively controlled multistep process of cell suicide that occurs in response to a variety of stress conditions, including viral infections. Considering apoptosis as one of the innate immune defense mechanisms, viruses may evade the apoptotic cell death and prolong the survival of infected cells to maximize the production of the viral progeny (Thomson, 2001). However, several viruses promote apoptosis to facilitate the release and dissemination of the viral progeny for further invasion of the neighboring cells. This irreversible death event is characterized with cytolytic features after viral infections, including CPE in vitro or/and important biological processes promoting cell damage, tissue injury, and disease severity in vivo (Clarke et al., 2009; Clarke and Tyler, 2009; DeDiego et al., 2011; Ding et al., 2013; Doley et al., 2014; Eleouet et al., 1998; Favreau et al., 2012; Kim and Lee, 2014; Lan et al., 2013; Lee and Kleiboeker, 2007; St-Louis and Archambault, 2007; Sarmento et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2015). The present study demonstrated that PDCoV triggers apoptosis in ST cells, as evident from apoptotic parameters including oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and PS exposure. This finding strongly suggests that the cytopathology of PDCoV infection represented by cell rounding, clumping, and detachment is associated with the apoptotic process that contributes to viral replication.",

To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying apoptosis caused by PDCoV, we focused on the potential involvement of the caspase cascade in the process of apoptosis upon PDCoV infection. Chemical inhibition of caspase activation was shown to prevent PDCoV-induced apoptosis and viral replication. Furthermore, treatment of cells with caspase-9 inhibitor, but not a caspase-8 inhibitor, greatly restricted PDCoV infection, indicative of the involvement of the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway in PDCoV infection. The upstream initiator caspase-9 and its downstream effector caspase-3 were proteolytically activated to induce the execution phase of apoptosis. PDCoV infection sequentially activated cleaved (active) forms of caspase-9 and caspase-3 at 6 and 12 hpi, respectively, and their levels increased thereafter with the progression of infection (Fig. 5). Thus, the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway seems to be manipulated by PDCoV to ensure competent viral replication in target cells.",

            "text": "As a response to various intracellular stimuli, both pro- and anti-apoptotic signals converge toward the mitochondrion-centered control mechanism to provoke intrinsic apoptosis. Under this circumstance, MOMP, an irreversible step leading to apoptosis execution, may be initiated at the outer membrane of the mitochondria through the pore-forming activity of pro-apoptotic Bax subfamily after their mitochondria relocation from the cytoplasm or via an abrupt increase in cell permeability through the opening of MPTP at the inner membrane (Brenner and Grimm, 2006; Galluzzi et al., 2012; Tait and Green, 2013). This phenomenon permits the release of several apoptosis-mediating molecules, normally retained within the mitochondrial intermembrane space, into the cytosol (Galluzzi et al., 2012). Of these, cytosolic cyt c assembles with other pro-apoptotic factors to form the apoptosome, which triggers the caspase-dependent proteolytic cascade (Galluzzi et al., 2012; Li et al., 1997). On the other hand, AIF, a ubiquitously expressed flavoprotein, critically functions in the caspase-independent apoptosis process by relocating into the nucleus and promoting large-scale DNA fragmentation and cell death (Galluzzi et al., 2012; Joza et al., 2001; Susin et al., 1999). As caspases are relevant to both PDCoV-induced apoptosis and viral replication, we investigated the status of cyt c release from the mitochondria of PDCoV-infected cells. The translocation of Bax into the mitochondria was observed during the early stage of PDCoV infection, wherein it likely participates in the formation of pores in MOM. At the same time, the majority of cyt c was detected and retained thereafter in the cytoplasm of PDCoV-infected cells. On the contrary, the displacement of AIF from the mitochondria to the nucleus was completely absent in PDCoV-infected cells, although porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, another swine enteric coronavirus, is known to relocate mitochondrial AIF to the nucleus to trigger apoptotic cell death (Kim and Lee, 2014). This result further supports the hypothesis that PDCoV triggers apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner. The association between PDCoV-induced apoptosis and cyt c release and the subsequent caspase activation without AIF nuclear translocation suggest that cyt c is the key pro-apoptotic factor released via alterations in the mitochondrial membrane permeability mediated by Bax proteins and acts directly to execute apoptotic cell death in PDCoV infection.",

Although we observed continuously lower levels of cytosolic Bax in PDCoV-infected cells than in mock-infected cells, we were unable to consistently detect increased levels of mitochondrial Bax throughout the entire period of PDCoV infection (Fig. 6B). This observation leads us to speculate that an alternative mechanism with regard to the opening process following MPTP formation may exist to regulate MOMP during PDCoV infection. CsA acts as a specific inhibitor of MPTP opening by inhibiting the activity of CypD that constitutes the MPTP complex in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Our results show that the pharmacological inhibition of MPTP opening with CsA suppressed PDCoV-induced apoptosis, as 80\u201390% cell survival was observed in CsA-treated cells after PDCoV infection (comparable to mock-infected cells). Furthermore, CsA exerted its antiviral activity through the inhibition of multiple steps of PDCoV life cycle, including viral protein translation and spread of viral progeny. Inhibitory activities of CsA on PDCoV infection were more efficient than those of caspase inhibitors in terms of antiviral effects (5-log versus 3-log reduction) and effective minimal doses (5 \u03bcM versus 50 \u03bcM), albeit independent treatment with each pan or specific caspase inhibitor also exhibited significant suppression of PDCoV replication in its own way. This discrimination may be attributed to the wide-spectrum antiviral effect of CsA as an inhibitor members of the cellular cyclophilin (Cyp) family via multiple simultaneous mechanisms. In particular, CsA is known to suppress the replication of a variety of RNA viruses, including nidoviruses, by affecting the function of other Cyps, such as CypA and CypB, involved in viral biosynthesis and the interaction with viral constituents (de Wilde et al., 2013; Kambara et al., 2011; Kim and Lee, 2014; Nakagawa et al., 2004; Pfefferle et al., 2011; Qing et al., 2009). Since the present study primarily focused on CypD as an MPTP opening component associated with PDCoV-induced apoptosis, no experiments were conducted to investigate the participation of other Cyps in the replication of PDCoV. However, we cannot exclude that CsA could synchronously inhibit cellular CypA and CypB that may contribute to PDCoV infection in vitro. Although potential roles of these Cyps in PDCoV replication remain to be determined, thus, it is feasible that CsA may synergistically elicit its anti-PDCoV activity through the inhibition of CypD as well as CypA or/and CypB.",

Bax translocation into the mitochondria was also inhibited by CsA at 6 dpi (Fig. 10B) when Bax recruitment into the mitochondria was maximum (Fig. 6B). Bax is displaced toward the mitochondria and may directly interact with CypD to facilitate the formation of MPTP to regulate the cyt c release (Favreau et al., 2012; Kumarswamy and Chandna, 2009; Oka et al., 2008).

PDCoV-induced apoptosis was accompanied with the activation of caspase cascades and promoted effective viral replication in vitro. The mitochondrial translocation of Bax and concomitant cytosolic release of cyt c strongly indicated that Bax-mediated MOMP induces the intrinsic cell death event after PDCoV infection. We demonstrated the essential role of MPTP in apoptosis in response to PDCoV infection. MOMP is the consequence of MPTP opening that results in the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, followed by the characteristic and specific relocalization of cyt c into the cytoplasm to mediate caspase-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of MPTP opening abrogated the life cycle of PDCoV at subcytotoxic doses. Although MOMP necessarily contributes to the execution of PDCoV-induced apoptosis, the upstream intracellular regulatory signal(s) and the viral protein(s) associated with this mitochondrion-centered intrinsic apoptotic pathway mediated by PDCoV are still unclear. Future studies are warranted to identify cellular and viral factors involved in this process. In conclusion, PDCoV infection causes the release of cyt c through MOMP activation mediated by two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms, apoptosis signaling events (Bax translocation and mitochondria permeabilization) and MPTP opening, thereby triggering caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death that is required for PDCoV replication. Our results provide insights into the comprehensive understanding of the relationship between PDCoV and host cells.",

PDCoV-infected cells were further maintained for 24 h in the presence of vehicle, Z-IETD-FMK, or Z-LEHD-FMK. PDCoV-specific CPE were observed daily and photographed at 24 hpi using an inverted microscope at a magnification of 200\u00d7 (first panels). At 12 hpi, virus-infected cells were subjected to IFA with an anti-PDCoV N antibody (second panels), followed by DAPI counterstaining (third panels) and examination under a fluorescent microscope at 200\u00d7 magnification. (B) PDCoV production in the presence of each inhibitor was calculated by measuring the percentage of cells expressing N proteins through flow cytometry. (C) Viral protein translation in the presence of Z-IETD-FMK or Z-LEHD-FMK. Inhibitor-treated ST cells were mock-infected or infected with PDCoV for 1 h and cultivated in the presence or absence of each inhibitor. At 24 hpi, cellular lysates were examined by western blotting with an antibody against PDCoV N protein. The blot was also reacted with a mouse MAb against \u03b2-actin to verify equal protein loading. Each viral protein expression was quantitatively analyzed by densitometry in terms of the density value relative to that of \u03b2-actin. Inhibitor-treated samples were compared to DMSO-treated control.
