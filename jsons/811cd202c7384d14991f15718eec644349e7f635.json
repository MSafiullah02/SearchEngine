Billions of people around the world are asked to adhere to strict shelter-in-place rules, finalised to slow down the spread of the virus. Appeals and messages are being used by leaders and policy-makers to promote pandemic response. Given the stakes at play, it is thus important for social scientists to explore which messages are most effective in promoting pandemic response. In fact, some papers in the last month have explored the effect of several messages on people's intentions to engage in pandemic response behaviour. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we explore the effect of messages on people's actual engagement, and not on intentions. Specifically, our dependent variables are the level of understanding of official COVID-19 pandemic response governmental informative panels, measured through comprehension questions, and the time spent on reading these rules. Second, we test a novel set of appeals built through the theory of norms. One message targets the personal norm (what people think is the right thing to do), one targets the descriptive norm (what people think others are doing), and one targets the injunctive norm (what people think others approve or disapprove of). Our experiment is conducted online with a representative (with respect to gender, age, and location) sample of Italians. Norms are made salient using a flier. We find that normbased fliers had no effect on comprehension and on time spent on the panels. These results suggest that norm-based interventions through fliers have very little impact on people's reading and understanding of COVID-19 pandemic response governmental rules.",

Yet, one important limitation of these works is that they focus on intentions to engage in behaviours related to pandemic response, and not on actual engagement.",

This measure is incentivised, not with money, of course, but with time. Specifically, participants in our experiment will read a series of detailed information regarding the coronavirus and then will be asked some comprehension questions. Our dependent measure will be the number of correct answers (which, as we will see, is correlated with the time spent on the panels).",

            "text": "Our second contribution is practical: we test a new set of messages to promote (our measure of) pandemic response. To develop this set of messages, we take a theory-driven approach. More than a century of research in social science has shown that people's decisions are affected by what people believe to be the norms in a given context (Durkheim, 1894 (Durkheim, /2017 Schwartz, 1977; Cialdini et al.,1990; Bicchieri, 2005) . People tend to follow what they think other people are doing (the socalled descriptive norm), what they think other people would approve of (the injunctive norm), and what they personally think is the right thing to do (the personal norm). Consequently, in recent years behavioural scientists have started using norm-based interventions to promote desirable behaviour in economic experiments (D'Adda et al. 2017; Bicchieri & Xiao, 2009; Bilancini et al. 2020; Capraro & Rand, 2018; Capraro & Vanzo, 2019; Eriksson et al. 2017; Krupka & Weber, 2009; Krupka & Weber, 2012; Kimbrough & Vostroknutov, 2016) as well as in the field (Agerstr\u00f6m et al., 2016; Croson et al., 2010; Ferraro & Price, 2013; Frey & Meier, 2004; Goldstein et al. 2008; Hallsworth et al. 2017) . Accordingly, Van Bavel et al. (2020) , in their article about what social and behavioural science can do to promote COVID-19 pandemic response, have suggested that norm-based interventions may be useful to promote pandemic response.",

The text reported in the panels was downloaded from the website of the Italian Ministry of Health.

We recruited a representative (with respect to gender, age, and location) sample of 640 Italian subjects using the online platform Lucid. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four treatments. In one treatment they were shown a flier with no explicit reference to norms (baseline), while in each of the other three treatments the flier aimed at making one of the three norms (personal, descriptive, injunctive) more salient (see Figure 1 ). In the Baseline (N=158), we invited participants to reflect on the current emergency situation. In the Personal Norm treatment (N=165), we invited participants to reflect on which behaviours they think they should keep in the current emergency situation. In the Descriptive Norm treatment (N=160), we invited participants to reflect on which behaviours they think are widespread among other people in the current emergency situation. Finally, in the Injunctive Norm treatment (N=157), we invited participants to reflect on which behaviours they think other people believe to be right in the actual emergency situation. After being shown the flier, participants read five informative panels about the recommended behaviours during the Covid-19 pandemic disease. The information in the panels was taken from the website of the Italian Ministry of Health 2 . A timer (invisible to the participants) allowed us to record the time that each participant spent on each panel. After each panel, participants had to answer a comprehension question about what they had just read; each question had three possible answers, one of which was correct. Correct answers were not incentivized with money, because we did not want to motivate participants to pay attention just for receiving a monetary payment. The flier was shown before each panel. However, after the first panel, the fliers were slightly different (see Appendix). The order of the panels as well as the order of the possible answers to the questions were fully randomized.",

We investigate the effect of norm-based interventions targeting the personal norm and the two social norms (descriptive and injunctive) on this variable. Moreover, we test the differences in the distribution of times spent on panels across treatments. The design and the analyses were preregistered at https://aspredicted.org/th7kw.pdf. Table 1 reports the demographic characteristics of the overall sample. Our sample is representative (with respect to gender, age and location) of the Italian population. In the analysis below, we drop out one participant because she spent 25 hours on the survey, probably leaving the survey open on the computer. Given that the time spent on the panels is an important measure for our analysis, we eliminate this extreme outlier which generates a huge standard deviation in the data. We begin by analyzing the percentage of correct answers that participants give to the five questions, for each treatment. Figure 2 reports the distribution of the percentage of correct answers by treatment (left panel) and the average values of the \"percentage of correct answers\" variable split by treatment (right panel). As pre-registered, we first make an overall comparison using the Kruskal-Wallis test to identify differences in the distribution across all treatments, then we compare each treatment with the Baseline using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. For the Kruskas-Wallis test we find no statistically significant difference (X 2 = 1.272; p = 0.714).

A linear regression predicting the number of correct answers as a function of the average time spent on the panels reports a statistically significant positive effect (coeff = 0.136, p < 0.001). Then we analyse the time spent on each panel across treatments. Figure 3 shows the average time spent on each treatment.

Indeed, while analysing the data, we noticed that a substantial proportion of participants had spent far too little time on the informative panels, suggesting that they had not read them. Therefore, we tried to identify, for each informative panel, two sets of participants, those who had read it and those who had not. To better appreciate differences in the time spent on the panels, we log transformed the time spent, and we looked at its distribution by panel. The left chart of Figure 4 provides evidence that the distributions of the (natural) log of the time spent on each panel tend to be bimodal. We classified a panel as \"read\" by a participant if the time that the participant spent on it was larger than the minimum frequency between the two peaks in the distribution of time spent for that panel; otherwise, we classified the panel as \"non-read\" by the participant. Averaging over panels, the first peak corresponds to about 3 seconds spent on a panel (far too little to be able to read it), while the second peak corresponds to about 57 seconds (enough for a careful reading). Being classified as \"read\" turns out to be, as expected, correlated with the number of correct answers (coeff = 9.15, p < .001).",

This is not an artifact of the ceiling effect as the fraction of correct answers is far below 100%, so that there was substantial room for potential improvements. The lack of a sizeable effect on reading was inferred from the lack of variance, across treatments, in the time spent in each informative panel. Actually, the distribution of time spent in each panel appears to be two-peaked, with one peak about a few seconds and one peak around one minute, which suggests that participants either read the panel accurately or just skipped it, but such behaviour does not seem to be affected by our norm-based intervention.",

In light of our results, which fall possibly in the cases of ineffectiveness discussed by Sunstein (2017), we recommend future research to explore the effectiveness of stronger nudges: for instance, shocking images might be used in fliers, showing hospital wards full of sick people, or even military trucks loaded with coffins (such a kind of shocking images have already been used in a variety of situations, e.g., billboards portraying car accidents and packs of cigarettes showing smoking consequences).",
