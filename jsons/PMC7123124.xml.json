            "text": "The origin of State responsibility for security predates even the Treaty of Westphalia. It is to be found in the two pillars of modernity which arguably emerged with the articulation of dual allegiance expressed in Christianity. While not arguing for an exclusive Christian viewpoint of human security, taking the particular contributions of the influence of Christian ideas about God and the State into account does shed light on the secular constellation of Statehood which continues to be the building block of the international, State-based world order. Thus these dual allegiances refer not to those separate allegiances owed God and Caesar, but instead to the dual pillars of human and especially universal human rights. Here the first pillar refers to the conception of a deity in the arcane world, conveying a human right on the human creatures of the earth created in that image.\nIn Christianity there is only one god who is fundamentally concerned with every individual person\u2019s salvation, it paves the way for modern individualism, which culminates in the assumption that the individual has inalienable rights. (H\u00f6sle 2003, 23)Building upon this argument, the second pillar confers that human right universally, on all human beings as beings created in that image.\nOnly through reflection on the transcendent god did humans emerge from their immediate unity with their political community, and no matter how much this god at first bound this community to a religious value world whose claims were even more unconditional than those of the polis, his ultimate decline left behind a social world in which even the values of one\u2019s own community appear to be objective facts that have no claim of their own to be loved or even merely obeyed. At the same time, this belief afforded a strong upswing, even an infinite emotion, to universal ideals, according to which all human beings should be regarded as equal. For if there is only one god, then he can hardly be the god of one\u2019s own people alone. (H\u00f6sle 2003, 23)Pillars one and two together lead one step further even from the separation, referred to above, between the spheres of Caesar and of God. They coalesce into a demand upon the governing State, the secular Caesarian State, to uphold the universalistic morality demanded by Christianity. \u201c[Christianity] made possible a politics that was finally free of all religious and especially ritual considerations. \u2026Through an extremely intensive moralization of the religious, it demanded an influence on politics that went far beyond what was conceivable for the ancients\u201d (H\u00f6sle 2003, 24). In doing so, Christianity set a high bar for governance and States:\nIf Christianity demanded only a retreat from the world, it would be in a sense less threatening than it actually is. The difficulty with Christianity, however, consists in the fact that it not only devalues politics, but also makes demands on politics, based on its universalistic and individualistic ethics. (H\u00f6sle 2003, 24)This process reinforced the secularity of the State, while simultaneously endowing it singularly with the authority and responsibility and accountability for a moral security: a human security. This is not to argue that either universal human rights or a State guarantee of security is accepted or implemented. It is to assert that the originating impulses exist and permeate if not penetrate the status quo, which is arguably the ideal of the universality of human security.",

It was first explicitly named in the 1994 United Nations Development Programme\u2019s (UNDP) report, New Dimensions of Human Security, yet built on a long tradition of sovereignty theory. The human security scaffold is predicated on the national responsibility to accept, promote, and protect the\u2014ever-expanding\u2014pantheon of those human rights. Nef (1999) and others count between five and seven dimensions of human security, each of them with echoes in the UN definitions of human, as well as political and social, cultural and economic rights. They are generally accepted as including: economic security, food security, health security, environmental security, personal security, community security, and political security. Given both the vagary of their definitions and the vastness of their possible scope, with the sole exception of provisions of asylum tied to political (in)security, none of these human security elements are protected by legal provisions nationally, let alone internationally. Consequently, while these elements of human security \u2018rights\u2019 have benefited from a boundless imagination, the same cannot be said for the creativity applied to their realization, which remains the responsibility of the citizen-State.",

At the same time, the very legitimacy of the world order\u2014State and NSAs all\u2014is undergoing a shift: an uncoordinated stress test whose outcome is uncertain. Indeed, the State has also undergone a transformation. While the scope of human rights has expanded, that of States\u2019 rights has both expanded and contracted, at times retracting and contracting and at others effectually expanding (again): constrained first by the Cold War logic of mutually assured destruction (MAD); opened to new forms of government by the ideas of Foucault\u2019s \u2018governmentality\u2019 (Faubion and Rabinow 1994) and the 1990s\u2019 promulgation of issue-specific governance regimes that included NSAs (Rosenau 1992); seemingly eroded by the \u2018diffusion\u2019 of power (Guzzini and Neumann 2012); only to be recaptured in the emergence of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) of 2001 (ICISS 2001). On the one hand, myriad regulations and treaties curtail State maneuvering with regard to, among many others, the realm of international health crises through the International Health Regulations (IHR , updated 2005, brought into effect 2007). On the other, adaptations to States\u2019 continued (full) responsibility for the realization of human rights of their citizens continue to put the onus for an ultimate guarantee of human security (\u0160ehovi\u0107 2014) at their doorsteps. This is one side of the emergent challenge. The other is the void of imaginative beyond-State responses to the acceptance, promotion, and protection of the human rights\u2019 realization of non-citizens beyond borders.",

In terms of sovereignty literature, this can be divided into two sets: that which rests on the assumption of State sovereignty and its enduring preeminence capable of withstanding change (Matthews 1997; Philpott 2001; H\u00f6sle 2003; Carlson and Owens 2003; Krasner 1999; Kissinger 2015) and that which assumes that the rise of NSAs in particular presages a State-less, if not stateless, order (Slaughter 2004; Guzzini and Neumann 2012; Risse 2012; Terhalle 2015). It is indisputable that the number and role of NSAs have increased exponentially since especially the end of the Cold War. A mountain of literature has contributed to the understanding of their assumption of responsibilities and potential and modes of accountability. Yet as the case studies, focused on human security vis-\u00e0-vis health and migration, show, the scope and depth of NSA involvement in, for example, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and AIDS response and governance wax and wane. Whether a trend, or a recurring cycle, can be identified remains to be seen. As such, it remains an open question whether the ultimate guarantee of responsibility for human security will rest with States, with NSAs, or with another form of governance.",

Responsibility for human health security takes into account both individual and communal decision-making and their relationship: individual freedom versus communal protection, as seen most glaringly in the debate around vaccination (\u0160ehovi\u0107 2017, forthcoming). As such, health is a unique, local commodity, inextricably tied to communities and States. It is international insofar as its protection depends upon more than one State\u2019s actions. It is also increasingly being framed as global in practice: from the WHO through to the current focus on universal health coverage (UHC) and the Framework Convention for Global Health (FCGH). Health critically depends upon the implementation of systems based in and on State capabilities, notably with regard to services such as maternity care, as well as on surveillance at and across borders, as is the case with transnational threats such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and H5N1 (avian influenza).",
