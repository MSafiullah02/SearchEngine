The kinetics of infection in lymphatic organs and the lung were analysed by immunofluorescence detection of virus antigen, re-isolation of the virus and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for PRRSV-specific RNA. The kinetics of PRRSV infection proceeded in three phases, irrespective of the varying infestation of lymphatic organs within the first days post-infection (p.i.). First, an early acute infection of lymphatic organs developed within the first week and was characterized by a high number of antigen-positive macrophages. Second, a delayed acute infection of the lung was observed, which was most pronounced during the second and third week p.i. when a high number of infected alveolar macrophages was observed. The acute infection of lymphatic organs had resolved at this time. Infected cells in the lung were predominantly located in pneumonic lesions. Third, a persistent infection was demonstrated by RT-PCR and immunohistology when the experiments were terminated at day 49 p.i. The virus persisted in lymphatic organs, especially in the tonsils, and in the lung. At this stage, indications for a re-occurrence of acute infection were observed in restricted areas of the lung.",

In addition, some antigen-positive cells had the appearance of dendritic reticulum cells. In the lung, PRRSV antigen was found in alveolar macrophages. These findings correspond with other studies in which virus antigen was identified by immunohistochemistry in macrophages of the lung and other organs, tingible body macrophages and dendritic cells of lymphatic organs (Magar et al., 1993; Halbur et al., 1994 Halbur et al., , 1996 Larochelle and Magar, 1995; Rossow et al., 1996; Duan et al., 1997b) . Evidence for virus replication within those cell types was also obtained by in situ hybridization (Haynes et al., 1997; Lawson et al., 1997) . Both antigen and RNA of PRRSV was also observed in macrophages of other organs, such as nasal turbinates, heart, liver, kidney, adrenal gland and brain. Macrophages are widely distributed in all organs (mononuclear phagocyte system; Van Furth, 1980) , which makes the systemic character of the PRRSV infection comprehensible. The infection affects especially lymphatic organs and the lung because of the high number of target cells. However, the susceptibility for PRRSV varies among types of macrophages. PRRSV has a strongly restricted tropism for only some subpopulations of porcine monocytes/macrophages (Duan et al., 1997a) .",

They found a high number of antigen-positive cells in all sections from lymph nodes on day 3 p.i., but only in a few sections from lung tissue. However, on day 14 p.i. most regions of the lung were strongly infected and only a few infected cells were found in the lymph nodes and tonsils. In contrast, using the highly virulent American virus isolate VR-2385, a high number of infected alveolar macrophages was already detected on day 3 p.i. (Halbur et al., , 1996 . Obviously the virulence of the strain used for infection correlates with the manifestation of clinical disease and the level of infection.",

Others detected virus in blood until day 23 p.i. (Wills et al., 1997) , day 28 p.i. (Halbur et al., 1996; Duan et al., 1997b) and day 35 p.i. . In our studies, the isolation of infectious virus from the lung and tonsils was successful up to day 28 p.i. Virus-specific RNA was demonstrated on day 49 p.i. especially in the tonsils and the lung. PRRSV antigen-positive cells were found on day 28 p.i. (tonsils, lymph nodes) and on days 35 or 49 p.i. (lung). In the animal necropsied on day 49 p.i. the number of antigen-positive cells in a defined pneumonic region was surprisingly large. In other studies, infectious virus or viral antigen was detected up to 28 days p.i. in lymphatic organs and lung (Halbur et al., 1996) . Duan et al. (1997b) isolated infectious virus 35 days p.i. from lung tissue. Alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage were virus positive up to days 49 or 70 p.i. (Shibata et al., 1997; Mengeling et al., 1995) . Wills et al. (1997) reported that infectious virus was isolated up to 157 days p.i. from oropharyngeal tissue, especially from tonsils. These data indicate that an early acute infection of lymphatic organs and lung is followed by a stage of persistent infection lasting for several months. The virus persists in lymphatic organs, obviously with a predilection for the tonsils, and in alveolar macrophages. Our observations emphasize that an acute inflammatory process can reappear in restricted regions of the lung based on a persistent infection.",

This phase is characterized by a rapid increase in infected macrophages. 2 A delayed acute infection of lung macrophages follows. A small number of macrophages becomes infected at an early point in time. The infection spreads slowly to a peak, which is reached 2-3 weeks p.i. and involves numerous cells. At that time, the acute infection of lymphatic tissues has diminished to only a few cells containing virus antigen. Highly virulent virus isolates reach a peak of infection more rapidly than isolates with moderate or low virulence. 3 A late persistent infection with restricted virus replication lasts several months.

Following oronasal inoculation or natural infection, an initial viraemia develops quickly. This viraemia is probably induced by virus replication in subepithelial macrophages of nasal and pharyngeal mucosa. In addition, macrophages located directly beyond the crypt epithelia of the tonsils could be a major target for infection. The pathogenesis of pneumonic lesions may be initiated by a small number of alveolar macrophages which are infected early during viraemia. The multifocal spread of the virus within the lung supports this conclusion. In addition, the infection may spread directly by the respiratory route. In the following days, more alveolar macrophages are probably infected via viraemia or locally by virus released from already infected macrophages. It is unlikely that blood monocytes are involved in the shift of infection to the lung because they are hardly susceptible (Duan et al., 1997a) .",

The septa are only infiltrated to a small extent by mononuclear cells. Taken together, these criteria are typical for an acute interstitial pneumonia as described for the respiratory form of PRRS (Ohlinger et al., 1991; Pol et al., 1991; Collins et al., 1992; Yoon et al., 1992; Halbur et al., 1993 Halbur et al., , 1995 Rossow et al., 1994 Rossow et al., , 1995 . Numerous antigen-positive alveolar macrophages form clusters and their nuclei show pyknosis and karyorrhexis. A part of these cells might be apoptotic, like in tissue culture after PRRSV infection (Suarez et al., 1996) . We have no evidence that PRRSV can replicate in type II pneumocytes. Therefore, an immediate damage of alveolar cells by the virus infection is unlikely. It is conceivable that the infection and necrosis of alveolar macrophages lead to desquamation of alveolar epithelia and, thus, the production of surfactant could be impaired at an early stage. The repair of alveolar epithelial cells involves proliferation of type II pneumocytes. We suggest that hyperplasia of these cells is caused by an overshooting reaction and a dysregulation associated with the inflammatory process. Further studies will be of interest to elucidate the pathogenetic mechanisms which regulate the cellular responses to pneumonic lesions and local immune reactions.",
