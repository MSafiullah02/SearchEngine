These studies began about 80 years ago and successfully documented the frequency of common respiratory illnesses, which are now recognized to be almost exclusively viral in cause.2\n",

Rhinoviruses are by far the most frequent viral isolate identified in persons with colds. They cause VRIs in all months of the year, but major peaks occur in the fall and in the spring; the fall peak follows the opening of schools. The mechanism of transmission of rhinovirus remains unclear, and the significance of indirect transmission is still under debate. PCR techniques have been able to identify more completely rhinoviruses in studies of persons with suspected VRIs. However, they have not been used in population-based studies, so the actual role of these agents in important syndromes can only be inferred. A particular need for future work is to determine the seasonality of rhinoviruses in areas without a clear winter season and the role of symptoms in predicting which infections are likely caused by rhinovirus. Such determinations will be of value in identifying which patients with respiratory illnesses should be treated when antirhinovirus drugs are available.",
