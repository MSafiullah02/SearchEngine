[1] [2] [3] Antigenically related leptospires of these species are divided into numerous serovars, and related serovars are grouped into serogroups. 1, 4 Leptospiral serovars are maintained in the environment by mammalian reservoir hosts that shed leptospires in the urine. Clinical disease may result when dogs are exposed to organisms by direct contact with infected urine, or indirect transmission may occur by contact with contaminated water or soil. Other less common forms of direct transmission include venereal or transplacental, and through bite wounds or ingestion of infected tissues. 1 The serovars most commonly reported to be associated with disease in dogs are Canicola, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pomona, Bratislava, and Grippotyphosa. 1, 5 The manifestations of leptospirosis in dogs range from subclinical to peracute disease, and infection can result in sudden death, acute renal failure, hepatic disease, vasculitis, or uveitis. 1,2,6 Bivalent bacterin vaccines containing inactivated serovars Icterohaemorrhagiae and Canicola were developed in the 1970s. 7 Over the past 10 years, vaccines containing the additional serovars Pomona and Grippotyphosa have been developed. 8 Definitive diagnosis of leptospirosis can be difficult. Confirmation of the diagnosis may be based on the results of serology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)based assays, fluorescent antibody testing of urine or tissue samples, or organism isolation. 1 Serology does not distinguish between natural exposure and vaccination, although postvaccinal titers are usually low ( 1 : 400) and typically are present for o3 months. 1, 5, [8] [9] [10] A titer of !1 : 800 in a dog with compatible clinical signs and no history of vaccination against leptospirosis often is regarded as supportive of leptospirosis. 1, 2, 5, 10, 11 Because titers of 1 : 1600, or higher, can be detected in the early postvaccination period in some dogs vaccinated against leptospirosis, 8 a cut-off of 1 : 1600 may be used to increase the specificity of a single high-MAT titer for the diagnosis of leptospirosis, particularly if the vaccination history is unknown. A 4-fold change in antibody titer over 2-4 weeks also can be used to confirm the diagnosis. 1,10 Fluorescent antibody testing of urine and culture of the organism are specific but insensitive. 10 Culture of the organisms is particularly challenging because leptospires require specific growth media, and are slow growing. 4, 12 Conventional PCR testing of urine has been shown to be highly sensitive although somewhat less specific for the diagnosis of leptospirosis in dogs. 13 Realtime, or quantitative, PCR is also increasingly used to detect pathogenic leptospires in the blood or urine of humans and dogs. [14] [15] [16] Other diagnostic tests, such as IgM antibody detection by ELISA, have been used in human medicine. 4 The reference method for the serologic diagnosis of leptospirosis is the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). 2, 4, 17 To perform this test, dilutions of the patient's serum are added to suspensions of live leptospiral serovars. The highest dilution of serum in which 50% agglutination of organisms occurs is reported as the titer. 17 The results of the MAT are thought to be serogroup specific. 4 Sera from dogs with leptospirosis commonly react with multiple serogroups, but the serogroup with the highest titer generally is assumed to be the cause of the infection. 1, 2, 5, [18] [19] [20] Cross-reaction is thought to primarily occur during the 1st 6 weeks of disease. 21 Paradoxical reactions have been described in people with leptospirosis, in which the highest initial titer develops against a noninfecting serogroup. 4 This finding is common in people, and can prevent identification of the infecting serogroup from the results of MAT titers alone. A study of culture-positive humans with leptospirosis showed that the MAT correctly predicted the infecting serogroup in only 46% of cases. 22 When followed over time in infected people, cross-reacting titers tend to decrease and the titer to the infecting serogroup usually predominates. 4 In addition, due to the subjective nature of interpretation of the MAT, variations in results among different laboratories and between different observers within the same laboratory may occur. 4, 23, 24 To our knowledge, the utility of the highest MAT titer in predicting the infecting serogroup in dogs has not been directly tested. Also, the variability of the MAT among laboratories or over time in individual dogs has not been investigated. The first objective of this study was to examine the variability in MAT results among different laboratories in dogs recently vaccinated against leptospirosis, and in dogs with clinical leptospirosis. The second objective of the study was to investigate variability over time in MAT results in individual dogs with leptospirosis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 149, "end": 152, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 153, "end": 156, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 157, "end": 160, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 298, "end": 300, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 301, "end": 302, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 895, "end": 897, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1760, "end": 1762, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1763, "end": 1765, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1766, "end": 1769, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1770, "end": 1773, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1774, "end": 1778, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1941, "end": 1943, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1944, "end": 1946, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1947, "end": 1949, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1950, "end": 1953, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2596, "end": 2598, "text": "4,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2885, "end": 2889, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2890, "end": 2894, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2895, "end": 2899, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2999, "end": 3000, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3112, "end": 3114, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 3115, "end": 3117, "text": "4,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3398, "end": 3399, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3571, "end": 3573, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 3574, "end": 3576, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 3577, "end": 3579, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 3580, "end": 3584, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3585, "end": 3589, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3590, "end": 3594, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3675, "end": 3677, "text": "21", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3828, "end": 3829, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4249, "end": 4250, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4444, "end": 4446, "text": "4,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4447, "end": 4450, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 4451, "end": 4453, "text": "24", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The MAT was performed on serum from specific pathogen-free (SPF) dogs, at either 4 or 5 veterinary diagnostic laboratories (VDLs A-E), a-e depending on sample volume obtained.

These observa-tions suggest that MAT titers cannot be relied upon to predict the infecting serogroup in dogs with leptospirosis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Dogs in this study that were vaccinated with a 4-serovar subunit vaccine developed positive MAT titers at all VDLs. These dogs frequently developed the highest titers to nonvaccinal serogroups. This finding has been reported in a previous study in which dogs vaccinated with a subunit vaccine containing serovars Pomona and Grippotyphosa developed the highest MAT titers to serogroup Autumnalis. 8 In our study, we also identified vaccinated dogs that developed highest titers to the nonvaccinal serogroup Bratislava. MAT titers against serogroup Bratislava were not evaluated in the previous study. 8 Our study provides further evidence that leptospirosis subunit vaccines may produce immune responses that are not serogroup specific when measured by the MAT. Another potential explanation is contamination of the antigens in the MAT test with additional serogroups, but this is unlikely because highest titers were found to nonvaccinal serogroups at multiple VDLs. It is also possible that the vaccine used in the study was contaminated with antigens from serogroups Autumnalis and Bratislava, but this is also unlikely given the requirements for vaccine manufacturers to frequently submit type cultures to federal agencies for confirmatory analysis. 8 In dogs with leptospirosis, the serogroup with the highest titer from the MAT has been assumed to represent the infecting serogroup. 2, 5, 18, 19, 25, 26 In a study of 4 dogs experimentally infected with serovar Grippotyphosa, all dogs developed antibodies to the infecting serovar, and 2 developed serologic cross reactions with serogroups Pomona and Bratislava; however, the magnitude of the titers was not reported. 27 Interpretation of the MAT is plagued by cross-reaction among serogroups. In people, the cross-reactions are more common in acute phase samples. Cross-reactions occur because the MAT detects both IgG and IgM antibodies and because leptospires have several common antigens. 4 In addition, paradoxical reactions, where the highest titer develops against a noninfecting serogroup, occur commonly in people, and the MAT has been shown to predict the infecting serogroup in only 46% of people with leptospirosis. 22 In 29.7% of the initial sample MATs and in 20% of the convalescent sample MATs, tied highest titers to multiple serogroups were found. This relatively high percentage of tied results from the MAT also confounds interpretation of the potential infecting serogroup. For the purposes of this study, when 41 serogroup was recorded as having the highest titer, these were considered to be different among VDLs if at least one of the serogroups was different. This approach was chosen because most clinicians will only submit titers to a single VDL. If the results report that the highest titer is against 41 serogroup, it is usually assumed that the infecting serogroup is one of the ones with the highest titer, but it cannot be definitively identified. Thus, a result of the same and highest titers to serogroups Grippotyphosa and Autumnalis could be ascribed to infection with serogroups Grippotyphosa or Autumnalis, whereas a result of the same and highest titers to serogroups Grippotyphosa and Pomona could result from infection with serogroups Grippotyphosa or Pomona. When looking at results from multiple VDLs, as in this study, a different interpretation may be made. For example, for the initial MAT results in dog 14, Grippotyphosa was one of the tied highest serogroups at all of the VDLs to which samples were submitted. Thus, it might be concluded that Grippotyphosa was the infecting serogroup in this case.
