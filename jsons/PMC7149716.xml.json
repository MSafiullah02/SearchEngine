The nature of an outbreak can range from infectious, zoonotic, or chronic diseases to injury, exposure to toxic substances, or health-damaging behavior. The cause can be incidental, accidental, or intentional, as in the case of a bioterrorism attack. Outbreaks require public health investigators to respond quickly and to make reasonable judgments from a dynamically unfolding set of information. Speed, coordination, and informed judgment are critical in these situations, as problems that at first appear limited may actually be significant outbreaks. A variety of approaches to outbreak detection and identification are possible, but the main points to keep in mind are described in the following section.",

Outbreaks are often related to the importation of a case from abroad that acts as a source case for an outbreak (Atkinson, 2007).

One indicator to follow in the measles surveillance system for example is the median interval between onset of rash and notification to the public health authority. This indicator measures the time lost to contain the spread of the infection. This is shown by a measles outbreak that occurred in the United States after a 34-year-old minister with an undocumented history of vaccination became infected while traveling abroad (Rooney et al., 2004). The first symptoms were noticed in 1999 on September 2; the case was diagnosed on September 5 and the health department was informed on September 7.

Once a possible outbreak is detected, a specific diagnosis is required to assess whether an outbreak has occurred. Since 1999, the New York City Department of Health has been monitoring and evaluating emergency medical service calls on a daily basis to identify an increase in respiratory illnesses that might represent an infectious disease outbreak (Mostashari et al., 2003). This is also the recommended method to detect possible intentional outbreaks due to bioterrorism (CDC, 2003). Data sources used often already exist but have not been designed specifically for public health surveillance purposes. An example is the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), which contains coded health information from physician visit records. Data abstracted from emergency department logs or 911 calls can also be used through analysis of text or other developed coding systems (Pavlin et al., 2003). In the case of a chemical agent, unexplained deaths among young or healthy persons or emission of unexplained odors by patients could indicate an outbreak.",

            "text": "Laboratory tests also play an important role. Cases are not always geographically clustered and for that reason are not always easily linked to an outbreak. The CDC and several state health departments established PulseNet, a molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance to facilitate the detection and investigation of foodborne outbreaks (Swaminathan et al., 2001). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns of DNA from bacterial isolates are submitted to the national database and can help link apparently unrelated cases that are geographically dispersed. Though PulseNet can detect clusters of potentially related organisms, epidemiologic assessment is required to determine if the cluster contributes to an outbreak. PulseNet laboratories operate in public health departments in all 50 U.S. states and several national health and agriculture agencies. Most foodborne outbreaks are related to a local contamination such as in a restaurant, but a significant number are due to wide distribution of food contaminated at various points of production. An example is an E. coli O157 outbreak in 1992 linked with contaminated hamburgers that made more than 500 persons sick in 4 days and caused the deaths of four children (CDC, 1993). It took 39 days for the public health system to recognize it as an outbreak and another 10 days to investigate and institute a recall of the contaminated meat. PulseNet can now increase the sensitivity of outbreak detection in many instances. For example, in September 2006, state and CDC officials were able to detect and link multiple small clusters of E. coli O157:H7 infections across the United States within days using PulseNet information. This allowed investigators to rapidly identify fresh spinach as the source of infection (CDC, 2007). More than 200 cases were detected in 26 states and Canada (Figure 4\n).",

This core team should establish a hierarchy for decision and information sharing. They should then create objectives for the investigation and develop plans for reevaluating the objectives as the investigation evolves. It is important to delineate roles and responsibilities for the relevant agencies and to agree on a timeline for reevaluating those roles. A lead agency and principal investigator should be identified. In the case of a large, complex outbreak, the need for additional human resources also has to be discussed.

For weeks the New York Bioterrorism Response Laboratory (BTRL) was overwhelmed by the increasing number of environmental samples. To deal with the situation, a laboratory bioterrorism command center was established and protocols for sample intake, processing, reporting, security, testing, staffing, and quality control were developed (Heller et al., 2002). The specimen load increased from 1 every 2 to 3 months to 2700 nasal swabs in 2 weeks and 3200 environmental specimens in 2 months.

This was done during a multicluster outbreak in Massachusetts.

All the children ate lunch provided by the schools and the disease was characterized by short incubation periods and short durations of illness. Based on prior investigations, a biotoxin or chemical agent was suspected. An environmental investigation identified three distributors who provided the schools with tortillas of different sizes and under various brand names but from one manufacturer. Several deficiencies at the plant were noted such as improper storage, use, and labeling of chemicals, food ingredients and additives, and food contact surfaces were not protected from environmental contamination. Samples were collected and analyzed.

First, all unpasteurized fruit and vegetable juices would have to carry a label stating, \u201cWarning: this product has not been pasteurized and therefore may contain harmful bacteria that can cause serious illness in children, elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems.\u201d The second regulation is the application of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles to fruit and vegetable juice processing (see the section \u2018Relevant Websites\u2019). A HACCP program is a systematic method of identifying key production steps in which contamination may occur and instituting specific monitoring and interventions, such as pasteurization, at those steps.",

Traditionally, the number of cases is depicted on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. The time interval chosen can be months, weeks, days, or hours, depending on the estimated incubation period. Traditionally, the time intervals are one-fourth to one-third of the probable incubation period. An epicurve allows visualization of the epidemic's magnitude and the trend over time, and can predict the end of an epidemic. The curve also helps to estimate the incubation time, which can assist in defining the causative agent. An outbreak with a point source in time and place will give a tight temporal clustering of cases. An example is a norovirus outbreak in the United States linked with a specific restaurant in Eaton County, Michigan, in February 2007. The epicurve shown in Figure 6\nreveals a peak in onset of disease around January 30 and a median incubation time of 32 hours. Investigation showed that more than 360 restaurant patrons became ill after eating in the restaurant on 2 consecutive days (CDC, 2007c). If there is person-to-person transmission, each case can cause more cases, shown on the curve as a series of successive peaks. In 1997, passengers and crew members on a cruise ship developed acute respiratory illnesses possibly due to influenza (Miller et al., 2000). The epicurve of the outbreak among the crew members is shown in Figure 7\n. If the source is intermittent or continues over a long period of time, the curve will show a mix of individual and clustered cases during a relatively protracted time frame.",

A very small p-value means that the chances of finding relative risk due to chance alone are very small.

Often one person will be designated to communicate with the press and public. The content, frequency, and form of communication (e.g., internal meetings, email, press releases, or press conferences) have to be adapted to the target audience. The need to protect the public's health as well as innocent stakeholders who may or may not be responsible for the outbreak must be carefully balanced.
