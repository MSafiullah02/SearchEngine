As also shown in Fig. 1 , the difference between the two methods is independent of leukocyte concentration up to at least 450 \u03eb 10 9 cells/L. White cells, which interfere during spectrophotometric measurement of Hb on automated hematology analyzers, are ultrasonically lysed in the cooximeter of the blood gas analyzer. This together with the turbidity correction on the ABL analyzer (4 ) explains why leukocytosis does not influence Hb measurements on the ABL. The bias between the hemiglobincyanide method and the ABL is independent of Hb concentration and leukocyte count; it thus may be attributable to differences in standardization.",

She was previously admitted in April with fungal peritonitis related to her peritoneal dialysis. Despite antifungal and antibiotic therapy, her respiratory function deteriorated. She became increasingly dyspneic and required supplemental oxygen. High-resolution computer tomography of the thorax revealed progressive bilateral consolidation. On day 5 of admission, she began to vomit, and episodes of four-limb twitching were documented. Within a few hours, she became confused and disorientated. Laboratory investigation showed electrolyte and blood pH values within the appropriate reference intervals and a static urea of 20 mmol/L. Seizures recurred despite phenytoin administration and became prolonged, lasting \u03fe30 min. Oxygen saturation decreased to 40%, requiring immediate resuscitation and intensive care support. She was ventilated and sedated with propofol, and valporate therapy was commenced.",

In this regard, it is interesting to note that coronaviruses have been implicated in demyelinating brain pathology (4 ). Arbour et al. (4 ) documented the presence of the seemingly harmless human respiratory coronavirus OC43 in the brain parenchyma of patients with multiple sclerosis. Murine hepatitis virus, another coronavirus, has been linked to chronic inflammation and demyelination of the central nervous system (5 ) . Therefore, SARS-CoV infection of the brain is a distinct possibility. Our data thus suggest that a severe acute neurologic syndrome might occasionally accompany SARS. Further studies will be needed to demonstrate conclusively that SARS-CoV is indeed causative of neurologic manifestations such as those described here and to address the potential neuropathologic sequelae of SARS-CoV infection of the central nervous system.

The scope of arrayed protein includes peptides, antigens, antibodies, and allergens. In common with the cDNA and oligonucleotide microarrays, a protein microarray facilitates simultaneous multianalyte assays. These analytical devices are now an important tool in studies to characterize the human and other proteomes and for characterizing protein interactions (e.g., protein-protein and protein-DNA). The literature survey has been divided into four sections: (1) General (books, reviews, editorials); (2) Fabrication (array construction and detection methodologies); (3) Applications (protein identification and quantification, array-based proteomics, protein interactions); and (4) To the Editor: The human cytochrome P450 2C (CYP2C) subfamily consists of four members (CYP2C8, -9, -18, and -19), which share \u03fe82% amino acid identity (1 ).
