Factors that contribute to the concern include an increasing number of cases over time, the severity of the illness, and an unknown understanding of the pathophysiology and etiology of the illness. Case Series We cared for three adolescent patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to EVALI. All three patients were treated with high-dose steroids in addition to antimicrobials, which resulted in clinical improvement and resolution of their respiratory failure. Pulmonary function testing was performed on these previously healthy patients both acutely and subacutely. Additionally, we report the results from the laboratory analysis of one vaping device fluid which revealed previously unpublished components within these products. Discussion EVALI is a recent public health concern without a known etiology which can cause life-threatening lung injury in patients without prior lung pathology. We hope these cases will highlight the importance of return precautions in adolescents with vague respiratory symptoms and provide a cautionary tale to providers while they counsel patients regarding the use of these products.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Introduction E-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI) has become a recent alarming public health concern [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Factors that contribute to the concern include an increasing number of cases over time, the severity of the illness, and an unknown understanding of the pathophysiology and etiology of the illness. Although a single etiology and the mechanism of toxicity are not known, patients tend to have a similar clinical course, starting with initial malaise and vague gastrointestinal symptoms, with a subsequent development of cough, dyspnea, and fevers. The patients can develop radiographic findings of bilateral pulmonary opacities [9] , and they can progress to respiratory failure in severe cases. Herein, we report three recent cases of EVALI, all of whom initially reported to an outpatient clinic and were diagnosed with pneumonia, before progressive deterioration required admission to our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). None of the three patients had prior lung pathology. They were treated with highdose steroids, had pulmonary function testing at the day of discharge, and quantitative analysis was completed on one of the products.

During the registered use of this product, it does not behave as a pulmonary toxicant. When heated to over 150\u00b0C, tebuconazole decomposes to hydrogen chloride and multiple nitrogen oxide products (including nitrogen dioxide) [15] [16] [17] [18] . Hydrogen chloride in this setting can produce chlorine gas which should not have delayed pulmonary effects but may explain a fleeting \"burning\" sensation our patient described; though, the product fluid was found to have a lower concentration than is considered a harmful hydrogen chloride concentration in the occupational setting. Nitrogen dioxide is a classic pulmonary toxicant known to produce delayed pulmonary effects including non-cardiac pulmonary edema and ARDS. In acute exposure, it is known to cause fever, anorexia, and lipid peroxidation seen on bronchoalveolar lavage [17] . This can contribute to lipoid pneumonia which has been reported by others [1] . Another nitrogen oxide is nitric oxide which plays an important role in gastrointestinal motility and dysmotility [19] . We propose that pyrolysis and inhalation of tebuconazole might have contributed to the initial burning sensation from chlorine gas, early gastrointestinal symptoms from nitric oxide, and delayed ARDS from nitrogen dioxide.
