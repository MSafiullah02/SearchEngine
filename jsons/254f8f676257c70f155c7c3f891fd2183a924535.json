Guided by the crystal structure and molecular dynamics simulations, we performed systematic mutation analyses to identify residues critical for 3CL pro dimerization and activity in this study. Seven residues on the dimer interface were selected for evaluating their contributions to dimer stability and catalytic activity by biophysical and biochemical methods. These residues are involved in dimerization through hydrogen bonding and broadly located in the N-terminal finger, the a-helix A 0 of domain I, and the oxyanion loop near the S1 substrate-binding subsite in domain II. We revealed that all seven single mutated proteases still have the dimeric species but the monomer-dimer equilibria of these mutants vary from each other, implying that these residues might contribute differently to the dimer stability. Such a conclusion could be further verified by the results that the proteolytic activities of these mutants also decrease to varying degrees.

SARS-CoV involves the largest viral RNA genome known to date, encompassing 29,727 nucleotides predicted to contain 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs) (3) . Two large 5 0 -terminal ORFs, 1a and 1b, encode two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a (around 450 kDa) and pp1ab (around 750 kDa) necessary for viral RNA synthesis. Polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are cleaved extensively by 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) and a papain-like cysteine protease (PL2 pro ) to yield a multi-subunits protein complex called 'viral replicase-transcriptase' (4) .

Each monomer contains three domains: domains I (residues 8-101) and II (residues 102-184) have six-stranded antiparallel b-barrel forming a chymotrypsin fold, the substrate-binding pocket is located in a cleft between these two domains, while domain III (residues 201-303) is an antiparallel globular cluster of five a-helices connecting to domain II by a long loop region (residues 185-200). The 16-residue loop region has been implicated to mediate the substrate-binding (7) . Based on the crystal structure, the N-terminal finger (residues 1-7) might play an important role in both dimerization and enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . Numerous reports have proven that the N-terminal finger contributes well to dimerization of SARS-CoV 3CL pro (8) (9) (10) . In addition, domain III has also been revealed to extensively involve in monomer-monomer interactions (7, 11) . Furthermore, Hsu et al. (9) reported that the residue Arg4 and the last C-terminal helix (residues 293-306) are critical for stabilizing the dimer structure to maintain a correct conformation of the active site. As the crystal structures of different CoV 3CL proteases give similar dimeric structures and nearly all residues of 3CL pro involved in dimerization are conserved, it has been indicated that only the dimer is the biological functional form of SARS-CoV 3CL pro (12, 13) . Tan et al. (14) revealed that the low enzymatic activity of the dissociated monomer is mainly due to the collapse of the oxyanion hole in the S1 substrate-binding subsite. Since the dissociated monomer might be inactive, the dimer interface has been suggested as a potential target for rational inhibitors design against SARS-CoV 3CL pro (7, 15 ).

According to the reported studies mentioned above, the structural integrity of the active site appears to be intrinsically connected with the presence of an intact dimer interface for SARS-CoV 3CL pro . To address this hypothesis, we performed the structure-guided mutagenesis analyses of the protease in this study. Totally seven residues on the dimer interface were selected, including three residues in the N-terminus (Ser1, Phe3, Arg4) ( Fig. 2A) , two residues in the a-helix A 0 of domain I (Ser10, Glu14) (Fig. 2B) , and two residues of the oxyanion loop near the S1 subsite in domain II (Ser139, Phe140) ( Fig. 2A) . These residues are mainly involved in dimerization of SARS-CoV 3CL pro through hydrogen bonding and highly conserved among different CoV 3CL proteases. In the following, we evaluated the effects of these residues on dimer conformational stability and catalytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro using various biochemical and Residue-residue interactions between the N-terminal finger and the S1 subsite in the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV 3CL pro .

It was demonstrated that all seven single point mutated proteases can still form the dimer at varying concentrations, while the monomer-dimer equilibria of these mutants in solution are different from that of the wild type protease. Furthermore the proteolytic activities of these mutants decreased to varying extents compared with the wild type protease. Although the dimer formation of SARS-CoV 3CL pro could not be disrupted completely by single point mutation, individual replacement of these residues by alanine might partly disrupt the integrality of the hydrogen bonding networks on the dimer interface, which perhaps induces an altered conformation of the substrate-binding pocket, therefore, results in the decrease or loss of the enzymatic activity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 22, "end": 25, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 62, "end": 66, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 432, "end": 439, "text": "Fig. 1A", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 890, "end": 898, "text": "Fig. 2A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 960, "end": 969, "text": "(Fig. 2B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1062, "end": 1070, "text": "Fig. 2A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Simulation System-Initial coordinates for SARS-CoV 3CL pro dimer was taken from the crystal structure (6) (PDB code: 1UK2).

Although Ala replacement of single residue on the dimer interface could not completely result in the dimer dissociation in solution, the seven residues we selected still might affect the catalytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro considering their contributions to stabilize the monomer-monomer interface. To verify this prediction, we determined the enzymatic activities of the wild type and seven mutated proteases by a fluorogenic substrate reported previously in our lab (23, 24) .

In detail, mutation of residues Ser10 and Phe140 almost produced the complete loss of the enzymatic activity and the catalytic activities of the Phe3_Ala, Glu14_Ala and Arg4_Ala mutants were also decreased to only 4-10% of that of the wild type protease (Table 4 ).

These selected residues are predicted to involve in dimerization mainly through hydrogen bonding (Table 2 and Fig. 2) . Structurally, the seven mutated proteases could be divided into three groups. The first group includes Ser1_Ala, Phe3_Ala and Arg4_Ala mutants regarding three residues on the N-terminal finger of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . The N-terminal finger of one monomer can form intensive interactions with domain II of the other monomer (6) ( Fig. 2A) , e.g. the NH group of Ser1 in monomer B donates hydrogen bonds to the main-chain carbonyl of Phe140 in monomer A, as well as the sidechain carboxylate of Glu166A; and the side-chain OH group of Ser1B forms a hydrogen bond with the mainchain NH group of Phe140A. In addition, the NH group of Phe3B donates a hydrogen bond to the side-chain OH group of Ser139A. This pair of hydrogen bond might be stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between the sidechain phenyl of Phe3B and the neighbouring residues, e.g. Leu282B and Phe291B. Whereas replacement of residue Ser1 or Phe3 by Ala rendered little influence on the dimer-monomer equilibrium of SARS-CoV 3CL pro (Fig. 5B , C and Table 3 ), indicating that these two residues might not play a vital role in dimerization. The results are in agreement with a reported study that the N-terminal residues1-3 truncated protease still exhibits a tendency to form dimer (9) . The Ser1_Ala mutant maintained 46% of enzymatic activity and the activity of the Phe3_Ala mutant was nearly 10-fold lower than that of the wild type protease ( Table 4 ), implying that in addition to dimerization, residues Ser1 and Phe3 could regulate the catalytic activity of the protease by other mechanisms. According to the crystal structure ( Fig. 2A) , the monomer-monomer interactions mediated by Ser1 and Phe3 might be helpful to maintain the correct catalytic conformation of the S1 subsite, and mutation of Ser1 or Phe3 possibly induces an altered uncompetitive conformation of the S1 subsite. Nevertheless, this hypothesis should be verified by the crystal structures determination of these two mutated proteases. Besides Ser1 and Phe3, another residue Arg4 was also selected for mutagenesis study. The side-chain guanidyl of Arg4 in one monomer forms a salt bridge with the side-chain of Glu290 in the other monomer ( Fig. 2A) , which has been reported as one of the major interactions between the two monomers (12) . Here, Arg4_Ala mutant was shown to a tendency to monomer state (Table 3 ) and a very weak enzymatic activity (Table 4) , further demonstrating the importance of the Arg4-mediated interactions in the quaternary structure and activity of the protease. Although the role of the N-terminal finger has been assessed by many investigations (9, 10), our results revealed that the residues on the N-terminal finger indeed contribute differently to the dimer stability and catalytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1506, "end": 1509, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2536, "end": 2540, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 128, "end": 137, "text": "(Fig. 1A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 237, "end": 245, "text": "(Table 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 250, "end": 257, "text": "Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 586, "end": 594, "text": "Fig. 2A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1256, "end": 1264, "text": "(Fig. 5B", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1273, "end": 1280, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1672, "end": 1679, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1861, "end": 1869, "text": "Fig. 2A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2443, "end": 2451, "text": "Fig. 2A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2606, "end": 2614, "text": "(Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2652, "end": 2661, "text": "(Table 4)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The second group of the mutants is about Ser10_Ala and Glu14_Ala, which are related to two residues on the a-helix A 0 of domain I of SARS-CoV 3CL pro .

Residue Ser10 from each monomer can form a pair of hydrogen bond between the main-chain NH group and the side-chain OH group, and the side-chain carboxylate of Glu14 in one monomer donates a hydrogen bond with the main-chain NH group of Gly11 in the other monomer (Fig. 2B ). In the present study, both of the two mutants were shown to weak dimerization (Fig. 5E-F and Table 3 ) and have no detectable enzyme activity either (Table 4 ), indicating that the a-helix A 0 of domain I might also be a critical region for dimerization. Structurally, the a-helix A 0 (residues Ser10-Gly15) connects to the N-terminal finger of SARS-CoV 3CL pro and might determine the correct spatial orientation of the N-terminal finger (Fig. 2B) . In the dimer structure, the N-terminal finger can squeeze into the space between domain III of its parent monomer and domain II of the neighbouring monomer, which is indispensable for maintaining the correct catalytic conformation of the protease (6, 8) . Mutation of Ser10 or Glu14 to Ala is possible to partly disrupt the structure of the a-helix A 0 and produce a misoriented N-terminal finger, thus making the protease completely inactive.

The oxyanion loop is associated with the formation of the S1 subsite in the substrate-binding pocket, which determines the absolute specificity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro for Glu in the P1 position of the substrate (6, 14) . The oxyanion loop is very flexible and a rearrangement of its correct conformation could induce the collapse of the oxyanion hole (Gly143-Ser144-Cys145) in the S1 subsite, therefore, inactivate the protease completely (14) .

Although Phe140 donated hydrogen bonds to Ser1 through its main-chain groups, the Phe140_Ala mutant still had an obvious trend to the monomer state (Table 3 ).
