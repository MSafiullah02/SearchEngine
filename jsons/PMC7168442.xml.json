An overview on the current taxonomy of picornaviruses pathogenic for humans as well as on newly proposed species of HRV is given in Table I. At present the genus enterovirus includes four approved human enterovirus (HEV) species (HEV\u2010A, \u2010B, \u2010C, and \u2010D) and two approved HRV species (HRV\u2010A and \u2010B) (http://www.picornastudygroup.com/taxa/species/-species.htm). Since 2007, the global distribution of highly divergent HRV strains was reported.2, 3, 4, 5 Based on the results of sequence, genomic, and phylogenetic analyses, it was proposed that these strains represent a new HRV species, HRV\u2010C.2, 3, 4, 6 In 2009, a further proposal concerning a new potential HRV\u2010D species was published after sequencing and analysis of all known HRV genomes.7 The approved and newly proposed species of the genus enterovirus share \u226570% homology (average amino acid identity) in the precapsid protein P1 as well as in 2C and 3CD.3, 7, 8, 9, 10\n",

The conventional term is common cold. The common cold is a heterogeneous group of diseases caused by numerous viruses that belong to several different families e.g. rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, enteroviruses, and adenoviruses.22 But, HRV represent the most common etiological agent worldwide. A large number of distinct strains circulate each year.23 Moreover, in a family or even in a single specimen, multiple HRV serotypes were detected simultaneously.24, 25, 26 By using RT\u2010PCR and culture, it was shown that HRV induce 22\u201350% of upper respiratory tract infections in adults as well as children.27, 28, 29, 30, 31 Higher incidence has been described from September to November,32, 33, 34 and from April to May.33, 34 In some years and perhaps some geographical areas, spring was a more important time for rhinovirus transmission.33, 34 Although overall rates of respiratory illness are lower in summer, rhinoviruses are the most frequently isolated at this time of year.34 The incidence is inversely proportional to age.25, 35 By age 2 years, 91% of the children have antibodies against rhinoviruses.36 In addition to common cold, HRV are also involved in acute otitis media in children.36, 37 Moreover, data supporting a causative association with more severe lower respiratory tract infections of infants, elderly persons, and immunocompromised patients have been accumulated.38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 Studies of childhood and adult asthma have shown that HRV infections can also trigger exacerbations in patients with asthma,46, 47, 48, 49 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 and cystic fibrosis.56, 57, 58 The recently discovered novel rhinovirus genotype HRV\u2010C was associated with community outbreaks of influenza\u2010like, acute upper respiratory infections and severe low respiratory tract infections of infants e.g. febrile wheeze, bronchiolytis, and asthma exacerbations, which peaked in fall and winter.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 26, 59, 60 In addition, the presence of HRV\u2010C in the middle ear in patients with acute otitis media was demonstrated.37\n",

After the deposition of HRV on nasal or conjunctival mucosa, viruses are transported to the posterior nasopharynx by mucociliary action of epithelial cells. Specific receptors on epithelial cells in the adenoid area are used for binding and entry. Already 8\u201310 hr after intranasal inoculation, infectious virus can be detected.76 Virus shedding peaks on the second day after infection and decreases rapidly thereafter.75 But, small amounts of viruses were discovered in nasal secretions for up to 3 weeks after infection. Virus and/or viral RNA were demonstrated in the upper70 as well as lower respiratory tract.45, 72, 77, 78 Using in situ hybridization, Arruda et al. (1995) detected viral RNA in a low number of ciliated cells in nasal biopsies. In the nasopharynx, a small portion of virus\u2010positive ciliated as well as nonciliated cells was positive for viral RNA. In 2000 Papadopoulos et al. provided evidence that HRV may also lytically infect human bronchial epithelial cells in cell culture as well as in experimentally infected volunteers and induce the production of interleukin\u20106, \u20108, and \u201016. In agreement with these results, HRV RNA was detected in 24\u201345% of children and 10\u201318% of adults with pneumonia.79, 80, 81, 82 Taken together, the results of natural cold studies as well as of experimental infection in human volunteers clearly demonstrate that HRV are able to replicate in the upper as well as in the lower airways.",

The mechanism is still incompletely understood because no histopathological changes were observed in nasal biopsy specimens from infected persons.75 This led to the suggestion that clinical symptoms are primarily caused by the inflammatory response of the host to the virus infection and not by the cytopathic effect (CPE) of HRV. Results of immunological investigations suggest a modest correlation between the concentrations of IL\u20106 and IL\u20108 in nasal secretions and the severity of symptoms in upper and lower HRV\u2010induced respiratory tract disease.78, 83 On day 2\u20134 after virus challenge, IL\u20106 and IL\u20108 concentrations were significantly greater in nasal secretions from experimentally infected symptomatic subjects than in those from infected asymptomatic or sham\u2010challenged subjects.

Millions of children and adults are taken ill with common cold every year, need medical consultations, are unable to attend school and go to work.94, 95 Direct costs include hospitalization, medical fees, and symptomatic treatment. Moreover, exacerbations are the major cause of asthma and COPD morbidity, mortality, and health care costs associated with these diseases.92, 93 To date, specific drugs that prevent or reduce rhinovirus infection are not available. Common cold can be treated only symptomatically with analgesics, decongestants, antihistamines, or antitussives and antibiotics are often wrongly prescribed.96, 97 Because of the large number of circulating HRV serotypes, treatment with specific antiviral drugs is considered to be more striking than vaccination. Therefore, the search for new highly active synthetic and/or natural anti\u2010HRV compounds is absolutely essential and represents an important area of antiviral research. Such an anti\u2010HRV drug would have to be (i) with broad spectrum activity because of the high number of HRV serotypes, (ii) administered very early in infection to demonstrate a good antiviral effect because of the fast infection kinetics, (iii) very safe because of the broad application by millions of people, and (iv) directed against a highly conserved target with low risk of resistance development. Due to the very high error rates and the lack of proofreading ability in RNA polymerases of picornaviruses,98 naturally drug\u2010resistant variants may exist in virus populations or resistant viruses can emerge under treatment. As with HIV, another highly variable RNA virus, the risk of resistance development and/or selection of resistant virus variants could be minimized by applying combination of drugs directed against different targets. Because clinical symptoms are suggested to be primarily caused by the inflammatory response of the host to the virus infection mediated by specific cytokines, a further advantage of drug combinations could be an additional immune\u2010suppressive activity.",

A new molecule, named CFY196 demonstrated a better avidity and in vitro potency against HRV over conventional MAbs.161 CFY196 is under development as nasal spray with the name of ColdSol.",

In doing so, capsid\u2010binders induce conformational changes of the canyon of HRV\u20103 and HRV\u201014, hinder virus\u2010receptor interactions, and prevent attachment to host cells.105, 175, 177, 178, 179 In addition, uncoating of both HRV serotypes was shown to be inhibited as a result of a potential loss of flexibility of the viral capsid after drug binding. In contrast to HRV\u20103 and HRV\u201014, capsid\u2010binding compounds did not prevent attachment of HRV\u20101A. Results from X\u2010ray studies showed that drug binding into the hydrophobic pocket of HRV\u20101A replaces the pocket factor but induces only very small conformational changes.180 Therefore, Kim et al. suggested that the observed conformational changes are too small to affect receptor binding. But, capsid\u2010binding compounds prevented attachment of HRV\u201016 possessing a pocket factor like HRV\u20101A without distinct deformation of the pocket.102, 176, 181 Further results from comparative antiviral studies with different capsid\u2010binding compounds and HRV, representative for the major and minor group, did not reveal a correlation between inhibition of adsorption and receptor grouping or antiviral grouping.182 The reasons for the difference in the mode of action of capsid\u2010binding compounds related to attachment inhibition are not fully understood until now. Taken together, inhibition of RNA uncoating was found for all investigated serotypes after drug binding independent of receptor grouping whereas prevention of virus attachment was found to be an additional mode of action for individual viruses and/or drugs.",

One well\u2010described example represents the discovery and optimization of capsid\u2010binders from Sterling Winthrop Pharmaceutical group, the so\u2010called WIN compounds.174 First inhibitors originated from juvenile hormone mimetics that demonstrated some activity against HRV\u20101A. Determination of the X\u2010ray structure of HRV\u201014 helped to understand the compounds' binding sites at the virus capsid.103 Results from subsequent X\u2010ray studies of HRV\u2010WIN compound complexes revealed the location and nature of binding sites and provided information concerning interactions within these sites.175, 179, 180 This knowledge was used for optimization and design of new compounds.199 Optimized WIN compounds, for example disoxaril and pleconaril (Fig. 2), consist of a methylisoxazol ring, a substituted phenoxy group, and a five\u2010membered heteroatom ring and inhibit a broad spectrum of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses (Table II).12, 183, 184, 185 In 1985, the first broad\u2010spectrum WIN compound disoxaril (Win 51711) was tested in clinical trials.139 The development of crystallurea in human volunteers treated with high doses as well as its low bioavailability (15%) prohibited subsequent development. Thereafter, results from SAR and QSAR analysis were used to further enhance the potency and spectrum of activity. In 1992, another compound, WIN 54954, was clinically tested. It was not effective in humans infected with HRV\u201023 and HRV\u201029.153 Moreover, it was rapidly metabolized and induced a reversible hepatitis. Consequently, the further clinical development was stopped. The better understanding of pharmacokinetic properties of capsid binders and synthetic chemistry efforts led to the discovery of pleconaril, an orally bioavailable, well\u2010tolerated capsid\u2010binder that inhibits most rhinovirus as well as various enterovirus serotypes.12, 183, 184, 185 In 2000, Schiff et al. published the efficacy of pleconaril in an experimentally induced coxsackievirus A infection in humans.200 In phase II placebo\u2010controlled, natural cold trials, the drug produced a moderate reduction of 1\u20131.5 day in the medium time to elevation of illness compared with placebo.201 These results were confirmed in two subsequent pivotal studies.202 Besides the moderate clinical efficacy, these studies revealed that 13% of baseline isolates were not susceptible to pleconaril and 11% developed reduced susceptibility (defined as 10\u2010fold increase in baseline value). In a subsequent study the relationship of pleconaril susceptibility and clinical outcomes in the treatment of common cold caused by rhinoviruses was demonstrated.203 Based on drug interaction, marginal treatment effect, and possibility of transmission of resistant viruses, the FDA did not approve the applied oral administration of pleconaril for the treatment of common cold. The molecular mechanism of drug interaction of orally given pleconaril was shown to be based on hepatic cytochrome P450 3A activation.204 To reduce adverse effects, Shering\u2010Plough under license of ViroPharma completed a phase II clinical trial with an intranasal formulation of pleconaril for the potential treatment of common cold in high\u2010risk populations in 2007. The results were not published until now.",

The problem of ester hydrolysis was resolved by the development of oxime ether analogues of pirodavir by Biota. An example is shown in Figure 2.

Because of their pivotal role for viral polyprotein processing and the high conservation of critical amino acids,132 2Apro as well as 3Cpro represent potential anti\u2010HRV targets. Results from cell culture\u2010based assays provided evidence that inhibition of HRV replication is in principle possible. For example, processing of the HRV\u20102 polyprotein was prevented by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate treatment in virus\u2010infected HeLa cells.206 In contrast to other enteroviruses,207, 208, 209, 210 pretreatment of cell monolayers with different nitric oxide donors leading to S\u2010nitrosylation of 2Apro and 3Cpro had neither an effect on virus replication nor on HRV\u2010induced IL\u20108 elaboration.211 The proteolytic activity of 2Apro of HRV\u201014 was specifically inhibited by two elastase\u2010specific inhibitors,212 and an antiviral peptide representing a derivative of the caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk.213, 214 Homophthalimides, e.g. LY353349 (Fig. 3; Table II), were described as inhibitors of 2Apro as well as 3Cpro.215 In contrast to protease 3C, no structure\u2013activity relationship studies have been reported for HRV 2A protease. Moreover, protease 2A accomplishes only one cleavage in HRV polyprotein, while protease 3C performs all other cleavages. After elucidation of the crystal structure of 3Cpro,216 computer modeling of structural features of protease inhibitors became possible.217 Furthermore, structure\u2010based design was used to develop mechanism\u2010based inhibitors of the 3C protease with potent antiviral activity against multiple HRV serotypes.218, 219 Highly active compounds incorporate various Michael acceptor moieties, irreversibly bind to 3Cpro, and exhibit anti\u2010HRV\u201014 activity in HeLa cells.220, 221 Structure\u2013activity studies were performed to optimize protease inhibitors.220, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226 These efforts resulted in the identification of a highly active anti\u2010HRV compound, AG7088 (rupintrivir; Fig. 3; Table II) that entered clinical trials. In cell culture, AG7088 inhibited a broad spectrum of laboratory HRV as well as clinical isolates.132, 183, 227 In a single\u2010cycle, time\u2010of\u2010addition assay it demonstrated antiviral activity when added up to 6 hr after infection.227 Inhibition of HRV replication strongly correlated with reduction in the level of IL\u20106 and IL\u20108 release into cell supernatant, leading to the suggestion that this agent may not only block virus replication but also diminish symptoms.228 The pharmacokinetics and safety of rupintrivir were proved in two double\u2010blind, randomized, placebo\u2010controlled studies.229 Intranasal rupintrivir, administered as single doses of 4 and 8 mg or every 3 hr, six times per day, for 7 days, was safe and well tolerated. Three double blind, placebo\u2010controlled clinical trials were conducted to assess rupintrivir nasal spray (2% solution) for prevention and treatment of experimentally induced rhinovirus colds in healthy volunteers.230 Rupintrivir prophylaxis reduced the proportion of subjects with positive viral culture by 26% and viral titers but did not decrease the frequency of colds. Drug treatment led to the reduction of the mean total daily symptom score by 33%. Subjects receiving rupintrivir also demonstrated significantly lower viral titers and RNA levels than placebo\u2010treated subjects on days 2, 3, and 5 and on days 2 and 3, respectively. There was no influence on the proportion of subjects with positive viral culture and the frequency of colds. Clinical development was terminated because rupintrivir did not act in a subsequent natural infection study in patients.231 In parallel research efforts, an orally bioavailable inhibitor of HRV 3Cpro, i.e. (E)\u2010(S)\u20104\u2010((S)\u20102\u20103\u2010[(5\u2010methyl\u2010isoxazole\u20103\u2010carbonyl)\u2010amino]\u20102\u2010oxo\u20102H\u2010pyridin\u20101\u2010yl\u2010pent\u20104\u2010ynoylamino)\u20105\u2010((S)\u20102\u2010oxo\u2010pyrrolidin\u20103\u2010yl)\u2010pent\u20102\u2010enoic acid ethyl ester (Fig. 3; Table II), was discovered.225, 231 Like rupintrivir, this compound is an irreversible inhibitor incorporating a Michael acceptor moiety that forms a covalent bond with the 3C protease active site cysteine. It demonstrated an antiviral activity against all HRV and related picornaviruses tested.231 In a phase 1 clinical study, compound 1 was shown to be safe and well tolerated. According to a publication of Patick, no further clinical development was planned for this compound.95\n",

It was shown that, rhinoviral RNA can be targeted in a sequence\u2010specific manner by deoxyribozymes,232 morpholino oligomers,233 and small interfering ribonucleic acids.234 The efficacy of the latter two approaches was confirmed in cell culture. In addition, 2\u2010furylmercury chloride (Fig. 4; Table II),235 flavonoids for example 3\u2010methylquercetin (Fig. 5; Table III),236 and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (Fig. 4) interfered with rhinoviral RNA synthesis and inhibited HRV replication in cell culture\u2010based assays.206, 237 The nucleoside analog ribavirin (Fig. 4; Table II) that inhibits a broad spectrum of RNA as well as DNA viruses acts also against HRV\u20102 in HeLa cells.238, 239 The cellular inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase that controls de novo synthesis of purine nucleosides represents the principal target in the mode of action of ribavirin.240 Moreover, when ribavirin is incorporated into picornavirus RNA, it pairs equally well with either uracil or cytosine inducing mutations that can be lethal to RNA viruses.241 Further identified mechanisms of action for ribavirin include inhibition of genomic RNA capping, enhancement of host T\u2010cell\u2010mediated immunity against viral infections through helping to switch the host T\u2010cell phenotype from type 2 to type 1.242 Another compound with potent anti\u2010HRV activity in vitro is enviroxime (Fig. 4; Table II), a benzimidazole derivative.243, 244 It inhibits viral plus strand RNA synthesis.245 In particular the 3A protein, which is involved in the initiation of plus strand RNA synthesis, was implicated as likely target of drug activity.246, 247 However, results from another study suggest that enviroxime targets a complex of proteins and/or cellular factors and that the exact mechanism remains to be studied.248 Although there was a statistically significant reduction in clinical score in a prophylactic study with HRV\u20109\u2010infected volunteers,152 enviroxime failed in experimentally induced HRV\u20104 and HRV\u201039 infection,149, 151 and in clinical studies,248, 249, 250 because of poor bioavailability and side effects. In an attempt to overcome the marked hydrophobicity, water insolubility, and toxicity, Wyde et al. incorporated enviroxime into liposomes and then tested the anti\u2010HRV activity and toxicity of the liposome\u2010incorporated enviroxime in cell culture.251 The liposome preparation of enviroxime inhibited HRV\u20101A and HRV13 as effective as the parent compound and was 10\u2010 to \u226550\u2010fold less toxic. In contrast to free enviroxime, the liposome preparation was readily and successfully delivered by small\u2010particle aerosol to the upper and lower respiratory tract of mice. In another attempt to overcome the disadvantages of enviroxime, several benzimidazole as well as nonbenzimidazole analogs were synthesized and studied.252, 253, 254, 255 Even though some compounds were better bioavailable and could be administered orally,254 none of these compounds was tested in clinical studies.",

Chemically identified substances include polysaccharides and glycoproteins, caffeic acid derivatives (especially cichoric acid and echinacoside), and lipophilic polyacetylenes and alkamides. Pharmacological studies have shown that cichoric acid, alkamides, glycoproteins, and polysaccharides possess immunomodulatory activity. Additionally, alkamides have been reported to exert not only anti\u2010inflammatory effects but also cannabinomimetic properties, which are suggested as molecular mode of action of Echinacea alkamides as immunomodulatory agents.283 Raduner et al. showed that some Echinacea alkamides exert cannabinoid type 2 receptor\u2010dependent and independent immunomodulatory effects on cytokine expression.284 Different Echinacea constituents were evaluated for their anti\u2010oxidative effects measuring the inhibition of in vitro Cu(II)\u2010catalyzed oxidation of human low\u2010density lipoprotein. Thereby, the major caffeic acid derivatives, cichoric acid and echinacoside, showed the highest anti\u2010oxidative effects, which was even higher when combined with a natural mixture of alkamides.285 Sharma et al. used cytokine antibody arrays to investigate the changes in the pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and chemokines released from human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to HRV 14.286 Application of two chemically characterized Echinacea extracts showed a reversion of the stimulated release of numerous pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine\u2010related molecules, e.g. for the cytokine IL\u20106, and the chemokines IL\u20108 and eotaxin. In a similar study, an Echinacea extract rich in polysaccharides and another rich in alkamides and caffeic acid derivatives were as well able to neutralize the effects of HRV\u2010infected epithelial cells.287 Using gene expression analysis both studies revealed the anti\u2010HRV benefit of Echinacea preparations being involved in multiple immune response signaling pathways. Taken together, the numerous pharmacological findings from literature, the potential of Echinacea preparations, and their constituents to combat or prevent common cold can be deduced to immune modulating, anti\u2010inflammatory, and anti\u2010oxidative properties that may also act in some combination of these event, rather than acting directly on HRV.",

At a concentration of 200 \u00b5g/mL Iota\u2010carragenan, a sulphated polysaccharide, was able to fully inhibit virus\u2010induced cell death in HRV\u20102 infected HeLa cells.310 Based on their studies, Grassauer et al. concluded that Iota\u2010carrageenan is effective against different HRV\u2010serotypes on primary human epithelial cells. It is hypothesized by the authors that Iota\u2010carrageenan might create a hostile environment for HRV and thereby block viral entry and replication. Because of its safe application and proved in vitro efficacy, Iota\u2010carrageenan deserves consideration as a candidate for clinical trials for prevention and therapy of HRV\u2010induced common cold.",

The best studied herbal remedy associated with common cold, i.e. Echinacea, showcases the innate problem connected with multi\u2010component mixtures: starting from the late nineties till June 2009 some 100 original articles have been published to this topic and tried to elucidate questions concerning efficacy, molecular mechanism, and bioactive ingredients of Echinacea. Although some evidence is provided for the effects of extracts, chemical classes as well as well\u2010defined constituents on specific targets and pathways, the findings cannot be deduced to a common denominator. Further, results from clinical trials often suffer from lack of comparability, because of using different study designs, outcome measures, and overall the application of different preparations.279 A proper quality analysis and characterization of the preparation under investigation is mandatory and should follow the recommendations and guidelines for reporting clinical trials for herbal medicine.311 As underlined before (Sections 5.1. and 5.2.), the chemical complexity of a natural preparation might be beneficial in terms of synergistic, additive, and overlapping effects caused by the multitude of evolutionary trimmed metabolites, which may attribute with modulating multi\u2010target effects. On the other side, exactly this fact is hardly compatible with the proper assignment of an activity to a defined chemical entity according to Western medical practise. In contrast to a single compound (synthetic or naturally based), the chemistry of a botanical is not only complex but also varying. The analytical profile and in term the pharmacological profile of the investigated samples can differ substantially. Accordingly, the quantitative and qualitative comparison of different studies resulting from botanicals is by far more complex than those performed with pure single compounds, and may also explain why so little emphasis from pharmaceutical industry has been put into the further development of even promising natural preparations.",

A rational criticism of often anecdotal efficacy from traditional medicine is a mandatory attitude to avoid overinterpretation of handed\u2010down information.314 In case of pretended anti\u2010HRV remedies, the reported biological efficacy obviously suffers from being restricted to respiratory diseases, which might be caused by a panel of bacterial or viral infections.

The selection of investigated plant species was mainly based upon their use in the treatment of viral diseases by African traditional healers.320 The antiviral activity of 100 different plant species belonging to 33 families was investigated; thereof 21 species exhibited prominent antiviral properties against one or more of the tested viruses. The most pronounced activity against picornaviruses was recorded within the genus Euphorbia. All compounds detected as antiviral constituents from the respective extracts were identified as 3\u2010methoxyflavone derivatives, especially 3\u2010methylethers of quercetin and kaempferol (Fig. 5; Table III). They showed no significant cytotoxicity and were highly active in tissue culture against all human picornaviruses.

Pharmacophores can be represented by three\u2010dimensional chemical features, which include hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, aromatic rings, hydrophobic groups, as well as positive and negative ionisable moieties. Additionally, the shape of ligands can be represented by shape features, which essentially describe the van der Waals radii of the ligand atoms. The pharmacophore concept has proven to be successful, not only in rationalizing structure\u2013activity relationships but also by its large impact in developing appropriate 3D\u2010tools for efficient virtual screening.336, 354 Steindl et al. elaborated ligand\u2010 and structure\u2010based pharmacophore models implementing the essential feature of the covalent binding to the cysteine 147 in the active site of the HRV\u20102 3C protease. Thus, the in silico approach focused on defining a new pharmacophore feature representing a target structure for nucleophilic addition in the ligands, which is a crucial step for protease inactivation.

The HRV coat protein complexed with its highly active inhibitor WIN 61209 was used as starting point for the generation of structure\u2010based pharmacophore models by Steindl et al. in 2005. The models were used for virtual screening of a large commercially available 3D database. For final selection of virtual hits worth to be subjected to biological testing, docking studies and principal component analysis were performed. Six candidates were tested for their ability to inhibit HRV serotype 39 by multiple\u2010cycle CPE inhibition assay. Although all of them showed a certain antiviral potential, one longitudinal piperazine derivative inhibited the virus at a concentration below 10 \u00b5M. Some of the test candidates showed difficulties in the interpretation of experimental results due to their relatively high cytotoxicity and bad solubility. This circumstance asks for more cautious estimation of molecular properties for compound selection as stated by the authors.356 In a subsequently performed study, the best validated pharmacophore model was used for the identification of naturally derived HRV coat protein inhibitors.144 For virtual screening experiments the in\u2010house generated 3D\u2010database DIOS was used (as described before). Based on the virtually predicted ligands and considering knowledge from traditional use, sesquiterpene umbelliferons from the gum resin of Ferula sp., i.e. asafetida, were finally selected as most promising candidates. For biological evaluation, the antiviral activities of asafetida and its isolated constituents were assessed by an exploratory determination of the inhibition of the CPE induced by HRV serotypes 1A, 2, 14, and 16. The results revealed a dose\u2010dependent and selective anti\u2010HRV activity against serotype 2 for asafetida and its virtually predicted constituents, farnesiferols B and C (Fig. 5; Table III; IC50: 2.6 and 2.5 \u00b5M, respectively). To scrutinize the selectivity of these two compounds against HRV\u20102 in comparison to the other tested serotypes, the amino acid sequences of HRV\u20102 and HRV\u201016 VP1 were aligned. Since all amino acid residues involved in ligand binding showed 100% match in both serotypes, the experimentally determined selectivity profile could not be explained by different binding pockets. The serotype alignment does however not reflect potential protein flexibility during binding, which might differ between the HRV serotypes. Additionally, off\u2010target effects could be a reason for the observed selectivity.",

For this purpose, the Inte:Ligand pharmacophore model collection was used.359 It currently comprises 2.208 models covering 280 unique pharmacological targets. Based on the predicted ligand\u2010target interactions, the authors focused on three biological targets, namely acetylcholinesterase, the HRV coat protein, and the cannabinoid receptor type 2. Virtual hits and nonhits were assayed on their respective targets for a critical evaluation of the performed target\u2010fishing approach. Beside other predicted bioactivities, determination of their CPEs on HRV\u20102 revealed the virtual hit arborinine (Fig. 5; Table III; IC50: 3.2 \u00b5M) and the nonpredicted hit 6,7,8\u2010trimethoxycoumarin (Fig. 5; Table III; IC50: 12.9 \u00b5M) as the most active anti\u2010HRV constituents. It could be shown that the applied in silico strategy has the capacity of catalyzing drug discovery profoundly for all those diseases where molecular targets or molecular ligands are well defined to create reliable pharmacophore models.",

Different concepts have been used as strategy for their discovery either starting from a phenomenological effect, e.g. empirical knowledge from folk medicine, or from a target\u2010based molecular level, e.g. ICAMs, capsid binders, and HRV protease inhibitors. Some of the outcomes revealed potent and promising activities that partly have been evaluated for the management of HRV\u2010induced common colds in clinical trials mainly with sobering benefit. Since the HRV infection is not life\u2010threatening in most cases, a potential therapy has to be safe and effective with an almost unrecognizable level of side effects. These preconditions render the search for anti\u2010HRV\u2010agents into a high challenging endeavor and explains why no antiviral agent is approved for the prevention or treatment of HRV\u2010infection until today, despite the significant efforts. Moreover, the high variability of rhinoviruses suggests the need of more than one active principle covering different modes of action for an effective treatment. Therefore, there is a high need for an ongoing search for new synthetic as well as natural compounds on a molecular level.",
