Though the world has suffered a handful of pandemics during the past century,1 there\u2019s no standardized response; the individualized nature of each contagion presents its threat before the best course of action can be determined. I\u2019m writing this on April 7th, as frontline medical professionals are working around the clock, risking their lives to make great strides. Most of the rest of the population\u2014some physicians included\u2014are now doing our best to work from home, as the world around us has shut down.",

Key highlights include:Learning from nuclear medicine physicians from Wuhan and Singapore on how they curtailed the spread of COVID-19 in their laboratories.Reasons why following local and hospital recommendations is critical.The importance of pre-screening of patients, temperature checks, separation of COVID from non-COVID patients, hand hygiene, laboratory, and ventilation system disinfection procedures\u2014and more\u2014to protect patients and staff.This recorded webinar is available for viewing on the ASNC website.",

A preprint version of this paper2 is available for download from the ASNC website. Key recommendations include:Pre-screen all patientsPostpone all elective and non-urgent procedures (> 95% scheduled procedures are being postponed at most centers)Perform urgent procedures to facilitate short-term patient management including discharge for patients in the emergency room and in the hospital (A tiered approach to indications is provided in the document.)Avoid exercise stress, preferentially perform vasodilator stress imagingPerform protocols that allow for rapid lab throughput: stress first, PET, novel software/novel scanner protocols for short scan duration(3)A recorded webinar on telemedicine and advocacy that discusses key information effecting your practice and billing, including telemedicine, billing requirements for telemedicine, the latest private payer telehealth policies, and Medicare\u2019s newly expanded Accelerated and Advance Payment Program.(4)This has been a challenging time for the practice of nuclear cardiology with postponement of elective testing and redistribution of workforce. ASNC has been working tirelessly advocating on behalf of our members with congress. ASNC joined the American Medical Association (AMA) in a letter to the congress urging all payers to provide coverage for telehealth patient visits, financial support for practices on the frontlines of COVID-19 testing as well as financial support for practices negatively impacted by cancelation of elective visits and procedures. See https://www.asnc.org/news#Private%20Payer%20Coverage%20for%20COVID-19 for this and more advocacy information.(5)ASNC\u2019s new virtual nuclear cardiology elective, held April 6th\u201317th, 2020 via Zoom conference. This offering was created to support both training program directors\u2014suddenly dropped in a flurry of unexpected responsibilities\u2014and their trainees\u2014who remain responsible for completing their educational goals\u2014ensures that radiology, nuclear medicine, and cardiology trainees gain fundamental knowledge from ASNC leaders across the country. The highlights of this novel and extensive 10-day course via Zoom video conferencing include:A daily didactic for 30 min\u201cLive\u201d case reviews for 90 minTeaching by expert nuclear cardiologists and fellows from 5 major medical institutions in the US, andA comprehensive virtual curriculum with:pre-recorded talksguideline documentskey nuclear cardiology papers as pdf filespre-recorded webinars\n",
