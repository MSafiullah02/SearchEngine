Organophosphates are the most common agrochemical poisons followed closely by herbicides. Many agricultural poisons, such as parathion and paraquat are now mixed with a coloring agent such as indigocarmine to prevent their use criminally. In addition, paraquat is fortified with a \"stenching\" agent. Organochlorines have an entirely different mechanism of action. Whereas organophosphates have an anticholinesterase activity, organochlorines act on nerve cells interfering with the transmission of impulses through them. A",

Today, chemicals are used in agriculture for three main purposes: to increase farm production (fertilizers and related chemicals), to kill pests (pesticides), and to preserve farm products (preservatives). Unfortunately, all three classes of chemicals can cause serious poisoning in humans, mainly through improper labeling, storage, or use.",

Out of these, there were 96,112 exposures to pesticides (4% of all exposures) and 10,632 exposures to fertilizers (0.5% of all exposures); a total of 18 fatalities caused by pesticides and one caused by fertilizers were reported. The break-up for 2002 pesticide exposure is shown in Table 2 , and the 18 fatalities caused by pesticides are given in Table 3 . Two categories in which deaths were not reported at all were fungicides and repellants. Most deaths (n = 7) were to the result of insecticides.

The earliest synthesis of an organophosphate, tetraethyl pyrophosphate, was reported by Phillipe de Clermont at a meeting of the French Academy of Sciences in 1854 (21) . Many different organophosphorus compounds were synthesized in the early 1900s, but their toxicity was first recognized by Lange in 1932. Lange stated that inhalation of the vapor of dimethyl or diethyl phosphofluoridate produced a choking sensation and dimness of vision.",

Rarely, there is chromolachryorrhoea (shedding of red or bloody tears) (22) because of a disturbance in porphyrin metabolism and its accumulation in lacrimal glands. LD 50 (lethal dose; the amount of a material, given all at once, which causes the death of 50% of a group of test animals) of these compounds varies from 1 to 50 mg/kg (extreme toxicity) to more than 5000 mg/kg (slight toxicity). Compounds that are extremely toxic are chlorfenvinphos, diazinon, and methyl parathion, whereas those that are slightly toxic are malathion, acephate, and trichlorphon (23) . Most patients who have ingested a fatal dose will die within 24 hours of ingestion. Organophosphorus toxicity has recently been reviewed extensively by Rousseau and co-workers (24).",

Some common carbamates used as insecticides today are aldicarb, carbaryl, \u03b3-benzene hexachloride, triallate, propoxur, methomyl, carbofuran, and carbendazim. Like organophosphates, carbamates are inhibitors of AChE, but instead of phosphorylating, they carbamoylate the serine moiety at the active site. This is a reversible type of binding, and therefore, their toxicity is less severe and of lesser duration (40) . Because they do not penetrate the CNS to any great extent, the CNS toxicity of carbamates is relatively low. Signs and symptoms are the same as those seen in poisoning with organophosphates/organophosphorus insecticides but they are milder in nature. Convulsions are not seen in carbamate poisoning. Postmortem findings in carbamate poisonings are mostly similar to those found in organophosphates.

It was the Swiss Paul Hermann M\u00fcller (1899-1965) who recognized its potential as an effective insecticide. In 1939, DDT was tested successfully against the Colorado potato-beetle by the Swiss government. The United States Department of Agriculture used it successfully in 1943. In January 1944, DDT was used to quash an outbreak of typhus carried by lice in Naples, Italy; this was the first time a winter typhus epidemic could be stopped. So revolutionary was his work that M\u00fcller was awarded with the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1948. It is ironic that just 24 years later, in 1972, DDT was banned in the United States. It is perhaps a unique example in the history of science that a Nobel Prize-winning work was banned within such a short period of time. The main driving force behind this ban was the ecologists' concerns about the persistence of DDT in the environment and its resulting harm to the habitat-humans are equally affected by persistent DDT in the environment. It was Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring, published in 1962, which brought the problem to everyone's notice.",

Bonnet in France found that the Bordeaux mixture, already being used on vines to control powdery mildew, also provided control of specific weeds. By the 1930s, farmers were still using simple chemicals for this purpose; for example, copper sulfate (Blue Vitriol), which was first used for weed control in 1821, was still in use at this time. In the early 20th century, scientists in Europe started using the salts of heavy metals to control weeds but when this was attempted in the United States, the low humidity in the Western states prevented these chemicals from being absorbed by the weeds. Other chemicals were tried, but most of them had drawbacks. For instance, carbon bisulfide used to control thistles and bindweeds smelled like rotten eggs and was, therefore, quite understandably unpopular. Most chemical weed killers of those times (such as sodium arsenate, arsenic trioxide, and sulfuric acid) were highly toxic to humans and had to be used in large quantities (several kilograms per hectare), which was another serious drawback.",

Subcutaneous injection of just 1 mL of Gramoxone has shown to be fatal (51) , with death occuring after 1 to 2 weeks as a result of respiratory failure caused by pulmonary fibrosis; greater doses can kill a human within 24 hours.",

            "text": "Why does paraquat show such remarkable pneumotropism? It has been postulated that inside the pneumocytes, the paraquat dication PQ 2+ accepts one electron from reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and becomes the monocation PQ + . (pyridinyl-free radical) (Fig. 11 ). The monocation PQ + . is unable to cause any injury on its own, but in the presence of molecular oxygen (O 2 ) in the lungs, it is oxidized once again to its dication form (PQ 2+ ). In this process, it passes on its electron to the molecular oxygen (O 2 ), which, in turn, becomes the superoxide anion radical (O 2 -. ). This process, known as redox cycling, is sustained by oxygen in the lungs. The superoxide anion radical O 2 -. (reactive oxygen species) generated as a result of this cycle is responsible for cell death. This also explains why oxygen enhances the toxicity of paraquat and should never be administered during paraquat intoxication; by administering oxygen, one is supplying the \"raw material\" for the formation of the damaging superoxide radical. Formation of free radicals is implicated in injuries caused by at least two other poisons-myocardial injury caused by doxorubicin and liver injury by carbon tetrachloride.",

The oral and esophageal mucosa is reddened and desquamated. A unique feature of paraquat ingestion is the formation of pseudomembranes in the pharynx resembling to that seen in diphtheria (53). Patchy hemorrhages in the stomach mucosa are a frequent finding. The liver is pale, showing fatty changes. The kidneys may exhibit pallor of the cortex. The most striking findings are found in the lungs. Both type 1 and type 2 alveolar epithelial cells accumulate paraquat and are thereby destroyed. This destruction is followed by inflammatory cell infiltration and hemorrhages; fibroblast proliferation then leads to fibrosis and impaired gas exchange. The lungs are congested, appear stiffened, and retain their shape during evisceration. Each lung is typically approx 1000 g or more in weight. Teare (46) reported a case of paraquat poisoning (a 44-year-old man dying of suicidal ingestion of paraquat after 17 days of illness), with the left lung weighing 1980 g and the right lung weighing 1920 g. Blood-stained pleural effusions and fibrinous pleurisy are other typical autopsy findings. Cut surfaces of the lungs reveal edema and fibrosis. Subendocardial hemorrhages may accompany the aforementioned pathological findings. The pathological features of paraquat poisoning have been reviewed in detail by Vadnay and Haraszti (54) .",

AlP dissolves well in water, oil, and fat. It is considered an ideal seed fumigant since the seeds' viability is not affected and is practically free from residual toxic hazards-provided the seeds have less than 20% water content. AlP is minimally absorbed and easily desorbed from the treated commod- ity, such as wheat grains. It is inflammable at the prescribed dosage and devoid of tainting on fumigated stock. It has a distinct odor, which has been described as a fishy odor. Because of this and also because of delays in evolving, phoshine provides considerable safety in handling this fumigant. Safety in handling is due to both these reasons. Because it has an odor, it is difficult for handlers to accidently ingest it. Because the tablet generates the predetermined weight of gas, it is very convenient to administer the exact dose. Cost of fumigation is low and its effects on the fumigated stock last longer. AlP is easy to transport and handle. Unfortunately, no specific antidote to AlP is known.",

They come in an aluminum container containing ten tablets. AlP is also available as 0.6-g pellets. The tablets are composed of pure AlP (the active ingredient) and ammonium carbamate/carbonate (the inert ingredient). The ratio of the active and inert ingredient is generally about 56:44. On contact with moisture, each 3-g tablet evolves about 1 g of phosphine along with carbon dioxide and ammonia, which prevents self-ignition of phosphine gas. This is why it is also called a \"protective gas.\" Carbon dioxide and ammonia are liberated by combination of water with other inert ingredients in the tablets. The main function of the inert ingredients is to produce these gases, so phosphine may not ignite easily. The phosphine gas, once liberated, spreads quickly and kills insects and rodents almost in all stages of their development.

High levels of phosphorus were found in the blood (76.3 mg/L) and liver (8.22 mg/g). Aluminum concentrations were highly elevated in peripheral blood (1.54 mg/L), brain (36 \u03bcg/g), and liver (75 \u03bcg/g) compared with the reference values.",

Corn used for silage is usually grown under conditions of heavy sunlight and drought and its nitrate content is usually very high. When this silage is stored in a silo, the nitrates are fermented into nitrites, which in turn combine with organic acids to form nitrous acid. Nitrous acid decomposes into water and a mixture of nitrogen oxides. These are nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide, and dinitrogen tetroxide. The decomposition starts within approx 4 hours of putting the crops into the silo and continues for about 10 days. When entering these silos (which virtually turn into a kind of gas chamber), farm workers may suffer acute poisoning from these gases, and many such deaths have occurred. This type of death in a silo was first described in 1914, but at that time it was wrongly attributed to asphyxia (111).",

She was found lying dead on the ground outside her house. A thorough autopsy could not determine the cause of her death. A beer can was found next to her, and when it was examined, it was found to contain ammonium sulfate. Subsequently, ammonium and sulfate ions were detected in her serum samples and gastric contents. The cause of her death was determined as poisoning by ammonium sulfate. In order to further confirm that this death was indeed a result of an ammonium sulfate fertilizer, the authors administered a total dose of 1500 mg/kg of ammonium sulfate to three rabbits. The animals developed mydriasis, irregular respiratory rhythms, and local and general convulsions until they came into respiratory failure with cardiac arrest. Electroencephalogram showed slow, suppressive waves and a high-amplitude with a slow wave pattern that is generally observed clinically in hyperammonemia in humans and animals. There was a remarkable increase in the concentration of ammonium ions and inorganic sulfate ions in the animals' serum and blood gas analysis showed severe metabolic acidosis. The authors suggested that when the cause of death can not be clearly determined and the previous history is suggestive of ammonium sulfate intake, measurement of ammonium ions, inorganic ions, and electrolytes in blood, as well as in stomach contents, are a prerequisite for the diagnosis. Villar and co-workers reported poisoning and death in animals who drank fertilizer-contaminated water (117) .

Metaldehyde is a popular molluscicide that can cause fatal poisoning; the 2002 AAPCC annual report (15) mentions as many as 199 cases of exposure to this agent. Kiyota (132) reported the case of a 55-year-old mentally retarded man suffering from pica, who ingested about 2.7 g of metaldehyde. Despite medical treatment, he developed acute lung injury and died after 33 days; he was found to have ascites and splenomegaly. High-performance liquid chromatography revealed 80.6 \u03bcg/mL metaldehyde in the serum. Jones et al. (133) developed a method to detect metaldehyde in samples of stomach contents by gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry for forensic toxicology investigations. A suicide attempt using metaldehyde was reported by Hancock and co-workers (134) . A case of homicide using metaldehyde has been described by Ludin (135) . Detailed overviews of metaldehyde toxicity have been provided earlier by Booze and Oehme (136) and Longstreth and Pierson (137) .",

An example of a synergist is piperonyl butoxide, often used with pyrethrin, pyrethroid insecticides, rotenone, and carbamate-containing pesticides. Piperonyl butoxide is a liver toxicant and a possible human carcinogen (167, 168) ; it also inhibits T-cell activation and function (169) . 3-Chloro-p-toluidine hydrochloride (CPTH) is an aniline derivative registered as a selective, low-volume-use (<45 kg/yr) avicide. Rice baits are treated with CPTH to cause poisoning in birds harmful to crops (172) . CPTH may be mutagenic. Stankowski et al. (173) conducted three in vitro mutagenicity tests of CPTH according to methods recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, e.g., the Ames/Salmonella assay, the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)/hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay, and the CHO chromosome aberration assay. They found that CPTH did not display mutagenic activity using the Ames/Salmonella or CHO/hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase assays. However, CPTH induced statistically significant, concentration-dependent, metabolically activated increases in the proportion of aberrant cells. The authors concluded that the results were suggestive of minimal mutagenicity effects associated with exposure to CPTH (173) . Stahl and co-workers draw attention to the consumption of CPTH treated rice baits by nontargeted bird species, such as pigeon (Columbia livia) and house sparrow (Passer domesticus). CPTH can persist in the breast muscle tissues of both targeted and nontargeted birds which may be a potential secondary hazard to scavengers and predators (174) . Toxicity of CPTH both in humans and animals has been discussed by several other authors as well (175) (176) (177) (178) (179) .",

Poisoning with Azomite was confirmed when aramite and azoxybenzene, two effective components of Azomite emulsion, were detected in the patient's serum when qualitatively analyzed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

These could sometimes be more toxic than the active ingredient. Rubbiani drew attention to several of these adjuvants and clinical syndromes produced by them (182) . According to Harry (4) , toxicity is often due to solvents or surfactants included in the composition of a formula used as an agricultural chemical. When the obligatory declaration on the label about identity and concentration of some of these substances is not provided by the actual legislation in a particular country, the problem becomes more acute. It is also often difficult to determine if the cause of the poisoning is the actual agricultural chemical itself or its adjuvants.",

She purchased Gramoxone along with her friend Olive Hemming (who turned out to be the chief prosecution witness) from a farm shop, and most likely administered it to her husband in repeated small doses. Kenyon was taken ill on November 18, 1973 and died 13 days later, on December 1. During his illness, he displayed all the classical symptoms and signs of paraquat poisoning. Postmortem examination confirmed death by paraquat intoxication. Mrs. Kenyon was convicted of murder, whereas David Roberts was acquitted because of lack of evidence against him (195) . The second case occurred only 1 month later. After Christmas 1973, on the Falkland Islands, four local agricultural workers had been having a Boxing Day party when some Gramoxone was slipped for some unknown reason into one of their beers. The man died after displaying typical symptoms of paraquat poisoning. Autopsy confirmed poisoning by paraquat. Criminal charges against the other three laborers were contemplated, but eventually it was decided to drop them.",

            "text": "Stephens and Moormeister from the Medical Examiner's Office of San Francisco, CA, reported four cases of homicidal poisoning by paraquat (194) . Of these, the first three murders were perpetrated by one man against members of his immediate family, and the fourth case was equivocal-it could either have been suicide or homicide. The first three murders were committed by a man who had been married five times. His first three wives were alive and healthy. When the fourth wife threatened to divorce him, she found herself ill and died 24 days after the onset of her illness (19 days after hospitalization). Eight years later, when his fifth wife threatened divorce, she suffered the same fate, and a few months later, his 79-year-old mother also died. All three showed typical symptoms of paraquat poisoning. The postmortem findings seemed to suggest natural disease of the lungs. Although a suggestion of paraquat poisoning was made in all three cases, the concerned pathologist was reluctant to sign death certificates as paraquat poisoning. Toxicological analysis in the second and third cases revealed the presence of paraquat in the victims' tissues and this resulted in conviction of the murderer. It was found that the defendant worked as a mechanic on a large agricultural ranch and had easy access to paraquat; his thumb print was found on one of the opened paraquat containers, although he had earlier denied having to do anything with those containers. The fourth case involved a 27-year-old man, a registered herbicide and pesticide user, who had marital difficulties with his aggressive, \"shrew-like\" wife who also stood to benefit from a large insurance policy upon his death. While in hospital, the victim denied suicidal ingestion; he died 21 days after the start of his illness. No testing of toxic effects from the compounds he worked with was ever performed, nor was any consideration given to this possibility. The case did not result in court charges for anyone. Stephens and Moormeister concluded that the reason why such cases will often go unnoticed is because of the reluctance on the part of both clinicians and forensic pathologists to even think in the direction of paraquat poisoning when they see such a clear and typical picture of \"viral pneumonia.\" In their opinion, the clinician should suspect paraquat ingestion in all cases in which there is progressive pulmonary involvement with no features of viral infection (194) . The pathologist conducting the postmortem would do well to go through the clinical history, if available, in detail to rule out the possibility of paraquat poisoning. In all doubtful cases, a full toxicological analysis should be done and the tissues should be particularly analyzed for paraquat.",
