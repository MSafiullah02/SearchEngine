Two-thirds of their RNA has viral polymerase (RdRp), RNA synthesis materials and two large non-structural polyproteins that are not involved in host response modulation (ORF1a-ORF1b) (Jordan et al. 2018) . One-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), as well as other helper proteins (Lu et al. 2020; Paraskevis et al. 2020) . Even though the length of the CoV genome showed high variability for ORF1a/ORF1b and four structural proteins (Jordan et al. 2018; Paraskevis et al. 2020) , it is mostly associated with the number and size of accessory proteins (Cui et al. 2019; Tortorici et al. 2019 ). The first step in virus infection was the interaction of sensitive human cells with S protein Cao et al. 2020) . Genome encoding occurs after entering the cell and facilitates the expression of the genes (Cui et al. 2019) , which encode useful accessory proteins , and these advance the adaptation of CoVs to their human host (Lu et al. 2020) . Genome changes resulting from recombination, gene exchange, gene insertion or deletion have been frequent among CoVs, and this will take place in future outbreaks as well (Paraskevis et al. 2020) . The CoV subfamily is rapidly expanding with new generation sequencing applications that Pathogenesis SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV attach to the host cell respectively bind to cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (SARS-CoV associated) and cellular receptor of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (MERS-CoV associated) Park et al. 2019; Letko et al. 2020) . The viral RNA replicates in the cytoplasm after entering the cell (Letko et al. 2020 ). Genomic RNA is encapsulated and polyadenylated, and it encodes various structural and non-structural polypeptide genes (Cui et al. 2019; Subissi et al. 2014 ). These polyproteins are split by proteases that exhibit chymotrypsin-like activity (Subissi et al. 2014; Goo et al. 2020) . The resulting complex drives (\u2212) RNA production through both replication and transcription (Jordan et al. 2018) . During replication, full-length (\u2212) RNA copies of the genome are produced and used as a template for full-length (+) RNA genomes (Cui et al. 2019; Jordan et al. 2018) . During transcription, a subset of 7-9 subgenomic RNAs, including those encoding all structural proteins, are produced by discontinuous transcription (Cui et al. 2019; Jordan et al. 2018 ). Viral nucleocapsids are combined from genomic RNA and R protein in the cytoplasm and then are budded into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (Cui et al. 2019) . Virions are then released from the infected cell through exocytosis (Cui et al. 2019 ). The released viruses can infect kidney cells, liver cells, the intestines and T lymphocytes, as well as the lower respiratory tract, where they cause the main symptoms and signs. Remarkably, CDT lymphocytes were found to be < 200 cells/mm3 in three patients with SARS-CoV infection (Cui et al. 2019; Luk et al. 2019; Paraskevis et al. 2020) . MERS-CoV can affect human dendritic cells, macrophages and T lymphocytes. This virus can make the antiviral T cell response irregular because of the stimulation of T cell apoptosis, thus causing a collapse of the immune system (Farooq et al. 2020; Park et al. 2019; Goo et al. 2020; Cockrell et al. 2016 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 63, "end": 80, "text": "(Woo et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 266, "end": 286, "text": "(Jordan et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 440, "end": 456, "text": "(Lu et al. 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 457, "end": 480, "text": "Paraskevis et al. 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 593, "end": 613, "text": "(Jordan et al. 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 614, "end": 637, "text": "Paraskevis et al. 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 711, "end": 728, "text": "(Cui et al. 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 729, "end": 750, "text": "Tortorici et al. 2019", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 848, "end": 864, "text": "Cao et al. 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 958, "end": 975, "text": "(Cui et al. 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1096, "text": "(Lu et al. 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1270, "end": 1294, "text": "(Paraskevis et al. 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1607, "end": 1624, "text": "Park et al. 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1643, "text": "Letko et al. 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1712, "end": 1730, "text": "(Letko et al. 2020", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1853, "end": 1870, "text": "(Cui et al. 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1871, "end": 1890, "text": "Subissi et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1976, "end": 1997, "text": "(Subissi et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1998, "end": 2014, "text": "Goo et al. 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2108, "end": 2128, "text": "(Jordan et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2260, "end": 2277, "text": "(Cui et al. 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2278, "end": 2297, "text": "Jordan et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2449, "end": 2466, "text": "(Cui et al. 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2467, "end": 2485, "text": "Jordan et al. 2018", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2634, "end": 2651, "text": "(Cui et al. 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2722, "end": 2738, "text": "(Cui et al. 2019", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3024, "end": 3041, "text": "(Cui et al. 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3042, "end": 3058, "text": "Luk et al. 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3059, "end": 3082, "text": "Paraskevis et al. 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3312, "end": 3332, "text": "(Farooq et al. 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3333, "end": 3350, "text": "Park et al. 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3351, "end": 3367, "text": "Goo et al. 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3368, "end": 3388, "text": "Cockrell et al. 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virus genome and structure"}, {"text": "In December 2019, many pneumonia cases clustered in Wuhan were reported, and a search determined the source to be the Huanan seafood market (Chan et al. 2020 ). The first patient of the COVID-19 epidemic was discovered with unexplained pneumonia on December 12, 2019, and 27 viral pneumonia cases, 7 severe, were officially made known on December 31, 2019 (Zhu et al. 2020; Tang et al. 2020a ). Etiologic investigations were made into patients who applied to the hospital for similar viral pneumonia findings (Chen et al. 2020) . The natural history of high-risk animal contact in the medical histories of these patients has strengthened the likelihood of an infection transmitted from animals to humans (Wu et al. 2020a; Zhou et al. 2020 ). On January 22, 2020, novel CoVs were confirmed to originate from wild bats and belong to Group 2 of the beta-coronaviruses, which includes severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Paraskevis et al. 2020) . Although COVID-19 and SARS-CoV belonged to the same beta coronavirus subgroup, genome-level similarities were only 70%, because the novel group has been found to show genetic differences from SARS-CoV (Lu et al. 2020; Paraskevis et al. 2020 ). The outbreak of the SARS epidemic and COVID-19 occurred during the Spring Festival in China (SFC), the country's most famous traditional festival, during which nearly 3 billion people travel countrywide (Chen et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020a ). These situations caused ideal conditions for the transmission of this highly contagious disease and severe difficulties in prevention and control of the epidemic (Read et al. 2020 (Cui et al. 2019; Yin and Wunderink 2018) . Conversely, more advanced virologic and genetic studies have shown that bats are reservoir hosts of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Yin and Wunderink 2018) , and before these viruses spread to humans (Cui et al. 2019) , they use the other animals as intermediate hosts. Studies have reported that most of the bat CoVs are the gene source of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, whereas most of the bird CoVs are the gene source of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs . Recent studies have shown that the novel virus causing epidemics coincides with the CoV isolated in bats (Wu et al. 2020a; Zhou et al. 2020; Drexler et al. 2010) .
