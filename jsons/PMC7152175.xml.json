Airway obstruction often worsens when infants and children are alarmed during a diagnostic evaluation. Humidified oxygen should be administered through a nasal cannula or facemask. These devices may frighten younger children who may more readily accept oxygen delivered through flexible tubing held by the parent. If the child will tolerate placement of a pulse oximeter probe, this provides a noninvasive way of evaluating oxygenation. If oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter measurement is within an acceptable range (>95%), arterial blood gas determination may be unnecessary. An arterial blood gas is useful to identify the patient who may be hypercapnic, but to obtain these data may further upset the child.",

Depending on the patient\u2019s condition, the degree of respiratory embarrassment may be quantified with a rating scale (Table 44-1\n). One of the primary benefits of using such a scale is that signs of respiratory obstruction are systematically sought and objectively documented. This information may be valuable in helping to define the course of the patient\u2019s illness and the response to treatment. During the initial evaluation, an assessment may be made regarding the likely location of the obstruction. Extrathoracic airway obstruction usually results in stridor (the obstruction is most severe during inspiratory phase), while intrathoracic airway obstruction usually results in wheezing (the obstruction is most severe during expiratory phase). Localizing the obstruction in this manner helps to narrow the diagnostic possibilities.",

            "text": "Choanal atresia is estimated to occur about once in every 5000 to 9000 live births.4 Choanal atresia is seen commonly with other defects, especially CHARGE syndrome, which accounts for 25% of all patients with choanal stenosis.5 Unilateral choanal atresia, the most common form, is often seen without accompanying congenital defects and may not be diagnosed at the time of delivery. Bilateral choanal atresia almost always occurs in the presence of other congenital defects.5 For the first 5 months of life, many infants breathe only through their noses and do not open their mouths when the nasal passages are occluded; consequently, bilateral choanal atresia often results in respiratory distress shortly after birth. Bilateral choanal atresia (Figure 44-1\n) is diagnosed through examination of the naris with the mouth closed. If no airflow is present, a presumptive diagnosis of choanal atresia is established. Some authorities advocate passing a thin, flexible catheter through the naris. This will confirm the diagnosis of choanal atresia; however, if the symptoms are resulting from choanal stenosis, edema formation following even minor trauma of the nasal mucosa after catheter placement may lead to complete occlusion of the nasal airway and worsening of respiratory distress. Surgery is indicated for the correction of bilateral choanal atresia if the infant has symptoms6 (Figure 44-2\n). Infants with bilateral choanal atresia generally have surgery within the first 3 months of life, while infants with unilateral choanal atresia typically have surgery after the second year of life.7 Topical application of mitomycin to inhibit fibroblast proliferation has been shown to be an effective adjunct to surgical repair of choanal atresia.8 Although choanal atresia is the most common cause of nasal airway obstruction, midline nasal masses such as meningoencephaloceles, gliomas, or dermoid tumors can also cause obstruction. Because these lesions may originate from within the cranial vault, computed tomography (CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed before a biopsy or surgical correction of the abnormality is attempted.9\n",

Although the diagnosis of laryngotracheal stenosis may be made radiographically, it is usually established with bronchoscopy.

Vascular rings and enlarged pulmonary arteries are also known to cause tracheal compression, as are a variety of other vascular abnormalities.21 These lesions may present with physical findings such as stridor or wheezing. Alternatively, the patient may be symptom-free, but may suffer respiratory problems such as recurrent lobar atelectasis or frequent pulmonary infections. Because of this, it is difficult to recognize a vascular ring as the underlying cause of illness.22 Careful inspection of the chest radiograph may reveal indentation of the trachea, but often this sign is absent. Barium swallow has been the historic method of diagnosing vascular impingement of the trachea. CT scanning and MRI have become the diagnostic modalities of choice (Figure 44\u20136, Figure 44\u20137\n).23., 24. These noninvasive methods are effective at showing complex three-dimensional cardiovascular anatomy, especially the extracardiac morphology. Treatment involves surgical correction of the vascular anomaly, in severe cases.

Characteristically, intrathoracic cartilaginous lesions such as bronchomalacia or tracheomalacia impede exhalation. Diagnosis of this problem may be made through observation of collapse of the upper airways during active exhalation, such as occurs while crying.

There is frequently a history of prodromal infection accompanied by an unusual cough (described as sounding like the bark of a seal). Swelling of the tracheal mucosa in the subglottic region causes airway compromise (Figure 44-8\n). Medical attention is usually sought when the child develops inspiratory stridor and respiratory distress. Various scales have been devised to quantify the severity of the stridor to document the progression of the illness and the response to therapy. One of the most commonly employed scales is the Westley scale,34 which has been validated (see Table 44-1).35\n",

When a child with presumed epiglottitis is admitted to the emergency department, this team should be notified in anticipation of taking the child to the operating room to secure his or her airway. As the team members are being notified, lateral radiographs of the neck may be obtained if tolerated by the patient. This may be done with the child sitting on the parent\u2019s lap to minimize the child\u2019s anxiety. In epiglottitis, the anteroposterior view of the trachea appears normal, but a lateral neck radiograph shows a markedly swollen and edematous epiglottis (Figure 44-10\n). The diagnostic evaluation of the patient should proceed expeditiously, while care is taken to disturb the patient as little as possible. For this reason, fiberoptic examination of the epiglottis in the awake patient is usually not advisable. Attempts to examine the oropharynx directly or to start an intravenous line should be discouraged. The apprehension caused by these events may lead to tracheal obstruction by the enlarged epiglottis. If the patient will tolerate it, humidified oxygen should be administered, preferably through a plastic hose held by the parent.",

In the operating room, the patient is anesthetized with an inhaled anesthetic (sevoflurane) and oxygen while the patient is spontaneously breathing. Once the patient has been anesthetized, an intravenous catheter is inserted. Laryngoscopy is then performed (Figure 44-11\n). It may be exceedingly difficult to obtain a direct view of the glottis and trachea because of the large swollen epiglottis. Nevertheless, it is almost always possible to pass an endotracheal tube through the edematous tissues and into the trachea. Nasotracheal intubation is preferred to orotracheal intubation because the tube is more readily secured to the face, the patient cannot bite the tube, and salivation is decreased. An otolaryngologist should be in the operating room and ready to do an emergency tracheostomy if an airway cannot be secured by endotracheal intubation, although this is rarely necessary. As with laryngotracheobronchitis, endotracheal intubation is preferred to tracheostomy because it has been shown that complications are more common when a tracheostomy has been routinely used to treat epiglottitis. After the airway is secured, blood cultures and cultures of the epiglottis are obtained, and antibiotic therapy is initiated with a penicillinase-resistant antibiotic because of the high incidence of H. influenzae resistance to ampicillin.53\n",

Endotracheal tube size plays an important role, because too large an endotracheal tube may compress the tracheal mucosa, causing submucosal ischemia. When the endotracheal tube is removed, the injured tissue may swell and partially obstruct the larynx. Endotracheal tube movement within the trachea may produce trauma to the tracheal mucosa, resulting in tissue injury and swelling. Whether stridor occurs depends on the extent of the swelling and the diameter of the child\u2019s airway. Small patients are more likely to have postextubation stridor because a larger proportion of their airway is obstructed with a given degree of swelling and because of the unfavorable characteristics of turbulent flow through small passages. Lack of an audible leak of air around the endotracheal tube is frequently used as a predictor of postextubation stridor in children; however, one study suggests that this measure may be valid only in children ages 7 years and older.92\n",

The subglottic region is the narrowest portion of the airway in this age group and will often provide an adequate seal around the endotracheal tube. Although historically, cuffed endotracheal tubes were not frequently used in children younger than 8 years, there are increasing data suggesting the safety of such endotracheal tubes. Data regarding the harmful effects of cuffed endotracheal tubes were derived from tubes with high-pressure, low-volume cuffs, which are likely to cause submucosal tracheal ischemia. These endotracheal tubes have been replaced by low-pressure, high-volume cuffs that seal the trachea by providing a larger area of contact with the mucosa at a lower pressure, resulting in less submucosal ischemia. When such endotracheal tubes are used, the risk of postextubation stridor appears no greater than when uncuffed endotracheal tubes are used.88., 89., 93. Because cuffed endotracheal tubes may provide a better seal than uncuffed endotracheal tubes, they can be useful in delivering higher pressures needed in patients with noncompliant lungs who require mechanical ventilation. A large multicenter randomized control trial also suggests there is a significant reduction in endotracheal tube exchanges when cuffed tubes are used.88\n",

This region cannot expand under pressure and is thus more susceptible to pressure necrosis and scarring (subglottic stenosis). Airway stenosis also can occur at the level of the vocal cords (glottic stenosis) when scarring occurs within the cricoarytenoid joints (cricoarytenoid ankylosis) or between the arytenoid cartilages (interarytenoid fibrosis). Glottic stenosis prevents vocal cord abduction and occasionally may be confused with bilateral vocal cord paralysis.

Compared to adults, children often have a rapid response to antihistamines and steroids.113 Occasionally, respiratory embarrassment caused by this condition is so severe that endotracheal intubation is warranted. The evaluation of patients with this disorder should be directed at (1) the identification of the causative agents so that the patients can avoid these in the future and (2) the anatomic site of presentation to allow stratification of airway risk and planning of appropriate triage for airway intervention.114\n",

Until a tract of granulation tissue has formed in the stoma between the cervical and tracheal epithelium, precautions should be taken to prevent the accidental displacement of the tracheostomy tube. Although stay sutures simplify replacement of the tracheostomy tube, this procedure may be difficult, especially in an emergency situation with a struggling patient. A hastily replaced tube may be incorrectly located in the pretracheal soft tissue, resulting in asphyxiation. If positive-pressure ventilation is attempted with the tube in this position, subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema may be followed by a life-threatening tension pneumothorax. Because of these risks, patients routinely stay in the ICU for 5 to 7 days postoperatively. Smaller children have arm restraints placed to prevent them from pulling at the tracheostomy tube. If necessary, sedation is given until the child grows accustomed to the tracheostomy and the tract matures with the formation of granulation tissue. If accidental displacement of the tracheostomy tube does occur, replacement may be facilitated with a gentle insertion of a 0 Miller laryngoscope blade into the stoma and the identification of the tracheal lumen before the tube is passed.",
