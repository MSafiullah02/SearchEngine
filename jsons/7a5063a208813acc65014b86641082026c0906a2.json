For example, pneumonia is a clinical diagnosis of lung infection that may be caused by viral, bacterial, fungal, or other pathogens. The study of pneumonia etiology is challenging because directly sampling from the lung to identify the etiologic pathogen is not standard clinical practice in most settings. Instead, measurements from multiple peripheral specimens are made. This paper introduces the statistical methodology designed for estimating the population etiology distribution and the individual etiology probabilities in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study of 9, 500 children for 7 sites around the world. We formulate the scientific problem in statistical terms as estimating the mixing weights and latent class indicators under a partially-latent class model (pLCM) that combines heterogeneous measurements with different error rates obtained from a case-control study. We introduce the pLCM as an extension of the latent class model. We also introduce graphical displays of the population data and inferred latent-class frequencies. The methods are tested with simulated data, and then applied to PERCH data. The paper closes with a brief description of extensions of the pLCM to the regression setting and to the case where conditional independence among the measures is relaxed.",

The known pneumonia status (case-control) is directly caused by the presence or absence of a pathogen-caused infection in the lung. For controls, the lung is known to be sterile and has no infection. For a child clinically diagnosed with pneumonia, the pathogen causes the infection in a child's lung is the scientific target of interest. Among the candidate pathogens being tested, we assume only one is the primary cause. Extensions to multiple pathogens are straightforward. Because, for most cases, it is not possible to directly sample the lung, we do not know with certainty which pathogen infected the lung, so we seek to infer the infection status based upon a series of laboratory measurements of specimens from various body fluids and body sources.",

For this application, it is convenient to categorize measures into three subgroups referred to as \"gold\", \"silver\", and \"bronze\" standard measurements. A gold-standard (GS) measurement is assumed to have both perfect sensitivity and specificity. Lung aspirate data would have been gold-standard. A silver-standard (SS) measurement is assumed to have perfect specificity, but imperfect sensitivity. Culturing bacteria from blood samples (B-cX) is an example of silver-standard measurements in PERCH.

Albert and Dodd (2008) studied a model where some subjects are selected to verify their latent status (i.e. collect GS measurements) with the probability of verification either depending on the previous test results or being completely at random. They showed GS data can make model estimates more robust to model misspecifications. We further quantify how much GS data reduces the variance of model parameter estimates for design purposes. Also, they considered binary latent status and did not have available control data. Another related literature that uses both GS and BrS data is on verbal autopsy (VA) in the setting where no complete vital registry system is established in the community (King and Lu, 2008) . Quite similar to the goal of inferring pneumonia etiology from lab measurements, the VA goal is to infer the cause of death from a pre-specified list by asking close family members questions about the presence/absence of several symptoms. King and Lu (2008) proposed estimating the cause-of-death distribution in a community using data on dichotomous symptoms and GS data from the hospital where cause-of-death and symptoms are both recorded. However, their method involves nonparametric and requires a sizable sample of GS data, especially when the number of symptoms is large. In addition, a key difference between VA and most infectious disease etiology studies is that the VA studies are by definition case-only.",

We focus on three states to facilitate viewing of the \u03c0 estimates and individual predictions in the 3-dimensional simplex S 2 . We use the ternary diagram (Aitchison, 1986) representation where the vector \u03c0 = (\u03c0 A , \u03c0 B , \u03c0 C ) is encoded as a point with each component being the perpendicular distance to one of the three sides. The parameters involved are fixed at TPR = \u03b8 = (\u03b8 A , \u03b8 B , \u03b8 C ) = (0.9, 0.9, 0.9) , FPR = \u03c8 = (\u03c8 A , \u03c8 B , \u03c8 C ) = (0.6, 0.02, 0.05) , and \u03c0 = (\u03c0 A , \u03c0 B , \u03c0 C ) = (0.67, 0.26, 0.07) .",

First, because the control subjects have known class, we can model the dependence structure among the BrS measurements and use this to avoid aspects of the conditional independence assumption central to most LCM methods. The approach is to extend the pLCM to have K subclasses within each of the current disease classes. These subclasses can introduce correlation among the BrS measurements given the true disease state. An interesting question is about the bias-variance trade-off for different values of K. This ideas follows previous work on the PARAFAC decomposition of probability distribution for multivariate categorical data (Dunson and Xing, 2009) . This extension will enable model-based checking of the standard pLCM.",

The closed curves are 95% credible regions for analysis using BrS data only (blue dashed lines \"---\"), BrS+GS data (light green solid lines \"-\"), GS data only (textitblack dotted lines \"\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \"); Solid square/dot/triangle are the corresponding posterior means of \u03c0; The 95% highest density region of uniform prior distribution is also visualized by red \"\u00b7 \u2212 \u00b7\u2212\" for comparison. In(c) or (d), 8(= 2 3 ) BrS measurement patterns and predictions for individual children are shown with measurement patterns attached. The numbers at the vertices show empirical frequencies of GS measurements. The observed BrS rates (with 95% confidence intervals) for cases and controls are shown on the far left. The conditional odds ratio given the other pathogens is listed with 95% confidence interval in the box to the right of the BrS data summary. In the left box, below the case and control observed rates is a horizontal line with a triangle. The line starts on the left at the model estimated false positive rate (FPR,\u03c8 BrS j ) and ends on the right at the estimated true positive rate (TPR,\u03b8 BrS j ). Below the TPR are two boxplots summarizing its posterior (top) and prior (bottom) distributions. The location of the triangle, expressed as a fraction of the distance from the estimated FPR to the TPR, is the point estimate of the etiologic fraction for each pathogen. The SS data are shown in a similar fashion to the right of the BrS data using support intervals rather than boxplots. Summary of posterior distribution of pneumonia etiology estimates. Top: posterior distribution of viral etiology; bottom left (right): posterior etiology distribution for top two causes given a bacterial (viral) infection. The blue circles are the 95% credible regions within the bacterial or viral groups.",
