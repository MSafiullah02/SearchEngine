Using available telehealth technology in patient rooms may allow physical therapists to participate in patient care without donning scarce PPE resources. For patients who are conscious and have volitional movement, therapists could teach a safe bed or chair-based exercise and mobility program to reduce deconditioning. For those who are sedated, therapists could virtually guide nursing staff on integrating early mobilization principles into tasks already taking place in the room. While an imperfect solution, it may help reduce hospital-acquired disability during an ICU stay.",

These basic strategies could improve overall physical activity during hospitalization more than exercise handouts or other passive exercise strategies.2)Consider developing rehabilitation at home models for COVID-19 survivors after discharge\n",

Therapists can provide exercise equipment to patients from clinics for use during the entirety of rehabilitation stays, which limits cross-contamination concerns from therapy gyms and allows therapy to be carried out with greater intensity. Because Medicare allows clinic-based physical therapists to bill for care provided at home to any patient, this is a solution which is quickly actionable and may preserve PPE to a greater extent than daily therapy in a rehabilitation facility.",
