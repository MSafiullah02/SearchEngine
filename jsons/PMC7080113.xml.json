Researchers in this field are driven by the need to develop ultrasensitive detectors for fast separations, which deliver as much information about the analyte as possible.",

Although a variety of excitation sources are available, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) is most easily adapted to the dimensions of microchips. The coherence and low divergence of a laser beam makes it easy to focus on very small detection volumes and to obtain very high irradiation, resulting in one of the lowest limits of detection of any detection system. Lamp-based excitation systems represent a less expensive but more flexible alternative in terms of the choice of wavelength. Microscope-based detector set-ups using xenon or mercury lamps are applied to a variety of different analytical problems with impressive results. The recent advances in the development of high-output light-emitting diodes (LED) are reflected in the growing number of publications that use this excitation principle. Their small size and low cost of production facilitate the incorporation of LEDs into microfluidic devices. Optical detection without any need for an excitation source or a complicated optical set-up can be accomplished by means of chemiluminescence (CL) measurements. As no additional light source is required, no background light is generated at all. This results in low limits of detection as well as excellent selectivity.",

It has been used for the determination of half-antibody species in immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) [11, 12] and the detection of the Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris bacterium in orange juice [13]. The instrument enables bioassays to be performed on primed microchips, and gives limits of detection in the lower \u03bcg per ml range. The overall package, consisting of sample preparation kit, microchip, detector and adapted software, is well-suited for a range of routine analyses but lacks the flexibility and modularity usually required in research set-ups. Hence, the vast majority of laboratory systems are homemade. They usually consist of the following basic parts: a laser excitation source, an optical system to focus and collect the light, and a photosensitive detector, generally a photomultiplier tube (PMT).",

The second approach (Fig. 1b) uses the same objective to focus and collect the light, and a dichroic mirror for wavelength separation [18\u201325]. For fast operation and fast optical alignment, all of the optical components of those (epifluorescence) systems are often incorporated into a fluorescence microscope [26\u201330]. A pinhole is commonly placed at the focal point along the light path to get spatial filtering of the emission and to reduce scattered and background light. The diameters of those pinholes range from 40 \u03bcm to 2 mm.\n\n",

They use a LIF detection system based on an orthogonal optical arrangement. Using an excitation beam perpendicular to the chip, highly sensitive detection was achieved by collimating the emission light from the microchannel through the sidewall of the chip (Fig. 4). A special microchip layout was used to bring the separation channel in close proximity with the sidewall (1.5 mm), which was intensively polished to form a highly transparent surface. The emitted light was collimated with a microscope objective and focused onto a 900 \u03bcm pinhole. Two filters excluded the remaining excitation light, while the actual detection was performed by a PMT. The amount of scattered light as well as fluorescence emission was found to be dependent on the viewing angle in the plane with the chip. Studies of both intensities with regards to the viewing angle revealed the most favorable ratio between the fluorescence signal and the scattered light at a collection angle of 45\u00b0, which was then used for further measurements. The limit of detection for fluorescein was 1.1 pM. The performance of the system was further demonstrated by the separation of FITC-labeled amino acids, which could be achieved at a concentration of 100 pM with RSD values of 3.0 and 3.6% obtained for FITC\u2013arginine and FITC\u2013phenylalanine, respectively.\n\n",

Fruetel et al. presented a hand-held CE\u2013LIF device with very impressive abilities [42]. The device utilizes fused silica microchips to perform simultaneous capillary zone and capillary gel electrophoresis with LIF detection. The instrument has a modular design, including a separation platform with a multichannel high-voltage power supply, a battery pack and a control panel equipped with an LCD panel for direct evaluation. The separation platform itself incorporates a microchip (2 \u00d7 3 cm) with two mirrored separation channels, onto which two 392 nm laser diodes are focused. An aperture and a lens pair gave a near-Gaussian beam with ~1 mW power delivered to each channel at Brewster\u2019s angle (37\u00b0). Fluorescence emission was collimated by an aspherical lens and was detected by a PMT after passing a 460 nm long-pass filter. The detection of both channels with one single PMT was achieved by asynchronously pulsing the laser diodes at 10 Hz and using a 50% duty cycle. Software deconvolution separated the data stream into electropherograms corresponding to each channel. Since it was developed for the detection of biological warfare agents, the device was successfully applied to the separation and detection of fluorescamine-labeled ricin and staphylococcal enterotoxin samples. Additional changes in the design of the instrument, such as the development of a 16-channel high-voltage power supply, a new cartridge-based fluid delivery system, and a redesigned microchip layout (2 \u00d7 2 cm) improved the applicability and stability of the system even further [43]. By providing bidirectional currents of up to 100 \u03bcA at 5000 V, the high voltage modules enabled real-time current and voltage monitoring, too. Laser-induced fluorescence detection allowed mid-picomolar (10\u221211 M) sensitivity to fluorescent dyes and low nanomolar sensitivity for fluorescamine-labeled proteins. It was found that the reproducibility of the migration time could be significantly improved when separations were performed under constant current control (0.5\u20131%) compared to constant voltage control (2\u20138%).",

The optimum distance was found to be 100 \u03bcm. The emission light was guided through the optical fiber through a band-pass emission filter and was detected by a PMT. Limits of detection were significantly improved compared to previous results [64]. For fluorescein and rhodamine dyes, they were found to be in the mid-nanomolar range, but a microscope-based LIF system gave a 20-fold improvement in sensitivity. This is explained by the fact that all of the laser light is easily focused onto the microchannel, while despite its close proximity, only 25% of the emitted light of the LED could be used for detection. Further improvements in sensitivity are anticipated when an LED with a smaller light-emitting face and optimized driving conditions are used.",

OLEDs are not frequently used for this purpose because they are not yet commercially available and are still under development. The big advantage of OLEDs compared to LEDs is their flat film-like shape. This makes it easy to incorporate them into microfluidic devices and to bring them into close proximity to the separation channel. However, their fairly broad emission spectra require the additional application of excitation filters. In the work presented, a 0.3 mm-thick interference filter combined with a 400 \u03bcm pinhole is used to achieve effective excitation with the appropriate wavelength (Fig. 6). Detection of the emission light is accomplished by an optical fiber coupled to a PMT. With this system, a detection limit of 3 \u03bcmol/L was achieved for the Alexa 532 fluorescent dye. Since this is several orders of magnitude less sensitive than common LIF detection systems, the current drawbacks of OLEDs such as low irradiance and light purity must be solved in order to improve LODs.\n\n",

Because the light is generated by a chemical reaction, no excitation light source is required and a filter system to reduce the background is not necessary. This simplified set-up is obviously attractive when attempting to integrate chemiluminescence detection onto microchips. However, because the chemiluminescence reagent needs to be mixed with the separated analytes before detection, a more complex microchip layout is required. Liu et al. [66] developed several chip layouts (Fig. 7) and evaluated their performance with respect to different chemiluminescence model systems, including the metal ion-catalyzed luminol\u2013peroxide reaction and the dansyl species-conjugated peroxalate\u2013peroxide reaction. The separation of Cr(III), Co(II) and Cu(II) ions as well as the chiral recognition of dansyl\u2013phenylalanine enantiomers could be accomplished within one minute with low micromolar and even submicromolar limits of detection. A comparison between the different chip layouts showed that the pattern with the Y-shaped junction (Fig. 7, left) was preferred by the luminol\u2013peroxide system, while a V-shaped junction (Fig. 7, right) yielded better results with the peroxalate\u2013peroxide system. The V-shaped design was later applied to the submicromolar detection of ATP and ATP-conjugated metabolites using a firefly luciferin\u2013luciferase bioluminescence system [67].\n\n",

In ECL, an electroactive compound, in this case tris(2,2\u2032-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) ([Ru(bpy)3]2+), is oxidized by applying a voltage to additional electrodes in the separation channel, and it subsequently reacts with the analytes with the emission of photons. In the work presented, thin-film indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes were added during microchip fabrication [71]. The transparency of the ITO material makes these electrodes superior to the more widely used platinum-based electrodes, because none of the photons generated are absorbed or deflected. The method developed was applied to the detection of proline and the determination of lincomycin in urine down to a concentration of 9 \u03bcmol/L [72], while the additional evaluation of the current at the ITO electrodes enabled their simultaneous electrochemical detection due to the catalytic effects of the oxidized [Ru(bpy)3]3+ [73]. They further simplified their system by immobilizing the ruthenium complex on the ITO electrodes [74]. This approach delivered detection limits similar to the system described earlier, but no addition of the complex to the running buffer was required, which drastically reduced the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ consumption.",

While laser-induced fluorescence, with its superior sensitivity, only lacks a certain amount of flexibility regarding the choice of wavelengths, this gap is filled by less expensive lamp-based excitation sources. Depending on the application, the ability to choose the excitation wavelength frequently seems to compensate for a loss in sensitivity of ~2\u20133 decades. New designs, including integrated optical fibers and highly sensitive detectors, show that the sensitivity possible with lamp-based excitation can still be improved.",

To minimize this problem, recent publications show the use of integrated optical fibers and detection cells with extended light paths.
