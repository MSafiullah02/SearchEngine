Thus, it seems of paramount importance to point out the risk of severe PI during RT for breast cancer in patients who became infected by COVID-19 during the period of their treatment. High caution for indications and volume definition is recommended when RT cannot be delayed in high risk patients. In RNI cases, IMRT (which increase only low doses), breathing adaptation and prone/lateral positioning may help to reduce ipsilateral lung exposure (8, 9). However, prone/lateral position can not allow adequate nodal coverage. Moreover, hypofractionation was reported to reduce lung dose irradiation (1). Of note, our patient had moderate hypofractionated schedule due to her age and the distance between her home and our department.",

Any extended lung radiation could expose BC patients to a high risk of lung damage induced by COVID-19 infection. For patients receiving chemotherapy, lymphopenia is an additional risk factor for the severe form of COVID-19 lung infection.
