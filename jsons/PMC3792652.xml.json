Subjects included 96 children referred to the acute care nebulization room for wheezing by a triage physician. They required at least a nebulized bronchodilator (albuterol) for treatment. Children seen in the ED for nonwheezing disorders (n = 191) were enrolled as control subjects. They included 65 children who had been hospitalized or treated in the ED or who had been using medications prescribed by a physician for asthma during the last 12 months. Data from the latter group, who were defined as having \u201cstable asthma\u201d at the time of enrollment, were compared with data obtained from the actively wheezing children and other nonwheezing control subjects in a post hoc analysis. Children with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, or immunodeficiency or oncologic disorders were not enrolled.",

Demographic information and subjects' characteristics were obtained from questionnaires administered to parents. The questionnaires focused on each child's history for asthma treatments, family history for allergic disorders, and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure at home. Informed consent was obtained from parents, and informed assent was obtained from children who participated.

A high degree of concordance was observed between RT-PCR and real-time PCR methods for detecting rhinovirus (percentage of absolute agreement, 93.3%; 95% CI, 89.8% to 95.9%). Additionally, strains of rhinovirus and enterovirus were identified by means of PCR and sequencing of a region comprising the VP4 and partial VP2 capsid protein genes.21, 22\n",

For both the binomial and multinomial contingency table analyses, the 2-sided null hypothesis rejection rule was set at a P value of .05 or less. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine whether a child's wheezing status was associated with rhinovirus infection and atopic status. Tests of association were based on the type III Wald \u03c72 statistic, and a P value of .05 or less was used to identify significant associations. Total serum IgE levels, titers of allergen-specific IgE antibody, and Feno levels were analyzed on a logarithmic scale by using 2-way ANOVA. The 2 sources of variation considered in the ANOVA were the study group and the season of data collection. The rejection rule for hypothesis testing was based on a P value of .05 or less, and 95% CI construction for the ratio of the geometric means (GMs) was based on the Student t test distribution.

Data from the nonasthmatic control subjects in the present investigation, as well as from younger children evaluated for respiratory tract infections in other studies, suggest that the frequency of infections with group A and C strains might be similar.16, 21 This suggests that the airway in patients with asthma might be more susceptible to infections with group C strains. At present, the receptor used by group C viruses to infect epithelial cells is not known. The cell-surface receptor used by group A strains is the adhesion molecule intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1).23, 24 Previous studies, including our own, indicate that the expression of ICAM-1 (both soluble and membrane ICAM-1) is reduced in the asthmatic airway,25, 26 which might give group C viruses a selective advantage for infecting the asthmatic respiratory tract epithelium. In our patient population Feno and specific IgE levels were similar among children infected with group C and group A strains. Recently, the significance of allergy in response to rhinovirus was also suggested by the significant decrease in asthma exacerbations among children treated with omalizumab, a subset of whom were infected with RV.27 The beneficial effects of inhaled corticosteroids, which also reduce TH2 inflammation and prevent asthma exacerbations during childhood, also support this observation.28, 29\n",

In the present study the positive correlation between titers of IgE to D pteronyssinus, D farinae, or B tropicalis and Feno levels provides further evidence for the relevance of dust mite allergen to the pathogenesis of airway inflammation.",

            "text": "In conclusion, this investigation highlights the significant risk for asthma attacks caused by rhinovirus among children with high titers of IgE antibodies, which was most often associated with sensitization to dust mite allergen in Costa Rica. Thus far, antiviral treatments, including vaccines, to treat infections with rhinovirus have been difficult to develop because of antigenic diversity among rhinovirus strains. The predisposition of asthmatic patients to become infected with group C strains might offer a more targeted approach for developing antiviral treatments. However, this approach would not be effective for the 40% of wheezing children who did not have positive test results for rhinovirus in this study and might not be effective in preventing attacks of asthma caused by group A strains. Alternatively, treatments focused on decreasing allergic airway inflammation could provide a broader approach to prevent and/or decrease the severity of asthma exacerbations caused by rhinovirus. Thus results from this study provide strong evidence that characterizing the atopic status of asthmatic children in greater detail, including their titers of allergen-specific IgE antibodies, is needed both to enhance investigations focused on mechanisms of rhinovirus-induced attacks of asthma and to identify children who are most likely to benefit from allergen-specific therapies.Key messages\n\u2022Rhinovirus infections, both group C and group A strains, were significantly associated with asthma exacerbations among Costa Rican children evaluated during the dry and rainy seasons.\u2022Most asthmatic children (93% with current wheeze) were sensitized to dust mite allergen, and titers of IgE to mite allergens correlated significantly with levels of total IgE and Feno.\u2022High titers of allergen-specific IgE to dust mite significantly increased the risk for acute wheezing provoked by rhinovirus.\n\n",
