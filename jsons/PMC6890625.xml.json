During 25 years of follow-up in a large cohort study in the USA, dementia incidence was approximately 80% higher in those with diabetes compared with those without diabetes [4]. Among individuals in late midlife, those with diabetes had a 24% faster cognitive decline than those without diabetes [5]. For disability, the Global Burden of Disease Study showed that diabetes was the sixth most common cause of disability in 2015 [2]. England and Wales have recently experienced favourable declines in smoking prevalence and BP levels. These possibly explain the 2.7% annual decrease in dementia incidence observed in the last two decades [1]. However, there is evidence of worsening trends in other, potentially important, risk factors for both dementia and disability. The prevalence of adult obesity increased from 15% in 1993 to 26% in 2010 before recently plateauing [6]. Type 2 diabetes prevalence, driven mainly by obesity trends, more than doubled between 1993 and 2015 and is expected to increase further from 8.6% in 2015 to 9.7% by 2035, generating more than 1.1 million additional cases in England [7, 8]. Midlife obesity and type 2 diabetes have both been shown to be related to dementia and disability incidence, based on evidence from observational studies [2, 9, 10].",

We assumed that the affected transition probabilities were those representing the risk of CVD and non-CVD death, cognitive decline incidence, CVD incidence, disability incidence and recovery from disability. To model these changes in transition probabilities, we used an approach based on the population attributable risk fraction (PARF). The PARF calculates the proportion by which disease burden would be reduced if there were no diabetes in the population. A simpler version of this approach has been used previously in other IMPACT models [19, 20].",

For the rest of the scenarios, we modified the prevalence in each category across time to match the ageing of the population (more details are provided in ESM Chapter 4.5 and Figs 13\u201320) We obtained the RRs from published studies and by carrying out meta-analyses (see ESM Chapter 4, ESM Figs 10\u201311 and ESM Table 1).

This corresponds to 81,000 and 17,000 fewer cases of dementia each year worldwide and in the USA, respectively, if diabetes prevalence decreases by 10%. Our results are far more conservative. It is likely that Barnes and Yaffe\u2019s analysis over-estimated the potential burdens, because it did not account for any observed trends in risk factors, mortality or dementia, nor consider competing risks of mortality from CVD as opposed to dementia. Moreover, these analyses, based on simple PAR approaches, did not account for any relationship between diabetes duration and outcomes. Several studies have reported that the RR of fatal CHD increases in individuals with diabetes as the years lived with the disease increases [21, 23, 25].",

The structure of the model allowed us to take into account the risks between these conditions and competing risks of dying from cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes. Diabetes increases the risk of dying, not only from CVD, but also from many other diseases, including several cancers. Given the declining population risk of CVD mortality in future years, the competing risk of non-CVDs is expected to become critical. Our model accounts for this by separating projections of future cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular risk of death, which represents a substantial improvement on previous methodologies [24, 26]. Specifically, we account for trends in CVD- and non-CVD mortality and incidence, trends in dementia incidence, competing risks between cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular risk factors. Our methods also account for the increase in risk of both CVD and dementia caused by the time spent living with diabetes. IMPACT-BAM also models the time lag between newly developed diabetes and its complications. To our knowledge, there are no previous studies modelling the effect of prevention of diabetes on dementia and disability which also take into consideration the time needed to develop diabetes complications. This makes our estimates closer to real-life settings. Finally, our prediction model estimates the positive and negative effects of changes in diabetes prevalence. Our scenarios of possible future diabetes burden were based on reasonable assumptions of future obesity trends.",

Although obesity is widely recognised as the main driver of the current diabetes epidemic, diabetes trends can also be driven by many other risk factors that may have contrasting trends such as physical activity or pharmacological intervention in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance [27]. In addition, the DPM model (available on PHE official website) lacks information on any potential methodological limitations. Moreover, our approach to projecting the future distribution of the diabetes duration in the population does not account for increased risk of death due to longer duration of diabetes. This can lead to overestimation of the number of participants with longer duration of diabetes, and overestimating the total effect of a change in diabetes prevalence on dementia and disability incidence.",

With a 35-year perspective we might expect a shift in the burden of diabetes consequences, from CVD towards a much broader range of sequelae including dementia. Our study suggests that preventing diabetes is important, not only for future CVD, but also for the dementia and disability burden. Moreover, as CVD mortality continues to decline, we expect a further shift in the burden of diabetes to non-cardiovascular complications. Contrary to some other diabetes complications, such as nephropathy or retinopathy, people with cognitive decline and dementia cannot be offered treatment to significantly slow down the progress of the disease. Since an older population structure is the leading reason for the increase in the dementia burden, it is reasonable to expect that dementia will increase as a share of diabetes complications.",
