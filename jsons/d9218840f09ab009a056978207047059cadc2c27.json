One center primarily used rapid antigen testing for diagnosis. Table 2 describes RBV usage and dosing for treatment of RSV infection. Inhaled RBV was not used for outpatients at any center, but was used for inpatients in 8 centers. In the 4 centers that did not use inhaled RBV, reasons included cost, inconvenience, safety concerns regarding teratogenicity, and lack of efficacy. Three of these 4 stated a specific preference for oral RBV. Six centers used both oral and inhaled RBV depending on the clinical situation: 2 preferentially utilized inhaled RBV; the remaining 4 utilized inhaled or oral RBV on a case-by-case and/or service-specific basis. One of these centers noted that inhaled RBV was used in more severe cases. One center did not routinely use inhaled or oral RBV, but used IVIG as monotherapy in some circumstances. In the 5 other centers that used IVIG, it was given in combination with inhaled or oral RBV. IVIG was not used for treatment of URTI by any center, and 2 centers used IVIG only in cases where the patient was hypogammaglobulinemic. No center used palivizumab, with 1 center reporting in follow-up communication that palivizumab was too expensive for use in adult patients.",

For oral RBV, dosing ranged from 800 to 1800 mg daily; for reference, recommended dosing for hepatitis C virus ranges from 800 to 1400 mg daily (weight-based dosing). Oral RBV for RSV therapy is an off-label use, and little information is available to define the appropriate dose. In the available literature, dosing strategies vary, and include non-weight-based and weight-based regimens ranging typically from 15 mg/ kg/day to 22.5 mg/kg/day (4, 10-13). Inhaled RBV is approved for use in children at a dose of 6 g aerosolized over 12-18 h. This long duration of nebulization can be difficult to tolerate and often disrupts other patient care activities. Limited data suggest than an intermittent dosing schedule is equal, in terms of safety, and may be superior in preventing progression to LRTI (14) . This alternative intermittent dosing schedule of 2 g aerosolized every 8 h (typically for a 2-h period with each administration) was the most commonly used regimen in our survey. Inhaled RBV was used more frequently than oral in most of the scenarios that were presented, and particularly in scenarios involving LRTI. Of the available treatments, inhaled RBV has been the most studied. A systematic review suggested benefit in terms of decreased progression to LRTI and mortality with administration of inhaled RBV plus monoclonal (palivizumab) or polyclonal antibody preparations (IVIG, RSV-IVIG) (8) . Other retrospective studies in HSCT populations have shown similar results (2, 9) . Evidence for the efficacy of oral RBV is more limited; however, some retrospective studies suggest that it is well tolerated in HSCT and lung transplant recipients (4, 10, 11, 13) . In the same systematic review noted above, oral RBV in combination with IVIG and/or palivizumab was associated with lower rates of progression to LRTI and mortality, although the effect was not as pronounced as that seen with inhaled RBV combined with immunomodulators (IVIG, RSV-IVIG, and/or palivizumab) (8) . Of note, RSV-IVIG is no longer commercially available. A study aimed at determining the efficacy of RSV-IVIG for prophylaxis of RSV infection in allogeneic HSCT recipients was unable to determine benefit (15) . Likewise, palivizumab is costly and has not proven to be efficacious in preventing progression of URTI to LRTI, or reducing mortality in adult allogeneic HSCT recipients (6, 16) .",

For inhaled RBV, the main limitations for outpatient administration include cost (a treatment course of inhaled RBV typically costs $14,000-$23,000 compared with a course of oral RBV, which is $300-$700) and difficulty of administration. Tents are necessary because of concern for environmental contamination and potential teratogenicity to healthcare workers (11) . Lung transplant patients had the highest rates of treatment at the URTI stage and were the only patient population where unanimity existed regarding the decision to treat LRTI. A multidrug regimen of inhaled RBV, IVIG, corticosteroids, and palivizumab showed efficacy in maintaining allograft function after RSV infection (17) . Furthermore, studies evaluating the use of oral RBV suggest that it is equivalent to inhaled RBV for treatment of RSV in lung transplants (4) . In non-lung SOTs and in patients with hematologic malignancy, most centers would not treat URTI, which is consistent with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommending against routine treatment of RSV URTI in neutropenic patients (18) . LRTI was treated at higher rates; however, studies evaluating the incidence and spectrum of RSV infection in these populations are scarce.",

            "text": "From our survey, it is apparent that treatment strategies varied greatly among institutions. Although many centers do treat LRTI, treatment of URTI was more variable. While inhaled RBV was used more commonly, no consensus existed regarding its use compared to oral RBV or regarding the use of IVIG. Given the potential severity of RSV infection in adult immunocompromised patients, this variability demonstrates the critical need for well-designed studies examining currently used and novel agents. Attempts at randomized studies examining the efficacy of inhaled RBV in the past have not been successful owing to poor enrollment and perhaps reluctance to accept a placebo arm, and we would not advocate repeating that effort. Larger multicenter non-interventional trials could better identify risk factors for poor outcomes and identify populations most likely to benefit from expensive and potentially toxic therapies such as inhaled or oral RBV. The issue, however, may be solved as new therapies are tested and approved. ALN-RSVO1, a topically administered small interfering RNA; GS-5806, an oral fusion inhibitor; and MDT-637, an inhaled viral fusion inhibitor, are in various stages of development and provide hope that a proven effective treatment will soon be available (6, (19) (20) (21) . For the present, our study provides insight into current practices in large transplant centers.",
