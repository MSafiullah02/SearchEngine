The Chariot Program is funded through philanthropic donations and is composed of a multidisciplinary group of pediatric anesthesiologists, pediatric pain physicians, and research scientists. The Chariot Program utilized a 3-step approach to develop the hospital\u2019s VR program: (1) software development; (2) hardware modification; and (3) integration into clinical care. Although there exists VR content that is commercially available for purchase, the Chariot Program developed and customized several VR applications specifically for pediatric patients. Developed content was nonviolent, was intuitive for the user to learn, had limited startup menus to ensure rapid access and immediate gameplay, utilized third-person rather than the first-person perspective, kept the head mostly or entirely still, and had no fail-states (eg, the user\u2019s character cannot die or become incapacitated in any way). In some circumstances, the content was complementary to patient care; for example, content that kept the head still and paired the headset with a handheld controller could be used for ENT endoscopy, whereas gameplay designed to keep the extremities still and instead use slight head movement could be used for intravenous access or orthopedic procedures. We organized this VR content on a customized VR interface, also produced by Chariot, which curates a content library while also prohibiting typical cellular phone features such as access to the internet (this is simply a safety measure to ensure children cannot access anything besides what is intended by providers). Samsung (Seoul, South Korea) GearVR headsets fitted with Samsung S8+ cellular phones were used to display the VR interface and applications. Customized head straps were designed with 3D-printed attachments and commercially available ratchets to ensure infection control compliance and fit to pediatric head circumferences.",

The physician Chariot Program Manager trained CCLS with an emphasis on sanitization procedures and a process for securing the device while not in use. Locked cabinets were used to store the devices in areas convenient for the users. Within these locked cabinets, we used a Samsung Wireless Charging station to charge the devices. CCLS were additionally trained by the physician Chariot Program Manager to assess potential adverse events during VR interventions. Patients were evaluated by trained CCLS, who made individualized treatment plans based on a repository of tools available to them. Potential VR patient candidates were 6 years or older without a history of seizure or motion sickness. After screening patients, CCLS introduced VR as a possible coping mechanism and, with patient agreement, proceeded to utilize it. A variety of active and passive applications were offered, and the patient had the option to choose their own experience. The individualized interventions were not controlled, as this was a retrospective review.",

Age, gender, adverse events, patient location, and interventions accompanying VR were also measured through a chart review of the CCLS intervention note.

For example, all the VR experiences maintain a third-person rather than the first-person point of view, because the first-person point of view is more likely to contribute to motion sickness.28 The content additionally limits the head range of motion, especially flexion and extension of the neck, to reduce vestibular motion.

Instead, it was usually complemented by other interventions, including diaphragmatic breathing, family presence, pharmacological assistance, environmental adaptations, and video games. When VR was used alone, VR was provided to patients who were cooperative before the CCLS encounter. VR often requires a cooperative patient who is willing to wear a headset and suspend belief to partake in a VR environment. Although it appears that younger patients (age 6 to 12 years old) were more likely to benefit from VR, this analysis was exploratory and not powered to detect subgroups that may respond more or less robustly to VR. Although the increases in cooperation may seem like small absolute differences, an improvement, however, small, in cooperation is not what would be anticipated. Generally speaking, when facing imminent medical interventions, most pediatric patients become less cooperative and may withdraw from the intervention. Maintenance or improvement of patient cooperation is clinically significant, in our opinion.",

Our approach of using surrogates, such as self-reported measures in large numbers, is not ideal but provides initial evidence with a large sample size that can be corroborated by smaller studies using validated outcome measures. Because CCLS reported adverse events without a standardized set of questions asked of patients, there may have been adverse events not observed by CCLS or verbalized by patients. Some patients were excluded from the analysis because they lacked complete data. Our findings examining the efficacy of VR interventions are exploratory, and the present study was not powered to compare the effectiveness of VR to existing interventions. As VR appears to be a safe intervention, future studies should quantify the efficacy of VR compared to other existing interventions and aim to uncover specific subpopulations for which VR is most effective.
