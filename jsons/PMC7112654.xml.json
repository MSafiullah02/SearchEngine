The polarity-specific nature of life events can lead to manic/hypomanic or depressive mood symptoms through excessive BAS activation or deactivation, respectively (Johnson, 2005a, Johnson et al., 2008a, Johnson et al., 2016, Nusslock et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Due to impaired BAS, individuals with BD are hypersensitive to cues signaling an opportunity for reward and those signifying failure and loss of reward (Urosevic et al., 2010). Research has demonstrated the pertinent mechanism (Alloy et al., 2009, Depue and Iacono, 1989, Harmon-Jones et al., 2002, Johnson, 2005b, Johnson and Carver, 2006, Johnson et al., 2008a, Nusslock et al., 2007, Urosevic et al., 2008, Wright et al., 2009). When vulnerable individuals experience events relevant to BAS activation\u2014such as the offer of a reward, encouragement of goal striving and attainment, provocation of anger\u2014their hypersensitive BAS becomes excessively activated when they get an opportunity for active coping. Such a situation potentially leads to (hypo)manic symptoms. Alternatively, in response to BAS-deactivating life events, such as imminent failure, loss, or nonattainment of goals, a hypersensitive BAS is excessively deactivated, leading to a shutdown of BAS without an opportunity for active coping. Such a situation potentially leads to depressive symptoms. However, poor emotion regulation is signified in the response to BAS-relevant contextual cues (Urosevic et al., 2008). If such sensitivity is deemed to be related to a biological vulnerability, improving the ability to cope with life events is desirable, and the fit and adaptability of coping are critical to understanding how individuals with BD are likely to cope with different life events.",

Effective coping involving a good fit indicates a good match between the nature of coping strategies and the characteristics of the situation. Typically, problem-focused coping is assumed to be adaptive in controllable situations, whereas emotion-focused coping in uncontrollable situations (Lazarus, 1999, Roubinov et al., 2015). However, emotion-focused coping can sometimes be linked to controllable stressors (Mah et al., 2008), and problem-focused coping is also suggested to deal with uncontrollable situations (Danielsen et al., 2013). Research has shown, however, that using problem-focused coping in controllable life events may not benefit individuals with BD during a manic phase (Urosevic et al., 2008), because it would further increase BAS activation and thus could easily exacerbate (hypo)manic symptoms. Using emotion-focused coping in facing uncontrollable life events may also cause harm to individuals with BD during a depressive phase (Wright et al., 2009), as it would further reduce their volition to manage their mood state.",

            "text": "In the past decade, the coping flexibility model has been applied to normal populations and people with a medical illness, and samples have usually involved university students, working adults, patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, or patients with functional dyspepsia (Cheng, 2001, Cheng, 2003, Cheng et al., 1999, Cheng et al., 2000, Cheng et al., 2004, Cheng et al., 2012). The model has yet to be applied to people with mental health concerns. As an individual's decision-making process can be influenced by his or her affective state (Forgas and Eich, 2013), the fluctuating mood of BD may affect appraisal or coping responses during the transactional process. Thus, the goodness of fit concept in coping flexibility may be applied differently to people with and without BD. Coping strategies relating to the behavioral dimension (i.e., behavioral deactivation and activation) and the emotional dimension (i.e., emotion diminishing and amplifying) have also been proposed. Behavioral-activation coping shares similar components with problem-focused coping, while emotion-diminishing coping shares corresponding elements with emotion-focused coping. However, the usual application of coping (Lazarus, 1999) may not be appropriate for people with BD who are dealing with fluctuating mood states (Edge et al., 2013, Lam and Wong, 1997, Lam et al., 2001, Wong and Lam, 1999). Further research is needed to clarify the use of different kinds of coping strategies for people with and without BD. Furthermore, it is pertinent to test the possible moderating effect of coping between BD diagnosis and mood states.",

Alternatively, impairment in psychosocial function can be treated as a risk factor for affective symptoms in BD (Gitlin et al., 1995, Nolen et al., 2004, Weinstock and Miller, 2008, Weinstock and Miller, 2010). Research has shown that coping mitigates the effect of psychosocial functional impairment on subsequent mood symptoms (Morris et al., 2005, Yang, 2006). It seems that coping may have additional value beyond BAS sensitivity level or psychosocial functioning level in explaining mood states. Therefore, it warrants further investigation by incorporating these two essential elements, which is the intention of the present study.",

Through a cross-sectional design, it was hypothesized that coping flexibility has an additional value over BAS sensitivity level or psychosocial functional level in explaining mood states.

The LES was originally designed to assess 193 defined life event categories spanning various domains which include a wide array of BAS-activating and BAS-deactivating events. To make the life event scenarios vivid in this study, they were all role-played and videotaped by the author (SC) and a research assistant. The ten life event scenarios were elaborated at the individual/achievement and interpersonal/relationship level:(i)You received appreciation from family or friends for the completion of household tasks,(ii)You received a huge amount of money so that you could achieve your life goals,(iii)You got a job that you really wanted,(iv)You were accepted into desired social group,(v)You received a positive reaction from family or friends about doing well at work,(vi)At work, your boss gave you a raise or a promotion due to good performance,(vii)You planned, organized, or prepared a vacation or trip,(viii)You won a significant award for your achievements at work,(ix)You hosted a social event, and(x)You accomplished an important task at work.\n",

The pilot group verified the content of the life event scenarios to be BAS-activating. Such a presentation of visual stimuli has been found to be a reliable means to induce positive mood change (Martin, 1990). In the actual field study, two compulsory and two elective scenarios were presented. The participants were asked to watch the video clips and to vividly imagine encountering the situation portrayed in real life. The coping indices were established in terms of the following scores:(a)The perceived controllability score. After watching the video clips, the participants rated the perceived controllability of the stimuli on a six-point scale, with a higher score indicating greater perceived controllability. The scores included the average and the variance of the perceived controllability across the four life events.(b)The coping strategies score. A list of coping strategies was compiled that included strategies of problem-focused (PF) and emotion-focused (EF) coping (Carver, 1997, Carver et al., 1989), behavioral-activation and behavioral-deactivation coping (Lam and Wong, 1997, Lam et al., 2001, Wong and Lam, 1999), and emotion-amplifying and emotion-diminishing coping (Edge et al., 2013). Participants reported their repertoire of coping responses after their cognitive appraisal. The operationalization of the coping strategies score involved two major dimensions: (a) mean and variability in the number of PF and EF coping strategies, and (b) mean and variability in the number of behavioral-activation/emotion-amplifying (AA) and behavioral-deactivation/emotion-diminishing (DD) coping strategies across the four stimuli.(c)Strategy-situation fit. This score represents the goodness-of-fit hypothesis specified by the transactional theory of coping (Lazarus and Folkman, 1984). A response that meets the goodness-of-fit criteria (i.e., Fit1 = assumes using PF coping for controllable stimuli and EF coping for uncontrollable stimuli; Fit2 = assumes using AA coping for controllable stimuli and DD coping for uncontrollable stimuli) scored 1, whereas all other responses scored 0. The strategy-situation fit score was derived by averaging the scores of the four stimuli, so possible average scores ranged between 0 and 1.\n",

The ISS is a self-report instrument that is sensitive to changes in affective states. Higher scores, specifically the subscales of ACT and WB, indicate elevated mood states. Translations and cultural adaptations of the scale were also carried out (Wild et al., 2005). For the present study, Mansell and Lam's (2006) present state version of the ISS was used, in which only the ACT and WB subscales were reported. The assessment was completed immediately post-mood induction, so that the instant mood states after viewing the videotaped vignettes were tracked.",

Second, this study was about the potential to cope with life events in the promotion of recovery and improving outcomes in people with BD. Using mood state as an outcome measure may have limited the implications to functional recovery only. Future research can extend the application to personal recovery orientation by using other outcome measures, such as stages of recovery scales (Tse et al., 2014a). Third, regarding the internal validity of the experimental design, there was no detailed test of the efficacy of the video clips depicting BAS-activating life events. The participants\u2019 responses to the experimentally devised scenarios may not reflect their experiences in daily life, as individual life experiences may contribute to changes that are not easily controlled. Moreover, their mood state outcomes may not fully indicate their mood symptoms within the short duration of the videos. Thus, further research on actual coping in naturalistic settings should be considered. Despite these limitations, the present explorative study has made several preliminary contributions to the body of knowledge.",

Coping flexibility has an additional value in predicting mood states beyond BAS sensitivity and psychosocial functioning levels, as indicated by the sequential multiple regression. This is concordant with previous studies demonstrating an emotion-amplifying effect on a variety of emotional states (Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2013). Moreover, the emotion amplification found in response to BAS-activating life events may also exacerbate the normative interaction between emotions and goals, which can be generalized across both healthy and clinical populations (Carver and Scheier, 1998, Martin et al., 2004). The additional role of EF coping is consistent with previous research showing an association between emotion-focused positive rumination and a higher level of positive affect or mood symptoms (Feldman et al., 2008, Fulford et al., 2008, Johnson et al., 2008b).",

It also significantly moderated the relationship between BD diagnosis and mood states. In general, mood states increased with fit index in the control group but remained relatively stable in the BD group. As such, a good strategy-situation fit in coping is linked to adaptive psychological well-being (Cheng, 2001, Cheng et al., 2007, Fresco et al., 2006, Gan et al., 2004, Katz et al., 2005, Mino and Kanemitsu, 2005) in which an improvement in mood is seen in individuals who are more flexible. The application of fit index to a healthy control group indicates adaptiveness. However, this seems to be inapplicable to people with BD, as an unfavorable outcome can be seen in the light of their propensity to maintain their (hypo)manic symptoms (Alloy et al., 2009). Maintenance of BAS activation, as reflected by a high level of ISS-WB, is independent of changes of fit index. Adaptive coping, as implied by a good fit index, may not be applicable to BD with persistent BAS activation (Urosevic et al., 2008). The adaptiveness of emotional sequelae may, in fact, have different dimensions in people with or without disrupted positive emotional functioning (Kang and Gruber, 2013). This finding is therefore consistent with previous findings showing a decrease in adaptive emotion regulation strategies among people with BD (Wolkenstein et al., 2014).",

When further scrutinized, perceived controllability had a moderating effect on the relationship between BD diagnosis and mood states. Specifically, it did not exert any significant effect on mood states in the healthy control group. However, it made an additional contribution to mood symptoms in the BD group, in which mood states increased markedly with perceived controllability. Essentially, BD is characterized by amplified emotionality (Gruber et al., 2013) with difficulty in emotional regulation (Johnson et al., 2007, Phillips and Vieta, 2007); such individuals\u2019 mood symptoms may, therefore, tend to be heightened if they feel a strong sense of perceived controllability after they are presented with BAS-activating life events. In general, perceived controllability over positive emotions is associated with beneficial mental health outcomes (Folkman and Moskowitz, 2000, Gruber et al., 2011). However, people with BD usually have difficulty in controlling intense positive emotions (Gruber, 2011, Johnson et al., 2007), which can be detrimental to their mental health. The failure to control such passions may also easily lead to severe functional impairment, morbidity, and even mortality (Dilsaver, 2011).",

A good strategy-situation fit and flexibility in coping may imply adaptive psychological well-being (Cheng, 2001, Cheng et al., 2007, Fresco et al., 2006, Gan et al., 2004, Katz et al., 2005, Mino and Kanemitsu, 2005) in healthy controls, but this is not the case in people with BD. As reflected by the findings, the traditional concept of goodness of fit (Lazarus, 1999) is not applicable to people with BD. Specifically, the inclusion of emotional dysregulation can turn the original matching on the opposite direction. The findings further show that the assumed application of coping strategies in normal controls may not be adaptive in people with BD dealing with fluctuating moods.",

Perceived controllability may connote the adoption of an active role or exertion of effort to alter the environment. Therefore, curtailing the perceived controllability of life events seems to connote a sense of \u201cnon-striving,\u201d which is a core idea in mindfulness (Hayes, 2002, Kabat-Zinn, 1990, Kabat-Zinn, 1994). A sense of tranquility and serenity (Cahn and Polich, 2006) and coming to terms with bipolar disorder among middle-aged adults has been shown to calm a heightened mood effectively (Tse et al., 2014b). It is thus not surprising that there has recently been a steady growth in mindfulness-based therapies, which are an important psychosocial intervention for people with BD or at risk of BD (e.g., Cotton et al., 2016, Murray et al., 2015, Perich et al., 2013, Strawn et al., 2016, Weber et al., 2010). In the past decade, research has established the therapeutic effect of mindfulness on depression (e.g., Barnhofer et al., 2009, Kenny and Williams, 2007, Kingston et al., 2007). Most of these studies focused on reducing depressive symptoms (e.g., Lahera et al., 2014) or improving cognitive function (e.g., Howells et al., 2012). Recently, mindfulness has been shown to be beneficial to the emotion regulation in goal striving among people with BD (Gilbert and Gruber, 2014, Murray et al., 2015). The application of mindfulness-based interventions may also improve emotional processing on BD (Howells et al., 2014).",

Mindfulness training allows people to shift their attitude in order to embrace the principle of \u201cletting go\u201d (Frewen et al., 2008, Williams, 2008), which could be a remedy for the upsurge of perceived controllability across time. The present explorative study hopefully represents important groundwork for a shift of focus to regulating manic moods and the harnessing of the perceived controllability of life events through mindfulness.",
