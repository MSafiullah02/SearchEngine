E proteins are small (74-109 amino acids) hydrophobic viroporins (Hogue and Machamer, 2008, Ruch and Machamer, 2012a, Wilson et al., 2006, Wilson et al., 2004). The proteins consist of two distinct structural domains, a longer than typical hydrophobic domain and a charged cytoplasmic tail. E proteins from across the virus family exhibit amino acid sequence variability. However, E proteins from other coronaviruses can replace MHV E (Kuo et al., 2007). This suggests that the proteins provide a common function that is interchangeable among the viruses, but this has not been tested yet for other CoVs. Surprisingly, a truncated variant of the M protein was shown to also enhance the growth of MHV lacking the E gene (Kuo and Masters, 2010). Even though the effect on growth was positive, infectious virus titers in the presence of the M variant were 100-fold lower than for wild-type MHV and the mutant viruses appeared to be less stable.",

Deletion of the E proteins from the \u03b1 genus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) results in replication-competent, but propagation-defective viruses, as is the case with the \u03b2 genus Middle Eastern Syndrome virus (MERS) (Curtis et al., 2002) (Almazan et al., 2013, Ortego et al., 2007, Ortego et al., 2002). SARS CoV, also a member of \u03b2 genus, exhibited only a 20- to 200-fold reduction in virus output in the absence of E that was dependent on the cell type used for infection (DeDiego et al., 2007, DeDiego et al., 2014, DeDiego et al., 2008).",

To help further our understanding of the mechanistic role(s) in virus assembly and egress or other roles that CoV E proteins play, we carried out a study to precisely define the cellular localization and expression dynamics of E from MHV A59, one of the long-standing prototype members of the \u03b2 genus. We show that MHV E localizes in both the ERGIC and Golgi and that the protein does not traffic to the cell surface during infection. The protein is oriented with its carboxy end on the cytoplasmic side of the membranes and the amino end on the luminal side, as was suggested some years ago. To investigate the kinetics of E trafficking, MHV was genetically engineered with a tetracysteine (TC) tag appended to the carboxy end of the protein to allow for real-time imaging during infection. When monitored in real-time, the E protein was found to be mobile in ER/ERGIC membranes. Additionally, using correlative light electron microscopy E was visualized directly in Golgi stacks. The results provide further support showing that CoV E proteins carry out their functions at intracellular membranes where virus assembly occurs. This is the first report to describe live-cell imaging of a CoV E protein, which expands opportunities to analyze the interplay between E proteins and their host cells to help further understanding of the functions they provide during morphogenesis and pathogenesis.",

The S and M proteins were analyzed in parallel as controls (data not shown). The S protein is known to colocalize with M at the site of assembly, but it is also transported to the cell surface (Heald-Sargent and Gallagher, 2012). The M protein localizes in the Golgi (Corse and Machamer, 2002, Klumperman et al., 1994). At 8 h p.i. the E and M proteins continued to colocalize as was observed at 6 h p.i. (\nFig. 2). By 12 h p.i. the M protein was localized in areas of the cell distant from the ERGIC/Golgi region, whereas the E protein remained localized at the perinuclear site. Additionally, E did not localize with the M or S proteins distant to the perinuclear sites when all three proteins were analyzed at 12 h p.i. (data not shown). At 16 h p.i., and more prominently at 24 h p.i., a large portion of the M protein was visualized throughout the cytoplasm, presumably as virus output increased and virions are being transported out of the cell. In contrast, at the late time points E continued to remain localized primarily in the ERGIC/Golgi region. Only a few small punctate dots were seen outside of these regions, presumably due to the extensive fusion that is characteristic of MHV A59 infected cells at late times after infection (Heald-Sargent and Gallagher, 2012). These results indicate that the E and M proteins colocalize at the ERGIC/Golgi assembly site early during infection; the E proteins remain there at later times as virions and S traffic toward the cell surface.",

To further examine this, cells infected or transiently expressing E were analyzed for surface expression (\nFig. 3). The S and M proteins were monitored in parallel as positive and negative controls, respectively, for surface expression. Two approaches were used to monitor surface expression. First, 17Cl1 cells were infected with wild-type MHV A59 and cell surface proteins were biotinylated at 16 and 18 h p.i. (Fig. 3A). Biotinylated surface proteins were isolated with streptavidin agarose beads. Both surface and intracellular fractions were then analyzed by Western blotting for the viral proteins. As expected, the S protein was detected in both the intracellular (I) and surface (S) fractions, characteristic of a protein that transports through the exocytic pathway (Fig. 3A, top). The M protein was also detected in both fractions at later time points (data not shown), whereas the E protein was detected only in the intracellular fraction at all times, indicating that it was not accessible on the cell surface for biotinylation (Fig. 5A, lower panel).",

The amino end of the M protein (luminal side) was recognized by monoclonal antibody J1.3 in the perinuclear region after cells were permeabilized with TX-100, but not with digitonin, consistent with the orientation of the protein at intracellular membranes and its known localization (Fig. 3B, middle images) (Klumperman et al., 1994, Locker et al., 1992). The S protein was detected inside the cell and also on the cell surface (Fig. 3B, top images). The E protein was detected in the perinuclear region in both TX-100 and digitonin treated cells when probed with antibody 9410 that recognizes the carboxy terminus (Fig. 3B, bottom images). This is consistent with the carboxy tail of the E protein being located on the cytoplasmic side of internal membranes, as suggested previously (Raamsman et al., 2000). No signal was detected on the surface of nonpermeabilized cells with the 9410 antibody (Fig. 3C, lower images). This indicates that the carboxy end of the E protein is not exposed on the cell surface.",

BHK-21 cells were transfected with the pCAGGS vector containing the Strep-tagged E gene. The amino end of the E protein was detected by an antibody that recognizes the Strep tag, but only when cells were permeablized with TX-100 and not when permeabilized with digitonin (Fig. 3C, bottom images). This indicates that the amino end is located inside the lumen and not exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the ERGIC/Golgi membranes.

No signal was observed with either antibody when cells were not permeablized, which shows that indeed the amino end is also not exposed on the cell surface.",

TC tags form hairpin structures that bind small, membrane-permeable fluorescein derivatives such as the fluorescein arsenical hairpin binder Lumio\u2122 Green (FlAsH\u2122) or a variant, resorufin arsenical hairpin binder Lumio\u2122 Red (ReAsH\u2122), a red-shift analog (Gaietta et al., 2002, Griffin et al., 1998). The biarsenicals are fluorescent when they bind to TC tags. We initially confirmed that the tagged E could support VLP formation when the M and TC-tagged E proteins were co-expressed in 293T cells (data not shown). We also confirmed that the TC-tagged E protein localized correctly in the ERGIC/Golgi (Fig. 4). It was noted that the signal from recognition of the TC tag by either LumioTM Green or Red is lower than what is achieved by the high-affinity 9410 antibody that recognizes the carboxy end of the E protein. However, the signal and resolution achieved for the TC tag was strong enough to allow clear localization and monitoring of the protein.",

When MHV E-TC infected 17Cl1 cells were labeled with Lumio\u2122 Red, the red fluorescence colocalized with the signal from the 9410 antibody that recognizes the carboxy end of E (\nFig. 5A). Colocalization with the anti-E antibody demonstrated specificity of the Lumio\u2122 Red staining in the infected cells. The E-TC virus did produce smaller plaques and growth kinetic analysis showed that the virus grew slower, yielding titers that were ~100-fold less than the WT untagged virus by 20 h p.i. (Fig. 5B). Nonetheless, sequencing and the continued presence of the TC tag, as indicated by fluorescence, demonstrated that the E-TC virus was stable through five passages. This indicated that MHV E-TC was replication- and assembly-competent and thus, a good model to study the dynamics of the protein in live cells.",

Cells infected with MHV E-TC were initially viewed by confocal microscopy after addition of Lumio\u2122 Red (\nFig. 7A). Photoexcitation of the Lumio\u2122 Red reagent bound to a TC tag results in release of singlet oxygen, which in turn polymerizes added diaminobenzidine (DAB). The precipitate that forms can be visualized directly by EM following osmimum tetroxide staining. In MHV E-TC virus infected cells a precipitate was visible that colocalized with the Lumio\u2122 Red labeling, as expected in a perinuclear position, consistent with the ERGIC/Golgi localization described earlier (Fig. 5A). When examined by EM the electron-dense precipitate was localized in Golgi stacks (Fig. 7B). In some cells Golgi fragmentation was evident and E was associated with ~20-nm vesicles, apparently derived from the stacks (data not shown).",

Genetic approaches have been used to examine contributions of various conserved residues and domains to gain insight about the function of the protein. Many of the alterations significantly impact virus production and transport out of the cell (Boscarino et al., 2008, Fischer et al., 1998, Kuo and Masters, 2003, Lopez et al., 2008, Ruch and Machamer, 2011, Ye and Hogue, 2007). E proteins from other coronaviruses can substitute for MHV E (Kuo et al., 2007). Recent studies demonstrated that SARS E protein is a virulence factor (DeDiego et al., 2011, DeDiego et al., 2014). Several studies have shown that SARS E protein interacts with cellular proteins, some of which likely participate in the functional roles that the protein plays (Alvarez et al., 2010, Jimenez-Guardeno et al., 2014, Teoh et al., 2010).",

Our confocal imaging, in parallel with a full panel of exocytic pathway cellular markers, clearly shows that MHV E is not in the ER, but is present in both the ERGIC and Golgi, primarily in the cis and medial cisternae of the latter, early during infection. Based on the apparent similar roles that the E proteins play in virus assembly, it stands to reason that they likely share common localization characteristics. IBV and SARS-CoV E proteins were previously reported to localize in the ER and/or Golgi (Corse and Machamer, 2000, Liao et al., 2006, Lim and Liu, 2001, Nal et al., 2005). Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV E colocalizes with ERGIC-53 in infected cells and also when expressed transiently (Nieto-Torres et al., 2011, Teoh et al., 2010). Strong transient expression of SARS-CoV E in the cis-Golgi, but hardly any expression in the ERGIC and trans-Golgi was also recently reported (Cohen et al., 2011, Nieto-Torres et al., 2011, Teoh et al., 2010). We previously showed as well that HA-tagged SARS-CoV E localized in both the ERGIC and Golgi during transient expression (Lopez et al., 2006). Collectively, it can be concluded that coronavirus E proteins are expressed in both ERGIC and Golgi compartments, though the distribution may vary depending on the virus and cell type.",

In addition to surface immunofluorescence, cellular permeabilization by E proteins and whole-cell patch clamp measurement of ion channel activity in cells expressing SARS-CoV E were suggestive of surface expression (Liao et al., 2004, Liao et al., 2006, Madan et al., 2005, Pervushin et al., 2009). We did not detect MHV E on the surface of nonpermeabilized transfected or infected cells. This is consistent with the recent report which clearly demonstrated that SARS-CoV E is not present at the plasma membrane (Nieto-Torres et al., 2011). Our confocal microscopy analysis over a time course following infection strongly illustrates that E remains in its perinuclear location even late during infection. Results from our live-cell and CLEM imaging also support the conclusion that MHV E remains at the site of assembly in ERGIC/Golgi membranes and does not transport to the plasma membrane. Our surface expression results yielded additional information confirming that MHV E assumes an orientation with the amino end located in the lumen and the cytoplasmic tail in the cytoplasm, consistent with the recently described topology of SARS-CoV E (Nieto-Torres et al., 2011). The cytoplasmic tail of MHV E was previously determined to reside in the cytoplasm in infected cells and thus, outside of the virion, but with a FLAG tag placed at the amino end it was suggested that the protein spans the lipid bilayer twice with both the amino and carboxy ends in the cytoplasm (Maeda et al., 2001, Raamsman et al., 2000). Our results clearly show that the amino-terminal Strep tag does not alter the single pass topology with a luminal amino end and cytoplasmic carboxy end in the cellular membranes.",

Its average mobility (M\nf=61%) is similar to what was measured for nsp4 in ER membranes (Hagemeijer et al., 2011). Nsp4 is a nonstructural integral membrane protein that localizes to the ER, but the protein is recruited during infection to replication complex structures that are interconnected with ER membranes, where its mobility (M\nf=33%) is apparently restricted (Hagemeijer et al., 2011). The mobility of GFP tagged N and nsp2, both soluble cytoplasmic proteins, was also analyzed in cells infected with recombinant MHVs expressing the tagged constructs (Verheije et al., 2010, Hagemeijer et al., 2010). The N protein (M\nf=40.4%) is dynamically associated with replication\u2013transcription complexes, whereas nsp2 (M\nf=9.9%) is thought to be immobilized through protein\u2013protein interactions in the complexes in infected cells.",

            "text": "The E protein actually displayed a range of mobilities (M\nf=41\u201387%) at 6 h p.i., the point at which virus assembly is actively ongoing. Several factors may account for the M\nf range. The population of E molecules that are actively involved in assembly maybe associated with other structural proteins or possibly host factors that differently restrict lateral diffusion in membranes. The E protein assembles into oligomeric ion channels that could affect the proteins mobility. Possibly only a fraction of molecules exists as part of a channel at any given time. The E protein is palmitoylated (Boscarino et al., 2008, Lopez et al., 2008). We do not know if all potential cysteine residues are modified at the same time or if possibly the protein undergoes dynamic palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycling during infection. The conserved cysteines are located adjacent to the transmembrane domain, which when palmitoylated may influence interaction of the protein tail with membranes and thus, its mobility. The HA protein of influenza virus is a transmembrane protein that is both palmitoylation and myristoylated. Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) tagged HA exhibits different diffusion coefficients that vary based on the acylation state of the protein. WT HA-YFP has a diffusion coefficient of 0.14 \u03bcm/s2 while a non-acylated mutant has a diffusion coefficient of 0.30 \u03bcm/s2. The acylation greatly reduces the mobility of the protein (Engel et al., 2010). Depending on the number of sites that are palmitoylated, this may affect the mobility of E molecules. If E plays a role in membrane curvature or in scission, lateral movement of the protein in membranes at the site of assembly could facilitate the budding process. This might also contribute to the range of mobilities observed in this study.",

VLPs were assembled with chimeric N and S proteins containing a fluorescent protein (cyan \u2013 eCFP or green \u2013 eGFP) tag fused at their carboxy termini, but similarly tagged M protein could not be incorporated. Data was not shown, but the authors indicated that the E protein did not tolerate addition of the large fluorescent protein tags (Siu et al., 2008). Our study highlights the potential utility and tolerance of the smaller TC tag since we were able to generate a recombinant virus with the tag fused to the carboxy end of E. The recombinant virus produced smaller plaques and reached titers of only 1\u00d7106\n PFU/ml, compared with wild-type MHV A59 that generally yields titers in the range of 1\u00d7107\u20131\u00d7108\n PFU/ml. Nonetheless, virus stability over multiple passages provides the opportunity to use the tagged virus for live cell studies. When the E gene is deleted or knocked out from MHV a small plaque phenotype and titers at least three orders of magnitude lower than the wild-type virus are produced (Kuo et al., 2007, Kuo and Masters, 2003). Thus, the virus with the TC-tagged E grows better than the E-null virus.",

More extensive and higher resolution views of ultrastructural changes that occur during replication and assembly were recently described (Ulasli et al., 2010). Three membranous structures, including large virion-containing vacuoles (LVCVs), tubular bodies (TBs) and cubic membrane structures (CMSs), were associated with virus assembly/release. The E protein was present with two of these structures, the LVCVs that are derived from ERGIC/Golgi membranes and TBs thought to form late in infection as a result of excess protein self-aggregation (Raamsman et al., 2000, Ulasli et al., 2010). The latter are thought to be equivalent to previously described smooth tubular membranous structures that are induced by E protein expression late during coronavirus infection (Raamsman et al., 2000). During the time frame in which our CLEM studies were conducted, we did not detect these tubular structures. It is possible that the lower yield of the E-TC virus might account for this. We did find E associated with Golgi cisternae and in some cells association with Golgi fragmentation was noted. Golgi fragmentation has been observed by confocal microscopy in cells infected with MHV or TGEV and also when IBV E was overexpressed (Lavi et al., 1996, Ortego et al., 2007, Ruch and Machamer, 2011, Ulasli et al., 2010). Golgi disruption was not observed in cells infected with a recombinant TGEV lacking the E gene, but fragmentation occurred when E was provided in trans, thus providing strong support for contribution of the protein to this process (Ortego et al., 2007). Our CLEM results illustrate the potential to follow E during infection and to monitor changes at the ultrastructural level that are associated with the protein, a direction that will be pursued further in future studies.",

            "text": "The accumulation of E in ERGIC/Golgi membranes and the fact that only a few molecules are incorporated into virions suggest that E likely provides a function(s) that is peripheral to or limited at most in the area where virion particles bud. Lack of E trafficking to the cell surface during infection lends additional support for the protein\u05f3s participation in virus assembly and morphogenesis and possible other roles during infection from its position in the internal membranes. At these membranes E may through its ion channel transport of cations directly influence the immediate microenvironment in the ERGIC lumen by alteration of Na+ or K+ or other ion concentrations that could in turn result in luminal pH changes that are balanced by activation of vacuolar H+ATPase. The ERGIC does contain an active H+ ATPase that has been suggested to be possibly involved in directional transport and concentration of cargo molecules (Ying et al., 2000). A second, previously suggested, possibility is that E plays a role in helping mediate membrane curvature or scission (Vennema et al., 1996). Influenza M2, a well characterized multifunctional small integral membrane protein with proton-selective ion channel activity, plays a significant role in entry during infection, but it is also involved in virus assembly (Chen et al., 2008, Iwatsuki-Horimoto et al., 2006, McCown and Pekosz, 2006, Pinto and Lamb, 2006). Recently M2 was shown to mediate membrane curvature and scission during budding (Rossman et al., 2010). Coronavirus E proteins could play a similar role. Thirdly, coronavirus E proteins may through interactions with host proteins facilitate virus budding or vesicular transport. A large number of host proteins copurify with SARS virions and recently host and viral proteins that interact with E were identified (Alvarez et al., 2010, Neuman et al., 2008, Teoh et al., 2010). Finally, E ion channel activity at internal membranes may result in signaling that activates ion channel activity at the cell surface. While the latter is only speculative at this point, measurement of ion channel activity at the surface of cells expressing SARS-CoV E might reflect a response to such signaling and while such activity might be less likely to play a role in virus assembly and transport of LVCVs, such activity could impact a role of the protein as a virulence factor during infection (DeDiego et al., 2007, DeDiego et al., 2008, Pervushin et al., 2009, Teoh et al., 2010). SARS-CoV lacking the E gene is attenuated in animal models, thus the protein, at least for this virus, is a virulence factor (DeDiego et al., 2007, DeDiego et al., 2008, Netland et al., 2010). Recent results indicate that ion channel activity is an important contributor to virulence (DeDiego et al., 2014, Nieto-Torres et al., 2011). Thus, there are a large number of potential functions for the E protein which makes it an attractive target for antiviral therapeutic development.",
