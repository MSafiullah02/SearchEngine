In the absence of enzyme, only the 67-kDa substrate and a minor protein, probably resulting from a premature termination event, were detected. When the PLP-1 was included, a processed form of the substrate appeared with the substrate containing a Gly residue at position 108, with the expected size of the Cterminal cleavage product generated after the release of the N-terminal p9 protein, but not with the substrate presenting an Asp residue at the same position. These results indicated that mutations at nucleotide 637 affected the PLP-1-mediated N-terminal polyprotein cleavage in vitro. Because predicted cleaving mutations were required for virus recovery, we propose a critical role of this processing event for viral replication. In contrast, the minigenomes selected predicted noncleaving mutations, suggesting that the processing of the minigenome-encoded fusion protein led to the generation of pp1a products that interfere with minigenome amplification. Further analysis will be required to assign specific functions to the N-terminal replicase proteins in TGEV replication. ",
