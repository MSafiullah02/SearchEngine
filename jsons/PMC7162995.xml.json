For the safety of health personnel from droplet-transmitted infections, continuous National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-approved (N95) respirator use showed superior protection than targeted N95 respirator use, surgical mask use, or usual mask-wearing practices [11]. In a set of personal protection guidelines for health personnel responding to the COVID-19 epidemic published by Chinese physicians, it was recommended that personal protective equipment of various levels should be used as appropriate in multiple distinct zones. Those guidelines also indicated the specific devices that health personnel should use [12]. Therefore, ensuring an adequate supply of these devices is essential for the safety of health personnel. Antiseptic or safety techniques are dealt with in undergraduate coursework at medical schools and schools for other health professionals. For example, training on reducing the rates of needlestick or sharp injuries is necessary [13]. If health personnel follow the principles of safety and antiseptic techniques, the risk of nosocomial viral infections from patients will be lowered. For example, the methods to collect the specimen from the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and sputum were presented in Supplement 1.",

The high physical workload is difficult to alleviate due to the shortage of health personnel able to participate in the urgent response to the epidemic. The only solutions may be regular exercise, stretching, and balanced meals. The psychological stress experienced by health personnel may not yet be visible. Some personnel do not leave the hospital in order to have time to rest or due to their fear of potentially transmitting the infection to their family members if they become infected. Regular testing of health personnel for COVID-19 is required, even when they have no symptoms or signs of the disease. When health personnel have the time to rest during patient care, psychological support should be provided for them. Furthermore, to relieve their physical and psychological stress, ongoing communication and mutual encouragement among health personnel should be encouraged.",
