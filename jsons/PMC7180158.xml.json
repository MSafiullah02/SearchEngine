Up to February 25, 2020, the total accumulated number of infected patients in China is 78,064 (data only from mainland China). The number of new cases per day has not increased in the past 9 days. The total accumulated number of people who were in close contact with an infected person is 647,406. Thus, by simply dividing the number of infected persons by the number of contacted persons, the total infection rate is only 12%, considerably lower than expected. Prior expectation has been much higher, based on multiple infectious routes [3], [4]. Using our formula, the results indicate that the current infectious rate is even lower than the rate based on the total numbers (see Fig. 1A). The infectious rate in Hubei province is currently around 4%, although previously the rate was as high as 39%. On average, the infectious rate overall in China is about 4%, while in Hubei it is 10%. In the rest of the country, it is 0.46%. Among the inpatients, the rate in serious medical condition ranges from 10% to 30% (see Fig. 1B), while it averages at 18% in China, 19% in Hubei, and 13% in the rest of country (except Hubei). Based on the estimated death rate, on January 22, there should be a total of 150 to 300 inpatients (see Fig. 5C). Based on the rate of patients who are severely ill among all patients, on January 2, there should be 216 to 315 patients. Based on the effective infection rate and based on the assumption of one week or 14 days from close contact to the onset of symptoms, there might be 2,160 to 68,478 people who were infected around December 20, 2019. If we believe the epidemic doubling time is approximately 6 days, the initial infection source may date back to as early as November or October 2019.",
