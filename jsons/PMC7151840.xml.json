In an age when both noninvasive and minimally invasive approaches and techniques have increased, it is important to revisit the role of the biopsy in the diagnosis of infection (Table 2-1\n). Isolating microorganisms in the microbiology laboratory is a sensitive and accurate approach to their identification, but it has several important limitations. First, it cannot distinguish infection from colonization, nor can it ascertain the significance of the isolated organism. Only the presence of an organism in situ, together with an expected inflammatory response by the host, constitutes acceptable evidence of its role in infection.",

Treatment decisions that do not take into account the host response and dominating organisms will tend to favor the production of increasingly antibiotic-resistant isolates and may potentially compromise public health. This is only one of several compelling reasons to consider diagnostic biopsies in patients with infections in situations that do not readily yield to noninvasive approaches.",

In these responses, neutrophils predominate, leading to pus formation. They are evoked primarily by bacteria, although viruses and fungi can also elicit them (Fig. 2-1\n).2.\nNecrotizing inflammation. Tissue necrosis can occur in several forms. In certain infections, such as those caused by amebas or gram-negative bacteria, liquefactive necrosis is frequently seen (Fig. 2-2\n). Other forms, such as ischemic, mummefactive, and caseous necrosis, are often seen in mycobacterial and fungal infections.3.\nGranulomatous inflammation. This response is characterized by the presence of epithelioid macrophages with multikaryon (giant cell) formation. It appears to reflect cell-mediated immunity to poorly catabolized antigens and is evoked by mycobacteria, fungi, and parasites (Fig. 2-3\n).4.\nHistiocytic inflammation. These responses are characterized primarily by the presence of foamy macrophages and are a prominent component of infections caused by Legionella, Rhodococcus, Calymmatobacterium, Leishmania, and T. whippelii (Fig. 2-4\n). In patients who are severely immunocompromised, organisms that normally elicit granulomatous inflammation may instead evoke histiocytic infiltrates.5.\nEosinophilic inflammation. This is seen in response to multicellular parasites and certain fungi (Fig. 2-5\n).6.\nCytopathic changes. Although this is not properly a type of inflammation, cytopathic changes do reflect a response to viral infection. Nuclear inclusions are part of the response to DNA viruses, whereas cytologic inclusions are seen with some RNA and DNA viral infections, such as cytomegalovirus (Fig. 2-6\n).7.\nNull responses. In the setting of profound immunosuppression, one may not see inflammation; only the uninhibited growth of microorganisms is apparent (Fig. 2-7\n).\n",

There is some controversy among experts as to whether these stains are equally efficacious in the identification of certain organisms, such as Bartonella spp., but in general they yield comparable results. In theory, all eubacteria, including mycobacteria, will stain positively with silver impregnation. However, in our experience, they do not do so reliably, and this approach cannot be recommended as a screening tool. In general, bacteria are enhanced both colorimetrically and in size by the deposition of silver salts on their cell walls, making them easier to identify but at times causing confusion in interpretation. Background staining presents a problem in interpretation, but the morphologic regularity of eubacteria usually allows for accurate identification, once experience has been established with the technique.",

(\u00d7200) DNA was isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue and amplified with primers to the HSP65 gene, showing positive bands for the MTb sample (E, lane 1) and the MAC sample (E, lane 2). An MTb-specific gene polymerase chain reaction assay (IS6110 gene) reveals a band only with MTb (E, lane 4). Water-only control lanes show no band in either reaction (E, lanes 3 and 6). The HSP65 gene products were subject to DNA sequencing with the bacterial sequence from the MTb sample in F and from the MAC in G.
