A rapid defeat of the pandemic requires carrying out on the population a mass screening, able to separate positive from negative cases. Such a cleaning will free a flow of productive population. The current rate and cost of testing, performed with the common PCR (polymerase chain reaction) method and with the available resources, is forcing a selection of the subjects to be tested. Indeed, each one must be examined individually at the cost of precious time. Moreover, the exclusion of potentially positive individuals from screening induces health risks, a broad slowdown in the effort to curb the viral spread, and the consequent mortality rates. We present a new procedure, the Purified by Unified Resampling of Infected Multitudes, in short Purim, able to untangle any massive candidate sample with inexpensive screening, through the crosscorrelated analysis of the joint speciments. This procedure can reveal and detect most negative patients and in most cases discover the identity of the few positives already in the first or few secondary tests. We investigate the the two-dimensional correlation case in function of the infection probability. The multi-dimensional topology, the scaled Purim procedure are also considered. Extensive Purim tests may measure and weight the degree of epidemic: their outcome may identify focal regions in the early stages. Assuming hundreds or thousand subjects, the saving both in time and in cost will be remarkable. Purim may be able to filter scheduled flights, scholar acceptance, popular international event participants. The optimal extension of Purim outcome is growing as the inverse of the epidemia expansion. Therefore, the earlier, the better.",

There is no other known cheap and fast methods to test a large population at once. Here we suggest a joint and unified unique test or a mixed sub-groups test array (for instance by gingival exudate), united into several independent ones, whose cross checked results might discover in an rapid and economic way the main infected cases.

Moreover, the screening procedure of a large population to avoid the spreading of the infection should detect any suspect case. The highlighting of suspect cases that are not actually positive to nCoV would increase the cost of the screening but won't reduce its effectiveness. Most virus tests are individual, often testing in a blind and costly way wide numbers of the population. We believe that such single individual test politics in present pandemic stage is time consuming, costly and unable to face the fast virus growth and the largest population screening. Moreover, the foreseen return of secondary waves of infection might require iterative or permanent filter of travelers from abroad. Quick and massive tests are needed. The procedure remind somehow the procedure to disentangle a scrambled card deck that is not well shuffled [9] .

The sub-groups are just made by the horizontal and by the vertical column array = 2 \u00b7 N = 18 sample of patients. Any subgroup test (composed by N = 9 individuals each) is mixed and united with the all N = 9 individual saliva. Their 2 \u00b7 N array results are later cross-checked. False positive cases might also arise as a \"mirror or shadows\" effect. In a first case on the left, the single positive case may be immediately identify as an unique True positive case. Remaining candidates are negative. Al least ((81 \u2212 (18 + 1)/81) = 79% doubled checked negative. In the second and in the third arrays the presence of two or three True positive infect subjects produce more False positive born by the \"mirror or shadows\" SG False intersections. Such overabundance may be disentangled by additional, individual tests for the few suspect candidates.",

The absence of any infected, the negative case, will free the N ALL suspect candidates. In particular, in an airport, they may fly abroad. On the contrary, if the test offer a positive result, at least one or even more components of the group must be infected.

It may be also reduced to a quadratic group with a few remnants candidates. This secondary procedure for an optimal fragmentation of N ALL into two comparable squared and to a few remnants is irrelevant here and it might be discussed elsewhere. Anyway, one may also find an approximation N ALL = N 2 (\u00b1M) where M is the smallest integer number needed to fill the N 2 square matrix. In such a case one may build such an square array either with N ALL = N 2 and with a few empty (M) places, in both rows and in columns.

As in the bidimensional case, this may be reached by dividing the whole number N ALL in comparable sub cubic numbers or by to located the surplus candidate into few empty cells in such a larger cubic array location. The different alternative to optimize N ALL into cubic sizes are irrelevant here. Each person is tagged by its H i , horizontal, V i , vertical, L i , longitudinal position inside the ideal cubic cell volume. For instance a sample of N ALL = N 3 = 216 passengers are tagged by a 3D array made by 6 3 cubic side cell structure as shown in Fig. 6 . The easy way to act within a planar Purim procedure in 3D cells (candidates) array is based on the construction of 3 \u00b7 N planar sub-groups associated to all the three possible planes: HV i , HL j , LV k . (i,j,k are bounded within N cube size). Each of the planar array is made by N 2 sub-group components united by their test. In present example each planar sub-group contains N 2 = 36 patients tests united. These sub groups (3 \u00b7 6) are organized and tested independently. Therefore one needs only a total of 3 \u00b7 6 = 18 test to intersect to discover potential (True and False) infected cases and not N ALL = N 3 = 216. In the presence of an unique positive person in the whole cube sample its planar intersections may define just a single cell candidate, as shown in Fig. 6 left side correlated to the upper figure. Such a unique identification (one True) is well defined. In the very diluted sample this procedure is extremely effective and economic. The ratio between 3 \u00b7 N and N 3 test is 3/N 2 . Therefore very inexpensive. In the present N ALL = 216 case the cost is below 10%. There are of course mirror effects due to many parasite F False intersections, even more than in previous bi-dimensional case. As shown in the zoomed side in Fig. 6 the 2 True positive cell location, defining a complete inner mini-cube, they produce 6 additional planar intersections whose corner are forming 6 False or virtual infected cases by the other two T True infected presence. Indeed the total intersections of three independent planar sub-group are the exactly the corners of a cube, that are in a total of 8. Figure 6 : The 3D array distribution of the candidates in a cell array 6 3 tagged by horizontal, Vertical and Longitudinal labels. For sake of simplicity in upward figure, the array cells are shown with the colored plane sections that are crossing and selecting an inner central True infected case. The inner detection by the independent 3 sub-planar-groups is shown on the left side. Moreover, as shown in the right side, the presence of just 2 True infect cases creates six plane intersection forming 2 3 cubic vertex: 2N T + 6N F = 8. Therefore a larger growth of False suspected cases. The geometry is zoomed in the right corner to show the cubic structure. This False growth imply a wider over-estimation respect to the bi-dimensional cases.",

Let us imagine a whole clustered group (hundreds or thousands persons), whose mixed test are jointed and unified, as a single subject, whose collective test is either a positive or negative one. Such a positive clustered group would contain at least an infected person. Now, let us imagine a larger scale array, made by such clustered groups, each individually located in a square matrix, of such clustered groups. Each of those sub-group as a whole may be tagged as positive or negative. For example, let us imagine that the clustered groups are the school classes of 25 students each.

Yet, this is limited by the probability of each individual being infected, as shown in Fig. 2 . Another limit is due to the dilution of the biological sample by mixing of the positive ones with the negative ones in the same sub-group. This limit depends on both the concentration of the nCoV in the samples collected from infected people and on the limit of detection (LoD) of the testing technology. No specific data on the actual LoD is available in the open literature. The CDC reports [10] a limit for common RT-PCR lies between 10 0.0 and 10 0.5 RNA copies \u00b5L. Yet no data are available on the concentration of RNA copies in the specimens of infected people. On the other hand, authors from China [11, 12] report relevant negative PCR tests in symptomatic patients, even with repeated tests. Nonetheless, a dilution between 10 to 100 would be probably acceptable leading to the opportunity for rapid testing of clusters between 100 and 10,000 people with reduction of number of laboratory tests between 80% and 98%. In a limited time scenario, in which the number of people tested is limited by the availability of laboratory time, this means that the application of the proposed method will allow to increase the number of tested people between 5 times and 50 times in comparison to standard one-by-one testing.",

The ability to distinguish and filtering positive from negative subjects may free a steady component of the population into the economy life, while holding the rest of the positive or untested citizens in a restrictive quarantine. The usual one-test to each patient in present international CoVid-19 pandemia is exhausting both in the economy and in time prospective. A fast and economic is based on the Purim procedure (Purified by Unified Resampling of Infected Multitudes): the collective array sub-group tests whose crosschecked results may rapidly intersect and disentangle the real and the few suspect positive patients. For a flight or a ship embark procedure, respectively of 10 2 \u221210 4 individuals passengers the present Purim strategy may cost about (20%) up to (2%) of the whole sample test, both in cost and in time. In a diluted < 1% infected population stages these procedure might require only a negligible additional tests to better identify the real True positive infected passengers, from the few possible False ones. In general such Purim test will free and guarantee the majority of the passengers as being negative by a double-checked subgroup test. The Purim application in the present medical subjects it may avoid the presence of infected doctors at the hospital care. The same Purim purification may be applied to classes or to schools leading, step by step, to a fast reopening of the education system. For an ideal national population, as large as the Italian one of 6 \u00b7 10 7 candidates, the fragmentation of the whole population into 6 \u00b7 10 3 sub group, each made by N ALL = 10 4 citizens, may be achieved by 2 \u00b7 N 2 , just 2 hundreds, sub test each, within a realistic goal: minor city areas may be tested step by step and they may be let free in life while positive identified subjects may be better guaranteed in their medical and quarantine needs. This procedure would cost nearly 2 \u2212 3% of the individual national population test, with possibly dozens of billions of euro saving expenses. The procedure might be naturally extended in the international arena, where the pandemia is just at the earliest stages, with more profit and success.",

On the left the overall trend, on the right a zoom on a specific area. The usual procedure involves a single test for each individual: if the individuals are N All , then N All tests are performed. The Purim procedure, as explained in the text, provides for the clustering of individual tests in groups with N = N All 1/2 individuals each. It also prescribes to put the sample of each individual in D (here equal to two) groups with the additional condition that each pair of individuals can be present simultaneously in only one group. We define T s the number of tests saved as T s = N 2 \u2212 2N \u2212 N p , N p is the average number of individuals who tested positive. The figure shows, by a MonteCarlo the best trend of the saved test fraction T s /N All as a function of the probability of infection P i and for different values of N All . The figure point out that the best efficency is obtained with a number of subgroups N which depends in a good approximation (inversely) on the probability of the infection.",
