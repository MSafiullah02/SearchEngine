Expression by 2 TMPRSS2 gene primers could only be found in 1 out of 3 pterygium cell lines, but not in any conjunctival cells. Compared with the lung A549 cells, similar expression was noted in conjunctival and pterygium cells. In addition, mouse cornea had comparable expression of Tmprss2 gene and lower but prominent Ace2 gene expression compared with the lung tissue. Conclusion Considering the necessity of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection, our results suggest that conjunctiva would be less likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, whereas pterygium possesses some possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. With high and consistent expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 in cornea, cornea rather than conjunctiva has higher potential to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Precaution is necessary to prevent possible SARS-CoV-2 infection through ocular surface in clinical practice.",

Genomic analysis on the RNA samples extracted from the bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid of the pneumonia patients by Illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing identified the viral contigs matched to the genome of lineage B of the genus betacoronavirus and with 85% identity to the genome of a bat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZC45, MG772933.1) [2] , indicating that this coronavirus disease is caused by a novel SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-resembled virus (SARS-CoV-2). Target cell infection by SARS-CoV is mediated by the spike protein of coronavirus and the host cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [3] . Similarly, a recent study suggests that the cellular entry by SARS-CoV-2 also depends on ACE2 as well as type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) [4] . This implies that the identification of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in human tissues can predict the potential infected cells and their respective influences in COVID-19 patients.",

In contrast, conjunctivitis was suggested as a presymptomatic sign before the onset of COVID-19, possibly by the exposure of infectious droplets without proper protection of goggles [7] . Critically, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in tears and conjunctival secretions from a COVID-19 patient with conjunctivitis by RT-PCR [8] . However, whether SARS-CoV-2 could infect human conjunctival cells and cause conjunctivitis still remain elusive. Herein, this study aimed to determine the expressions of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and serine protease TMPRSS2 genes in human and mouse ocular cells and tissues. Their expressions were also compared with the expressions in other tissue cells.",

Human primary conjunctival and pterygium cell lines have been established and characterized as previously described [9, 10] . Briefly, full-length primary pterygium and conjunctiva tissues, freshly collected from surgical removal, were first digested with 50 \u03bcg/ml dispase (Gibco\u00ae, Rockville, MD) and 100 mM D-sorbitol (Sigma-Aldrich) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco\u00ae) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, and further dissociated into single cells by 0.05% trypsin at 37\u00b0C for 5 min with the cell strainer (40 \u03bcm, Nunc TM ). The isolated cells were cultured in advanced DMEM medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco\u00ae) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco\u00ae) in 5% CO 2 incubator at 37\u00b0C.

It is believed that person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 is mainly due to the infection by SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory droplets and close contact [20] . The infection and cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 are mediated by the spike glycoprotein of coronavirus and the host cellular SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 [4, 21] . In addition to ACE2, TMPRSS2 is required to promote SARS-CoV entry by ACE2 cleavage to promote viral uptake and SARS-CoV spike protein cleavage to activates the spike protein for membrane fusion [22] . Therefore, understanding the coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 can predict the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human system.",

Considering the necessity of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection, our results suggest that conjunctiva would be less likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, whereas pterygium possesses some possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the contrary, consistent expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes can be found in endothelial cells HUVEC, epidermal keratinocytes HaCaT, and lung epithelial carcinoma cells A549, indicating that lung, skin, and blood capillaries are the potential sites with SARS-CoV-2 infection. To expand our understanding of the possible tissues influenced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, we determined the expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 genes in mouse tissues (Fig. 3) . We report the expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 genes in mouse cornea tissue, but not in iris, lens, retina, and optic nerve. Our results indicated that cornea could be a susceptible site for SARS-CoV-2 infection as their expressions in cornea are comparable to that in lung tissue (Fig. 4) . Apart from cornea, we found expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 genes in lung, liver, kidney, and brain.

Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed. The expression of (a) Ace2 and (b) Tmprss2 genes was determined by SYBR green polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with 2 primers for each gene. Housekeeping \u03b2-actin gene Actb was used for normalization. Relative expression levels (\u0394Ct) of different mouse tissues were compared with that of mouse lung tissue. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. which lack of Tmprss2 reduces the severity of lung pathology after infection by SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV [38] . In addition to the coronavirus spike protein, TMPRSS2 is also the major protease for the cleavage of the influenza virus surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin, which is prerequisite for membrane fusion and virus infectivity [29] . Apart from TMPRSS2, membrane alanyl aminopeptidase (ANPEP), dipeptidyl peptidase 4, and glutamyl aminopeptidase have been suggested as the candidate coreceptors for ACE2 [23] . The roles and mechanisms of these coreceptor peptidases in SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the possible therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 warrant further investigations.",
