Abdominocentesis 1 week prior to presentation by the referring veterinarian identified a fluid having a specific gravity of 1.022, proteins of 30 g/l, 4000 cells/\u03bcl (60% mature neutrophils, 20% mesothelial cells, 20% lymphocytes, macrophages). Bacterial culture of the fluid was sterile, and a serum antibody titre for coronavirus was negative. Treatment with enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg, once daily) did not improve the condition. The cat was regularly vaccinated and fed a commercial maintenance diet containing beef as source for animal proteins.",

            "text": "This report shows a rare case of pansteatitis in a cat with associated severe hypocalcaemia. In felines, pansteatitis is an uncommon diagnosis and in many cases diets rich in unsaturated fatty acids relative to vitamin E are considered the cause (Watson et al., 1973, Flecknell and Gruffydd-Jones, 1978, Tidholm et al., 1996, Niza et al., 2003). Indeed, commercial diets containing abundant amounts of unsaturated fatty acids capable of inducing oxidative stress such as red tuna, cod and other fishes are common (Tidholm et al 1996). The role of unsaturated fatty acids in the development of pansteatitis was confirmed by Cordy in 1954. In this study the administration of a commercial food containing 90% fish caused the disease in kittens. Supplementation with alpha-tocopherol prevented development of the pansteatitis (Cordy 1954). In the present cat a dietetic factor, though not completely excluded, seems a less probable cause as a balanced commercial maintenance diet without fish and with standard contents of vitamin E was administered. Aside from nutritional factors, pansteatitis in cats is rarely described with other conditions, such as abdominal injury (Suter and Olsson, 1969, Aydin et al., 2002), pancreatitis (Suter and Olsson, 1969, Ryan and Howard, 1981) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Fabbrini et al 2005), all of which can be excluded in our cat. As in the present case, many cats with pansteatitis are brought to the veterinarian because of non-specific signs, like progressive anorexia and lethargy (Tidholm et al 1996). Less frequently, skin nodules due to concomitant involvement of the subcutaneous fat are first observed (Fabbrini et al 2005). On physical examination cats are often febrile and manifest abdominal pain during palpation. Haematology reveals variable leukocytosis and blood chemistry is unremarkable (Niza et al., 2003, Fabbrini et al., 2005), although results of complete profiles also including electrolytes have not been reported. The gross anatomy of adipose tissue in pansteatitis appears firm, granular, white-yellow and opaque (Watson et al., 1973, Tidholm et al., 1996), similar to our case. In some cats, the diseased fat may be also interspersed with liquefied adipose tissue having an orange-brown colour (Fabbrini et al 2005). On microscopic examination, fat drops within adipocytes become finely granular, cell membranes loose their definition and a mixture of acute and chronic inflammatory infiltrates, with macrophages being predominant, is evident (Watson et al., 1973, Tidholm et al., 1996, Niza et al., 2003). Tissue mineralisations may be found, though uncommonly (Watson et al 1973). Independent from the triggering factor, the pathogenesis of pansteatitis follows a common pathway. Thus, any cause damaging adipocytes to a certain degree can provoke the release of stored lipases and initiate hydrolysis of glycerol from fatty acids (Ribelin and Deeds 1960). Then, free saturated fatty acids, especially those with long chains, more easily crystallise and induce chemical trauma and the activation of a mild and chronic inflammatory response that is responsible for the amplification and perpetuation of the fat disorder. Free fatty acids may also bind to calcium ions to form insoluble soaps (Ribelin and Deeds 1960).",

Concomitant total and ionised hypocalcaemia in cats is most frequently identified with pancreatitis (Kimmel et al 2001) and diabetic ketoacidosis (Bruskiewicz et al 1997). Uncommon causes are preparturient hypocalcaemia (Fascetti and Hickman 1999), hypoparathyroidism (Peterson et al 1991), vitamin D-dependent rickets (Schreiner and Nagode 2003), and nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism (Tomsa et al 1999). Although an association between pansteatitis and low calcium levels in cats has not been reported so far, in the present case there was most likely a cause-and-effect relationship between the massive fat disorder and the severe hypocalcaemia. Given that upon histopathological examination crystals were found through the fat tissue, we hypothesise that calcium soap formation within necrotic adipocytes represented one leading factor by which calcium could be trapped. Indeed, in a human with fat necrosis owing to pancreatic fistula, severe hypocalcaemia was reported and shown to be caused by the formation of calcium soaps in the omentum. Coupled measurement of serum and abdominal fluid calcium was used to demonstrate the contribution of saponification to the pathogenesis of hypocalcaemia. The given explanation was that calcium soaps are not easily reabsorbed into the circulation therefore increasing the relative concentration of the electrolyte in the abdomen (Stewart et al 1986). Alternatively, diffuse fat necrosis and the accompanying inflammation might have increased cellular permeability, leading to a calcium shift into the intracellular compartment. A similar mechanism is demonstrated in the pathogenesis of hypocalcaemia in dogs with inflammatory conditions such as pancreatitis and sepsis (Bhattacharya et al., 1985, Steinhorn et al., 1990). Finally, inflammation and increased vascular permeability could have also contributed by causing sequestration of albumin into the third-space with subsequent reduction of the bound calcium fraction. However, this possibility does not explain why the ionised calcium was also severely reduced.",
