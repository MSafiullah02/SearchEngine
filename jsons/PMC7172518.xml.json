Most testing algorithms include universal screening assays for influenza A virus and, in case of positive results, type-specific differentiation by separate assays.3, 4 Due to the cumbersome work flow and high costs, multiplex assays have been proposed that can simultaneously screen for A/H1N1v and the former seasonal viruses.5 However, multiplexing of PCR reactions generally reduces their sensitivity and reliability. In addition, these assays have so far not been available in a uniform, quality-controlled, and ready-to-use format that can easily be adopted by clinical laboratories.",

In a second step the assay was transformed into a commercially available, homogenous test kit format and evaluated on a comprehensive panel of clinical specimens. The commercial assay used the same oligonucleotides as the in-house version and included an internal control system to monitor possible inhibitory substances or procedural failures.",

This commercial assay contained 10 \u03bcl RNA sample in a total reaction volume of 25 \u03bcl. An internal heterologous control system was included to monitor possible inhibitory effects of the sample matrix. It comprises an exogenously spiked RNA at low copy numbers.

PCR efficiency was calculated to be 1.8 for A/H1N1v, 1.9 for A/H1N1 and 1.9 for A/H3N2, respectively according to the PCR amplification formula E\n = 10(1/slope); E being the PCR efficiency. Next in vitro transcribed RNA was used to determine the limit of detection (LOD) using probit analysis.3 Replicate testing of each analyte concentration yielded a 95% LOD of 2149 [95% CI 1506\u20135170], 1323 [95% CI 881\u20133875] and 2858 [95% CI 1926\u20136852] RNA copies/ml for influenza A/H1N1v, seasonal influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2, respectively (Fig. 2\n). To assess the LOD with whole virion cell culture supernatants containing plaque-quantified influenza A virus were spiked at different concentrations into universal transport medium and processed as described above. The 95% LOD was 0.04 [95% CI 0.03\u20130.1], 0.5 [95% CI 0.4\u20131.7] and 0.5 [95% CI 0.4\u20131.3] PFU/ml for A/H1N1v, A/H1N1 and A/H3N2, respectively (Fig. 2). No cross reactivity was observed on a panel of clinical samples containing respiratory viruses other than influenza A virus. Another 20 respiratory samples which tested negative by PCR for respiratory viruses yielded no positive results in the in-house assay. In addition 22 A/H1N1v and 27 seasonal influenza A virus containing original patient samples were correctly identified (Table 2\n). In both influenza A virus panels a range of different RNA target concentrations was used with cycle threshold (C\nt) values from 21.7 to >40. Accordingly 55 stored influenza A virus positive patient samples including 20 A/H1N1v samples yielded positive results by the in-house assay.",

A 95% LOD of 380 [95% CI 285\u2013998], 586 [95% CI 427\u20131300] and 1399 [95% CI 1006\u20132831] RNA copies/ml for influenza A/H1N1v, seasonal influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 was determined, respectively. A panel of different influenza A virus subtypes including swine A/H1N1 and A/H1N2 yielded no fluorescent signal by the A/H1N1v-specific probe but was positive by the universal influenza A virus probe. Furthermore all 27 seasonal influenza A and 22 A/H1N1v positive samples were correctly identified by the RealStar assay (Table 2). Similar to the in-house version even low concentrated samples were detectable. Of note, C\nt values obtained by the RealStar kit were in general lower than those obtained by the in-house version and the reference assays which might in part reflect the higher sample input volume of the kit. Finally, 126 A/H1N1v positive patient samples were re-evaluated by the RealStar kit and all yielded concordant results.7\nC\nt values for the A/H1N1v specific RT-PCR ranged from 22.5 to 42 (mean 32.8) and for the RealStar kit from 17.9 to 38.5 (mean 27.4), respectively (p\n < 0.0001, paired t-test). The internal control yielded a valid reaction in 126/126 samples demonstrating the robustness of the assay.",

Analytical sensitivity of the in-house version was comparable to published singleplex RT-PCR assays.3, 8 For the first time the LOD for each of the contemporary human influenza A viruses was thoroughly assessed from a technical standpoint. In addition we describe the evaluation of one of the first commercial test kits specifically designed to meet the demands of the current pandemic. The RealStar kit rendered to be even more sensitive than the in-house assay most likely attributed to the higher sample input volume and equally specific. Particularly on a panel of original A/H1N1v patient samples the RealStar kit showed superior performance to a widely used real-time RT-PCR.3 Detection of low concentrated samples may become important to, e.g. monitor virus concentrations in patients treated with oseltamivir.9\n",
