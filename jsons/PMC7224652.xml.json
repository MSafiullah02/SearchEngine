(Murrell et al., 2011) Historically males overwhelmingly predominated the field of medicine and surgery to such an extent that during my medical school years there was only a \u201cdoctors\u2019 changing room\u201d and \u201cnurses\u2019 changing room\u201d on the operating room floor; the assumption was that all physicians were men and all nurses were women. However, as of 2015, more than 47% of dermatologists were women compared to less than 7% in the 1970\u2019s when I was in training. (Shinohara, 2019) Now that more than 64% of dermatology residents are women, it is clearly time to become fully committed to leveling inequalities between men and women in dermatology and to treating new parents with respect and humanity.",

Three years later, in 1981, I gave birth to our daughter at 2AM, was required to see an in-patient consultation at 7 AM which I did in my hospital gown and subsequently signed out my dermatopathology slides that same day; my dermatopathology staff wheeled my microscope to my hospital room in the maternity ward. (Grant-Kels, 2015 Feb 18). A few weeks after my daughter was born, I happened to pass the Dean of the School of Medicine in the hospital lobby. He stopped me and asked me: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to have any more children, are you?\u201d to which I answered: \u201cWhat do you care? I did not take a minute off from work!\u201d",

In my opinion, it is time for there to be a national agreed upon policy.

(Stack et al., 2018) The average maternity leave was reported to be 8.4 weeks (which was made up of 6 weeks of maternity plus vacation time plus sick time). Many women reported only taking 6 weeks off that they cobbled together from vacation time and sick time. (Magudia et al., 2018, Stack et al., 2018) The women reported that the reason they did not take more time off was due to financial considerations and concern that they might be required to extend their residency making them ineligible for fellowships and employment positions. Half of the residents who had a child during residency in this survey reported burnout. The study also revealed that those women who had been afforded 8 or more weeks of leave were less likely to have suffered from postpartum depression or burnout. (Stack et al., 2018) Additionally, they were able to breast feed longer and reported feeling supported by their program and program directors. (Bae et al., 2016, Stack et al., 2018). Finally, among 104 married or partnered non-parents, 84 (81%) reported that they planned to delay childbearing due to their busy work schedules, concern for burdening colleagues and financial implications.

However, these changes will only be sustainable and widespread if our GME offices, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (AGCME) and American Board of Dermatology (ABD) weigh in and make changes that support new parents. One study found that concerns about being able to take the boards and extension of training were top of mind for dermatology residents and called for clarification of \u201cnew parent leave\u201d policies by the ABD. (Gracey et al., 2018) On-call and clinic schedules for women in their latter months of pregnancy need to be humane and not overburdened to compensate, or essentially punish them, because of their upcoming maternity leave. When the resident returns to work reduced work hours or adjustment in schedules to avoid the most taxing rotations as the first ones after maternity leave also should be addressed.

From my perspective as a mother and grandmother, I want to reaffirm that having a baby is not a vacation! It is an assault on a woman\u2019s body and psyche. Huge hormonal changes and physical and emotional changes are endured by a new mother. It is clearly inappropriate for a woman to have to use up all of her vacation time and face an entire year with no vacation or sick time in the bank. If we are going to level the playing fields for men and women in our profession, we are obliged to address the issue of pregnancy and maternity leave to enhance the health, happiness and success of our childbearing colleagues.",
