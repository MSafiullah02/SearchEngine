            "text": "A process comprising of size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and anion-exchange chromatography (AEC) was investigated for downstream processing of cell culture-derived influenza A virus. Human influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) was propagated in serum-free medium using MDCK cells as a host. Concentrates of the virus were prepared from clarified and inactivated cell culture supernatants by cross-flow ultrafiltration as described before. SEC on Sepharose 4 FF resulted in average product yields of 85% based on hemagglutination (HA) activity. Productivity was maximized to 0.15 column volumes (cv) of concentrate per hour yielding a reduction in total protein and host cell DNA (hcDNA) to 35 and 34%, respectively. AEC on Sepharose Q XL was used to separate hcDNA from virus at a salt concentration of 0.65 M sodium chloride. Product yields >80% were achieved for loads >160 kHAU/mL of resin. The reduction in hcDNA was 67-fold. Split peak elution and bimodal particle volume distributions suggested aggregation of virions. Co-elution with hcDNA and constant amounts of hcDNA per dose indiciated association of virions to hcDNA. An overall product yield of 52% was achieved. Total protein was reduced more than 19-fold; hcDNA more than 500-fold by the process. Estimation of the dose volume from HA activity predicted a protein content at the limit for human vaccines. Reduction of hcDNA was found insufficient (about 500 ng per dose) requiring further optimization of AEC or additional purification steps. All operations were selected to be scalable and independent of the virus strain rendering the process suitable for vaccine production. Biotechnol.

One common approach seems to be the digestion of hcDNA by nuclease-treatment Transfiguracion et al., 2003) . In other studies hcDNA was precipitated selectively from preparations of poliovirus using protamine sulphate or from adenovirus using cationic detergents (Amosenko et al., 1991; Goerke et al., 2005) . Kumar et al. (2002) reported the clearance of hcDNA from cell culture-derived rabies vaccine using a second density gradient centrifugation step. Knudsen et al.

A diafiltration step after AEC required for desalting and final concentration was assumed but not realized (Fig. 1) . Concentrates of human influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) were prepared by cross-flow ultrafiltration as described before (Kalbfuss et al., 2006) . Using these concentrates different SEC media (Sepharose CL-2B, Sepharose 4 FF, Sepharose 6 FF, and Superdex 200 p.g.) were tested for their ability to separate virus from protein and hcDNA. Separation was investigated in closer detail for Sepharose 4 FF as a function of column load. Four independent batches were processed under conditions derived from this loading study. The selectivity of two AEC media (Sepharose Q FF and Sepharose Q XL) between virus and hcDNA was compared. Sepharose Q XL was used to adsorb hcDNA from SEC-purified virus in negative mode (i.e., virus in flowthrough) after identification of the optimal salt concentration in batch adsorption experiments. Product yields on the basis of hemagglutination (HA) activity are reported for both chromatography steps. The removal of protein and hcDNA are reported wherever appropriate. Concentrates and product fractions of chromatography operations of two batches were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and agarose gel electrophoresis. Particle volume distributions were determined by dynamic light scattering analysis.",

First experiments with ionexchangers were conducted with HiTrap screening columns (all from GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Sweden).

The concentration of hemagglutinin protein therefore had to be estimated from HA activity. The content was calculated under the assumption of one virion bound per erythrocyte at the agglutination-endpoint (Donald and Isaacs, 1954) . According to the composition of virions reported by Knipe and Howley (2001) the total protein mass of influenza virions sums up to 2.66 \u00c2 10 8 g/mol. The fraction of hemagglutinin protein was determined to be 36.7% for egg-derived A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) by Oxford et al. (1981) . This is in good agreement with the theoretically derived 35% based on calculations with values from Knipe and Howley (data not shown). Since the concentration of erythrocytes used for the assay was adjusted to 2 \u00c2 10 7 mL \u00c01 , the virus particle concentration can be estimated according to N v \u00bc a HA /(HAU (0.1 mL) \u00c01 ) \u00c2 2 \u00c2 10 7 mL \u00c01 where a HA is the specific (i.e., per volume) HA activity.

In scouting experiments, columns 1-4 (packed with Sepharose CL-2B, Sepharose 4 FF, Sepharose 6 FF, and Superdex 200 p.g.) were loaded with 10% of their column volume (cv). Virus concentrate (produced by cross-flow ultrafiltration) from the same batch was used. UV absorbance at 280 nm was recorded online. Eluates were fractionated coarsely and analyzed offline for HA activity, total protein, and hcDNA ( Fig. 2) . The UV trace of all runs showed two distinct peaks corresponding to the K av of the void volume and small solutes (data not shown). Between the peaks the UV trace did not reach the baseline. According to offline-measured HA activity partial retention of the virus population occurred with Sepharose CL-2B (largest pore size). For all other media, the virus eluted exclusively in the void volume. Protein and hcDNA eluted between the two peaks detected by the UV monitor. A shift was observed from larger to smaller K av with decreasing pore size of the chromatography medium. In the case of Superdex 200 p.g. (smallest pore size) almost no separation between the virus and protein or hcDNA occurred. Viral and host cell protein were not distinguishable by the protein assay used. The correlation of HA activity and total protein in the first fractions of runs with Sepharose CL-2B and Sepharose 4 FF, however, suggested that the assay was mainly detecting viral protein in these fractions. According to this correlation, best separation of the virus from impurities was achieved with Sepharose CL-2B. Nevertheless, Sepharose 4 FF was chosen for preparative runs since elution of the virus occurred exclusively in the void volume. Elution in the void volume leads to narrower peaks (absence of mass transfer, no spread due to the size distribution of the virus population), and hence less dilution of the product. In addition, Sepharose 4 FF is more rigid than Sepharose CL-2B and therefore better to handle (easier column packing, higher flow rates).",

The parameter h is proportional to the product of pore diffusivity and accessible pore volume fraction.

In this study a high load of 0.15 cv was applied to a short column (30 cm) operated at a rather high flow rate (60 cm/h). The resulting productivity of 0.15 cv/h was sixfold higher than the productivity estimated for Heyward et al. (1977) and more than eightfold higher than the productivity estimated for Nayak et al.

On average 96% of eluted HA activity (corresponding to 85% of loaded HA activity) could be recovered in the product fraction which is in very good agreement with the 95% originally targeted. The loss of 10% of loaded HA activity can be explained by denaturation, aggregation, or non-specific adsorption of virions to the stationary phase. A similar product yield of 80% (based on HA activity and infectious activity) was reported by Heyward et al. (1977) for the purification of influenza virus on CPG (Table V) . In contrast, the yield obtained by Nayak et al. (2005) was much lower (38%) using Sepharose CL-2B which was a result of strong tailing of the virus peak. But also total recovery was lower with 70% compared to 89% in this study. Yields for vesicular stomatitis virus and moloney murine leukemia virus purified on Sepharose CL-4B were both lower with 70 and 53%, respectively. However, these yields were based on infectivity which may be less stable than HA activity. On average, total protein could be reduced to 35% of the amount loaded. Overall reduction was found to be 19-fold after SEC (Table VI) . A bias in this result, however, cannot be ruled out. Total recovery of protein was only 69% on average, which was ascribed to matrix interference. Components of the cell culture medium had been found to interfere with the protein assay before. For samples from supernatants or concentrates this was compensated by preparation of standard solutions in cell culture medium. Such compensation was not applicable to SEC eluate fractions, however, since their composition is undefined. Underestimation of the protein concentration was therefore likely upon co-elution with interfering substances leading to a total recovery of less than 100%. If interfering substances were assumed to be small, correct estimation of the total protein concentration would be expected for virus eluate fractions and underestimation for waste fractions. But this remains speculative. The situation for hcDNA was different. Here, a total recovery of 136% was found on average. A contribution from non-specific background fluorescence was ruled out by measurement of appropriate blanks (sample without dye). In contrast, repeated measurement of concentrates at various dilutions resulted in slightly higher hcDNA concentrations at higher dilution. It was thus concluded that interference by the cell culture medium was not compensated completely by the calibration procedure (same as for protein described above). As a consequence, underestimation of the hcDNA concentration in virus concentrates occurred and led to a total recovery of more than 100%. Hence, the estimation of hcDNA concentrations in virus eluate fractions would have been correct but the degree of hcDNA depletion underestimated.",

It was therefore concluded that degradation in this range was not unspecific (unfoalding, hydrolysis, etc.) but occurred due to a molecular mechanism responsible for endosomal membrane fusion upon infection. This mechanism was reported to involve an irreversible change in the conformation of hemagglutinin protein triggered by the low pH in endosomes (Knipe and Howley, 2001) . A similar finding for low pH was reported by Scholtissek (1985) . Infection of chicken embryo cells by infectious allantoic fluid was impaired if allantoic fluids were treated at low pH for 1 h before. The threshold pH investigated for 34 subtypes was reported to be in the range of 5-6. In contrast, high concentrations of NaCl did not show any effect on HA activity despite the dramatic change in osmotic pressure. This can possibly be explained by stabilization of the envelope by viral matrix protein.",

Since displacement is a competitive effect it is reasonable to assume that different displacers may yield different selectivity (depending on their affinity to the resin and their mobility). Under highly saturated conditions hcDNA may even displace the virus itself since the charge density (one negative charge per base pair) can be expected to be much higher than that of virions.

It could be shown that hcDNA in virus-containing lysates was only completely digestable by DNase after treatment with detergent and high salt buffer.
