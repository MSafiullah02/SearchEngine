[9], who studied 11 600 respiratory samples obtained between 2006 and 2009 in Edinburgh, United Kingdom, found at least 1 coronavirus in 2.3% of the samples, with marked predominance in winter months. Although they found a significant number of coinfections (mainly with RSV), single infections with HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 were specifically associated with lower respiratory tract disease. They also observed that HCoV-229E, which was identified in a smaller proportion of samples, was predominant among immunosuppressed patients. Talbot et al. [10] used molecular tools to determine the incidence and clinical features of upper and lower respiratory tract infections that are associated with HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E during a 20-year period and showed that HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 were associated with a significant burden of lower respiratory tract infections in previously healthy outpatient children who manifested with clinical syndromes, such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis, that were similar to those caused by other respiratory viruses [10].",

Another hypothesis is related to the mechanisms of disease of HCoV. Both SARS coronavirus and HCoV-NL63 use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the main pathway for attachment and entry. Following infection, a substantial reduction of the ACE2 expression in the cell surfaces occurs [14], but the rate and the intensity of this downregulation seems to be much lower in HCoV-NL63 infections as compared to SARS coronavirus infections. ACE2 downregulation was previously shown to be associated with an increase of the inflammatory process in the respiratory tract and may be one of the determinants of severity in acute respiratory distress syndrome [14]. Moreover, genetic polymorphisms associated with an increase of ACE expression (which counterbalance ACE2 action as a proinflammatory mediator) were shown to be associated with worse lung disease in CF patients [15].",

It should be mentioned that the mean age of our patients was approximately 9 years, while in the study by Talbot et al.
