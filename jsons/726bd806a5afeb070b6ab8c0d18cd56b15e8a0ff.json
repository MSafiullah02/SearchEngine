Correspondingly, small interfering RNA and short hairpin RNA mediated ATP1B3 silencing promoted HBsAg and HBeAg expression in the supernatants of HBV expression plasmids transfected HepG2 cells. Mechanically, we reported that ATP1B3 expression could activate nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathway by inducing the expression, phosphorylation, and nuclear import of P65 for the first time. And NF-\u03baB inhibitor (Bay11) impaired the restraint of ATP1B3 on HBV replication. This counteraction effect of Bay11 proved that ATP1B3-induced NF-\u03baB activation was crucial for HBV restriction. Accordingly, we observed that anti-HBV factors interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production were increased in HepG2 cells after the NF-\u03baB activation. It suggested that ATP1B3 suppressed HBsAg and HBeAg by NF-\u03baB/IFN-\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB/IL-6 axis. Further experiments proved that ATP1B3 overexpression induced anti-HBV factor BST-2 expression by NF-\u03baB/IFN-\u03b1 axis in HepG2 cells but not HEK293T cells, and ATP1B3 silencing downregulated BST-2 messenger RNA level in HepG2 cells. As an HBV restriction factor, BST-2 cooperated with ATP1B3 to antagonize HBsAg but not HBeAg in HepG2 cells. Our work identified ATP1B3 as a novel candidate of HBV restrictor with unrevealed mechanism and we highlighted it might serve as a potential therapeutic molecule for HBV infection. 1 Annually, 1.4 million deaths occur due to HBV-related diseases, including liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. 2 Currently, only nucleotide analogs and interferons (IFNs) are approved for the treatment of HBV infected patients. 3 HBV is a hepatotropic, enveloped virus of the Hepadnaviridae family with a partial double-stranded relaxed circular DNA genome. 4 HBV genome encodes four transcripts corresponding to capsid protein (hepatitis B core antigen [HBcAg]), envelope protein (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]), reverse transcriptase (Pol), and regulatory protein (HBx). Virus assembly begins with the formation of nucleocapsids by HBcAg, which are further enclosed by HBsAg. 5 HBV virions and subviral particles are the main viral particles produced during the replication of HBV. Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) is another form of HBcAg, which translocates into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen for proteolytic processing and is secreted as a soluble protein. 6 Although the function of HBeAg is still ambiguous. HBsAg and HBeAg are admitted important for HBV propagation and clinical diagnosis.",

ATP1B1 was identified as a partner of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL136 protein as well as M2 proteins of influenza A and B viruses. 9,10 ATP1B3 was found to reduce BST-2-mediated restriction of human immunodeficiency virus 1 production in Hela cells. 11 Inversely, ATP1B3 was shown to interact with the 3A protein of Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and inhibit EV71 replication by enhancing the production of type-I IFN. 12 BST-2 was identified as an IFN-inducible antiviral protein that blocked the release of various enveloped viruses, such as HIV, Lassa, Marburg, and Ebola at the plasma membrane. 13, 14 It was constitutively expressed in HepG2, HeLa, H9, Jurkat, primary T lymphocytes, and macrophages, but was absent from 293T, HOS, and HT1080 cells. In 2015, Yan et al 15 reported that BST-2 directly and selectively inhibited the secretion of HBV virions, but not subviral particles or nonenveloped capsids in hepatocyte-derived cells. And Miyakawa et al 16 revealed that HBs could interact with BST-2 via its fourth transmembrane domain thereby inhibiting its dimerization and antiviral activity. Recently, our team proved that BST-2 tethered the nascent HBV virions at the plasma membrane. But there seems to be no obvious relationship between BST-2 and HBV production, which occurs in intracellular vesicles. Recently, the interaction of ATP1B3 and BST-2 was identified by using the yeast two-hybrid screen. 11 Hence, we are interested in discovering whether ATP1B3 is involved in HBV propagation and whether there is any relationship between ATP1B3 and BST-2 on HBV propagation. In the present study, we first characterized ATP1B3 as a novel host restrictor for HBV replication by nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB)/IFN-\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB/interleukin-6 (IL- 6) pathway. And we proved ATP1B3-induced its binding protein BST-2 to antagonize HBsAg but not HBeAg in HepG2 cells. Our work provided novel evidence and mechanism of ATP1B3 on viral infection.",

The type-I to -III IFNs, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 act as the key effectors in the innate immune response against HBV infection. [26] [27] [28] [29] Hence, ATP1B3induced IFN (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IL-28A, and IL-29) and cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) expression were determined by RT-PCR and ELISA. As shown in Figure 4A , ATP1B3 strongly upregulated IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6 expression in HepG2 cells. Four antiviral ISGs, which might involve in different stages of HBV infection, ISG-15, ISG-56, OAS2, and BST-2 were investigated. It was shown that ATP1B3 could obviously induce OAS2 and BST-2, but not ISG-15 and ISG-56 expression ( Figure 4B ), and OAS2 might have no impact on HBV replication (data not shown). Since BST-2 was reported to be likely to inhibit HBV particle release, 17, 30 we speculated that ATP1B3-induced BST-2 expression could contribute to the suppression function on HBV antigen. Hence, IFN-\u03b1-induced BST-2 expression in hepatocyte (HepG2) and nonhepatocyte (HEK293T) was investigated ( Figure 4C ). As it is known, BST-2 is a type-II transmembrane protein with 180 amino acids (approximately 19 kDa). However, previous studies indicated that endogenously expressed BST-2 protein contained complex carbohydrate modifications and presented as a smear of multiple 20 to F I G U R E 4 ATP1B3 induces IFN-\u03b1, IL-6, and antiviral associated ISG BST-2 in HepG2 cells.

C, BST-2 expression was enhanced in IFN-\u03b1 treated HepG2 but not HEK293T cells. D, BST-2 expression was attenuated in siRNA-mediated ATP1B3 silencing HepG2 cells. **P < .01, ns P > .05.

And siRNA-mediated ATP1B3 knockdown attenuated messenger RNA level of BST-2 in HepG2 cells ( Figure 4D) , which supported the conclusion that as an IFN-inducible antiviral protein, endogenous BST-2 expression was downregulated due to the reduced IFNs production by ATP1B3 shutdown. Hence, we concluded that ATP1B3 could induce BST-2 via NF-\u03baB/IFNs axis to promote HBV inhibition in hepatocyte.",

TAK1 is a key regulator of the innate immunity and the proinflammatory signaling pathway. In response to IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, and toll-like receptor agonists, it mediates the activation of NF-\u03baB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 pathways. 33 In addition, TAK1 has been proved to represent an intrinsic host restriction factor for HBV replication in hepatocytes. 34 Similar to ATP1B3, TAK1 can activate NF-\u03baB and antagonize HBV. This suggests the NF-\u03baB pathway is important in HBV replication. Hence, in Figure 3C (c), HBsAg and HBeAg were significantly downregulated following TAK1 expression and NF-\u03baB activation in control cells. Although HBV replication recovered because of shRNA-mediated ATP1B3 silencing, TAK1 overexpression still showed an anti-HBV effect to some extent.",

Through IFN-\u03b1 stimulation, ATP1B3 cooperates with ISG BST-2, resulting in a synergistic effect to enhance inhibitory on HBsAg but not HBeAg. In summary, our work highlights ATP1B3 as a potential therapeutic molecule in HBV infection. The role of the \u03b2-subunit family of Na + /K + -ATPase in virus infection is also suggested to be worthy of further investigations.",
