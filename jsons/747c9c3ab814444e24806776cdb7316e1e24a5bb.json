An overview of the molecular biology of HAV is presented with an emphasis on recent findings. Immune evasion strategies and a possible correlation between HAV and atopy are discussed as well. Despite the availability of efficient vaccines, antiviral drugs targeting HAV are required to treat severe cases of fulminant hepatitis, contain outbreaks, and halt the potential spread of vaccine-escape variants. Additionally, such drugs could be used to shorten the period of illness and decrease associated economical costs. Several known inhibitors of HAV with various mechanisms of action will be discussed. Since none of these molecules is readily useable in the clinic and since the availability of an anti-HAV drug would be of clinical importance, increased efforts should be targeted toward discovery and development of such antivirals.

            "text": "Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a major cause of enterically transmitted hepatitis worldwide, posing a global burden estimated in 2005 at 119 million infections of which 31 million resulted in symptomatic illness and 34,000 in death. 1 The virus is transmitted faeco-orally, mainly through close contact with infected individuals or by consumption of contaminated food and drinking water. The extreme environmental stability of the HAV particle contributes significantly to its transmission. 2, 3 HAV epidemiology correlates with poor hygiene and living conditions. Consequently, virtually every adult in developing countries is seropositive due to childhood infection. On the contrary, in regions with improved hygiene standards, infection is often postponed to later age. In addition, disease severity is generally age-dependent: infections are usually mild or asymptomatic in young children, whereas at older age, hepatitis A frequently presents with classic symptoms of acute hepatitis (e.g., jaundice, fatigue, general malaise, etc.) and a higher incidence of fulminant hepatitis, which may require liver transplantation. 4 Fulminant hepatitis occurs especially in those aged over 50 for which mortality rates up to 5.4% have been reported. 5 Additionally, HAV superinfections in chronic liver disease patients (e.g., hepatitis B or C) are believed to increase morbidity and mortality, [6] [7] [8] although these findings are still subject to debate. 9 Since highly efficient vaccines that provide long-lasting immunity have become available, HAV mortality and morbidity has decreased dramatically. 8, 10 However, occasional outbreaks of hepatitis A, sometimes resulting in fatal outcomes, still occur in industrialized countries. For instance, in the last decade, outbreaks have been linked to the consumption of contaminated green onions, semidried tomatoes, seafood, such as raw oysters and sushi, and other foodstuffs. [11] [12] [13] [14] As posited earlier, 15 research interest in the molecular biology and pathogenesis of HAV has decreased substantially since the availability of a safe and efficient vaccine. Nonetheless, HAV remains an intriguing and poorly understood virus and hepatitis A is still a public health problem in many countries. Here, we will review key aspects of the biology of HAV with an emphasis on recent findings and the unique characteristics of the virus. The potential clinical use of antivirals against HAV will be discussed as well.",

Despite the fact that HAV is classified within the family of the Picornaviridae, it exhibits quite some differences compared to other members of this family and is consequently the sole member of the genus Hepatovirus. 16 Based on phylogenetic analysis of full length VP1 sequences, the single HAV serotype is divided into six genotypes (I-VI). 17 Genotypes I to III are human and can be subdivided into subgenotypes A and B (and potentially subgenotype IC 18 ), whereas genotypes IV to VI are of simian origin. 17 The HAV genome (as shown in Fig. 1 ) is approximately 7.5 kb in length and consists of a 5 untranslated region (UTR), a single open reading frame (ORF) and a 3 -UTR with a polyadenosine tract. Like other picornaviruses, the HAV genome lacks a cap structure; instead a VPg protein (3B) is attached to the 5 end. In the 5 -UTR, six secondary structure domains can be found: domain I contains a hairpin structure, while the second domain comprises two stem loop structures followed by a polypyrimidine tract (pY1). 19 The remaining domains form the type III internal ribosome entry site (IRES) allowing capindependent translation of the viral genome. The single ORF comprises the structural genes (VP1 to VP4 (= P1) and 2A) and the nonstructural genes (2B-2C and 3A-3D). The short 3 -UTR contains two stem loops and/or a pseudoknot structure which are, together with domains I and II and the polypyrimidine tract of the 5 -UTR, crucial for viral RNA synthesis. 20",

For instance, it has been suggested that TIM-3 promotes HAV entry without being a functional receptor. 25 In addition, HAVspecific IgA are reported to mediate infection of hepatocytes via the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR). 26 This and the fact that IgA was also identified as a natural ligand for HAVcr-1 27 may explain why (and how) IgA-coated HAV can enter the hepatocytes through both HAVcr-1 and ASGPR, thereby promoting enterohepatic circulation and continuous (endogenous) reinfections of the liver. 28 This phenomenon is thought to play an essential role in prolonged and relapsing cases of hepatitis A. Only the emergence of avid IgG antibodies can break the cycle and eventually clear the infection. 28",

This has been suggested to occur through receptor-mediated endocytosis since HAV infection can be inhibited by blockers of endosomal acidification such as monensin, ammonium chloride, and chloroquine. [29] [30] [31] [32] However, the precise mechanism remains unclear to date. Upon binding to its receptor the particle is destabilized, thus initiating the uncoating process and releasing the single-stranded RNA into the host cell cytoplasm. 33 Uncoating has been reported to be a slow and asynchronous process with a reported duration of 4-10 hr, in contrast to under an hour for poliovirus. 34 It has been proposed that this asynchronicity may be due to the fact that the HAV inoculum contains a heterogeneous mixture of mature virions and provirions. These provirions still require a maturation cleavage (of VP0 into VP2 and VP4, as discussed below) following entry, prior to uncoating, and might therefore uncoat more slowly than mature virions. 34, 35 During the uncoating process, dense, noninfectious HAV uncoating intermediates are formed. Intriguingly, these particles do not appear to have an altered sedimentation profile, thereby differing from the typical picornaviral A particle. 36 Finally, both low pH and Ca 2+ ions are reported to play an important role in HAV receptor binding, uncoating and during the maturation cleavage of provirions following virus entry (as described above). 31, 32, 35, 37 Upon completion of uncoating, the single-stranded RNA is released into the host cell by an unknown mechanism. r DEBING, NEYTS, AND THIBAUT",

Similar to other picornaviruses, HAV employs an IRES, located in the 5 UTR, to direct cap-independent translation of the viral genome using the host ribosomal machinery. Most picornaviruses affect the host cell protein synthesis to favor a more efficient translation of the viral mRNA. This process is mediated by a proteolytic cleavage of eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), thereby inducing a complete shutdown of capped mRNA translation. 38 Intriguingly, unlike for other picornaviruses, it is thought that HAV IRES depends on eIF4G, as part of an intact eIF4F complex. 39 The fact that HAV has to compete with an intact host cell machinery may also explain its poor replication in cell culture (see Section 5). However, a recent publication by Redondo et al. suggested that HAV IRES-driven translation can occur without intact eIF4G and that another factor may be crucial for this translation. 38 Next, the translated polyprotein is processed co-and posttranslationally in a series of proteolytic cleavages into several functional precursor and mature proteins. The primary posttranslational cleavage occurs at the junction between P1-2A and 2B (instead of the junction between P1 and 2A as for other picornaviruses) (Fig. 1 ). 40 All other processing steps (except the VP1-2A junction, as discussed below) are mediated by 3C pro and its functional precursor 3ABC pro . 41 This is different from other picornaviruses that may use L pro , 2A, 3C pro , and the 3CD pro precursor. 42 Intriguingly, HAV protein 2A, unlike for other picornaviruses, has no proteolytic activity nor does it contain a ribosome-skipping sequence, 42 but seems to be implicated in morphogenesis (see Section 2,F).",

The N-terminal cleavage product of PABP was shown to have an improved RNA-binding capacity compared to uncleaved PABP and may act as a dominant negative for IRES-mediated translation, thus favoring viral RNA synthesis. 44 Additionally, proteolytic cleavage of the poly(rC)-binding protein PCBP2, which interacts with the pyrimidine-rich tract pY1 in the HAV 5 -UTR, may also be implicated in regulating the balance between translation and viral RNA synthesis. 19 Other enzymes that bind to the HAV IRES are polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and La autoantigen, which respectively enhance, suppress, and suppress translation.

Studies revealed important roles for 2BC precursor and 2C proteins in the membrane rearrangements forming the replication complexes. These complexes are described as a tubular vesicular network and were thought to be of endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) origin. 48, 49 However, a recent publication described the mitochondrial localization of the 3ABC precursor protein suggesting that HAV replication complexes may be derived from the outer mitochondrial membrane. 50 In line with this hypothesis, exchanging the mitochondria-targeting 3A transmembrane domain for the ER-targeting poliovirus 3A transmembrane domain resulted in loss of replication competence. 51 Within the replication complexes, the viral genome is transcribed into antisense RNA, which subsequently serves as a template for the production of new viral genomes. During this process, the 3D protein functions as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The 3B (VPg) protein serves as a starting point for primer-independent transcription and is covalently linked to the 5 genome end. A conserved replication element near the 5 end of the 3D pol -coding sequence likely directs uridylylation of VPg by 3D pol , in such way priming VPg for initiation of RNA replication. 52 During replication, the 3A/3B junction remains uncleaved and the transmembrane protein 3A serves as an anchor tethering the growing HAV RNA strand and associated proteins to the membranes of the replication complex, 42, 53 as is the case for other picornaviruses. 54 It has also been reported that the 2C protein of HAV binds to the 3 end of the antisense RNA. In this way, protein 2C may be implicated in anchoring the negative sense RNA template to the membranes of the replication complex. 55",

Following the initial cleavage at the 2A/2B junction by 3C pro (as discussed above), the N-terminal part of protein 2A coordinates proper folding of the P1-2A precursor protein. This precursor protein is then processed by 3C pro and its stable precursor 3ABC pro into VP0 (consisting of VP4 and VP2), pX precursor (consisting of VP1 and 2A), and mature VP3 protein. 42, 56 These building blocks assemble into pentamers and subsequently associate with viral RNA to form preprovirions. In a final processing step, VP0 will be cleaved into VP4 and VP2 and precursor pX into VP1 and 2A, yielding mature virus particles with only VP1, VP2, and VP3 proteins. The processing of pX is mediated by a yet unknown cellular protease. 57 Although the cleavage can be performed by extracellular enzymes like factor Xa and trypsin, 58, 59 maturation can also be executed by the lysosomal proteinase cathepsin L. This may indicate a role for lysosomal proteinases in maturation cleavage and potential targeting of HAV provirions to the early lysosomes for maturation cleavage. 59 On the other hand, VP0 processing is thought to be a self-catalytic process that is dependent on the presence of encapsidated RNA. 60 The resulting VP4 is rather small compared to other picornaviruses and lacks an N-terminal myristoylation signal. 61 Note that the mature VP4 protein has never been identified in purified virus stocks and its role in capsid formation remains unclear. 15, 60 ",

Despite the fact that the exact details of HAV release remain elusive, the mechanism seems to differ depending on the cell type infected and is thought to involve either a vesicle-mediated cellular protein transport pathway or specialized hepatocellular transport proteins involved in bile secretion. 62 Blank and colleagues demonstrated that following infection of polarized human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells, release of progeny virus was largely restricted to the apical membrane. 62 In this way, virus is secreted mainly into the intestinal lumen resulting in an amplification of the HAV inoculum in the intestines and thus an increased viral shedding and spreading of the virus. However, it is still unclear by which mechanism HAV reaches the blood stream. A role for transcytosis by M cells present in Peyer's patches in the ileum has been suggested, a mechanism that was found for poliovirus and reovirus as well. 62 Another study described that infection of polarized human hepatocytes occurred most efficiently via the basolateral plasma membrane, after which more than 95% of progeny virus was exported through the basolateral membrane (into the bloodstream), rather than through the apical membrane (into the bile channels). 63 This contrasts with the in vivo observation that bile and faecal titers are considerably higher than serum titers. 15, 64 Reuptake and transcytosis of progeny virus by the hepatocytes into the bile channels is suggested as the mechanism for enteric secretion.",

Unlike for other picornaviruses, VP4 appears not to be present in mature HAV particles (see Section 2,F). Attempts to produce high-resolution images of HAV particles remained unsuccessful so far. A 2006 review 15 showed a medium-resolution image obtained by cryo-electron microscopy suggesting the absence of the well-defined canyon surrounding the fivefold axis, in this way differing from other picornaviruses. However, these results have not been confirmed or published separately to date. HAV has a limited number of neutralization antigenic sites. The immunodominant antigenic site is composed of VP1 and VP3 residues and is conformationdependent. 66 A second antigenic site is the glycophorin A binding site by which HAV can bind to erythrocytes, causing hemagglutination. This process is optimal at acidic pH, but is impaired at physiological pH. This suggests that HAV has evolved to escape erythrocyte binding and consequent clearance. 67, 68 Indeed, a mutant of this binding site displayed increased clearance from the blood and lower overall fitness, suggesting evolutionary constraints and explaining the low level of antigenic variability of the glycophorin A binding site. 68 ",

            "text": "One of these evasion tactics is to ablate the innate immunity's alarming system that induces IFN expression. HAV was shown to inhibit double-stranded RNA (ds RNA)-induced IFN\u03b2 gene expression 70 by interfering with the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) signaling pathways (Fig. 2) . 71 RIG-I recognizes single-stranded 5 -triphosphate RNA, while MDA-5 detects single-and double-stranded picornaviral RNA covalently linked to VPg. 72 Both RIG-I and MDA-5 use an adaptor protein called mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS, also known as IPS-1, VISA, or Cardif) that is localized on the outer membrane of the mitochondria. 50 Upon activation by RIG-I or MDA-5, MAVS recruits and activates TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor of NF-\u03baB kinase \u03b5 (IKK\u03b5). TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 are both responsible for the phosphorylation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), eventually leading to IRF-3 dimerization, nuclear translocation, and induction of IFN\u03b2 transcription. HAV proteins 3ABC pro50 and 2B 72 have been described to interfere with MAVS, thereby disrupting the innate cellular antiviral defense mechanism. Precursor protein 3ABC is a stable polyprotein processing intermediate that requires both the 3A and the 3C pro domain for the cleavage and inactivation of MAVS. The transmembrane domain of protein 3A ascertains mitochondrial localization while the 3C pro catalytic site performs the actual proteolytic cleavage of MAVS. Mere 3C pro , lacking the 3A domain, is incapable to perform this proteolysis. 50 In addition, it has been demonstrated that protein 2B suppressed both MAVS functioning and the kinase activities of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, thus synergistically suppressing RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling, although the exact mechanism still remains to be elucidated. 72 Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) provides an additional recognition mechanism for dsRNA. Activation also results in IRF-3 phosphorylation and induction of IFN\u03b2 transcription, but unlike RIG-I and MDA-5, the downstream action of TLR3 is mediated through TRIF (Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN\u03b2), which activates the TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 kinases. A recent study reported the proteolytic cleavage of TRIF by the 3CD precursor. 73 In analogy with the specificity of 3ABC pro -induced cleavage of MAVS, 3C pro without the 3D domain is not capable of performing this cleavage. This suggests that the 3D pol sequence is required to modify the substrate specificity without requiring the catalytic polymerase activity. In addition, proteolytic cleavage of TRIF cannot be performed by the 3ABC intermediate. 73 Cleavage of TRIF and MAVS has been reported for other picornaviruses as well, for example, coxsackievirus B3 (MAVS and TRIF) 74 and enterovirus 71 (TRIF). 75 Unlike for HAV, 3C pro of both viruses appeared to be sufficient for proteolysis. Interestingly, both MAVS and TRIF are also cleaved by the HCV NS3/4A protease. Despite the fact that the HAV and HCV proteases differ in cleavage specificity and are phylogenetically unrelated, they target the same pair of adaptor proteins, which may be considered a remarkable example of convergent evolution. 73",

            "text": "A second immune evasion strategy employed by HAV can be found in its codon bias or nonuniform usage of codons during translation. 76 Due to the lack of mechanisms to induce cellular shut off, HAV has to compete with host mRNA for translation (as described above). Within this context, HAV has strategically adopted a codon bias toward rare codons, resulting in a highly deoptimized coding usage. 77, 78 This phenomenon contributes considerably to the low replication efficiency of HAV in several ways and seems to serve multiple purposes: first, the deoptimized codon use may reflect a strategy by which rare tRNAs are preferred over abundant tRNAs thereby avoiding competition with cellular tRNAs in the absence of an adequate host cell translation shut off. 77 Second, due to a decreased translation and replication rate, the virus is capable of keeping the cellular amount of dsRNA to a minimum, thus escaping the host cell antiviral response. 78 In addition, CpG-containing codons are particularly suppressed in the HAV coding sequence. 79, 80 This particular codon deoptimization is proposed to be associated with the recognition of unmethylated CpG by the innate immunity as a pathogen marker, contrary to the methylated CpG pairs of the host. Also in this way, HAV can evade the attention of the immune system. Third, the use of rare codons, usually grouped in clusters, is important for translation kinetics as such cluster may lead to a transient translation stop, a phenomenon known as ribosome stalling. 81 It has been suggested that this transient stop may be an important prerequisite for proper folding of HAV structural proteins thereby contributing to the low antigenic variability and extreme environmental stability of HAV. 77, 78, 82 Consequently, when HAV is adapted to replicate in vitro under circumstances of chemically induced cellular shut off, the resulting strains (with a \"re-deoptimized\" coding sequence) display reduced environmental stability. 83 Given the preference of HAV for reduced RNA replication and translation levels, it is now comprehensible why HAV would employ such inefficient type III IRES 84, 85 : a very efficient IRES would not be compatible with escaping innate immunity and with the many ribosome stalls during translation. 83 In conclusion, the coding biases found in the HAV genome may result from evolutionary pressures toward (i) environmental stability (and thus controlled translation kinetics to obtain a resilient viral particle) and (ii) evading the host immune system. 79 Additional insights into the mechanisms at action would prove very valuable with regards to our understanding of virus evolution and virus-host interplay.",

HAVcr-1 is a phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) receptor and functions as a potent T-cell costimulatory molecule that regulates activation of and tolerance induction (thus suppressing autoimmune responses) in T cells. 24 A recent study reported that HAVcr-1 is constitutively expressed on regulatory T (Treg) cells. 86 The function of these specialized T cells is to limit the magnitude of the immune response to diverse pathogens in such way avoiding a hyperactive immune response and subsequent collateral (tissue) damage. 87 Several microorganisms activate Treg in order to limit inflammation and tissue injury, as is the case for chronic HBV and HCV infections. 87 Conversely, binding of HAV to its receptor inhibits Treg cell functioning. 86 In this way, the host is overwhelmed by anti-self-responses since Treg cells normally suppress autoimmune reactions, allowing HAV to escape the attention of the immune system. In addition, HAV inhibits the production of transforming growth factor \u03b2 by Treg cells, thereby blocking T-effector-mediated anti-HAV responses. Complementary, HAV stimulates IL-22 production that limits immune-mediated liver damage. 86 Taken together, by inhibiting Treg function, HAV creates an environment that favors viral replication and establishment of infection. These findings may also provide an explanation why HAV may elicit autoimmune hepatitis and extrahepatic manifestations including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, even though these complications are rare. 88 ",

HAV can be adapted to growth in cell culture through serial passaging; a process that introduces cell culture adapting mutations stepwise into the viral genome. Such mutations have been found in the P2 region (especially in 2B and 2C) 98, 99 and in the 5 -UTR, 100, 101 but also in other parts of the genome. 98 Intriguingly, these cell culture adapting mutations result in HAV strains that are highly attenuated in vivo (e.g., references 102, 103). A major advance in culturing HAV was the selection of a Huh7 cell line (designated Huh7-A-I) that allows genetically stable growth of wt HAV without the accumulation of cell culture adapting mutations. 104 Although wt HAV does not induce a cytopathic effect (CPE) in cell culture, cytopathic strains may arise during prolonged serial passaging. 105 , 106 CPE appears to be cell type specific and is mostly found in monkey kidney cell lines like FRhK-4 and BS-C-1. These selected virus strains induce apoptosis through ribosomal RNA degradation by RNase L 107, 108 and consequent caspase activation. 109 Interestingly, it seems possible to induce CPE with cell culture adapted noncytopathic strains under specific conditions of lower temperature (<34 \u2022 C) and decreased cell density, both in FRhK-4 and human A549 cells. 110 Similarly, we observed CPE for the PA21 strain (genotype IIIa) in FRhK-4 cells under these conditions (unpublished results).",

Several of such protease inhibitors have been developed over the years, both modified peptides and nonpeptidic analogs. Despite the fact that the modified peptides are easier to design (by merely mimicking the natural protease substrate), nonpeptidic and peptidomimetic inactivators are preferred, since they can be modified in order to increase stability and cellular and gastrointestinal uptake, properties that are difficult to attain for peptides. A similar approach has already been applied to rhino-and enterovirus 3C pro and resulted in the molecule rupintrivir that was halted after unsuccessful phase II clinical trials. 140 The first HAV 3C pro inhibitors developed were modified peptides based on the acetyl-Leu-Ala-Ala sequence, serving as competitors for the natural peptide substrate Leu-Arg-Thr. 141 Based on these findings, peptidyl aldehyde and monofluoromethylketone (FMK) inhibitors were developed. 142, 143 Resolving the crystal structure of HAV 3C pro in complex with a peptidyl FMK inhibitor indicated that the inhibitor covalently binds the catalytic cysteine. 144 One of these peptidyl FMK inhibitors was also tested ex vivo and was shown to reduce HAV replication by 96%. 143 However, cellular uptake appeared to be a major problem. In addition, several azaglutamine derivatives were found to be irreversible peptidic inhibitors. 145 On the other hand, several nonpeptidic antagonists were reported as well. Asymetric azodicarboxamides were found to be irreversible inhibitors of HAV and HRV 3C pro . 146 Serine and threonine \u03b2-lactones also inhibited HAV 3C pro . 147, 148 Other inhibitors include monophenyl pseudoxazolones of glycine (IC 50 of 4-6 \u03bcM) 149 and cathepsin K inhibitor-based ketoglutamines. 150 Lastly, halopyridinyl esters were reported as the most potent nonpeptide HAV 3C pro inhibitors thus far with IC 50 's as low as 53 nM. 151 Although recent publications in this field seem to focus increasingly on HRV 3C pro and coronavirus 3CL pro , 152 it would be wise not to neglect possible anti-HAV activity for potential future (off-label) use of a marketed HRV or coronavirus protease inhibitor for severe HAV infections.",

RT-qPCR-based virus yield assays for HM175/18f and genotype IIIA strain PA21 were developed as well, allowing for confirmation and further characterization of the antiviral activity of selected molecules. The known inhibitors IFN\u03b1 and amantadine were used to validate these assays. Using these assays, three enterovirus inhibitors with different targets were evaluated for anti-HAV activity. Pleconaril, a known capsid binder, 140 yielded (not unexpectedly) a very limited activity; inhibition by rupintrivir, a 3C pro inhibitor, proved to be strain-dependent 156 ; and enviroxime, a direct inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase III\u03b2 (PI4KIII\u03b2) that induces resistance mutations in enterovirus protein 3A, 157 was inactive in all three systems. Recently, PI4KIII\u03b2 has been identified as an essential host factor in the replication strategy of enteroviruses. Following recruitment by enterovirus protein 3A to ER-derived organelle membranes, a phosphatidylinositol-4phosphate-rich environment is created, promoting viral RNA replication. The observation that r DEBING, NEYTS, AND THIBAUT HAV protein 3A is targeted toward the outer mitochondrial membrane instead of the ER, 50 together with the observed lack of activity for enviroxime in two different cell lines, 156 suggests that PI4KIII\u03b2 kinase activity does not play a role in HAV replication.",

Outbreaks and occasional cases of fatal fulminant hepatitis A still occur and as the age of infection shifts upwards, the severity of the infection increases as well. Morbidity and mortality may also increase in patients with chronic liver disease, for example, due to HBV or HCV. Additionally, a recent report warned for the potential emergence of vaccine-escape variants. 18 Taken together, these reasons warrant continuation and expansion of the current vaccination programs, but also the development of antiviral drugs against HAV, even though this may not be particularly interesting from a commercial point of view. So far no potent or selective inhibitors have been reported. We therefore propose to focus antiviral efforts on marketed drugs and antivirals that are currently in clinical development. Off-label use of such drug would be a much appreciated therapy. In fact, we are currently employing our CPE reduction assay for screening of a library of FDAapproved/marketed drugs and with promising results so far. Also on the fundamental biology level, HAV remains a largely understudied virus, despite many interesting features. Further investigation could provide unique insights into pathogenesis, tissue tropism determinants, and replication strategies for HAV and picornaviruses in general. ",

His research project addresses the development of novel antiviral strategies against hepatitis A virus and hepatitis E virus. Johan Neyts was born in 1966 and is full professor of Virology at the University of Leuven, Belgium. His research is focused on the development of novel antiviral strategies against a number of viruses including picornaviruses (such as rhinoviruses that cause exacerbations of asthma and COPD), flaviviruses (mainly dengue), and the hepatitis C virus. His work has been published in several book chapters, in more than 280 peer-reviewed papers and in several patents. Three molecules discovered in his lab as HCV inhibitors made it to advanced clinical studies in man for the treatment of chronic HCV infections. He is on the editorial board of a number of journals, member of several national and international scientific committees and advisory boards as well as on the board of the \"International Society for Antiviral Research.\" He is co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of Okapi Sciences NV, a company developing antivirals for veterinary use. He teaches medical virology at the school of dentistry and the school of medicine at the University of Leuven. He has been honored with a number of awards including from the International Society for Antiviral Research, the Royal Belgian Academy of Medicine, and the Belgian Fund for Scientific Research. Hendrik Jan Thibaut was born in 1984 and obtained his Ph.D. degree in virology in 2012 at the University of Leuven. He is currently involved in several projects on picornaviruses in the research group of Prof. J. Neyts at the Rega Institute, University of Leuven. His research focuses on the identification and characterization of novel antiviral strategies for the treatment of infections with enteroviruses, with a special interest in protein 2C and the role of the host cell in virus morphogenesis.",
