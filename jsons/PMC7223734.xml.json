Incorrect insertion procedure can harm patient. Anesthesiologists regularly perform catheterization during medical care; thus, they need to fully understand its safety and risks and be able to do it properly. This guide describes the current state of central venous catheterization and proposes the directions for the procedure. Note that the items in this guideline are described for general principles. Decisions for the procedure on specific cases must be made by the physicians in charge.",

In the latter cases, the catheter is usually removed after a short period. The risk of infection differs between these two categories [1]. When catheterization is performed for long-lasting therapeutic purposes, the patient\u2019s psychological condition and other factors must be considered, unlike catheterization with surgical anesthesia. In either, the procedure should be explained to the patient and his/her family, and informed consent should be obtained beforehand [2, 3]. When central venous catheterization needs to be performed in an emergency case, it is preferable to explain the procedure beforehand even just to the family. If the procedure is part of an extreme lifesaving treatment, it should be explained as soon as possible after the procedure to inform the patient. If fluoroscopy or other examinations are needed after catheterization, this should also be explained as well.",

Institutions and hospitals should introduce the use of mannequins and other educational equipment for puncture simulations. If it is difficult for an institution to obtain such equipment on its own, holding joint training sessions at academic conferences or other venues is recommended. These sessions can also provide opportunities to learn methods for discovering complications quickly. Simulation training should also cover infection control [7].",

At this location, the IJV runs roughly parallel to the trachea. The central approach, in which a puncture is made from the apex of this triangle toward the ipsilateral nipple, avoids erroneous puncture of the common carotid artery. The operator should remember needle direction not being coincide with the pathway of the IJV. It means that once the needle cannot catch the IJV, never catch the IJV with deeper sticking. When using the central approach and the usual depth of the vein is exceeded, the subclavian artery or the lung can be possibly punctured. Various small arteries lie posterior to the IJV, including the thyrocervical trunk branching from the subclavian artery, the inferior thyroid artery, the transverse cervical artery, and the suprascapular artery as well as the vertebral artery and other vessels, which are all at risk of puncture during this procedure. To avoid mistakenly puncturing one of these arteries, practitioners must avoid puncturing deeply or medially (Fig. 2) [12].",

The classic landmark method is direct insertion of the needle sticking from the infraclavicular fossa (an area on the lateral clavicle, where the muscle becomes thin between the lateral margin of the pectoralis major and the medial margin of the deltoid) into the gap between the medial clavicle and medial first rib. Another method aims directly at the medial third of the dorsal side of the clavicle. Whichever is used, puncturing the nearby subclavian artery or the lung, causing pneumothorax, is possible.

A pre-scan is a useful method of risk assessment and should be performed if possible even when landmark techniques are used. When a pre-scan is performed before employing the landmark technique, the position of the target vein is confirmed with ultrasound; thus, this would fall under the ultrasound-guided category (static approach, described below) [16, 19].

The latest report indicates that catheter-related bloodstream infections occur least frequently with the SV and that there is not much difference between the IJV and the FV [23]. However, many medical institutions are not thorough about infection control; thus, this guide recommends switching from FV catheterization to another central venous route. Furthermore, FV catheterization is not a recommended a site due to the high risk of thrombus formation associated with it.",

In this position, the IJV is dilated, which makes puncturing easier (the SV is also slightly dilated [33], and air embolism does not occur easily (see \"Air embolism\")). Adding the Valsalva maneuver increases venous pressure, which is thought to help prevent the needle from penetrating the posterior wall [34]. Setting the ventilator to apply positive end-expiratory pressure at about 5\u201310 cm water-column pressure will also help increase venous pressure [35, 36].

            "text": "Confirm the location of the IJV in the Sedillot\u2019s triangle during the pre-scan (if necessary, draw a map using a skin pen\u2014this is why the static approach is also called the map-making method) (Fig. 4).In the pre-scan, measure the rough distance to the IJV if puncturing at a 30\u00b0\u201345\u00b0 angle to the skin, and use this as a guide so as to not puncture deeply.Before the main puncture, perform a pilot puncture using a small needle (22\u201323 G). This is done to ensure that a puncture at the direction and depth confirmed by ultrasound reaches the IJV.Confirm whether the needle has entered the vein by applying slight negative pressure to the syringe to see whether any blood is aspirated into the syringe (backflow of blood).If backflow of blood is observed, remember the puncture direction and length for the main puncture [the red dashed arrow shows the puncture direction (Fig. 4a)].The main puncture uses a larger needle than the pilot puncture, which makes is more difficult to penetrate the anterior wall of the vein and tends to lead to a slightly deeper puncture (Fig. 4b). Puncturing deeper than necessary increases the possibility of complications; thus, sufficient care should be taken. (Be careful not to carelessly puncture deeper than the anticipated puncture length. The absence of backflow of blood even after puncturing to the anticipated depth indicates a strong possibility that both the anterior and posterior walls have been penetrated. If so, slowly withdraw the needle while applying negative pressure. If the posterior wall was penetrated, backflow of blood will arrive once the needle returns to the lumen of the vein.)Examine the force and color of the backflow of blood to check for mistaken arterial puncture. However, if the bevel of the needle is touching the posterior wall of the vein or if a patient has poor circulation (e.g., patient is in state of shock), a decision cannot be made based on the force of the backflow of blood alone [29, 39]. Furthermore, in patients with anemia or those using artificial respiration, the aspirated blood cannot be confirmed to be venous blood based on the color [29, 39].If mistaken arterial puncture is not accurately assessed and a dilator is inserted when an artery has been punctured, it will increase the damage to the artery and lead to secondary complications. Therefore, when using the static approach, use a needle with a cannula (modified Seldinger technique), and once backflow of blood has been confirmed, temporarily insert a guidewire and place the cannula along it. Then, check whether the backflow of blood from the cannula is arterial. If in doubt, take a blood sample for blood gas analysis, attach a small extension tube to measure venous pressure, or attach a pressure monitor to check for an arterial pressure waveform [29] (see \u201cConfirmation procedure to avoid mechanical complications\u201d).Once it is confirmed that an artery has not been mistakenly punctured, insert the guidewire. When doing this, confirm that there is no resistance to the insertion. Do not insert the guidewire deeper than 20 cm. Inserting the guidewire deeply has the risk of stimulating the heart, which can cause arrhythmia [39, 40]. If arrhythmia occurs, immediately withdraw the guidewire and wait until normal sinus rhythm is restored (sometimes defibrillation may be necessary [41]).When inserting the dilator, hold the posterior end of the guidewire firmly and insert the dilator along the natural angle of the guidewire to prevent the guidewire from bending or being left behind in the body. The dilator should be inserted no more than 5 cm; hence, be careful not to insert it deeper than necessary. (For patients with thick necks, use ultrasound to measure the necessary insertion length, then insert the dilator carefully.) Inserting a dilator deeply could damage the vein [42, 43].When inserting the catheter, hold the guidewire firmly to prevent being left in the body. The catheter is placed at a depth of about 13 cm in a standard adult (12-15 cm, estimated based on height) [44]. There are methods for making accurate estimates based on anatomical landmarks on the body surface and information from chest radiographs [45]. In one simple method, the distance is estimated by adding the length between the needle insertion point (normally, the apex of the Sedillot\u2019s triangle on the right neck) and the right clavicular notch (sternoclavicular joint) and where the joint of the manubrium sterni touches the second rib [46].The catheter should be fixed in place correctly according to the instruction manual of the product used.",

In such situations, ultrasound can be used to confirm the position of the guidewire and follow it centrally as much as possible.

Basically, ultrasound images are not used during puncture in the static approach; thus, it is important to check that the puncture needle is definitely in the vein. Inserting a cannula into the vessel allows manipulations to be performed stably. It is possible to mistake arteries for veins with signs such as the color and force of backflow blood with hypoxemia, extremely high oxygen partial pressure, or hypotension, such as in states of shock. It is easy to measure pressure by attaching a small extension tube, by displaying the pressure waveform to confirm the presence of a venous pressure waveform, or by taking a blood sample for blood gas analysis to confirm venous blood. One of these methods is necessary to confirm that the needle is inside a vein. As described in the section on puncture techniques, as it can be difficult to confirm that the punctured vessel is a vein with the metal needles that are used in the static approach, the use of a cannula needle is recommended. Therefore, if a metal needle is selected with the static approach, ultrasound images or other examinations should be used to confirm that the inserted guidewire does not penetrate the posterior wall and is traveling inside the vein. Even if a cannula needle is used, it is preferable to confirm through ultrasound images or other examinations that the inserted guidewire does not penetrate the posterior wall and is traveling inside the vein.",

After confirming in the ultrasound images that the guidewire did not penetrate both the anterior and posterior walls of the vein and is traveling inside the vein, the dilator can be inserted. If a cannula needle is used, once the color and force of the backflow blood indicate it is venous blood, the guidewire can be inserted.

If it is difficult to make a decision based on the backflow blood, insert the guidewire about 10 cm and insert the cannula up to its base, then, as in the static approach, confirm the presence of venous blood by attaching an extension tube to display a pressure waveform or for blood gas analysis. Then, insert the guidewire. After this, confirm in the ultrasound images that the guidewire does not penetrate both the anterior and posterior walls of the vein and is traveling inside the vein, then insert the dilator.

The following describes the methods for confirming in ultrasound images that the guidewire is traveling inside the vein. After inserting the guidewire, the short axis will look like the image in Fig. 15a. However, it cannot be declared that the guidewire is traveling inside the vein from this alone. This is because the possibility that the guidewire has penetrated the vein cannot be ruled out. Thus, short-axis images must be observed by moving the ultrasound probe slowly from the guidewire puncture site toward the heart to around the clavicle. This will show that, in most cases, if the guidewire penetrates the skin and enters the vein, it proceeds almost as if it is in contact with the vessel wall. Next, if possible, the tip of the guidewire should be depicted in a long-axis image. As shown in Fig. 15b, if it can be confirmed that the guidewire tip is traveling along the vein parallel to it and without any changes in angle, it is acceptable to believe that it has not penetrated the vein. This confirmation procedure is extremely important for preventing mechanical complications.",

If a catheter of 7 Fr (equivalent to a diameter of 2.3 mm) or less is inserted into an area, where compression is possible and the catheter can be withdrawn and external compression applied for 10 min, then it can be withdrawn with no problem.

            "text": "\nIntravenous antibiotic prophylaxis should not be done routinely. However, this may be administered on a case-by-case basis for immunocompromised patients or high-risk neonates [65, 66].Maximal sterile barrier precautions (MBP): this includes hand washing, wearing of mask, cap, sterile gloves, and a sterile gown, and covering of the patient with large sterile drapes. Although the results of randomized trials on MBP have been unclear [67], observational studies have indicated that they reduce catheter-related bloodstream infections [62, 63, 68, 69].Skin disinfectants: use 1% chlorhexidine\u2013alcohol or 10% povidone\u2013iodine [70]. Side effects such as contact dermatitis, sensitivity reactions, and anaphylaxis have been reported with chlorhexidine; thus, alcohol solutions or aqueous solutions are currently used. Results regarding the skin toxicity of chlorhexidine in neonates of less than 44 week gestation are unclear; thus, each institution must make its own clinical decisions [29].Antimicrobial-impregnated central venous catheters: antimicrobial-impregnated central venous catheters should be used appropriately in consideration of the latent risk of the expression of resistant bacteria and the expensive cost. They should not be used in patients allergic to antibiotics, because there are reports of anaphylactic shock due to antimicrobial-impregnated central venous catheters [71, 72]. The use of chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine\u2014or rifampicin miconazole\u2014impregnated central venous catheters reduces the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections [73]. In Japan, only minocycline\u2013rifampicin-impregnated central venous catheters are available. This type of catheter can prevent catheter-related bloodstream infections in the intensive care unit better than chlorhexidine/silver-sulfadiazine-impregnated central venous catheters [74].Closed infusion system: the use of a closed infusion system can reduce the mortality rate of sepsis caused by catheter-related bloodstream infections [75]. In contrast, the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections rises with open three-way stopcocks [76]. If an open three-way stopcock is used, wipe the ports thoroughly with cotton soaked in a disinfectant (chlorhexidine, povidone\u2013iodine, 70% alcohol) for at least 15 s [77, 78]Puncture site selection: the puncture site should be determined based on clinical necessity. Contaminated areas (infected skin, burns) and areas that may be contaminated (groin, near the tracheostomy, surgical wounds) should be avoided. There is no significant difference in catheter colonization rates and catheter-related bloodstream infection incidence between the IJV and the SV [79\u201381]. The catheter colonization rate of the FV was higher than that of the SV catheterization, although the catheter-related infection rate was not different between the two veins [82].Covering the puncture site: bio-occlusive dressings are preferred for covering puncture sites to prevent infections. Chlorhexidine-impregnated sponges in catheter dressings can prevent catheter-related infections, and changing the frequency of changing dressings from every 3 days to every 7 days is recommended [83].Duration of catheterization: the duration of central venous catheterization should be based on clinical necessity. Longer periods of catheterization increase the risk of infection, but there is no standard for duration. The need for keeping the catheter should be evaluated daily, and catheters that are no longer needed should be removed immediately. Leaving in place a catheter that is no longer needed may cause catheter-related bloodstream infections. Even regularly replacing a central venous catheter does not reduce the frequency of catheter-related bloodstream infections [84]. The infection rate does not differ between using a guidewire to replace a central venous catheter and replacing it by making a new puncture. Replacing catheters using a guidewire every 3 days and every 7 days were compared, but no significant difference was observed in the formation of colonies on the catheter tip [85, 86]. The catheter puncture site should be checked daily for signs of infection, and if any are found, the catheter should be removed and the catheterization site changed. If a catheter-related infection is suspected, it is better to change the puncture site than replace the catheter with a guidewire [29].Drug administration and blood aspiration from a central venous catheter: when administering medication or aspirating blood from a central venous catheter, three-way stopcock ports should be wiped thoroughly with an appropriate disinfectant before use [29]. After use, three-way stopcocks should be capped. Access ports may also be used. Using needleless connectors can reduce the incidence of port infections [87].\n",

Pulling the needle back will create a space between the anterior and posterior walls and cause the vessel lumen to expand and fill with blood; thus, if the vessel has been penetrated, backflow of blood may appear in the process of withdrawing it.It can be difficult to differentiate arterial and venous blood by color in patients with cyanotic heart disease. Confirm venous residence of the wire using ultrasound imaging, or if this cannot be determined via ultrasound, measure the pressure by inserting a plastic cannula from a venous indwelling needle via the guidewire. Confirmation can also be performed by attaching a pressure transducer directly to the needle [91]. Do not insert a dilator unless it is certain that the guidewire resides in the vein.Test punctures are not recommended in small children. A hematoma caused by a test puncture will make the procedure even more difficult and could easily cause blockage.Even if the needle tip is definitely inside the vein, it is difficult to insert a guidewire into a vein with a small diameter; thus, consider using a guidewire with a hydrophilic monofilament. However, be careful of breakage when using metal needles.\n",
