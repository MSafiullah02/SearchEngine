The panel established a list of potential bioterrorism agents, including toxins, viruses, bacteria, and protozoa, that were classified into three categories (A, B, and C). The classification system was based on the following four criteria: (i) the potential to cause morbidity and mortality in healthy individuals; (ii) the potential to be disseminated within the public sphere; (iii) the perceived threat and potential to elicit fear or panic; (iv) the capacity of local, state, and federal public health networks to respond and control an event. In response to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) expanded this original list to include emerging infectious diseases, as well as threats to livestock and economically important crops. The members of this expanded list are collectively referred to as Select Agents and Toxins, the possession and use of which is now regulated by the National Select Agent Registry under the auspices of the CDC. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), specifically the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), considers a subset of the select agents as ''Priority Pathogens'' for which there is a particular need for countermeasures, including vaccines. A complete list of these agents with their respective designations (Category A-C) is presented in Table 1 .

These are Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, smallpox (variola major) and Francisella tularensis. Among these, smallpox poses the greatest threat to public safety due to its highly pathogenic nature, its capacity to spread person-to-person, and the fact that herd immunity to the virus has waned since routine vaccination was discontinued more than three decades ago (Artenstein 2008) . Anthrax also poses a significant and real threat to public health because B. anthracis spores are highly infectious, though the disease itself is not communicable. Also among the list of Category A agents is botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), one of the most lethal known biological toxins. While BoNT can be aerosolized and is highly toxic following inhalation, the CDC's primary concern is the possible use of the toxin to contaminate food/water supplies (Sobel et al. 2002) . The toxin is extremely potent via the oral route (~LD 50 of 0.001 lg/kg) and has a long history as a bioweapon. Botulinum neurotoxin has been produced in large scale quantities by numerous governments as well as terrorist organizations (Sobel et al. 2002) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 458, "end": 475, "text": "(Artenstein 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 929, "end": 948, "text": "(Sobel et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1206, "text": "(Sobel et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Category A Agents"}, {"text": "The Category B agents are defined as being moderately easy to disseminate, capable of inflicting moderate morbidity/low mortality and requiring specific enhancements to standard diagnostic capacity, as well as enhanced disease surveillance.

Aerosol dissemination of pathogenic organisms, from either a point source such as a contaminated letter sent through the postal service, or from a planned aerial attack remain the greatest type of biological threat to the general public. No other modality of dispersion, except perhaps the widespread contamination of drinking water, could do more harm than aerosol dissemination of an infectious or toxic agent (Henderson 1999) . Indeed, when engineered with the intent of causing mass casualties, biological agents pose health risks similar in magnitude to chemical or nuclear threats. Past weapons programs in the US and in the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) developed industrial processes for producing biological preparations that were optimized for aerosol delivery using sophisticated drying, milling, and packaging processes (Kortepeter et al. 2001 ). These preparations were designed for dispersion as highly respirable particles containing extremely large concentrations of stable, viable biological agent. Although many of the known biological weapons programs have been discontinued, aerosol delivery of an infectious or highly toxic biological agent continues to be a potential threat that rivals other weapons of mass destruction in terms of potential morbidity and mortality, as well as widespread panic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 555, "end": 571, "text": "(Henderson 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 995, "end": 1018, "text": "(Kortepeter et al. 2001", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Assessing the Risk Posed by Biothreat Agents"}, {"text": "The actual efficiency of aerosol to disseminate biological agents depends on the sophistication of the sample preparation, as well as biological and physical stressors in the environment. The infectivity of many of these pathogens is highly dependent on their size, hydrophobicity, and aggregation, as well as environmental conditions such as humidity and temperature. Humidity and temperature can affect particle size, which in turn determines the degree to which particles can penetrate the lungs. Highly respirable aerosols produced with a homogenous size distribution, commonly associated with sophisticated biological weapons, target the lower airways and alveolar spaces of the lung. Naturally-produced infectious aerosols, on the other hand, tend to be heterogeneous with respect to size, and will deposit throughout the respiratory tract. These physical differences not only dictate the degree of mucosal exposure associated with an aerosol, but may also impact the nature of the ensuing disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Assessing the Risk Posed by Biothreat Agents"}, {"text": "The network of food production, processing, and distribution in the US is vast and potentially vulnerable to deliberate contamination with toxins or infectious agents (Sobel and Watson 2009) . The vulnerability of the food supply at the national level is evidenced by the fact that food-borne outbreaks caused by a single source of Salmonella or shiga toxin-producing E. coli O157:H7 (STEC) are not uncommon. For example, just the past two years, two Salmonella outbreaks have accounted for more than 2,000 illnesses (and nine deaths) in 44 states and certain provinces in Canada (Maki 2009 ). The first Salmonella outbreak occurred between April and August 2008 and was linked to contaminated peppers (and possibly tomatoes) that originated in Mexico and were subsequently processed in the southwest US. The second outbreak, due to S. typhimurium, occurred between October 2008 and March 2009, and was traced to a single peanut processing plant in Georgia (www.cdc.gov/salmonella). The actual number of cases associated with these outbreaks is likely to be 20-30 times greater than the number of cases reported (Maki 2009 ). Contamination of water supplies has had a similar impact on public health. In 1993, an outbreak of waterborne cryptosporidium in Milwaukee, WI affected an estimated 403,000 people (Leclerc et al. 2002) . Enteric infections also pose a significant threat at the local level, in which a food or water source directly accessible to consumers is deliberately adulterated. The best example of such an incident occurred in 1984 in The Dalles, OR, where members of a religious commune intentionally contaminated salad bars at public restaurants with S. typhimurium (Torok et al. 1997) .

In the former case, mucosal immunity is likely to be essential in preventing and clearing infections. Therefore, vaccines against these agents must truly involve mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues. In situations where the mucosa functions solely as a port of entry, systemic immunity is likely to be sufficient to control infection. One such example is anthrax. While B. anthracis spores are highly infectious by aerosol, the vegetative bacteria generally do not proliferate locally. Rather, following inhalation, the bacteria disseminate systemically via the lymphatics and circulatory system. Once within the systemic compartment, B. anthracis germinates and produces two toxins which account for the lethality associated with infection (Leppla et al. 2002) . Protective immunity to B. anthracis is associated primarily with anti-toxin serum IgG antibodies. Mucosal defense is of little (if any) importance in controlling anthrax. On the other hand, mucosal immunity is likely to be important in controlling infections caused by two other Category A bacterial pathogens, notably Y. pestis and F. tularensis, which cause mucosal and systemic complications following inhalation (Metzger et al. 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1018, "end": 1038, "text": "(Leppla et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1478, "text": "(Metzger et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Assessing Degrees of Mucosal Involvement"}, {"text": "For many of the Category A-C agents, transmission via the respiratory tract is considered an ''unnatural'' route of infection and the actual involvement of the mucosa in the pathogenesis of infection may not be currently known. As a consequence, initial host interaction and the subsequent pathophysiology will not necessarily coincide with established clinical outcomes associated with infection by the natural route. In addition, there may be no clinical data that adequately define aerosol-related disease or how it differs from the natural route of infection. An example of one such agent is Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). As a member of the superantigen family of toxins, SEB forms ''bridges'' between Major Histocompatibility Class II molecules on antigen presenting cells and T cell receptors on specific subsets of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. As a consequence of SEB binding, T cells release massive amounts of proinflammatory cytokines and undergo hyper-proliferation which ultimately results in their depletion (Kappler et al. 1989; White et al. 1989) . Staphylococcal enterotoxin B is clinically associated with food poisoning, as ingestion of microgram quantities of the toxin are sufficient to evoke violent vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and, in severe cases, lethal shock (Bergdoll 1983 ). Despite being classified as an enterotoxin, SEB is extremely pathogenic following aerosol challenge. Rhesus monkeys administered SEB as an aerosol suffered from vomiting and diarrhea within hours, and died about two days later (Tseng et al. 1993; Mattix et al. 1995) .

These different manifestations of clinical symptoms and outcome following different routes of exposure have been demonstrated for the Venezuelan and Eastern equine encephalitis viruses (Ryzhikov et al. 1991) . Correspondingly, immunity to the alpha viruses may depend on the route of exposure. While serum IgG antibodies may be effective for neutralizing virus following exposure via subcutaneous injection (similar to a natural exposure), these antibodies may not control viral spread following aerosol challenge. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) rather than humoral immunity may be more important following aerosol challenge.

In this case, systemic immunity may suffice to protect against lethality but may not prevent localized tissue damage in the mucosa.

Ricin is a bipartite toxin capable of intoxicating all known cell types. The ricin toxin B subunit (RTB) is a lectin with specificity for b-1,3 linked galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine residues. The A subunit (RTA) is an RNA N-glycosidase whose substrate is a conserved adenine residue within the so-called sarcin/ricin loop of eukaryotic 28S ribosomal RNA. Monkeys exposed to lethal doses of ricin by aerosol suffered peribronchovascular edema, mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates, and widespread necrosis in the airways and alveoli (Wilhelmsen and Pitt 1996) . Death occurred 36-48 h post exposure. In a rodent model, serum IgG was sufficient to prevent death of animals after a lethal aerosol challenge, but not sufficient to prevent toxin-induced lung lesions (Griffiths et al. 1995) .

The Y. pestis organism is a gram-negative bacillus that can be transmitted by flea-bite or by aerosol. Depending on the mode of transmission and success of infection, three forms of the disease may manifest: bubonic, septicemic, and/or pneumonic plague. Upon flea-bite, the bacterium is introduced into the bloodstream and eventually seeds the nearest lymph nodes. The bacterium is ingested by nonactivated macrophages that are unable to control the growth of the organism. Inflammation produced in response to bacterial proliferation causes a characteristic swelling, or bubo, the classical feature of bubonic plague. Eventually, bacteria can disseminate throughout the bloodstream leading to septicemic plague and the colonization of additional sites. Pneumonic plague can result from dissemination to the lung alveoli or from the inhalation of aerosolized organisms. Pneumonic plague has a very rapid onset (1-3 days). It is highly contagious and approaches a 100% fatality rate if left untreated. Host immune responses ultimately fail to control the growth and dissemination of the organism. Without early antibiotic treatment, death can result from either pneumonia or endotoxin-induced septicemic shock (Cornelius et al. 2007 ). Due to the intrinsic virulence of Y. pestis, its ease of transmission by aerosol, and the lack of a vaccine, this bacterium poses a significant threat to biodefense and is classified as a Category A priority pathogen. The extensive research aimed at producing an effective vaccine against plague has revealed significant contribution of mucosal immunity in protection against the respiratory form of the disease. It has long been recognized that serum antibodies generated against whole-killed Y. pestis can prevent bubonic and septicemic forms of the disease (Smiley 2008) . However, the inability of serum antibody to prevent pneumonic plague led to the hypothesis that local mucosal immunity in the lung may be essential for protection.

The additional presence of antigen-specific IgA in pulmonary fluids may further contribute to protection in the respiratory tract. Survival against aerosolized Y. pestis was enhanced by increasing the nasal boost dosage of rF1-V, and both serum and pulmonary antibody titers to V antigen, were the best predictors of outcome (Reed and Martinez 2006) .

Mucosal immunity appears to be essential for preventing pulmonary inflammation and pneumonia, while systemic immunity is required for preventing bacterial dissemination and septicemia. This is evidenced by vaccine studies in mice that reported rapid, fulminating disease, and endotoxin-induced death in sham-vaccinated animals challenged with aerosolized Y. pestis (Reed and Martinez 2006) . In vaccinated animals that survive the same challenge dose, both systemic and mucosal antibody titers correlate with protection. In contrast, vaccinated animals that eventually succumb to the disease display no evidence of bacterial dissemination from the lung, but develop lethal pneumonia (Reed and Martinez 2006) .

The importance of systemic antibody is also exemplified by the demonstration that passive transfer of F1-V mouse antisera can protect recipient normal or SCID mice from bubonic and pneumonic challenge with Y. pestis (Motin et al. 1994; Anderson et al. 1996; Green et al. 1999 ). However, B-cell deficient mice vaccinated with live Y. pestis are protected against pneumonic plague unless they are additionally depleted of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, IFN-c, or TNF-a (Parent et al. 2005) . Recent studies with nonhuman primates also suggest that F1-V antibodies alone may not solely correlate with protection against pneumonic plague (Smiley 2008) . Thus, induction of cellular immunity may be critical to the development of an effective vaccine against plague.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 574, "end": 598, "text": "(Reed and Martinez 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 892, "end": 916, "text": "(Reed and Martinez 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1280, "text": "(Motin et al. 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1281, "end": 1302, "text": "Anderson et al. 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1303, "end": 1320, "text": "Green et al. 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1507, "end": 1527, "text": "(Parent et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1687, "text": "(Smiley 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Yersinia pestis as a Case Study in Biodefense Vaccine Development"}, {"text": "Due to the likely importance of cellular immunity in preventing pneumonic plague, there is a renewed interest in the development of live-attenuated Y. pestis strains as vaccines (Smiley 2008) .
