            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a new disease which emerged in China in late 2002 and spread rapidly around the world. This epidemic, which resulted in over 8000 infections and almost 800 deaths, raised considerable concerns that this emerging agent constituted a serious threat for global public health. The identification of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) associated with this syndrome [1], [2], [3] raised the possibility of development of a vaccine to prevent infection. Although there have no reports of community-acquired human SARS infections since January 2004, a re-emergence of the disease is still a possibility. The virus remains in animal reservoirs and there is a potential for further spread to humans [4]. Thus, despite the disappearance of the disease in humans, there is still an urgent need for rapid development of a safe and effective vaccine. It is generally considered that live attenuated viruses are the most effective viral vaccines because of their ability to induce strong cellular and humoral immune responses [5]. However, the need for extensive safety testing of such vaccines can delay entry of such candidate vaccines into clinical trials. Multiple studies have reported that antibodies directed against the spike (S) glycoprotein can neutralise SARS-CoV infectivity [6], [7], [8], [9]. The S protein is reported to bind to the human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE-2) protein to mediate viral entry to the cell [10]. Human monoclonal antibodies directed against the S protein have been reported to reduce replication of the virus in the lung of infected ferrets and to completely prevent the development of SARS Co-V induced lung pathology [11]. In addition, a number of candidate vaccines induced protection against challenge with live virus in animal models, and this protection was associated with high levels of neutralising antibody [12], [13], [14]. Thus, it is likely that an inactivated or recombinant candidate vaccine containing the S protein will be able to induce protective immunity based primarily on stimulation of a humoral immune response.",

Interferon-\u03b3 or IL-4, respectively, was detected by a biotinylated interferon-\u03b3 or IL-4 specific antibody followed by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase and development with BCIP/NBT substrate solution. The number of spots was counted using an automated ELISPOT reader (AID, Strassberg, Germany). The number of spots observed in wells containing no antigen was subtracted from the number of spots observed in wells containing specific antigen and the results were expressed as spot forming cells (SFC) per 106 spleen cells.",

This development of a candidate SARS-CoV vaccine was based on adaption of this well established technology, to establish optimal conditions for growth, inactivation and purification of the inactivated virus. The SARS-CoV had been reported to grow well on Vero cells [2], [3], so it was considered that this was probably the optimal cell matrix for rapid vaccine development. A primary virus seed was generated from a human isolate by five sequential plaque clonings. This primary seed was further amplified to generate a seed virus bank, a working virus bank and a production virus bank. The production virus was then used to infect serum protein free cultures using a fermenter volume of 100 l. Following an incubation period of 2\u20133 days, the virus containing supernatant was then harvested and inactivated by 0.05% formalin treatment for 48 h followed by U.V. inactivation with an U.V. dose of 20 mJ/cm2. Virus infection at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.001 resulted in generation of high viral titres (\u223c108\n TCID50/ml) in the supernatant and both the formalin and U.V. inactivation steps were independently capable of inactivating this titre with a large margin of safety (manuscript in preparation).",

For this purpose, groups of 10 mice were immunised twice with decreasing doses of the purified non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted vaccine at doses ranging from 1 \u03bcg to 0.3 ng. To evaluate the effect of adjuvantation on the immunogenicity of the vaccine, a non-adjuvanted preparation and material adjuvanted with 0.05 and 0.2% aluminium hydroxide was tested at each antigen concentration. The S specific antibody titre and neutralising antibody titre for each individual serum was then determined as described in Sections 2.5, 2.6. The geometric mean titre (GMT) determined for each group of animals is presented in Fig. 3\n. These data demonstrate that the candidate vaccine is highly immunogenic in CD1 mice. Following a single immunisation with 1 or 0.2 \u03bcg, S specific antibody titres with GMT up to approximately 1:5000 for the adjuvanted formulations and 1:1000 for the non-adjuvanted formulation were measured 2 weeks after the primary immunisation (data not shown). Neutralising antibody titres were not measured at this time point. Following the booster immunisation, ELISA titres were substantially increased and GMTs of up to 1:400,000 could be obtained with the 1 \u03bcg dosage adjuvanted with 0.2% aluminium hydroxide. Reduction of the dosage to as little as 0.3 ng in an adjuvanted formulation still resulted in the development of a low titre antibody response (Fig. 3A). High titre neutralising antibodies (approximately 1:1000) were also measured for the 0.2 \u03bcg adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted formulations 3 weeks after the booster immunisation (Fig. 3B). Groups of mice immunised with the 0.2% aluminium hydroxide formulations were bled 10 and 11 weeks after booster immunisation and it was demonstrated that high titre S specific and neutralising antibodies were still detected at this stage (Fig. 3C and D).",

We have favoured the strategy of a whole virus vaccine development for a number of reasons, including speed of development. The virus grows to very high titres in Vero cells, a cell line accepted by most regulatory authorities. A similar technology used for this development has been utilised for development and industrial scale production of an influenza virus vaccine [15]. Manufacturing facilities are also in place at the appropriate biosafety level to utilise this technology for rapid large scale vaccine production. However, in addition to these technology and logistical reasons, it is also likely that an inactivated whole virus vaccine would be most efficient in inducing neutralising antibodies, which are possibly critical in preventing SARS-CoV infection.",

There have been reports of inactivation failures associated with both of these methodologies even in the recent past [23]. We have therefore developed a strategy involving a double inactivation process utilising formaldehyde and U.V. inactivations. Although formaldehyde is reported to react with protein and nucleic acid the reactions with nucleic acid, particularly when the nucleic acid is a component of a virus particle, are less well established. Therefore we have decided to introduce a second inactivation step in addition to formaldehyde, i.e. U.V. inactivation, directed primarily against nucleic acid. Both of these processes were independently demonstrated to be capable of inactivating >108\n TCID50/ml with a large margin of safety (manuscript in preparation).",

Dose finding and adjuvant studies were carried out in mice with measurement of antibody responses by S specific ELISA and infectivity neutralising titres. The data presented in Fig. 3 demonstrated that the double inactivated preparation was highly immunogenic with S specific ELISA titres of up to 1:400,000 being obtained following two immunisations with 1 \u03bcg antigen adjuvanted with 0.2% aluminum hydroxide. High neutralising titres were also obtained following an immunisation and booster with 0.2 \u03bcg antigen, with titres of approximately 1:1000 being obtained. This immunogenicity appears to be higher than that reported for other whole virus vaccines subjected to a single inactivation step, although differences in methodologies make direct comparisons difficult [20], [21]. The double inactivated vaccine was also able to induce very high antibody responses even in the absence of adjuvant. This is similar to data reported for an U.V. inactivated vaccine [21] and for a \u03b2-propiolactone inactivated vaccine [20] where little difference in the level of neutralising antibodies in mice was reported. The minimal influence of adjuvantation on vaccine immunogenicity was also confirmed in these studies by calculation of the E.D.50. There was little difference in E.D.50 of the non-adjuvanted and 0.2% alum adjuvanted material although the 0.05% alum adjuvanted material appeared to be more immunogenic (Table 1A). However, this was not confirmed when the E.D.50 was calculated on the basis of neutralising antibody responses, with the non-adjuvanted material being more immunogenic than the preparation with 0.05% alum (Table 1B).",

The vaccine appeared to be effective at very low doses of antigen: calculation of the P.D.50 (Table 3) for non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted vaccines confirmed that very low antigen concentrations (approximately 1 ng) were sufficient to provide protection of 50% of immunised mice. This figure is even lower than that calculated for highly effective well-established Flavivirus vaccines such as tick-borne encephalitis which has a calculated P.D.50 of 32 ng in a similar model.
