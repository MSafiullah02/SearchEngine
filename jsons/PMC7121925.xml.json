Delay in identification of the cause of ARF and the initiation of the appropriate therapy may further increase mortality. The most common cause of ARF in cancer patients is pulmonary infections , as a result of the immunosuppression posed by the underlying disease or the cancer therapy. Other frequent causes include cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]), antineoplastic therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy)-induced lung injury, cancer-related medical disorders (such as venous thromboembolism, transfusion-related acute lung injury), and direct involvement of the respiratory system by malignancy and progression of underlying disease.",

Several factors increase the risk of infection in those patients, including chemotherapy, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression, multiple hospital admissions, and exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics [9]. Causative pathogen depends on the underlying immune state. In patients with impaired humoral immunity, such as those with acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myelomas, and are the predominantly isolated organisms. In patients with impaired cell-mediated (T-cell) immunity as those with Hodgkin disease or those therapy with corticosteroids, the predominantly isolated organisms are Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) , followed by mycobacteria, , , and viral infections (mainly herpes virus and ). Neutropenic patients are usually infected by gram-positive cocci ( and ), gram-negative enteric bacilli ( and ), or opportunistic fungi (mainly Aspergillus\n)\u2014especially in the case of prolonged neutropenia [9, 10]. When evaluating pneumonia in patients with cancer, determining the level and the duration of immunosuppression, the previous exposure to antimicrobials (over the last month), the length of the illness, the presenting symptoms, and the radiographic pattern will better predict the suspected pathogens.

However, in the setting of neutropenia, clinical diagnosis is often jeopardized by nontypical clinical findings [11]. Sputum production is seen in less than 60% of neutropenic patients, while in severe neutropenia (neutrophils <1000 cells/mm3), purulent sputum is present in less than 8% of patients. Routine clinical examination often reveals rales and signs of consolidation. To determinate the cause of pneumonia, blood cultures should be performed routinely; however, the results may be of limited value. Similarly, sputum analysis is often low yield, and the results are difficult to interpret. Identifying the exact cause of pneumonia in patients with cancer often requires fiberoptic bronchoscopy with BAL as sputum is seldom produced. The overall diagnostic yield of BAL in neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients with suspected pneumonia is 49% and 63%, respectively [12]. Chest X-ray findings of bacterial pneumonia in cancer patients are nonspecific. The initial chest radiograph may be normal (mainly in neutropenic patients) or demonstrate lobar consolidation (usually missing in neutropenic patients) and diffuse interstitial infiltrates.",

Secondary ARDS is related to a systemic process such as severe sepsis or septic shock from extrapulmonary bacterial or fungal infections.

Mortality in oncologic patients with ARDS remains high although a significant decrease has been recorded over the time.

In most cases, clinical manifestation consists of hypoxemia, tachycardia, tachypnea, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and profuse diaphoresis. Hypotension may present and indicate severe LV systolic dysfunction and the possibility of cardiogenic shock. Pink, frothy sputum may be present in patients with severe disease. In regard to routine clinical examination, auscultation of the lungs usually reveals fine, crepitant rales (most commonly heard at the lung bases), but rhonchi or wheezes may also be present, while cardiovascular findings are notable for S3, accentuation of the pulmonic component of S2, and jugular venous distention.",

Plasma levels of the B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its amino-terminal fragment N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) have been shown to be useful, in addition to clinical judgment, for the etiological diagnosis in patients with acute onset of dyspnea, and should be measured in all patients with ARF and suspected CPE. BNP has a high negative predictive value, and being lower than the recommended cutoff value of 100 pg/mL in patients with suspected CPE makes the diagnosis unlikely [39]. A bedside echocardiogram in a patient with CPE remains the cornerstone in determining the etiology of pulmonary edema. Echocardiography can be used to evaluate LV systolic and diastolic function, as well as valvular function, and to assess for pericardial disease.",
