We try to combine mathematical physics and biology into a picoscope of life. For this we merge techniques which have been introduced and developed in modern mathematical physics, largely by Ludvig Faddeev to describe objects such as solitons and Higgs and to explain phenomena such as anomalies in gauge fields. We propose a synthesis that can help to resolve the protein folding problem, one of the most important conundrums in all of science. We apply the concept of gauge invariance to scrutinize the extrinsic geometry of strings in three dimensional space. We evoke general principles of symmetry in combination with Wilsonian universality and derive an essentially unique Landau-Ginzburg energy that describes the dynamics of a generic string-like configuration in the far infrared. We observe that the energy supports topological solitons, that pertain to an anomaly in the manner how a string is framed around its inflection points. We explain how the solitons operate as modular building blocks from which folded proteins are composed. We describe crystallographic protein structures by multi-solitons with experimental precision, and investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of proteins under varying temperature. We simulate the folding process of a protein at in vivo speed and with close to pico-scale accuracy using a standard laptop computer: With pico-biology as mathematical physics' next pursuit, things can only get better.",

Dirac introduced his equation in 1928. Maybe he already had quantum gravity in his mind; it has been stated in exalted circles that this is a problem settled by string theory. A resolution to the second Dirac problem, the nature of atomic nuclei, took almost half-a-century of collective efforts to develop. We now trust that LHC experiments at CERN demonstrate how all four known fundamental interactions are governed by the Standard Model of Weinberg-Salam and quantum chromodynamics, plus Einstein's gravity.

We also remind that the shape of a string does not depend on the way how we frame it. Accordingly, the energy of a string can only engage manifestly frame independent combinations of the curvature and torsion (20) . Since (3) is the universal SO(2)\u223cU(1) invariant energy function that involves a complex Higgs field \u03c6 \u223c \u03ba and a gauge field A \u223c \u03c4 , it must serve as the Hamiltonian that describes strings and their dynamics in the far infrared.

Moreover, the explicit profile (43) is both positive and negative, and vanishes at s = s 0 . Thus the consequences of \u03ba = 0 for a string deserves to be investigated. For this it can be profitable to extend the Frenet curvature \u03ba(s) so that it takes both positive and negative values.

Moreover, perestroika's relate to the frame anomaly which is a structural attribute of a string. This identifies perestroika's as those bifurcations, that drive string-specific phase transitions which involve structural re-organizations. In particular, perestroika's prompt topological solitons such as (43) to come and go along a string. Such processes are commonplace whenever we have an energy function of the form (44) .

The problem endures as one of the most important unresolved problems in science, it aims to explain what is life. The Sampo would be a theoretical and computational framework, that predicts the shape and describes the dynamics of a protein in its biological environment. The scale, complexity and trophy of the endeavor are enormous: There are some 25 million protein sequences that have been identified through DNA sequencing.

Apparently, the average cost of a structure determination by x-ray crystallography is around 100 kUSD and crystallization of a protein can sometimes take even years, if at all possible. We can hardly expect that the structures of a much larger percentage of sequences can ever be determined using the presently available experimental techniques.

The equations are numerically integrated with a time step around a femtosecond, which is the characteristic time scale of peptide bond vibrations. Using purpose built supercomputers like Anton [43, 44] and distributed computing projects like folding@home [45] , the speediest MD simulations can reach a few micro-seconds of in vivo folding time, in a day in silico [44] .

Accordingly we need some 10 11 orders of magnitude more in computer speed before MD simulations of proteins like myoglobin will take place in silico at the speed of life.

As a consequence several essential all-atom ingredients still remain to be tackled by implicit and effective methods in lieu of all-atom. An important example is acidity, in case of explicit water. The proper level of acidity is pivotal to numerous biological processes. Sometimes even a slight shift in acidity leads to a major change in protein structure and function. A good example is amylin [53] . It is a short polypeptide hormone that has been implicated in the onset of type-II diabetes. Much remains to be done to understand how amylin functions. In order to comprehensively mimic its properties computationally, one needs to perform simulations that model amylin both inside the \u03b2-cell granules of pancreas where pH \u2248 5.5, and in the extra-cellular domain with pH \u2248 7.4 and where the disease causing amyloidosis takes place; plus through the cell membrane. The structure of amylin seems to be very different, in the two different pH environs. For an all-atom simulation to tackle the difference, suppose we introduce 10 9 explicit water molecules which is 4-5 orders of magnitude more than what is presently possible, even with Anton. However, this only gives leeway for a mere few tens of explicit hydronium ions, to model the physiological pH \u2248 7.4 at all-atom level.

From this perspective the protein folding problem sounds like doomed to endure among the pre-eminent unresolved conundrums in science, for a long time to come. However, this enormous gap between the speed of life and the available speed in silico is also an excellent opportunity: There is a vast Every Man's Land available for the development of alternative, computationally effective approaches. For this purpose, various coarse-grained models are being developed. Contributions to the allatom force fields that are presumed to be less relevant, are systematically eliminated. A simplified geometry can also be used. For example, the UNRES [47] force field provides a very detailed and finely tuned coarse grained potential energy with some 15 different terms, in combination with a simplified geometry. Present coarse-graining can extend all-atom MD simulations by some 4-5 orders of magnitude.

The basic idea is to utilize properly chosen fragments that are found in the protein conformations which have already been deposited in the PDB database, as modular building blocks very much like Lego bricks to construct a folded protein.

For this purpose diverse thermostats have been developed. They facilitate the MD simulation of protein folding, mostly under stationary non-equilibrium conditions. It remains a delicate challenge to construct a purely Hamiltonian thermostat that both models the canonical ensemble of the original system, and allows for a computationally effective discretization for speedy reliable simulations. Thermostatting often involves a deformation of the all-atom Newton's equation into a Langevin equation. However, such an equation is both non-deterministic and lacks timeirreversibility, and the original impetus to consider a Hamiltonian framework becomes lost.",

In our simulations of near-equilibrium proteins, we renormalize the numerical value of the temperature factor kT so that it coincides with the experimentally observed \u03b8-point temperature [64] . We proceed as follows: We start by training (64) , (65) to describe a given, typically very low temperature crystallographic PDB protein configuration as a multi-soliton. For this we utilize the program Propro that we have described in (78). Once the multi-soliton has been constructed, we subject it to extensive heating and cooling simulations. We start from a vanishingly low temperature value, with no apparent thermal fluctuations in the C\u03b1 positions. We slowly increase the temperature until we observe a structural transition akin a phase transition, above which the configuration resembles a random walker. The transition identifies the renormalization point of the temperature factor, it takes place at the \u03b8-point temperature.

The compactness index \u03bd is a universal quantity but the form factor R 0 is not. The form factor is in principle a calculable quantity, from the atomic level structure of the protein and the surrounding solvent. In figure 8 we show, as an example, how the C\u03b1 root-mean-square-distance (RMSD) between the crystallographic X-ray myoglobin structure with PDB entry code 1ABS and its multi-soliton description constructed using (64), (65) evolves, when we increase and decrease the temperature. In this simulation we first heat up the multi-soliton. We thermalize it in the \u03b8-regime. We then cool it down, back to low temperature values where only very small thermal motion persist.",

In particular, there are many high energy barriers that the protein must be able to overcome as it progresses from a random string towards the native fold. This obligates thousands of atoms to cooperate over quite long time periods, so that complex collective multi-molecule motions can take place and enable the conformation to cross the various steep hurdles and hindrances. These obstacles that come with varying scales and diverse structures, pose major computational bottle-necks in any all-atom approach to the protein folding problem. Thus, a detailed MD simulation of the entire folding process remains a formidable task.

Thus we need an extension of the general results to the specific case of a piecewise linear string: We continue to interpret a change in the sign of \u03c4 i in terms of a flattening point. It suggests that an inflection point perestroika has taken place. Accordingly, we implement a series of Z 2 gauge transformations(63) in the vicinity of putative flattening points where \u03c4 i changes sign or is otherwise unsettled, to identify the putative multi-soliton profile in \u03ba i . For example, in the case of 1LMB there are four regions with an irregular \u03c4 i profile. By a judicious choice of Z 2 gauge transformations we identify seven different solitons (69) in \u03ba i . The profiles are shown infigure 6. Each of the soliton profile is clearly accompanied by putative flattening points; note the multivaluedness of \u03c4 i . The general considerations in Sections X and XI, albeit developed for the case of continuous strings, are very much in line with the analysis of a generic discrete C\u03b1 protein profile. We conclude that protein folding is due to inflection and flattening point perestroika's. These bifurcations deform the C\u03b1 backbone and create DNLS solitons along it.",
