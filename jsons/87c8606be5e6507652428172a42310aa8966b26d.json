The legal DOI is based on experimental evidence, represents a minimum value and need not reflect the true DOI of a vaccine. Most companion animal vaccines, until recently, had a 1 year DOI and carried a recommendation for annual revaccination. The sensible response of industry to recent discussions about vaccine safety has been to increasingly license products with an 'extended' (generally 3 year) DOI. However, for most core vaccines (see below) the true DOI is likely to be considerably longer.",

Consequently, guidelines advice will often differ from that given in the data sheet; however, any veterinarian may use a vaccine according to guidelines (and therefore current scientific thinking) by obtaining informed (and documented) owner consent for this deviation from legal recommendations ('off-label use').

There is little doubt that in most developed countries the major infectious diseases of dogs and cats are considered at best uncommon in the pet population, but there do remain geographical pockets of infection and sporadic outbreaks of disease occur, and the situation regarding feral or shelter populations is distinctly different to that in owned pet animals. However, in many developing countries these key infectious diseases remain as common as they once were in developed nations and a major cause of mortality in small animals. Although it is difficult to obtain accurate figures, even in developed countries it is estimated that only 30-50% of the pet animal population is vaccinated, and this is significantly less in developing nations. In small animal medicine, we have been slow to grasp the concept of 'herd immunity'-that vaccination of individual pet animals is important, not only to protect the individual, but to reduce the number of susceptible animals in the regional population, and thus the prevalence of disease. Herd immunity with the core vaccines that provide a long (many years) DOI is highly dependent on the percentage of animals in the population vaccinated and not the number of vaccinations that occur annually. Therefore, every effort should be made to vaccinate a higher percentage of cats and dogs with the core vaccines.",

For that reason we have seen the development of vaccination guidelines based on a rational analysis of the vaccine requirements for each pet, and the proposal that vaccines be considered 'core' and 'non-core' in nature. To an extent this categorization of products has been based on available scientific evidence and personal experience -but concerted effort to introduce effective companion animal disease surveillance on a global scale would provide a more definitive basis on which to recommend vaccine usage. In parallel with the categorization of vaccines has been the push towards marketing products with extended DOI, to reduce the unnecessary administration of vaccines and thereby further improve vaccine safety. Both of these changes have necessitated a frame-shift in the mindset of veterinary practitioners in a culture in which both veterinarian and client have become subservient to the mantra of annual vaccination.",

In situations where, for example, a decision must be made that an individual pet may have to receive only a single core vaccination during its lifetime, the VGG would emphasize that this should optimally be given at a time when that animal is most capable of responding immunologically, i.e. at the age of 16 weeks or greater.",

The VGG considers that a core vaccine is one that all puppies throughout the world must receive in order to provide protection against infectious diseases of global significance. The VGG recognizes that particular countries will identify additional vaccines that they consider core. A particular example of a vaccine that may be considered core in only some countries is that against rabies virus. In a geographical area in which this infection is endemic all dogs should be routinely vaccinated for the protection of both the pet and human populations. In some countries, mandatory rabies vaccination is a legal requirement, and is generally also required for international pet travel. Non-core vaccines are those that are licensed for the dog and whose use is determined on the basis of the animal's geographical and lifestyle exposure and an assessment of risk-benefit ratios. Not recommended vaccines are those for which there is little scientific justification for their use.",

No single primary vaccination policy will therefore cover all possible situations. The recommendation of the VGG is for initial vaccination at 8-9 weeks of age followed by a second vaccination 3-4 weeks later, and a third vaccination given between 14-16 weeks of age. By contrast, at present many vaccine data sheets recommend an initial course of two injections. Some products are also licensed with a '10 week finish' designed such that the second of two vaccinations is given at 10 weeks of age. The rationale behind this protocol is to permit 'early socialization' of pups. The VGG recognizes that this is of great benefit to the behavioural development of dogs. Where such protocols are adopted, great caution should still be maintained by the owner -allowing restricted exposure of the pup to controlled areas and only to other pups that are healthy and fully vaccinated. The VGG recommends that whenever possible a third dose of core vaccine be given at 14-16 weeks of age.",

Therapeutically, the serum or immunoglobulin preparations are injected subcutaneously and quickly reach the circulation.

In local infections, such as those initiated by the bite wound of a rabid carnivore, post-exposure antibody prophylaxis has also proven invaluable.

The vaccine is a subunit product containing GP63 of L. donovani (also known as the 'fucose mannose ligand') in saponin adjuvant. It is considered to induce antibody that 9 blocks the transmission of the organism from the dog to the sand fly vector by preventing binding of Leishmania to the midgut of the sand fly. The vaccine appears compatible with serological testing to identify infected dogs, as only 1.3% of 5860 vaccinated uninfected animals were positive in the tests used in that screening programme. More importantly, large scale epidemiological studies have shown that vaccination has an additive effect to the culling programme with regions having high uptake of vaccination showing reduced incidence of both canine and human infection (Palatnik de Sousa et al., 2009 ).

In some countries, mandatory rabies vaccination is a legal requirement, and is generally also required for international pet travel. In terms of feline core vaccines it is important to realize that the protection afforded by the FCV and FHV-1 vaccines will not provide the same efficacy of immunity as seen with the FPV vaccines.

However, without serological testing, the level of protection and the point at which the kitten will become susceptible to infection and/or can respond immunologically to vaccination is unknown. This is related to the level of maternal antibody and variation in uptake of MDA between litters. In general, MDA will have waned by 8-12 weeks of age to a level that allows an active immunological response, and an initial vaccination at 8-9 weeks of age followed by a second vaccination 3-4 weeks later is commonly recommended. Many vaccines carry data sheet recommendations to this effect. However, kittens with poor MDA may be vulnerable (and capable of responding to vaccination) at an earlier age, while others may possess MDA at such high titres that they are incapable of responding to vaccination until sometime after 12 weeks of age.

Accordingly the recommendation 'left leg leukaemia, right leg rabies' suggested that FeLV vaccine should be given as far distal as possible into the left hind limb, whilst rabies vaccine should be given as far distal as possible into the right hind limb. A recent study has evaluated the effect of this practice by comparing the anatomical distribution of FISS in cats before the recommendation was made (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) and after the practice was adopted (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) . These data show a significant decrease in the prevalence of interscapular FISS and an increase in prevalence of tumours in the right (but not left) hind limb. More notably, there was also an increase in the number of tumours reported arising in the right and left lateral abdomen, and this was attributed to the difficultly of injecting into the distal hindlimb and these abdominal sites being accidentally injected (Shaw et al., 2009 ).",

In many countries governmental surveillance schemes are not available and reactions should therefore be notified to the manufacturer.

The VGG would actively encourage all veterinarians to participate in such surveillance schemes.",

In addition, reported adverse events can lead to detection of previously unrecognized reactions, detection of increases in known reactions, recognition of risk factors associated with reactions, identification of vaccine lots with unusual events or higher numbers of adverse events, and can further stimulate clinical, epidemiological, or laboratory studies. Therefore, veterinarians are encouraged to report any clinically significant adverse event occurring during or after administration of any licensed vaccine. Reporting a vaccine adverse event is not an indictment against a particular vaccine; it facilitates review of temporally associated conditions and adds to the safety database of the product. ",

Although the development of an adverse reaction is often dependent on the genetics of the animal (e.g. small breed dogs or families of dogs), certain vaccines have a higher likelihood of producing adverse reactions, especially reactions caused by Type I hypersensitivity. For example, bacterins (killed bacterial vaccines), such as Leptospira, Bordetella, Borrelia and Chlamydophila are more likely to cause these adverse reactions than MLV viral vaccines.",

If the vaccine is an optional non-core vaccine (e.g. Leptospira or Bordetella bacterin) revaccination is discouraged. For rabies, the local authorities must be consulted to determine whether the rabies vaccine is to be administered by law or whether antibody titre may be determined as an alternative.",

Hypersensitivity reactions are known to be related to excipients contained within the vaccine (e.g. traces of bovine serum albumin used in the virus culture process). The use of antihistamines pre-revaccination is acceptable and does not interfere with the vaccinal immune response. Revaccinated susceptible animals should be closely monitored for up to 24 hours post-vaccination although such reactions (Type 1 hypersensitivity) generally occur within minutes of exposure. Other types of hypersensitivity (II, III, IV) can occur much later (e.g. hours to months).",

Determining the frequency of adverse reactions relies upon the veterinarian or owner reporting such reactions to the manufacturer or national authority (where such routes exist). It is currently accepted that the vaccines that we use are very safe with a very low incidence of possible side effects. The benefits of protection from serious infectious disease far outweigh the risks of developing an adverse reaction. Recent analysis of a major US hospital group database has allowed publication of data based on very large numbers of vaccinated dogs and cats. Adverse reactions (of any kind, including very minor reactions) were documented within the first 3 days following vaccination in 38 of 10,000 vaccinated dogs. Adverse reactions (of any kind, including very minor reactions) were documented within the first 30 days",
