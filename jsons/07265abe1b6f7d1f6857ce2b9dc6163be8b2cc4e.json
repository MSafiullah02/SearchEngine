While this positions glycans as being essential for understanding and targeting host-pathogen interactions, their considerable diversity and a lack of methods has hitherto stymied progress in leveraging their predictive potential. Here, we utilize a curated dataset of 12,674 glycans from 1,726 species to develop and apply machine learning methods to extract evolutionary information from glycans. Our deep learning-based language model SweetOrigins provides evolution-informed glycan representations that we utilize to discover and investigate motifs used for molecular mimicrymediated immune evasion by commensals and pathogens. Novel glycan alignment methods enable us to identify and contextualize virulence-determining motifs in the capsular polysaccharide of Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Further, we show that glycan-based phylogenetic trees contain most of the information present in traditional 16S rRNA-based phylogenies and improve on the differentiation of genetically closely related but phenotypically divergent species, such as Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis. Leveraging the evolutionary information inherent in glycans with machine learning methodology is poised to provide furthercritically needed -insights into host-pathogen interactions, sequence-to-function relationships, and the major influence of glycans on phenotypic plasticity.",

Apart from influencing the function of individual proteins, glycans are also crucial for cell-cell contact 4 and mediate essential developmental processes 5 . Although glycans are synthesized by specific, DNA-encoded enzymes 6 , an individual glycan sequence is dependent on an intricate interplay between multiple enzymes and cellular conditions, providing glycans with important roles in phenotypic plasticity. Different glycosylation sites, even on the same protein, can exhibit considerable glycoform heterogeneity, depending on accessibility and glycosyltransferase kinetics, as has been shown for protein disulfide isomerase 7 .

To achieve this objective, we curated a comprehensive dataset comprising speciesspecific evolutionary information for 12,674 glycans that we used for motif analyses as well as biomining. These data, together with our previously described glycan dataset 14 , equipped us with a large database, GlycoBase, that is amenable to programmatic access and integration into deep learning pipelines. We leveraged the evolutionary information gained by SweetOrigins to identify and analyze glycan motifs used for molecular mimicry-mediated immune evasion by commensals and pathogens, such as the Lewis blood antigens. Utilizing glycan alignments, we also discovered and contextualized motifs relevant for pathogenicity, with the example of the enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) and capsular polysaccharides of Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Additionally, we used both glycan alignments and evolution-informed glycan representations to construct phylogenetic trees based on glycan sequences alone. Glycan-based phylogenies recovered most of the information contained in 16S rRNA-based phylogenies and outperformed DNA phylogenies for differentiating genetically similar species with diverging phenotypes, such as Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis. As we will describe below, SweetOrigins and our glycan-based phylogenies offer a powerful approach for including phenotypic plasticity into phylogeny and discovering as well as contextualizing functional motifs involved in pathogenicity.",

Leveraging information from UniCarbKB, the Carbohydrate Structure Database (CSDB), and targeted literature  searches equipped us with 12,674 glycan sequences and their species association (see Methods;  Supplementary Table 1) , containing thousands of diverse glycans absent from our previously reported sequence dataset 14 . Combining both datasets (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 2 ) nearly doubled the number of unique glycoletters (monosaccharides or bonds) present in glycans from 602 to 1,027 and those of glycowords (i.e., extracted trisaccharides) from 8,843 to 15,155 unique glycowords, which can be further increased to 19,866 glycowords by considering isomorphic glycans ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Not only was the vocabulary of utilized glycowords larger in the combined dataset, the increase of observed glycoletters now allowed for the theoretical formation of more than one trillion possible glycowords. This, together with the fact that we only observe ~0.0000013% of these glycowords in our dataset, indicates that there is substantially more diversity in unknown glycans. Equipped with this extensive dataset, we set out to analyze the characteristic local structural environments of glycoletters ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). With the monosaccharide fucose as an example, we observed Nacetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and galactose (Gal) as typical connected monosaccharides (Fig. 1b) , concordant with the fucosyltransferase substrate specificities annotated in glycosyltransferase family 10 17 . Additionally, we ascertained that fucose had an overall higher likelihood of occurring in the main branch of a glycan rather than its side branches. This information, together with the sharp drop-off in observed binding after galactose, could be useful in future efforts to reconstruct glycan sequences based on maximum likelihood inferences, as most glycoletter combinations will lack corresponding glycosyltransferases and therefore be highly unlikely, as also indicated by the clear separation of glycoword clusters in embedding space ( Supplementary Fig. 3-4) . 14 (v1) was merged with glycan sequences including species information from CSDB (carbohydrate structure database), UniCarbKB, and the peer-reviewed scientific literature. This resulted in an expanded database (v2) that not only contained additional glycan sequences but also more associated metadata, such as species or linkage information. b, Analyzing the local structural context of glycoletters. As an example, we ordered the frequency of all monosaccharides following fucose in the glycans present in our dataset, highlighting its characteristic local structural context together with its likely position in the glycan structure (main versus side branch). c, Utilizing link libraries for glycan biomining hypothesis generation. For all glycans in our database with species information, we constructed a library of disaccharide motifs that are present in any species to generate leads for glycosyltransferase biomining. d, Glycan sensitivity analysis. Given a glycan sequence, we exhaustively performed in silico modification, only retaining substitutions that resulted in observed glycowords. The number of allowed substitutions at any position was used to calculate sequence variance by normalizing to the total amount of observed monosaccharides or bonds. Glycans are drawn in accordance with the symbol nomenclature for glycans (SNFG).",

Importantly, identifying targets for biomining based on reaction products represents an orthogonal approach to current methods of searching for enzyme DNA sequences homologous to known glycosyltransferases. Analogous to protein engineering, knowing which regions of a biopolymer to modify is crucial. Thus, we performed in silico modification of glycan sequences (see Methods) to assess how conserved a given region of a glycan was. These sensitivity analyses revealed positions in glycans that are near-constant, together with regions such as the non-reducing end that show high variance (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 6 ). As conserved sequences are more likely to be functionally relevant, future glycoengineering efforts could profit from focusing on these variable regions and avoid changes to conserved, potentially functionally relevant glycan regions.",

Our labeled dataset contained glycans from 1,726 species from 39 taxonomic phyla, representing a comprehensive snapshot of currently known species-specific glycans ( Fig. 2a-h) . Taking into account the hierarchical nature of taxonomy, we developed SweetOrigins, a multiclass classifier trained on glycan sequences with the same base model architecture on every taxonomic level (Fig. 2i) . By initializing SweetOrigins with glycoword embeddings learned by SweetTalk, trained on a larger, unlabeled set of glycans, our resulting models achieved high levels of validation accuracy and Matthew's correlation coefficients (MCCs) on all taxonomic levels (Table 1) . We further employed data augmentation by capitalizing on the notion of glycans as graphs and formed a set of isomorphic graphs comprising slightly different lists of glycowords (Fig. 2j) . This led to model performance improvements at every classification level, with absolute accuracy increases of up to six percent, and could make glycan models more robust in general, analogous to data augmentation in image classification 18 .

In general, our predictions were robust and any misclassifications occurred among closely related taxonomic groups, including some fungal glycans falsely predicted to be derived from bacteria on the kingdom level ( Fig.  3b ) and Firmicutes glycans mislabeled as those of Proteobacteria on the phylum level (Fig. 3c ). As glycan embeddings can be constructed from models trained on every taxonomic level, we quantified embedding distances across models from different taxonomic levels ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ).

In the evolutionary embeddings, Fuc(\u03b11-2)Gal is enriched in the vertebrate O-linked glycans and surrounding bacterial glycans. Indeed, bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori synthesize blood group antigens to escape the human immune system by molecular mimicry 25 . Mice lacking the critical galactoside 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2), and thus lacking the corresponding Lewis blood antigen, are largely resistant to H. pylori infection 26 . Other instances of molecular mimicry of host glycans 11 suggest a broader role of this phenomenon and point to an important opportunity for the approach presented here to identify mimicry motifs as well as the commensal and pathogens exhibiting them. Notably, we identified many additional pathogens or parasites, such as the nematodes Dirofilaria immitis and Toxocara canis, with Fuc(\u03b11-2)Gal in their glycans, potentially as molecular mimicry ( Supplementary Fig. 11 ).",

Based on our expansive dataset comprising 1,027 monosaccharides or bonds, alignments of highly diverse bacterial glycans are also possible. To demonstrate this, we aligned the serotype 5 capsular polysaccharide of the clinically relevant pathogen S. aureus, that is known to increase bacterial virulence 28 , against our entire dataset (Fig. 4a) . Notably, the best alignments were achieved with the enterobacterial common antigen (ECA), conserved in the Enterobacteriaceae family, that has been shown to be important for virulence 29 and outer membrane permeability 30 . This alignment result is supported by experiments demonstrating that ECA deficiency in E. coli can be complemented by the expression of enzymes from serotype 5 S. aureus 31 . Given that the capsular polysaccharides of S. aureus mediate its evasion of the immune system 32 , any insight into shared epitopes with the commensals from the Enterobacteriaceae family is potentially valuable for understanding and combating its pathogenicity.

A dendrogram resulting from alignment distances is shown together with ECA-like sequences and their species of origin. c, Phylogenetic ensemble tree of Bacilli based on glycan alignments and embeddings. For all species in the taxonomic class Bacilli with at least five glycans in our dataset, we averaged their embedding as well as alignment distances and used hierarchical clustering to construct a phylogenetic tree, visualized by Interactive Tree of Life v5.5 33 . Species are colored according to their taxonomic order and clusters attributable to a taxonomic order are colored as well. d, Phylogenetic tree of Bacilli using 16S rRNA alignment. Based on multiple sequence alignments, the phylogenetic tree for Bacilli in our dataset, derived from neighbor joining, is shown and colored according to (c). e, Topological distance between phylogenetic trees of Bacilli. Branch lengthaware topological distance, as implemented in the R package ape 34 (version 5.3), was calculated between the 16S rRNA-based Bacilli phylogeny and all glycan-based trees reported in this work. f, Using SweetOrigins and glycan alignments to predict evolutionary origin of unlabeled glycans. Glycan sequences are used as inputs for trained SweetOrigins models as well as for exhaustive pairwise alignment. The first instance of concordance between both modalities is used as a taxonomic prediction of the origin of any given glycan.",

The evolutionary information in glycans, in addition to its utility for predicting the origin of a given glycan of interest, could also serve as a basis for a glycan-based phylogeny, describing the relationships between taxa. Phylogenetic trees commonly utilize a distance-based measure to determine branching. Accordingly, we used the distance between glycan embeddings derived from SweetOrigins as a measure of evolutionary distance. Glycans, in contrast to genes, are too diverse to identify sequences that are shared by a large swath of the evolutionary spectrum and that could be used as phylogenetic markers. Thus, we calculated the average glycan embedding for every species as a characteristic snapshot of its glycome. In addition to providing a basis for an evolutionary distance, this approach allowed us to disentangle viral glycans from those of their hosts, which were indistinguishable on the level of individual glycans. While every single viral glycan is host-derived, the sum of viral glycans only presents a subset of the host glycome and therefore results in different average glycome embeddings ( Supplementary Fig. 13 ). Performing hierarchical clustering on the resulting distance matrix enabled us to construct a glycan-based evolutionary tree for the well-studied taxonomic class of Bacilli in the phylum Firmicutes ( Supplementary  Fig. 14a) , containing several important commensals and pathogens; this allowed us to observe a partial disentanglement of the constituting taxonomic orders Lactobacillales and Bacillales.",

The notable bisection of Lactobacillales and Bacillales by this phylogenetic tree clearly supported our ensemble tree based on glycans, demonstrating that a purely glycan-based phylogeny is not only feasible but also highly informative. By quantifying the topological difference between the 16S rRNA-based phylogeny and glycan-based phylogenetic trees, we could again establish the superiority of the ensemble approach over using either glycan embeddings or alignments separately (Fig. 4e) . Interestingly, the common food and soil microbe Bacillus cereus was indistinguishable from the causative agent of anthrax, Bacillus anthracis, on the 16S rRNA level, yet was readily differentiated by the glycanbased phylogeny. Based on DNA sequencing, it has even been suggested that B. cereus, B. anthracis, and the agriculturally relevant B. thuringiensis, should be aggregated into a single species 37 . While these bacteria only differ by their acquired plasmids, they differ dramatically in their phenotype. This difference is reflected in their glycans, as one of the differences between these bacteria is the expression of additional glycosyltransferases by B. anthracis 38 . As such, seemingly minor differences at the genetic level are translated into large differences at the glycan level, reinforcing the need for a glycan-based phylogeny as a differentiator of species such as B. cereus and B. anthracis. As seen with molecular mimicry, glycans can be an essential constituent of pathogenicity and therefore are important for the phenotypic distinction between closely related species, underlining the importance of the glycan-based phylogeny approach presented here.",

Additional steps to exclude duplicated glycans included strict ordering of multiple branches with equal lengths by ascending connection to the main branch (e.g., branch ending in '\u03b11-2' before branch ending in '\u03b21-4' Data processing for model training, as previously described 14 , included featurization of glycan sequences into pure characters (e.g., 'G', 'a', 'l'), glycoletters (e.g., 'Gal'), as well as glycowords (three monosaccharides connected by two bonds).

Further, only classes comprising at least five glycans were used for training and testing the model. We employed data augmentation by forming a generalizable subset of all possible isomorphic glycans, if a glycan sequence had isomorphic glycans. Specifically, we swapped the order of double branches and exhaustively exchanged the main branch with the side branches closest to the non-reducing end.
