Bovin (Moscow, Russia). The \u03b11,2-specific \u03b1-fucosidase II from Xantomonas manihotis was obtained from Glyko (Upper Heyford, UK). The BG-4 anti-H type 1 specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) was purchased from Signet Pathology Systems (Dedham, MA). mAbs 19-OLE and 3-3A were from Dr. J. Bara (Paris, France). 19-OLE is an anti-H type 2 that shows a slight cross-reactivity with Lewis Y (unpublished results), and 3-3A is an anti-A that recognizes all types of A determinants: types 1, 2, 3, 4, and difucosylated types 1 and 2.28 mAb MBr1, a kind gift from Dr. M. Colnaghi (Milan, Italy), is an anti-H types 3 and 4\u2013specific antibody. The anti-NV capsid rabbit polyclonal antiserum was obtained by immunizing a rabbit with rNV VLPs as previously described.17 mAb 9C3 was 1 of 12 mAbs isolated from mice immunized with 4 strains of NLVs including NV, MxV, HV, and GrV. This mAb reacts only with NV, based on enzyme immunoassays and blocking enzyme immunoassays. It recognizes nondenaturated epitopes on recombinant NV capsid antigens based on Western blot analysis.20 The agglutinin I from Ulex europeus (UEA-I) lectin, which recognizes H type 2 and Lewis Y oligosaccharides, either free, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), or peroxidase conjugated, was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Recombinant NV VLPs were produced by using a baculovirus-expression system and purified by rate-zonal centrifugation in a sucrose gradient as previously described.17\n",

These human samples were obtained before the law 88-1138 (December 20, 1988) concerning resection of human tissues after death for scientific investigations. Phenotypes of the tissue donors were: ALe(a+b\u2212) 1 individual, BLe(a+b\u2212) 1 individual, OLe(a+b\u2212) 3 individuals, ALe(a\u2212b\u2212) 2 individuals, OLe(a\u2212b\u2212) 1 individual, ALe(a\u2212b+) 2 individuals, BLe(a\u2212b+) 1 individual, ABLe(a\u2212b+) 1 individual, OLe(a\u2212b+) 1 individual. The 3 Le(a\u2212b\u2212) donors were secretors of H in the gastroduodenal junction. Tissue samples were fixed in 95% ethanol for 48 hours, coiled into Swiss rolls, and paraffin embedded. Sections (5 \u03bcm) were rehydrated in graded ethanol and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Endogenous peroxidase was inhibited by using methanol/H2O2 0.3% for 20 minutes. Sections were then washed in PBS for 5 minutes and covered with PBS/bovine serum albumin (BSA) 1% for 20 minutes at room temperature in a humid atmosphere. After washing in PBS, sections were covered with either the primary antibodies or rNV VLPs diluted in PBS/BSA 1% and left at 4\u00b0C overnight. Antibodies were used at 1 \u03bcg/mL and VLPs at 5 \u03bcg/mL. Sections were then rinsed 3 times with PBS and incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig)G (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) or rabbit anti-rNV VLPs diluted 1/1000, respectively, for 60 minutes at room temperature. After washing in PBS, the sections were covered with either peroxidase-conjugated avidin (Vector Labs) or with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) for 45 minutes, washed with PBS, and reactions were revealed with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazol. Counterstaining was performed with Mayer's hemalun. Periodate treatment was performed immediately after the endogenous peroxidase quenching step by incubating sections with 10 mmol/L sodium periodate in 50 mmol/L, pH 5.0, sodium acetate buffer for 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by a 10-minute incubation with 1% glycine. Fucosidase treatment was performed on some sections by incubation at 37\u00b0C with 4 mU fucosidase II in 50 mmol/L, pH 5.0, sodium phosphate buffer for a total of 18 hours with a renewal after 6 hours. Controls were performed by using fucosidase, heat-inactivated by prior boiling in a water bath for 10 minutes. Inhibition of rNV VLPs attachment with synthetic oligosaccharides was performed by preincubating the VLPs with the oligosaccharides at a final concentration of 1.8 mmol/L in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Thereafter, the VLPs/oligosaccharide mixtures were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on tissue-coded sections as described earlier. To assay the ability of anticarbohydrate mAbs to compete with rNV VLPs attachment, coded tissue sections were first incubated with mAbs at 10 \u03bcg/mL for 1 hour at room temperature. rNV VLPs were then added and incubated as described earlier. Their binding was detected by using a rabbit anti-rNV VLPs antiserum at 1/1000 in 1% BSA/PBS, followed after washings by peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). Intensity of staining was semiquantitatively estimated by 3 persons; 2 of them did not know the code of sections.",

In contrast, H type 2 epitopes were readily detected both on the surface epithelia and the glands from secretors as well as on the glands from nonsecretors (Figure 1F). The expression of A and H types 3 and 4 epitopes in the normal gut has previously been reported.31, 32 They could not be detected at the cell surface, but were evidenced at the Golgi level. This was confirmed in the present study (data not shown). Thus, the binding of rNV VLPs to the gastroduodenal junction correlates with the presence of the H type 1 antigen and not with that of H type 2 or H types 3 and 4 antigens.",

In agreement with the histochemistry experiments, strong binding occurred on saliva from 4 of 4 secretors but not from 4 of 4 nonsecretors (Figure 3A).In addition, this binding was clearly inhibited by the H type 1 and H type 3 trisaccharides, whereas the closely related H type 2, type 1 precursor, or Lewis a oligosaccharides showed little or no inhibition (Figure 3B). These inhibitions required concentrations of free oligosaccharides about 4 orders of magnitude higher than the concentration of capsid protein.

FTB is the rat homologue of human FUT2 and we recently showed that, like its human counterpart, it catalyzes the transfer of a fucose on either precursor, yet with a clear preference for types 1, 3, and 4 over type 2.34 Neither parental CHO cells nor TS/A cells have detectable \u03b11,2fucosyltransferase activity and, consequently, they are devoid of A, B, or H histo-blood group antigens. However, after transfection with the FTB cDNA, both cell lines express H types 2 and 3 and 4 determinants, but not H type 1 (Figure 4).The lack of H type 1 epitopes on these transfectants is likely caused by an absence of type 1 precursor, as in the case of CHO cells.35 When assayed by flow cytometry, binding of rNV VLPs to these H antigen\u2013expressing CHO and TS/A transfectants was readily detected. In contrast, no binding was evidenced on mock transfected cells (Figure 4). Addition of either an N-acetylgalactosamine or a galactose residue onto H structures generates A or B antigens, respectively, and this is known to hinder recognition by anti-H reagents.36 To get further insight into the specificity of NV capsids, both CHO and TS/A cells were doubly transfected with the FTB and rat A enzyme cDNAs. As expected, the double transfectants expressed the A antigen whereas their recognition by either the anti-H type 2 or the anti-H types 3 and 4 mAbs was severely diminished. The binding of rNV VLPs to these double transfectants also dropped, indicating that the presence of the A histo-blood group N-acetylgalactosamine hinders recognition of the subjacent H antigens by these viral capsids. In addition, this weak attachment of rNV VLPs to A-positive CHO and TS/A cells confirms specificity of the binding to strongly H-positive cells.",

The alkaline phosphatase activity of Caco-2 cells was 4.8 nmol \u00b7 min\u22121 \u00b7 mg\u22121 at day 1 after confluency and progressively increased to reach 99.6 nmol \u00b7 min\u22121 \u00b7 mg\u22121 at day 15, indicating that the spontaneous differentiation process had taken place at day 15. Undifferentiated Caco-2 cells expressed H type 2 and moderate levels of H types 3 and 4 epitopes, but no detectable H type 1. At variance, differentiated Caco-2 cells strongly expressed all types of H epitopes. In agreement with previous reports, attachment of rNV VLPs was detectable at the surface of differentiated Caco-2 cells (Figure 5), but not of undifferentiated Caco-2 cells (data not shown). The small amount of H types 3 and 4 detectable on undifferentiated Caco-2 cells is probably not sufficient to allow detectable attachment of rNV VLPs. A similar phenomenon was previously observed with RHDV.25 RHDV virions or recombinant particles bind to H type 2 present on adult rabbit epithelial cells. However, attachment could not be detected on young rabbit cells, which express much lower levels of H type 2 than adult cells. It is likely that VLPs require a minimal density of ligands to bind to cell surfaces. Thus, attachment of rNV VLPs to Caco-2 cells correlates with the presence of H type 1 or large amounts of H types 3 and 4 epitopes but not with that of H type 2. After 2 hours at 37\u00b0C, most of these VLPs were localized inside the cells, indicating that they have been internalized (Figure 5). The binding to differentiated Caco-2 cells was completely inhibited by preincubation with a saliva from a secretor individual but not from a nonsecretor individual (Figure 5D and E) and partly inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with fucosidase II (Figure 5F).",

Alternatively, the carbohydrates could function as decoy receptors, in which case their recognition would impair entry of the virus particles into cells and lead to their elimination. To test these 2 hypotheses, we examined the internalization of rNV VLPs into Caco-2 and the transfected CHO and TS/A cells. Differentiated Caco-2 cells are the only intestinal cells known to express H type 1 in culture.26 As previously described by others26 and confirmed during the present work (data not shown), this carbohydrate structure is hardly detectable on undifferentiated Caco-2 cells and appears progressively during the course of differentiation. The results obtained with differentiated Caco-2 cells indicate that the interaction requires recognition of H types 1 and/or 3 by the rNV VLPs. After attachment, these particles are internalized. This is confirmed by the internalization that occurs after binding to FTB-transfected, but not -nontransfected, CHO cells. It is suggested that the expression of the carbohydrate ligand on the cell surface is required for internalization of the virus particles. This process is not species specific because CHO cells are derived from a Chinese hamster ovary carcinoma. Although these results tend to indicate that the fucosylated carbohydrate is not a decoy receptor, they do not conclude that it can be a functional receptor because cultivation of the virus has not been obtained as yet.",

The differentiation state of the cells could be an important factor. Our cells were cultivated on Transwell chambers rather than on plastic culture wells. In addition, they were kept in culture for a longer period of time after confluency with frequent changes of medium. These different culture conditions could affect the differentiation of the cells. The confocal microscopy experiments that we performed were not quantitative and therefore do not allow us to draw conclusions as to the proportion of bound particles that were internalized. Observations were concentrated on areas where the cells presented a well-differentiated morphology. In these fields, after 2 hours at 37\u00b0C, most detectable VLPs were localized intracellularly and few cells with surface-bound VLPs remained visible. Observation of cells that were not clearly morphologically differentiated showed a weaker binding of VLPs and no clear internalization. Thus, partly differentiated Caco-2 cells may present sufficient levels of H epitopes to allow some attachment of NV particles but not to allow internalization. They may also lack additional molecules required for internalization that would only be expressed on fully differentiated cells.",

Yet, if this was the case, the fact that NV particles attach only to the gut of secretor individuals suggests that only these people can be infected by the virus. In contrast, nonsecretor individuals are not expected to be infected because they lack the histo-blood group H oligosaccharides on the digestive epithelial cells. Most interestingly, it has been observed in studies performed on volunteers challenged with NV that nearly 20% of the subjects did not develop clinical signs of the disease or antibodies to the virus.43 This frequency matches that of the nonsecretors in the general European or North American populations, suggesting that the polymorphism at the FUT2 locus could indeed be a major genetic determinant for sensitivity to NV. Among the remaining 80% volunteers, a significant proportion developed antibodies but no clinical signs, indicating that additional factors may be responsible for resistance to the infection. Our observation that the presence of the A histo-blood group antigenic motif hinders the binding site of rNV VLPs suggests that the polymorphisms at the ABO locus could also play a part in determining sensitivity to the virus. The availability of H epitopes at the digestive epithelial cell surface may depend on the interactions between the enzymes encoded by the ABO, Lewis (FUT3), and secretor (FUT2) genes. Our histochemical study did not reveal significant differences of rNV VLPs binding to digestive tissue from individuals of different ABO or Lewis types. However, this approach is not quantitative and does not allow us to rule out the possibility that A or B blood group individuals present less binding sites to the virus than do O individuals. Epidemiologic or volunteer studies are thus warranted to define the contribution of the ABO, FUT2, and FUT3 genes to the sensitivity to NV.",

            "text": "NV is the prototype of the NLV group that presents a large diversity. It is not yet known if other strains of NLVs can also bind to H-type oligosaccharides. Viruses belonging to very distant families can use the same receptors, whereas highly homologous strains within the same family may use distinct receptors.44 The ability to bind histo-blood group H structures is shared between the animal (RHDV) and human (NV) CVs despite little homology between the P2 subdomains of their capsid proteins. It is possible that this property is also shared among many HuCV strains, yet this remains to be shown. If this was the case, it would be useful to design oligosaccharide mimics able to compete with the virus at the time of infection. Such molecules could be of major interest in preventing outbreaks. Finally, artificial virus vectors prepared by packaging DNA into recombinant VLPs proved efficient for gene transfer in in vitro experiments.45 The exquisite property of NV capsids to recognize cells that express H types 1 or 3 antigens could thus be exploited in the context of gene therapy to specific target cells.",
