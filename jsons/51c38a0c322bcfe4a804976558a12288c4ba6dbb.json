To confront the epidemic, a simple SIR model is used to simulate the number of affected patients of Coronavirus disease in Romania and Pakistan. The model captures the growth in case onsets and the estimated results are almost compatible with the actual reported cases. Through the calibration of parameters, forecast for the appearance of new cases in Romania and Pakistan is reported till the end of this year by analysing the current situation. The constant level of number of patients and time-to-reach this level is also reported through the simulations. The drastic condition is also discussed which may occur if all the preventive restraints are removed.",

            "text": "The coronavirus 2019-20 (COVID- 19) pandemic was affirmed to have arrived in Romania on 26 th February of this year [16] . Due to the spread of coronary disease in Italy, the government of Romania reported two weeks of isolation, starting from 21 st February, for its residents which were coming back from the influenced regions [17] . On the very next day, the Romanian government declared a few preventive measures, including assignment of five clinics as separation-habitats for new cases, arrangement of warm scanners on airport terminals, and uniquely assigned lines for travelers originating from zones influenced by COVID-19 outbreak [18] . For avoiding the virus expansion several steps were taken by the government like on 9 th March the authorities reported discontinuance of trips to and from Italy via all terminals [19] also the Special National Emergency Situations Committee ordered to close all schools on the same day. Two days later, on 11 th March, the Government distributed a rundown of the fifteen rules in regards to the mindful social conduct in forestalling the spread of COVID- 19 [20] . Specialists have forced a prohibition on all religious, scientific, sports, social or diversion occasions with more than 100 members for the next three weeks. The number of affected people crossed the first hundred at the end of the second week of March. The first three deaths were announced in Romania on 22 nd March. All three deceased were already suffering from different diseases such as diabetes, dialysis, and lung cancer, etc. [21] . Following a flood of new affirmed cases, on March 24, the administration declared Military Ordinance, establishing a national lock-down and bringing in the military to help police and the Gendarmerie in authorizing the new limitations. Developments outside the homes was strictly prohibited, with certain exemptions (work, purchasing nourishment or medication, and so forth.). Old people over 65 years were permitted to leave their homes just between 11 a.m.-1 p.m. [22] . Two days after this, on March 26, the National airline also suspended all local flights [23] . Total population of the Romania is about 19, 237, 691 [24] . The average life expectancy for people of Romania is 76 years [25] . One can see from the model (1) that we are involving disease-related death and immunity, so we have to fit our model with active real cases, active means no disease-related death, and no recovery. So, initially, we have 3 active cases on March 5, 2020. Hence, our initial conditions are I(0) = 3 and R(0) = 3 and rest are the susceptible. We have simulated our model and fit with the real cases. Figure ( 2) portrays the fitting of our model (1) with the real data given in figure (1) . By observing the figure (2), one can compare the actual data reported by [26] and the data collected by the simple SIR model (1) given in section 2. We can see number of active cases are almost matching with the actual ones. We also estimate number of COVID-19 patients that will appear in next duration. It can be observed, from figure (2) , that infection is continuously spreading un till August, 2020. After this period the malady is going to stable under the current situation. Note that here we have taken the average rate and disease related death rate per day up to April 30,2020. According to our estimate, there is no chance of vanishing the disease from community if the average daily and unfortunately disease related death rate is going on with the same rate. From figure (2), we can see that the number of patients will be \u223c 10091 by the 31 st May, on June 28 th patients will be \u223c 11127 and by the end of this year number will reach at \u223c 12000. Week wise expected number of patients for the next months of this year is shown in Table 1 .

The maximum average recovery rate happened between (1 \u2212 7) March and it is 5.71%. During the week (29 March-4 April), minimum average recovery rate has been observed and its value is 3.5%. Similarly average disease related death rate varies every week. Its minimum value occurred between (12 April-18 April) which is 0.32%. The maximum average number of deaths per day appeared during the week (29 March-4 April) and its value is 0.7%. We vary the values of recovery and disease related death rates by observing this pattern and estimate the number of patients that will appear in the later weeks of this year. Similarly we increase and decrease the values of transmission rate and inhibition effect up to 25% and 50% and also estimate the number of COVID-19 cases. The effect of the transmission rate (\u03b2), the death rate due to COVID-19 (\u03b4), recovery rate (\u03b1) and the inhibition or precautionary measures (\u03bd) on the number of COVID-19 patients have been calculated and shown in Figure 3 .",

We can see from Figure 3a that the number of patients accelerates as \u03b2 increases. The model fitted value for \u03b2 is 0.396 and for that value, the number of patients by the end of this year will be \u223c 12000.

By comparing model outcomes with the confirmed cases, it has been observed that our estimated values have good correspondence with the confirmed numbers. If the current pattern is going on then, according to our estimate, there will be \u223c 12000 infectious individuals in Romania by the end of this year. Pakistan will bear the burden of \u223c 55800 till the end of December, 2020. The situation will vary by the variation of transmission rate, death rate, recovery rate, and further implementation of social distancing in both countries. It has been observed that average weekly recovery rate and average weekly disease related death vary for both countries. If the transmission rate in Romania increases 50% and recovery rate and disease related death rate is taken for 30 th April, according to reported data, then there will be \u223c 9000 persons carrying Corona malady and if this rate decreases 50%, then 2364 infected persons will exist in the Romanian community by the end of this year. If we take previous average maximum weekly recovery rate and disease related death rate, then there will be \u223c 5613 and \u223c 5301, patients, respectively in Romania. Similarly, by assuming minimum weekly average recovery and disease related death rate will result \u223c 23812 and \u223c 5724, respectively. The inhibition effect or precautionary measures also influence in the spreading of pandemic. If the inhibition factor increases upto 50%, then \u223c 4951 patients will be existing in Romania till the end of this year. This number will exceed to \u223c 11395, if precautionary measures decreases to 50%. The worst effects of the disease appear in the community, if we remove all the barriers. In such case, this malady may increase by effecting \u223c 55% population till the end of this month. This number will start to decrease after May. Increase or decrease in transmission rate will also results in decrease or increase in the number 23 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Although these estimates may vary with the passage of time but it will really help us to observe the most influential factors that causes to increase the epidemic.
