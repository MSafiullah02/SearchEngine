            "text": "Dengue fever (DF) is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by the viruses of the genus Togaviridae subgenus Flavirus. The disease has first appeared in the Phillipines in 1953, and from then on it has become the most important anthropod-borne viral disease due to its spread among humans (Monath 1994). The reemergence of this disease worldwide is causing larger, more frequent epidemics especially in cities and in the tropics. Dengue virus infection has been reported in more than 100 countries, with 2.5 billion people living in areas where dengue is endemic (CDC 2000; Guzman and Kouri 2002; PAHO 2007) (see Fig. 1.1). Dengue is one of the major international public health concerns of World Health Organization (WHO) because of the growing geographic distribution of virus and mosquito vectors, \u00adco-circulation of multiple virus serotypes and higher frequency of the epidemics.\n",

A person who recovers from the infection due to one of the virus serotypes would have life long immunity against that serotype but he is susceptible to subsequent infection by the other three \u00adserotypes. There is strong evidence (De Paula and Fonseca 2004; Gubler 1998; Halstead 2007; Harris et al. 2000; Monath 1994; Nimmannitya 1997; Ooi et al. 2007; Wilder-Smith and Schwartz 2005) that subsequent infections would increase the risk of more acute forms of the disease known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) which could be fatal and may even lead to death. The annual occurrence is estimated to be around 100 million cases of DF and 250,000 cases of DHF. The mortality rate is around 25,000 per year (Gibbons 2002). The mortality rate is most common in children. The main pathophysiology of DHF and DSS is the development of plasma leakage from the capillaries, resulting in hemoconcentration, ascites, and pleural effusion that may lead to shock (Halstead 1998).",

Definitive laboratory diagnosis requires isolation of the virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, immunofluorescence, or immunohistochemistry (De Paula and Fonseca 2004; Halstead 1998; Vaughn et al. 2000). Further, the places where dengue is endemic may not have the necessary infrastructure to carry out these tests (Ooi et al. 2007).

In most of the studies the incidence rates and age structure play a vital role in understanding the transmission of the virus. The rate of spread of an infectious disease which is an important aspect for disease management is estimated using a neural network technology (Sree Hari Rao and Naresh Kumar 2010). Statistical analysis based on the \u03c7\n2 tests for discrete attributes, logistic regression and Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous attributes are applied on the clinical data sets for classifying issues related to the diagnosis (Chadwick et al. 2006; Kalayanarooj et al. 1997; Ramos et al. 2009). Decision tree-based algorithms such as C4.5 have been used to differentiate dengue from non-dengue illness and predict the outcome of the disease. We have examined these issues critically and have established that our methodology yields more positive predictions when compared with those obtained by using C4.5 decision tree approach (Tanner et al. 2008).",

The authors have developed a new alternating decision tree (RNIADT for short) (Sree Hari Rao and Naresh Kumar 2011c) methodology which generates more accurate decisions rules as compared to the C4.5 decision tree (Tanner et al. 2008) and logistic regression (Chadwick et al. 2006; Ramos et al. 2009) for identifying the early clinical features that predict the diagnosis of dengue. Tanner et al. (2008) have applied C4.5 decision tree algorithm on acute febrile illness affected individuals using simple clinical and hematological parameters. Further, this study also requires laboratory features such as platelet count, crossover threshold value of a real-time PCR (RT-PCR) for dengue viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) and the presence of preexisting anti-dengue immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. It is known that administration of these laboratory tests require 2\u201312 days (Sa-Ngasang et al. 2006; Vaughn et al. 1997) and in some cases the condition of the patient may not allow such a long wait. However, the research in Tanner et al. (2008) provides more insight into the scientific understanding of the disease prevalence among the infected individuals. From the effective clinical management point of view, it is desirable to have a methodology that helps one to identify the suspected dengue individuals from simple clinical features. This helps to reduce the spread of the disease in the community.",

However, when the virus is carried into the cell and into lysozomes, an acidic environment causes the protein to snap into a different shape, assembling into trimeric spike. Several hydrophobic amino acids at the tip of this spike inserts into the lysozomal membrane and causes the virus membrane to fuse with lysozome.

The resulting polyprotein is subsequently cleaved by cellular and viral proteases at specific recognition sites. The viral nonstructural proteins use a negative-sense intermediate to replicate the positive-sense RNA genome, which then associates with the capsid protein and is packaged into individual virions. Replication of all positive-stranded RNA viruses occurs in close association with virus-induced intracellular membrane structures. DENV also induces such extensive rearrangements of intracellular membranes, called replication complex (RC). These RCs seem to contain viral proteins, viral RNA, and host cell factors. The subsequently formed immature virions are assembled by budding of newly formed nucleocapsids into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thereby acquiring a lipid bilayer envelope with the structural proteins prM and E. The virions mature during transport through the acidic trans-golgi network, where the prM proteins stabilize the E proteins to prevent conformational changes. Before release of the virions from the host cell, the maturation process is completed when prM is cleaved into a soluble pr peptides and virion-associated M by the cellular protease furin. Outside the cell, the virus particles encounter a neutral pH, which promotes dissociation of the pr peptides from the virus particles and generates mature, infectious virions. At this point the cycle repeats itself (Net DV, (2011).",

However, this is not always true, since missing values can appear in the form of outliers or even wrong data (i.e., out of boundaries) (Pearson 2005). Especially in medical databases, most data are collected as a by-product of patient care activities rather than from an organized research point of view (Cios and Mooree 2002). There are three main strategies for handling missing data situations. The first consists in eliminating incomplete observations, which has major limitations namely loss of substantial information, if many of the attributes have missing values in the data records (Kim and Curry 1977) and this renders introduction of biases in the data (Little and Rubin 1987). The second strategy is to treat the missing values during the data mining process of knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) as envisaged in C4.5. The third method of handling missing values is through imputation, replacing each instance of the missing value with a probable or predicted value (Dixon 1979), which is most suitable for KDD applications, since the completed data can be used for any data mining activity.",

Single imputation strategies involve using the mean, median, or mode (Schafer 1997) or regression-based methods (Horton and Lipsitz 2001) to impute the missing values. Traditional approaches of handling missing values like complete case analysis, overall mean imputation and missing-indicator method (Heijden et al. 2006) can lead to biased estimates and may either reduce or exaggerate the statistical power. Each of these distortions can lead to invalid conclusions. Statistical methods of handling missing values consist of using maximum likelihood and expectation maximization algorithms (Allison 2002; Roderick and Donald 2002; Schafer 1997). Some of these methods would work only for certain types of attributes either nominal or numeric. Machine learning approaches like neural networks with genetic algorithms (Mussa and Tshilidzi 2006), neural networks with particle swarm optimization (Qiao et al. 2005) have been used to approximate the missing values. The use of neural networks comes with a greater cost in terms of computation and training. Methods like radial basis function networks, support vector machines, and principal component analysis have been utilized for estimating the missing values.",

The specificity, sensitivity, predictive value of both positives and negatives are computed using standard formulae to identify the clinical attributes that can distinguish dengue from other illnesses in children and adults. In addition to the above metrics a better measure known as area under the curve (AUC) score is being used in place of accuracies and error rate as it can represent the overall performance of a classifier (Huang and Ling 2005) in a robust manner. Based on the values (see Table 1.5) of the AUC one can categorize the performance of the classifier. The clinical attributes are selected either separately or in combination so as to have at least 70% positive and negative predictive values (Ramos et al. 2009).

Wrapper subset evaluation models (Ron and George 1997) use the method of classification itself to measure the importance of the feature set. Wrapper methods generally result in better performance in terms of classification accuracies than filter methods because the features selected are optimized for the classification algorithm to be used. The wrapper approach (Kohavi and John 1998) defines a subset of solutions to a chosen data set and a particular induction algorithm, taking into account the inductive biases of the algorithm and its interaction with the training data set. The influential attribute selection procedure using wrapper subset evaluation is shown in Fig. 1.6. The point of concern with the wrapper method is its computational complexity as each feature set considered must be evaluated with the classification algorithm used (Dash and Liu 1997; Saeys et al. 2007).\n",

Each time, one of the k subsets is used as the test set and the other k  \u2212  1 subsets are put together to form a training set. Then the average error across all k trials is computed. To compare and evaluate the decision trees popular performance measures such as sensitivity, specificity, receiver operator characteristics (ROC), and area under ROC (AUC) (Crichton 2002; Metz 1978) have been employed. The definitions of the above measures are discussed briefly for the benefit of the readers. The classification task generates a set of rules which can be used for classifying individuals to different classes/groups. This may result in the following situations:\nFalse positive (FP): the rules may predict the diagnosis of the patient as positive (presence of the disease) whereas the actual diagnosis is negative (absence of the disease).False negative (FN): the rules may predict the diagnosis of the patient as negative (absence of the disease) whereas the actual diagnosis is positive (presence of the disease).True positive (TP): when the prediction of the classifier matches with the actual diagnosis as positive.True negative (TN): when the prediction of the classifier matches with the actual diagnosis as negative.\n",

(2008) have suggested a WBC  \u2264  6.0  \u00d7  1,000 cells with an odds ratio of 8.7 and body temperature  >  37.4\u00b0C mm3 having an odds ratio of 7.2 playing a role in splitting the decision tree. Sree Hari Rao and Naresh Kumar (2011b) have identified WBC, Hb, rashes, and fever (body temperature) as the key attributes influencing the diagnosis of dengue. The predictive value of WBC  \u2265  8.2  \u00d7  1,000 cells was found to be 1.3, pulse  \u2265  81 has a predictive value of 0.91 mm3 and fever duration \u22655.5 has a predictive value of 2.03. The comparisons of the results are presented in Tables 1.17 and 1.18. From these observations the authors have felt that the methodologies in Sree Hari Rao and Naresh Kumar (2011a, b, d) when applied on the data set (Chadwick et al. 2006; Ramos et al. 2009; Tanner et al. 2008) would yield more accurate results.\n\n",

            "text": "In this chapter, we have presented several methodologies that help in the effective diagnosis of the dengue illness. A first level effort leads to the question of identifying the suspected individuals in the community, which will have the major advantage of reducing transmission risk of the disease. Laboratory investigations for the confirmation of the illness on the suspected individuals will certainly help in disease management and control by providing supportive care. A new alternate decision theoretic method designated as RNIADT (which is not followed in conventional clinical treatment procedures) developed in recent times is the subject of main discussion in this chapter. This methodology has been found extremely useful in identifying the most influential clinical and laboratory characteristics of dengue illness. Further, this analysis helps one to conclude that the WHO definitions for dengue fever hold good. To substantiate, a study has been performed on a data set consisting of 1,044 individuals both children and adults where in the original definitions of WHO are still valid. Though the methodology discussed in this chapter may be taken as a universal tool for the effective diagnosis of this disease it remains to see whether or not this methodology is geographically dependant. Though we are certain that the RNIADT methodology is universal, we could not establish the same due to lack of clinical and laboratory data pertaining to different parts of the globe. However, we are willing to share our predictive methodologies and strategies with the researchers working on dengue illness all over the globe. We hold the view that more intensive and introspective studies of this kind will pave the way for better clinical management and virological surveillance of this illness.",
