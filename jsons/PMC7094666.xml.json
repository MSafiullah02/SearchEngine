            "text": "The considerable interest to the heterocyclic compounds containing N-oxide group is caused by their pronounced biological activity [1]. Among the representatives of this class, there are compounds with bactericidal, analgesic, anticonvulsant activity, as well as ones with apoptotic, antifungal and antimicrobial activity [2], [3]. These properties allow to use N-oxides as inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase [4], [5], as antiviral agent against various SARS coronavirus strains [6], and as antiadhesive and quorum-sensitive inhibitor [7]. In the literature one can find the evidence, that some complexes with pyridine-N-oxides are used in agriculture to regulate plant growth rates [8]. It was shown that pyridine-N-oxide derivatives are genotoxic [9]. The biochemical activity of N-oxides is usually considered to be the result of complexation with the metalloporphyrins in living organisms [10], [11], [12]. The reactivity of N-oxides may vary due to different substituents in the ring [13]. The variation of the substituents gives wide possibilities to chemical modifications of N-oxides and allows to influence their complexing properties, and, as the result, their biological activity. To understand the complexation ability of N-oxides with different substituents the detailed information about the properties of free molecules is needed.",

            "text": "The available literature data about molecular structure of N-oxides can not be considered comprehensive. Thus, only pyridine-N-oxide and three of its para-substituted compounds have been studied by gas-electron diffraction (GED) [14], [15]. Analyzing the average values of bond lengths in the pyridine ring the authors of [15] have concluded that the aromaticity increases in the series: 4-nitropyridine-N-oxide (4-NO2PyO), 4-chloropyridine-N-oxide (4-ClPyO), pyridine-N-oxide (PyO), 4-methylpyridine-N-oxide(4-MePyO). The crystal structures of PyO, 4-NO2PyO and 4-MePyO have been studied by X-ray crystallography [16], [17]. The quantum chemical study of the substituent effect on the properties of pyridine-N-oxides has been performed for ten compounds with different substituents [18]. The comparative analysis of structural data obtained by different methods suggests that the molecular parameters of N-oxides obtained by GED [15] look rather strange. Thus, the N\u2014C bond lengths in 4-NO2PyO, 4-MePyO, 4-ClPyO recommended in Ref. [15] are even longer than r(C\u2014C) in benzene ring, and seems to be overestimated compare to the calculated values and X-ray data. Moreover, the bond distance r(N\u2192O) in 4-MePyO molecule recommended by authors [15] appears to be significantly overestimated and conflicting with the calculated and X-ray values. Furthermore, the accuracy of GED data obtained in Refs. [14], [15] cannot be considered today as satisfactory.",

Polycrystalline ZnO was used to establish the wavelength of the fast electrons. Microphotometric measurements were carried out by means of automatic techniques [32]. The molecular intensities were obtained in the ranges 2.5\u00f728.7 \u00c5\u22121 (short camera) and 1.3\u00f715.5 \u00c5\u22121 (long camera).

The methyl group was considered in the framework of C\n3v symmetry. Vibrational amplitudes were refined in groups with fixed differences. With the abovementioned assumptions, four bond distances and four bond angles (Table 3) were refined simultaneously with six groups of vibrational amplitudes. Vibrational amplitudes were refined in groups with fixed differences (Table 4). Only two correlation coefficients had absolute values larger than 0.7: (r(N\u2014C3))/(r(C2\u2014C3)) = \u22120.74, and (\u2220NC3C2)/(\u2220C3NC4) = - 0.84. The best agreement factor is Rf = 3.4%.

Table 5 compares gas-phase structures of PyO and 4-Me-PyO obtained in Refs. [14], [15] and in this work. The parameters obtained in our research is in a good agreement with the theoretical results (therein and [18]) and, also, with the parameters for non-substituted N-oxide in contrast to the values recommended by Chiang J. F. et al. [15]. Furthermore, the parameters of free molecules of PyO [14] and 4-Me-PyO obtained in this work are in a good agreement with the crystal structures [34], [35]. Apparently, some increase of the semipolar N\u2192O bond lengths in the crystal phase compared to free molecules is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding. All parameters presented in Table 5 confirm the hyperconjugation in the pyridine ring and the sp2 hybridization concept of the nitrogen and carbon atoms in the ring.

It is interesting to note, that the substituent effects on the geometry of heterocyclic ring are rather similar to the tendencies for the benzene ring [36], [37]. Thus, the presence of the electron-donating CH3 substituent leads to the decrease of the ipso-angle. Furthermore, according to the calculations the r(N\u2192O) bond lengths appear to be also sensitive to a substituent nature. Thus, the presence of the electron donating methyl group results in an increase of r(N\u2192O).",

This confirms the existence of \u03c0-conjugation in the pyridine rings. The C1\u2014C6 bond order for 4-MePyO corresponds to the single C\u2014C bond. It is interesting to note that Q(N\u2014O) in both molecules can not be interpreted as exact single or double bond. Moreover, the introduction of an electron-donating substituent increases the bond length N\u2192O, slightly reduces the corresponding bond order and significantly increases the electron density on the oxygen. One can conclude that in this case the nucleophilic properties of the molecule increase. Furthermore, as it has been mentioned previously [18] the introduction of electron-donating substituents to the heterocyclic ring of N-oxides results in increasing ability for complex formation. Our experimental and calculated data (Table 3, Table 6, Table 7) reveal the incorrectness of the authors of [15] in their conclusion about more single N\u2014O bond character in 4-MePyO.",

The energy of these interactions can be estimated by the second order perturbation theory. Table 7 collects the largest values of calculated second order interaction energies (E\n2) between donor-acceptor orbitals in PyO and 4-MePyO. In both cases several values correspond to the interactions related to the resonance in the pyridine ring, i.e. the interactions between \u03c0(C\u2014C) and \u03c0*(C\u2014C) and between \u03c0(C\u2014C) and \u03c0*(C\u2014N). The nature of semipolar N\u2014O bond was explained in detail [18]. The largest second order interaction energies (E\n2) in both molecules correspond to the LP3(O) interaction with the antibonding \u03c0*(N\u2014C) NBO (Fig. 4\n.). Such interaction can lead to partial transfer of electron density from LP3(O) to the \u03c0-system of the pyridine ring. As the result, the occupancy of the LP3(O) p\u03c0-orbital of oxygen is only 1.62e or 1.65e in PyO and 4-MePyO, respectively.",

NICS(1) values correspond to the negative isotropic shielding (in ppm) at 1 \u00c5 above the ring plane. The calculated values of NICS(1): \u22127.40 (PyO) and \u22127.36 (4-Me-PyO) are very close to each other. Thus, from the NICS(1) values one can conclude that the introduction of CH3 group does not noticeably affect the aromaticity of the pyridine-N-oxide. Furthermore, the data of Table 5 do not confirm the conclusion of the authors of [15] about changing the aromaticity with substitution, which was made by analyzing the average values of bond length in the pyridine ring.",
