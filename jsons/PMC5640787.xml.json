Many viruses induce subcellular microenvironments or mini\u2010organelles known as \u2018virus factories\u2019 or viroplasm (Fernandez de Castro et al., 2013). These viral factories are thought to create a platform bringing together the replicase proteins, virus genomes and host proteins required for replication, while physically separating replication sites from the cytoplasmic sensors of the innate immune response. A common feature of plus\u2010strand RNA viruses is the ability to usurp and modify host\u2010cell cytoplasmic membranes to form functional site for protein translation, processing and RNA synthesis (den Boon and Ahlquist, 2010; den Boon et al., 2010). Depending of the family and genus to which the virus belongs, these rearranged cellular membranes may be derived from various organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), late endosomes/lysosomes or the mitochondrial outer membrane. Plus\u2010strand RNA viruses induce the formation of two types of vesicles: (i) single\u2010membrane vesicles, formed by negatively curved membranes and initiated by invaginations of the pre\u2010existing membrane bilayer, giving rise to spherules or vacuoles toward the lumen of the targeted cell organelle, and (ii) double\u2010membrane vesicles (DMVs), formed by positively curved membranes.",

These membrane rearrangements include not only convoluted membranes and single\u2010membrane vesicles, but also a massive network of DMVs. The various host\u2010cell membrane rearrangements induced by the different families of positive\u2010strand RNA viruses have recently been reviewed in detail (den Boon and Ahlquist, 2010; Chatel\u2010Chaix and Bartenschlager, 2014; Romero\u2010Brey and Bartenschlager, 2014).

Poliovirus replicase proteins and nascent viral RNA localize at the outer membrane of these single\u2010 and double\u2010membrane structures (Belov et al., 2012). It has been suggested that these DMVs are formed by the extension of membranous walls and/or collapse of the luminal cavity of the single\u2010membrane tubular structures, which probably originate from cis\u2010Golgi membranes. A similar process has been observed for coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), another member of the Picornaviridae family, with closed single\u2010membrane tubules present from the start of infection gradually being converted into DMVs (approximately 160 nm in diameter), and then into complex multimembranous structures, through a wrapping process (Limpens et al., 2011). However, the precise location of viral proteins and RNA with respect to these rearranged membranes remains to be determined in this viral model.",

Similar observations have also been reported for the recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, for which convoluted membranes are systematically surrounded by DMVs and are observed only in cells at more advanced stages of infection (de Wilde et al., 2013). This observation is consistent with the notion that DMV formation precedes the development of convoluted membranes, as previously suggested for SARS\u2010CoV. These coronavirus\u2010induced DMVs may subsequently merge into larger structures called vesicle packets (1\u20135 \u03bcm in size), probably through the fusion of their outer membranes (Knoops et al., 2008). Coronavirus replicase proteins are mostly found in convoluted membranes, and are rarely detected in DMVs. By contrast, double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA), an intermediate of viral replication that serves as a marker for this process, is predominantly found in DMVs (Knoops et al., 2008). Despite the absence of specific morphological structures, such as convoluted membranes and vesicle packets, a similar architecture is observed in cells infected with the equine arterivirus (EAV), a member of the Arteriviridae family, with small DMVs (about 90 nm in diameter) interconnected to form a reticulovesicular network in the close vicinity of single\u2010membrane tubular structures (Knoops et al., 2012). As for coronaviruses, EAV replicase proteins are associated with DMVs and the surrounding membranes, whereas dsRNA is mostly located in DMVs.",

By contrast, another member of this family, the hepatitis C virus (HCV), induces the production of large number of DMVs (Ferraris et al., 2010; Romero\u2010Brey et al., 2012). Thus, despite being unrelated to picornaviruses, coronaviruses and arteriviruses, HCV may display similarities to these other groups of viruses in terms of the cellular pathways exploited during the viral life cycle, resulting in similar membrane rearrangements. Electron tomography analysis of HCV\u2010infected cells has shown that about 50% of DMVs are linked to the ER via the outer membrane, giving rise to a neck\u2010like structure, but that they subsequently seem to detach from the donor membrane (Romero\u2010Brey et al., 2012). Recent investigations have suggested that HCV\u2010induced DMVs may derive from single\u2010membrane vesicles present as discrete clusters in the perinuclear area during the early events of viral infection (Ferraris et al., 2013) (Fig. 1). The direct detection of HCV proteins and RNA is difficult in ultrastructural studies, and the precise distribution of the viral components with respect to these rearranged membranes remains unclear in this model.",

            "text": "For viruses inducing single\u2010membrane invaginated vesicles or spherules, it is generally accepted that the viral replicase complexes reside on the invaginated membrane, and with RNA replication taking place in the vesicle lumen (den Boon and Ahlquist, 2010; den Boon et al., 2010). A neck\u2010like connection to the cytoplasm allows the import of all the required metabolites, including nucleotides, and the export of newly synthesized RNA destined for translation or packaging into a nucleocapsid. However, the situation remains unclear for viruses inducing DMVs, as both membranes of these DMVs are often sealed, with no connection to the cytoplasm (Knoops et al., 2008; Limpens et al., 2011; Romero\u2010Brey et al., 2012). For poliovius and CVB3, it has been suggested that viral replication occurs principally on the cytoplasmic side of the single\u2010membrane tubular vesicles, subsequently ceasing after these vesicles are wrapped in membranes to form sealed DMVs (Limpens et al., 2011; Belov et al., 2012). For SARS\u2010CoV and EAV, the viral RNA is found mostly in the lumen of DMVs, and it remains unclear whether viral replication occurs within the DMVs or on the cytosolic side of these vesicles (Knoops et al., 2008; 2012). Replication within the DMVs would require the import of metabolites and export of viral RNA, and the mechanisms by which these processes might occur remain unknown. Even with high\u2010resolution electron tomography, no neck\u2010like membrane structures or translocon\u2010like complexes have been observed in these viral models (Knoops et al., 2008; 2012). This has led to suggestions that DMVs are formed to conceal viral RNA, enabling it to escape the dsRNA\u2010triggered host antiviral response (Knoops et al., 2008). This hypothesis was supported by the results of a study based on the detection of RNA synthesis by live cell imaging, which showed that the subcellular compartments containing dsRNA (i.e. probable DMVs) were not necessarily the sites of active MHV replication (Hagemeijer et al., 2012). Furthermore, a panel of MHV mutants was recently used to demonstrate that viruses producing larger and more numerous DMVs in primary or continuous cell cultures have no fitness advantage (Al\u2010Mulla et al., 2014). This suggests that intracellular viral RNA synthesis can be at least partly dissociated from DMV formation.",

However, it remains unclear whether RNA replication takes place within DMVs or on their outer surface. Interestingly, electron tomography studies of HCV\u2010infected cells have shown that a small subset of DMVs (about 10%) have a pore\u2010like opening to the cytoplasm, whereas most have sealed inner and outer membranes (Romero\u2010Brey et al., 2012). This has led to suggestions that HCV replication occurs within the lumen of DMVs while they are linked to the cytosol, with the replication complexes ceasing to be active once the membranes of the DMVs are sealed.",

            "text": "DMVs are usually rare in cells, but large double\u2010membrane structures called autophagosomes, which engulf cytoplasmic components targeted for degradation, are induced during autophagy (Rubinsztein et al., 2012). Autophagosomes have thus been identified as a possible source of DMVs associated with viral replication. Lipidation of the cytosolic microtubule associated light chain 3 (LC3) protein with phosphatidylethanolamine, generating a membrane\u2010associated species known as LC3\u2010II, is a key event in the induction of autophagy (Xie et al., 2008). LC3\u2010II is associated with both the inner and outer membrane of the growing autophagosome, and this association is essential for autophagosome formation. The lipidation of LC3 has been observed after poliovirus and CVB3 infection (Taylor and Kirkegaard, 2007; Kemball et al., 2010). In addition, knocking\u2010down expression level of a key player in autophagosome formation, Atg5, has also been shown to decrease viral replication, although this knock\u2010down principally seems to affect the production of progeny viruses, suggesting a key role for autophagy in virus assembly and release (Jackson et al., 2005). In the coronavirus model, functional studies based on the knock\u2010down of Atg5 expression have yielded conflicting results. In one study, cells lacking Atg5 displayed levels of viral replication three orders of magnitude lower than those in cells containing Atg5, together with smaller numbers of DMVs (Prentice et al., 2004). By contrast, Atg5 had little impact on viral replication in another study (Zhao et al., 2007). These discrepancies may be due to differences in these studies in terms of cell lines used. Conflicting observations have also been reported for HCV. It is generally agreed that HCV induces autophagic signalling, but the specific role of autophagy during HCV infection remains unclear. Autophagy has been shown to be essential for translation of the viral genome, but dispensable after the infection has begun in some studies (Dreux et al., 2009), whereas others have suggested that it is involved in initiating RNA replication (Sir et al., 2008; Gu\u00e9vin et al., 2010). In another report, knocking down the expression of autophagy genes was found to have no effect on virus translation and RNA replication, but be essential for HCV particle assembly and release (Tanida et al., 2009). It has also been suggested that HCV induces autophagy to down\u2010regulate the innate immune response, thereby favouring viral replication (Ke and Chen, 2011). Again, the discrepancies between the results of these studies may reflect the use of different subclones of the Huh7 hepatoma cell line.",

            "text": "The role of autophagy in the biogenesis of virus\u2010induced DMVs thus remains unclear. Autophagy is clearly activated in viral infections associated with DMVs, but this does not mean that all virus\u2010induced DMVs are autophagosomes. Other differences between virus\u2010induced DMVs and cellular autophagosomes include the smaller size of these virus\u2010induced organelles and their persistence as double\u2010membrane structures. Cellular autophagosomes mature by fusing with lysosomes. This enables them to acquire degradative machinery, but also causes them to lose their double\u2010membrane structure within as little as 30 min after their formation (Haas, 2007). It is difficult to determine whether the assembly of viral replicase complexes results directly in the formation of DMVs or whether DMVs are actually modified autophagosomes. Nevertheless, Western\u2010blotting on isolated DMVs and immunogold labelling electron microscopy studies have suggested that at least some HCV\u2010induced DMVs may be derived from autophagosomes, as they are strongly positive for LC3\u2010II (Ferraris et al., 2010). It has recently been shown that the non\u2010structural nsp6 proteins of various coronaviruses can generate small ER\u2010derived autophagosomes called omegasomes, which are normally formed during the initial stages of autophagy (Cottam et al., 2011). These proteins also inhibit the autophagosome expansion observed in regular autophagy processes (Cottam et al., 2014). Other studies have suggested that DMVs are instead related to vesicles called EDEMosomes. EDEMosomes are devoted to the elimination of EDEM proteins to tune down the ER\u2010associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (Reggiori et al., 2010). In this model, DMVs recruit non\u2010lipidated LC3\u2010I, by a pathway not strictly related to autophagy, but nevertheless requiring components of the autophagy pathway.",

            "text": "It should also be pointed out that the induction of autophagy or related pathways to enhance viral replication is not restricted to DMV\u2010inducing viruses. In addition to its direct contribution to the formation of rearranged membranes by providing support for replication complexes, autophagy can promote viral replication in several other ways. Early studies showed that some viruses induce the autophagic pathway while inhibiting the associated degradation activity, but more recent studies have indicated that, in some cases, viruses can promote the generation of degradative autolysosomes, the final compartments in the process of autophagy (Richards and Jackson, 2013). For example, dengue virus infection leads to autophagy\u2010mediated lipid droplet degradation, a process referred to as lipophagy (Heaton and Randall, 2010). This results in the mobilization of triglycerides, which are used for adenosine triphosphate production via \u03b2\u2010oxidation, a process required for efficient viral replication. A role of autophagy in promoting viral assembly and release has also been demonstrated in various viral models including hepatitis B virus (Li et al., 2011), human immunodeficiency virus (Kyei et al., 2009), but also DMV\u2010inducing viruses, such as poliovirus (Richards and Jackson, 2012) and HCV (Tanida et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Ever since the first pioneering ultrastructural observations of virus\u2010induced DMVs, the biogenesis and role of these structures in viral infection have been the subject of debate. Components of the cellular autophagy pathway or related pathways seem to be involved in the life cycle of DMV\u2010inducing viruses, but the link between autophagy and DMV biogenesis remains unclear. In various viral models, the production of viral proteins, either alone or in combination, has led to the identification of proteins sufficient to induce the formation of DMVs (Neuman et al., 2014; Romero\u2010Brey and Bartenschlager, 2014). It has also recently been shown, in a cell\u2010free assay, that a single poliovirus protein (3AB) is sufficient to induce the formation of a double\u2010membrane liposome via membrane curvature, leading to the invagination of a single\u2010membrane liposome (Wang et al., 2013). It is therefore plausible that, in infected cells, one or several viral proteins replace the host\u2010cell proteins involved in autophagosome biogenesis, or work together with these host\u2010cell proteins, to form the virus\u2010induced DMVs. This may account for the inhibition of autophagy resulting to various effects on viral replication, depending on the cell type used. Once formed, DMVs could act as a scaffold for the assembly of viral replication complexes by providing an organization and environment facilitating viral replication. These DMVs may later be completely sealed, such that the viral RNA they contain is no longer actively engaged in the RNA amplification process. This would enable the virus to escape the dsRNA\u2010triggered antiviral response of the host cell. In parallel, autophagy may enhance the viral life cycle through mechanisms other than the formation of rearranged membranes, including viral assembly and release. The diverse conclusions of recent studies provide an equivocal picture of the sequence of events involved and further studies will be required to determine the roles of viral/cellular factors and the molecular pathways involved in the life cycle of DMV\u2010inducing viruses. This will not only improve our understanding of viral replication, but will probably also shed light on the ways in which autophagy and other related pathways are regulated.",
