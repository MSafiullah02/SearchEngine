To this end, we first recorded, for each determination of D-dimer levels, whether the patient had developed PE 3, 6, 9 or 12 days after that determination. Then, separately for each of these time lags (e.g., 3 days), we fitted a mixed-effects logistic regression, with the presence of PE as the dependent binary variable (i.e., the future outcome that we wished to predict), D-dimer levels as the independent variable (i.e., the variable that we wished to use for predicting), and the subject identification as a random factor (to adjust for repeated measures). Initially we also aimed to conduct this analysis using shorter time lags (1 or 2 days), but we could not correctly fit the corresponding mixed-effects logistic regressions due to singularity.",

Zhou and cols, in a retrospective, multicentric cohort study conducted in China described increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with d-dimer greater than 1 \u03bcg/mL on admission [4] . Tang et al [5] , in a series that included 183 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, found that patients with abnormal coagulation results, especially markedly elevated D-dimer and fibrin degradation product levels, had a higher risk of death. Furthermore, Gao and cols found that D-dimer levels were closely related to the occurrence of severe COVID-19 disease in adult patients [6] . In line with these findings, anticoagulant treatment has been found to be associated with decreased mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 disease meeting the criteria for sepsis-induced coagulopathy or with markedly elevated D-dimer levels. [7] Recently, several authors have suggested an association between COVID-19 pneumonia and VTE. Some authors have described the prevalence of VTE in severely ill patients [9, 10] . In the study by Cui et al [9] the prevalence of VTE was 25%, with a sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value of D-dimer cut-off value of 1.5 \u00b5g/mL of 85, 88.5 and 94.7%, respectively. Klok and cols [10] reported an incidence of 31% of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection. In this study, the authors did not analyze the association between levels of D-dimer and the occurrence of thrombotic events.",

Our data would suggest that despite the high D-dimer value at admission, its rapid increment is associated with a significant risk of PE. Although the ultimate aim of our study would be to use D-dimer levels to predict the development of PE and thus prevent it, we would like to highlight that our results should be taken with caution until they are replicated with other data.",
