Substitution of the SCoV SL1 for the MHV SL1, which also increases the spacing between the predicted MHV SL1 and SL2 by 2 nts, did not affect viral viability, but it did decrease viral replication efficiency.

Our data indicate the TRS may function in the synthesis of minus strand genome RNA as well, perhaps by mediating formation of 5'-end 3'-end complex, either by RNA-RNA, protein-RNA or protein-protein interactions.
