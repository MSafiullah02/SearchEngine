            "text": "A recent study by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team shows that in the UK and US context, suppression requires a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases, and household quarantine of their family members, that may need school and university closures and reports other strategies that may involve social distancing of those >70 years old. However, the study predicts that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed and suggests that intermittent social distancing \u2212 triggered by trends in disease surveillance \u2212 may allow interventions to be relaxed temporarily [15]. This strategy needs robust surveillance systems that allow for acceptable sensitivity to timely decide on interventions. We believe these triggers must consider evidence and debate around surveillance system sensitivity and under-ascertainment. As suggested by another Imperial College Report [16], this would be relevant to produce early evidence when exiting the COVID-19 social distancing policy after achieving containment.",

Undetected introduction of imported cases and many mild undetected cases making up those transmission chains may warrant early measures. By looking at the death epidemic curves (likely less sensitive to variations in surveillance system sensitivity) of different countries we see differences that can be related to earlier detection and implementation of measures (Fig. 4). Notably, South Korea has managed to keep new deaths by COVID-19 low despite being in a relatively advanced stage of the epidemic and is one of the countries with a higher testing rate [8]. An early study [17] estimated the transmission potential of COVID-19 in the country and suggested early sustained disease transmission in the region which contributed to the rapid early implementation of social distancing measures to contain the outbreak [14].",

With more epidemiological evidence, namely greater certainty in relation to the proportion of asymptomatic infections and their risk of transmission, different surveillance system sensitivity, effective R in different contexts and effectiveness of containment measures and with the results of the First Few X Cases FFX investigation proposed by WHO [18] for COVID-19 models will better take into account under-ascertainment in different countries.
