Our investigation suggests that for cases reported in this study, the H7N9 virus was not transmitted from the case-patients to their household contacts after prolonged and unprotected exposure. Consistent with the observations in studies of H7N9 virus transmission in animal models, our results indicate that compared with globally disseminated seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses, the H7N9 virus is not readily transmitted in certain household settings [10], [11], [12], [13].",
