Following the city of Wuhan and the province of Hubei, European healthcare systems are facing an outbreak of seriously ill patients, but few are fully equipped to deal with this health crisis. In this totally unprecedented and unexpected context, we must readapt the procedures with respect to the care of patients with liver disease. The aims of this document are to examine what is currently known about the relationship between COVID-19 and the liver, and to anticipate the safest possible care procedures in order to reduce the impact of the pandemic on patients with liver disease.",

To date the mechanism involved is unclear. Indeed, data suggesting the possibility of localisation of the virus in the liver are preliminary, and it is plausible that elevated liver enzymes in the context of COVID-19 infection could be related to the inflammatory response syndrome, drug induced toxicities (paracetamol, antibiotics), and ischemia liver or viral myocarditis frequent in this situation. Moreover, serological testing for hepatotropic viruses is recommended in this situation;\u2022the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor (the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor) by cholangiocytes [8];\u2022the fact that populations believed to be at risk for severe forms of COVID-19 include patients with cirrhosis, those with autoimmune hepatitis on immunosuppressive drugs, and pre- and post-transplant patients on immunosuppressive therapy [9].\n",
