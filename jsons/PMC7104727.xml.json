            "text": "Coronavirus (CoV) is an enveloped, positive, single-stranded RNA virus that causes mild upper respiratory infections in humans. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by a de novo coronavirus\u2014MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV was originally isolated from an Arab patient who died of respiratory failure and renal failure in 2012, and was classified as a member of the CoV family, which is lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus. From April 2012 to 22 May 2019, the total global number of laboratory-confirmed MERS cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) was 2428, with 838 associated deaths, or a fatality of about 35% (40.43% in Saudi Arabia) [1]. Aside from MERS-CoV, only a few other CoVs are known to infect humans; these include human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E, HCoV-NL63, HKU1, and OC43, which usually result in relatively mild respiratory disease [2], [3]. However, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and MERS-CoV are highly pathogenic and lead to high mortality, especially in the elderly and in immunocompromised patients [4], [5]. MERS has broken out in 27 countries around the world, with major outbreaks occurring in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Korea. The dromedary camel is the largest intermediate host for MERS-CoV, and bats are considered to be animal sources of MERS-CoV. However, the specific role of dromedaries in the transmission of the virus is not yet clear. To date, in addition to the safety and tolerability of the fully human polyclonal Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody (SAB-301), which is described as a putative therapeutic agent specific for MERS, no effective vaccines or antibodies have been reported for human immunization and therapy [6]. Therefore, different intervention methods are need to treat MERS patients, including control of transmission. In this review, we describe the structure and potential functions of the reported MERS-CoV proteins, and discuss how their respective intervention strategies prevent virus transmission.",

The internal subdomains are relatively conserved among CoVs [12], whereas the structure of the external subdomains in CoVs varies greatly; the external subdomains mainly participate in receptor binding, resulting in the use of different receptors between CoVs. The RBD is responsible for the binding of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4, also known as human CD26). Interestingly, MERS-RBD can induce strong production of antibodies in vivo, which indicates that the S protein has a good immunogenicity for the induction of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) [13], [14], [15], [16]. The immunogenicity and protective potential of the NTD have been studied, and the recombinant N-terminal domain (rNTD) is a candidate vaccine against MERS [17].",

Three HR2 chains in the HR1 side groove core emit three HR1 spirals, forming a central coiled spiral core that is a key membrane fusion structure [18], [19]. Upon binding of S1 and DPP4, HR1 binds HR2 to form a temporary intermediate structure, causing the viral and cell membranes to move in close proximity to fuse the membranes.",

First, furin recognizes the R751/S752 position and cleaves the S protein during biosynthesis.

The SARS-CoV N protein can increase replication by overexpression [29]. The nucleocapsid structure not only requires the recognition of the characteristic sequences of the viral RNA, but also must recognize binding to other structural viral proteins. After the N protein forms a complex with the viral genomic RNA, the RNA is protected from destruction by nucleases in the host cell [30]. X-ray diffraction measurement at very high resolution (2.4 \u00c5) was used to discover an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and an NTD at the N-terminus of the N protein.

Once the mannose-binding lectin recognizes the mannan on the surface of the virus-infected cell, it recruits MASP2 and then activates its enzymatic activity, eventually causing a local or systemic inflammatory response. EF-1A acts as a translation elongation factor, and catalyzes the aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site in the ribosome. EF-1A can play a regulatory role in the assembly of the cytoskeleton, microfilaments, and cytokinesis rings. The interaction between the MERS-CoV N protein and EF-1A disrupts the formation of cytokinesis loops and inhibits lymphocyte proliferation, which may explain the reduction in the number of lymphocytes in patients with MERS.",

In addition, the lack of cell homologs of human nsp5 makes it an ideal target for antiviral drug design [43]. The adaptive evolution of nsp3 in MERS-CoV strains is ongoing.

At the same time, the C-terminus of nsp1 targets TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF-3) to inhibit the production of IFN-\u03b2 [57]. In addition, activation of interferon-regulated transcription factor 3 (IRF3) [58] and PKR can be inhibited by other nsp1 domains [59]. Nsp1 of CoV may also interact with cyclophilin, and is considered to be a major virulence factor because it degrades host mRNA. The mRNA degradation activity of MERS-CoV nsp1 is separate from its translational inhibitory function. Furthermore, certain residues of MERS-CoV nsp1 are crucial for evading translational shutdown [46]. The escape of MERS-CoV mRNAs from inhibition by MERS-CoV nsp1 is promoted by their cytoplasmic origin [60].",

            "text": "Explosive epidemics of MERS-CoV pose a serious threat to global public health and emphasize the need to further investigate the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this virus, in addition to developing effective therapeutic and preventive drugs against MERS-CoV infection. Despite rapid advances in diagnostics and public health measures, new MERS-CoV cases are still being reported. This suggests that multiple interventions targeting different affected populations may be necessary to stop these outbreaks. As described herein, the structural information associated with the MERS-CoV proteins may be used to develop different potential interventions to limit the outbreak of MERS-CoV. There is a need to better understand the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in order to identify viral and host factors that play an important role in the development of MERS in humans; this may provide potentially novel therapeutic and intervention options.",
