            "text": "Mathematical models are often regarded as recent innovations in the description and analysis of infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics, but simple models have been in use for projection of epidemic trajectories for more than a century. We recently described a single equation model (the incidence decay with exponential adjustment, or IDEA, model) that can be used for short term forecasting. In the mid-19th century, Dr. William Farr developed a single equation approach (\"Farr's law\") for epidemic forecasting. We show here that the two models are in fact identical, and can be expressed in terms of one another, and also in terms of a susceptibleinfectious-removed (SIR) compartmental model with improving control. This demonstrates that the concept of the reproduction number (R0) is implicit to Farr's (pre-microbial era) work, and also suggests that control of epidemics, whether via behavior change or intervention, is as integral to the natural history of epidemics as is the dynamics of disease transmission.",

Nonetheless, the threat of communicable diseases persists; emerging infectious diseases continue to be identified, often in association with changes in human and animal mobility, agricultural practices, environmental degradation, and misuse of antimicrobial therapy [7] [8] [9] . Recent outbreaks or epidemics associated with MERS coronavirus [10] , influenza A(H7N9) [11] , and the West African emergence of the Zaire strain of Ebola virus [12] , have challenged epidemiologists as the natural history, modes of transmission, and/or means of control of these diseases have not been well understood during initial periods of emergence.",

While it may be challenging to parameterize detailed mechanistic mathematical models when there is little information on mechanisms of transmission, baseline immunity in a community, the nature of the infecting pathogen, et cetera, a number of descriptive approaches exist which may permit fitting, and forecasting, of an epidemic curve. One single equation approach that has been applied to emerging infections is the Richards model, which treats cumulative infections as a logistic growth process [14] . However, the concept of modeling an epidemic curve as a simple function, without reference to mechanisms of transmission, is in fact much older, and may originate in the work of the English polymath Dr. William Farr (1807 Farr ( -1883 , who rose from humble beginnings to become a physician, mathematician, hygienist and protege of Lancet founder Dr. Thomas Wakley [15] [16] [17] . Dr. Farr spent almost 40 years at the General Register Office of the United Kingdom, and the esteem in which he was held is apparent in the \"letters\" he published annually as appendices to the reports of the Registrar General, in which he supplemented the dry statistical reports with thoughtful and creative musings on topics as wide-ranging as the relationships between occupation and disease, suicide and mortality in the mentally ill, population density and mortality, and as above the \"laws\" governing epidemics [18] .",

He used related methods over 25 years later, to refute the assertion by a British parliamentarian that a rinderpest epidemic in British cattle would continue to grow exponentially over time [16, 17] .

This two-parameter model, which we have referred to as the \"Incidence Decay with Exponential Adjustment\" (IDEA) model, offers advantages of simplicity, explicit linkage to theory of epidemic growth, and also acknowledges the fact that epidemics and outbreaks do not peak and end simply due to depletion of susceptibles, but because of a complex constellation of public health actions and behavioral changes that may modify the course of an epidemic and reduce the effective reproductive number R e (t) of an outbreak [22] . One of us (PF) had previously written about Farr's rule and its importance in the development of epidemic theory [15] , and noted the conceptual similarity between IDEA and Farr's rule. Upon exploration of these two approaches we realized that they are, notwithstanding having been formulated some 160 years apart, and being based on very different theoretical constructs, identical. Here we demonstrate the equivalence of these methods for epidemic modeling and forecasting, and explore the potential advantages of using these methodologies to complement other approaches. We explore numerical examples derived from current emerging infectious diseases, including the West African Ebola virus outbreak. We show that these methodologies work fairly well in a number of cases, and discuss what this fact implies about difficult-to-measure components of transmission and control parameters.",

The empirical underpinnings of d are not yet well defined, but based on current understanding of disease dynamics could represent public health interventions, population adaptation or behavior change, improved availability of personal protective items or effect of drugs to treat infection, or reductions in population susceptibility as a result of infection or vaccination.

Estimation of variance of log(K) makes it possible to estimate confidence limits for K, and thus for d. Furthermore, given that several K estimates can be generated from a given epidemic curve, estimation of variance should permit the use of Mantel-Haenszel methods [37] to generate summary estimates of K over the course of an epidemic, or to use meta-regressive methods to evaluate K for trends [36] .

We have subsequently realized, and demonstrate above, that our approach simply represented a restatement of Farr's work, albeit in a manner that is tied to the concept of R 0 . According to Brownlee, Farr promised to describe the derivation of his model in greater detail in future reports, but never did so [16] , and much of the mathematical elaboration of Farr's work was in fact done by Brownlee after Farr's death [27] . Nonetheless, Brownlee notes that to Farr, the predictive accuracy of his approach reflected three characteristics of epidemics, according to Farr's (pre-microbial) understanding: (i) diminution in the number of susceptibles over time due to recovery from infection (\"immunity\", though to use this term in application to Farr is an anachronism); (ii) diminished population density due to death from infection; and (iii) diminishing pathogenicity of the disease with each passing generation of infection as a result of (to quote Farr) \"[loss of] part of the force of infection in every body through which they pass...the matter...diminishes in strength at every transmission by innoculation\" [16] . The first two characteristics are not incompatible with the current understanding of epidemic dynamics, whereas the third is not (though it does anticipate more modern ideas around evolution of virulence and disease ecology [29, 30] ).",

We presume that public health interventions, population behavior change (as a result of education or rumours, prudence or fear), and the occurrence of silent infections with immunity could all contribute to deceleration of epidemic spread, even when the effective reproductive number is expected to be greater than 1 due to widespread susceptibility in the population. Furthermore, we note that Farr's original \"time step\" appears to have been arbitrary (reflecting the form of data available to him: weekly for rinderpest, quarterly for smallpox), whereas we have used generations as time steps in our more recent applications of Farr's \"law\", and in IDEA and SIR models.

Our contribution in the current work is to show that Farr's law, while derived in the pre-microbial era, can be reformulated in terms of the concept of the basic reproductive number, combined with exponential increase in control via whatever mechanism. We observe, unexpectedly, that Farr's K can be expressed as a function of the IDEA d parameter alone, independent of R 0 , implying that epidemic trajectory is (and has historically been) more a function of control efforts and changing behavior than of the fundamental characteristics of a given infectious disease. Whether or not the ratio K can have stand-alone value as a tool to identify unexpected shifts in epidemic trajectory (e.g., the two wave epidemic of Chikungunya referred to in Figure 7 above) will be the subject of future work. Assume that the parameters R 0 and d \u2265 0, in the IDEA model, describe accurately the observed number of infected cases as a function of (serial) time, in an ideal outbreak. Then we can substitute I(t) from equation (3) into equation (1) to see if the sequential number of infected individuals, as predicted by the IDEA model, satisfy Farr's law.",
