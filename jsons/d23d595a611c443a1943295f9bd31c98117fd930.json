In the early days, these numbers showed an increasing trend. Recently, the numbers have been generally flattened out. This report tries to estimate the hidden number of currently alive infections in the population by using the confirmed cases. A major result indicates an existing infections estimate at about 10-50 times the daily confirmed new cases, with the stringent social distancing policy tipping to the upper end of this range. It clarifies the relationship between the infection rate and the test rate to put the epidemic under control, which says that the test rate shall keep up at the same pace as infection rate to prevent an outbreak. This relationship is meaningful in the wake of business re-opening in the U.S. and the world. The report also reveals the connections of all the measures taken to the epidemic spread. A stratified sampling method is proposed to add to the current tool kits of epidemic control. Again, this report is a summary of some straight observations and thoughts, not through a thorough study backed with field data. The results appear obvious and suitable for general education to interested policymakers and the public.",

It has brought much of the world economy to a halt. Countries quickly motioned to put it under control. It is an anxious, agonizing process checking the newly confirmed cases of infection and death each day for such an extended, long time. People have observed Italy, Spain, and other countries after China that have been inflicted by this pandemic. Now the U.S. became the seemingly world epicenter with a total confirmed infections exceeding one and half million [1] . As people watch on the daily spread of this pandemic, few know when this pandemic will be put to an end or whether it will spiral out of control again, although pundits worldwide have publicized many findings and predicts. What the general public observe each day are newly confirmed cases from day to day as well as the cumulative totals. The trend of the newly confirmed cases each day was increasing in the early days and is now pretty flattened out overall under the prevalent shelter-in-place policy [2] . What does this trend mean ? We try to answer the question and also examine a condition under which a stable, flat trend is sustainable. Such an examination appears especially meaningful as the U.S. and the world approach to massive business reopening.",

            "text": "In an attempt to understand the driving factors of the epidemic spread, our perspective is different from most mainstream literature of epidemiology. The literature in epidemiology such as [3, 4, 5] generally simulate the interactive process of epidemic transmissive behaviors in a closed region by also considering population migration in and out in order to duplicate the transmissive process. The simulation realizes the mechanism expressed in an array of partial differential equations [6, 7] , in which the transmission rate is affected by the percentage of the infected in a nonlinear manner. Similar to the literature in epidemiology such as [8, 9] , we try to understand and gauge the hidden world of the infected population, including the latent and active ones that are not detected yet. However, our method to estimate the undetected number of currently latent and active infections is based on the publicized numbers of the daily confirmed cases without having to resort to the epidemic process simulation. Our result is simpler and easier to understand and use. Note that this note treats the latent and active as in one undetected group with a comprehensive infection rate. We allow a different aggregate infection rate for each day. Our weakness is that this report takes infection rate and detection rate as given parameters. This report does not study their specific values. Current literature report that the total infected population could be six to ten times the cumulative total confirmed [9] . Our finding shows that the total currently latent and active cases can be six to sixty times the incremental daily confirmed total in today's situation that the daily confirmations seem on a flat trend. This findings implies the total infections from 1 to about 10 times the total confirmed infections. One may also gauge the growth or declination of the infections in light of a necessary and sufficient condition for epidemic control that we have found in this report.",

Problem statement There is a group of infected people on day one. Out of them, N 1 is confirmed and quarantined. On day i, each infected case that is not confirmed and quarantined, referred to as hidden cases, grows at a daily rate of r i into more cases. At the end of each day i, hidden cases each have a probability p i being detected and put into quarantine while the undetected cases continue the infection the next day. The growth rate of r i is the net growth rate, which is the difference between the new infections deducted by the recovered and dead. Day by day over a period of time, newly confirmed cases are reported by the number N 1 , N 2 , ..., and N n .The study is to use the daily confirmed numbers of infections to estimate the hidden infections and their trend of growth or declination. The goal is to propose measures for the epidemic control.",

The number of hidden cases is the primary interest here. Be aware that the growth rate r i here is different from the transmission rate in the conventional epidemiology literature [9] , where the transmission rate is the number of infections that a currently active one may incur per day during the short span of active period. We assume that the confirmed cases have been perfectly quarantined and have lost their ability of further infection. One may consider their remnant infectious ability, even if under quarantine, is implicitly incorporated into the infectious capability of the hidden cases by allowing for a slightly higher rate r i . We simplify the process from the perspective of someone outside epidemiology by assuming each infected case has an equal average growth rate, which may not be accurate. One may take this growth rate as an aggregate measure of all the hidden cases as a whole. Note we include the latent also in the hidden cases. For COVID-19, some reports declare that the latent cases may also be infectious. The net infection (or net growth) rate is random. It is reasonable to assume a constant average rate with fluctuations (e.g., random outcomes) between days for a period over which the test means, ability, and policy do not change significantly.",

If p n is very close to zero, in a conservative estimation, say p n \u2248 0.01, the total hidden infected population would be about 100 times larger than the latest average daily confirmed amount.

Our simple result suggests that the total current infections in the communities, excluding the quarantined, probably would be in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 million. In the case that schools and businesses are reopened in the near future, where people reasonably practice social distancing and follow other published preventive guidelines, a new situation between the conservative and moderate scenarios listed above, if the new infection has flattened out or has reached a new equilibrium, the total hidden infections alive on the day would reasonably be in a range of 10-20 times the daily confirmed cases.

Nodes and strings all have varying attributes that contribute to the virus spread to different degrees. Schools, including k-12 and college education when face-to-face classes are resumed may be considered high-risk nodes.

This discussion has touched on the means in two categories, detection and infection rates control, respectively. Enhanced social tracing may be an effective means of increasing the detection rate. The detection rate here is the probability of a random infection in a community to be selected and tested for infection Random sampling based on strata is also proposed, which emphasizes the strata likelihood and also strata severity of infection. A principle is that the sample rate shall be consistent with the strata infection rate weighted by infection consequence. Note that direct sampling for infection test may turn out to be too costly.

One may estimate the total alive infections hidden out in the communities of up to 50 times the daily confirmations. Note that the same day total alive infections of 50 times the daily confirmation is equivalent to a total cumulative infections of about 10 times the cumulative daily infections. This estimate may serve as an alert to the policymakers when they prepare for business reopening. Those undetected infections would incur a higher infection rate during business re-opening and require a higher detection rate accordingly. The needed higher detection rate would come from a heightened contact tracing system, which is desirably coupled with new community sampling practice.",
