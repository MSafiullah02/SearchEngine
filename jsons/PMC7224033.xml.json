In cattle, MAP causes chronic enteritis, clinically characterized by diarrhea, weight loss, and progressive emaciation that leads to reduced production and premature culling or death (Mortier et al. 2015). Transmission of MAP is generally initiated with the oral ingestion of MAP bacilli excreted in feces or milk (Derakhshani et al. 2016; Corbett et al. 2018). This infection with MAP often occurs during the first months of life and elicits a slowly progressive inflammatory response in the gastrointestinal tract, not clinically apparent for months or years. Moreover, only a minority of cattle (10\u201315%) exposed to MAP eventually develop clinical disease (Mortier et al. 2015).",

Macrophages are primary target cells for MAP persistance and replication (Koets et al. 2015), but they may elicit bactericidal effects in controlling the bacterium. In this host-pathogen interaction, mycobacteria interact with several Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on macrophages, including TLR-2 and TLR-4 (Quesniaux et al. 2004). Signaling of MAP through TLR-2 suppress antimicrobial responses and antigen presentation in macrophages (Weiss et al. 2008). The location of MAP into phagosomes within macrophages aids in the bacterial survival by blocking phagosome acidification and limiting fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes (Sturgill-Koszycki et al. 1994). However, when activated (e.g., by stimulation with interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3)), macrophages can eliminate intracellular mycobacteria through increased synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) (Sohal et al. 2008) and lysosomal degradation (Alonso et al. 2007).",

            "text": "Murine models have been key to study MAP pathogenesis. Whereas mice are not natural host of MAP and some mice strains (e.g., C3H) are resistant to MAP infection (Chiodini and Buergelt 1993; Tanaka et al. 1994), experimental challenge with MAP via intraperitoneal (Huntley et al. 2005; Shin et al. 2006), endovenous (Rosseels et al. 2006), and oral (Cooney et al. 2014) routes reproduced histological and immunological features similar to those observed in ruminants (Hines et al. 2007). Moreover, murine macrophages (including phagocytic J774.A1 cells) have been used to decipher host mycobacteria interactions and intracellular growth characteristics of MAP (Kuehnel et al. 2001; Hostetter et al. 2003; Sonawane et al. 2011; Santos et al. 2014). In search for therapeutics that can \u201cinstruct\u201d macrophages to control MAP, cathelicidins, small cationic peptides produced by neutrophils, macrophages, and epithelial cells with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and enveloped viruses, are of interest (Zanetti 2005; Holani et al. 2018). Cathelicidins are present in many mammalian species, with several cathelicidins reported in cattle (Young-Speirs et al. 2018). Humans and mice are unique species to study these peptides, as there is only one type of cathelicidins in humans (cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide CAP-18 or leucine-leucine with 37 amino acids residue (LL-37)) and in mice (cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP)) (Zanetti 2005). LL-37 is a unique target molecule drug model for mycobacteria related diseases, as it has antimicrobial activity against M. smegmatis, M. bovis BCG, and M. tuberculosis (H37Rv), in both human monocyte-derived macrophages and murine macrophages (Sonawane et al. 2011). However, the role of cathelicidins in MAP, as antimicrobial or immunomodulator, is largely unknown. Thus, we aimed to characterize the fate of MAP in macrophages treated with synthetic LL-37, as a cathelicidin model, to assess its therapeutic potential in controlling MAP infection.",

Both MAP strains were cultured in Middlebrook (MB) 7H9 medium containing 0.2% glycerol, 10% oleic acid-dextrose-catalase (OADC), and mycobactin J (2.0 mg/L) (Allied Monitor) at 37 \u00b0C, in a shaking incubator at 120 rpm. To visualize the mycobacteria inside macrophages, MAPs expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were obtained by the transformation of the wild-type strains with a recombinant (pWES-4) plasmid expressing the GFP (Parker and Bermudez 1997). GFP MAPs were selectively cultured adding kanamycin (100 \u03bcg/mL). Both MAP K10 GFP (Parker and Bermudez 1997) and MAP A1 157 GFP were comparatively evaluated through macrophage invasion to confirm the MAP virulence after transformation. Cultured MAP concentration (bacteria/mL) was calculated by turbidity absorbance at 600 nm (OD600 0.5 equivalent to 1 \u00d7 108 cells/mL) (Lamont et al. 2012).",

            "text": "Effects of cathelicidin controlling mycobacterial infections in macrophages have been reported. Endogenous overexpression of murine cathelicidin and synthetic human LL-37 (and derived LLKKK-18) increased intracellular killing of M. smegmatis, M. bovis, and M. tuberculosis in murine macrophages (Sonawane et al. 2011). However, the antibacterial effect of LL-37 on MAP described here is novel. We found synthetic LL-37 at doses (up to 10 \u03bcM) below half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) (Sonawane et al. 2011) reduced MAP burden in macrophaghes as detected by MAP specific qPCR counting and internalized MAP by confocal microscopy. Moreover, we demonstrated that this cathelicidin dose (up to 10 \u03bcM) has no relevant direct anti-mycobacterial effects on MAP. This finding suggests an immunomodulatory role of exogenous LL-37 increasing the antibacterial defenses in macrophages. Such immunomodulatory effects of low doses of LL-37 have been reported. For instance, low LL-37 dosage (< 1 \u03bcM) inhibited TNF-\u03b1 release from LPS-induced macrophages (Mookherjee et al. 2006). Noteworthy, the tested LL-37 concentrations were physiologic, similar to those found in mucosal surfaces in humans (0.5\u20134 \u03bcM) (Schaller-Bals et al. 2002), suggesting this function of cathelicidins modulating macrophage behavior may occur in natural conditions. Higher doses of LL-37 (> 5, up to 20 \u03bcM) have been found also detrimental for mycobacteria (Sonawane et al. 2011), and we showed LL-37 at 50 \u03bcM directly killed some MAP. However, such high doses of cathelicidin with direct killing effect may concur with cytotoxic side outcomes. Thus, the role of cathelicidin stimulating macrophage functions rather than bactericidal effects is of special interest in developing new anti-infectious therapeutics. Regarding naturally occurring host defense peptides, transcriptional gene levels of cathelicidins and related host defense \u03b2-defensin in macrophages did not change during the first 24 h after MAP infection. In contrast, other mycobacteria, M. smegmatis and M. bovis (BCG), upregulated endogenous synthesis of cathelicidins in murine macrophages as early as 1 to 3 h, followed by a rapid decrease after 24 h (Sonawane et al. 2011). MAP may require longer exposure to induce endogenous cathelicidin-coding gene expression in macrophages or MAP has pathogenic mechanisms to prevent effective innate immune responses.",

            "text": "TLR-2 is key in mycobacterial pathogenesis; it may facilitate engulfment of the bacterium into the cytosol (Fournier 2013) and trigger production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and reactive oxygen species (Yang et al. 2009). In the present study, exogenous LL-37 downregulated the early gene expression of TLR-2 in murine macrophages with no detectable changes in total TLR-2 protein. Reduced TLR-2 availability in macrophages exposed to exogenous cathelicidins may be responsible for impaired engulfment of MAP and thus indirectly reduce immune inflammatory responses, although the surface protein variations may not be noticed by western blotting. Mycobacterial cell wall lipoproteins such as mannosylated lipoarabinomannan may be TLR-2 agonists (Gomes et al. 2008) and initiate signaling though the MAPK-p38 pathway (Arsenault et al. 2014). In fact, a specific lipopeptide (19 kDa) isolated from M. tuberculosis stimulated TLR-2 in macrophages and up-regulated expression of vitamin D receptor, leading to cathelicidin synthesis and killing of intracellular mycobacteria (Liu et al. 2006). Furthermore, TLR-2 signaling promoted endogenous cathelicidin gene expression in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages exposed to M. avium (Santos et al. 2014) and in human macrophages (THP-1) challenged by M. tuberculosis (Yang et al. 2009). Equally important for MAP signaling, TLR-4 has been implicated in pro-inflammatory cytokine production during MAP infection in human and murine macrophages (Ferwerda et al. 2007) and antigen-presenting cells (Lee et al. 2014). However, our study did not find TLR-4 gene expression modification by synthetic cathelicidins. Dysregulated expression of TLR-2 and TLR-4 (i.e., polymorphisms or mutations) made cattle more susceptible to Johne\u2019s disease (Mucha et al. 2009). Thus, the proposed role of synthetic LL-37 modulating certain TLRs in macrophages during MAP infection (e.g., TLR-2) may have therapeutic potential in genetically vulnerable cattle.",

            "text": "Increased production of TNF-\u03b1 in response to MAP occurs in a range of cells, including bovine macrophages (Colavecchia et al. 2016), human macrophages and epithelial cells (Wang et al. 2014), and murine dendritic cells (Lee et al. 2014). Exaggerated secretion of TNF-\u03b1 contributes to inflammatory damage during MAP infection, including granuloma formation in the ileum (portal of entry for mycobacteria) and in wasting disease (Adams and Czuprynski 1994). Moreover, anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapeutics for treating related chronic diseases (Crohn\u2019s disease) are associated with lesser mucosal inflammation and granuloma formation (Berns and Hommes 2016). In the present study, we found cathelicidin significatively reduce TNF-\u03b1 mRNA and slightly secreted protein levels. Differences in cytokine kinetic between gene transcription and protein synthesis are indicative that longer exposure with cathelicidins (or higher doses) may be needed to suppress the protein synthesis. This cathelicidin-driven anti-TNF-\u03b1 effect may have clinically relevant anti-inflammatory activity in Johne\u2019s disease, reducing tissue damage induced by MAP-activated macrophages. Another key pro-inflammatory cytokine, IFN-\u03b3, was also disminished by exogenous cathelicidin in macrophages infected with MAP. There was synergy between IFN-\u03b3 and TLR-2 ligands to upregulate cathelicidin expression in human monocytes and macrophages (Rode et al. 2017). Consequently, suppression of IFN-\u03b3 and TLR-2 gene expression by exogenous LL-37 could prevent endogenous cathelicidin production. In addition, reduced TNF-\u03b1 production in macrophages treated with LL-37 may further contribute to reduced synthesis of endogenous cathelicidin, as TNF-\u03b1 knockdown mice infected with M. avium had reduced cathelicidin expression (Santos et al. 2014).",

In agreement, synthetic LL-37 increased synthesis of IL-8 in colonic epithelial cells exposed to Gram-negative bacteria (Marin et al. 2017), whereas MAP rapidly induced macrophage-derived IL-8 (Weiss et al. 2005). Chemokine IL-8, a neutrophil factor expressed by both hematopoietic (neutrophils and macrophages) and nonhematopoietic cells, promotes rapid migration of leukocytes into an infected site and aids pathogen elimination.

The therapeutic use of cathelicidins to prevent diseases, such as Johne\u2019s disease, still remains unknown.
