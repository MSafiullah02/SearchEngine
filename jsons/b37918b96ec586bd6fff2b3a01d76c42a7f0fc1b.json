The point they raise however also illustrates, by extent, the importance of recognizing mild manifestations of neurotropism in the clinical setting, such as gustatory and olfactory impairment. This point is further exemplified in the studies of Lechien et al [2] and B\u00e9n\u00e9zit et al [3] , where hypogeusia and hyposmia were detected below at 5% retrospectively and more than 80% of the respective cohorts prospectively. In a similar manner, Moriguchi et al's [4] case report indicates that even a fulminant SARS-CoV-2 neuroinfection may escape current case definitions. Taken together, these reports point toward a needed paradigm shift in study design, in order to properly document and phenotype the extent of SARS-CoV-2's neuroinvasive potential, as well as its possible future consequences.",
