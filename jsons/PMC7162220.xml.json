            "text": "Acute viral respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are a leading cause of illness in both children and adults. Most such infections are mild and self-limiting, and are confined to the upper respiratory tract. However, in infants and children, upper respiratory tract infections may spread to the lower respiratory tract, where they can cause more severe infections and even death. The causative agents are a variety of genetically diverse viruses, including the influenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), adenoviruses, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses. It is accepted that hRSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections among children aged \u22643 years. Nevertheless, 15\u201335% of cases of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in paediatric patients are of unknown aetiology [1, 2, 3, 4], suggesting that other infectious agents may exist in the respiratory tract and remain to be identified.",

The high incidence of hRSV infections, the relatively high incidence of hMPV infections described in the literature, and the possibly severe illness associated with both viruses, emphasised the need for a reliable, sensitive and user-friendly diagnostic test for the detection of both these viruses in NPAs. Testing for the presence of both pathogens would also enable co-infections to be documented [18]. Accordingly, the present study describes the development of a real-time PCR for screening NPAs for both hRSV and hMPV. Using this assay, NPAs from paediatric patients with symptoms of ARTI were analysed in retrospective (2003\u20132004) and prospective (2004\u20132005) studies, and the effectiveness of antigen testing and the multiplex real-time PCR were compared for the detection of hRSV.",

All infants included in the study suffered from a respiratory infection and had respiratory distress. Each infant was examined by a paediatrician, and an NPA was obtained from each infant with dyspnoea and/or wheezing whose respiratory condition was sufficiently poor to require evaluation of the degree of hypoxaemia by pulse oxymetry. A decision with respect to hospitalisation or ambulatory treatment was then made on the basis of the degree of hypoxaemia and the clinical and respiratory status of each child.",

The aims of the present study were to develop and evaluate a molecular test for hRSV and hMPV, and to determine the frequency of these two viruses as causative agents of ARTI. A multiplex real-time PCR using the ABI Prism 7000 system was preferred, since this approach was already incorporated in the routine laboratory as a diagnostic tool for other infectious agents, and multiplexing reduces workloads.",

Previous reports have also suggested year-to-year variations in the frequency of hMPV [13, 21, 25]. Furthermore, the individual real-time PCR assays that have been described target a variety of regions (i.e., the N, M, L, F and P genes), implying the possibility of different performance characteristics. The primers and probe used in the present study targeted a part of the hMPV N-gene. Cote et al. [26] reported that PCR assays that amplify the N gene have superior specificities and sensitivities, and the primers and probe were adapted to cover all hMPV variants found in GenBank.",

In both years, hMPV infections could be found during the entire study period, with a slight increase in frequency from February onwards, but no significant peak in hMPV infection was detected. In contrast, the frequency of hRSV infection was higher in the winter months, with significant peaks during December 2004 and December 2005 (Table 3). Boivin et al. [20] and McAdam et al. [29] reported hMPV outbreaks in shorter periods compared with hRSV. The present study did not support this observation, as the outbreaks of hRSV and hMPV were distributed equally during both periods (Table 3). Several previous studies have documented hMPV infection during the winter and spring periods [10, 28, 29, 30, 31], but most studies published previously cover only one season, which does not allow a good definition of the seasonality of hMPV. In the present study, hRSV activity peaked in both periods during December, suggesting that this seasonal distribution is an annual occurrence [7, 29].",

[18] reported a high frequency of hMPV-positive children with severe hRSV infection, raising the possibility that hMPV might influence the severity of hRSV disease. A report from Germany, focusing on children in the intensive care unit, reported a total hMPV prevalence of 18% (n = 15); of these children, 60% were also hRSV-positive [33]. However, in the present study, only three of the 54 hMPV-positive samples were also positive for hRSV by real-time PCR, and one of these samples was positive for hMPV, hRSV and influenza A virus. In another patient, hMPV and hRSV were found 2 weeks apart (data not shown). The present study also found that the male:female ratio for hMPV-positive patients was 1:1.4 in 2003\u20132004 and 1:1.3 in 2004\u20132005. These data are in contrast to results from other studies, and to the fact that males are associated with an increased risk of respiratory tract disease caused by respiratory viruses [15, 34].",

The real-time multiplex PCR revealed a causative viral agent in an additional 160 (20.6%) specimens. hMPV was present in 9.3% (54/578) of all cases of ARTI with no other virological diagnosis. It was concluded that hRSV and hMPV are both significant causes of ARTI in children aged <5 years. These viruses co-circulate at high frequencies in winter and spring, and rapid and sensitive detection is required in order to give optimal care to patients. The fact that the real-time PCR assay is relatively rapid and is more sensitive than the hRSV antigen test makes it a valuable tool for the clinician. Further studies are needed to reveal the impact of rapid diagnosis of viral infections on clinical decision-making and antibiotic prescription patterns.",
