            "text": "Effective epidemiological surveillance is essential to ensure that the response to infectious disease outbreaks is timely and adequate. Communicable disease surveillance provides the essential information to monitor, evaluate, and model the impact of preventive and control activities; to detect and track the spread of the epidemic and emerging diseases and other threats to public health and to geographically locate communicable diseases in countries, regions, and across the globe. Integrated surveillance enables health authorities to (i) identify populations at risk, (ii) implement prevention and control strategies, (iii) detect unusual disease patterns, and (iv) contain the re-emergence or emergence of communicable diseases [1] . [3] . The current SARS-COV-2 pandemic has already claimed more than 100,000 victims and it will cause more deaths in the coming months [4] . Coronaviruses spread through human contact and also through objects contaminated by respiratory droplets exhaled by the infected persons [5] . Because of its rapid spread and high rate of infection [6] , by infecting a large proportion of the population it can cause the collapse of the health system of a country [7] . Tools that track and update the number and locations of cases are critical for surveillance of an epidemic and can help the decision-makers to fashion effective policies for controlling the spread of the disease. Although most of these epidemic dashboards use open-source data, they run on Esir ARCGIS web-services which are often expensive and hard to build and require specific knowledge on GIS-based programs. These dashboards are limited in monitoring the outbreak from a spatial epidemiological perspective, are without a time axis to track the evolution of the epidemic, and they do not allow the user to input data. To overcome these issues, we developed a new webbased tool for studying and visualizing epidemiological data, allowing the user to input data in the most convenient way for non-specialists to track outbreaks in real time and in a user-friendly manner.

It is made available in a user-friendly web site (http://outbreak.sysbio.tools/), where even nonspecialists can input data in the most convenient way. The tool tracks outbreaks in real-time, and exercises surveillance over the spread of epidemics in regions, countries or, even, across the globe. For example, we built maps and ://outbreak.sysbio.tools/animation/SARS_2003) and the evolution of the ongoing COVID-19 cases, from January 22 to March 19, 2020 (https://outbreak.sysbio.tools/animation/COVID19).",

            "text": ". The user can generate animations by hitting the \"play\" button at the bottom of the animation page (Figures 1B and 2B). It is possible to change the speed of animation and share it on social media. When the animation is displayed, two dynamic graphs are automatically generated, one that shows the number of cases per day and the other that shows the cumulative number of cases till that day. Both graphs evolveaccording to the period previously selected in the calendar. The graph boxes can be dragged and dropped to facilitate interactive map inspection. Examples of such use of the graphics of SARS 2003 and COVID-19 2020 outbreaks are shown in Figure 2C.To exercise surveillance over an outbreak, decision-makers and epidemiologists may need to explore the geographical evolution of cases over time and classify the cases by criteria such as incoming cases, ethnicity, sex, and age, among others. To make the datasets graphically clear for exploration, OUTBREAK enables the users to apply different colors for each variable of interest (Figure 3). Finally, the high-level zoom-in feature allows for deeper surveillance of an outbreak in the city of interest at different levels, such as neighborhood, street and even at a single building level(Figure 3). To demonstrate these features, we also displayed the car incidents from San Francisco Open Data Portal (https://datasf.org/opendata/) where each type of incident has a different color (https://outbreak.sysbio.tools/animation/EXAMPLE).ConclusionOUTBREAK is a web-based tool that permits easy surveillance of any epidemiological data. The high level of zoom-in enables the user to track data, at every geographical level-on a worldwide scale, at the level of a city level, a neighborhood, a street or a building. Moreover, the data can be presented graphically in real-time to easily show the daily changes in the number and the spread of cases. The tool only needs world coordinates (in decimal degrees format) and dates to generate the graphics. Besides helping in monitoring the spread of epidemics, OUTBREAK can be used to handle any type of world-wide data, such as for animal migration studies and population studies among others.",
