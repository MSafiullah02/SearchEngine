These three arrows refer to, aggressive monetary easing, flexible public spending, and a growth strategy to spark private investments. Recently, a three-action program plan titled the \"Japan Revitalization Strategy\" which is meant to increase imports and exports was announced. Therefore, Japanese imports and exports will be investigated in this chapter. This chapter also sheds light on foreign firms in Japan.",

Imports from other countries consist mostly of oil from the Middle Eastern countries (12.5 %). This steep increase compared to the previous years is a result of the closing down of atomic power plants following Great East Japan Earthquake disaster in 2011. Also Hosoe finds empirical support that due to the loss of nuclear power supply after Fukushima disaster, more fossil fuels were imported to Japan (Hosoe 2014). The Fukushima power plant accident also had a disastrous impacts on domestic manufacturing industries, which have resulted in higher costs. For example, when Kobe Steel exported steel products, it was necessary to certify that their steel was not contaminated with radiation.",

In contrast, Kansai imports from the US were merely US$ 15.9 billion and $ 18.5 billion from the EU. Already in 2001 Kansai received about half of its imports from Asian countries. That means that out of $ 82 US billion dollars of imports more than half ($ 44 US billion dollars) came from Asia. This rate increased to more than 55 % of imports in 2013.

When looking at the last 20 years of the automobile industry one can see the following pattern. In 1993 Japan's car production stood at 11 million cars; however that number decreased to around 10 million units in 2000. Since then car production has again increased to 11.6 million units in 2008. In 2009, at the time of the Lehman Shock, that number decreased sharply to 8 million units; however, since then, car production has bounced back and totaled 9.6 million units in 2013 (Fig. 3.7) . Table 3 .1 shows that car production in Japan has been relatively stable. However, it is also important to look at the worldwide production of Japanese cars including those produced in other countries. For simplicity, we will look only at the number of cars produced by Japanese automotive manufacturers in 2013. It is clearly visible that all Japanese makers shifted most of their production overseas. Toyota, for example, produced 8.94 million cars in 2013, but only 3.37 million were produced in Japan and out of this number, 1.85 million units were shipped overseas. Nissan Motors, the second biggest car manufacturer in Japan, shows a similar pattern. In 2013, Nissan Motors produced more than 5 million cars in total, but only 1 million units were produced in Japan. Out of the one million produced cars, almost half were exported to other countries.

This means that though even trade relationships with Asia are very strong, very few Asian firms operate in Japan (Fig. 3.8 ). There is evidence that the intensity of foreign headquarters' commitment towards a subsidiary depends on the degree of ownership of those subsidiaries (Bebenroth et al. 2008). Therefore, the next chart shows how strongly involved foreign affiliated firms are in their Japanese investments. It can be seen that more than 70 % of foreign affiliated firms have 100 % ownership of their Japan based affiliated firm. Put differently, only 11.1 % of the foreign affiliated firms had less than 50 % of ownership of their Japan based subsidiaries. This tendency shows clearly that the majority of the foreign firms in Japan have a rather big stake in their investment (Fig. 3.9 ).",

Evidence of a Confucian legacy can be found in gender relations, specifically between men and women, with the latter's role being predominantly weaker (Sekiguchi 2010). As we will discuss starting in Chap. 6, there is a big market for mergers and acquisitions in Japan, this development can challenge the existing institutional patterns of Japanese firms. For example that women are traditionally excluded from the core memberships of Japanese firms. By comparing five Japanese firms taken over by foreign firms, Olcott and Oliver examined the impact of foreign ownership on the role of women in the Japanese workplace (2014). Their finding is; however, that even prospects for women improved at foreign-acquired firms; however, it was not necessarily accompanied by a change in attitudes towards gender. They find that while a takeover causes some changes in a target firm, a wider societal shift would be required to significantly alter the behavior of the firms, in this case, to put women in better positions according to their abilities at foreign affiliated firms located in Japan (Olcott and Oliver 2014).",
