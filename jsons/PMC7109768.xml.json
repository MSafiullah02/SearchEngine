Biological lipids share a common amphipathic character, containing a long hydrocarbon or acyl tail, that is distinctively hydrophobic, and a hydrophilic head group, which may possess a net charge. This amphipathic nature allows for a thermodynamically efficient spontaneous formation of a bilayer driven by the hydrophobic effect within a predominantly aqueous environment.8 The inability of the nonpolar hydrocarbon chains to form hydrogen bonds with water contributes to the orientation of the hydrophobic tail away from water molecules, a process that is associated with an entropic term. The entropy S term defines the disorder of a system and is connected to the free energy change \u0394G, the absolute temperature T and the enthalpy change \u0394H according to Eq. (1). (1)\u0394G=\u0394H\u2212T\u0394SThe lack of hydrogen bonds between the hydrophobic lipid tails and water would impose a cage-like ordering of water molecules around the hydrophobic parts of lipids, which would cause a decrease in \u0394S of water (i.e., \u0394S would become negative) and thus lead to a positive and thermodynamically unfavorable \u0394G. In order to minimize contact with water and thus the entropic decrease, the hydrocarbon chains self-assemble and orient away from the aqueous medium. This effect is known as the hydrophobic effect and constitutes the fundamental mechanism governing the formation of lipid membrane structures. In this orientation the polar head groups interact with water molecules and other polar head groups that together form the contact area with the aqueous environment. This picture of membrane lipid assembly represents a highly simplified illustration of the membrane structure, with structural properties of different lipid types. An overview of the different types of membrane lipids found in biological membranes is presented in Fig. 2\n.",

Like the name suggests, the head group of GPLs contains a phosphate and a glycerol group. The phosphate group is esterified at the sn-3 position of glycerol, whereas the fatty acid (or acyl) chains are esterified at sn-1 and sn-2 positions of the glycerol thus forming the hydrophobic region of the membrane (Fig. 2A). Usually, GPLs bear a total of one, two, or four fatty acid chains, with each chain containing between 12 and 24 carbons and sometimes featuring up to six double bonds. For instance, palmitic acid, an hexadecanoic acid that exhibits 16 carbons and no double bonds (DB), codified as 16:0 to represent the N\ncarbons:N\nDB ratio, whereas oleic acid has 18 carbon atoms and one double bond at the carbon atom 9 (i.e., octadecenoic acid) and is therefore labeled as 18:1\u03949 or 18:1\u03c99. Unsaturated fatty acids in cis conformation introduce kinks in the chain and cause voids in the hydrophobic part of the membrane (packing defects) with the result that the bilayer is more fluid and flexible. In Table 1\nthe common fatty acids found in biological membranes are listed.9\n",

Here, the number following the omega characterizes the position of the first double bond with respect to the terminal methyl group in the chemical structure. For example, in the (\u03c93)-PUFAs the first unsaturation bond appears at the third carbon atom from the end of the acyl chain. For humans, linoleic (18:2\u03c96, LA) and \u03b1-linolenic acid (18:3\u03c93, ALA) belong to the essential PUFAs, which have to be obtained via food like seeds, nuts, and oils and from which longer PUFAs like arachidonic (20:4\u03c96, ARA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6\u03c93, DHA) can be synthesized. However, the biosynthesis of DHA from ALA is rather endogenous and so limited in humans to a maximum of 4%,10 thus, DHA is mainly derived from food like fish oil. Many of the PUFAs are located in biological membranes. For instance, DHA is contained in the retina and in brain membranes, where it has a modulation function on membrane proteins, the transport of choline, glycine, and taurine, as well as on the response of rhodopsin11 (see Section 4.2.1 for a case study, in which DHA is involved in Alzheimer's disease).",

As a consequence, different combinations of the head group structures and acyl chains can lead to different polymorphic shapes of lipids (Fig. 3\n). In the crystalline liquid state (lamellar phase or L\n\u03b1, Fig. 3A), biological membranes adopt the shape of a lipid bilayer, which enhances mobility of the membrane components and passive permeability for water and other small molecules. In this phase, the acyl chains can exist in the all-trans or one of the two gauche conformations. The latter causes a kink in the acyl chain and thus generates space in the hydrophobic bilayer region, increasing its passive permeability. In contrast, the nonnative ordered gel phase of a lipid bilayer (L\n\u03b2) forms when most of the acyl chains adopt the very rigid all-trans state. Generally, GPLs contain an unsaturated fatty acid with one or two double bonds at the sn-2 and a saturated or monounsaturated fatty acid at the sn-1 position of glycerol.12, 13 GPLs with only one acyl chain at the sn-1 position are called lysophospholipids and act as signaling molecules for the activation of membrane proteins. They are also involved in the generation of micellar structures, in which the polar head groups orient to the water phase and the acyl chains associate in the core (Fig. 3B).",

            "text": "The classification of GPLs is based on the head groups and the fatty acid content. The simplest GPL is phosphatidic acid (PA), which is negatively charged at physiological pH and exists as an intermediate during the biosynthesis of other lipids. It is generally not highly present in biological membranes. Mammalian cell membranes are mostly populated by GPLs with phosphatidylcholine (PC) head groups, in which the phosphate is connected with the alcohol choline. Interestingly, PCs are almost absent in prokaryotic cells. Under physiological conditions, PC is zwitterionic (+N(CH3)3, PO4\u2212) with a zero net charge. Zwitterionic phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) are found in all cell membranes, but in higher quantities in prokaryotic cells. In contrast, they are almost restricted to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (cytosolic side) in eukaryotes. The polar group of PE (+NH3, PO4\u2212) displays stronger intramolecular interactions than PC and is more nonpolar in the aqueous phase, with the result that an hexagonal H\nII arrangement (Fig. 3C) is more stable in an inverted orientation than in a micelle. In the inverted orientation, the polar PE groups are oriented toward the core region, whereas the acyl chains are extended outwards into the surrounding water. PE is the major GPL class in bacteria cell membranes together with phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and cardiolipin (CL or diphosphatidylglycerol). While the head group of PS is negatively charged (+NH3, PO4\u2212, COO\u2212) and is mostly located in the inner leaflet of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, PG (also negatively charged) and CL (four fatty acid chains, twice negatively charged) have only been found in mitochondrial membranes of eukaryotes and in most of the bacterial plasma membranes. The localization of CL to mitochondria suggests the evolutionary fusion of prokaryotes, as endosymbionts, with eukaryotic cells in the past. Phosphatidylinositols (PI) represent another class of GPLs that have been found to be involved with lipid and cell signaling, as well as regulation of membrane proteins and membrane trafficking.14, 15 PIs show a high diversity in the head group structure, especially since the hydroxyl groups of inositol can be phosphorylated at positions 3, 4, and 5 to generate any of three PI monophosphates (PI(3)P, PI(4)P, PI(5)P), three bisphosphates (PI(3,4)P2, PI(3,5)P2, PI(4,5)P2), or one triphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3).

Cholesterol, also abbreviated as CHOL, is the major component in mammalian cells, which are not able to grow without cholesterol.9 The chemical structure of cholesterol (Fig. 2B) consists of four fused rings with a double bond in ring B, a hydrocarbon chain at ring D, and a polar hydroxyl group at ring A, leading to a planar conformation with an amphipathic character. The hydroxyl group interacts with the polar head group of GPLs and sphingolipids and is orientated to the water side, whereas the planar ring system and the hydrocarbon chain are in contact with the acyl chains. Interestingly, although ergosterol from yeast shares a very similar structure with cholesterol, they cannot replace each other.9 The fundamental role of cholesterol is the maintaining and controlling the membrane fluidity by increasing the membrane packing and thickness. Thus, cholesterol decreases the packing defects in the hydrophobic part and encourages the all-trans conformation in GPLs, which leads to a decrease of the membrane permeability for ions and small molecules.9 Furthermore, cholesterol modulates membrane proteins in special conformations by decreasing the free volume in the membrane and mostly inhibits these proteins or can directly bind membrane proteins. Moreover, cholesterol can cause lateral membrane phase separation between cholesterol enriched and poor regions in order to regulate membrane proteins. The concept of lipid rafts will discussed later in this chapter (see Section 1.3).",

Like PC, SM is able to form bilayers in aqueous environment and interacts with cholesterol to build lipid rafts20, 21 (see Section 1.3).

Membrane lipids can influence membrane proteins via direct binding that allosterically affects the conformational preferences. Furthermore, membrane proteins can exhibit posttranslational modifications in form of sugars and GPLs, as seen for instance in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, which have functional roles in membrane protein transport, cell adhesion, cell wall synthesis, and cell surface protection.

Within the past few years, the theory of lipid rafts developed by Simons and Ikonen has become established29 and involves the accumulation of less flexible lipids for the building of ordered nanodomains, called rafts (Lo, <200 nm, especially via cholesterol, PC and SM), which are surrounded by disordered and more fluid lipid areas (Ld, polyunsaturated acyl chains). This activates membrane proteins in terms of conformational changes or oligomerization. Cholesterol has been observed to play a key role as at concentrations below 10 mol% of cholesterol no domain separation was reported between the phases. This was demonstrated for ternary membrane systems using in vitro methods and in both synthetic giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) and giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs)30, 31 extracted from cells, as well as via MD simulations.32, 33 Until now, no experimental technique is available to visualize the process of raft formation in living cells since conventional optical microscopy is limited to a resolution of \u223c250 nm.

When the hydrophobic part of a TM protein is too small to match the hydrophobic bilayer thickness, again this might result in protein aggregation or changes to its orientation or conformation.

Thus, this complexity constitutes a unique kind of challenge for structural study. While experimental methods can be used to detect protein\u2013lipid interactions, unraveling structural mechanisms at the atomistic level often remains problematic. Many membrane proteins are involved in disease pathologies (e.g., cystic fibrosis, Parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and cancer) and to properly understand the molecular events associated with such disease states, their structural dynamics needs to be resolved. For drug development purposes, there is also continual need to investigate protein\u2013lipid interactions.40 For atomistic insight into protein\u2013lipid interactions, experimental techniques like X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) are often used. X-ray structures in the 1\u20133 \u00c5 resolution range represent an often dynamic system with single snapshots and the crystallization process sometimes involves harsh treatments capable of generating nonnative protein conformations. Furthermore, flexible regions (e.g., loops) cannot be detected by X-ray crystallography. On the other hand, NMR can describe protein dynamics but it is limited to small protein systems of \u223c50 kDa. Cryo-EM has in recent years become an important tool for investigating protein\u2013lipid association in membranes systems with a resolution of 2\u20134 \u00c5.41 Every resolved protein structure is available in the RCBS Protein Data Bank (PDB)42, 43 (https://www.rcsb.org), while the orientation of membrane proteins in biological membranes is provided by the Orientations of Proteins in Membranes (OPM) database44 (https://opm.phar.umich.edu/).",

The history of lipid bilayers studied by MD simulations with no explicit water molecules began in the 1980s with investigations of few lipid molecules.45, 46, 47 After about a decade, MD simulations were successfully employed in the study of increasingly complex and more realistic lipid bilayers, including PCs and PSs with explicit solvents,48, 49, 50, 51, 52 and including embedded proteins.53, 54, 55, 56 These initial studies, however, were limited to conformational sampling on the picosecond timescale. Following the developments in hardware and software, MD simulation have increasingly begun to capture the structural dynamics of larger macromolecular systems, like ribosomes,57 protein\u2013membrane systems (e.g., transporters and channels),58, 59 virus membranes,60 and lipid rafts.32, 33 By overcoming the resolution limits of the experimental methods and exploring the fine molecular details of macromolecular events, MD simulations can now serve as molecular microscope\n35, 61 to investigate lipid\u2013lipid and protein\u2013lipid interactions of more realistic cell membranes on submillisecond timescale (Fig. 5A\n). Different MD simulation techniques apart from traditional all-atom (AA) models have been developed for this purpose. These include coarse-grained (CG) force fields,62, 63 the highly mobile membrane mimetic (HMMM) model,64 and multiscale models (Fig. 5B). To decrease the calculation time during the MD simulation, CG models represent multiple atom groups as fewer pseudoparticles (so-called beads), while the HMMM model employs a membrane core of organic solvent combined with truncated lipids for the head group region for increasing the lateral diffusion of membrane lipids. However, these approaches imply a loss in resolution such that in CG model small protein conformation changes cannot be captured, while the HMMM model is restricted to modeling peripheral protein\u2013membranes systems.64 Multiscale methods comprise the use of different levels of representation in performing MD simulations, e.g., starting with CG simulations to extract different large-scale conformations, which are then converted to atomistic structure to study at a better resolution.65\n",

The parameters needed for the definition of U(r\nN) are derived from either quantum mechanical (QM) calculations or spectroscopic data. Eqs.

The bond lengths, angles, and improper torsion angles are often described by harmonic potentials, and for this reason, and unlike to QM descriptions, bond cleavage is not possible in classical MD simulations. With harmonic potentials even small deviations from the equilibrium values (r\nij,0, \u03b8\nijk,0, \u03a6ijkl,0) can cause considerable increases in the energy of the system, which also depend on the force constants (k\nij, k\nijk, k\nijkl). To model the rotation around bonds in accordance with thermodynamic data, a cosine function of the dihedral angle is typically used, where V\nn is the force constant belonging to the torsion, \u03a6ijkl,0 is the angle where the potential passes through its minimum value, and n is the multiplicity, which indicates the number of minima as the bond is rotated through 360 degrees.",

The attractive term of the LJ potential r\u22126 represents the component of the interactions based on London dispersion forces originating from induced dipole\u2013dipole interactions. The repulsive term r\u221212 derives from the overlap of electron orbitals and describes the Pauli repulsion at short ranges, which can be efficiently calculated by squaring the attractive term. For each combination of atoms i and j, the well depth \u025b\nij and collision diameter \u03c3\nij are required for the calculation of the LJ potential, in addition to the interatomic distance r\nij. The last important contribution to a FF is the electrostatic interaction between atoms, which is calculated using a Coulomb potential that depends on the distance r\nij and the partial charges of the atoms q\ni and q\nj as well as contains the permittivity of vacuum \u025b\n0. With Eqs. (3) and (4), electrons are not explicitly considered. The atomic partial charges are derived from the electron distribution in a molecule as determined by QM calculations. In this approximation, the continuous function of the electron density becomes distributed point charges. Moreover, the partial charges, which are dependent on molecular conformations, are usually also fixed in most of the FFs. The interested reader is referred to chapter \u201cPairwise-additive and polarizable atomistic force fields for molecular dynamics simulations of proteins\u201d by Lemkul of this book, which provides a more detailed discussion of classical FFs, including polarizable FFs that go beyond the fixed-charge approximation. In most MD simulations employing periodic boundary conditions, the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method94, 95 is employed for treating the sum over electrostatic interactions, which are long-range interactions and thus require special care in periodic systems. In this method, the electrostatics interactions are divided into two parts: (1) a short-range contribution and (2) a long-range contribution. While the short-range contribution is calculated in real space in combination with a cutoff value (0.8\u20131.2 nm), the long-range contribution is computed using a Fourier transformation. This approach guarantees rapid convergence of the electrostatic energy calculation as compared with that of a direct summation.",

It is related to the degree of fluidity of the membrane in a certain phase and, at the same time, a good indicator for whether equilibrium of an MD simulation has been reached. This common membrane parameter can be experimentally determined using X-ray or neutron scattering factors, volumetric methods, as well as NMR spectroscopy. From MD simulations, it can be calculated with Eq. (5): (5)AL[nm2]=BxBynHere, the lateral dimensions B\nx and B\ny of the simulation box (unit cell) are along the x- and y-axes, respectively, while n is the number of lipids per leaflet. However, this equation can only be used for homogeneous membranes with one lipid species. In the case of mixed bilayers, the membrane area must be partitioned into segments, for example by using two-dimensional Voronoi tessellation100, 101 or grid-based methods based on atomic vdW radii,99, 102 where the size difference between the different lipids and sterols are taken into account. A\nL is tightly related to other membrane properties, like acyl chain ordering, compressibility, and molecular packaging. The time-average of A\nL can be used to judge the equilibrium state of a bilayer during an MD simulation. An equilibrated bilayer shows only small fluctuations around an average value of A\nL. However, this can only be assessed if the MD simulation is conducted in the NpT ensemble where the simulation box dimensions are allowed to fluctuate. In this ensemble, the number of molecules N, the pressure p, and the temperature T are constant, which is a more realistic ensemble than the NVT ensemble (where the volume V is kept constant) for comparison to experiments.98 A higher value of A\nL corresponds to a more disordered state, whereas low A\nL values reflect highly packed lipids in the membrane. The probability distribution p(A\nL) for the area per lipid molecule can also be calculated (see Fig. 6B for an example distribution), allowing to determine the minimum, maximum and average values of A\nL, which can be important for processes such as lateral diffusion.98\n",

Moreover, the determination of A\nL is affected by thermal fluctuations in the lateral and transverse directions of lipid bilayers. In the last decades, it occurred that different A\nL values for the same kind of bilayer were obtained with the same experimental technique or calculated by the same researcher group. Nevertheless, A\nL determined from simulation studies using the same FF usually result in very similar values as opposed to those derived from experiments, which can be explained by the fact that the FFs were parameterized to produce a certain A\nL value (see Table 1 in Ref. 96). It should further be considered that undulations or fluctuations in the lipid bilayer structure, which may result from insufficient sampling or from simulations artifacts (e.g., due to finite system size or periodic boundary conditions) may also cause uncertainties in A\nL. As a consequence, A\nL alone is not sufficient to evaluate the quality of a lipid FF or to assess the degree of fluidity of a lipid bilayer; it should be considered together with the electron density profile across the bilayer and the bilayer thickness for judging the phase state of a membrane.",

            "text": "While A\nL facilitates information about the lateral structure of a lipid bilayer, the membrane thickness provides information on the orthogonal direction (Fig. 6C). Generally, the membrane thickness is in the range of 3\u20135 nm. There are three slightly different quantities commonly used to represent the thickness of a membrane: (1) the head-to-head thickness (D\nHH) derived from the distance between the averaged z-positions of the phosphorus atoms of opposing leaflets, (2) the bilayer thickness obtained from the water density probability at half-maximum (D\nB), and (3) the hydrophobic thickness (2D\nC) calculated from the half-maximum of the density of the atoms in the hydrophobic acyl chains. The quantity D\nHH can be determined by X-ray scattering as the distance between the two maxima of the electron density profile of the lipid bilayer (see Fig. 6D). With this approach, the accuracy of D\nHH is limited by the Fourier truncation error. For measuring D\nB, neutron scattering experiments can be applied by making use of the high contrast between the protiated lipid and deuterated water accurately defining the bilayer thickness, which is correlated to the penetration of the lipid bilayer by water molecules. Both D\nHH and D\nB can be easily determined from MD simulations. D\nHH is usually computed as the average distance between the phosphate planes of the two leaflets. D\nB is calculated using Eq. (6) (with the bilayer normal in z-direction and d being the simulation box length in that direction) as the distance between the points along the membrane normal, where the water density probability p\nw(z) is one half: (6)DB[nm]=d\u2212\u222b\u2212d/2d/2pw(z)dzThe third measure for the membrane thickness, 2D\nC, refers to the thickness of the hydrophobic core of a bilayer96 and is determined based on the positions of the CH2 groups in each leaflet of a lipid bilayer. These positions can be derived from X-ray or neutron scattering data, or from NMR making use of the carbon-deuterium bond order parameters in the acyl chain. However, 2D\nC is highly dependent on the underlying approximations (e.g., for the volume of a methylene group or the estimate for the average tilt of the acyl chains with respect to the bilayer normal), thus the outcomes can significantly differ and are only comparable to the values determined from MD simulations as long as the same assumptions are employed.96 Together with A\nL, the membrane thickness allows one to assess the state the bilayer in question. In fact, a decrease in A\nL almost always relates to an increase in the lipid bilayer thickness, which is further accompanied by a stronger ordering of the acyl chains in the membrane.",

With the help of X-ray crystallography, the electron density of a membrane can be experimentally estimated. In MD simulations, where electrons are not explicitly considered, the time-averaged positions of electrons can be inferred with good accuracy from the atomic positions. Fig. 6D shows a typical electron density profile across a membrane, which is characterized by following observations: The profile exhibits a global minimum in the middle of the bilayer (near the terminal CH3 groups of the acyl chains), two maxima corresponding to the positions of the head groups (phosphate groups) in each leaflet, and a local minimum reflecting the water layer outside the membrane. The thickness D\nHH is defined as the distance between the two maxima of the electron density profile, which changes upon the insertion or interaction of a molecule with a membrane. In the case of mixed membranes involving cholesterol, the peaks of the phosphate groups are slightly shifted depending on the cholesterol concentration, whereas the rest of the profile exhibits no significant changes.98 The electron density profile is symmetric if the two leaflets have the same composition and when the bilayer is in its equilibrium state. The main aspects of an electron density profile are required to be reproduced by a FF, like the overall profile shape and the position of the peaks corresponding to specific groups of atoms (e.g., head groups, glycerols, carbonyls, methylenes in the hydrocarbon chains). In addition, these profiles can be also calculated from the mass density across the bilayer, which shows how the mass is distributed along the membrane z-axis and exhibits the same shape as the electron density distribution. In the case of a typical hydrated membrane system, the mass density is high at the beginning of the lipid chain, similar to the mass density of several soft polymers (0.9\u20131.3 g cm\u22123). At carbon position 9, the density is reduced to the one of liquid hexadecane (0.753 g cm\u22123) and it is considerably lower in the middle of the membrane (0.60 g cm\u22123). This shows that the acyl chain region of the bilayer in the liquid crystalline phase is far from being homogeneous.",

Experimentally, the measurement of the carbon\u2013deuterium (or hydrogen) bond order parameters S\nCD (S\nCH) can be accomplished by NMR spectroscopy using 2H (deuterium, D) selectively labeled lipids. More recently also 1H\u201313C labeled lipids have been employed. The order parameters S\nCD depend on a combination of local, molecular, and collective motions as well as static disorder, and the decomposition the overall value into individual contributions is difficult. 2H NMR spectroscopy has been widely applied to determine the S\nCD values of the acyl chains of GPLs, which have become an important target property to validate lipid FFs. The order parameter S\nCD of a C\u2013D bond of an acyl chain measured by NMR can be directly compared with values for S\nCH calculated from a simulation using the following equation: (7)SCH=12\u30083cos2(\u03b8z)\u22121\u3009Here, \u03b8\nz is the (time dependent) angle between the C\u2013H bond vector and the bilayer normal (experimentally the magnetic field or z-axis of the simulation box). The angular brackets denote a time and ensemble average. The order parameter adopts values between \u22120.5 and 1, where a value of \u22120.5 means that the two vectors are perpendicular to each other, while a value of 1 implies that the two vectors are parallel. The order parameters do not only depend on the orientation, but also (dis)order of the system. For instance, S\nCH = 0 can either arise from C\u2013H bonds isotropically disordered with respect to the bilayer normal, or all corresponding bond vectors are perfectly oriented at the magic angle relative to the bilayer normal (that is 54.7 degrees, corresponding to cos2(\u03b8\nz) = 1/3).",

It is characterized by some degree of disorder in the alkyl groups close to the water interface, which is followed by an increase in order with a order maximum at about the middle of the acyl chains. Toward the center of the membrane, corresponding to increasing C atom number positions along the acyl chain, the disorder increases (i.e., decreasing S\nCH). This results from the greater degree of conformational flexibility of the acyl chains in the core region of a membrane. Furthermore, the length of an acyl chain influences the S\nCD values, with longer chains reducing the order parameter. Similarly, temperature affects S\nCH, with lower temperatures implying an increase in S\nCH due to the closer packing of the lipids.",

The experimental techniques for determining lateral diffusion constants range from fluorescence techniques (e.g., FRAP, FRET and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, FCS) to EPR and NMR spectroscopy (e.g., 1H, 2H, 19F, and 31P). As for other membrane observables, the resulting values for the lateral diffusion constants can vary even of one uses the same method, as it is sensitive to experimental conditions, like the temperature, hydration content, pH, ionic strength and experimental setup.96 Furthermore, EPR and fluorescence methods have to use labeling molecules (e.g., spin labels or fluorophores) for tracking the lipid diffusion. Here, the measured lateral diffusion coefficient derives from the labeling molecules instead from the lipid itself, which is not negligible in some cases depending on the type of labeling, its concentration, and whether the measurement was done in a bilayer or monolayer.96 Neutron scattering can be used for fast, short-range diffusion (motions for 0.1\u201310 nm in <1 ns), while the other techniques sample slower, medium-to-long-range diffusion processes (motions of >0.1 \u03bcm on the ns-to-ms timescale).106\n",

            "text": "The CHARMM (Chemistry at Harvard Macromolecular Mechanics) all-atom force field originates from the lab of Martin Karplus at Harvard University and has an active community who developed a huge set of FFs with a focus on biomolecules, such as lipids,72, 73 carbohydrates,107, 108, 109, 110 nucleic acids,111, 112 and proteins.113, 114 Additionally, a general force field, known as the CHARMM General FF (CGenFF)115 allows simulations with other biomolecules and drugs that conform to the general parameterization scheme applied in CHARMM. In addition to the common FF terms (see Eqs. 3 and 4), the intramolecular interactions include the so-called Urey\u2013Bradley term for covalent angles, which is a cross term connecting the motions of bond angles and lengths: (10)U(r,\u03b8)=kub,i(i+2)ri(i+2)\u2212ri(i+2),02\ufe38Urey\u2013BradleyThe Urey\u2013Bradley term with force constant k\nub,i(i+2) applies to atoms i and i + 2 connected by two bonds. However, this term is only used for older CHARMM parameters but not for newer ones. The parameterization strategy of CHARMM is based on fitting to reproduce experimental and ab initio QM data at the HF/6-31(g) level of theory of small model compounds (e.g., alkanes for the acyl chain) that are transferable to larger molecules (e.g., to lipids) with some further optimization. Furthermore, it is recommended to use the modified TIP3P water model\u2014even though better water models like TIP4P are available\u2014when employing the CHARMM pairwise additive FF,97 since the parameters for interaction of biomolecules with water were optimized for this water model and the usage of another water model could lead to imbalances in the electrostatic and solvation energies. Another peculiarity of CHARMM is that this FF applies force-based cutoffs in which the force is smoothed to zero at a cutoff of 1\u20131.2 nm, affecting the overall potential. Therefore, this cutoff value must be used when using CHARMM. Moreover, the nonbonded interactions of atoms that are separated by four bonds, so-called 1\u20134 interactions are not scaled, which in turn implies that the dihedral potential parameters depend on the electrostatic and the LJ parameters. Thus, optimization of these coupled parameters is typically carried out in an iterative fashion, in which the dihedral parameters are fitted to the obtained LJ and electrostatics parameters per iteration step.",

They were updated with the release of the CHARMM27 parameter set (C27),69 which was the first widely available and thus used AA-FF for lipids. For a DPPC lipid bilayer C27 produced a good agreement with experimental deuterium NMR order parameters (S\nCD) for the acyl chains and the electron density profiles.69 However, further investigations revealed nonnegligible disagreements with experiment (e.g., for the A\nL value)116 as well as for dynamical properties obtained from NMR relaxation times, indicating that probably the C27 torsional barriers were too high.117 For fully saturated lipids it was shown that the bilayers often exhibited a gel phase at conditions corresponding to liquid crystalline phases. To circumvent this problem, many MD simulations with C27 were performed in the NV T ensemble118 with a fixed A\nL value or under nonzero surface tension,119 as under these conditions the trans conformation of the acyl chains is more preferred than the gauche conformations.120 There was an update to the C27 parameter set70, 71 (called C27r), but the phase state problem of the lipid bilayers was still present and also the correct A\nL could not be reproduced with MD simulations at zero surface tension (NpT ensemble).70, 121\n",

Partial atom charges and torsion potentials were reparameterized by using ab initio computations, as well as revision of some LJ parameters for matching with semiempirical QM results of small bilayer assemblies, solvation free energies, and S\nCD near the membrane interfacial region. Moreover, the description of the lipid head group structure and dynamics was improved in the same manner like as in the work by Sonne et al.122 and compared to NMR data. Properties as average A\nL at zero tension (\u03b3 = 0), structure factors, dipole electrostatic potential indicated good agreement with experiment and better than with the C27r parameter set.73 The key improvement was that the C36 lipid FF accurately matched the X-ray and neutron form factors, bilayer and hydrocarbon thickness as well as S\nCD of POPC and POPE bilayers. To sum up, the C36 FF allows to accurately represent bilayer properties of fully saturated and monounsaturated lipid molecules in the NpT ensemble.73 In the last years, different kind of lipids were added to C36 using the same parameter strategy, such as a variety of acyl chains (PUFAs,123 branched124 chains and chains with cyclic moieties125) and head groups (PA, PG, PI, and PS),72, 126, 127 sterols (cholesterol,128 ergosterol129 and plant sterols130), sphingolipids131 and ceramides132 as well as glycolipids133 and LPS126, 134 making use of the CHARMM carbohydrate FF.",

MD simulations of DMPC, DPPC, POPC, DOPC, and DMPC/CHOL bilayers produced good values for the A\nL, X-ray and neutron form factors, and acyl chain order parameters S\nCD.74 However, the Klauda lab reported general issues (unpublished data) with too high values for the density of alkanes and too small values for the hydrophobic bilayer thickness; furthermore the head groups needed additional parameterization.97\n",

            "text": "For a long time, no proper parameters for lipids were available for the AMBER FF (Assisted Model Building and Energy Refinement), although some attempts were done to simulate bilayers. However, the A\nL values for DMPC and DOPC bilayers modeled with the Generalized Amber Force Field (GAFF)135 with the extension to lipids75 were underestimated76 compared to the experimental values. A certain surface tension had to be applied to obtain the correct lipid area. In contrast to CHARMM, in AMBER the 1\u20134 LJ and Coulomb interactions are scaled by a factor of 0.833; moreover, the restricted electrostatic potential (RESP) method136, 137 is used for the calculation of the partial charges of whole molecules. With the goal to develop a lipid FF that is comparable to C36 FF, the Lipid11 FF77 was developed, in which a careful reparameterization of LJ and charge values to improve modeling of lipid bilayers was undertaken. Bilayers of DOPC, POPE, and POPC were tested, but again a surface tension term had to be applied to obtain good agreement with experimental scattering profiles and NMR S\nCD data. In an alternative approach, modifications to the GAFF LJ parameters for the simulation of acyl chains were made to generate accurate and stable simulations of pure lipid bilayers of DLPC, DMPC, DPPC, DOPC, POPC, and POPE, yielding the GAFFlipid FF.138 For all six lipid types tested it achieved a higher level of agreement between simulation and experiment for numerous structural properties, like A\nL, volume per lipid, bilayer thickness, order parameter, and head group hydration. Based on the GAFFlipid parameters, the Lipid11 FF was updated yielding the current standard AMBER lipid FF, named Lipid14,78 which allows the simulation of a number of lipids without an additional surface tension term. As for C36, the Lipid14 FF has been tested by simulating bilayers of six different lipid types (DLPC, DMPC, DPPC, DOPC, POPC, and POPE) and no longer requires a surface tension to be applied for keeping the lipid area constant. Membrane properties, such as A\nL, isothermal compressibility, bilayer thickness, and NMR S\nCD parameters, favorably agree with experiment, reaching the same level of accuracy as C36. The only shortcoming is that S\nCD for the head group and order splitting for carbon-2 on the sn-2 chain were not tested. Lipid14, which works well with the tensionless NpT ensemble, can be combined with the AMBER FFs for proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates,139 and small molecules, and was extended to mixed membranes including cholesterol.140 There is also an update to the Lipid17 FF for anionic head groups and polyunsaturated acyl chains141; however, it has not been applied yet, leaving it open how well it performs.",

            "text": "Around the same time when the C27r FF was updated to the C36 FF and based on the suggestions in these papers,120, 122 a new AA-FF named Slipids (Stockholm lipids) for fully saturated phospholipids142 and monounsaturated lipids79 was published, which was extended a year later to include the lipid head groups PG, PE, PS, and SM as well as cholesterol.80 As starting point the recent C36 parameter set was used and following optimizations performed: (1) The partial charges, LJ and torsion angle parameters of all lipid tails were updated by using high-level ab initio calculations, whereas the parameters for covalent bonds and angles along with some of the torsion angle and LJ parameters were used from C36. (2) The head group parameters were improved using QM calculations at a low level of theory and the water dielectric constant readjusted using the TIP3P water model. (3) Scaling factors for the LJ/Coulomb parameters for the 1\u20134 interactions were introduced, using a value of 0.5 between hydrogens of the lipid carbon chain and varying values for the rest, which is based on AMBER FFs with a scaling factor of 0.833. (4) The RESP method136, 137 was applied to determine the partial charges, as done for the AMBER parameters. For testing, the resulting Slipids FF was applied to DLPC, DMPC, DPPC, POPC, SOPC, POPE, and DOPE bilayers79, 142 as well as to mixed membranes with cholesterol.80 A good agreement to the experimental values of many membrane observables, like A\nL, NMR order parameters and structure factors was obtained. The most important aspect is that the parameters are able to reproduce structural properties of single and double component membranes without employing a surface tension, therefore, it allows to study complex systems containing many different lipids and proteins in a fully atomistic resolution in the NpT ensemble. Due to the parameterization close to the AMBER strategy, it is compatible with the AMBER FFs for proteins, which was tested for a WALP23 peptide (modeled by three versions of the AMBER protein FF),79 and for drug-related compounds in combination with lipid bilayers.143, 144\n",

The partial charges were obtained with the similar route as followed for AMBER FFs and the optimization of dihedral angles was accomplished as for the C36 lipid FF, using small molecules to represent the PC lipid head groups. Only a single 200 ns MD simulation of a DPPC bilayer at 323 K was performed for the parameterization that showed good agreement with experimental S\nCD and X-ray form factors.83 Furthermore, the inclusion of the dihedral optimization for the lipid head groups reproduced similar values as NMR spectroscopy for this region of the lipid. Since then, the OPLS-AA FF was extended to lipids with chain unsaturation,150 cholesterol,151 ether linkages,152 PE,152,152a PI,152b PS, and SM152a with different saturation/unsaturation levels and acyl tail lengths as well as GM1.152c Apart from these, POPC oxidized lipids such as 1-palmitoyl-2-(9\u2032-oxo-nonanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PoxnoPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-azelaoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PazePC) were also paramterized for study with OPLS-AA FF.152d However, further developments are necessary to obtain the lipid diversity available in C36 and the AMBER FFs. There is also an OPLS-UA FF, which was initially developed for DMPC and resulted in good agreement with the experimental value of A\nL at 303 K.81 It was extended to cholesterol82 and epicholesterol,153 but lacks further lipids necessary to simulate more realistic biological membranes.",

            "text": "(Groningen molecular simulation package)86 uses the UA approach to represent each nonpolar CH, CH2, and CH3 group of hydrocarbons as a single particle, thus reaching an about threefold acceleration in comparison to AA FFs. The main objective in the development of GROMOS FFs is the reproduction of thermodynamic properties of model compounds (small molecules representing biomolecular fragments), like enthalpies and free energies of solvation in polar and apolar environments. Therefore it became a popular choice for the simulation of membrane proteins. GROMOS FFs applied for bilayer simulations can be split into two groups: (1) using the original GROMOS nonbonded parameters (e.g., 45A3,86 G53A,87 and G54A154 parameter sets) and (2) the Berger modification84 (also called Berger lipid FF), in which the Ryckaert\u2013Bellemans potential was implemented for describing torsion rotations of the hydrocarbon chains of lipids. Several studies with the 45A3 parameter set (e.g., DPPC)86 and Berger lipids (e.g., DOPC and DMPC)116, 119, 155, 156 revealed that the GROMOS FF did not properly reproduce a number of experimental properties, like the electron density profile, structure factor, and A\nL. Moreover, with GROMOS, MD simulations cannot produce the proper gel phase of bilayers at temperatures below the melting point.157 Based on further ab initio computations and fitting to thermodynamical data for liquid alkanes, the 43A1-S3 parameter set158 showed better results for A\nL than the previous versions and was updated to the G53A6 parameter set,87 which exhibited very good agreement with experimental membrane properties of DPPC bilayers (A\nL and volume per lipid, electron density profiles, bilayer thickness and hydration, S\nCD of acyl chains). Furthermore, it reproduces the structural and hydration values of common GPLs of varying length and degree of unsaturation of the acyl chains (e.g., DLPC, DMPC, DOPC, and POPC) in a liquid crystal phase.159 In addition, the G53A6 parameter set can be applied for the MD simulation of PC bilayers in the liquid crystalline phase. The G53A6 FF was further improved with the Kukol parameters88 and the parameters by Piggot89 (known as the CKP parameter set) for saturated and unsaturated PC and PG lipids and later also for PG, PE, and CL.90 Although it is known that the Berger parameters are not the best choice for reproduction of experimental lipid properties, they are still used in many recent papers in combination with older versions of the GROMOS FF or AMBER FFs. Finally, the last update is the G54A7 parameter set for a number of lipid types.91 In addition to the G53A6 FF, the G54A7 parameters include bacterial lipids with branched fatty acids in their lipid chains,160 with cyclopropane moieties,161 as well as hopanoids and sterols.162 However, the number of different lipids that has been tested for this FF is rather limited.",

It would require at least orders of magnitude greater sampling to reach diffusive equilibration. A workaround to this problem was presented by Ohkubo et al. with the development of the HMMM model,64 which uses an organic solvent layer to describe the hydrophobic core of the membrane while maintaining an atomic description of the lipid head groups and shortened GPL acyl tails. This leads to an acceleration of the lipid diffusion without sacrificing the atomistic level of detail for the head groups, which are essential for protein\u2013membrane interactions. In the HMMM model, the GPLs are truncated in the acyl chains. The resulting space in the membrane core is then filled with an organic solvent, most often 1,1-dichloroethane (DCLE) to reproduce the characteristics of the hydrophobic core of lipid bilayer (Fig. 5B, left panel).",

            "text": "In the original HMMM model study,64 the authors demonstrated the efficiency and robustness of their approach. They used the CHARMM36 General FF parameters115 to perform the simulations. First, they demonstrated that the HMMM model is indeed able to form and maintain bilayers. To this end, an initial biphasic solvent box, containing water and DCLE was set up, and 54 divalerylphosphatidylserine (DVPS, 5:0,5:0) molecules, which were chosen to present the head groups and shortened acyl chains of PS lipids in this particular HMMM model, equally distributed in that box. A fully formed bilayer formed within 20 ns of MD and was stable in the remainder of that 40 ns simulation. Comparison to a DOPS (18:1,18:1) membrane simulated under the same conditions confirmed that the HMMM model was able to reproduce the atomic distribution of various chemical groups in the membrane, in particular in the head group region that is often essential for protein binding. Furthermore, the extent of hydration and the degree of counterion penetration was similar compared to the full-membrane system. As a second test, a set of five simulations were performed to calculate the lateral diffusion constant of the lipids in the HMMM model and its dependence on different configurations. The lateral diffusion constants of the DVPS molecules were found in the range of 10\u22125\u201310\u22126 cm2 s\u22121, presenting an increase of one to two orders of magnitude in comparison to the full-membrane system. This improvement enables more efficient sampling of head group configurations, e.g., during the binding and insertion of peripheral proteins. To test this, the authors employed the HMMM model for studying the membrane association of the coagulation Factor VII GLA domain, which is involved in the membrane binding of different peripheral proteins. The GLA domain is a common membrane-anchoring domain in coagulation proteins and predominantly binds to PS-rich regions of the cellular membrane, resulting in an increase of the catalytic activity of these proteins. At the time of the original HMMM model study, classical AA-MD simulations failed to reproduce the association of the GLA domain to membranes, while this event was sampled within 50 ns of MD simulations using a PS-HMMM model.166\n",

Despite its various successful applications, it should be noted that the HMMM model also exhibits several limits. First, it cannot be applied for accurately representing the energetics and processes at the membrane core because the behavior of DCLE significantly differs from that of acyl chains in the lipid bilayer core.170, 173 Second, simulations of TM proteins with the HMMM model are still difficult as the DCLE solvent destabilizes multihelix TM domains in the core region.173 Finally, it still remains to be shown whether the HMMM model can also reproduce the characteristics of membranes involving other lipids, such as sphingolipids and sterols.",

The MARTINI model generally employs a mapping scheme that represents four atoms with one CG bead; there are some special situations that require the assignment of fewer atoms to a bead. The speed up achievable with the MARTINI model is immediately apparent if one considers the implication of the reduced degree of freedom. In AA-FFs, atom types are required to more accurately describe different chemical environments (see chapter \u201cPairwise-additive and polarizable atomistic force fields for molecular dynamics simulations of proteins\u201d by Lemkul and also Section 2.1). For instance, in the GROMOS53A6 UA-FF, the 17 atoms commonly encountered in biomolecular systems have specially defined parameter sets. Carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen have 15, 9, 7, and 3 atom type definitions, respectively; in total, there are 53 atom types for all seventeen atoms. This directly leads to 53!/(2! \u22c5 (53 \u2212 2)!) = 1378 combinations of nonbonded atom type pairs. By mapping four heavy atoms into one CG current implementation (version 2.2) has four essential bead types: (1)apolar bead C for modeling hydrophobic groups like butane;(2)polar bead P for modeling groups that are readily soluble in water such as ethylene glycol;(3)nonpolar bead N for modeling groups which are partly polar and partly apolar like propyl alcohol); and(4)charged bead Q for modeling explicitly charged groups like ammonium.\n",

First, smaller beads are required to correctly model structural peculiarities, especially in ring systems where two or three atoms are mapped to one CG bead. Such beads are distinguishable in the topology by having an S prefix (e.g., SP for a small polar bead) with the LJ parameters scaled down. The normal MARTINI CG beads employ a vdW radius of \u03c3 = 0.47 nm (see Eq. 4), while a value scaled down by 91.5% is employed for the S beads, but only when computing interactions with another bead of the S subtype. Similarly, the \u025b value (corresponding to the LJ well depth and binding energy between two atoms/beads, see Eq. 4), associated with the main bead types is scaled by 0.75 when computing the interaction between two small beads. Second, specially big antifreeze particles, called BP4, with their vdW radius scaled up to \u03c3 = 0.57 nm and to \u025b = 5.6 kJ/mol for all interactions with P4 beads of the MARTINI CG water model were introduced. The large particle size of the BP4 beads as well as the strong interaction with water beads disrupt the otherwise neatly ordered lattice packing of the similarly sized water beads, which in earlier MARTINI version caused the water to freezing at temperatures higher than the freezing point of real water.63\n",

            "text": "The detailed presentation of the few bead types illustrates the basis of simulation speedup and improved sampling of the phase space achievable with a CG model like the MARTINI FF. Improved efficiency is obtained in many more ways, including simplified representation of bond types and the use of a uniform bead mass of 72 amu (equivalent to the mass of four water molecules). AA-FFs often use different force constants, equilibrium bond lengths, and angles for treating bonded potentials (Section 2.1). Instead, the MARTINI FF uses a 1.25 \u00d7103 kJ mol\u22121 nm\u22122 harmonic force constant and a 0.47 nm equilibrium length for its pseudo-bonds. However, the FF retains the flexibility of tuning both force constant and equilibrium distance in cases, where more accurate description of molecular topology is desired. A particularly large increase in computational efficiency is achieved by the use of short-range potentials. The potential energy function employed by the MARTINI model closely mirrors the generally adopted expression in most AA-FFs (the full potential energy function is presented in Eqs. 3 and 4), i.e., the vdW interaction is modeled using the LJ 12/6 potential and electrostatic interactions are modeled with the Coulombic function. Beads i and j are separated by a distance r\nij, \u025b\nij is the LJ well depth and binding energy between beads i and j. The LJ interaction strength is discretized into 10 energy levels (0 to IX) parameterized to reproduce oil/water partition constants and varying from a most attractive \u025b = 5.6 kJ/mol inter-particle binding energy to the least attractive \u025b = 2.0 kJ/mol as it may occur for a charged bead interacting with a strongly apolar bead.63 The LJ parameter \u03c3\nij is the vdW radius of the bead using 0.47 nm as the default. Special cases, involving aromatic rings require the use of CG beads with smaller bead radius, that is the S bead discussed above. Together, these result in a distance-dependent accounting of the LJ energy, which is continuously shifted in a way that it becomes zero at 1.1 nm cutoff. It should be noted that in MARTINI dipolar interactions, involving partial charges, are adequately captured by the LJ interaction matrix just explained, such that only the interactions involving explicitly charged beads of the Q type (with charges q\ni and q\nj) are modeled with a Coulombic expression. In order to correct the increase in hydration strength resulting from some of the recently introduced bead types, the dielectric constant in the latest version of the MARTINI FF was reduced from \u025b\nr = 20 employed in the 2003 model62 to \u025b\nr = 15.63 The Coulombic interactions are similarly screened to zero at 1.1 nm cutoff as done for the LJ potential.",

            "text": "As earlier discussed, the structure of most lipids is traditionally divided into a head group which is usually charged or polar, and one or more aliphatic tail groups. The differences among the thousands of lipids in existence essentially derive from the structural differences in the head groups and aliphatic tails. The head group of DPPC consists of a positively charged choline (N+(CH3)3, dark blue bead in Fig. 7A lipid structure) which in the MARTINI FF is modeled with a Q0 bead (charged without forming HB), and a negatively charged phosphate (PO4, orange bead in Fig. 7A lipid structure) group modeled as Qa (charged and acting as HB acceptor). With these assignments, the charged state and the hydrogen bonding property of the lipid head group are appropriately captured (the charge of each bead needs to be explicitly specified in the topology parameter file). The two uncharged C16-aliphatic chains of palmitic acid (light blue beads in Fig. 7A lipid structure) are each represented with four C1 beads, which are hydrophobic and with the least possible polarity. There are certain instances, however, where the chemistry of the compound demands some degree of uneven distribution in the CG mapping. In such a situation, the exact choice of mapping will ultimately depend on the user but importantly also on the property to be investigated. In a case where the the lipid aliphatic tails contain uneven number of carbon atoms, e.g., for a C15 saturated system, there is the additional need to maintain molecular symmetry in the mapping. For instance, using -C1(3)-C1(4)-C1(4)-C1(4) bead (number of atoms per bead in parentheses) mapping for the sn-1 tail and -C1(4)-C1(3)-C1(4)-C1(4) mapping for the sn-2 tail would introduce some level of dissymmetry in the two tails.63 The charged PC head group and the hydrophobic lipid tail region are linked together by a glycerol backbone, which forms an ester bond with each aliphatic tail (Figs. 2A and 7A). This glyceryl ester bridge is represented with a nonpolar HB acceptor Na bead (red beads in Fig. 7A lipid structure) for each of two the hydrophobic tails. Qualitatively, this representation suffices since the otherwise electronic (polar and HB) property has been coarse-grained into the Na linker bead. This is especially appropriate since the standard bond length has been reduced to 0.37 nm for this particular bead in an attempt to capture its peculiarities.63 However, if it is desirable to more explicitly reflect the polarity of the C1 bead proximal to the polar linker bead, it is possible to tune MARTINI parameters to capture the specific property of interest.",

This was achieved in spite of its simplicity in the treatment of chemical systems and the unavoidable loss of atomic resolution.62, 63, 176 By reducing the degrees of freedom in a physicochemically meaningful manner and, by adopting a bottom-up parameterization approach focused on reproducing experimental thermodynamic properties, the FF has been able to achieve a good degree of transferability to nonlipid biological systems, for which it was not originally designed. Good concordance with experimental data was obtained in the values of the partition free energy with various solvent systems as presented in Table 3\nreproduced from reference.63 In most cases, agreement between the MARTINI model (computed from the density distribution for the MARTINI model) was obtained within 1 k\nB\nT of experimental partition free energy values, and in some cases within 2 k\nB\nT (Boltzmann constant: k\nB = 1.381 \u22c5 10\u221223 m2 kg s\u22122 K\u22121; Temperature: T = 293 K). A consequence of modeling nonbonded interaction with the LJ 12/6 potential is an overestimation of vaporization and hydration free energies, which was also observed for the MARTINI FF. This was shown to result in the underestimation of the water/vapor tension, especially in tested systems containing 1600 CG beads. Nevertheless, this is not of great concern as long as it is employed in studying condensed phases, where events are mostly governed by the partition free energies, which were correctly reproduced by the MARTINI FF. And of course, properties dependent on the degrees of freedom approximated out by the MARTINI FF cannot be directly investigated, expect by coupling to a multiscale modeling procedure. This is exemplified by the relative insensitivity at reproducing thermodynamic data for 1-propanol and 2-propranol63 in Table 3.",

Furthermore, the protein structure can be modified by the PDB manipulator to introduce cap groups, mutations, disulfide bridges, unnatural amino acids, or posttranslational modifications, including glycosylation, lipidation for a lipid anchor, phosphorylation, or attachment of a GPI-anchor. Additionally, the protonation state of each residue can be defined or missing residues can be added. Afterwards, the orientation of the protein in or on the membrane can be defined by the user if one does not want to use the preoriented protein coordinates provided by OPM. Several options, like protein flipping, translation along the z-axis, or rotation in the xy-plane are available. The Position of Proteins in Membrane (PPM) server may be of help here, as it calculates rotational and translational positions of transmembrane and peripheral proteins in membranes.199 It is thus possible to place the protein in or on the membrane, or with a defined distance away from the membrane.

            "text": "There is no freely available tool for setting up protein\u2013membrane systems with OPLS-AA. Also, the atom naming does not follow that of CHARMM C36 lipids or AMBER Slipids, suggesting that converting a CHARMM-GUI output to OPLS-AA is not possible. Instead, the setup of a protein\u2013membrane system can be done in two steps. First, tools such as MemGen\n215 and PACKMOL216 can be used to build the pure lipid membrane from a PDB file of a single lipid. Second, the protein can be positioned above the membrane surface using VMD217 or using the GROMACS tool editconf. For TM proteins, the protein may be embedded inside the membrane using VMD, mdrun_hole,218\nInflateGRO,219\nInflateGRO2,220 or g_membed.221 However, these tools remove lipids overlapping with the protein, which is problematic when preparing multicomponent systems with varying concentrations. Addressing the problem, Javanainen et al.222 developed a universal protocol to insert proteins of various topology inside the membrane without having to remove the lipids. The method is independent of any FF and works by applying high lateral pressure. Thus, for simulations with OPLS-AA a combination of either MemGen\n215 and PACKMOL221 for building the initial membrane patch along with the method developed by Javanainen et al.222 is probably the most efficient way for setting up a protein\u2013membrane system. Topologies, structures, and parameter files for OPLS-AA can be obtained from Kulig et al.150, 151\n",

First, the Python script martinize.py automatically converts a PDB file of proteins, DNA or RNA from the AA to the CG model, where the user can decide to use standard MARTINI model for proteins, the elastic network model, or the ElNeDyn method. The elastic network ElNeDyn212 maintains the overall conformation of a protein and limits the capability of changing the tertiary structure (Fig. 7D). Moreover, there is the possibility to change the protonation state of the histidines and to define disulfide bridges. Second, the python script insane.py\n224 enables the user to setup homogeneous and heterogeneous membranes with the possibility to place and rotate the protein molecules above or on the membrane or move them inside.",

They differ in the availability of implemented algorithms, e.g., for the integration of Newton's equations of motions (see Eq. 2), the available thermostats and barostats, in their computational performance, in their support of various FFs, and in their availability of analysis tools. In GROMACS and NAMD, one can choose from a wide range of standard and custom FFs (e.g., all kinds of CHARMM, OPLS-AA, and AMBER FFs), whereas the MD engines CHARMM and AMBER only support their own FFs. Furthermore, some MD software packages are not freely available, such as AMBER for performing MD simulations but the corresponding analyzing package AmberTools230 is freely available for academic purpose. Finally, the user has to consider which analysis tools are provided by the MD programs. For example, GROMACS has the big advantage that it comes with huge and diverse set of analysis tools, covering both analyses of protein and membrane properties, which can be easily modified and redistributed if a given tool should not exactly exhibit the required functionality. NAMD is implemented in VMD,217 which provides powerful visualization capabilities, a graphical user interface (GUI), dynamic atom selections, and allows the reading of multiple file formats, including those obtained by all common MD packages.",

            "text": "The human \u03b2\n2AR is primarily expressed in pulmonary, skeletal, and cardiac muscles. It is a major drug target for treatment of asthma, respiratory diseases and heart failure. Recent structural and biochemical studies suggest that the receptor exists in multiple conformations and that binding of cholesterol affects the conformation and signaling. Cholesterol could induce its effect either by altering the membrane properties or by direct specific interactions with the receptor. Although structures solved with cholesterol bound to \u03b2\n2AR indicate the availability of specific cholesterol binding sites on the receptor, the mechanism explaining the modulatory role of cholesterol is still unknown. To clarify the effect of cholesterol on \u03b2\n2AR, Manna et al.,253 performed extensive atomistic MD simulations (>100 \u03bcs) of \u03b2\n2AR embedded in 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)/CHOL membrane, with cholesterol concentration ranging from 0 to 40 mol%. In addition, simulations were also carried out using the cholesterol analog cholesteryl hemisuccinate, since it is commonly used in experiments to mimic cholesterol. This study reported two binding sites on the intracellular side (IC1 and IC2) and one binding site on the extracellular side (EC1) for cholesterol (Fig. 8\nA and B). Binding at IC1/EC1 sites are supported by with the crystal structures,37, 251, 265 however, the relevance of the additional binding at site IC2 has to be experimentally validated. Cholesteryl hemisuccinate also binds to \u03b2\n2AR at the same sites as cholesterol, but the binding is weaker in comparison to cholesterol. The study also shows that in the absence of cholesterol, \u03b2\n2AR adopts multiple conformations, whereas with cholesterol concentration >10 mol% the structural flexibility of \u03b2\n2AR is reduced to one single conformation. These studies conclude that the modulatory effect of cholesterol functions via specific interactions with the receptor and not via modulating the mechanical membrane properties.",

The highest expression levels are found in brain and intermediate levels in heart, where it regulates blood flow and oxygen consumption. A2AR is a target for drugs in the treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Similar to \u03b2\n2AR, cholesterol binding sites have been reported from both experimental (e.g., PDB code: 3EML267)265 and MD studies.259, 260 Also, a stabilizing effect of cholesterol on the receptor has been shown.260 However, the effect of cholesterol on ligand binding has not been explored. To clarify this, Guix\u00e0-Gonz\u00e1lez et al.266 combined both experiments and MD simulations to understand how cholesterol depletion influences ligand binding and dynamics of A2AR. The MD simulations revealed that on average 12 cholesterol molecules are bound to the receptor. The cholesterol molecules were found preferentially bound to TMH2-3, 3-4-5 and 7-1 (Fig. 8C). Of the three regions, cholesterol binding to TMH2-3 is supported by with the experimental structure solved in complex with the ligand.265 The bound cholesterol molecules are required to maintain the stability of the receptor as observed in experiments. Apart from confirming the experimentally known cholesterol binding sites, few additional sites were observed on the surface of the receptor, which could affect ligand binding. The studies also revealed a mechanism in which the cholesterol enters the receptor interior, thus competing with the orthosteric ligand binding site. The path taken by cholesterol to enter the A2AR interior is identical to the retinal pathway in the opsin receptor. These studies indicate that ligand binding to A2AR receptor is regulated by both orthosteric- and allosteric binding of cholesterol to the receptor.",

Opsins and several other class A GPCRs facilitate transbilayer translocation of phospholipids and scramble >10,000 lipids per second when embedded in vesicles.268, 269, 270 When reconstituted in lipid vesicles, opsins are known to accelerate the lipid transfer to a rate of >104 (i.e., 10,000 lipids per second per protein), which is faster than opsin unassisted lipid transfer occurring at a rate of \u223c10\u22125 s\u22121.271 But opsin-mediated lipid transfer is still a rare event taking \u223c100 \u03bcs per lipid per protein. The lipid flipping or the scramblase activity of GPCRs is not only necessary to maintain the photoreceptor cell homeostasis but also finds importance in various other physiological processes, such as in cell growth, blood clotting and apoptotic cell clearance.271, 272, 273, 274 Recently, the molecular events facilitating the receptor-mediated lipid scrambling were characterized by preinserting opsin into membranes composed of POPC/POPG (ratio of 9:1) and performing extensive AA-MD simulations (>50 \u03bcs).263 The study revealed that TMH6 and TMH7 mediate translocation of a lipid from the intracellular to the extracellular side through three steps (Fig. 8D). First, the intracellular disruption of TMH6-E249\u2013TMH7-K311 interaction and conformational switch of residue TMH7-Y306. Second, the changes observed in the first step lead to the increase of intracellular distance between TMH6 and TMH7 by \u223c10 \u00c5 which allows influx of water molecules. The created hydrophilic environment favors the lipid to tilt and move toward the membrane center. Third, the distance between TMH6 and TMH7 in the membrane center is increased by \u223c5 \u00c5, thereby creating a continuous water channel enabling the lipid to completely flip. The lipid translocation event observed here occurs at a timescale of \u223c33 \u03bc, which is consistent with experimental lipid transfer, taking place at \u223c100 \u03bcs or smaller.269, 275\n",

            "text": "MD simulations along with hydrogen\u2013deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) have proven to be robust methods to characterize dynamics of transporters in different membrane systems, such as liposomes, micelles, bicelles, and nanodiscs. Recently, Martens et al.,277 combined these methods to understand how direct interactions with lipids modulate the conformational dynamics of secondary transporters, such as LacY and XylE. The two transporters (XylE, PDB code: 4JA4278 and LacY, PDB code: 2CFQ279) in their inward-open conformation were embedded into bilayers, composed of DOPE/DOPG/CL (70/20/10 mol%) and DOPC/DOPG/CL (70/20/10 mol%) lipids, and AA-MD simulations were carried out to identify how lipids regulate the conformational switch at the molecular level. The simulations reveal that PE lipids localize between the TMH2 and TMH11, where they interacts with R84 and with the switch residue E153 (Fig. 9A\n). The interactions stabilize the transporter in the inward-open state, preventing the conformational switch. In contrast, simulations in PC membrane shifts the conformation by closing the intracellular side. This conformation change is initiated by movement of TMH2/3 toward TMH10/11, which reduces the distance to \u223c9 \u00c5 in the PC bilayer, whereas in the PE bilayer it is at \u223c13 \u00c5. Similar direct interactions between E139 and PE lipids were observed in LacY simulations. This study again highlights the role of lipids in regulating conformational changes.",

            "text": "Belonging to the neurotransmitter transport family, hDAT are responsible for clearance of dopamine neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft into the cytosol, thereby terminating the dopamine signal. Increased activity or mutations in hDAT are associated with several disorders, such as depression, psychiatric and neurological disorders, and they also effect cognitive functions. To gain insights into the activation mechanism of hDAT, Khelashvili et al.,280 performed extensive AA-MD simulations (>14 \u03bcs) on a full-length hDAT embedded in a lipid membrane composed of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) lipids. The study reveals the molecular details leading to the conformational shift from outward- to inward-open state (Fig. 9B and C). This shift also causes the release of a sodium ion from its Na2 site and the destabilization of dopamine from its S1 binding site (Fig. 9D). Closer examination of the membrane environment shows that PIP2 mediates the association of the N-terminal segment and the intracellular loop 4 (ICL4) by forming electrostatic interactions with N-terminal residues K3, K5, K27, K35, R51 and with ICL4 residues H442, R443, H444. The N-terminal/ICL4 association stabilizes the inward-open state. To further validate the importance of PIP2, additional simulations were carried out by replacing PIP2 with POPE lipids. In absence of PIP2 the stabilized N-terminal/ICL4 complex dissociates rapidly. The PIP2-induced conformation shift and the transition mechanism reported for hDAT is similar to the activation mechanism of structurally similar Leucine transporter (LeuT).281\n",

The channel function is regulated by a conformational switch between the closed and open states. Moreover, several factors are involved in the process, including proteins and lipids. Among lipids, the negatively charged PIP2 is required to activate all Kir channels. Apart from PIP2, cholesterol is another important molecule involved in Kir regulation. Here, we discuss how PIP2 and cholesterol regulates Kir2.1 activity. Li et al.58 employed atomistic targeted MD (TMD) method to observe Kir2.1 channel opening from a closed state. By comparing X-ray structures of Kir channels, the authors recognized the conformational change of the C-linker (C-terminus region of the inner helix) loop to a helical conformation, and the structures further revealed PIP2 binding sites on the C-linker. Guided by the hypothesis that PIP2 could induce the conformational change of the C-linker, they carried out TMD on the C-linker residues (K185 to T192) with a goal to change the secondary structure from a loop to a helix. The change to the more rigid helical structure, which is stabilized by interactions with PIP2, pulls the cytoplasmic domain (CD) \u223c5 \u00c5 toward the membrane, which enables contact with the TM domain. The first stage of TMD results in pushing the channel toward an active state. To achieve the fully active state, TMD was again applied to guide the C-linker\u2013PIP2 complex toward a partial helical conformation. The partially folded C-linker kinks, leading to a \u223c8 degrees rotation of the N- and C-termini, which shifts the CD downwards, thus, reaching a full open channel. The study reports all the keys necessary for the conformational shift, hence providing a detailed picture into PIP2-induced opening of Kir channel.",

However, the cholesterol binding sites were yet to be located. Avia et al.,284 combined experimental as well as several computational methods such as docking, atomistic MD simulations and molecular mechanics Poisson\u2013Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) calculations to shed light on the cholesterol binding sites and their role in regulation of channel activity. Initial docking studies showed that cholesterol mainly binds at the TM domain interfaces at three typical binding poses. Two additional poses were located at the cytosolic domain. Subsequent MD simulations of Kir2.1 with bound cholesterol embedded in a lipid membrane revealed a rearrangement of cholesterol into two distinct binding sites. Site 1 corresponds to the center of the TM domain, whereas site 2 is near the cytosolic domain. To gain insights into the binding energies at these two sites, MM/PBSA approach was used, which indicated cholesterol to bind slightly stronger at the site 1. The study concludes with the identification of two binding sites for cholesterol on Kir2.1 channel with large cholesterol flexibility within the two sites. Furthermore, mutation studies and functional analysis reveal that the identified binding sites may interfere with motion of the inner helix, which is required for keeping the channel in a closed state.",

Mobarak et al.226 carried out microsecond timescale simulations of LPS bound to glycosylated TLR4 complex, embedded in asymmetric membrane composed of CHOL/SM/GluCer/PC lipids (45/25/10/20 mol%) in the outer leaflet and CHOL/PS/PE/PC lipids (35/20/20/25 mol%) in the inner leaflet. To study the effect of Glucosylceramide (GluCer) on the receptor, additional simulations were performed without GluCer in the outer leaflet and the composition was adjusted to CHOL/SM/PC (45/35/20 mol%) in the outer leaflet and the inner leaflet lipids were unmodified. The simulations showed that LPS induced tilting of the TLR4 extracellular domain, however, tilting was reduced and TLR4 was stabilized in membrane containing GluCer. Quantification of tilt angles showed that the LPS/TLR4 complex tilted by \u223c33 and 57 degrees in the presence and absence of GluCer, respectively (Fig. 10A\n). However, in the absence of LPS, TLR4 only tilted by 15 and 19 degrees in the presence and absence GluCer, respectively. It was unlikely that direct interactions between GluCer and TLR4 would reduce tilting since the GluCer head group is small and uncharged, whereas TLR4 is a negatively charged protein. The authors speculated that the reduced tilting could be due to altering of the membrane properties by GluCer. A subsequent analysis revealed that the electrostatic potential of the membrane increased by 30% in presence of GluCer. Thus, the authors concluded that repulsive interactions between the LPS/TLR4 complex and the membrane reduced the tilting of LPS/TLR4 in the presence of GluCer. In addition, the authors observed that the effect of tilting on the extracellular side translated to the TM domains, where the conformation of the TM helix was altered in absence of GluCer, further emphasizing the stabilizing effect of GluCer on the LPS/TLR4 complex.",

The monomeric and dimeric structures were embedded into a lipid membrane composed of POPC/POPE/CL (ratio of 5:3:2). The X-ray structure (PDB code: 2DYR293) revealed that each CcO monomer has two CL binding sites, where one of the sites (site 2) is located at the interface of the two CcO monomers, suggesting a possible role in stabilizing the dimer structure (Fig. 10B). During MD simulations, CL occupied the crystallographically known site 1 throughout the simulations; however, at the buried site 2, CL was only weakly bound and dissociated within 1 \u03bcs. The dissociation of CL on site 2 occurred first by a movement of the CL head group away from the site, and then by tails, suggesting stronger interactions between the CL tails and protein hydrophobic interface. In contrast, CL at site 1, where it binds more strongly, is stabilized by strong ionic interactions. Additional simulations in the absence of CL at buried site 2, but with crystallographic bound PG/PE, revealed no effect on the stability of the dimer structure; however, removal of CL from site 1 not only destabilized the protein structure but also perturbed the strongly bound PG and PE lipids from their respective binding sites. This destabilization would potentially lead to loss of enzyme function. Thus, these simulation results provide an explanation at the atomistic level for the experimentally observed activity loss of CcO upon removal of CL.",

A\u03b2 exists in two isoforms, A\u03b2\n40 and A\u03b2\n42, with the latter being more prone to aggregation and more toxic.309 Furthermore, several studies have shown that A\u03b2 oligomers and not the fibrils are the causative agent of AD.310, 311, 312 Since, A\u03b2 peptide is a cleaved product of the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP), it is also widely accepted that A\u03b2 interactions with the membrane could play a role in the formation of toxic oligomers.313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318 In spite of experimental and computational studies exploring and proposing several possible mechanisms toward A\u03b2 induced cell toxicity, it is still difficult to draw any conclusion on the neurotoxicity mechanism.

In addition, it was investigated how various A\u03b2\n42 mutants (K16M, E22G, D23G, and K28M) affect membrane stability. These simulations showed that the stability of the peptide inside the membrane is influenced by the degree of lipid acyl chain unsaturation and by the head group charge. Peptides were most stable in POPC bilayers, whereas pronounced peptide instability was observed in DPPC and POPG bilayers. Simulations also revealed that the \u03b2-sheet tetrameric structure increases water permeation into membranes (Fig. 11A\n), indicating that, indeed, A\u03b2\n42 oligomers and not monomers are the toxic species.

Neuronal cell membranes are complex with several lipid species and vary in head group charge, size and saturation/unsaturation level of acyl tails. To resolve how different lipids affect A\u03b2\n42 structure, Owen et al.322 carried out AA-MD simulations of A\u03b2\n42 on membranes composed of POPC/CHOL (70/30 mol%), POPC/CHOL/SM (30/40/30 mol%) and POPC/CHOL/GM1 (70/25/5 mol%). The simulations provide molecular insights into the role of cholesterol (CHOL), sphingomyelin (SM) and ganglioside (GM1) lipids in conversion of A\u03b2\n42 structure to toxic oligomers. The presence of SM, renders membrane highly rigid, which in turn reduces interactions between highly disordered N-terminus residues of A\u03b2\n42 and the membrane. The only interaction observed is between residue R5 and SM, which prevents A\u03b2\n42 from bouncing back to the aqueous solution. The lack of interactions promotes \u03b2-sheet formation in the N-terminus, thus, the final topology is a conformation with central loop connecting N- and C-terminal \u03b2-sheets (Fig. 11C). This final structure resembles experimentally known A\u03b2 fibril structure. In comparison, GM1 has small effect on the membrane property but does not induce secondary structure change. The membranes with or without GM1 had no effect on the structure of the A\u03b2\n42. Thus, the results provide new insight into the role of SM ceramide in altering membrane property and in formation of toxic A\u03b2\n42 oligomers.",

            "text": "Apart from the lipids discussed above, neuronal membranes also contain large amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6). AD has been associated with reduction of DHA lipids from 23% in normal brain to 12% in AD brain.325, 326, 327 In vitro studies have shown that DHA inhibits A\u03b2\n42 fibril formation.328 To better understand the inhibitory role of DHA, Ntarakas et al.,323 carried out MD simulations of A\u03b2 peptide fragments A\u03b2\n1\u201328 and A\u03b2\n26-40 in single component bilayers (DMPC\u2013 14:0,14:0 or SDPC\u2013 18:0,22:6) and in mixed bilayers (DSPE\u2013 18:0,18:0, DDPE\u2013 22:6,22:6, DPPC\u2013 16:0,16:0, DOPC\u2013 18:1,18:1) with varying composition. The mixed bilayer is divided into two types based on lipid composition. The mixed bilayer with high fraction of DHA is referred to as \u201cnormal bilayer\u201d and the other bilayer with low fraction of DHA and high fraction of saturated lipids is referred to as \u201cAD bilayer\u201d (Fig. 11D). The simulation results from single component bilayer show that in DMPC bilayer, both the A\u03b2 fragments prefer to stay on the membrane surface. In contrast, in presence of 18:0\u201322:6 PC, A\u03b2\n1\u201328 partially enters the membrane and the A\u03b2\n26\u201340 fragment even fully inserts into the membrane. The behavior of the A\u03b2 fragments in DMPC bilayer is consistent with the experimental data.329 Similar trends were observed for A\u03b2 interaction when studied in mixed bilayer. The A\u03b2\n1\u201328 fragment fully enters the normal bilayer with high fraction of DHA and stays on the membrane surface of an AD bilayer. However, the A\u03b2\n26\u201340 fragment penetrates both the normal and AD bilayers. The authors next looked into the aggregation propensity of these peptides, and they observed that both A\u03b2 fragments clustered on the membrane surface in DMPC and AD bilayer, but they were more dispersed in normal bilayer. Thus, the study suggests the presence of DHA to favor internalization of A\u03b2 peptide, which in turn prevents aggregation and formation of toxic oligomers on the membrane surface.",

The A\u03b2\n29\u201342 dimers in both helical and \u03b2-sheet conformations were fully preinserted into a bilayer of POPC, 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SAPC\u03c96 18:0,20:4) and 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SDPC\u03c93 18:0,22:6). For the \u03b2-sheet conformation, an additional simulation was carried with the peptide fully inserted into a mixed bilayer composed of POPC/SAPC/SDPC lipids. The simulations show both SDPC\u03c93 and SAPC\u03c96 to stabilize the helical dimer structure (80% \u03b1-helix) with a parallel orientation and reorient the G33\u2013X\u2013X\u2013X\u2013G37 motif with SDPC\u03c93 favoring Gly-out and SAPC\u03c96 favoring Gly-side orientation (Fig. 11E). However, SAPC\u03c96 disorders the \u03b2-sheet dimer by reducing its \u03b2-sheet content from 59% to 44% and inducing \u03b1-helix conformation by 7% (Fig. 11E). SDPC\u03c93 and POPC bilayers behave similarly with no large effect on the \u03b2-sheet dimer. However, in a mixed membrane, the \u03b2-sheet dimer is stabilized with high \u03b2-sheet content (\u223c63%), thus SDPC\u03c93 and POPC lipids suppress the individual effect of SAPC\u03c96 on the peptide.

However, the exact membrane disruption mechanism is still not clear. Here, we present results from AA-MD simulations of hIAPP-membrane interactions and focus mainly on how different lipids affect hIAPP binding, orientation, aggregation, and insertion into membranes which provide insight into the membrane disruption mechanism.",

Simulations show that hIAPP adopts four different orientations in POPC membrane. N-terminal residues localize at the hydrophilic head group region of the lipid, whereas the C-terminal residues penetrate deep into the membrane (Fig. 12A\n). In case of simulations with POPG membrane, the peptide adopts a single, surface-bound orientation. The lack of membrane penetration exposes the aggregation-prone C-terminal residues 20\u201337 to peptide\u2013peptide interactions.

During simulation, the dimers inserted deep into the membrane with residues K1 anchoring to the lipid head group (Fig. 12C). The interaction perturbs the phosphorous atoms around the dimer in both, the upper and the lower leaflets, which results in a reduction of membrane thickness in close proximity to the dimer. Analysis of the lipid order parameters revealed that the hIAPP dimer also decreases the ordering of carbon atoms close to the head group. During an additional simulation, the order parameters were also decreased at carbon atoms 5\u201312, close to the membrane center.

The monomeric system was multiplied to have four peptides on a membrane composed of divalerylphosphatidylserine (DVPS, 30%) and zwitterionic divalerylphosphatidylcholine (DVPC, 70%) lipids. To enhance the diffusion of lipids and peptides, the highly mobile membrane mimetic (HMMM) model was utilized. The simulations suggested that self-assembly takes place in the following order (Fig. 13A\n): (1) the monomers diffuse on the membrane surface with N-terminal residues (K1 and R11) anchoring the peptide to the membrane; (2) the aromatic residues (F15 and F23) in the central region of the peptide initiate peptide\u2013peptide interactions. For the self-assembly to start, the interactions between peptide and membrane observed in step 1 must break, leading to a partial unfolding of the secondary structure; (3) the initial aromatic interactions allow the peptide segment 22-NFGAIL-27 to form stable interactions; (4) self-assembly induces \u03b2-sheet formation in segments 14-NFLVH-18 and 25-AILSST-30, which are involved in intra- and inter-peptide interactions. In these simulations, the H18 residue was modeled as electroneutral during the self-assembly process, since a charged H18 residue would have increased the interaction with the PS lipid head group, thereby stabilizing the secondary structure and repelling the peptides, which would inhibit the self-assembly process.

The channels were fully inserted into DOPC bilayer for studying the ion conductivity. MD simulations revealed a loss of the \u03b2-sheet secondary structure, which destabilized the channels into unstable loosely packed subunits.

These authors noticed that the protofibril is partially inserted into dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) monolayer with an tilt angle of 48 degrees. To check for the stability of protofibrils in lipid membranes, Poojari et al.,338 carried out atomistic simulations of protofibrils (trimer and tetramer structures) partially inserted into DPPG monolayers and bilayers at an tilt angle of 48 degrees (Fig. 13C). The simulations show protofibrils to adopt a tilt angle of 40 degrees in DPPG monolayers, which is close to 48 degrees measured in experiments. However, in bilayers the protofibrils penetrate deep into the membrane with an angle of 60 degrees. The protofibril inside the membrane is stabilized by close interactions with the lipid head groups. Furthermore, trimer structures in both monolayer and bilayer were structurally less stable when compared to tetramer due to increased flexibility of the outer \u03b2-strands. The flexible trimer structure distorts into a \u03b2-sandwich structure which further perturbs the membrane integrity, thereby allowing the permeation of water and sodium ions. This study revealed for the first time key details of protofibril structures, such as the stability and the orientation of protofibril in lipid membranes, the formation of \u03b2-sandwich structure by protofibrils, membrane disruption, and conductance of water and ions.",

Studies with DOPS350 bilayer shows aSyn to localize below the lipid head group region and the protein orients such that the hydrophilic side of the protein faces the lipid head group/water. The peptide had no effect on the DOPS membrane structure. Garten et al.,351 carried out atomistic simulations to understand how aSyn packs and alters mechanical properties of DOPC, DPhPC and SAPC bilayers. The simulations revealed that aSyn was absorbed into all the bilayers, and shallow packing defects were observed in both SAPC and DPhPC bilayers.

            "text": "Recently, Steringer et al.365 tested the key predictions from biochemical studies using AA-MD simulations. To observe the spontaneous interaction of FGF2 monomers with PI(4,5)P2, the protein was placed 1.5 nm above the mixed membrane composed of POPC/CHOL (70/30 mol%) in the outer leaflet and POPC/CHOL/PIP2 (65/29.5/5.5 mol%) in the inner leaflet. The simulations revealed FGF2 to spontaneously bind to PI(4,5)P2 through the known binding pocket residues K127, R128, and K133, thus, confirming with the biochemical studies (Fig. 16A\n). In addition, simulations showed that FGF2 adopts two different orientations on the membrane surface, called (1) high-affinity orientation evident by strong interaction energies and (2) low-affinity orientation evident by weak interactions. In the high-affinity orientation, FGF2 orients with C95 being accessible to form a disulfide bridge with the second monomer. Whereas in low-affinity, both C95 and C77 are available to form a disulfide bridge with the second monomer, but the interaction with PI(4,5)P2 is weakened with only R128 making contact with PI(4,5)P2. The weak interaction with the PI(4,5)P2 might be a transient state and formation of stable dimers or higher ordered structures with such orientation might not be possible. To test the dependence of PI(4,5)P2 on FGF2 orientation, the authors also simulated in presence of a single PI(4,5)P2 in the membrane. The simulations showed a specificity of FGF2 for binding PI(4,5)P2 with its known binding pocket residues, however, the protein orientation was never stable but instead continuously fluctuating between high- and low-affinity orientations. These results indicate that more than a single PI(4,5)P2 is required to stabilize the protein on the membrane surface and to promote oligomerization. Having established the binding and orientation for a single FGF2, the next step was to identify the dimeric interface required for oligomer formation. Since trimer structures were the minimal oligomer size observed in experiments, simulations were initiated with three monomers placed 0.5 nm above the membrane surface and arranged such that two monomers faced each other at 0.7 nm and a third monomer faced the other monomers at 1.5 nm distance. During simulations, all three monomers formed stable interactions with PI(4,5)P2 and adopt the high-affinity orientation. The two nearby monomers dimerized with C95\u2013C95 interactions at the interface, and the structure was further stabilized by four salt bridges formed by two pairs of E86\u2013K118 and E99\u2013K85. The third monomer approached the dimer with the C77\u2013C77 residues at the interface and further stabilized by salt bridges R47\u2013D49, D45\u2013R41, and R80\u2013E53. The dimer interfaces involving residues C95\u2013C95 (interface 1) and C77\u2013C77 (interface 2) observed in MD simulations are consistent with the in vitro studies. Thus, this study establishes a minimal molecular basis required for FGF2 to initially bind PI(4,5)P2 and to aggregate to large oligomers, which would eventually create membrane pores and escape into extracellular space. The molecular mechanism described here for FGF2 could be related to other PI(4,5)P2-dependent unconventionally secreting molecules, such as HIV-Tat366, 367, 368 and Interleukin 1\u03b2.369\n",

The simulations were initiated by placing the PH domain 1.5 nm above a mixed membrane composed of PC, PS, and PI(3,4,5)P3 lipids in varying concentrations. In a neutral pure PC membrane, the PH domain bounced back to the aqueous solution after initial contacts, demonstrating only weak interactions with the PC head groups. However, upon the addition of 20% negatively charged PS lipid to the membrane, the PH domain was found to strongly interact with the membrane throughout the simulations. The interactions were mainly mediated through the loop connecting \u03b21 and \u03b22 strands, where the canonical binding motif is located. The side chains of the key residues R277, V278, and K279 stabilizing the interactions were localized to the phosphate head groups, and no deeper insertion was observed. On addition of highly negatively charged PI(3,4,5)P3 lipids to the membrane, PI(3,4,5)P3 recognized their canonical binding motif and PH domain orient at an angle of 36.9 \u00b1 9.1 degrees relative to the membrane normal. The key residues at the canonical binding site forming hydrogen bonds with the phosphate head groups are K273, R277, K282, R284, and Y298. Simulations also revealed that PI(3,4,5)P3 may recognize the loop connecting \u03b25 and \u03b26 strands, a new binding site previously not reported for the GRP1 PH domain. At this new site, the PH domain orients an angle of 29 \u00b1 11.9 degrees with respect to the membrane normal (Fig. 16B). The key residues at the alternate new site forming hydrogen bonds with the phosphate head groups are R283, R322, and K323. Inspection of the local lipid density revealed that the orientation is influenced by the local concentration of PS lipids, which is higher when PI(3,4,5)P3 binds to the PH domain at its canonical binding site. Furthermore, in presence of PI(3,4,5)P3 V278 was observed to penetrate deep into the membrane. Additional free energy calculations suggested that both binding modes are favorable with higher affinity for binding at canonical binding site. The results from this study provide evidence for lipid-dependent binding and activity of PH domains.",

During the simulations, both proteins interact with the PI(4,5)P2-enriched membrane via their large positively charged surface (Fig. 16C). Cofilin-1 equilibrates within 50\u201360 ns with no change in the number of hydrogen bonds formed with the lipids, whereas moesin, due to its large size and slower diffusion, equilibrates within 150 ns. The large and highly negatively charged PI(4,5)P2 head groups readily bind to experimentally identified binding sites on Cofilin-1 and moesin. Cofilin-1 and moesin is stabilized on the membrane surface by several lysine and arginine residues. In addition to PI(4,5)P2 binding to the known binding site for moesin, binding to an additional site was identified, formed by a patch of nine cationic residues: K3, K35, R40, K72, R246, K254, K258, K262, and K26. On average, Cofilin-1 and moesin bind to 3.0 \u00b1 0.1 and 6.0 \u00b1 0.3 PI(4,5)P2 head groups, respectively. The PI(4,5)P2 binding specificity was not hindered by a large concentration of PS lipids in the membrane. None of the residues identified were able to penetrate deep into the membrane but they were instead localized near phosphate atoms. To estimate the binding free energy difference between these two proteins, umbrella sampling simulations were performed. The calculations estimated that cofilin-1 binds with 12 \u00b1 2 kcal/mol and moesin wtih 33 \u00b1 2 kcal/mol, further highlighting the weak interactions of cofilin-1 with the membrane. Thus, the study reveals that despite the interactions to be mainly electrostatic, the dynamics and affinities of ABPs are different which relates to their differential function.",

First, a repulsive dehydration barrier is developed as the distance between the two membranes is within \u223c30 \u00c5. Second, during the fusion process, membrane strongly deform during fusion, which requires considerable free energy.406 These kinetic barriers are overcome by the action of membrane fusion glycoproteins that are located at the surface of viruses, where they undergo series of conformational changes during fusion. Membrane fusion begins with the proteins in a high-energy, metastable, compacted state. Upon change in pH or upon sensing receptors on the host membrane, the fusion proteins open up and interact with the host membranes through fusion loops or fusion peptides. The protein releases its stored energy by collapsing, thereby forcing the two membranes into close proximity, hence favoring the formation a hemifused state (Fig. 17A\n). Finally, a stable low-energy fusion pore is formed, allowing the release of viral genome.",

Similar to class I proteins, class III proteins contain a central trimeric \u03b1-helical coiled-coil structure, while the fusion loops extend \u03b2-sheet domains, which is similar to class II (vesicular stomatitis virus, herpes simplex virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, baculovirus).

However, little was known about the lipid specificity of protein\u2013membrane interactions. Thus, Guardado-Calvo et al. solved a new X-ray structure of glycoprotein Gc that adopts a typical class II conformation.408 Remarkably, electron density from a lipid mimic was detected in the crystal, at a site that is expected to be in contact with the host membrane during fusion. The structure was next subjected to MD simulations in DOPC/CHOL membranes to investigate specific lipid binding sites at the fusion loops. In agreement with biochemical studies, MD simulations showed that increase of cholesterol concentration resulted in deep insertion of the fusion loops and, hence, stronger binding to the membrane. The cholesterol-dependent stability was attributed to the ability of cholesterol to occupy space between the DOPC lipids, thereby preventing close packing of DOPC head groups. The loosely packed DOPC head groups allowed the fusion loops to penetrate the membrane, thus forming stable interactions. Further, during the simulations DOPC was seen to bind to the same contact site as also observed in the crystal (Fig. 17B and C). Comparison of the RVFV structure with other class II family members (flavivirus E and alphavirus E1) revealed that the DOPC binding site is largely conserved, suggesting that the site may be widely used by viruses with class II proteins to sense the lipid composition of their host cells.",

Newly synthesized polypeptides are folded inside the ER lumen by chaperones, where also postsynthesis glycosylation takes place. Loss of ER function can result in the accumulation of wrongly folded proteins and other stress factors, resulting a major cellular response to deal with this is through an autophagy receptor-mediated degradative ER-autophagy process (ER-phagy).410 The specific mechanism involved in ER-autophagy has been the subject of different research investigations and it is believed to involve membrane-modulated protein interactions, including the reticulon-homology-domain (RHD) of the ER.

To understand these separate processes, Bhaskara et al. employed a multiscale simulation approach that generated structural models for CG-MD simulations from multiple \u03bcs-long explicit solvent AA-MD sampling.417 The model protein consists of two TM helical hairpins that are connected to another two helical segments composed of amphipathic amino acids. The FAM134B-RHD model structures generated from the AA-MD were embedded in MARTINI lipids using both POPC and mixed lipid bilayers (to model the ER membrane) as well as bicelle model systems. Intracellular aqueous and ionic conditions of the physiological membrane were mimicked with MARTINI water, Na+ and Cl\u2212 models. In total, 95 \u00d7 1 \u03bcs independent FAM134B-RHD-lipid simulations were performed. As reference simulations, 97 \u00d7 1 \u03bcs with empty bicelles (no protein present) and 96 \u00d7 1 \u03bcs membrane systems with inserted KALP15 protein were also performed. KALP proteins contain an alternating A/L sequence, flanked by lysine residues and serve as TM model. They exhibit a TM helical structure with different length, depending on the number of repeating A/L residues. The large-scale CG simulations with the MARTINI FF allowed the detection of very interesting structural phenomena which identified the detailed mechanism by which FAM134B (and by extrapolation other RHD proteins) induces membrane curvature in ER-phagy. First, the overall mechanism was found to proceed via an initial FAM134B RHD domain interaction with the membrane, followed by embedding events facilitated by the amphipathic nature of the RHD. The membrane insertion of the RHD motif perturbed the local symmetry of the membrane and created uneven and extensive asymmetric patches around the amphipathic protein segment. This was observed to directly stretch the lipid layer accompanied by increased area per lipid (curvature induction). This structural remodeling was observed in 97% of all independent FAM134B-RHD membrane simulations. And the membrane curvature was eventually observed to result in complete shape transition from an initial bicellar structure to vesicle formation (Fig. 18\n). In contrast, KALP15 only marginally perturbed the membrane as seen in slight reduction in bilayer thickness in 5 out of total 96 independent CG-MD simulations. The dramatic and complete vesiculation observed in the CG simulations involving FAM134B-RHD shed some light on the role of FAM134B-RHD in provoking structural changes in ER membranes. The vesicles formation facilitates autophagosome clearance and firmly establishes the involvement of specific protein\u2013membrane interactions in ER-phagy. The fact that membrane curvature was not observed with KALP15 further highlights the high specificity of the process for the amphipathic motif of RHD proteins, which in the FAM134 protein family is structurally coupled to LIR motifs that serve as recognition site for autophagosomes.",

Moreover, LDs also provide a buffer area where otherwise toxic endogenous fatty acids are stored and prevented from triggering cell death. The biogenesis of LDs has recently been understood to proceed within the two ER membrane leaflets with an initial lens formation resulting from lipid demixing. For this, integral ER membrane proteins are believed to play a critical role. In addition, a critical concentration of neutral lipids within the ER membrane bilayer is crucial for lipid lens formation to get started, while differences in surface tension between the ER lumenal (the ER interior) and cytoplasmic (the ER exterior) lipid layers as well as the ER membrane protein seipin are important to ensure that nascent LDs bud off the ER membrane from the cytoplasmic lipid monolayer. However, the detailed mechanism of LD formation, including the specific contribution of membrane and protein interactions, remains poorly understood.",

It was shown that RHD interaction with the ER bilayer induces membrane curvature and complete membrane remodeling into vesicles for presentation for degradation by autophagosomes. In the present case study, the ER integral protein seipin was also shown to induce membrane curvature in cytoplasmic ER membrane layer as part of the structural events in LD formation. Furthermore, interaction of triglycerides with seipin resulted in the reduction of the diffusion of the neutral lipids within the membrane bilayer, which was found to encourage the accumulation of triglycerides in the vicinity of the membrane protein. The concentration of triglycerides was observed to double around seipin. Interestingly, experimental studies reported seipin to preferentially localize at ER membrane sites that have been reported to be associated with LD formation. In the absence of seipin, LD biogenesis was significantly impaired.425, 426 LD lens formation occurred in the absence of seipin, but at a much reduced rate. Moreover, lens formation was seen to strongly depend on the concentration of free triglycerides, showing the involvement of a liquid\u2013liquid phase separation process that is principally driven by the equilibrium concentration of triglycerides. By increasing the surface tension of the membrane lipids, an effect that was accomplished via a gradual scaling of the box size in xy-dimension, lens formation was inhibited. In effect, a lower membrane tension was found to favor lens formation, and thus LD generation. This agrees well with the observation that LDs are formed by the cytoplasmic monolayer of the ER membrane, characterized by a surface tension much lower than that of the lumenal ER membrane monolayer. Other factors found to promote liquid\u2013liquid phase separation include the presence of precursor molecules for neutral lipids in the membrane, especially diacylglycerol, cholesterol, as well as unsaturated lipids. ER-like membrane systems were observed to form TG lenses at solute concentrations much lower than membrane systems without cholesterol and diacylglycerol. This was believed to be an adaptive protection mechanism that allows the ER to spontaneous mop up neutral lipids to prevent toxic aggregation.",

In the first CG case study, protein\u2013membrane interaction was investigated using a multiscale simulation approach that clearly demonstrated the influential roles played by a TM protein in membrane vesiculation. The use of a CG-FF made it possible to follow the entire structural process, starting with the interaction of lipid molecules with FAM134B-RHD, to curvature induction in the membrane architecture, and ultimately to vesicle formation. The fact that membrane remodeling was not observed with another TM protein, KALP15, indicates that there exists a degree of specificity in the protein\u2013membrane interaction. In other words, rather than merely providing a structurally dynamic matrix for membrane proteins, lipid membranes are capable of establishing specific binding interactions with proteins, both integral and peripheral. This realization suggests that biological membranes are active participants in biochemical processes rather than functioning as a passive bystander in cellular processes. With an average cell membrane containing many different membrane proteins of diverse structural families (constituting up to 30% of the membrane area), a highly complex interaction pattern is expected between the proteins and the membrane lipids.27, 428, 429\n",

In this work, lipids of 63 different types were distributed asymmetrically between the two membrane leaflets to provide a realistical model of a plasma membrane.33, 224 In the extracellular membrane leaflet, the incorporated lipids feature a higher degree of lipid chain saturation and include gangliosides and PC, but also to some extent cholesterol, SM, ceramide, and diacylglycerol. The cytosolic membrane leaflet, on the other hand, included most of the charged lipids PA, PE, PS, PI, PIP, PIP2, and PIP3 and a higher content of unsaturated fatty acid chains. The inner leaflet further contained lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) lipids. Using the MARTINI FFs, patches of the membrane model were set up, one patch for each of the 10 proteins. Each patch measured 42 nm in both x- and y-dimensions and contained about 6000 mixed lipids as described above. Four copies of each membrane protein were inserted in the membrane patch with each protein copy separated by a distance of about \u223c20 nm from the directly neighbored ones, all four of which were arranged in a square formation (Fig. 19\n). Simulating four copies of the same protein per membrane patch allows for improved statistics. Ten such assemblies were established for the ten protein\u2013membrane assemblies, each of them was simulated for 30 \u03bcs. With the aid of weak position restraints, the protein molecules were kept in place, preventing them from aggregating. In reality, protein aggregation within the membrane matrix remains a possibility. The use of protein position restraints allows for the lateral diffusion of lipid molecules to be studied; by decoupling this from protein aggregation, it becomes easy to observe how each lipid molecule interacts with the protein molecules.",

For this reason, it is also expected that membrane properties will vary with protein composition of the cell membranes, from a particular cell type to another, as well as between individual organisms based on the internal constitution. In other words, the matrix experience presented by the membrane continuum is not as uniform as it might first appear but in actual fact is dictated by specific structural phenomena, resulting from each protein and other membrane constituents.

Next, we have introduced membrane proteins, which along with lipids are essential to carry out different cellular functions. We concluded the section discussing various experimental techniques used in the studies of protein\u2013membrane interactions and the role of computational methods, such as MD simulations in further advancing our knowledge in the field. In Section 2, we have reviewed various FFs used to describe the lipids in MD simulations. The section includes a discussion on the availability of lipid species for each FF and explains the membrane properties commonly used to validate the lipid FFs against experimental data. For a more detailed background on FFs, readers are requested to refer to chapters \u201cPairwise-additive and polarizable atomistic force fields for molecular dynamics simulations of proteins\u201d by Lemkul and \u201cScale-consistent approach to the derivation of coarse-grained force fields for simulating structure, dynamics, and thermodynamics of biopolymers\u201d by Liwo of this book. In Section 3, we have provided some practical information on how to build protein\u2013membrane systems, a list of MD simulation packages and tools available to analyze the output the data from MD simulations. The section begins with a detailed review on CHARMM-GUI functionalities to build various protein\u2013membrane systems for use with the CHARMM FF, followed by methods to set up systems for use with AMBER, OPLS-AA, GROMOS, and MARTINI FFs. In addition, we have also covered the tools available to build glycoproteins and glycolipids for MD simulations. We have concluded this section listing the tools available to analyze the trajectory files created by protein\u2013membrane MD simulations. Finally, in Section 4, we have reviewed MD studies of protein\u2013membrane systems. The section is split into three subsections: first, we have presented case studies of integral membrane proteins elucidated by atomistic simulations; second, we have reported atomistic simulations of peripheral membrane proteins: third, we selected a few case studies that employed CG MD simulations to study biological process of large protein\u2013membrane systems, which are computationally too demanding for an atomistic approach. The reviewed topics include protein-induced bicelle-to-vesicle transformation, spontaneous triglyceride lens formation in lipid droplet biogenesis, and identifying unique lipid fingerprints for membrane proteins of various topology.",

As seen in the presented cases, the recent advancements in the supercomputing facilities along with methodological developments regarding the MD codes has already enabled MD simulations at the microsecond timescale. With regular improvements of FFs to increase their accuracy along with developments of advanced algorithms to speed up MD simulations, the efficacy of the MD studies will further increase in the future. In addition, sustained improvement in experimental techniques, particularly in lipidomic studies, has benefited MD studies immensely in narrowing down from a large pool of lipid species to few specific lipids of interest.",

            "text": "In spite of MD simulations being able to complement experimental results, there are few limitations to be addressed. There are several FFs available for both proteins and lipids, but all have their own shortcomings in reproducing experimental data. Moreover, the simulation of protein\u2013membrane systems requires protein and lipid FFs that are compatible with each other and reproduce the properties of both the protein and the lipid bilayer. The FF benchmarks to date are mostly limited to either proteins or to lipids, while their compatibility and ability to provide a balanced description of protein\u2013lipid interactions has not yet been systematically checked. In terms of application challenges, it should be considered that biological membranes are complex with asymmetric distributions of different lipid species between the two leaflets. Thus, even in the absence of proteins, membranes can undergo curvature and separate into specialized lipid domains. However, most MD simulations are carried out with planar lipid membranes composed of a few selected lipids, rendering them incapable to mimicking the lipid complexity of biological membranes or the observed membrane curvature. Moreover, the traditional way of setting up infinite membrane simulations with periodic boundary conditions further hinders any stabilization of membrane curvature. While mimicking biological membrane composition would be a challenge, spontaneous membrane curvature or protein-induced curvature can be studied using discontinuous finite membranes, such as bicelles, an ideal system to study membrane curvature. Proteins undergo several posttranslational modifications before being transferred into the plasma membrane, and one of the modifications is the covalent attachment of sugar residues or glycans to the proteins. More than 50% of all the eukaryotic proteins are glycosylated, however, only few MD studies have considered protein glycosylation. With the availability of tools to identify glycan sites and build glycoproteins, future MD studies should increase the system complexity by considering glycosylation when required. Such studies would lead to several discussions in the glycobiology field in terms of structure, function and composition of glycans. Experimentally observed conformational changes in protein structure on ligand binding or observing spontaneous lipid-mediated protein structural change is still a challenge with conventional MD simulations. There are several enhanced sampling methods to overcome the limitations, but the systems have to be treated with several biases which would further influence the end results.",

In prokaryotes, like bacteria and archaea, the cell exhibits no compartmentalization, thus, only the plasma membrane exists as barrier shielding the single circular DNA molecule as well as small plasmids along with all other metabolites in cytoplasm. Bacteria also have a cell wall of branched peptidoglycans in addition to the cell membrane. Most eukaryotes feature a membrane-bound nucleus and other organelles like ER, mitochondria, and the Golgi apparatus. In contrast to animals, plant cells have intracellular chloroplasts for photosynthesis, huge water vacuoles and a cell wall that contains plasmodesmata for a special cell\u2013cell communication with the neighbor cells (not shown). (B) The fluid mosaic model describes a lipid bilayer which separates two different environments (intracellular/extracellular or luminal/cytosolic). The bilayer contains lipids that provide a structural scaffold for the membrane system. Integral and peripheral proteins that may contain posttranslational modifications (e.g., glycosylation by several sugars, leading to glycoproteins or -lipids) are found in membranes, serving as transporters and channels for substrates as well as receptors for transmembrane signal transfer. In the last years, the lipid-raft theory has become popular, in which the membrane is separated in nonraft (disordered region, Ld) with polyunsaturated glycerophospholipids (GPLs) and raft-like regions (ordered region, Lo) with high contents of cholesterol (CHOL) and sphingomyelin (SM) in the outer leaflet. Furthermore, proteins and lipids with glycosylation modification as well as glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins are enriched in Lo regions.",

In C site mode, PH domain \u03b21/\u03b22 loops bind to PI(3,4,5)P3, whereas in A site mode, binding takes place with \u03b25/\u03b26 loops. PI(3,4,5)P3 is rendered as spheres, rest of the lipids as lines, protein as orange cartoon and key residues are shown as blue licorice. (C) Conformation of Cofilin-1 and moesin FERM domain on membrane surface. Positively charged amino acids interacting with the lipids are shown as blue licorice, PI(4,5)P2 and POPS lipids are displayed as red and cyan spheres, respectively.",
