The A and B genes encode glycosyltransferases (enzymes) that produce the A and B antigens, respectively. The O gene is considered to be nonfunctional because it determines no detectable blood group antigen. The expression of the O gene results in loss of production of a functional protein or enzyme; consequently, no product is formed. The red cells of a group O individual lack A and B antigens, but have an abundant amount of H antigen. The precursor H enzyme (fucosyltransferase) specifically adds fucose to a terminal galactose, thus giving H antigenic expression. If the glycosyltransferase adds N-acetyl-D-galactosamine to the terminal D-galactose of an H antigen, then the red cells will have the A antigen on their surface. Correspondingly, if the glycosyltransferase adds D-galactose, a B antigen is formed. ABO specificity is dependent on both ABO and Hh genes. Table 1 shows the incidence of the four main phenotypes of the ABO system.",

Variability in genes causes variable reactivity as well add after \"as well.\" Subgroups of B are very rare and less frequent than A subgroups. In the ABO system, naturally occurring antibodies (isoagglutins) are present against A or B antigens. Individuals with the blood group A have isoagglutinins against B red cells and vice versa (see Table 1 ). These antibodies invariably are immunoglobulin (Ig)M that activate complement and cause immediate intravascular hemolysis resulting in severe acute hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTR). They are absent at birth and develop within 3-6 mo of age, when the immune system is exposed to ABH antigenic determinants present in our environment (i.e., bacteria, plants, dust, and food). Antibodies are naturally developed against the ABH antigens absent in the individual. Generally, the antibody titer increases until the age of 10 yr and progressively falls with increasing age in adults. In acquired immunodeficiency states (e.g., leukemias and lymphomas) the levels may be significantly low.",

The Wiener system proposed that the gene product was a single entity with multiple serological specificities. The Fisher-Race system postulated three sets of closely linked genes and gene products (C and c, D and d, and E and e) . Rosenfield proposed a third nomenclature system based on serological reactions, which assigns a number for each Rh antigen. The World Health Organization in Genomic studies have revealed the presence of two closely linked genes (RHD and RHCE) with considerable homology that refutes both Wiener and Fisher-Race postulates. The RHD gene controls the production of the D antigen and is absent in Rh (D)-negative individuals and explains the absence of the \"d\" antigen. The RHCE gene encodes for Cc and Ee antigens. The D and CE polypeptides differ in only 36 amino acids, the C and c polypeptides differ in four amino acids, and E and e differ in only one amino acid. The approximate molecular weight of a nonglycosylated Rh protein is 30 kDa. Recently, a D protein (a mixture of Rh [c] and [e]) has been isolated from Rh (D)-negative red cells that differ from the D protein of Rh (D)-positive cells. Genetic polymorphism may account for the difference.",

Partial D phenotypes arise from nucleotide interchange between the RHCE and the RHD genes or from single mutations. Gene interaction also depends on the position of the genes that ultimately affect the expression of the D antigen. A weak D antigen can also result from the suppressive effect of C in trans position to a D on the opposite chromosome exemplified by CDe/Cde. A weak D individual because of gene interaction has the entire D antigen and can receive D- positive blood. In contrast, weak D individuals who have partial absence of the D should only be transfused with D-negative blood because they can produce anti-D antibodies. The American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) requires that blood donors be screened for weak expression of the D antigen and to be labeled as Rh (D)-positive if the test is positive; however, recipients need not be tested for weak D.",

Serological and DNA techniques differ in the number of alleles that they can identify for each locus. HLA-A, HLA-C, and HLA-B loci have 20, 8, and 30 serologically defined alleles but have 309, 167, and 563 alleles detected by DNA analysis. Among the Class II antigens, the HLA-DR, HLA-DP, and HLA-DQ molecules expressed on the cell membranes are most important with 442, 81, and 127 alleles defined by DNA techniques. The allelic variations of DQ-A, DP-A, and DP-B can only be defined by DNA methods.",

The older list of specificities is based on detection of epitopes by immunological techniques (serology or mixed leukocyte culture reactions) and the newer molecular nomenclature is based on specific nucleotide sequences of alleles using DNA-based methods, now a commonly used technique in HLA-typing laboratories. Peripheral blood lymphocytes express class I antigens and are used for the serological typing of HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C. Class II antigens are typed using B-lymphocytes. Classic serology uses lymphocyte microcytotoxicity tests (by Terasaki) utilizing sera from multiparous women who have been immunized against certain HLA antigens. Clinical molecular techniques have revealed the complexities of both class I and II antigens. For example, the identities of class II antigens can be shown by the mixed lymphocyte reaction but HLA-D identical pairs remain nonreactive using this method. However, molecular typing is able to distinguish serologically indistinguishable but functionally discrete HLA alleles.",

It is highly reproducible (with SSOP) and more robust than other techniques because it does not require viable lymphocytes nor is it influenced by the patient's health. DNA based methods have the added advantage of HLA-typing large numbers of volunteers for donor registries. Furthermore, it can detect the full range of HLA diversity. HLA alleles can specify the HLA proteins that are indistinguishable by serology.

The HLA antigens are also important for solid organ transplantation (i.e., kidney or liver). HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR are considered to be the major transplantation antigens, whereas HLA-C, HLA-DP, and HLA-DQ are generally of minor importance. In kidney transplantation, HLA matching between donor and recipient is done routinely. HLA-matched kidney grafts have better outcomes than unmatched grafts. In contrast to bone marrow transplantation, solid organ transplantation requires ABO-compatible grafts. For logistic reasons, other solid organs (heart, liver, lung, and pancreas) are not routinely matched for HLA-antigens. HLA antibodies play a major role in graft survival and chronic rejection. The presence of cytotoxic HLA antibodies in the serum of transplant recipients reactive against a panel of cells (expressed as panel reactive antibodies or [PRA]) lowers the graft survival rates and may be a contraindication for kidney transplantation.

The unimpressive clinical efficacy may be attributed to rapid postcollection neutrophil apoptosis and inadequate doses (because previous donors did not undergo any stimulation/mobilization). Renewed interest in granulocyte transfusion stems from the availability of G-CSF that not only increases the yield of granulocyte collections but also inhibits neutrophil apoptosis. Currently, granulocyte transfusion has limited indications that include refractory fungal or bacterial infections in neutropenic patients and those with qualitative neutrophil defects. Granulocyte transfusions may also be beneficial to newborns with sepsis, neutrophil counts of less than 3000/ L or a defective marrow response.

It occurs in patients without identifiable antibody detected in the pretransfusion compatibility testing who experience accelerated red cell destruction of the transfused red cells after an interval of 3 to 10 d from transfusion. Such reactions are due to weaker antigen-antibody reactions and may develop over days. Because of the low titer of reactivity, the implicated antibody is not detectable at the time of screening or compatibility testing. The sensitivity of the antibody-screening test is important in preventing DHTRs because insensitive tests will miss weak-reacting antibodies. Note: these weak-reacting antibodies commonly include Rh antibodies (against CEce) and other antibodies in the Kell (anti-K), Kidd (anti-JK a ), and Duffy (anti-Fy a ) blood group systems.",
