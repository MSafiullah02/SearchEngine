            "text": "The COVID-19 outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, because of 'alarming levels' of spread, severity and inaction. 1 As of 25th March 2020, there are over 414 000 cases globally and over 18 400 deaths. 2 The causative novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, is primarily transmitted by respiratory droplet spread and direct contact; moreover, it can also survive in air. 3, 4 Transmission is also possible in asymptomatic carriers. 5 It is therefore crucial that world leaders mount effective public health measures to limit human-tohuman transmission, including hand hygiene, social distancing and self-isolation. 1, 6, 7 Twitter may represent a powerful public health tool for world leaders to rapidly and directly communicate information on COVID-19 to citizens, in addition to more conventional media such as television, radio and newspapers. Twitter is a free microblogging social media website with 152 million registered daily users. 8 Furthermore, over 500 million people visit Twitter per month without logging into an account. 9 The Group of Seven (G7) is an international intergovernmental organization, which comprises the seven most advanced economies in the world according to the International Monetary Fund: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the USA. 10 The European Union (EU) is also an invitee to the G7, represented by the Presidents of the EU Council and EU Commission. The language used by world leaders, such as the G7 heads of state, can influence the opinions and behaviour of citizens. 11 Furthermore, the nature of communication by political leaders affects public policy outcomes. 12 Thus, political leaders can use their influence over public opinion to address public health issues, ideally by disseminating evidence-based public health information. 13 A MEDLINE search for the keywords 'COVID-19' and 'Twitter' delivered no results. Thus, to our knowledge, this qualitative study is the first to evaluate the role of Twitter as used by G7 world leaders in response to COVID-19. 10, 14 Content analysis is performed exclusively for 'viral' tweets, meaning those which rapidly spread across a high number of users. 15 Primary research objective: To explore how G7 world leaders are using Twitter in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Our search strategy replicates a typical search by a member of the public seeking tweets from on the subject of COVID-19, using the keywords 'COVID-19' and 'coronavirus'. This study has determined that the majority of tweets fell within the 'Informative' category. We feel that these 'Informative' tweets, followed by 'Morale-boosting' tweets, are generally more helpful than 'Political' tweets from a public health perspective. Our study has also determined the proportion of non-English tweets by G7 world leaders and highlighted that this language barrier was easily overcome through Twitter's inbuilt Google translate function. 17 We have evaluated the characteristics of viral tweets, including the use of government weblinks and viral videos to share information. Conducting this study highlighted the user-friendly nature of Twitter in searching information on COVID-19, due to concise content (limited to 280 characters per tweet) and the ability to quickly translate non-English tweets where necessary.",

A disproportionately high number of followers were attributed to the Twitter account of US President Donald Trump. This may in part be due to his previous celebrity status through reality television and popular culture. Indeed, musician Justin Bieber has 111 million followers as of 26th March 2020considerably more than the G7 leaders combined. However, our study demonstrated that the number of followers does not necessarily translate into more viral tweets-indeed, highest number of COVID-19 viral tweets were sent from the account of Justin Trudeau, President of Canada. This is because it is not necessary to follow a Twitter account in order to view, like, retweet or comment on a tweet sent from said account. Furthermore, the 19 viral videos embedded within 'Informative' tweets attracted a total of 12.4 million views, indicating that the number of 'likes' alone underestimates the true reach of viral tweets.",

First, this study likely underestimates the true reach of Twitter as these G7 members' tweets could have been viewed without 'liking' them or even needing an account. Furthermore, in-depth analysis of the reach of these tweets is beyond the remit of this study. We also acknowledge that the resulting themes were decided by the first author, albeit he is trained in thematic analysis. Others might apply different terms to certain content. Our study only included tweets with the keywords 'COVID- 19' or 'coronavirus' to maintain a focused search. It is however possible that some relevant tweets were missed if they did not specifically include these words. Our study only included G7 members, on the basis that they represent prominent world leaders across several nations. Further research could evaluate the usage of Twitter by other politicians from different countries. Finally, the threshold of 500 likes to qualify as a viral tweet was an arbitrary one determined a priori in the absence of a strict definition from the literature, albeit it resulted in a good range of data across all included G7 member nations.",
