It should be pointed out that inoculation with higher multiplicities (3 PFU/cell), required for synchronizing the virus growth cycle, caused uncontrollable CPE. including premature detachment of cells from the substrate, so as to mitigate against studies of assembly of the type undertaken here.",

By contrast, in |7C|-| cells, virus production reached somewhat higher maximum levels by 30 h. and then virus production continued at an elevated rate for a much longer period than in L2 cells, beyond the cessation of the experiment 60 h after inoculation. An apparent trough in JHM virus titer, evident in figure 1 at about 40 h. was followed by a second rise in PFUs. which was most likely due to an additional wave of infection. In this connection it should be mentioned that after inoculation with 0.1 PFU/cell. |7C|-| cells undergo minor syncytia formation in foci scattered throughout the monolayer. The individual polykaryocytes did not appear to coalesce into progressively growing syncytia, unlike the situation prevailing in the L2 cell cultures. Furthermore, infected |7C|-| cells remained attached to the substrate for several (3-4) days, whereas the massive L2 cell syncytia became detached within 24 h and lysed in less than 48 h.",

With |7C|-| cells, the small syncytia scattered throughout the monolayers became evident initially within 24 h postinfection and increased to a limited extent by 48 h. In contrast to the cytopathology associated with JHM virus infection of |7C|-| cells, the progressive development of syncytia in monolayers of L2 cells, inoculated at about the same low multiplicity (0.004-0.1 PFU/cell). was much more rapid and extensive [19], involving practically the whole monolayer within 24-36 h.

Absence of ribosomes on the cytoplasmic face of the vacuole membranes implies that these structures are derived from smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). Their random distribution, as ascertained by both vertical and horizontal sections, implies that they occur throughout the cytoplasm. Occurrence of circular, rather than flattened, profiles of the sectioned vacuoles indicates that the SER becomes distended following infection. Virus assembly is confined to these vacuoles (fig. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) and has not been observed at the plasma membrane or any other cellular surface. This is in agreement with other studies of the coronaviruses [2, 24], but at variance with sites of assembly of enveloped viruses from the orthomyxo-, paramyxo-, and rhabdovirus groups [25, 26, 27].",

An associated unit membrane was clearly evident on the external surface and is presumed to represent the viral envelope covered by the peplomers (fig. 6. 9). Elongated structures, which in some images appeared to be tubular in nature, were organized on the cytoplasmic side of the modified vacuolar surface (fig. 3, 4, 5, 6). In the more advanced stages of budding, the virus envelope surrounded the elongated, internal component to a varying degree (fig. 3. 7, 8, 9, 10). In favorable orientations the tubular nature of the internal component could be discerned (fig. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).",

The external diameter of the coronavirus tubules is on the average 9.5 nm, ranging from 8.5 to 10.0 nm. These dimensions correspond to measurements made on the extruded coronavirus helical component, evident by negative staining [29, 30], and on a dense internal thread present within thinly sectioned, infectious avian bronchitis virus [28]. An internal component of greater diameter has been recorded in one study [31]. Our measurements also correspond to the diameter of the influenza virus nucleoprotein, which has a diameter of either 6-9 nm in sectioned virions [28] or 10-15 nm in whole mount preparations [25, 26]. By contrast, the diameter of the helical nucleocapsid of the paramyxoviruses, measuring 15-19 nm [24, 32, 33], is about double the width of the coronavirus cores. According to another recent interpretation, the coronavirus nucleocapsid structure is described as a circular, dense, inner component, about 60 nm in diameter [7]. Our new evidence, coupled with information obtained on disrupted negatively stained 229E virions [29, 31] and on another representative of the group [30], indicate that the architecture of the coronaviruses simulates that of the orthomyxo- and paramyxoviruses, although the coronaviruses, unlike the other two groups, possess a single-stranded RNA genome of the + sense. From this observation it may be concluded that polarity of the RNA genome and helical conformation of the nucleoprotein are not necessarily interrelated.",

On the other hand, rapid syncytiogenesis and cell killing caused in L2 cells by JHM virus might underlie the reduced efficiency in the wrapping and budding assembly sequence, resulting in accumulation of excessive nucleocapsid cores within the cytoplasm. The current observations once again emphasize the importance, evident from our previous studies [19] with cells of neural and other origin, of the host in regulating the coronavirus infectious process, including cytopathology.",
