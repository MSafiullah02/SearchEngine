This paper aims to provoke a rethink and a re-politicisation of the south-Saharan region\u2019s low prioritisation of healthcare in the policy hierarchy by showing how low healthcare expenditure affects economic growth and people\u2019s wellbeing. The paper seeks to show that the neoliberalised underinvestment in sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s healthcare sector is a factor that threatens to derail the region\u2019s capacity to unlock its long-term economic growth potential, thereby inhibiting sustainable economic growth. This provides a paradox within the neoliberal context, which mostly prioritises a \u201cgrowing economy\u201d ideology over the holistic wellbeing of people\u2019s lives. We consider how the introduction of neoliberal policies in African states since the 1970s, through the Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) enforced by the International Monetary Fund, have served to \u201cdeepen and entrench negative impacts on the determinants of health\u201d (Garnham 2017, p. 668) and explore how the rise of neoliberalism has radically affected people\u2019s experiences of engaging with the healthcare sector.",

Bhargava et al. (2001) also posit that it is important that the question interrogating the nexus between healthcare, well-being and economic growth, especially amongst low-income and politically fragile economies, be made more visible in policy and literature. The ideas in this paper are not necessarily nascent; instead, they are a build-up and an addition to Bedir\u2019s (2016) paper which investigated the relationship between healthcare expenditure and economic growth in developing countries. Notwithstanding, our argument is distinct from Bedir\u2019s paper in that it focuses on sub-Saharan Africa and uses time series data from the United Nations (UN) Development Agenda.",

It is, therefore, worrisome that sustainable, long-term economic growth remains elusive for most sub-Saharan African economies. The World Development Indicators show that despite posting relatively high gross domestic product (GDP) growth between 2000 and 2015, averaging 5% per annum (compared to 3.1% between 1990 and 2014), a major drawback to the region, is it\u2019s capacity to create and sustain employment, a rise in household income and dignified standards of living.",

            "text": "Securing sustainable growth is undeniably one of sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s, and indeed the entire globe\u2019s, most urgent needs of the twenty-first century. Over the last decade (2005\u20132015) the decelerating effect of a series of shocks on sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s economic growth momentum has brought to light the region\u2019s vulnerability. As an example, one of the major shake-ups of this decade, alongside the precipitous plunge in global commodity prices, has been the 2013\u20132015 Ebola outbreak, whose wreckage on the region\u2019s economy includes an estimated $2.2 billion loss to the economies of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (WHO 2015; World Bank 2015a, b, c). The impact of Ebola on the three countries could be costed to an aggregate of about 15.4% of their GDP at the time, and an estimated 8% decline in Liberia\u2019s healthcare personnel due to infection (CDC 2016). The net effect of this health catastrophe has been twofold: on one hand, it has been indicative of the degree of unpreparedness of the region\u2019s institutions to mitigate a crisis of the scale and nature of the Ebola outbreak. On the other hand, and more significantly, it has renewed interest in the role of investment in healthcare in driving economic growth in countries. In tabling the Health-Led Growth Hypothesis, Mushkin (1962) argues that the distinct benefit of investing in healthcare lies in the fact that health programs not only increase the quality of the labour force, but also the number of persons available in the labour market through increased wellbeing and a reduction in the number of deaths. Mushkin goes further to state that the number of workers that may be added through health programs is particularly large in non-industrial countries. This suggests that developing economies are poised to benefit more from investment in healthcare relative to their developed counterparts.",

            "text": "The Centre for Global Development (2009) has also stated that the worrisome trend of sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s underinvestment in healthcare is worth considering and revising. To illustrate, between 1995 and 2015, sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s healthcare expenditure (both public and private), as a percentage of the GDP, declined from 6.1 to 5.5%, whilst that of Southeast Asia and the Pacific increased from 1.6 to 3%, and that of South Asia increased from 3.8 to 4.3% (World Health Organization 2014). This indicates that whereas other regions have over time increased the proportion of national income designated for the health sector, sub-Saharan Africa has continued to register a decline. As shown in Fig. 2, in 1995, sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s healthcare expenditure per capita stood at $40.5, compared to $25.5 for Southeast Asia and the Pacific; by 2014, the two regions\u2019 healthcare expenditures per capita stood at $97.6 and $333.9, respectively. This shows that in terms of growth (compounded annual growth rate), Southeast Asia and the Pacific\u2019s expenditure between 1995 and 2014 grew by 14.6%, compared to 4.7% for sub-Saharan Africa. It therefore comes as no surprise that whereas sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 24% of the global disease burden, it accounts for a paltry less-than-one-percent of the world\u2019s health expenditure (World Bank 2008), painting a dire picture of the healthcare funding gap bedevilling the region.",

Globally, the rolling out of neoliberal policies has led to a plethora of harmful socioeconomic consequences, including increased poverty, unemployment, and deterioration of income distribution (Rotarou and Sakellariou 2017; Collins et al. 2015). Hartmann (2016, p. 2145) states that \u201cneoliberalism typically refers to minimal government intervention, laissez-faire market policies, and individualism over collectivism [which] has been adopted by\u2014and pressed upon\u2014the majority of national governments and global development institution.\u201d She further states that \u201cneoliberal policies have contributed to the privatization and individualization of healthcare, resulting in growing health inequalities.\u201d By privatising healthcare, education, electricity, water and housing, neoliberals argue that private institutions are more capable, effective and efficient in providing social services. Harvey (2007) states that neoliberalism is \u201ca theory of political economic practices that proposes that human well-being can best be advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills within an institutional framework characterized by strong private property rights, free markets, \u2026 free trade\u201d and a \u201chands-off\u201d approach from the government. This is what Friedman referred to as the system of \u201cfree market capitalism\u201d (Friedman 2009).

Most sub-Saharan African countries drastically reduced their healthcare budgets following the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Structural Adjustment programs (SAPs) directives. As Hartmann (2016, p. 2146) wrote, it \u201cdecentralized health care decision-making and funding, resulting in wide-scale privatization of health care services, delivery, and insurance, which led to structural segmentation and fragmentation.\u201d SAPs have had myriad negative impacts on African economies, including, but not limited to, \u201cinflationary pressures, the marginalization of the poor in the distribution of educational and health benefits and a reduction in employment\u201d (Rono 2002, p. 84). As the main impetus of the SAPs was to reduce and ration expenditure, structural adjustment in the healthcare sector slashed public spending on primary healthcare, and aided the privatisation of health systems and services. In Kenya, for example, The Bamako Initiative of 1987 anchored cost-sharing as a central tenet of public health policy, in which patients were required to pay for nearly all costs of diagnosis and treatment (Rono 2002). Outside of an emergency, patients were required to provide proof of payment before medical services are availed. By channelling funding to narrow medical interests, structural adjustment policies resulted in an uneven medical landscape, with a few prestigious fields surrounded by poorly resourced departments. Clinicians had to tailor their decisions about treatment to the limited medicine, technologies and resources available.",

The continent, decades after the end of \u201cofficial\u201d British rule, is still trapped in poverty with extreme issues of political conflict and inequality. The colonial system sowed seeds of dependency and low self esteem, conflict and suspicion, greed and individualism, which have made the continent a prime target for neo-colonialism as well as exploitative economic policies guised as freedom of choice, free market and trade (Hilary 2010). Braveman and Gruskin (2003a) argue that \u201cthere is an absence of systematic [policies that foster equity rather than just equality]\u2026between groups with different levels of underlying social advantage/disadvantage\u201d. This means that \u201csocially disadvantaged groups [who statistically] have higher medical needs receive less healthcare and support\u201d (Baker 2010). In fact, a study by Chuma et al. (2012) showed that hospital services in Kenya remain pro-rich and anti-poor. The study showed that there is a significant shift towards privatising healthcare in Kenya, and accessibility to good healthcare is mostly determined by people\u2019s financial capability\u2014which raises more concerns about how the public health system perpetuates social inequality. Chuma et al.\u2019s (2012) study highlights the effects and danger of the \u201cfree-market and trading\u201d concepts and policies promoted by the neoliberal ideology, and shows its capacity to marginalise those who are not able to be competitive in the \u201cfree market\u201d. The irony of the terminology is therefore lost in its definition. They state that the \u201cpoorest population is in greater need of health services than the richest population, and should therefore receive the largest share of health system benefits. \u2026 [However, research] confirms that the poorest Kenyans [with the greatest] health needs, receive the least share of total health system benefits.\u201d",

This self-reinforcing tapestry of challenges affects healthcare infrastructure in ways that lead to a third problem: neoliberalism and the correlation between health infrastructure and donor support, with their increasing push for privatisation of healthcare services. As discussed before, in most low-income sub-Saharan states most of the healthcare infrastructure is provided or complimented by the private sector. The inevitable outcome\u2014which includes increasing privatisation of healthcare\u2014covers the entire scope of the healthcare sector, including laboratories, wards, staffers, pharmacies and theatres, and even research funding. The underfunding and the understaffing of the poor public health sector pushes most patients to the private sector with higher healthcare costs\u2014compared to public healthcare\u2014and in turn lowers family savings and disposable incomes for the affected and or infected families.",

Poor health infrastructure, and the resultant influence of donor support, therefore becomes a geopolitical risk factor predisposing sub-Saharan states to vendor-driven projects (that work in favour of donor states and organisations). The covert as well as overt implication is the pressure on how the funded nations interact with international norms, powerful countries and regional bodies. This particular influence has a negative impact on how poor countries negotiate trade deals with the donor countries, as well as how they vote on issues of national and regional importance.",

            "text": "A mostly negative implication of poor health infrastructure on African economies is that the poor and often inadequate infrastructure necessitates medical tourism. The global medical tourism is a billion-dollar industry involving millions of patients travelling each year to other countries to seek medical treatment (Fetscherin and Stephano 2016; Lunt et al. 2016). Medical tourism has no clear definitions, but it generally refers to the practice of patients leaving their primary residence to travel across the nation or national borders with the core purpose of seeking access to medical treatment and care (Carrera and Bridges 2006; Crooks and Snyder 2011). Medical tourism, often arising due to poor public health infrastructure, not only leads to cash outflows from developing economies, over the long term it also undermines the initiative to build local health systems to cater for those who cannot afford to fly abroad for medication or treatment. Africa\u2019s medical tourism is estimated at $1 billion by World Bank (2015a, b, c) statistics. Technically, the limited existence of essential medical technology as part of health infrastructure causes ripple effects in the local treatments (Gupte and Panjamapirom 2014). Ironically, poor health infrastructure leads to costly charges and medical care that is delayed due to long waiting lists, overworked staffers and inadequate service quality, which in turn push patients to consider medical tourism (Beladi et al. 2015; Fisher and Sood 2014). Given that the majority of African medical tourists seek treatment for chronic diseases, as opposed to cosmetic procedures, this demonstrates the dire need for extra budget allocation and investment in basic health infrastructure across the sub-Saharan region.",

Every year, thousands of doctors and nurses leave the continent in search of better working environments and remuneration. Mills et al. (2011) estimated the loss of returns from this mass emigration of doctors from the nine African Countries they studied to be about $2.17 billion. With 57 countries, Africa suffers from a critical shortage of healthcare workers, documenting a deficit of 2.4 million doctors and nurses (Naicker et al. 2009; Adeyemi et al. 2018). With 2.3 healthcare workers per 1000 people in Africa, African doctors and nurses are overworked, underfunded and overwhelmed (Ntshebe 2010). This is compounded by the fact that, even though Africa carries the biggest portion of the global disease burden while only accounting for 16% of the global population (Roser and Ritchie 2018), it only spends 1% of Total Healthcare Expenditure (THE) on healthcare.",

The institutional disintegration, mismanagement and general limitations of sub-Saharan health systems predisposes the medical professionals to certain push factors that fuel this brain drain, including but not limited to weak health systems, workplace violence, lower remunerations, unclear career paths, lack of protective gear, and nepotism in workplace recruitment and promotion (Oyelere 2007; Renzaho 2007; Soucat 2013).

In the recent past, two factors seem to be colluding to present a fresh and augmented impediment to the realisation of a healthier population in the continent. One, the general slowdown in the growth of healthcare expenditure per capita to an average of 4.9% per annum between 2010 and 2015, compared to 10.8% between 2004 and 2009, is cause for concern. According to the World Health Organization (2015), only five African countries (Zambia, Rwanda, Togo, Madagascar and Botswana) have realised the Abuja Declaration target of designating 15% the aggregate public expenditure to the health sector; this is indicative of the resource constraints that bedevil the health sector. Two, the increasingly inward-looking policy stance by the USA under President Donald Trump presents a new challenge to Africa. In its maiden budget, the Trump administration proposed a 21% slash in foreign aid, year-on-year, to USD 17.9 billion in 2018, and this threatens to create ripple effects throughout Africa. Kenya is Sub-Sahara\u2019s largest recipient of USA foreign aid, for instance, having received USD 823.8 million in 2015 (Concern Worldwide-US, 2018). Of this amount, 57.4% was directed to population policy, reproductive health and basic health, signalling the vulnerability the health sector faces in light of the change in policy stance by the USA\u2014given that donor funding as a percentage of the aggregate health sector\u2019s budget rose from 8% in 1994/1995 to 16% by 2001/2002 (Wamai 2009).",

We see home-grown solutions in select countries offering a glimmer of hope for the future of sustainable intervention healthcare in Africa. In Ethiopia, for instance, the Development Bank of Ethiopia has undertaken to extend tax-free loans (with a ceiling of 70% of new investment) for new investment in the production of pharmaceutical products by local firms. This implies that local firms producing pharmaceutical products now have to invest only 30% of the required capital at the project\u2019s inception, presenting much needed relief to local firms aiming to scale up production capabilities. Kenya\u2019s eHealth Strategy 2011\u20132017, which is a set of interventions anchored principally on emerging trends within the information communication technology space, is doing a great deal to mitigate infrastructural and personnel constraints on delivery of healthcare services.

These emerging trends in healthcare solutions bode well for a continent grappling with resource constrains in meeting healthcare challenges, and suggest that involvement by both state and non-state actors provides the best hope for a sustainable approach.",

We have argued that a healthy workforce facilitates sustainable growth and development in sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed, by drawing from Mushkin theory of human capital we have elucidated how a healthy population is a measurement for social and economic development. A comparison of healthcare expenditure per capita between Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa reveals that whereas the two regions were nearly on par in 1995 for healthcare expenditure, today the former spends three times as much as the latter in this area; a fact that manifests in the overall socioeconomic disparity between the two regions. Many arguments in the literature state that poverty causes poor health. While this is true in most instances, we also add that poor health can also lead to poverty, and can be used as a theoretical and conceptual framework to explain some of the underdevelopment in Africa.",

Poor healthcare infrastructure, when factored as a national security issue, exposes the vulnerability of nation-states to manipulation through the donor funding provided to bridge the funding gap in their respective healthcare sectors. In the longer term, the resultant brain drain following frustrations of the local medical professionals\u2014due to inadequate public infrastructure\u2014disincentivises the development of local healthcare systems while fomenting healthcare systems abroad, which further exacerbates medical tourism and the resultant cash outflows from sub-Saharan states.",

Out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure payments made directly by persons seeking healthcare services either as pre-payment or co-payment, alongside insurance for accessing services, consist of a huge proportion of aggregate healthcare expenditure in sub-Saharan economies, as evidenced by Leive and Xu (2008). This pushes people who are already poor, or surviving paycheck to paycheck, into the brink of extreme poverty, and may significantly impact healthcare-seeking decisions.",
