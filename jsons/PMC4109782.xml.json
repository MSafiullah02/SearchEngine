RAGE was markedly increased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in a dose-dependent manner in direct acid (pH 1.0)-induced ALI [6]. RAGE has been implicated as an early mediator of ALI, similar to other cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 or interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 [6,7]. RAGE is considered a useful indicator of early stage ALI in alveolar epithelial type I cell injury, which correlated with the severity of lung damage [8].

Selective inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibition by a NOS inhibitor was effective in reducing TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and nitrite/nitrate levels in BALF by acid aspiration in rats [10]. Antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment protected the lungs from stress in the first 12 h after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administered intratracheally (IT) and also decreased the mRNA expression of NF-\u03baB, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors [11]. Thus, inhibition of oxidative stress is considered a potential strategy for ameliorating direct lung injury by LPS or acid challenge.",

The dose of GLN was based on previous studies indicating that this dosage of GLN had beneficial immunomodulatory effects [17,18]. Both diets were isonitrogenous and isocaloric. All mice were fed the test diets for 10 days. Finally, 10 mice from the control and GLN groups were sacrificed as unchallenged controls, and then the remainder was given the ALI challenge. After ALI challenge, nine mice in both groups were used for survival rate assessment. Twelve mice in both groups were killed with intraperitoneal injections of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) after 3 h of ALI challenge.

Our previous results indicated that RAGE, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 expression was significantly higher than that of the unchallenged mice at the early stage (3 and 6 h of injury), but all mice died 48 h after ALI challenge (data not shown). Using this severe ALI model, we speculated that GLN could reduce the expression of these cytokines at an early stage, consequently improving the outcome of ALI. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine whether short-term GLN supplementation had a protective effect in the early stages of injury. The dosage of GLN was approximately 0.8 g/kg BW from the feed conversion, a dosage similar to that previously described [25]. As shown in Table 3, enteral GLN administration was safe and did not cause any adverse effects on growth. The survival rate 24 h after ALI challenge was 33% in the GLN group and 11% in the control group (data not shown). The ameliorative effect of GLN supplementation on the survival rate was not complete, which may be a result of more severe injury in this model of ALI induced by two powerful chemicals. A study conducted by Zhou et al. [26] demonstrated that IP LPS injection plus HCl aspiration produced significant lung injury, compared with either LPS injection or HCl instillation alone. Therefore, dietary GLN supplementation had a beneficial effect only within 24 hours after this severe ALI challenge, but in the end could not rescue survival. We will try to modify this severe ALI model by reducing the dose of LPS/acid in next study to further explore the effect of dietary GLN on survival.",

This model of acid and LPS introduced into the trachea led to a direct, chemically induced, tissue-level injury of the lung in such a short time that there was no immediate mounting of an immune response, as is observed in the normal model of septic system injury.

A previous report indicated that HMGB-1 was a late mediator of endotoxin-induced ALI and an early trigger of inflammation in animal models via RAGE activation [27]. Administration of recombinant RAGE could attenuate injury in LPS-induced ALI in mice [7]. Recently, BALF RAGE was considered a sensitive indicator for direct lung injury in acid or LPS-induced ALI in mice, particularly in acid-challenged mice [7]. Yamakawa and colleagues [28] indicated that LPS stimulation resulted in release of RAGE into the media in a dose-dependent manner from cultured rat alveolar epithelial cells, and verified the that proteolysis was primarily caused by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and -13. Therefore, we also measured MMP-3 mRNA in the lung. The GLN diet decreased relative MMP-3 mRNA expression by 30%, but this did not reach statistical difference (data not shown). Confirmation of whether the mechanism by which GLN treatment causes a decrease in RAGE expression is mediated by proteolysis is beyond the scope of this study. According to previous reports, attenuation of RAGE activation led to a decrease in ALI severity. Thus, we suggest that dietary GLN exerted its protective role by decreasing RAGE expression in ALI-challenged mice.",

            "text": "Third, worsening oxidative stress was a possible cause of ALI damage. To determine whether the antioxidant properties of GLN are associated with ALI-induced oxidative stress, we measured GSH and antioxidative enzymes. The lung GSH concentration and mRNA level of \u03b3-glutamyl-cysteine-synthetase (data not shown) were unchanged in the GLN group. Recent experimental data have demonstrated that HSP70 enhancement is the main factor responsible for the beneficial effects of GLN on ALI during sepsis, because GLN is required for HSP generation [15,25,31]. It is unclear whether short-term dietary GLN supplementation is sufficient to generate the level of HSP required for buffering the acid and LPS-induced damage. Therefore, Hsp70 expression warrants further investigation. Interestingly, we found that mice that received GLN supplementation showed a marked reduction in lung COX-2 and NOX-1 mRNA. A previous study showed that lung COX-2 expression and activity were increased in acid-induced injury, and the actual role of COX-2 varied at different stages of injury [32]. NOX-1 has been identified as the major oxidant-generating enzyme in neutrophils and macrophages [33]. A previous report demonstrated that NOX-1 was responsible for more than 90% of the lipid-derived free radicals and was implicated in lung damage in an IT LPS-induced lung injury model in rats [34]. Lung injury and neutrophil infiltration were attenuated in NOX-1 null mice (deficient in the gp91phox and p47phox subunits of Nox) [35,36]. NOX-1 inhibitors have been considered a potential therapy for ALI [34]. Therefore, NOX-1 inhibition might have an additional benefit in GLN-treated mice after ALI challenge.",

Our data showed that 3 h of ALI challenge resulted in significantly higher MPO activity than in unchallenged mice, but no abrogation effect was caused by GLN treatment. It is possible that the selected time point was not appropriate for GLN function, thus the decreased effect on MPO activity was not observed in our study, unlike previous reports [39,40]. On the other hand, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling was believed to be another pathway of acid and LPS-induced ALI other than RAGE expression. In mice treated with adenovirus-mediated siRNA targeting the TLR4 gene, a protective effect was shown against LPS challenge [41]. Thus, whether TLR4 signaling was involved in the beneficial effects of GLN remains to be explored in future studies.",
