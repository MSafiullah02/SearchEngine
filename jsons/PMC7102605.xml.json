It was reported that about 25-27% cases of dilated cardiomyopathy and VMC in young adults and children were caused by CVB3 [2, 3]. Although type-I interferon is reported to have certain therapeutic effect, the treatment or vaccine has been successful in treating CVB3 infection and myocarditis [4, 5].",

Cumulative evidence suggests that LiCl participates in many cellular processes, such as cell gene expression, apoptosis, proliferation, oncogenesis, glycogen synthesis and inflammation. So LiCl has been explored for treating diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and ovarian cancer, as well as antimicrobial infection [7]. Prior investigations have also revealed that LiCl exhibits antiviral effects on certain viruses, e.g., coronavirus, herpes simplex, infectious bronchitis virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and feline calicivirus [[8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]]. Given that there are few reports about the influence of LiCl on the enteroviruses infections and it\u2019s rarely studied to evaluate the antiviral potential of LiCl in viral infection models based on animals, it\u2019s of high significance to examine the effect of LiCl on CVB3 infections and virus-induced viral myocarditis in mice.",

As shown in Fig. 2\nA, a large number of GFP+ cells, which reflect virus replication, were observed upon CVB3-eGFP infection, while LiCl treatment could significantly reduce the number of GFP+ cells. Flow cytometry analysis further confirmed it and revealed that LiCl treatment decreased the GFP fluorescence after CVB3 infection, implying LiCl could inhibit CVB3 replication (Fig. 2B). Next, we measured the caspid protein level of VP-1 by Western blot and viral RNA expression by Q-PCR. These results showed that both viral RNA and VP-1 protein levels were obviously decreased by LiCl treatment (Fig. 2C-D), suggesting LiCl could potentially restrict CVB3 replication in HeLa cells.",

LiCl was applied daily to the mice after infection, after which we analyzed myocarditis and cardiac viral replication. It was found that the bodyweight loss and survival rate of mice were markedly improved in mice treated with LiCl (Fig. 5\nA-B). As expected, the viral RNA level was obviously decreased in hearts of mice after LiCl treatment (Fig. 5C). LiCl treatment also significantly decreased the activity of serum creatine kinase (CK) and echocardiographic measurements showed that the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) were markedly increased after treated with LiCl, which suggested that LiCl could obviously improve the cardiac function (Fig. 5D-E). Consistently, HE staining analysis displayed that control mice showed severe myocarditis with necrotic lesions and inflammation, LiCl treatment significantly alleviated myocarditis with less inflammatory foci and necrosis (Fig. 5F-G). IHC analysis showed that LiCl treatment decreased the expression of cleaved caspase 3 within the myocardium, which further supported that LiCl inhibit virus-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis (Fig. 5H).To further verify the role of LiCl on the inflammation within the myocardium, we analyzed the productions of pro-inflammatory cytokines in hearts by Q-PCR. As shown in Fig. 5E, the levels of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were significantly decreased after LiCl injection while anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was slightly increased with LiCl treatment (Fig. 5I).

GSK3\u03b2 regulates a wide range of cellular functions, including protein translation, cell cycle, development and apoptosis. GSK3\u03b2 regulates apoptosis in a variety of cell types [20, 21]. It is well-known that interferon (IFN) pathway plays a key role on virus replication and GSK3\u03b2 is also reported to regulate IFN-\u03b2 production. However, CVB3 has evolved mechanisms to antagonize the IFN response by directly cleaving MDA5 and MAVS. We also explored the effect of LiCl on IFN production upon CVB3 infection and found that the expression of IFN was not altered by CVB3 infection in HeLa cells and LiCl treatment also did not influence the IFN expression. Besides, we also checked type-I interferon responses in mouse peritoneal macrophages after CVB3 stimulation. We found that IFN-\u03b2 production was induced by CVB3 and inhibited after LiCl treatment, which cannot explain LiCl\u2019s antiviral effect on CVB3 infection. Moreover, it seems that IFN-\u03b2 inhibition induced by LiCl in immune cells also apply to other virus or stimuli. We found similar result in Sendai virus (SeV) infected peritoneal macrophages (data not shown). Wang et.al also reported similar phenotype. They found that, in macrophages, LiCl attenuated IFN-\u03b2 production and IFN regulatory factor 3 activation induced by LPS-, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid-, and SeV, but this is in a glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2-independent manner [22].",

We deeply explore the role of LiCl on viral myocarditis in mouse and revealed that LiCl treatment could markedly restrict virus replication in heart tissues and alleviate the inflammation within the myocardium. Here, we report that LiCl restricts the replication of CVB3 through inhibiting virus-induced cell apoptosis, thus expanding the range of LiCl targets to CVB3. Moreover, we also confirm the antiviral potential of LiCl in hearts of VMC mice and demonstrated that LiCl potently protects mice against CVB3-induced myocarditis, indicating a therapeutic target of LiCl in virus-induced inflammatory diseases.",
