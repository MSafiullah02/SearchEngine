            "text": "Uveitis is one of the most frequent and significant ophthalmic diseases in cats. As discussed in the first article, intraocular inflammation is predominantly triggered by tissue and vascular damage with subsequent release of inflammatory mediators and breakdown of the blood-ocular barrier, so the rich blood supply of the uveal tract makes it a prime target for disease originating elsewhere in the body. It must be remembered that regardless of aetiology, all cases of uveitis are a consequence of the host's immune response that produces most of the intraocular pathology, although some of the intraocular pathology could be caused by the physical injury in the case of trauma-induced uveitis.",

            "text": "The clinical signs of uveitis in cats are similar to those in dogs (see previous article). Uveitis is a painful condition and acute cases may involve blepharospasm, photophobia, squinting and excessive lacrimation. Signs are frequently bilateral, but may be unilateral depending on the aetiology. Conjunctival hyperaemia, corneal oedema, aqueous flare, keratic precipitates (KPs) (Fig. 1 ) (aggregates of inflammatory cells attached to the ventral corneal endothelium) which tend to settle ventrally and therefore need to be carefully looked for behind the third eyelid; and hypopyon (as mentioned later under FIP) are commonly seen. As in dogs, fibrin or red blood cells (hyphaema) may leak into the anterior chamber as a result of the blood ocular barrier breakdown. Iris colour often becomes darker and duller as a result of vascular dilation, neovascularisation of the anterior surface of the iris (rubeosis iridis) (Fig. 2) and/or infiltration of the iris stroma by inflammatory or neoplastic cells: these changes in cats are more easily identified than in dogs, since the feline iris is usually lighter in colour than the canine one. Such infiltrates of inflammatory or neoplastic cells may change iris shape and mobility, while fibrinous exudate may cause the iris to adhere to the lens (posterior synechiae) (Fig. 3 ). In combination with inflammatory cell infiltrates, these synechiae may block the iridocorneal drainage angle resulting in secondary glaucoma. As a result of the action of prostaglandins on the sphincter iris muscle, on uveal outflow and aqueous humour production, miosis, anisocoria and decreased intraocular pressure are also frequent presentations. Inevitably, however, intraocular pressure may also be increased in cats that SMALL develop glaucoma secondary to uveitis. Intermediate uveitis or 'pars planitis' is characterised by a collection of inflammatory cells visible on the posterior lens capsule and/or in the anterior vitreous, often with a 'snow banking' effect. It has been frequently associated with intraocular inflammation secondary to FIV.",

Posterior signs are usually characteristic, although not pathognomonic, with multiple, irregular dark grey lesions on the dorsal tapetum and white spots on the ventral retina, varying greatly in size, and sometimes causing retinal detachment.The second most common ocular sign in feline cryptococcosis is optic neuritis. Microscopically, organisms may be seen (mostly in the choroid, subretinal spaces and vitreous cavity, and rarely in the anterior chamber) with or without associated inflammatory cell infiltrates (macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells and neutrophils).",

This bacterium has been linked to intraocular inflammation in dogs, and even more recently has been reported in association with feline anterior uveitis through identification of antibodies to the organism in the aqueous humor of affected cats. It is likely that a high percentage of the so-called IAU cases may be related to this organism. Unfortunately, since a high percentage of healthy cats are positive to Bartonella (as evidenced by serum antibodies, PCR and blood culture), laboratory investigation is often inconclusive.
