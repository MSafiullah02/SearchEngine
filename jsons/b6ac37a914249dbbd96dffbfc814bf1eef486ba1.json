            "text": "After a decade from the end of the deepest global financial crisis and recession of the post-war period, world growth continues to be slow and even falling in most countries. There is now even the risk that the world could be drifting toward a new global financial crisis and recession. This paper examines the reasons for (1) the slow recovery of the United States after the recent global financial crisis, (2) the United States growing faster than other advanced countries (particularly Europe and Japan), (3) growth slowing in most emerging market economies, and (4) the prospects of the world facing a new global financial crisis. Table 1 shows that at the depth of the recession in 2009, the percentage fall of real GDP among the largest advanced nation ranged from 2.8 for the United States to 5.6 for Germany, and it was 4.5 in the Euro Area as a whole, 2.9 in Canada, 4.3 in the United Kingdom, and 5.4 in Japan. Despite powerful traditional and non-traditional (QE) expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, the recovery from 2010 to 2017 was slow in all advanced nations, averaging 2.1 percent in the United States, 1.3 percent in the EU-19 or Euro Area (which even fell back into recession in 2012 and 2013), 2.0 percent in the United Kingdom, 1.5 percent in Japan, and 2.3 percent in Canada. Britain and Canada fared generally better than the Euro Area and Japan since the end of the crisis, with growth rates comparable to those in the United States. Japan suffered six recessions during the past twenty-five years (including in the ones 2011 and 2014) and was facing a new recession in 2020.",

Fig. 2 shows that the growth of labor productivity and labor force have been smaller drivers of potential U.S. growth since the global financial crisis than in previous decades, and are expected to remain smaller in the next decade -the only exception is the slower growth of labor productivity in the 1974-1981 period. There are, however, some major disagreements on the more basic underlying causes for the slow U.S. growth after the crisis. Supply-siders believe that the slow U.S. growth was the result of low growth of labor productivity, excessive economic regulations, and inadequate social and physical infrastructures. Demand-siders, on the other hand, blame inadequate infrastructure investments and rising income inequalities that dampened private consumption.",

He negotiated a new trade agreement with South Korea, renegotiated NAFTA (now USMCA), and is negotiating a new trade agreement with Japan. Trump also imposed a tariff of 25 percent on U.S. steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on U.S. aluminum imports from many nations. Trump also started a trade war with China by imposing a 25 percent tariff on nearly $370 billion of Chinese exports to the United States (which remained in place despite signing a \"Phase-One\" trade agreement with China in January 2020). This in retaliation for China's large scale and systematic stealing of U.S. intellectual property and in order to bring back some manufacturing to the United States and in the hope of reducing the huge and unsustainable U.S. trade deficit with China (White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, 2018).",

It seems that the bump in growth in 2018 was primarily the result of the tax reform (which caused a sharp increase in the U.S. budget deficit) but this was only temporary, as it now seems that U.S. growth is reverting back to the post-crisis average of about 2.0-2.1 percent per year.",

But why was the Great Recession so deep and the recovery so slow in the United States and other advanced countries? One important reason is that the Great Recession was triggered and accompanied by a banking and financial crisis, and experience indicates (Reinhart & Rogof, 2009 ) that this type of crisis is much more difficult and takes much longer to overcome than a purely economic crisis because it is usually accompanied by heavy deleveraging by the banking sector.

This started before the recent global financial crisis but it rapidly accelerated afterwards. Rising protectionism since the Great Recession, however, caused disruptions in the global supply chains (thus reversing to some extent the globalization process) even before Trump and this slowed down growth in the United States and the rest of the world.",

This was one reason for the decline in China's previous spectacular growth.

In the process, China's demand for primary commodity imports from other emerging markets (especially from Brazil and many African countries) also declined sharply. This caused an even greater growth slowdown in other emerging market economies than the decline resulting from the recession in advanced countries. Table 3 also does not take into consideration the reduction of growth of China and the rest of the world as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) that struck China in December 2019 and spread to many other nation in the beginning of 2020. Of course, if the coronavirus becomes a pandemic, as feared in February 2020 (The New York Times, 2020), there could be a very deep world recession in 2020. As the demand for their primary exports of emerging market economies declined, their currencies sharply depreciated or were devalued, thus making the servicing of their previously accumulated heavy financial debt and dollar borrowings of over $6 trillion by 2018 unsustainable. Emerging market economies also experienced large net financial outflows, which exacerbated their economic problems even more. Brazil faced recession with a decline of real GDP of 3.5 in 2015 and 2016, Russia faced even more economic difficulties as a result also of the wars and the economic sanctions imposed on it, and Argentina and Turkey also faced an economic crisis.",

And it would reduce China's growth by about 1.0 percent, U.S. growth by 0.7 percent, and world growth by 0.6 percent. But if the U.S.-China trade war progresses and intensifies in 2020, the economic harm in terms of the reduction in world growth would be much higher, especially if other nations are also drawn into the trade war.
