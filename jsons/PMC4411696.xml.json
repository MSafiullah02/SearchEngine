Research evidence suggests that sepsis is likely to be due to an interaction of genetic and environmental factors [5-7]. Genetic factors may affect the body\u2019s response to infection caused by microorganisms. Genetic mutation in genes involved in the immune and (or) inflammatory response may contribute to the susceptibility to sepsis [6]. This may explain the clinical variability observed during similar infections. The infection-triggered systemic inflammatory response plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of sepsis [8,9]. The immune response is the first-line response to defense microbial infections. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are essential for triggering the immune response and these include the TLR gene family. These receptors can recognize molecules expressed on the surface of microorganisms, which are called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). It is postulated that SNPs in these receptors may influence their ability to recognize microorganisms [10].",

TLRs have three functional domains within their structures: an ectodomain, which contains multiple leucine-rich repeats (LRR) participating in the recognition and binding of pathogens, a cytoplasmic domain that also spans the membrane and a toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. To date thirteen members of the TLR family have been identified [15]. TLR4 is one of the TLR family members that has been the widely most investigated. The gene encoding for human TLR4 is mapped on chromosome 9q32-33 and includes 3 exons and 2 introns. TLR4 can recognize a variety of pathogens, including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria [16], fungi [17], viruses [18] and protozoa [19]. CD14 is a coreceptor that contributes to TLR-induced cell activation. Upon binding to the microbial ligands, CD14 becomes linked to TLR4 and then, TLR4 can activate downstream signaling transduction pathways, such as the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway. This subsequently mediates the production of cytokines, chemokines and coagulation factors which are involved in the pathological process of inflammation [12,20].",

The differences in genotype and allele frequencies of TLR4 and CD14 were compared among the groups using the \u03c72 test and when appropriate, Fisher\u2019s exact test (two-sided analysis) was used as indicated. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the relative risk conferred by a particular allele and genotype. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium analysis was tested by comparing the detected genotype distribution with the theoretical distribution estimated on the basis of the allele frequencies in the control group (Table 3). The linkage disequilibrium (LD) among SNPs of the TLR4 gene or the CD14 gene was examined by pair-wise comparisons of D\u2019 using Haploview, version 4.1. The haplotypes and their frequencies were estimated based on a Bayesian algorithm using the Phase program [29]. No correction for multiple testing was performed during analysis of the data.

It plays an important role in some immune and inflammatory diseases. Several studies have reported a functional significance of TLR4 gene polymorphisms. Previous studies had reported that two SNPs of the TLR4 gene, which are located in promoter region, could lead to hyporesponsiveness to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [32,33]. The possible involvement of these SNPs in the development of sepsis has been widely reported [17,24,25,34]. However, the distribution of these SNPs is rare in the Chinese [35,36] as well as in the general Asian population. Our results show that frequency of the GC + CC genotype rs11536889, which is located in the 3\u2019-untranslated region, is higher in the sepsis group when compared to the controls. With the present study, there is no evidence that rs10759932, rs7873784, rs12377632, rs1927907 and rs1153879 are associated with susceptibility to sepsis.

[38,39] have shown that GC + CC genotype rs11536889 may be associated with severe gastric atrophy related to Helicobacter pylori infection. Zhou et al. [40] examined whether polymorphisms of the TLRs genes were associated with hepatitis B virus recurrence after liver transplantation. They showed a significant association of one SNP, namely rs11536889, with hepatitis B virus recurrence after liver transplantation. Hepatitis B virus recurrence after liver transplantation was higher than in the patients with the CC genotype when compared to other genotypes. Miedema et al. [41] found that rs11536889 polymorphism may be associated with an increased risk of developing chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Sato et al. [21] investigated whether polymorphisms of rs11536889 were associated with expression or function of TLR4. They found that TLR4 mRNA expression in PBMCs among GG, GC and CC genotypes did not significantly respond to LPS stimulation. However, the TLR4 protein expressed at the cell surface membrane was different. Therefore, it is possible that the G allele of rs11536889 may inhibit translation rather than gene transcription in order to regulate the expression of the TLR4 gene. Meanwhile, this study shows that certain genotypes may affect the release of inflammatory cytokines. As shown by Mansur et al., polymorphism of rs11536889 can affect the clinical outcome of patients with sepsis. In addition, the G allele of rs11536889 may increase the incidence of gram-negative infections [42].",

Previous studies have shown that polymorphisms of CD14 gene are involved with some inflammatory diseases, such as asthma [43], inflammatory bowel disease [44,45], ulcerative colitis [44] and Crohn's disease [46]. Currently, most studies focused on the SNPs which were located within CD14 gene promoter region. Results from previous studies have shown that these SNPs were associated with the prognosis of critically ill patients [47,48]. Studies have shown that genetic polymorphisms of these SNPs can affect CD14 gene expression as well as the level of soluble CD14 in serum [22,23], and that this might be involved with the occurrence of sepsis and the subsequent prognosis of the disease [26,28]. However, these studies are not consistent. One meta-analysis evaluated the associated between CD14 promoter -159C/T polymorphism and the risk of sepsis. The results demonstrated that this SNP is unlikely to be a risk factor for susceptibility to sepsis. Only a weak correlation was found in the Asian population [27]. This study also illustrates the importance of genetic background and environmental factors in establishing whether SNPs may be risk factors for susceptibility to sepsis.",

Compared to the control group, CC genotypes of rs2563298 in the sepsis group were significantly higher and the frequency of C allele in the sepsis group was also significantly higher. By haplotype analysis, it was found that the AG haplotype may be a protective factor to sepsis. Rs2563298 is located in the 3\u2019-untranslated region of the CD14 gene. This study is the first to assess the potential implications of CD14 gene rs2563298 on susceptibility to sepsis. Previous studies suggested that SNPs in the 3\u2019-untranslated region may have an important role in mRNA translation. Liu et al. [49] suggested that CD14 genetic polymorphisms may affect the length of CD14 transcripts or the efficiency protein translation, which could influence the function of CD14 and lead to a dysregulation of the immune response.",
