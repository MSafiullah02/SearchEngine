            "text": "Influenza A viruses are members of the family Orthomyxoviridae with a segmented genome consisting of eight segments encoding at least 11 proteins [6], [7]. They are classified into subtypes based on the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) expressed on viral surfaces [2]. The recent discoveries of H17N10 and H18N11 subtypes in bat have expanded the influenza A viruses into 18 HA subtypes [8], [9]. HA is the main surface antigen and responsible for virus entry and fusion activity [6], [7]. The accumulation of point mutations within the antibody-binding sites of HA is called antigenic drift causing annual epidemics, and the introduction of a HA na\u00efve to humans by a reassortant virus is referred as antigenic shift associated with irregular pandemics [2]. The recent emergence of avian influenza H7N9 in China is a vivid reminder that the danger of influenza pandemics is still imminent [1], [5].",

            "text": "The main defense against influenza epidemics and pandemics is vaccine including seasonal trivalent/quadrivalent inactivated virus (TIV/QIV) vaccine and live attenuated virus vaccine [2]. The inactivated virus vaccine was first introduced more than 60 years ago. Current QIV vaccine consists of a H1N1 strain, a H3N2 strain, B Yamagata, and B Victoria strains are now becoming available [34]. However, the TIV/QIV vaccine has been in need of at least two imperative improvements; one is to overcome its dependence upon chicken eggs for viral propagation, and other to increase its cross-protective immunity (hetero-protection) because the TIV/QIV vaccine provides little protection when there is a gross antigenic mismatch between the vaccine strains and circulating strains [4]. The commercially available trivalent HA subunit (THS) vaccine (\u2018FluBlok\u2019) consisting of three insect-cell-derived full length HAs same as the seasonal TIV vaccine represents the success of overcoming chicken-egg dependence [3], [10], [11]. As for hetero-protection, both TIV and THS vaccines have been largely overlooked that universal vaccines have been developed in other platforms; for example, the hemagglutinin HA2 stalk domain-based vaccine, NP-based DNA vaccine, M2e-based subunit vaccine and cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies [2], [6], [12], [13], [14], [15], [35].",

Weldon et al. showed that a soluble HA (sHA), derived from the H3N2 virus A/Aichi/2/68, was modified at the C-terminus with a GCN4pII trimerization repeat to stabilize the native trimeric structure of HA, and the fusion protein expressed in insect cells elicited significantly higher IgG and HAI titers than unmodified sHA [18]. More recently, Kanekiyo et al. showed that the ectodomain of HA protein was fused to ferritin to form nanoparticles with eight trimeric viral spikes on its surface, and the nanoparticle vaccine improved the potency and breadth of influenza virus immunity [19]. In addition, Li et al. showed that the full-length ectodomain of the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was fused to the foldon domain derived from T4 bacteriophage, and the fusion protein induced a significantly higher titer of neutralizing antibody [21]. The results that H3-TM with higher thermal stability had better hetero-protection than H3-SL provide one more evidence supporting such a plausible correlation [16].",
