PED infection can occur not only in farms with unvaccinated animals, but also in those where they have been vaccinated, the former being at a higher risk of causing epidemics.

Typical PED clinical signs in pigs include watery diarrhea, vomiting, and consequently, loss of bodily fluids, appetite and weight. Reproductive performance of sows is also seriously reduced by PED infection (Sasaki, Kawabata, & Noguchi, 2017) . For example, sows in their first month of pregnancy deliver fewer piglets and have higher abortion rates (Olanratmanee, Kunavongkrit, & Tummaruk, 2010) . Similarly, the number of stillbirth piglets is high in litters of PED-infected sows going into their third or fourth month of pregnancy (Olanratmanee et al., 2010) . Indeed, mortality can be very high among young pigs, as it can reach nearly 100% in newborns (Jung & Saif, 2015; Sueyoshi et al., 1995) and as much as 80% in suckling pigs (Shibata et al., 2000) . Although piglets can survive a PED infection, they experience abnormality and malfunction of the small intestine (Curry, Gibson, et al., 2017) , and reduction of fat, lean, protein, and bone mineral gains ; hence, subsequent growth performance is greatly affected.

Based on this, giving weaning piglets a cell preparation of Enterococcus faecalis, a LAB species, protected them from rotavirus infection (Tsukahara, Nakanishi, Matsubara, Itoh, & Ushida, 2006) .

Kritas et al. observed several benefits conferred by probiotic supplementation, including increased feed consumption and reduced weight loss during lactation in sows. Due to our previous study also partly proving that supplementation with the probiotic (BIO-THREE) improved the feed intake of sows during lactation (Hayakawa et al., 2016) , we believe that similar benefits were conferred to sows in the present study. Although no phylogenetic screening of gut microbes was performed in the present work, we can cautiously but positively speculate that probiotics likely competed with pathogens in the gut and stimulated the immune system of sows, which equipped the animals with more resistance to infections (Kritas & Morrison, 2005) . Our previous study also suggested that probiotics supplementation modified the gut microbiota by inducing an increase in lactobacilli and a decrease in E. coli (Hayakawa et al., 2016) . Peptide-zinc complexes in the probiotic compound used in this study also likely contributed to enhance the immune system of sows, as addition of zinc-oxide to feed was previously shown to help reduce diarrhea incidence and assist in weight gain in pigs (Chai et al., 2014) . Thus, a supply of beneficial bacterial strains and zinc to PED-infected sows likely enhanced their overall health, which permitted them to eat more, better utilizing nutrients from feed, and gaining more weight. Consequently, healthier sows produced more milk ( Figure 3 ) and had higher protein concentrations in milk that improved its quality ( Figure 4) . Therefore, it can be considered that a greater weight gain and a higher milk production were indirect benefits of probiotic compound supplementation (B\u20ac ohmer, Kramer, & Roth-Maier, 2006) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 137, "end": 158, "text": "(Kritas et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 476, "end": 499, "text": "(Hayakawa et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 871, "end": 896, "text": "(Kritas & Morrison, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1059, "end": 1082, "text": "(Hayakawa et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1338, "end": 1357, "text": "(Chai et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1868, "end": 1906, "text": "(B\u20ac ohmer, Kramer, & Roth-Maier, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1622, "end": 1630, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1707, "end": 1716, "text": "Figure 4)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "| DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Vaccines generally cause an immunoprophylactic effect in pregnant sows known as lactogenic immunity (Song et al., 2007) .

Unexpectedly, in the present study probiotic supplementation to sows significantly increased the concentration of IgA and IgG in milk despite the fact that they were unvaccinated. Nonetheless, it has been previously reported that probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus given to pigs acted as adjuvant to vaccination which resulted in enhanced immune cells producing antibodies such as IgA, IgG and IgM (Zhang, Azevedo, Wen, et al., 2008) . Thus, a possible scenario in the present study can be described as follows: probiotic bacteria used re-colonized the gut of sows, which likely stimulated early maturation of gut immunity and fended off infection (Chattha, Roth, & Saif, 2015) , resulting in an increase in the concentration of PED-specific antibodies in whey.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 100, "end": 119, "text": "(Song et al., 2007)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 695, "end": 730, "text": "(Zhang, Azevedo, Wen, et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 945, "end": 974, "text": "(Chattha, Roth, & Saif, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "This plausible scenario is strongly supported by our results (Figure 5c,d) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 61, "end": 74, "text": "(Figure 5c,d)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "| DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "PED infection causes impaired reproductive performance in sows which results in negative productive performance (e.g., mortality)", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "during the development of suckling piglets.
