MSCs have the potential to differentiate into mesodermal cell lineages to involve in adipogenesis, chrondrogenesis, and osteogenesis [13]. MSCs derived from various donors, including rat, mouse, rabbit, or humans, have been transplanted by intravenous (IV), intra-artery (IA), intracerebral (IC), or intracisternal routes into animals, from different time points (hours to months) after induction of stroke, and have shown to improve functional recovery during cerebral ischemia [112]. Following IV and IC injection, MSCs migrate to the ischemic boundary; however, few cells have been shown to survive, and long-term cell engraftment has not been detected with IV administration [96]. Another study stated that only 3 % of administered cells expressed neuronal markers in vivo [15], which argued with the concept that tissue replacement is likely to be a potential mechanism for this strategy. More studies support that trophic factors secreted by the MSCs in response to the local microenvironment stimulate endogenous neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and immunomodulation and further improve functional recovery. Higher levels of BDNF, NT3, and VEGF have been detected in the penumbra region 14 days after human MSC transplantation [5]. Increased VEGF and bFGF drive angiogenesis and facilitate regional blood flow [53]. In addition to secreting trophic factors, MSCs were also detected to influence astrocyte survival and astrocyte-related trophic factor expression after ischemic insult, by activating kinase pathways and protein functions [67]. Up to date, clinical reports also reveal that MSCs significantly improve patients\u2019 functional recovery without adverse side effects, probably through neuronal differentiation or secreting anti-inflammatory as well as neurotrophic factors [11].",

During stroke, HSCs exit from bone marrow, migrate to the brain, adhere to the vascular wall, and cross over the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), mediated by SDF-1/CXCR4 axis or G-CSF. This recruitment of HSCs from BM to stroke-induced lesion area has been employed in clinical protocols, for the creation of ample supply of HSCs for brain repair [10]. Both experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of HSCs-based therapy for ischemic stroke. Intracerebral implantation of CD34+ HSCs promoted angiogenesis and neurogenesis and increased the local cortical blood flow in the ischemic hemisphere in ischemic rats [100] and mice [107]. A small clinical study demonstrated that by autologously IA injection of CD34+ cells into five stroke patients, all patients showed behavior recovery and infarct reduction, suggesting the potential of direct IA infusion of autologous CD34+ selected cells for the treatment of stroke [4].",

In that study they found that these cells could integrate into blood vessels when transplanted into a hind-limb ischemic mouse model [1]. EPCs were usually generated and maintained in bone marrow and could migrate into lesion region to help blood vessel remodeling and repair [71]. Recent studies showed that EPC transplantation could promote cerebral blood flow, reduce infarct volume and neuronal cell death, increase focal angiogenesis and neurogenesis, and improve neurobehavioral recovery after ischemia [26]. Grafted EPCs could either secrete neurotrophic factors, which is supported by the evidence that EPC medium could also promote angiogenesis [144], or differentiate into endothelial cells to replace/repair injured ECs and integrate into endogenous blood vessels, which is detected by histological studies [26]. These results support that EPCs have great therapeutic potential for stroke, most possibly through both directly integrating into blood vessels and secreting trophic factors.",

            "text": "In 2006, Ratajczak\u2019s group first discovered a nonhematopoietic population that expresses neural lineage markers (GFAP, Nestin, Olig1, Olig2, Sox2, and Musashi-1) and resides in the nonhematopoietic CXCR4+/Sca-1+/lin-/CD45- BM mononuclear cell fraction, named as very small embryonic-like cells (VSELs) [90]. The number of circulating VSELs in PB increases in mice after experimental stroke [55] and in stroke patients [89], suggesting that VSELs residing in adult tissues or mobilized into PB are a potent source of adult tissue-derived stem cells that can be used for regenerative medicine, particularly for neural repair after stroke. Ratajczak et al. observed increased gene expression of both pluripotent and NSC markers in PB-borne nucleated cells in stroke patients, resembling what they previously noted in murine stroke model. Further analyses using computer tomography imaging revealed differences in VSEL mobilization between patients with posterior circulation infarcts and patients with partial anterior circulation infarcts [55]. In addition, the observation that murine VSELs are capable of differentiating into neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia further encourages us to use these cells as donor grafts for regeneration of a damaged CNS. However, a limitation for clinical application is the small number of VSELs that could be harvested, requiring ex vivo expansion strategy, especially to generate enough supply of VSELs for stroke therapy in clinical setting.",

These factors include but not limited to time after injury [47], distance from the transplantation site to the lesion site [86], state of the cells transplanted (differentiated or undifferentiated) [59], aging of the cells transplanted [108], host immune response [35], and phagocytic response of host [2].

            "text": "Cell death is initiated even prior to transplantation, explained by two main mechanisms: detachment of cells from adherent surface and the removal of growth factor, during the procedure of trypsinization and suspension. Inhibition of cell adhesion-induced cell death was first reported in 1994 by Frisch and Francis. They found that when epithelial cells were seeded in medium with the addition of soluble peptide-GRGDSP, which prevented cell attachment by blocking integrins, it resulted in increased apoptosis [28]. This kind of cell death is termed anoikis, which can be rescued by culturing cells on ECM-coated surfaces to promote cell adhesion. For example, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells cultured on glass coverslips coated with fibronectin or laminin showed greater viability compared to those cultured on non-coated surfaces [37]. In vitro study demonstrated that addition of laminin to neural progenitor cells increased the number of neurospheres and reduced cell death in comparison to control groups, while blocking the beta 1 integrin inhibited the effect of laminin, suggesting this is beta 1 integrin mediated [32]. One proposed explanation for detachment-induced cell death is that Bmf released from actin in terms of cytoskeleton stabilization is reduced after cell detachment. Bmf binds to Bcl-2 in mitochondria and neutralizes its antiapoptotic effect, which activates caspase-8, further releasing Bcl-2 from the mitochondria to induce cell death [29].",

Typically, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway is activated when trophic support is removed, mediates c-Jun phosphorylation, thus induces the expression of proapoptotic factor-Bcl-2 family (DP5/Hrk). It further demonstrates that DP5 activates a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family-Bax, causes mitochondrial damage, and releases cytochrome c, leading to the formation of apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1)/caspase-9 complex, which activates caspase-3 resulting in cell apoptosis [138].",

It is highly accepted that cerebral ischemia caused excessive ROS would induce the apoptosis of the transplanted cells [12].

Liu et al. found that intravenously administered hMSCs overexpressing PIGF could accumulate in the ischemic lesions, further reduced lesion volume, enhanced angiogenesis, and elicited functional improvement [74]. FGF-2-modified MSCs with HSV-1 greatly reduced infarct volume and improved functional recovery at 14 days after stroke [40]. When surviving, a new apoptosis-inhibiting protein was overexpressed in MSCs and promoted MSCs\u2019 survival by 1.3-fold at 4 days and 3.4-fold higher at 14 days posttransplantation, which results in reduced infarct volume and improved neurological function [76].\n",

Pharmacological agents, including diazoxide [84], can induce protective miRs expression. Besides miRs, a recent investigation elucidated that preconditioning of MSCs with specific cell-free DNAs (cfDNAs) increased cell survival via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB) [54].

In their further study, they loaded VEGF into the PLGA microparticles and transplanted NSCs which were seeded on the VEGF-releasing PLGA particles into the cavity.

Recently, experimental studies from Dr. Thomas Carmichael\u2019s group proved that hydrogel composed of cross-linked hyaluronan and heparin sulfate significantly promoted NPCs\u2019 survival after transplantation into the infarct cavity, accompanied by reduced inflammation [145]. In their further study, they proposed to modify hyaluronic acid hydrogel with cell adhesion peptide RGD and cross-linked with either MMP degradable peptides or non-MMP degradable peptides through a Michael Addition reaction to produce two hydrogel formulations with two different stiffness moduli (300 Pa in MMP HA and 1000 Pa in non-MMP HA). NPCs derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS-NPC) were encapsulated in the hydrogel matrix and delivered to the infarct cavity of stroke mice. They found that hydrogel system with MMP and RGD modification promoted neuronal differentiation of iPS-NPC and induced minimum inflammation [58].",

A detailed analysis of the biological responses to brain injury would not only give us insight into the mechanism of stem cell homing but also give us important clues about how we can improve their homing capacity. Now it is clear that following brain injury, homing molecular cues, including chemokines, growth factors, and adhesion molecules, originating from the inflammatory zone in the injured brain, are activated and upregulated to cause BMSC homing. Chemokines such as G-CSF and SDF-1 have been demonstrated to be an important stem cell homing mediator that mobilizes stem cells from bone marrow into the PB. G-CSF treatment enhances tissue regeneration and improves recovery after stroke by mobilizing BMSCs from bone marrow into peripheral blood [91]. Previous studies showed that subcutaneous injection of G-CSF for 5 days after cerebral ischemia promotes BMSC migration to the lesion area, reduces infarcts, and enhances functional recovery in stroke rats [101]. G-CSF treatment is also demonstrated to facilitate neurogenesis in SVZ by increasing the infiltration of BMSC into the brain [99]. BMSCs exert their benefits on cerebral ischemic injuries through promoting neuronal repair and recovery of brain function, which provides a basis for the development of a noninvasive autologous therapy for cerebral ischemia. Some pilot clinical trials demonstrated that G-CSF could mobilize BMSCs in patients after acute stroke safely and provide better neurological outcome compared to conventional treatment [101].",

SDF-1 and its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 were found upregulated after early focal cerebral ischemia [121] and showed beneficial for the adhesion and migration of BMSCs both to bone marrow and to ischemic tissue through activation of specific integrin molecules. Given that CXCR4 and CXCR7 are present on bone marrow stem cells [14], upregulation of SDF-1 in the local ischemic damage after injury may be related to stem cell homing and engraftment toward the injured tissue. During cerebral ischemia, SDF-1 was found primarily co-localized with endothelial cells and closely interacted with infiltrated BMSCs from bone marrow in the ischemic penumbra region, suggesting that SDF-1 may mediate trafficking of transplanted BMSCs to ischemically damaged tissue. Indeed, overexpression of SDF-1 in ischemic tissues has recently been found to augment EPC-induced vasculogenesis in hind-limb ischemic mice, as well as enhanced recovery of blood perfusion, increased capillary density, and induced partial incorporation of EPCs into the microvessels [129]. Our previous studies have highlighted biphasic function of SDF-1 in stroke mice in a time-dependent manner. One study demonstrated that injection of CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 into ischemic mice during acute phase significantly suppressed inflammatory response and reduced blood\u2013brain barrier disruption via inhibiting leukocyte migration and infiltration [39]; however, another study showed that overexpression of SDF-1 in mice brain during post-acute phase promoted neurovascular recovery, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis through enhancing migration of neural progenitor cells and endothelial cells, while AMD3100 reversed protective effects of SDF-1 [66].",

For instance, PDGF and VEGF are demonstrated to act as chemoattractants to induce migration of MSCs [105]; IL-6, (TGF)-\u03b21, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 stimulate chemotactic migration through matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) secreted by the MSCs [18]. During the transmigration process of MSCs through the vascular endothelium, integrins and adhesion molecules are involved. Based on the fact that MSCs express \u03b14\u03b21 integrin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), it is proposed that MSCs roll along the vascular endothelium may share the same mechanism as white blood cells and HSCs to move through the blood vessels. Indeed, Ip et al. identified that \u03b21 integrins are important for the intramyocardial traffic of MSCs by developing a functional genomics approach [42]. Moreover, the adhesion of rat MSCs to endothelial cells of microvessels is reduced by anti-VCAM-1 antibody [98].",

Experimental studies demonstrated that intracerebral [], intra-arterial, intravenous, and intracisternal injection of MSCs result in reduced infarct volume and enhanced behavioral functional recovery, irrespective of pros and cons existing in each injection method [112]. Intracerebral injection delivers and had the highest cell retention in a desired location compared to other methods [111], but it also induces adverse effects involving seizures and transient motor function impairment given its invasive procedure. Intraventricular transplantation is less invasive but achieves less therapeutic efficacy as intraventricularly injected human NSCs into ischemic rat brain did not show improvement [102]. Intravenous delivery is safer and more feasible, but only few cells could localize to the infarct region [111]. Intra-arterial administration contributes to more cells retaining in the brain than intravenous delivery and is beneficial for behavioral recovery [63]. However, intra-arterial transplantation leads to high mortality (about 40 %) and morbidity due to cell accumulation and microemboli, especially when large-sized stem cells (e.g., MSCs) were transplanted intra-arterially [44], which is a major concern for its clinical translation.",

Several multifunctional nanoprobes with high MR sensitivity are developed by our group to label stem cells and allow us to longitudinally track them after injection by MRI in terms of its high spatial resolution. In one study we labeled MSCs [122] and NSCs [142] with high MR sensitivity fluorescent-magnetite-nanocluster (FMNC) and tracked them by MRI and fluorescent imaging after injection into the contralateral hemisphere of the ischemic mice brain. MSCs were detected to migrate toward the perifocal region of the ipsilateral hemisphere through the corpus callosum. We further developed a trifunctional nanoprobe by adding iodine-125 to superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, which allows us to quantitatively track MSCs injected into the brain by micro-SPECT/CT and MRI. Using this method we found 30 % of intracerebrally grafted MSCs migrated from the injection hemisphere to the lesion area, and intravenously injection induced more than 90 % of MSCs migrated and accumulated in the lung, while no cells were found in the brain (Fig. 9.1) [111]. However, one major limitation of SPIO-based imaging strategy is that survival and dead cells cannot be distinguished. Signals from survival and dead cells are all captured by MRI and micro-SPECT. To resolve this problem, bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is developed and widely used to track the migration and survival of transplanted cells which are modified with a firefly or Renilla luciferase (Luc) enzyme [143]. However, the spatial resolution and the penetration depth of BLI are limited, which hinder its clinical application at current stage.\n",

When NPCs overexpressing GDNF were injected into ischemic rat brain, more cells were found accumulated in the lesion area [49].

Recently, upregulation of homing genes in MSCs under stress conditions including hypoxia has been confirmed, which may be mediated by HIF-1 alpha [24]. It is reported that hypoxia induces CXCR4 and CXCR7 expression in BMSCs via upregulated HIF-1\u03b1 [75], and hypoxia preconditioning enhances migration of MSCs via increased expression of cMet [93], which hints at the possibility that hypoxia preconditioning could enhance mobilization of stem cells to lesion sites in ischemic brain. In addition to hypoxia preconditioning, H2O2 preconditioning could increase the migration of MSCs through upregulation of CXCR4 and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) [65], and pretreatment of HSCs with SDF-1 or dextran sulfate enhances their homing to bone marrow, which is involved in several genes including CXCR4 and MMP-9 [33].",

Early studies have demonstrated that statins increased EPC number and function through activating the Akt/eNOS pathway [22]. Likewise, enhancement of eNOS enhancers improves the stem cell homing. In particular, pretreatment with eNOS enhancers significantly increased the homing of the intravenously infused EPCs or BMCs and led to increased exercise capacity in a hind-limb ischemia model [95].\n",

Kuraitis et al. found encapsulating SDF-1 into alginate microspheres led to increased mobilization of bone marrow-derived CXCR4+ progenitor cells and restoring perfusion to ischemic tissues via neovascularization [56]. Further studies demonstrated hMSCs encapsulated in RGD-modified alginate microspheres are capable of facilitating myocardial repair [135]. Baumann et al. reported that encapsulating SDF-1\u03b1 with starPEG-heparin hydrogels enhanced migration of EPCs in vitro [6]. Lim et al. developed a multifunctional biomaterial comprising injectable gelatin-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (Gtn-HPA) hydrogels and dextran sulfate/chitosan polyelectrolyte complex nanoparticles (PCNs) to carry SDF-1 to promote infiltration of NPCs through MMP-9 [73]. In particular, an interesting study fabricated and optimized a shape-controlled 3D type-I collagen-based microgel platform to modulate SDF-1 expression of hMSCs, and hMSCs embedded in the microgels were shown to induce vascular repair and functional improvement in hind-limb ischemic mouse [116]. Currently, HA is gaining its popularity as a biomaterial for tissue regeneration [62]. By chemically modifying HA with hydroxyethyl methacrylate, controlled release of SDF-1 was achieved after its encapsulation into HA, and enhanced endothelial progenitor cell chemotaxis was identified [79]. It is also reported that loading SDF-1 and angiogenic peptides (Ac-SDKP) to HA-based hydrogel promoted regeneration of cardiac function through increasing stem cell homing and angiogenesis [103].",

Double-emulsion solvent extraction/evaporation is a routine technique to load proteins to biodegradable PLGA microspheres. Using this strategy, Cross et al. loaded SDF-l\u03b1 into PLGA microspheres for releasing SDF-1\u03b1 over 50 days without affecting its bioactivity, and significant migration of MSCs throughout the duration of release from the microspheres was observed [19]. Thevenot and colleagues fabricated PLGA salt-leached scaffolds to carry SDF-1 and implanted in the subcutaneous cavity of Balb/c mice.

A pronounced burst release followed by a period of sustained release was achieved, and MSCs showed migration to SDF-1 in a dose-dependent manner [34].

We and other groups have proposed many strategies such as gene modification, preconditioning treatment, and biomaterial-based method to overcome these limitations. Strategies to improve cell survival and homing would enhance their therapeutic efficacy and strengthen the application potential of stem cell therapy.
