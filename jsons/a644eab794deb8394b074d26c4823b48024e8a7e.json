In the last 10 years, there have been several reports of successful immunisation with a variety of mucosal vector vaccines (Holmgren and Czerkinsky, 2005) . The choice of this route of immunisation is governed by the efficiency of vaccines at different Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT): lymphoid structures associated with the nasopharynx, tonsils, salivary glands, and upper respiratory tract, termed Nasal-Associated Lymphoid Tissues (NALT), the Bronchoepithelium and Lower respiratory Tract (BALT), Gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and male and female genital tracts (Cesta, 2006; Corr et al., 2008) . Each MALT is covered by epithelium containing specialized cells known as follicle-associated epithelium or microfold (M) cells and plays an important role in the maintenance of the mucosal surface barrier and initiation of mucosal immune reactions (Corr et al., 2008) . M cells transport soluble and particulate matter across the mucosal epithelium and perform sampling of luminal antigens; they thus constitute potential inductive sites to stimulate immune responses. Furthermore, mucosal immunisation also induces efficient systemic immune responses and presents less collateral side effects than systemic vaccines. Finally, mucosal immunisation is more easily performed without the need of needles and syringes and thus trained personnel (important feature for mass vaccination programs).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 279, "end": 310, "text": "(Holmgren and Czerkinsky, 2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 731, "end": 744, "text": "(Cesta, 2006;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 745, "end": 763, "text": "Corr et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1014, "end": 1033, "text": "(Corr et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Potential Applications of Mucosal Immunisation"}, {"text": "Recent advances in biotechnology and in the understanding of the immune system have now rendered possible the design of new mucosal delivery systems. Such vehicles include inert systems in which purified antigens or naked DNA are associated in microspheres, liposomes, nanoparticules, immunostimulating complexes as well as live bacterial or viral vector systems (Christensen et al., 2007; Daudel et al., 2007; Hu et al., 2001; Illum and Davis, 2001; Jennings and Bachmann, 2008; Mielcarek et al., 2001; Singh et al., 2008) . Live bacteria and viruses are more immunogenic than inert vectors and thus represent better candidates to induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses against infectious agents. Vaccinia virus and its derivatives are the most frequently used virus vaccines (Moss, 1991; Ulaeto and Hruby, 1994) ; however in the last years, these vectors have been progressively replaced by other poxviruses, such as canary and fowl pox viruses, and by adenoviruses (Beukema et al., 2006; Karkhanis and Ross, 2007; Patterson and Robert-Guroff, 2008) . The live bacterial vectors are either based on attenuated pathogens or on non-pathogenic bacteria (Daudel et al., 2007; Wells and Mercenier, 2008) Table 29 .1). Compared to viruses genomes which are limited in their capacity to encapsulate several foreign DNA, the genomes of live bacterial vectors can harbor many such heterologous genes.

Attenuated pathogen bacteria such as derivatives of Mycobacterium, Salmonella and Bordetella spp. are particularly well adapted to interact with mucosal surfaces that most of them use to initiate the infection process. Unfortunately, these organisms could recover their pathogenic potential and are not totally safe for use in humans, especially in children and immunosuppressed patients (Alexandersen, 1996) . Gram-positive food-grade or commensal bacteria (belonging to commensal flora of the human MALT) constitute an attractive alternative to attenuated pathogenic bacteria (Wells and Mercenier, 2008) . In particular, the food-grade lactic acid bacteria (LAB) such as Lactococcus lactis and certain species of lactobacilli possess a number of properties which make them attractive candidates for the development of mucosal vaccines (Berm\u00fa dez-Humar\u00e1n et al., 2004a) . Indeed, LAB have been used for centuries in the fermentation and preservation of food and they are considered as safe organisms with a GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) status. Moreover, several antigens and/or cytokines have been successfully expressed in LAB, and mucosal . St\u00e5hl et al. (1997) Development of Mucosal Vaccines Based on Lactic Acid Bacteria administration of these genetic engineered LAB has been shown to elicit both systemic and mucosal immunity ( > Table 29 .2). The production of a desired antigen by LAB can, in theory, occur in three different cellular locations: (1) intracellular, this location allows the protein to escape the drastic environmental conditions (such as gastric juices in the stomach after oral administration of the recombinant strain) but it requires cellular lysis for protein delivery; (2) extracellular, this location allows the release of the protein in external medium and thus a direct interaction with environment (food product or the digestive tract); and (3) cell surfaceattached, a cellular location that combines the advantages of the first ones, i.e., interaction between the cell wall-anchored protein and the environment, and protection from proteolysis degradation. In this context, several studies have compared the production of different antigens in LAB using these three localisations and evaluated the subsequent immunological effects (reviewed in Berm\u00fa dez-Humar\u00e1n et al., 2004a; Wells and Mercenier, 2008) . These studies have shown that most of the highest immune responses are obtained with antigens exposed to the surface of LAB.

High production level of heterologous proteins in L. lactis can be achieved using constitutive promoters. However, continuous high-level production of certain proteins, such as cytokines (our observations) could lead to intracellular accumulation or degradation which could be deleterious to the cell. Thereby, to prevent possible negative effects caused by high production, inducible promoters have been developed. In these systems, gene expression can be controlled by an inductor, a repressor or by environmental factors, such as pH, temperature or ion concentrations (Morello et al., 2008) . Today, one of the best characterized expression systems is the NICE (Nisin-Controlled Expression) system (Mierau and Kleerebezem, 2005) . NICE is a system that allows controlled gene expression by addition of nisin, an antimicrobial peptide used as a natural preservative in the food industry. With this versatile system, the level of gene expression can be controlled by the amount of nisin used for the induction and can be up-regulated more than 1,000-fold (Mierau and Kleerebezem, 2005) .

In this context, a family of new vectors which allow heterologous antigens expression in L. lactis either intracellularly, extracellularly or cell wall-attached were designed (Berm\u00fadez-Humar\u00e1n et al., 2003b; Cortes-Perez et al., 2003) . These small vectors, based on the broad-host-range pGK plasmid (Kok et al., 1984) , are composed of cassettes that allow easy exchange of different expression signals and/or genes. Moreover, as these vectors have the capacity to replicate in Gram-positive bacteria (including Bacillus subtilis, L. lactis and Lactobacillus spp.) and Escherichia coli, the procedure of DNA cloning (sometimes laborious in Gram-positive organisms) can be performed in E. coli. Once the recombinant vector is established in this bacterium, it can be transferred to the desired Gram-positive bacterium. Most importantly, these vectors have been used to produce successfully different heterologous antigens in L. lactis (> Table 29 .2). A well illustrated example of the efficiency of our system to produce heterologous antigens is the expression of E7 antigen from human papillomavirus type-16 (HPV-16).

However, before the approval of this clinical study the development of a containment system for the genetically modified L. lactis was necessary. To address safety concerns with the use of IL-10-secreting L. lactis in humans, the chromosomal thymidylate synthase (thyA) gene was replaced by the gene encoding for IL-10 to generate a thymine auxotroph phenotype. Viability of the thyA hIL-10 + strain was reduced by several orders of magnitude in the absence of thymidine or thymine and containment was validated in vivo in pigs (Steidler et al., 2003) . Strikingly, the phase I clinical trial conducted with the thyA hIL10 + strain in patients with Crohn's disease showed that the containment strategy was effective (Braat et al., 2006) . These studies open new doors for the use of recombinant LAB as delivery vehicles in the future. Other exciting applications on the horizon concern the delivery of DNA vaccines using LAB (Chatel et al., 2008) , allergen-specific immunotherapy of allergic diseases (Huibregtse et al., 2007) and anti-infectives molecules such as scFv antibodies and microbiocides (Chang et al., 2003; Chancey et al., 2006; Kr\u00fcger et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2006) .
