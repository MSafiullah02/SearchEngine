            "text": "Most existing controlled terminologies can be characterized as collections of terms that are arranged in a simple list or organized in a hierarchy. These terminologies are useful for standardizing terms and encoding data and are used in many existing information systems. As such, large amounts of data have been recorded using these terminologies. However, they suffer from a number of limitations that make data reuse difficult. Relatively recently, it has been proposed that formal ontological methods can be applied to some of the problems of terminological design. In the application of formal ontological methods, a crucial distinction to be made is the one between concepts (embodiments of knowledge about biomedical reality) and terms (what is used to code patient data at a certain point in time, based on the particular terminology version). Techniques from computer science have historically been used to represent terminologies in computer-based information systems. Ontological engineering is defined as \u201cthe set of activities that concern the ontology development process, the ontology life cycle, and the methodologies, tools and languages for building ontologies\u201d [1]. The AI community has developed methods in the form of languages and reasoning algorithms that can be used to create terminologies that are amenable to computer-based automated reasoning. While ontological engineering has always drawn from different disciplines, more recently there has been an effort to directly incorporate philosophical notions in ontological engineering methods. Formal ontology is defined by Smith as \u201cthe science of what is, of the kinds and structures of objects, properties, events, processes and relations in every area of reality\u201d [2]. As an example of the perceived contributions of formal ontology, its practitioners seek to provide formal meanings of fundamental relations, such as the subsumption (or is-a) relation and the part-of relation as well as to provide guidelines on the proper use of these relations. Furthermore, it is argued that these methods will lead to the creation of terminologies that are of higher quality than many of the currently existing ones.",

There are a number of types of changes that occur in terminologies that can have an effect on the reusability of data that are encoded with these terminologies. For example, when a major name change occurs, the term associated with a code changes so much that the meaning is essentially different, even as the code remains the same. Other types of described changes include simple addition, refinement, deletion due to obsolescence, deletion due to redundancy, minor name change, precoordination, disambiguation, code change, and code reuse\n[3].",

We have also implemented our methodology in a terminology maintenance tool. To evaluate our methodology, we compared two methods for retrieving ICD-9-CM data, based on recall when retrieving data for ICD-9-CM terms whose codes had changed but which had retained their original meaning. Our evaluation is focused on code change, which occurs when the code for a term changes but the term\u2019s meaning remains exactly the same. For example, in the 2005 version of ICD-9-CM, the code for \u201cMeconium aspiration syndrome\u201d is 770.1, but in the 2006 version, its code was changed to 770.10. Recall can be decreased when searching for ICD-9-CM-encoded data because when the code for a term changes, a retrieval method that does not properly manage the code change may miss cases that are encoded with the new code for the term.",

Many relational models have been proposed [11], and each of these models include techniques for representing valid time and transaction time. The Bitemporal Conceptual Data Model, for example, uses timestamps for tuples, corresponding to facts, with values that are sets of (transaction time, valid time) pairs [11]. The presence of a (tt, vt) pair in a timestamp of a tuple means that the current state of the database at time tt records that the fact represented by the tuple is valid at time vt. The disadvantage of this approach is that the size of the database increases very quickly as time passes. An alternative model uses a fixed-length format for tuples [12]. Ts and Te record starting and ending transaction times, while Vs and Ve record starting and ending valid times. The database stays up-to-date without changing things at every clock \u201ctick\u201d; this is made possible by the introduction of the variable now that assume the changing current time value.",

Concepts, however, are usually represented within ontologies, which are much better suited to handling the structures and semantics that are required for concepts and relations. Configuring a database of concept-term relationships to work with an ontology is possible, but it comes at the cost of maintaining separate structures, each with its own set-up and maintenance requirements.

The MED had mappings to the ICD-9-CM terminology, and every time the ICD-9-CM terminology changed, the maintainers of the MED first had to detect changes by comparing text versions of the two versions of ICD-9-CM using the UNIX diff program. Then, they had to analyze and handle the changes so that the mappings would remain valid. In earlier work, we formally described changes in terminologies that included possible reasons (both good and bad) for the changes. Corresponding to these changes were adaptive mechanisms for properly handling the changes in the MED. It was shown that while it was easy enough, with the right tools, to detect surface-level or syntactic changes in terminologies, the problem of determining the semantics of the change (i.e. how has the meaning of the term changed, if at all) was another problem altogether \u2013 one that was more difficult, and ultimately, more important. For the results of syntactic analyses were deceptively simple, and only by doing a semantic analysis would it be possible to prevent the introduction of problems such as term redundancy, term ambiguity, and undetected\nchanges in meanings\nof terms. To be specific, each of these problems would potentially result in a lowering in the quality and usefulness of inferences that could be made based on encoded data. To help in the prevention of these problems, he proposed a classification of terminology changes, alongside a methodology to handle these changes according to a concept-oriented paradigm that adhered to desiderata of controlled terminologies.",

The approach was centered on a formal model of medical concepts largely similar to those used in frame-based and semantic net-based knowledge representation systems. This formal representation in turn allowed Oliver to describe detailed and formal operations to handle the types of changes that we had earlier described [13]. For evaluation, she created a small sample test set based on three existing sources of medical knowledge in one subdomain (rickettsial diseases) and demonstrated evolution of the medical terminology in two divergent directions (one local version and one shared version). Then, a proof-of-concept demonstration was performed by synchronizing the local version with the shared version using a synchronization-support tool which incorporated the CONCORDIA model and a model for change logs that could be disseminated among independent sites.",

Changes may be made to correct spelling errors or to keep up-to-date with naming conventions; they can also be made to make the meaning of a term more explicit. There are two things to consider when this type of change occurs. First, users might search for the concept using either the new term or the old term, so we have to explicitly represent that both terms are (or were) used (during different periods of time) to refer to the same concept. Second, encoded data that are stored after the minor name change will probably be retrieved using the new term, and data that are recorded before the change will be retrieved using the old term. Therefore, whenever a minor name change occurs in the terminology:(1)The relevant ConceptTermRelation instance(s) are changed by entering value(s) for the hasEndDate attribute. Therefore, we are able to retain the old term as well as knowledge of its relations to the concept and the code. We did not allow for this kind of functionality in earlier work [3]. Although in Oliver\u2019s methodology it is possible to retain the old term and its relations to the concept and the code, this kind of knowledge is not represented in the ontology itself. One would have to extract the information from a log of changes in order to accomplish the same task, and there is no straightforward way to keep track without resorting to reification [13].(2)New ConceptTermRelation instance(s) are created with the same values for hasCode.

These modifications are introduced in order to be able to accurately map \u201cNot elsewhere classified\u201d-type terms to the concepts to which they refer without requiring the introduction of artificial \u201cNEC\u201d concepts. The modification is relatively small: we introduced an inheritable attribute to the ConceptTermRelation concept, which can be filled with one of two possible Boolean values (\u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d). When a ConceptTermRelation instance has an inheritable value of true, then the descendants of the concept to which the ConceptTermRelation instance is linked (via the hasConceptTermRelation relation) can inherit the link to that ConceptTermRelation instance. \u201cNot elsewhere classified\u201d-type concepts are not directly represented as a concept in the ontology. Instead, it is through the use of the inheritable attribute in ConceptTermRelation that one is able to handle changes in meaning (semantic drift) of \u201cNot elsewhere classified\u201d-type terms. In those subdomains where a \u201cNot elsewhere classified\u201d-type term is used (e.g. \u201cViral pneumonia due to other virus, not elsewhere classified\u201d), some concept X that corresponds to the root term (\u201cViral pneumonia\u201d or \u201cViral pneumonia, not otherwise specified\u201d) will have at least one ConceptTermRelation instance that has the value \u201ctrue\u201d for its inheritable attribute and whose hasTerm attribute will be the \u201cNot elsewhere classified\u201d-type term (e.g. \u201cViral pneumonia, not elsewhere classified\u201d). After inspecting the start and end datetimes of the ConceptTermRelation instances of the child concepts of concept X, we can determine which of the child concepts of X will inherit a link to inheritable ConceptTermRelation instance(s) at a particular point in time. For the point of time we are interested in (e.g. \u201cMarch 5, 2006\u201d), if the time period of an inheritable \u201cNEC\u201d ConceptTermRelation instance is valid (e.g. \u201cJanuary 1, 2006 \u2013 \u201c), then any concepts that do not have any ConceptTermRelation instances that are valid for that point in time will inherit the link to the inheritable ConceptTermRelation instance. Furthermore, those concepts that are children of concept X that do not have any\nConceptTermRelation instances linked to them (i.e. those concepts without a corresponding term in any version of the terminology) will automatically inherit the links to the inheritable ConceptTermRelation instance. Thus, any changes to the meaning of the \u201cNot elsewhere classified\u201d-type term are automatically handled because the \u201cinheritable\u201d ConceptTermRelation instance serves as a virtual pointer to those concepts that are not referred to by a term in a particular version of the terminology. For example (see Fig. 3\n), let\u2019s say a new term is added (simple addition) in the new version (January 1, 2007) of a terminology and the term\u2019s corresponding concept is a child of concept X. The addition of the new ConceptTermRelation instances (start date January 1, 2007) that are related to the child concept tells us that from January 1st 2007 onwards, the link to the inheritable ConceptTermRelation instance will not be inherited by that child concept. Therefore, no change is needed: the handling of a change in the meaning of an \u201cNEC\u201d-type term is implicit in the representation mechanism.

Furthermore, we have adopted a formal representation of terminology changes that is compatible with the widely-adopted Web Ontology Language (OWL) representation for ontologies. One advantage of an ontology-based approach is that it allows us to handle changes in the terminology in a way that propagates these changes down a class hierarchy correctly (inheritance). This in turn allows for an easier time managing changes in terminologies and incorporating them in a way that does not alter or lose the meaning of existing data. The method also takes into account problems with managing other types of terminology changes that are not solved by simply querying for the class. For example, in major name changes, the meaning of a term associated with the code changes but the code remains the same. Our method allows for the representation and handling of these kinds of changes. SNOMED-CT, as mentioned above, includes a log-style change mechanism that employs the use of the effectiveTime and active fields. These fields are used to handle changes to the ontology itself, and are used in the core ontology files (i.e. Concept, Description, Relationship, Reference Set). There is some overlap with the methods in our model that pertain to changes in the ontology (as opposed to changes in the relation between concepts and terms), but our methods also specifically deal with problems involve the relationship between terms and concepts. SNOMED-CT does include \u201ccross-maps\u201d between the SNOMED-CT ontology and external terminologies such as ICD-9 (and ICD-10 in the future), but the mappings (analogous to the ConceptTermRelation in our model) do not include equivalent attributes that would allow for the kind of change management we describe here [18], [19], [36], [37].",

However, the methodology we have developed has the potential to improve precision, because it takes code reuse into account. Code reuse is a type of terminology change that occurs in ICD-9-CM when the name associated with a code is changed in such a way as to change its meaning (the converse of a code change). Although none of the codes were affected by code reuse, this type of change does occur in ICD-9-CM. If one of the codes had been reused during the study period, a method that did not take into account code reuse would incorrectly retrieve cases coded with that code subsequent to its change in meaning, thereby increasing the number of false positive cases and reducing precision.",

ICD-9-CM-encoded data is ubiquitous, as it is currently a part of reimbursement and reporting requirements, therefore, the results of this study are applicable to a broad range of areas such as quality assurance and clinical research. One limitation of the study is that ICD did not change as drastically as it has in past years, and so we were limited to studying code changes, and the measured difference in performance was relatively small.",

In 2003, although it isn\u2019t a coded term in ICD-9-CM 2003, the ontology already has the concept for \u201cPneumonia due to SARS-associated coronavirus\u201d. Hence, it \u201cinherits\u201d the code \u201c480.8\u201d from its \u201cparent\u201d concept (concept 1). The 2004 version of ICD-9-CM adds the entry for \u201cPneumonia due to SARS-associated coronavirus\u201d, so we create two new instances of ConceptTermRelation for concept 5. Since concept 5 now has its own ConceptTermRelation instances, the code \u201c480.3\u201d overrides the inheritable code \u201c480.8\u201d from the parent concept.

To illustrate this, we extend the example in Fig. 3. In this example, several cases of SARS-associated pneumonia and Hantavirus pneumonia are encoded in 2003 and 2004. Neither of these diseases have their own term and code in ICD-9-CM in 2003, but in 2004, a code and term are added for SARS-associated pneumonia. (1) When retrieving cases of SARS-associated pneumonias, a method that ignores the fact that 480.8 in 2003 will include SARS-associated pneumonias will not retrieve those cases (decreasing recall). In the example above, Cases 1, 3, and 4 will not be retrieved by methods that do not recognize that the meaning of \u201c480.8\u201d(\u201cNEC\u201d) includes these cases encoded in 2003 when 480.8 had a broader definition. Our method incorporates these facts and so is able to retrieve these cases. (2) Invalid comparisons might be made between data encoded as 480.8 in different years. This can happen because data encoded as 480.8 in 2003 will include SARS-associated pneumonias while data encoded as 480.8 in 2004 will not. A na\u00efve assumption that 480.8 in 2003 and 2004 are comparable will not take this into account. Our method can track these differences, and the precision of comparisons across years can be improved by more precise definitions of \u201cNEC\u201d according to the terminology version.",
