The dried roots of I. tinctoria (Radix isatidis) have received great attention for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) (Lin et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2011). The notable pharmacological activity of I. tinctoria is mainly related to phenylpropanoids present in the extracts, particularly flavonoids and lignans (Nguyen et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the phytochemical profile in the field cultivation of I. tinctoria is highly affected by environmental, geographic, and climatic variations, which has resulted in the inconsistent treatment efficacy of this herbal medicine (Chen et al., 2015).",

Generally, flavonoids are thought to be phytoanticipins that can be inducibly synthesized by biotic and abiotic stresses, which can improve plant survival under unfavorable environmental conditions (Fini et al., 2011; Giampieri et al., 2018). Based on this principle, application of external elicitors is likely to boost flavonoid biosynthesis in ITHRCs by inducing plant defense responses. In view of the bio-safety of products, atoxic elicitors should be adopted for the improvement of flavonoid yield in ITHRCs.",

Prior to elicitation experiments, a series of flasks containing ITHRCs (24 day-old) with 150 mL of fresh culture media were placed in a laminar flow cabinet, and the sterile membranes of these flasks were taken off for exposing hairy root cultures to UV radiation. The UV light lamps (UV-A: 40 W, \u03bb\nmax = 365 nm; UV-B: 40 W, \u03bb\nmax = 313 nm; UV-C: 40 W, \u03bb\nmax = 254 nm; Beijing Institute of Electric Light Source, China) were mounted on fixtures at the top of hairy root cultures, and the distance of lamps from cultures was adjusted to obtain a constant radiation intensity (3 W/m2) measured with a DRC-100X photometer (Spectronics, USA). The UV radiation dose (kJ/m2) in this work was calculated by multiplying the fixed output value (3 W/m2) with the exposure duration. During elicitation experiments, three groups of ITHRCs (24 day-old) were individually subjected to UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C with successive time points of 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 15 h, which were equivalent to UV radiation doses of 0, 10.8, 21.6, 43.2, 64.8, 86.4, 97.2, 108, 118.8, 140.4, and 162 kJ/m2, respectively. For control, a group of ITHRCs (24 day-old) underwent the same conditions in the dark. After elicitation experiments, hairy roots were collected, rinsed by distilled water, and divided into three parts: one being dried in a vacuum oven for the liquid-solid extraction of flavonoids, one being handled quickly in fresh state for the evaluation of antioxidant enzyme activity, and one being frozen immediately with liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for the extraction of total RNA.

Generally, plants are able to specifically perceive diverse types of UV photons and trigger different signal transduction pathways, which can induce distinct effects on plant secondary metabolisms, and eventually result in accumulating different levels of secondary metabolites (Matsuura et al., 2013). Additionally, UV radiation dose is a critical parameter that can strongly influence the accumulation of certain secondary metabolites in a specific plant in vitro culture (Schreiner et al., 2016). It is well documented that the mild UV radiation can pre-dispose plant cells/organs to a state of low alert via stimuli-specific signaling pathways, which is beneficial for boosting up the biosynthesis of defense secondary metabolites (Anjum et al., 2017; Hideg et al., 2013; Pandey and Pandey-Rai, 2014). In view of this, an appropriate UV radiation intensity of 3 W/m2 was adopted according to the relevant literatures (Anjum et al., 2017; Pandey and Pandey-Rai, 2014). In this work, the UV radiation dose (kJ/m2) was calculated by multiplying 3 W/m2 with the exposure time.",

As reported previously, ITHRCs cultured at day 24 exhibited the maximum productivity of flavonoids and biomass (Gai et al., 2015). Based on the foregoing, UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C with successive radiation doses of 0\u2013162 kJ/m2 (equivalent to exposure time of 0\u201315 h) were adopted to treat 24 day-old ITHRCs for comprehensively comparing the elicitation effects on flavonoid accumulation on one hand, and in an attempt to further enhance flavonoid production without affecting biomass yield on the other hand.",

And the optimal elicitation effects of UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C were found at radiation doses of 86.4, 108, and 108 kJ/m2, where the flavonoid yield increased 3.69-, 16.51-, and 4.73-fold relative to controls, respectively. As expected, the application of UV treatment was indeed feasible for the augmented production of flavonoids in ITHRCs. Moreover, it is worth noting that UV-B exhibited superiority in elevating flavonoid yield as compared with UV-A and UV-C. The flavonoid yield in ITHRCs challenged by UV-B was observed to increase significantly from 0 to 86.4 kJ/m2, reach its maximum level at 108 kJ/m2, and decrease gradually afterwards. Generally, UV-B is capable of causing two contrary stresses on plant metabolism, which is closely related to the radiation dose (Hideg et al., 2013). In detail, exposure of plants to UV-B radiation under mild dose can lead to the reversible and elastic eustress that contributes to the activation of plant defense secondary metabolisms for self-protection, and when the exposure exceeds a tolerance-limit dose, plants will suffer from the irreversible and plastic distress that results in metabolic damage or plant cell/organ death in extreme cases. As inferred, the optimal UV-B radiation dose (108 kJ/m2) obtained in this work might maintain the balance between eustress and distress in ITHRCs, which is conducive to maximally inducing flavonoid accumulation.",

It is well known that the massive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a common event in plants undergoing UV-B stress, which can cause oxidative damages to various functional macromolecules (nucleic acids, lipids, proteins, etc.) in host plant cells (Hideg et al., 2013). Phenolic hydroxyl-substituted flavonoids have been widely known as effective ROS scavengers, which is ascribed to the reduction potentials of these compounds for locating and neutralizing active oxygen radicals (Agati et al., 2012; Giampieri et al., 2018). Accordingly, it is inferred that the significant augmentation of rutin, quercetin, isorhamnetin, and kaempferol in UV-B treated ITHRCs might be attributed to the multiple hydroxyl groups existing in these compounds that could effectively scavenge the highly toxic ROS.",

Factually, the existence of an efficient antioxidant defense system mainly comprised of antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidant metabolites in higher plants can contribute to detoxifying the detrimental effects of ROS-mediated oxidative stress (Gill and Tuteja, 2010). In this regard, activities of four typical antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, APX, and GR) and antioxidant capacities of non-enzymatic extracts were measured as proxies for the evaluation of oxidative stress in ITHRCs following UV-B treatment.",

Additionally, extracts from UV-B treated ITHRCs showed superiority in antioxidant efficacies determined by DPPH radical-scavenging assay (Fig. 3G) and \u03b2-carotene/linoleic acid bleaching test (Fig. 3H). To be exact, the UV-B elicited samples exhibited better anti-radical activity and lipid peroxidation inhibition capacity, corresponding to lower IC50 values (0.18 mg/mL and 0.22 mg/mL) than those in control (0.43 mg/mL and 0.39 mg/mL), respectively. In this work, the significant increase of total flavonoids, especially the multiple hydroxyl-substituted flavonoids (rutin, quercetin, isorhamnetin, and kaempferol), might contribute to the enhancement in antioxidant activity of UV-B treated samples. Meanwhile, UV-B radiation can stimulate the excessive production of other antioxidant metabolites (ascorbic acid, glutathione, praline, tocopherol, carotenoid, etc.) in plants (Gill and Tuteja, 2010), which might also contribute to the higher antioxidant property of UV-B treated samples. Overall, the enhancement of both antioxidant enzyme activities and non-enzymatic antioxidant properties of extracts was a positive-feedback response to counteract oxidative stress, which provided an indirect evidence of the occurrence of oxidative stress in UV-B treated ITHRCs.",

            "text": "Generally, plant cell wall is an important defense barrier against a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses (Miedes et al., 2014), and ROS formed under stressful conditions can promote cell wall reinforcement (cross-linking of lignin polymers) thus improving plant defense ability conversely (Zhao et al., 2005). Accordingly, FTIR analysis was adopted to compare the functional group modifications of lignin in cell walls between UV-B treated root samples and control. As shown in Fig. 4\nA, the significant enhancement in intensities of lignin characteristic peaks at 1258 cm\u22121 (guaiacyl/syringyl ring and C\u2014O stretching vibration), 1512 cm\u22121 (aromatic skeletal vibration), and 1606 cm\u22121 (symmetric aromatic ring C\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\nC stretching vibration) were observed in UV-B treated sample as compared with the control spectrum. So, it is inferred that the enrichment of lignin in the treated root tissues might be induced by the oxidative stress following UV-B radiation. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that lignin is an aromatic polymer that can provide the strength and density of cell walls (Vanholme et al., 2010). Therefore, the enhanced lignification of cell walls within the treated root samples also suggested an attempt to attenuate UV-B radiation for self-protection. Additionally, SEM examination was applied to compare the morphology structure modifications of samples between UV-B treatment and control. It is clearly observed from Fig. 4B that the surface of control samples possessed abundant branching root hairs with the intact appearance of long unicellular tubes. On the contrary, the root hairs in the surface of UV-B treated sample appeared severely crimped and disrupted (Fig. 4C), which suggested an obvious indication of wound as the destructive consequence of UV-B stress.",

In view of this, the actual occurrence of ROS-mediated oxidative stress and wound event in ITHRCs following UV-B elicitation might contribute to stimulating the transcription of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Therefore, molecular studies should be carried out to further clarify the transcriptional profiles of flavonoid biosynthetic genes in ITHRCs responsive to UV-B elicitation.",

Additionally, it is clearly observed from Fig. 5B that CHS gene exhibited the greatest transcriptional abundance (up to 405.84-fold) at the optimal radiation doses (108 kJ/m2) necessary for the maximal flavonoid production, which indicated that this gene might be more crucial and sensitive for inducing flavonoid biosynthesis in ITHRCs responsive to UV-B elicitation.",

Thus, control of CHS gene expression is an effective way to regulate flavonoid biosynthesis. It was reported that the suppression of CHS gene in tomato using RNAi silencing technology can reduce the total flavonoid levels up to a few percent of wild-type values (Schijlen et al., 2007). Additionally, studies have shown that CHS gene expression is highly influenced by UV and blue light (Jenkins et al., 2001; Wade et al., 2001). Loyall et al. (2000) found that UV-B radiation could up-regulate the expression of CHS gene thus leading to the enhanced accumulation of protective flavonoids in parsley cell cultures. And, oxidative stress was thought to act as a central regulating element in the event of UV-mediated signaling pathway to CHS gene. Similarly, the significant up-regulation of CHS gene in UV-B treated ITHRCs could be ascribed to the actual occurrence of ROS-mediated oxidative stress. Overall, the tremendous induction of CHS transcription here suggested that this gene might play a vital role in flavonoid augmentation in ITHRCs underlying UV-B treatment.",
