Women appear to be affected more than men, and the most commonly affected age group among adults is mid-40s to mid-60s [3]. Older age, smoking, air travel, exposure to changes in atmospheric pressure as with flying or diving, swimming in chlorinated pools, asthma and allergies, dental disease, and immunodeficiency are all considered risk factors for the development of ARS [4]. Direct costs from managing acute and chronic sinusitis are estimated at $11 billion dollars per year in the U.S., not accounting for significant indirect costs attributable to lost work productivity and reduced job effectiveness [5, 6]. Acute rhinosinusitis is the fifth most common diagnosis for which antibiotics are prescribed; thus correct diagnosis of ARS and judicious treatment with antibiotics are particularly important in an age of growing bacterial resistance [7].",

It can be quite difficult for a primary care physician to distinguish between simple upper respiratory infections (URI ), episodes of acute viral rhinosinusitis (AVRS ), and episodes of true bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS). Almost 90% of patients with viral URIs have evidence of AVRS [9]. The most common viruses that cause VRS are rhinovirus, influenza virus, and coronavirus; others include parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and metapneumovirus [10]. Patients with AVRS typically develop symptoms 1\u20134 days after infection. Viruses attach to the nasal epithelium and can spread from the nasal cavity to the paranasal sinuses. Once within the paranasal sinuses, viruses may exert direct toxic effects on mucociliary clearance, and may induce epithelial permeability and hypersecretion from inflammatory cytokines. These alterations lead to the mucosal edema, thickened secretions, and ostial obstruction characteristic of acute rhinosinusitis.\n",

The most common bacteria associated with ABRS are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Microaerophilic streptococci and anaerobic bacteria are commonly identified if the ABRS originates from an odontogenic source. When a sinus culture is positive in a patient with ABRS, a single pathogen is usually found in high concentration, although in approximately 25% of the patients, two pathogens can be found in high concentration [12]. The usefulness and validity of sinus cultures have recently been reconsidered as more is understood about the complex commensal bacterial community comprising the sinus microbiome. However, cultures are still helpful in some clinical situations such as complicated or nosocomial ABRS.",

Maxillary tooth discomfort may be present if the maxillary sinus is involved. Other less specific symptoms can include fever, fatigue, cough, hyposmia, ear pressure, headache, and halitosis. These symptoms apply to both AVRS and ABRS. Therefore, it is not possible for patients nor clinicians to discern a viral from bacterial infection based on symptoms alone. Another diagnostic fallacy is that if nasal drainage is colored it must be from a bacterial infection [2]. To discern AVRS from ABRS, the clinician should focus on the duration and course of the symptoms. Acute viral rhinosinusitis will typically have partial or complete resolution of symptoms by 10 days, with a peak at 3\u20136 days [15]. If symptoms persist beyond 10 days, or if symptoms improve but worsen again within 10 days (\u201cdouble-worsening\u201d), there is a higher likelihood that the patient has ABRS [2].",

Similarly, transillumination of the sinuses to detect an air-fluid level is an insensitive test and not recommended [17]. Examination of the nasal cavity with either anterior rhinoscopy (performed with a handheld otoscope or nasal speculum) or nasal endoscopy (using a flexible or rigid endoscope) may show diffuse mucosal edema, narrowing of the middle meatus, inferior turbinate hypertrophy, and purulence. A complete head and neck examination is important to both confirm the suspected diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis as well as rule out any other possible diagnoses and evaluate for any possible complications.",

            "text": "Orbital complications include preseptal cellulitis, orbital cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess, orbital abscess, and cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis. The Chandler classification, the most common method of characterizing orbital complications, organizes orbital complications in terms of progressive severity (see Fig. 11.1) [18]. Infection in preseptal cellulitis involves the eyelid skin in front of the orbital septum and tarsal plates of the eyelids, while infection in orbital cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess, and orbital abscess involves the orbit. In orbital cellulitis, there is diffuse inflammation of the orbital fat and extraocular muscles. In subperiosteal abscess, there is a collection of pus in the space between the orbital bony wall and periorbita, and in orbital abscess, there is a collection of pus in the orbital fat. It is important to distinguish preseptal cellulitis from orbital infection (cellulitis or abscess), because preseptal infections do not threaten vision while orbital infections do. Patients with preseptal cellulitis will present with lid swelling and redness of the periorbital region but will not have involvement of the orbit (postseptal compartment) so will not have any of the three \u201corbital signs\u201d: impaired extraocular motility, decrease in vision, or proptosis. Patients with orbital cellulitis or abscess will present with similar lid changes, but in addition will have one or more orbital signs as a result inflammation of the extraocular muscles and fat within the orbit. Patients with orbital cellulitis or abscess may also have chemosis (edema of the conjunctiva), pain with eye movement, and/or diplopia. In general, patients with subperiosteal or orbital abscess have more pronounced orbital signs than those with orbital cellulitis. Because most sinogenic orbital abscesses arise from the ethmoid or medial frontal sinuses, the inflammation in the orbit is often most pronounced medially and/or superomedially, and the eye may be displaced inferolaterally. Patients with chronic sinus obstruction with nasal polyps may develop a frontal sinus mucocele that silently erodes the frontal sinus floor (orbital roof); an acute superinfection may cause orbital cellulitis or abscess (Fig. 11.2). Cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis can sometimes be insidious, but advanced cases will be marked by cranial nerve palsies involving III, IV, VI (sometimes also V1 and V2), fever, photophobia, visual loss, and signs of contralateral orbital involvement.\n\n",

An ophthalmologist should be consulted for patients with orbital complications, and consultation with a neurologist or neurosurgeon is usually indicated for patients with CNS complications. Orbital cellulitis or abscess may lead to permanent loss of vision if not appropriately and promptly treated. Neurologic complications may progress rapidly and lead to permanent disability or death if not recognized and treated promptly.
