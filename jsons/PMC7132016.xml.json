Specifically, in these four studies, the proportion of infected patients with increased serum AST levels ranged from 24.1% to 36.6% (Fig. 2).5,13,17,18 In a survey from Zhejiang Province, China, the proportion of patients with increased serum AST levels was only 16.1%, whereas the proportion of those with increased serum ALT levels was not specified.12 It seems likely that the proportion of infected patients with increased serum AST levels in Wuhan (i.e. the area in which the epidemic of COVID-19 started) is much greater than cases reported outside Wuhan. It is plausible to speculate that there may have been a higher viral load of COVID-19 in exposed patients in Wuhan, where the infection began and was concentrated in a greater proportion of the population.",

Some studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 predominantly enters alveolar epithelial cells through the human ACE2 receptor.19,20 Therefore, the lung is considered the main target organ of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, previous studies have found that bile duct epithelial cells may also express ACE2 receptor at a concentration 20 times higher than in hepatocytes and these findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection might also cause bile duct epithelial cell damage.21,22 However, significant increases in circulating levels of serum alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin or gamma-glutamyltransferase (that may reflect bile duct injury) have been rarely reported in COVID-19 patients.9 Liver histopathologic features from COVID-19 patients also did not show any significant damage in hepatocytes or bile duct cells.23 For this reason, it is reasonable to assume that COVID-19-related liver dysfunction is more likely due to secondary liver damage than the use of hepatotoxic therapies or the coexistence of systemic inflammatory response, respiratory distress syndrome-induced hypoxia, or multiple organ dysfunction.",

Most experts believe that the occurrence of multiple organ failure is mainly related to the sudden initiation of an inflammatory \u201cstorm\u201d in the critically ill COVID-19 patients.26 The so-called inflammatory \u201cstorm\u201d, or systemic inflammatory response syndrome, is strongly related to activation of both natural and cellular immunity that is triggered by COVID-19 infection.27 In fact, the virus is able to directly induce multiple proinflammatory signals via toll-like receptors (TLRs) and activation of killer T lymphocytes.28 The activated T lymphocytes then attack the infected body cells, leading to their apoptosis and necrosis, until T lymphocytes are depleted. Damage-related pattern molecules released by dead infected cells can further amplify some inflammatory signals, such as TLRs. At the same time, T-lymphocyte depletion cannot control viral and bacterial infections, thereby activating multiple inflammatory signaling pathways, which lead to macrophage activation and secondary inflammatory reactions. Subsequently, when more inflammatory cytokines are released, more cell damage and necrosis are observed (Fig. 3). Such a vicious cycle is capable of causing multiple injuries, not only to the lungs but also to the liver, heart, and kidneys.",

Experimental data showed that hepatic cell death and inflammatory cell infiltration caused by hypoxia can be seen both in vivo and in vitro models of hepatic ischemia and hypoxia.29 This suggests that oxygen reduction and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes during shock and hypoxic conditions may lead to cell death. The subsequent marked increase in reactive oxygen species and their peroxidation products can act as a second messenger, activating redox-sensitive transcription factors, and further amplifying the release of multiple proinflammatory factors, causing liver damage.30 All the aforementioned findings suggest that pneumonia-associated hypoxia is one of the most important factors causing secondary liver injury in COVID-19 patients.",

For SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, both ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists might be used not only for treating high blood pressure but also for reducing systemic inflammatory response and improving patient mortality.35",

(2) The proportion of infected patients with elevated serum transaminase levels is higher in adults than in children and in men than in women, respectively. However, we suggest that further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary observations. In the meantime, we believe that the front-line medical staff should pay attention to liver function tests in patients infected with COVID-19. For those patients with a pre-existing history of liver diseases (especially older patients), special attention should be paid to monitoring hepatic changes caused by COVID-19, whilst carefully identifying the cause of the liver dysfunction.39 We also recommend that front-line medical staff should assess the use of appropriate hepatoprotective therapies, especially in patients with pre-existing liver disease, in order to attenuate the potentially deleterious impact of COVID-19-related liver damage/dysfunction.",
