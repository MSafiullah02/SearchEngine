Researchers are taking the help of mathematical modeling in order to provide answers to such urgent queries [10]. For instance, to contain the spread, strategies such as social distancing, quarantine and contact tracing of the infected or suspected people, the complete lockdown of the area or countries dealing with it and screening international travelers are the results of model predictions ([19, 43]; Mandal et al. 2019; [11, 63]). Early modeling results by Kucharski et al. based on the stochastic transmission model told about the variation of COVID-19 over a certain period of time, probability of an outbreak in other areas outside Wuhan and observed a decline in reproduction number from 2.35 to 1.05 after the introduction of travel restrictions [24]. In another study by Chen et al. [10], a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model was developed to simulate the probable transmission from bats to human beings. They also simplified the above model and found that majorly the transmission occurred from person to person relying on the reproduction number estimated as 3.58 [43]. Li et al. also provided evidence about the person to person transmission route in Wuhan, China, and the calculated that the number of infections doubled in 7.4 days [27]. Similarly, several other models have been used to access the outbreak characteristics [6, 28, 59]. Moreover, once the vaccine is made available, its effective distribution could be carried out by mathematical modeling, as suggested in the literature for such infections [1]. However, looking at the severity of the pandemic and the rapidly changing numbers of the infected population, it demands constant data analysis.",

            "text": "Time series analysis and forecasting deal with understanding the past relationship among the variables by using various modeling techniques with the ultimate goal of obtaining accurate prediction of future values. Box-Jenkins based ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model is a widely used statistical model in time series analysis, which covers a wide variety of patterns, ranging from stationary to non-stationary and seasonal (periodic) time series [33, 54]. However, in dealing with non-linear situations where data is not a linear function of time, Box-Jenkins methodology is inappropriate [3, 7, 23, 33]. For accurate forecasting of non-linear data, wavelet analysis is a magnificent tool that is capable of diagnosing high-frequency components in time series data [15, 17, 34, 36, 42]. Discreet wavelet transformation involves decomposition of time series at different scales, and each component series can be treated for forecasting purpose [25, 38, 40, 44, [49], [50], [51], 53]. The use of wavelets for forecasting purposes includes the extent of refinement and flexibility, which the traditional methods cannot afford [16, 21, 22, 62, 64].",

ARIMA model is based on the Box-Jenkins Model (1960), which makes use of past values to predict future values of time series. ARIMA modeling approach basically has three phases; model identification, parameter estimation, and diagnostic checking of the model. The model identification stage determines the time series for stationarity and seasonality, which needs to be modeled before parameter estimation. The stationarity of time series can be judged from an autocorrelation function (ACF) plot, and in case of non-stationary time series, differencing transformation can be applied to obtain stationary data. Seasonality can be modeled by taking seasonal differencing and regenerating autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots. These plots are also helpful in identifying the values of parameters p and q [8, 9]. Parameter estimation of the appropriately selected model is made by maximum likelihood, which is a commonly used method for evaluation. Finally, the overall adequacy of the model is checked with the help of the Ljung and Box test so that no further modeling of time series is required (McNeil et al. 2006; [41]).",

Discreet Wavelet decomposition of dataset was combined with an econometric model in order to develop a better hybrid model to forecast future death cases accurately. The forecast obtained by hybrid Wavelet-ARIMA model reduced errors approximately by 50% as compared to ARIMA model. The performance of hybrid model is nearly 80% better than ARIMA model for the countries Italy, Spain and UK whereas it is approximately 50% better for the countries France and USA. Thus, the results showed better performance of hybrid model as compared with ARIMA model and can be used as forecasting technique. The prediction of death cases by this technique can help governments to take preventive measures before any disastrous situation.",
