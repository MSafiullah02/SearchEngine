The recent emergence, host expansion, and spread of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 subtype in Asia has heightened concerns globally, both in regards to mortality of HPAI H5N1 in humans and the potential of a new pandemic. In response, many agencies and organizations have been working collaboratively to develop early detection systems, preparedness plans, and objectives for further research. As a result, there has been a large influx of published information regarding potential risk, surveillance, prevention and control of highly pathogenic avian influenza, particularly in regards to animal to human and subsequent human to human transmission.

Influenza A is responsible for human pandemic outbreaks and seasonal epidemics and influenza B is responsible for increasing cases of seasonal disease. Influenza A viruses are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses with a segmented genome. The eight RNA segments of the genome encode for 11 viral proteins, including the polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2), matrix proteins (M1, M2) and the surface glycoprotiens hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes on the basis of the antigenic properties of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins expressed on the surface of the virion [1] . To date, 16 hemagglutinin and 9 neuraminidase subtypes have been identified and are found in 144 different combinations (e.g., H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, etc.) [2] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 716, "end": 719, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 873, "end": 876, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influenza A Viruses"}, {"text": "The hemagglutinin glycoprotein mediates attachment and entry of the virus by binding to sialic acid receptors on the cell surface [3, 4] . The binding affinity of hemagglutinin to the host sialic acid allows for the host specificity of influenza A. More specifically, avian influenza subtypes prefer to bind to sialic acid linked to galactose by [ -2,3 linkages, which are found on duck intestinal epithelium and poultry and duck respiratory epithelium [5] . Human virus subtypes, H1, H2, and H3, bind to [ -2,6 linkages found in human respiratory epithelium. Swine contain both [ -2,3 and [ -2,6 linkages in their respiratory epithelium allowing for easy co-infec-tion with both human and avian subtypes [6] . This reason has been cited as the likely genesis of novel strains, as in the 1968 H3N2 human pandemic, and has given pigs the designation of a 'mixing vessel' for new strains [7, 8] . To a lesser degree, humans have been found to contain both [ -2,3 and [ -2,6 linkages in their lower respiratory tract and conjunctivae which allows for human infections of avian strains [9] . The hemagglutinin glycoprotein is the main target for immunity by neutralizing antibody. The neuraminidase glycoprotein allows the spread of the virus by cleaving the glycosidic linkages to sialic acid on host cells and the surface of the virus [10] . The virus is then spread in secretions or other bodily fluids. The neuraminidase glycoprotein is a lesser target for immunity by neutralizing antibodies, but is the target site for the antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 130, "end": 133, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 134, "end": 136, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 453, "end": 456, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 705, "end": 708, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 886, "end": 889, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 890, "end": 892, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1082, "end": 1085, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1337, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influenza A Viruses"}, {"text": "In addition to hemagglutinin and neuraminidase classification, influenza A viruses are characterized by their pathogenicity. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is defined by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as any influenza that causes severe disease or death in domestic poultry. HPAI viruses, with very few exceptions, are of the H5 or H7 subtype, but not all H5 and H7 subtypes are HPAI viruses. The potential pathogenicity of H5 and H7 subtypes can be evaluated by sequencing the hemagglutinin gene, since pathogenicity is associated with the presence of multiple basic amino acids at the hemagglutinin cleavage site. A change from a low pathogenic H5 or H7 subtype to a highly pathogenic form may occur upon introduction into poultry and is thought to occur primarily as a result of insertion of basic amino acids in the hemagglutinin cleavage site. Molecular studies have shown that the 1918 human pandemic H1N1 subtype originated as a low pathogenic avian virus in contrast with current human cases of H5N1 worldwide, which are the result of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influenza A Viruses"}, {"text": "Influenza A viruses are highly variable as a result of molecular changes in the RNA segments that occur through a number of mechanisms; the most important of which are point mutation (antigenic drift) and RNA segment reassortment (antigenic shift) [10] . Like other RNA viruses, the influenza A viruses lack proofreading ability, and are, therefore, subject to point mutations [10] . These individual mutations in the viral genome cause minor changes in the antigenic character of virus, with amino acid changes in hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of principal importance. Reassortment occurs when a host cell is infected with two or more influenza A viruses and leads to the creation of a novel subtype containing a new hemagglutinin or neuraminidase that is immunologically distinct from those of the previous circulating strains, as can be seen in pigs, which possess receptors for both the human and avian subtypes [8] . Three major pandemics have occurred in the last century (1918 H1N1, 1957 H2N2, and 1968 H3N2) through reassortment.
