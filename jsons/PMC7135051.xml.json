Hoffman et al report on the development and validation of a method for automatically quantifying sensationalism and comparing this to relevance and scientific quality of news reports. The authors conclude that automated methods can evaluate news records faster, cheaper, and possibly better than humans. From a sample of 163,433 news records mentioning the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 pandemics, the computer model agreed with human assessment of sensationalism for 73% of the reports, and accurately identified relevance in 86% of reports and the quality in 65%. A second article focusses on \u2018Spin\u2019 \u2013 perhaps a somewhat pejorative new term for the well known tendency of authors to \u201coverstate efficacy and/or understate harm\u201d. In this issue, Yavchitz et al report on an intriguing study to classify \u2018spin\u2019 in systematic reviews. They applied a Delphi and Q sort method to establish 39 classification categories [28 in the main text and 210 in the abstract] that fall in one of the following 3 categories; (1) misleading reporting, (2) misleading interpretation, and (3) inappropriate extrapolation. The item judged most egregious was \u201cthe conclusion formulates recommendations for clinical practice not supported by the findings\u201d. They offer this classification of spin to authors, editors and reviewers; this might be used as a question on peer-review forms to reviewers.",

            "text": "The GRADE community and their publications are redefining /updating many of the clinimetric concepts and terminology of the discipline of clinical epidemiology that Feinstein [1] and Sackett [2] established in the 1960-70's. In this issue in a Variance and Dissent pair of articles Antilla et al and Schunemann debate whether the term \u2018conclusiveness\u2019 should be used instead of the term \u2018imprecision\u2019 when assessing the overall \u2018certainty\u2019 or \u2018quality\u2019 of the evidence around an outcome. Schunemann agrees that imprecision as used in GRADE does include both statistical aspects but also clinical judgement in assessing the delta of interest. Schunemann argues that clinical judgement is indeed needed for assessing imprecision both for individual outcomes and even more so when assessing imprecision across the different benefits and harms of a specific PICO question being addressed in a Guideline. Schunemann also discusses the challenges of estimating the delta/effect size [change of interest] needed to calculate the Optimal Information Size; he offers an alternative when data exists by estimating a \u2018Review Information Size\u2019 [RIS] that uses existing synthesized evidence to provide what is termed a \u2018plausible estimate\u2019 of the delta rather than a guestimated \u2018worthwhile\u2019 effect which is challenging to determine, in particular for single outcomes. We look forward to the views of our readers on which of the terms \u2018imprecision\u2019 or \u2018conclusiveness\u2019 are preferred by clinical epidemiologists, and consensus on how each is defined and applied. This needs to be differentiated from the separate debate within the Cochrane Collaboration as to when to use final \u2018conclusions\u2019 vs \u2018recommendations\u2019; currently the guidance is to use the term \u2018conclusion\u2019 on the basis of the data -and to avoid the word \u2018recommendation\u2019 since the latter needs to be within the local context and available resources.",

There was up to 30% underreporting when only one of these sources was used and demonstrated that the data linkage was feasible and accurate. In contrast, Moore et al demonstrate how data linkage can go wrong. They undertook both a deterministic and probabilistic linkage within a statewide administrative hospital registry compared to two cohorts of, HIV-negative (HIV-ve) and HIV-positive (HIV\u00feve) gay and bisexual men (GBM) recruited to formal studies. They found serious underestimation of hospitalisations with the probabilistic linkage and call for insisting on demonstration of adequate sensitivity and specificity of the data linkage method before being used.",

In this issue Sautenet et al report that with renoprotection trials an excess of poorly validated different outcome instruments across 20 outcome domains were found. Most studies only reported on 2 or 3 of these 20 outcome domains; only 5 (8%] of these 66 systematic reviews reported on patient reported outcomes.
