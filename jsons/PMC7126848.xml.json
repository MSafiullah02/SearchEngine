            "text": "Nearly 30 years ago, Calvin Schwabe referred to the dynamic state of flux and new discovery that has always characterised studies on zoonoses (Schwabe, 1984). This statement still holds true today, although the emphasis has been on the emergence of infectious diseases from wildlife that threaten human health and the role of wildlife as originators of the infectious agents (Polley, 2005, Jones et al., 2008, Rhyan and Spraker, 2010, Plowright et al., 2011, Wood et al., 2012, Kooriyama et al., 2013). As such, models fail to include spillover from humans to wildlife (e.g., Lloyd-Smith et al., 2009). This is understandable but at the same time unfortunate as it tends to cloud the broader issues which, in theory, make up the so-called \u2018One Health\u2019 triad (Fig. 1\n). Diseases of human and domestic animal origin do infect wildlife (Thompson et al., 2009, Thompson et al., 2010a, Salyer et al., 2012, Kooriyama et al., 2013). However, in practice the balance is often skewed towards demonstrating the \u2018source\u2019 of \u2018new\u2019 human diseases rather than determining \u2018why\u2019 in terms of One Health. As such, we need to better understand the factors that enable zoonotic transmission to humans from wildlife, and which may lead to outbreaks of disease. Is it purely a question of spillover from wildlife to humans, or are wildlife reservoirs resulting from spillover from a non-wildlife source? The impact of spillover of \u2018human\u2019 parasites to na\u00efve species of wildlife is another emerging threat that is not well understood yet such spillovers are likely to increase in the future, establishing novel spill-back reservoirs of potential public health and economic significance, as well as threatening wildlife (Thompson et al., 2009, Thompson et al., 2010a).",

There is a pronounced lack of knowledge about pathogen diversity and susceptibility in wildlife (MacPhee and Greenwood, 2013). Without improved and ongoing surveillance of wildlife hosts (Polley, 2005), not only will we always be behind in terms of predicting the possibility of reservoirs being established and/or outbreaks occurring, but also at a disadvantage in preventing declines of native fauna resulting from infectious disease and understanding the circumstances promoting an infection to a disease state. Much of the information on wildlife parasites has been obtained opportunistically, often at the level of individual animals. Furthermore, all extinction and many population decline studies are retrospective and this lack of knowledge affects our understanding of parasites that effect wildlife (MacPhee and Greenwood, 2013, Wayne et al., 2013a, Wayne et al., 2013b).",

Generalisations made in the context of these emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are often not applicable to the broad range of other infectious zoonotic agents, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In this respect, a consideration of parasite zoonoses caused by protozoa, helminths and arthropods is timely considering the diversity of the life cycle patterns and modes of transmission. In addition, considerations related to EIDs have often been reactionary (understandable due to the serious nature and rapid spread of viral diseases) with little consideration given to the ecology of the causative factors, such as the impact of biodiversity loss, human encroachment, the role of invasive species, and of course the conservation issues.",

The disease is difficult to treat and the few drugs that are available are often toxic (Keenan et al., 2013). The causative agent is T. cruzi, a vector-borne stercorarian trypanosome that exhibits pronounced genetic diversity reflected in differences in host specificity of both the vector and a large range of wildlife hosts (Zingales et al., 2012). In terms of zoonotic transmission, T. cruzi has established several cycles of transmission involving numerous sylvatic, peridomestic and domestic triatomid insect vectors. It is thought that humans would have first been exposed to T. cruzi when they migrated to the New World approximately 30,000 years ago and first came into contact with the arthropod vectors of the parasite (Hamilton et al., 2012).",

This is usually associated with socioeconomic factors, changes in land use and poor living conditions that provide suitable resting sites for vectors, plus close proximity to wildlife habitats which provide the reservoirs of T. cruzi infection (Acha and Szyfres, 2003, Karesh et al., 2012). Improved housing would thus do much to lower the incidence of Chagas disease in endemic regions by reducing exposure to the vectors. A recent study in Columbia has also found evidence that domestic dogs are susceptible to infection with genotypes of T. cruzi normally associated with sylvatic transmission (Ramirez et al., 2013). These authors therefore consider that dogs provide a link between domestic and wildlife cycles of transmission.",

This is a particular problem in parts of the USA where triatomid vectors occur and local transmission is possible with wild rodents acting as reservoirs, often of multiple strains (Charles et al., 2013). The major problem in non-endemic regions is a lack of awareness among the medical profession of a chronic disease, usually with a late onset of symptoms that are often vague and non-specific (WHO, 2011, and see Section 4.1.1). It is therefore important for authorities in non-endemic regions to recognise the importance of raising awareness among the medical profession and evaluating the potential for local transmission, whether this is through vectors or directly in blood transfusions (WHO, 2011).",

In the past, zoonotic transmission was associated with occupational activities such as fox trapping (Schantz et al., 1995) but over the last two decades it has emerged as a major urban zoonosis as a consequence of various human activities (Table 1) and exacerbated by the fox, to a lesser extent the coyote and the arvicolid rodent intermediate hosts as very successful urban adaptors (Deplazes et al., 2004, Romig et al., 2006, Catalano et al., 2012). Another urban adaptor, the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), which is invading western Europe from the east, is an excellent definitive host for E. multilocularis, comparable to the fox (Kapel et al., 2006, Thompson et al., 2006a), but its future role in transmission is uncertain given differences in the ecology of foxes and raccoon dogs (Bru\u017einskait\u0117-Schmidhalter et al., 2012).",

Since the 1980s the autochthonous presence of E. multilocularis has been reported in 17 European countries that were previously considered non-endemic (Davidson et al., 2012). In other areas of the world such as the Circumpolar North/Arctic, the public health significance of the parasite is an emerging issue in villages and communities since once infection spills over from infected wildlife, free roaming domestic dogs with access to stable and abundant populations of intermediate hosts are an effective definitive host and the main source of human infection (Davidson et al., 2012, Jenkins et al., 2013).",

            "text": "The situation is exacerbated by the limitations of current detection procedures used for meat inspection. This is an emerging, politically driven issue as market forces become more competitive and demanding with respect to demonstrating pigs are Trichinella-free. For example, in the UK there is a perceived need for data gathering and assessment of Trichinella in UK wildlife even though it has rarely been detected in the past (Zimmer et al., 2009). However, although there is increasing awareness that wildlife, particularly rats, can serve as reservoirs of infection for pig producers, particularly in free-ranging situations, surveillance capability is limited by the lack of diagnostic sensitivity of current meat inspection procedures (Newell et al., 2010, van der Giessen et al., 2013). Pig farms need to show negligible risk of their animals becoming infected from wildlife. Similarly in Australia, the main concern regarding Trichinella is the ability of wildlife to become reservoirs and thus synanthropes and adaptors to be sources of infection for domestic animals and humans (AWHN, 2011) yet few surveys have been undertaken. Wildlife surveys are considered essential to truly determine the presence or absence of Trichinella but surveys in high-risk regions of incursion are largely lacking on the mainland of Australia (Cuttell et al., 2012). However, a recent research survey led to the first report of Trichinella papuae in a wild pig from an Australian island in the Torres Strait (Cuttell et al., 2012), a parasite not only infective to other mammals, including humans, but also to crocodiles (Pozio et al., 2009).",

This appears to be the case even in presumed pristine habitats such as the Canadian Arctic where muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) have been found to be infected with two species of zoonotic Giardia, Giardia duodenalis and Giardia enterica (Kutz et al., 2008). Human infection is endemic in some communities in the area (Kutz et al., 2009; Hotez, 2010). It is thought that people introduced the Giardia and contaminated the ecosystem shared with muskoxen and as a result Giardia is now maintained in a sylvatic cycle in muskoxen and possibly cervids (Kutz et al., 2009, Jenkins et al., 2013). Thus a wildlife reservoir for human infection may have been established. The impact of infection on muskoxen, presumably a na\u00efve host, and the consequences of coinfection with other parasites is not understood but should, as with other parasite systems (Johnson and Hoverman, 2012), form the basis for future studies.",

With the introduction and domestication of livestock in Africa, E. granulosus has become widespread in domestic livestock including sheep, cattle and goats, with Echinococcus intermedius also occurring in camels (Huttner et al., 2009, Addy et al., 2012). Over 18 species of wild herbivores from different parts of southern, central and eastern Africa have been found to be infected with hydatid cysts (Macpherson, 1983). These include the most common prey species of the lion (reviewed in Schantz et al., 1995) but without molecular characterisation of isolates from intermediate hosts it is not possible to determine the extent of transmission cycles of E. felidis in African wildlife. The existence of an independent cycle in wild mammals in Africa has been proposed (Macpherson et al., 1983, Rausch, 1986). This is supported on ecological grounds and if the lion is the principal definitive host, E. felidis is the species most likely to be involved since apart from hyaenas there is no evidence canids are susceptible to this species of Echinococcus. Molecular epidemiological studies are required to determine the species of Echinococcus in wild ungulates in Africa (Huttner et al., 2009). If it is E. granulosus then perhaps it has displaced the genetically closely related (Saarma et al., 2009) E. felidis over time, with E. felidis now confined to a lion warthog cycle.",

There is no evidence of an indigenous species of Echinococcus or that E. granulosus was present in Australia before the arrival of European settlers, with whom E. granulosus was introduced in sheep (Thompson et al., 2010a). Indigenous macropodid marsupials are highly susceptible to infection with the cystic stage of E. granulosus and are commonly infected throughout the mainland in a wild animal cycle with the dingo as the definitive host. Cystic infection may seriously impair respiratory function and thus enhance predation of infected marsupials, particularly small species of wallabies (Barnes et al., 2007). This is thus a serious conservation issue. In addition, this artificial, man-made cycle, makes it very difficult to control or eradicate infection in sheep on the mainland of Australia due to infected dingoes contaminating sheep pasture (Jenkins et al., 2005).",

Human factors leading to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as translocation of raccoons, are the main drivers (Page, 2013). The low host specificity for paratenic hosts and the pathogenic potential of the migratory larval parasite is considered to be a potential contributor to the extinction of vulnerable species of wildlife (Page, 2013). As such, B. procyonis is considered to have contributed to local declines and extinctions of the Allegheny woodrat (Neotoma magister) (LoGiudice, 2006). Endangered Allegheny woodrats became infected with Baylisascaris when translocated into contaminated environments (LoGiudice, 2003). A recent intervention using anthelmintic baits was shown to facilitate woodrat recovery (Smyser et al., 2013). Other wildlife species are also thought to be at risk and not just in the USA, but also in Europe and Japan where raccoons have been introduced (Bauer, 2013, Page, 2013).",

In addition, as more isolates from wildlife are characterised genetically using multiple loci, what is also apparent is the great genetic diversity of Toxoplasma in wildlife and the occurrence of novel genotypes which differ from the \u2018standard\u2019 domestic strains (Ajzenberg et al., 2004, Wendte et al., 2011, Pan et al., 2012).

Available evidence would suggest that they are largely avirulent in natural ecosystems (Thompson et al., 2010a, Pan et al., 2012). Toxoplasma is prevalent in wildlife ecosystems and exhibits a high level of genetic variation. Large-scale die offs have not been reported and most cases of clinical disease in wildlife are in captive animals (Thompson et al., 2010a). This may be as a result of stress and/or exposure of immunologically na\u00efve animals to \u2018domestic\u2019 strains of Toxoplasma to which they have not previously been exposed. Interestingly, it has been proposed that biodiversity loss in wildlife populations may promote disease occurrence and heightened virulence of infectious agents that are characterised by having high genetic diversity (Johnson and Hoverman, 2012; Bolzoni et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2013). This may well apply to Toxoplasma in wildlife ecosystems. Novel wildlife strains isolated from Australian native wildlife have proved to be avirulent in experimentally infected mice (Parameswaran et al., 2010). However, the novel Type X strain caused severe disease in stranded sea otters in California (Miller et al., 2008). Wild felid hosts in the same area were demonstrated to be infected with the same strain of Toxoplasma and it has been proposed that run-off resulted in coastal contamination with the exposure of filter feeding shellfish from which the sea otters became infected (Miller et al., 2008). However, it is not known whether this strain is normally perpetuated in wildlife cycles and/or whether the sea otters were immunologically compromised due to environmental stressors that have yet to be identified.",

However, in other environments it is difficult to understand how environmental contamination can be the sole source of infection in wildlife ecosystems. This is certainly the case in arid areas where felid hosts are not common, for example in parts of Australia where high levels of infection occur in native marsupials (Pan et al., 2012). Under such circumstances, the maintenance of infection by vertical transmission cannot be dismissed in the face of mounting epidemiological evidence from both wild and domestic ecosystems (Hide et al., 2009, Parameswaran et al., 2009).",

(Rose et al., 2004, Dougall et al., 2009, Dougall et al., 2011), raises critical issues with respect to the zoonotic transmission of Leishmania spp. in Australia. Australia has always been considered to be non-endemic for Leishmania and the parasite a minimal biosecurity risk in terms of establishment. The regular introduction of zoonotic pathogenic species of Leishmania such as Leishmania infantum in tourists, army personnel and migrants, as well as domestic dogs (Thompson et al., 2010a, Anon, 2011), raises the possibility of transmission to wild or domestic hosts via midges. More importantly, the fact that macropodids are susceptible to infection with their own species of Leishmania means they could be susceptible to infection with exotic, introduced species which could cause disease and/or establish reservoirs of zoonotic infection.",

However, the question of local vectorial transmission has been raised by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2011) due to the increasing numbers of people with chronic Chagas disease migrating to non-endemic countries, including Australia (Coura and Vinas, 2010). Little research has been undertaken in Australia on the host range of triatomes nor whether any bite and feed on the blood of mammals, although Triatoma leopoldi is thought to occur in northern Australia and is a vector of T. cruzi in South America (Monteith, 1974, Thompson et al., 2010a). However, recent research on trypanosomes in Australian native mammals has demonstrated that they are frequently infected with a diversity of species and genotypes of Trypanosoma, some of which are genetically very closely related to T. cruzi (Smith et al., 2008, Averis et al., 2009, Botero et al., 2013, Thompson et al., 2013). Importantly, a detailed investigation of the host\u2013parasite relationship in one species of Australian marsupial, the brush-tailed bettong (Bettongia penicillata), which is presently undergoing a rapid population decline (Wayne et al., 2013a), has demonstrated that at least one genotype of Trypanosoma copemani has an intracellular amastigote stage and that infections are associated with tissue changes in smooth and cardiac muscle, very similar to those characteristic of Chagas disease in humans (Botero et al., 2013). As with Leishmania, these findings raise the possibility of Australian native fauna acting as reservoirs for T. cruzi introduced in Chagas patients from South America, and which can be transmitted in the same vectors of wildife trypanosomes such as T. copemani.",

However, this may not always be the case, especially if host susceptibility is compromised as with two recent reports of Babesia microti in human patients in Australia (Fuller et al., 2012, Senanayake et al., 2012). The first was believed to be locally acquired, whereas the history of the latter case suggested it was imported. These are the first reports of B. microti in humans in Australia and may not necessarily be imported since too few studies have been undertaken of Australian native wildlife to rule out the occurrence of B. microti, especially considering the genetic diversity of the B. microti sp. complex. For example, the recent description of a new species of Babesia in kangaroos (Dawood et al., 2013) may only be the \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019 in describing new species as more molecular-based surveillance of wildlife parasites is undertaken.",

This requires increased surveillance of wildlife populations and an ecological approach to studying host, wild and domestic, and environmental ecosystems. It is not just a matter of cataloguing which parasites infect wildlife. Acquired data must be interpreted in a true One Health philosophy in which parasite biodiversity in wildlife hosts is considered in terms of its impact on non-wildlife hosts and vice versa, but also the potential impact of parasite biodiversity perturbations, or loss, on wildlife health.",

The cestocide used is praziquantel, which will have no effect on the nematode or protozoal intestinal fauna of foxes. Such control programmes will therefore alter the parasite community of a wild host. Is this something that should be considered without knowing the effects of treatment on other fox parasites? A recent study of the effects of anthelmintic treatment in wild mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) resulted in an unexpected increase of non-targeted parasites, coccidia and cestodes (Pedersen and Antonovics, 2013). Although further studies are required to determine the long-term consequences of this alteration to the parasite community, if any, in wild mice, coccidia have been associated with decreased mass and lower over-wintering survival in P. maniculatus (Vandegrift et al., 2008, Pedersen and Antonovics, 2013). Thus foxes receiving cestocidal treatment with praziquantel may experience alterations to their intestinal parasite fauna with unknown consequences. It is unlikely to be of public health significance but could adversely impact the health of foxes if the removal of cestodes causes an increase in non-targeted parasites, nematodes and protozoa. This could, in turn, alter the ecological balance between foxes, rodent intermediate hosts and raccoon dogs with the latter emerging in prominence as a definitive host for E. multilocularis. Unlikely, I concede, but this serves to demonstrate the ecological considerations that should form part of our approach to parasite zoonoses and wildlife.",
