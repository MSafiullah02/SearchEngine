This disease is caused by infection with a novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 1, 2, 3, which affected more than 8000 individuals across 32 countries and resulted in more than 800 fatalities in 2003 4, 5, 6. The origin of SARS-CoV is unclear, though studies on the molecular evolution of SARS-CoV indicate that the virus may have emerged from nonhuman species [7]. At present, no efficacious therapy for SARS is available. Therefore, a search for effective antivirals for the SARS-CoV is of current interest.",

This approach relies on the use of high-yield organic reactions that can be carried out in water or water-miscible, nontoxic solvents on microscales without protecting groups, allowing the product to be assayed directly in situ without isolation and purification.

In order to find more potent 3CLpro inhibitors, a library of Lopinavir-like compounds was assembled by using either diamine 1 or amine 2 as the core structure [24] for reaction with various acids in microtiter plates followed by screening in situ (Figure 1). In a typical procedure 21, 22, 23, a library of 90 carboxylic acids (see the Supplemental Data available with this article online) (10 \u03bcmol each) in a microtiter plate was used to couple with amine 1 or 2 (10 \u03bcmol) in the presence of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (22 \u03bcmol) and 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU, 11 \u03bcmol) in DMF (100 \u03bcl) for 4 hr. An aliquot of the product, based on a putative 100% conversion of starting materials, was taken and subjected to the 3CLpro inhibition assay in a 20 mM Bis-Tris buffer (pH 7.0) at 25\u00b0C. To obtain the IC50 values, the initial velocities of the inhibited reactions with 50 nM of the protease and 6 \u03bcM of a fluorogenic substrate were plotted against different inhibitor concentrations. In this study, we noticed that the products derived from 2-aminobenzoic acid (well C9, IC50 = 0.2 \u03bcM), 4-(methylamino)benzoic acid (well D5, IC50 = 0.3 \u03bcM), 4-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (well D6, IC50 = 0.5 \u03bcM), and 4-(diethylamino)benzoic acid (well D7, IC50 = 0.5 \u03bcM) showed the best inhibition and that the degree of inhibition was independent of the amine used.",

            "text": "In order to characterize the inhibitors, we attempted to separately prepare the pure amide derivatives, but we found that the amide formation was very slow, and that the intermediates benzotriazole esters 3\u22126 were isolated as major products from silica gel columns (the X-ray ORTEP structure of compound 4 is shown in the Supplemental Data). To our surprise, all of the Lopinavir-like compounds showed only modest inhibitory activities toward 3CLpro (IC50 \u2265 10 \u03bcM), whereas benzotriazole esters 3\u22126 showed high inhibition activities. To our knowledge, benzotriazole esters have been used as acylating agents and have never been found to be enzyme inhibitors. We then prepared a series of benzotriazole esters by condensation of HBTU with various carboxylic acids (Figure 1B), and we found that the benzotriazole esters derived from benzoic acid containing electron-withdrawing substituents, e.g., NO2, CN, and CF3, were susceptible to hydrolysis, whereas benzotriazole esters 3\u20136 and those with electron-donating groups were relatively stable in pH 5.0\u20138.0 over 24 hr at room temperature. The relative stability of each derivative depends on the pKa of the corresponding benzoic acid and basically follows the Hammett equation 25, 26, 27. These stable benzotriazole esters, esters 3\u201310 (Figure 1C), were assayed, and their inhibition results against 3CLpro are shown in\nTable 1.",

            "text": "Further study of the inhibition of benzotriazole esters 3\u201310 showed that there was a time-dependent decrease in enzyme activity as a function of the inhibitor concentration (e.g., the inhibition of compound 4) (\nFigure 2A). In the presence of 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), the preincubation of enzyme with inhibitor did not affect the enzyme activity, indicating that DTT can protect the enzyme from inactivation (Figure 2B). These experiments indicate an irreversible mode of action and point to the active site Cys being involved in the inactivation process. The kinetic results for k\ninact and K\ni determinations of compound 4 are shown in Figures 2C and 2D (the detailed procedures are shown in the Supplemental Data). We used the initial rate of inactivation (0\u201310 min) showing pseudo first-order kinetics to determine the inhibition constants. The enzyme activity is, however, not reduced to zero over the time period, perhaps because of the decomposition of the thioester intermediate or the existence of two populations of the enzymes. As shown in Table 1, benzotriazole esters 3\u201310 are strong inhibitors, and, among these, 8 is the most potent, with an inactivation constant of 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 s\u22121 and an inhibition constant of 7.5 nM. In addition, these esters are not toxic to Vero E6 cells, which are often used in the cell-based assay for SARS-CoV [14], at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM. Compound 8 represents the most potent mechanism-based 3CLpro inhibitor reported to date.",

Electrospray ionization mass spectra of wild-type 3CLpro and 3CLpro treated with 4-(dimethylamino)benzoyl ester 4 (2 hr of incubation and 18 hr of dialysis) and their deconvoluted mass spectra were determined (see the Supplemental Data). The mass difference of 148.6 Da between the peaks of 33847.35 ([M + H]+) and 33995.93 ([M + H]+) implies the acylation of 3CLpro with a 4-(dimethylamino)benzoyl moiety (mass 147.12). To further investigate the acylation site, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of the trypsin digest of 3CLpro and 3CLpro treated with 4-(dimethylamino)benzoyl ester 4 was performed. From the MALDI spectra of the tryptic 3CLpro and the tryptic acylated 3CLpro of G138-K180 peptide fragments, a mass shift of 147 Da between T15 (4594.11 Da) and acylated T15 (4741.31 Da) indicates that this peptide fragment contains an acylated residue (\nFigures 3A and 3B). In order to determine the acylation site on the acylated T15 peptide, we performed a sequence analysis by MALDI MS/MS for peptides T15 and acylated T15 as depicted in Figure 3C. There is no mass difference among y series fragment ions up to y27, but a mass shift of 147.2 Da (4149.6 Da versus 4296.8 Da) on b39 clearly shows that Cys145 is the only acylation site. This is consistent with the observation of no mass shift of mutant C145A 3CLpro treated with 4-(dimethylamino)benzoyl ester 4. All of these results support the mechanism of irreversible inhibition of 3CLpro by 4-(dimethylamino)benzoyl ester 4 via acylation of Cys145 (\nFigure 4).",

The \u03b3-S atom of Cys145 was close enough, within 3.5 \u00c5 in a rigid model, to the carbonyl group of the benzotriazole ester to render a nucleophilic attack.

The NH group of the indole moiety of 8 was hydrogen bonded with the side chain OH of Thr25. In comparison, the indole group of 9 lacks such hydrogen bonding and thus shows a weaker affinity toward 3CLpro than does isomer 8.
