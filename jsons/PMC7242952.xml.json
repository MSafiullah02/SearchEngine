In Italy the most current analysis shows that of 69.1% of the deceased patients were hypertensives and 30% used angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and 17% angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).6 Despite the above observations, there are no robust data to suggest clearly an independent link of hypertension with increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.7 Similarly, in other lower respiratory track infections, diabetes and heart failure are independently related to adverse outcome, while hypertension per se is not.7\n",

There are data from animal studies for a more consistent upregulation of ACE-2 with the majority of ARBs, while the effect of ACEIs was variable.7 This knowledge led to the opinion of potential susceptibility of patients on ACEIs and ARBs to COVID-19 infection13 but this is currently unjustified. Firstly, the data in humans are scarce and only in the small intestine enterocytes upregulation of ACE-2 is reported due to ACEI.14 Regarding the lungs there are zero evidence for humans and even if existed cannot directly lead to the conclusion that this upregulation can indeed facilitate viral cell entry.7 If one wants to focus on pneumonia outside the COVID-19 setting, the use of ACEIs and ARBs reduces the risk of infection15 and related mortality.7\n",

            "text": "In the era of COVID-19 \u201csocial distancing\u201d, the \u201cscientific approaching\u201d by rapid and free exchange of knowledge provides the scaffold for better therapeutic answers. We should be therefore thankful to the researchers for the important emerging data.16, 17, 18, 19 Firstly, Zhang P et al conducted a retrospective, multi-center study including 1128 adult patients with hypertension diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to hospitals in the Hubei Province.16 They showed that the incidence of the 28-day all-cause death among hypertensives who had inpatient treatment with ACEIs/ARBs is significant lower compared with ACEI/ARB non-users (3.7% vs. 9.8%; p = 0.01).16 Even after matching and adjusting variables in-hospital use of ACEIs/ARBs still exhibits remarkable association with reduced all-cause mortality. And even more recently, three simultaneous publications shed further light into the debate of renin-angiotensin therapies in the COVID-19 setting. 17, 18, 19 The work by Reynolds H et al showed that among 12594 patients who were tested for COVID-19 there was no association of ACEIs/ARBs with increased likelihood of a positive test or severe infection.17 Further insight is provided by Mancia G et al focusing in 6272 cases with severe COVID-19.18 After adjustment for confounders there was no independent association for the use of ACEIs/ARBs with susceptibility for infection or worse clinical outcome in contrast to loop diuretics that were linked to enhanced risk.18 Interestingly the publication by Mehra M et al, included international data from 169 hospitals (11 countries in Asia, Europe, and North America) for 8910 patients with COVID-19 for whom discharge status was available.19 There was no harmful association of either ACEIs or ARBs with mortality but also it was demonstrated that the use of statins and ACEIs was linked to less in-hospital deaths.19 These findings clearly support recently published recommendations by many societies regarding continuation of ACEIs or ARBs among patients with co-existing hypertension, cardiovascular disease and COVID-19.20\n,\n21 Moreover, they provide further rationale for ongoing studies with drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin system for therapy of COVID-19, like losartan for hospitalized (\u039dCT04312009) and non-hospitalized patients (NCT043111177).22\n",

This \u201cthird wave\u201d in the upcoming months and years is related to major events that would lead to a massive burden to the health systems because of COVID-19 related postponed guideline care in major disease states among them the cardiovascular ones. For hypertensive patients this is highly relevant due to the lack of regular follow-up along with destabilization of blood pressure levels due to unjustified discontinuation or modification of dosage of ACEIs/ARBs that can lead to heightened cardiovascular risk.23 This outside-the- norm approach to chronic diseases might be a reaction of the public, as well as of some health providers, to the media-induced frenzy for the novel coronavirus. Attention should be paid to the latter phenomenon and the cardiovascular community has already played a key role on establishing guidance for treatment and continuity of care for high risk patients.7\n,\n20 Interplay with the organization of the health systems and governments is needed to sufficiently address the \u201cburden\u201d of cardiovascular emergencies and routine cases throughout the COVID-19 era.",
