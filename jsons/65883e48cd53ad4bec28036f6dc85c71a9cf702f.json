Much of the infectious disease burden is caused by diseases that have a long history in human populations, such as measles, influenza, and pertussis. In recent years, additional disease burden has emerged from outbreaks of HIV, Chikungunya, Zika virus, Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome, coronavirus, Nipah virus, and Lassa fever, underscoring the continued vulnerability of human populations to novel and re-emerging threats. Mathematical models of infectious disease can be used to understand and predict epidemiological trajectories of outbreaks; they can then be applied to optimize strategies for mitigating disease transmission. These models incorporate pertinent environmental factors, such as seasonal fluctuations, that affect survival or activity of pathogens and their vectors. They can also address complexities of host behavioral change, including local and global human societal changes, health policy, clinical trial design, and resource allocation, which have been increasingly guided by modeling studies.",

Some authorities may enact recommendations and policies that increase social distancing, by which gatherings of individuals in affected areas are reduced through school or workplace closures. One approach to capturing how social distancing approaches reduce transmission is to model the social network explicitly, as opposed to assuming homogeneous mixing within the population. For instance, school networks could be superimposed on a dynamic model, keeping track of schoolage individuals in the population and calculating their risks of infection as a function of transmission in both schools and the wider community. Even in the absence of enforced policies, individuals often spontaneously reduce their contacts in response to an outbreak by keeping children home from school, washing their hands more frequently, or avoiding public transit [8] . Such behavior change can be represented in a network model by incorporating a contact rate between network neighbors that depends on local rather than overall disease prevalence in the network [6] .",

In the case of potentially airborne-transmitted and highly infectious measles, vaccination is one of the most effective interventions; therefore, population concern about vaccine safety must be addressed. In contrast, no vaccine was available in the initial phase of the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic; because Ebola virus can easily be transmitted through close contact with the deceased, population attitudes toward funerary customs had to be addressed. Such examples also illustrate the mutual feedback that operates between host behavior and disease dynamics, wherein human behavior impacts transmission (e.g., reduced infection prevalence due to greater uptake of vaccines or participation in public health recommendations), but epidemiological trajectories can also influence behavior as perceptions of infection risk evolve. Such coupled behavior-disease systems can be represented by embedding dynamic transmission models within game theoretic or other behavioral frameworks. The resulting models can be informed by data regarding contact patterns and decision-making, as well as how the incubation period and the mode of transmission interact with host risk perception.",

Modeling analyses determined false-positive rates and power across ranges of Ebola vaccine efficacy and trial start dates, comparing the stepped wedge and randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs [13] .

Endgame strategies to achieve and maintain elimination of disease in areas with low incidence can be evaluated using mathematical modeling. It is important to identify characteristics of remaining cases and incorporate them into the model through stratification of compartments or of individuals, in the case of an agent-based model, by risk of infection. Similarly, any individuals who are responsible for the bulk of transmission, such as due to genetic predisposition to high microbial loads, should be included within the model structure as superspreaders (Box 14.2).

By combining cost-effectiveness analysis with a dynamic transmission model, the positive externality that vaccination has in terms of reducing transmission within the population can be incorporated. Such models have spurred change, such as in the case of the decision by the UK National Health Services to offer rotavirus vaccination for infants nationally [43] , a policy previously deemed to be insufficiently cost-effective for the UK.

Historically, model parameters have been calibrated to available data in an ad hoc manner [17] . Uncertainty analysis can be performed by Bayesian and semi-Bayesian approaches that evaluate a probable distribution of candidate parameter values from a prior distribution and/or their (continued) Box 14.1 (continued) likelihood of producing model output that matches empirical data. Bayesian fitting methods [22] include Bayesian melding, Markov chain Monte Carlo integration, approximate Bayesian computation, particle filtering, and application of weighted Bayesian information criteria; Bayesian methods frequently supply a natural means to blend the empirical data being used for fitting (e.g., prevalence or incidence data) with other data from the literature (e.g., duration of infection, incubation period, and measures of relative infectiousness such as viral load). The posterior distributions of probable estimates that result from such methods characterize ranges of output that are appropriately influenced by but not entirely dictated by small sets of field data. Extension of Bayesian analyses to implement probabilistic sensitivity analysis is also straightforward and provides rigorous evaluation of model assumptions by considering the change in model output when drawing from ranges of empirically supported inputs [11] . These procedures of uncertainty analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis allow modelers to better guide public health decision-makers on the full range of potential transmission and intervention effectiveness outcomes. The selected infectious disease model structure varies with the system being modeled and the research question, as outlined previously [9, 10] . A basic model design can be extended to include heterogeneity in biological susceptibility or exposure to infection. Exposure that varies due to behavioral dynamics can be accounted for as a fixed measure whereby a proportion of the affected population is involved in intervention with some level of adherence or as a dynamic measure that changes with time in response to increased awareness of disease. These extensions enhance the ability of the model to accurately estimate the effectiveness of interventions and thus estimate the costs of implementing strategies relative to changes in outcome measures",

Nonetheless, heterogeneity within host populations can be incorporated by stratifying compartments according to, for example, age and risk factors that affect likelihoods of disease states. When a pathogen is composed of multiple antigenic strains that each elicit distinct immunological responses-such as is the case for pneumococci or human papilloma viruses-it could be important to stratify the immune state of the host according to strain-specific immunity. Stratifying by strain-specific immunity, for example, would permit accurate evaluation of the effectiveness of a vaccine that only covers a subset of the circulating strains. However, stratification should be used sparingly in deterministic compartment models, to reflect salient features of the epidemiological dynamics: as stratifications expand, the number of equations needed to describe transitions between compartments can exceed the number of host individuals in the population. If multifactorial stratification is necessary, it can become more efficient to adopt an agent-based framework (Box 14.2) in which the progression of each individual host is tracked through model states. In an agent-based model, each rate of disease transmission and progression is attributed specifically for every individual. However, agent-based models can only perform better to the extent that they can capture real information about contact mixing in the population. Availability of sufficient data with which to parameterize such individual-level specificities is a principal challenge in the development of agent-based models (Box 14.2).",

Scaling 2 Models are constructed with close accordance to the hypotheses that the models will be used to investigate. The structure of most disease transmission models is based on compartmentalizing individuals into categories of susceptible (S), infected (I), and-depending on the disease mechanism-recovered (R) with immunity. Additional model complexity could involve including a latency compartment (E) during which individuals are not infectious. Each arrow between compartments represents a directional rate of transition (or parameter) which is ideally informed by empirical data. Simple compartmental models are limited in their ability to capture complex disease systems; model extensions such as risk stratification and other model structures with finer units of transmission may be considered depending on the availability of sufficient data for parameterization up from representing a single population to a group of populations, metapopulation models (Box 14.2) can be used to incorporate spatial heterogeneity in disease risk factors.

Because the outcome of simulating deterministic models is always the same for a given set of parameters and initial conditions (e.g., population size and relative numbers of susceptible and infected individuals), incorporation of stochasticity into models enables probabilistic predictions that can quantify unlikely but highly important outcomes (e.g., persistence of disease despite a high chance of elimination by temporarily imposed measures).

For example, the R 0 values for influenza and for HIV have both been estimated at around 2 for specific settings [9] , yet the epidemiological trajectories of these two diseases are dramatically different because the time period over which each infected host exposes two other hosts differs dramatically between the pathogens. Individuals with influenza remain infectious for about a week, while those with HIV can remain infectious for several months to years in the absence of treatment. Thus, to project epidemic curves and to estimate the timescales of outbreaks, the generation time (Box 14.2) of an infection is essential. Generation time, in turn, is determined by the within-host progression of infection as well as mode of transmission. R 0 can be elaborated on by quantifying the effective reproductive number, R e , which is the average number of secondary infections caused by a single primary infection in a host population with some pre-existing immunity caused by vaccination or previous infection. Because pre-existing immunity is typically present to some degree, interventions that suppress R e below 1 are predicted to control and ultimately eliminate the disease. This deterministic threshold is one basis for policy decisions regarding the level of interventions that should be implemented to eradicate a microbial disease. However, an intervention that brings R e to a level just below 1 is only about 50% likely to actually do so [11] as its calculation is dependent on the accuracy of all parameters estimated.",

Such models are driven by a set of basic functions and parameters, including the rate of transmission, latency duration, infectious period, and waning of immunity. Values to inform parameters are derived from available surveillance data and published findings of observational studies, laboratory studies, and clinical trials, sometimes by using assumptions regarding applicability. For example, a natural history study on pneumococcal infections in children [19, 20] could be used to parameterize the attack rates for specific strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae across other age groups. Even small datasets that on their own do little to constrain a parameter can be informative using likelihood fitting procedures. See Box 14.2 that can draw upon that information in combination with other parameter constraints and primary epidemiological data such as prevalence and incidence rates. In Bayesian, or semi-Bayesian approaches, prior information based on small datasets can be usefully incorporated as a weak prior probability distribution for the parameter. Information from previous studies and the fit to current empirical data are increasingly being evaluated simultaneously with Bayesian or semi-Bayesian methods (see Box 14.1; [21, 22] ). Incorporation of prior data that is informative about model parameters aids in the fitting of complex models with many parameters. Recent computational advances have rendered more complex models increasingly tractable; however, a healthy skepticism with regard to whether data is reliably informative must be applied to ensure predictions are well-founded. Moreover, with complexity come additional challenges adequately exploring parameter space in the performance of model fitting. A complex model without sufficient data for parameterization can yield wildly inaccurate predictions-even when it has been constructed with a highly realistic, detailed structure and an excellent perceived fit to primary epidemiological data. Therefore, structural complexity and the number of model parameters should be kept to an informative minimum [23, 24] .",

Sensitivity analysis can be performed by varying the values of parameters above and below the best point estimates and reevaluating the model output. For instance, a cost-effectiveness study of rotavirus vaccination in Canada included a sensitivity analysis to evaluate how the net benefit of vaccination was affected by changes in population-level risk of rotavirus gastroenteritis [25] . Significant seasonal variation has been observed in rotavirus disease risk, and, even when accounting for variation in season of birth, rotavirus immunization remained a highly cost-effective strategy for British Columbia, Canada [25] . When results vary significantly with perturbation to an empirically uncertain parameter (i.e., a parameter whose value has only been established by minimal field or experimental data), a distribution of probable values-rather than just a single-point estimate-can be supplied to the model to generate a credible range of model outputs. In other words, point estimates alone do not quantify the extent of uncertainty in the estimate, and arbitrarily selected degrees of perturbation can poorly represent the effects of erroneous parameter values. There can, for instance, be substantial asymmetries in the uncertainty above and below-point parameter estimates. Quantifying the extent and asymmetry of uncertainty is important for determining the robustness of estimated effectiveness of control interventions that are fundamental to policy decision-making. For example, a study investigating pre-and posttreatment efficacy of mebendazole against soil-transmitted helminth infection in Tanzania reported the mean egg reduction rate (ERR) observed with the 95% confidence interval and sample size [26] . For these data, a point estimate approach would use the mean ERR as a measure of treatment efficacy, whereas an uncertainty analysis would involve iteratively simulating the model and randomly drawing an efficacy estimate from the full distribution of empirically observed ERRs. In the latter case, the predicted impact of a treatment campaign, such as changes in population-level infection intensity, would be represented as a range of all results calculated across the distribution of efficacy. When the effects of changes to the value of a parameter on outcomes are nonlinear within the range of uncertainty-as they often are in infectious disease models-the probabilistically weighted average outcome can be surprisingly different from the outcome calculated from the best point estimates. It should further be noted that, in addition to uncertainty in parameter values due to imperfect data, some parameters have inherent variability. Susceptibility to infection or treatment efficacy may vary due to factors such as genetic constitution or acquired immunodeficiency, such that drawing from a distribution of observed efficacy values in a compartmental model will reflect inherent heterogeneity in the parameter and thus in the system being modeled.",

In fact, the model-guided fieldwork paradigm [27] suggests that mathematical models can be incorporated into all phases of field research to improve our understanding of infectious disease ecology and complex biological systems. The iterative testing of hypotheses through empirical research and mathematical modeling while concurrently informing study design and model evaluation is a powerful approach for the study and control of disease (Fig. 14.3) . The need for sequential data-gathering efforts and analysis and the consequent increased collaboration among experimentalists, policy-makers, and modelers are surmountable barriers to the integration of modeling evidence and public health policy. This iterative feedback approach has been increasingly advocated by researchers [12, 18] and has been demonstrated with applications in the evaluation of the rapid diagnostic test Xpert for tuberculosis [28] . An early modeling Rather than extracting single-point estimates, modelers can make full use of data by (B) constructing data-driven distributions of possible values for parameters and then sampling values from those distributions during iterative model runs. Iterations of the model are executed drawing probabilistically from distributions of data to generate (C) probabilistic distributions of predictions. Examples of the types of predictions that can be generated include estimates of disease burden and cost of intervention to inform policy decisions. Policy questions, such as whether to recommend a new vaccine, determine (D) specific variables to evaluate (e.g., cost-effectiveness). In a probabilistic framework, decision-makers are conveyed not only appropriate estimates of outcomes but also a sense of how much confidence they can have in those estimates. Settings for (E) variables that are under the presumed control of policy-makers can be pre-defined and can be further informed by initial model findings that lead to updated iterations of the model. Such policy variables could include cost, dosage schedule, and age of administration study suggested that significant reductions in TB morbidity and mortality would be associated with increases in rates of TB diagnosis due to Xpert use and the assumed corresponding increases in treatment seeking. However, clinical trials in TB-endemic areas demonstrated lower-than-expected impact of the new diagnostic since treatment coverage in such areas was already very high [29] . The new data on TB treatment practices resulted in iterative improvements in the model so that it could more accurately evaluate new diagnostic technologies across different endemic settings [28] .",

Despite computational challenges of updating model structure to assess all strategies for a given disease system, a modeling approach for the evaluation of options is often significantly more feasible than conducting diverse field trials. To inform health policy decisions, the criteria of optimization can incorporate economic and logistical considerations, as well as mortality and morbidity outcomes. For example, a model evaluating the optimal vaccine distribution to avert influenza outbreaks in the USA determined that the distribution of 63 million vaccine doses could reduce R e and extinguish an outbreak that had similar transmissibility and mortality patterns as historical influenza pandemics [32] . Analyses of the age-structured model optimized vaccine allocation across a range of available doses and demonstrated that vaccination of school-aged children 5-19 years would be most effective by every outcome measure considered, infections, hospitalizations, mortality, years of life lost, and economic impact, a finding that was robust to parameter uncertainty [33] . This finding challenged the efficiency of the then-current strategy behind the estimated 85 million annual vaccine doses that were being administered for seasonal influenza. The results of this modeling study spurred a shift in influenza vaccination policy in the USA [34] to focus on children and teenagers, who are responsible for the most transmission, in addition to older adults, who are at greatest risk of influenza-associated morbidity and mortality.",

The structure of most disease transmission models is based on compartmentalizing individuals into categories of susceptible (S), infected (I), and-depending on the disease mechanism-recovered (R) with immunity. Additional model complexity could involve including a latency compartment (E) during which individuals are not infectious. Each arrow between compartments represents a directional rate of transition (or parameter) which is ideally informed by empirical data. Simple compartmental models are limited in their ability to capture complex disease systems; model extensions such as risk stratification and other model structures with finer units of transmission may be considered depending on the availability of sufficient data for parameterization",
