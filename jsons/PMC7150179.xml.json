            "text": "Vaccines are considered among the most valuable and cost-effective tools for the control of infectious diseases; indeed, universal immunization of infants and children against a variety of pathogens was considered one of the top ten achievements of the 20th century (CDC, 1999). Major scientific, technical, ethical, and regulatory principles and/or processes underpinning the vaccine development and evaluation process have been defined; however, challenges posed by the threats of bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases, as well as technological advances in the composition, formulation, and delivery of vaccines, expose gaps in policy and practice that require ongoing consideration and refinement of approaches to the evaluation of new vaccines. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a brief overview of the approach to the evaluation of candidate vaccines in humans, with a particular attention to issues related to vaccines for biodefense and emerging and neglected diseases. The major focus will be on clinical trials and protocol development in the US, although many of the principles, regulations, and practices have been harmonized across the globe. A brief overview of related regulatory issues and preclinical vaccine development is provided; however, detailed discussions of these topics can be found elsewhere in this volume.",

            "text": "In 1901, a number of children became ill and died after treatment with diphtheria antitoxin contaminated with tetanus toxin. This episode resulted in the first legislation designed to regulate the purity and potency of biologicals\u2014the Biologics Control Act (BCA) of 1902. In 1938, over 100 people died after ingesting an elixir of sulfanilamide containing diethy\u00adlene glycol (antifreeze), leading to the enactment of the FDCA (Ballentine, 1981). Provisions of the FDCA required manufacturers to submit safety data to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prior to registration. The 1962 Kefauver\u2013Harris Amendments to the FDCA required that efficacy data also be submitted. The1944 Public Health Service Act incorporated the BCA into section 351 of the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which gave the federal government the authority to license biologicals and manufacturing facilities. In 1955, incomplete inactivation of a poliovirus vaccine resulted in the development of polio in a number of children (the \u201cCutter Incident\u201d); this led to the establishment of the Division of Biologics Standards (DBS) within the NIH (Offit, 2005). The authority vested in the DBS was transferred to the FDA in 1972. The organization that is currently responsible for regulating biologics is the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the FDA. Title 21 of the CFR contains regulations pertaining to biologicals, including product standards, manufacturing, labeling, licensing, advertising, investigational use, and protection of human subjects (informed consent, nonclinical laboratory studies, and Institutional Review Boards, or IRBs). Part 312 of Title 21 CFR contains regulations related to the Investigational New Drug Application (IND). The CFR is updated each year to reflect changes in policies and procedures. Additional guidance documents related to vaccines are published by the FDA, as appropriate.",

The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Regis\u00adtration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) established guidelines for the conduct of clinical research (Good Clinical Practice, or GCP), many of which have been adopted by the US FDA (FDA, 1996). The ICH GCP provides a unified standard to ensure the quality of clinical trial data and the protection of human subjects for the European Union, Japan, and the US for clinical trials that will support licensure of new vaccines and drugs. For research related to the evaluation of vaccines for emerging and neglected diseases, implementation of GCP in developing countries may pose unique challenges. Acosta et al.

This article and the subsequent expose of the ethical violations perpetrated during the Tuskeege Syphilis Study led to the 1974 National Research Act, which established IRBs and the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. After considering the principles and practices of human research in the US, the commission published the Belmont Report in 1979. This report defined the three major ethical principles (and their related clinical trial applications) pertaining to human research: respect for persons (informed consent); beneficence (risk-benefit assessment); and justice (equitable subject selection). Recommendations of the National Bioethics Commission from 1981 related to research involving human subjects were adopted into federal law in 1991. The so-called Common Rule (45 CFR 46 Subpart A) articulated the federal policy for protection of human subjects who are participating in clinical trials. Additional protections for pregnant women and fetuses, prisoners, and children are outlined in Subparts B, C, and D of 45 CFR 46. The Council for International Organizations and Medical Sciences, formed in 1949, recently published updated international ethical guidelines for research involving human subjects (CIOMS, 2002).",

Seven ethical requirements that should be fulfilled in the conduct of clinical research have been proposed by Emanuel et al. (2000): the research should provide information that will advance science and knowledge (value); scientific validity; fair subject selection; favorable risk-benefit ratio; independent review; informed consent; and respect for enrolled subjects. The increasing complexity and redundancy of the oversight of contemporary clinical trials reflects the commitment to accomplish these goals. A simplified prototypical organizational structure for a vaccine research clinical trial is shown in Fig. 12.1\n.

Typicallyless than 100 healthy young adult subjects are enrolled in phase 1 trials. In fact, the number may be considerably smaller for novel products, in which case investigators may elect to inoculate only a handful of subjects to exclude the possibility of unexpected reactogenicity or toxicity (Keitel et al., 1993a). The major goal of the phase 1 trial is to assess safety and tolerability; however, preliminary immunogenicity assessments and dose-ranging information can provide valuable information regarding dosage selection for subsequent evaluations. Although the design of phase 1 clinical trials of drugs often is open-label, many contemporary phase 1 clinical trials of candidate vaccines are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. The phase 1 trial may be performed in stages, where a small cohort of subjects is vaccinated and observed for a period of 1\u20134 or more weeks before the remainder of the study cohort is vaccinated in stage 2. This approach reduces the exposure of subjects to the occurrence of unexpected toxicity. For vaccines that are produced in the US whose ultimate use will be in other countries (such as malaria vaccines), the initial evaluation occurs in the US (phase 1a), followed by phase 1b testing in a healthy population in the target country. Inclusion of placebos in this and other phases of development reduces bias in the assessment of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs), and provides internal controls for laboratory assessments of immune responses following immunization.",

In some circumstances, specific monitoring of subjects in phase 1 or phase 2 trials for evidence of infection after immunization is relevant, particularly if there are concerns that the vaccine might elicit immunopathologic responses when the vaccinated subject is naturally infected. Immunopatholgy resulting in severe atypical infection and/or death occurred among persons immunized with an inactivated measles vaccine and in infants given an inactivated vaccine to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine (Polack, 2007). Similar concerns exist regarding the potential for dengue virus and SARS coronavirus vaccines to elicit immunopathologic responses (Edelman et al., 2003; Deming et al., 2006).",

Several hundred healthy subjects may be enrolled into phase 2 trials. The major goals of phase 2 trials are to assess safety and to develop optimal regimens for immunization. Typically several dosage levels are evaluated; different immunization regimens (number of doses and interval between doses) also may be explored. Most phase 2 trials are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Although larger numbers of subjects are evaluated, phase 2 trials still lack statistical power to detect events that occur in a low proportion of subjects. Initial phase 2 trials are usually conducted among persons who are at low risk for acquiring the target disease; therefore, additional phase 1 and phase 2 trials may be necessary to assess safety and immunogenicity among populations who are at high risk for the disease, in which pivotal efficacy trials will be conducted. For several emerging and neglected diseases, the preliminary efficacy of a vaccine can be assessed in a human challenge model, including malaria, influenza, and cholera (Couch et al., 1971; Epstein et al., 2007; Tacket et al., 1999). These carefully controlled experimental inoculations of subjects with the target pathogen can provide proof of concept that immunization with a vaccine candidate confers protection prior to large phase 3 clinical trials. In the pediatric population, rechallenge of vaccinated subjects with homologous or related live attenuated influenza virus vaccines (LAIV) provided supportive evidence that intranasal immunization with LAIV would confer protection against subsequent infection with wild-type influenza viruses (Belshe et al., 2000). Phase 2 trials may also incorporate plans to assess the concomitant administration of other vaccines, biologicals, or medications. For example, administration of a new vaccine to infants in the context of the increasingly complicated childhood immunization schedule poses complex problems; evidence that simultaneous administration of licensed and experimental vaccines does not interfere with protective responses to components in either product is necessary (Rennels et al., 2000).",

For example, smallpox, inhalational anthrax, hemorrhagic fever viruses, tularemia, plague, and influenza A/H5N1 do not occur naturally at a frequency high enough to permit controlled evaluation of clinical vaccine efficacy prior to licensure of vaccines. The FDA final rule entitled \u201cNew Drug and Biological Drug Products: Evidence Needed to Demonstrate Effectiveness of New Drugs When Human Efficacy Studies Are Not Ethical or Feasible\u201d (otherwise referred to as the \u201cAnimal Rule\u201d) was published to address this circumstance (FDA, 2002). The rule permits use of animal efficacy data when collection of human efficacy data is not feasible. Safety and immunogenicity data in humans and animal efficacy data can be used to support licensure when several conditions are met, as follows: (1) the pathophysiology of the infection is reasonably well understood; (2) the pathogenesis and immune responses in one or two animal species are expected to predict these responses in humans; (3) the immunogenicity endpoint(s) correlated with protection in the animal(s) are related to human immune responses; and (4) immunogenicity endpoints in animals and humans are sufficiently well understood to permit selection of a regimen that would be expected to predict protection in humans. For other diseases where correlates of protection are reasonably well defined (for example, serum HAI antibody level against influenza viruses), surrogate markers can be used to support licensure (FDA, 2007a). Finally, in order to facilitate the approval of vaccines for such severe, life-threatening illnesses, additional mechanisms for expedited review and accelerated approval have been developed by the FDA.",

The long-term safety or continued efficacy of a vaccine may be unknown at the time of licensure, and the benefit of immunization of special populations that may have been underrepresented or not studied in the IND stage may be of interest. Unfortunately, phase 4 clinical trials typically are not randomized, and they may be uncontrolled. Nevertheless, several safety surveillance systems have been established to facilitate the early detection of potential rare, serious reactions to vaccines, including the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), and the American Academy of Pediatrics Practice Research Office Settings (PROS) (Ellenberg et al., 2005).

For clinical trials of candidate vaccines, the study design typically is a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial\u2014one example of a parallel group design. Phase 1 safety and tolerability studies often utilize a titration design, where ascending dosages of the experimental agent are sequentially administered to new cohorts of subjects (Gorse et al., 2006). Cluster-randomized clinical trial design is occasionally employed to assess vaccine efficacy. In this circumstance, larger groups of individuals (such as nursing homes or schools) are randomized to an intervention, rather than individual subjects, and the clinical endpoints are ascertained for vaccinated subjects (Rodrigues et al., 2005), or for a subset of the cluster, such as the contacts of healthcare workers in a closed setting (Hayward et al., 2006). Phase 1 clinical trials historically were open-label; however, in recent years most phase 1 clinical trials of vaccines have been randomized and blinded. The value of a placebo control in clinical trials has been described; however, a licensed control vaccine may be used rather than a placebo, particularly for phase 3 clinical trials in children. In a recent phase 3 clinical trial of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in infants, a meningococcal type C vaccine served as the control vaccine (Black et al., 2000). In this case, the meningococcal control vaccine provided potential benefits to the study participants. Flexible adaptive design methods frequently are employed in the development of vaccines; these incorporate plans for modifications of the clinical trial design that are made before or during the conduct of the research (Chow and Chang, 2007). Adaptations to ongoing trials may include prospective adaptations, such as interim analysis, stopping rules for early termination due to futility/safety concerns/efficacy, or sample size re-estimation; ad hoc adaptations such as changes in inclusion and exclusion criteria, dosage or regimen alteration, and trial duration; or retrospective adaptations at the end of the study but before unblinding, including changing the study endpoint or altering the statistical hypothesis (superiority to noninferiority). The goal of this approach is to permit modification based on accumulated evidence to alter trial design to increase the probability of success without undermining the validity of the trial (Gallo et al., 2006). Such adaptations may require modifications of the study hypotheses, protocol amendments, and sample size recalculations.",

Information regarding serosusceptibility to the candidate pathogen may be necessary. For example, a phase 1 clinical trial of a dengue virus vaccine may require evidence of no prior infections caused by these viruses (Edelman et al., 2003), and a phase 1 or 2 clinical trial assessing the immunogenicity of LAIV may focus on persons with low or absent levels of preexisting immunity to the candidate vaccine (Keitel et al., 1993b).

Clinical trials of vaccines that potentially could be transmitted to others in the community raise special concerns.

For most phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials of vaccines, the subjects are randomized to receive one of several dosage levels of vaccine or placebo. Ideally, randomization should not occur until the subjects have been qualified for participation. Typically the randomization occurs in blocks of a prespecified number that represents a multiple of the number of test articles. For example, if there were four dosage levels of vaccine and a placebo, then the block size might be 5, 10, or 15. If the block size chosen were 5, then the subjects would be randomized 1:1:1:1:1. Block randomization can reduce the risk of unequal group sizes. In some circumstances the probability of receiving one product differs from the probability of receiving another. For example, in an efficacy study to be conducted in children, an investigator may wish to reduce the number of subjects randomized to receive the placebo, and the randomization scheme selected may be 2:1 (vaccine:placebo). The vaccine group assignments for subjects should be concealed from the subjects and from investigators to reduce bias in the assessments performed after vaccination (so-called double blinding). Additional measures can be taken to reduce the potential for imbalances in baseline characteristics of enrolled subjects, such as stratification of subjects according to age, prior receipt of a related vaccine, etc., prior to randomization.",

SAEs include death, life-threatening events, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomalies, and events that result in permanent disability. Each AE and SAE that is recorded should be assessed for its severity and relationship to vaccination. The grading of AEs is usually based on the interference with activity, where 1=mild, does not interfere with usual activities; 2=moderate, interferes somewhat with usual activities; and 3=severe, incapacitating. The severity grading system of laboratory abnormalities should be established before the initiation of the trial. The FDA has suggested guidelines for toxicity grading scale for healthy adults and adolescents enrolled in vaccine clinical trials (FDA, 2007b).",

Conscientious supervision of clinical trial activities is a shared responsibility of the investigators, the IRB, the sponsor, the CRO, the DCC, the safety oversight committee, and all other partners who are participating in the trial. While meticulous attention to detail and strict protocol compliance are essential, the entire study team must be flexible and prepared to respond in a timely fashion to unexpected findings.
