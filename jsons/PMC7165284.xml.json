In addition, the majority of them are diagnosed at advanced clinical stages impairing tremendously the prognosis3. In the last decades, many strategies have been used attempting to modify this scenario. Educational campaigns targeted at the general population regarding the risk factors, the main clinical features and what to do when a suspicious oral lesion is observed are among of the most emphasized topics. Political decisions, such as the anti-smoking law number 12.546/2011 instituted in 2011 by the Brazilian Government prohibiting smoking in closed places as restaurants and pubs also had a significant effect on risk reduction. Another important measure aiming to reduce the incidence a well as to improve the proportion of oral cancers diagnosed at early stages are the screening campaigns particularly focusing people with known history of risk factors, specially tobacco and alcohol intake4.",

Clinical images, radiographs, computed tomography, histopathology reports can be evaluated and tumor board conferences can be performed. The American Academy for Otolaryngology \u2013 Head and Neck Surgery are willing to aid physicians to use this technology. In the time of COVID-19, this tool gained special attention10. Telemedicine has been used also for diagnosing oral lesions. In this context, Carrard et al. (2018)11 evaluated the participation of 71 dentists and 18 physicians from primary care services and observed that the intention to refer patients to face-to-face consultation reduced from 96.95% to 35.1%.",

In this way, only patients with highly suspicious malignant lesions would be referred to the oral medicine team in order to undergo clinical examination and appropriate procedures, such as an incisional biopsy. After sending the specimen to the oral pathology laboratory, there is also a risk of diagnostic delay because it is expected that many are working partially. Consequently, there is also a possibility of delay on the referral to head and neck surgeon. During COVID-19 pandemic, patients will face another challenge that is the performance of medical exams necessary for cancer staging and treatment planning. Hospitals will be overcrowded very soon, and an available beds and intensive units for post-operative recovery will become uncommon. Even though it is a multifactorial challenging scenario, telemedicine in Oral Medicine has potential to, at least in part, support clinicians and patients and consequently contributes to reduce futile hospital visits and help preserving the resources for the most needed during this preoccupant period.",
