            "text": "on the host cell exocytic pathway because of the extensive use of intracellular membranes for assembly of replication complexes and viral particles. MHV utilizes the ER to generate membrane-associated replication complexes, termed double membrane vesicles, 1 and to assemble progeny virus particles. We hypothesized that this extensive use of the ER induces the unfolded protein response. The UPR is a multifaceted signaling pathway that is triggered by perturbations in the normal ER environment (reviewed in Ref. 2) . The UPR emanates from the ER membrane and has the capacity to increase expression of ER resident chaperones and folding enzymes, to facilitate disposal of misfolded protein, to downregulate protein synthesis, to regulate production of membrane components necessary for expansion of the secretory pathway, and to regulate both cell cycle progression and cell death. Recently, investigators have reported that hepatitis C virus 5 of the UPR, the Ire1-XBP1 pathway, leads to increased ER chaperone levels, upregulation of lipid biosynthesis, and alterations in protein degradation and synthesis, all of which might influence MHV replication. We found that MHV infection activates induces Ire1-mediated splicing of XBP1 mRNA, thereby resulting in synthesis of the active transcription factor, XBP1(S). To investigate the role of the Ire1-XBP1 pathway in MHV infection, we used RNA interference to generate XBP1-silenced cell lines (XBP1si). As expected, XBP1si cells exhibited reduced levels of XBP1 mRNA during MHV infection; however, XBP1(S) protein accumulated in the MHV-infected XBP1si cells. These data indicate that MHV infection is a potent activator of the Ire1/XBP1 pathway and suggest that XBP1(S) protein is stabilized in MHV-infected cells. Future studies will determine if MHV replication regulates the function of XBP1(S) as a transcriptional activator. ",

Therefore, we wanted to determine if knocking down the level of XBP1 mRNA would have an effect on MHV replication. To reduce the level of XBP1 mRNA in cells, we generated a stable cell line, designated XBPsi, that expresses a shRNA targeting XBP1 for RNAimediated degradation (as described in \"Materials and Methods\"). To test whether the XBP1si cells efficiently reduced steady-state levels of XBP1 mRNA, we compared the levels of XBP1 mRNA in untreated cells and cells treated with tunicamycin for 6 or 12 hours (Fig. 1 ). Northern blot analysis shows that XBP1 mRNA levels are induced by treatment with tunicamycin in DBT cells and control cells. In contrast, the XBP1si cell line has reduced amounts of XBP1 mRNA under all conditions tested. Furthermore, the mRNA level of the XBP1-responsive gene, ERdj4 is also reduced in the XBP1si cell line (Fig. 1, center panel) . Overall, we conclude that the XBP1si cell line has reduced levels of XBP1 mRNA and exhibits reduced levels of mRNA of XBP1 responsive genes such as ERdj4 after tunicamycin treatment.

We hypothesized that if MHV activation of the Ire1/XBP1 pathway was beneficial to replication, then reduced levels of XBP1 mRNA and protein may inhibit or delay MHV RNA synthesis. XBP1si and control cells were infected with MHV-A59 at MOI 1, RNA was isolated at hourly intervals after infection, and the level of MHV nucleocapsid mRNA was measured by real-time RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2a) . We found that the level of MHV replication (as monitored by accumulation of nucleocapsid RNA) was delayed in the XBP1si cells (6-and 8-hour time points), but ultimately rose to the same level as detected in the control cells (10-and 12-hour time points). Furthermore, the production of virus particles detected in the supernatant was essentially identical from the two cell lines (data not shown). To determine if the Ire1/XBP1 pathway was activated in the XBP1si cells, we generated whole cell lysates and performed Western blotting to examine the level of XBP1(S) protein. Surprisingly, we detected XBP1(S) in both MHV-infected control and MHV-infected XBP1si cells (Fig. 2b) . One possible explanation for the presence of the XBP1(S) protein in the XBP1-silenced cells would be that silencing was diminished by MHV infection. To determine if MHV infection affected the level of silencing, we measured the level of XBP1 mRNA in control and XBP1si cell during the time course of MHV infection (Fig. 2c) . We found that the silencing of XBP1 was maintained throughout the time course of MHV infection. Therefore, MHV infection does not impede the silencing of the XBP1 mRNA. Overall, we found that MHV infection is a potent inducer of the Ire1/XBP1 pathway of the UPR and that XBP1(S) protein is detected during MHV infection, even in XBP1si cell lines where the XBP1 mRNA concentration is reduced. These data suggest that XBP1(S), typically a short-lived protein, is stabilized in MHV-infected cells.",
