The patient was a man aged 68 years who had travelled to the Middle East (Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar) from April 18, to May 3, 2015, and developed symptoms on his return to South Korea on May 11, 2015. This case could have passed unnoticed, since individual cases of MERS have been reported from all continents without major subsequent secondary spread. However, the subsequent major outbreak in Seoul, with 30 MERS cases (two deaths) reported as of June 3, is the largest case cluster of MERS outside the Middle East and a major cause for concern. This outbreak gives us an opportunity to reflect on progress on global efforts being made to control MERS coronavirus since it was first detected in a patient who had died from a severe respiratory illness in June, 2012, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.2\n",

The Korean hospital cluster2 and the export of an active case to China3 emphasises the importance of maintaining stringent hospital infection control and prevention measures. These measures include isolation of the index patient in a negative-pressure room or a well ventilated room, droplet and contact precaution with eye protection when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS coronavirus infection, and airborne precautions when performing aerosol generating procedures.6 For the hospital infection control and isolation system to function effectively, it is important to maintain administrative controls (such as careful triage of patients, separation of potentially infectious cases from other patients in waiting rooms in the emergency area), environmental controls (such as ensuring a clean environment with adequate ventilation and spatial separation), and compliance with appropriate personal protection equipment (such as gloves, gowns, eye protection, surgical masks, and respirators).7\n",

Of major concern is that the first case of MERS was reported almost 3 years ago, and yet the disease remains a serious health threat to the global community, with many basic questions remaining unanswered.10 Phylogenetic analysis of MERS coronavirus isolates from human beings show that camels and bats are reservoirs for MERS coronavirus, but the exact mode of transmission to human beings remains unknown and only a few people infected with MERS have had contact with camels. The absence of such crucial information has made it difficult to develop effective interventions to reduce the risk of disease transmission, define the epidemiology of the disease, and develop effective public health control measures. Importantly, the natural history, risk factors, pathogenesis, viral virulence, viral kinetics, duration of infectiousness, protective immune responses, optimum management, and prognostic factors remain unknown. This information is required for the development and evaluation of new biomarkers, diagnostics, drugs, adjunct therapies, and vaccines.9, 10\n",

Such mutations would increase the risk of a pandemic, especially since several million pilgrims travel throughout the year from all continents to Saudi Arabia, with much of this travel associated with the Hajj and Umrah. Fortunately, no increase in MERS cases related to the Hajj has been reported.11 As with Ebola virus disease, no specific or effective drug treatment or vaccine exists for MERS.

The persistence of MERS coronavirus infections in the Middle East and its continuing spread to other countries 3 years after it was first detected points to a global failure by governments and public health systems to adequately assess and respond to such threats. Proper risk assessment and communication procedures necessary to define and control the outbreaks are inadequate, and a coordinated action plan to tackle MERS is sorely needed. With increasing numbers of novel and re-emerging infectious diseases which threaten global health security,13, 14 the time has now come for governments and global public health bodies to show bold leadership by establishing national, regional and pan-continental capacities for rapid conduct of research based on equitable partnerships to generate the best evidence base for formulating effective public health, infection control and treatment interventions14 required to effectively tackle these infections.",
