Lack of knowledge about the natural progression of upper airway infections, poor validation of the clinical history, the physical examination and epidemiological data are associated with the excessive use of antibiotics. There are also other equally important factors that lead to the abusive use of medication, such as the low predictive value of clinical signs to differentiate viral from bacterial tonsillitis, the absence of easy and low cost laboratory tests for diagnosing upper airway infections etiologically, difficulty in accessing medical services (which generates insecurity about the risk of complications), false expectations that antibiotics used in viral upper airway infections will avoid future complications, and difficulties in interpreting radiological exams, which may not help differentiate viral sinusitis from bacterial or allergic sinusitis.4, 5\n",

Use of the antibiotic did not decrease the symptoms or the complication rate, regardless of whether the children had confirmed or unconfirmed GABHS infection. However, in 96 children (60%) that had positive oropharyngeal cultures for GABHS and that were not treated with antibiotics, there was a higher recurrence rate of tonsillitis. It may be possible that the low complication detection rate was associated with the small sample size and a low prevalence in that country of nephrogenic strains or those associated with rheumatic fever. Thus, an inadequate diagnosis and treatment of streptococcal tonsillitis may increase the risk in regions where there is a high prevalence of rheumatic fever.8\n",

Although there are few benefits in avoiding the symptoms of tonsillitis, early therapy drastically reduces the transmission of strains causing rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis. The risk of GABHS transmission in closed environments (households or schools) is high (35%); this risk fall markedly within 24 hours of penicillin therapy. On the other hand, early treatment of streptococcal infection is associated with a lower serological response and an increased recurrence rate of this infection.13\n",

            "text": "Little et al. (2006)40 monitored 315 children aged from 6 months to 10 years during one year, which had been randomized into a prompt antibiotic therapy group and a conservative approach group (WASP, or giving antibiotics only if symptoms persisted or worsened regardless of analgesics) for the treatment of acute otitis media. The short-term, 3-month and 12-month progression was similar in both groups, except for children with two or more previous episodes of acute otitis media. Among these children there were more recurrences of otalgia in the first three months (39% vs. 10%), but the number of sequelae one year later was not different from the groups of children treated with antibiotics. These data suggest that prompt antibiotic therapy does not alter the progression of acute otitis media.40\n",

In areas where the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant strains is high, use of wide-spectrum antibiotics, such as cephalosporins and macrolides, is becoming more and more common. Dosages and duration of treatment also vary; some studies have indicated that cephalosporins or azithromycin during 3 to 5 days may be as effective as 10 days of amoxicillin, with a higher probability of adhesion to the treatment.13, 44, 45, 46, 47 Many of these recommendations have been based on studies that used double tympanocentesis to assess whether the bacteria had been eradicated from the middle ear; furthermore, these studies have taken place in countries where the prevalence of bacterial resistance is high.",
