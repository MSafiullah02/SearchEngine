The ORF2 and ORF3 encode two structural proteins that are, respectively, the VP1, which is the major capsid protein, and the VP2, a minor structural protein that is responsible for the virus genome packaging. The VP1 is functionally divided into shell (S) and protrusion (P) domains.

A fourth ORF, tentatively named virulence factor Based on the complete deduced amino acid (aa) sequence of the VP1 capsid protein, NoVs are classified into six genogroups (GI-GVI) with the proposed seventh genogroup (GVII) (Vinje 2015) .
