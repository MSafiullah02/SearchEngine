To some, it may seem like a neutral term referring to the physical origin of the virus. To many others, however, the term is in fact attaching ethnicity to the virus. In this paper, we attempt to shed light on the term's real-world usage on Twitter. Using sentiment feature analysis and topic modeling, we reveal substantial differences between the use of the controversial terms such as \"Chinese virus\" and that of the non-controversial terms such as \"COVID-19\". For example, tweets using controversial terms contain a higher percentage of anger as well as negative emotions. They also point to China more frequently. Our results suggest that while the term \"Chinese virus\" could be interpreted either as neutral or racist, its usage on social media leans strongly towards the latter.",

Nevertheless, such words have provoked, to certain degree, racist or xenophobic opinions and hate speeches towards China or people with Chinese ethnicity on social media. Furthermore, hate speeches can spread extremely fast on online social media platforms and can stay online for a long time [3] . Gagliardone et al. [3] found that such speeches are also itinerant, meaning that despite forcefully removed by the platforms, one can still find related expression elsewhere on the Internet and even offline. Fig. 1 shows 4 summary variables for CD and ND. We observe that the clout scores for CD and ND are similar. A high clout score suggests that the author is speaking from the perspective of high expertise [8] . At the same time, analytical thinking, authentic and emotional tones scores for ND are higher than those for CD. The analytical thinking score reflects the degree of hierarchical thinking. Higher numbers indicate a more logical and formal thinking [8] . A higher authentic score suggests that the content of the text is more honest, personal and disclosing [8] . The emotional tones scores for CD and ND are both lower than 50, indicating that the overall emotions for CD and ND are negative. This is consistent with our expectation. However, the emotional tone score for ND is higher than that for CD, indicating that the Twitter users in ND are expressing a relatively more positive emotion. Fig. 2 shows 12 more detailed linguistic variables of tweets of CD and ND. The scores of \"future-oriented\" and \"pastoriented\" reflect the temporal focus of attention of the Twitter users by analyzing the verb tense used in the tweets [9] . The tweets of ND are more future-oriented, while those of CD are more past-oriented. To better understand this difference, we conducted a similar analysis as Gunsch et al. [4] . We extract five more linguistic variables including four pronouns score and one time orientation score. The scores of \"i\", \"we\", \"she/he\", \"they\", and present-orientation are shown in Table II . The tweets of CD show more other-references (\"they\"), whereas more self-references (\"i\", \"we\") are present in the tweets of ND. The scores for \"she/he\" of CD and ND are close. The score of present orientation of CD is higher than that of ND. From this similar observation to the findings of Gunsch et al. [4] , we can infer that the tweets of CD focus on the past and present actions of the others, and the tweets of ND focus more on the future acts of themselves. Research shows that LIWC can identify the emotion in language use [9] . From the aforementioned discussion, the tweets of both CD and ND are expressing a negative emotion, and the emotion expressed by the Twitter users of ND is relatively more positive. This is consistent with the positive emotions score and negative emotions score. However, there are nuanced differences across the sadness, anxiety and anger scores. When referring to COVID-19, the tweets of ND express more sadness and anxiety than those of CD do. More anger is expressed through the tweets of CD. The certainty and tentativeness scores reveal the extent to which the event the author is going through may have been established or is still being formed [9] .",

            "text": "A higher percentage of words like \"always\" or \"never\" results in a higher score for certainty, and a higher percentage of words like \"maybe\" or \"perhaps\" leads to a higher score for tentativeness [8] . We observe a higher tentative score and a higher certainty score for the tweets of CD, while these two scores for the tweets of ND are both lower. We have an interesting hypothesis for this subtle difference. Since 1986, Pennebaker et al. [8] have been collecting text samples from a variety of studies including blogs, expressive writing, novels, natural speech, New York Times, and Twitter to get a sense of the degree to which language varies across settings. Of all the studies, the tentative and certainty scores for the text of New York Times are the lowest. However, these two scores for expressive writing, blog, and natural speech are relatively higher. This observation leads to our hypothesis that the tweets of CD are more like blog, expressive writing, or natural speech that focus on expressing ideas, whereas the tweets of ND are more like newspaper articles which focus more one describing facts. As for the score of \"achievement\", McClelland [7] found that the stories people told in response to drawings of people could provide important clues to their needs for achievement. We hypothesize that the higher value of the \"achievement\" score for the tweets of ND reflects the need of these Twitter users to succeed in fighting against COVID-19. As for the personal concerns, the scores for \"work\" and \"money\" of ND are both higher than those of CD which shows that the Twitter users of ND focus more on the work and money issue (e.g. working from home, unemployment). According to the reports of the U.S. Department of Labor, the advance seasonally adjusted insured unemployment rate was 8.2% for the week ending April 4. The previous high was 7.0% in May of 1975. 10 ",

We first use LDA to extract topics from the controversial and non-controversial posts crawled from Twitter, and then qualitatively compare them across the two sets of posts. We find that topics in the controversial posts are more related to China, even after the keywords related to \"Chinese virus\" were removed before the analysis, whereas discussions in noncontroversial posts are more related to fighting the pandemic in the US. We also find differences across the sentiment of the tweets posted by the users using controversial terms and the users using non-controversial terms. Both groups express a negative emotion, yet the tweets of ND are relatively more positive. The tweets of ND also show more analytical thinking and are expressed in a more truthful manner. The tweets of CD focus more on the past and present action of others, while the tweets of ND focus more on the future acts of the authors themselves. More anger is present in the tweets of CD, while more anxiety and sadness are observed in the tweets of ND. 10 https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf More tentativeness and certainty are observed in the tweets of CD, which is not contradictory since these two scores are both higher in the text samples from blogs and expressive writings that focus on expressing ideas and opinions. These two scores are both lower for the tweets of ND which is similar to the case of newspaper articles like New York Times. Tweets of ND reflect a strong need for achievement. As for the personal concerns, users of ND focus more on work and money issues.",
