For humans they can be responsible for mild respiratory infections (like cold) and also for much more serious diseases (like Severe acute respiratory syndrome \u2013SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome \u2013 MERS). Recently, in December 2019 an alarm emerged in the city of Wuhan, China, for a new viral pneumonia infection due to a novel coronavirus, falling within the genus Betacoronavirus, that was traced to a seafood wholesale market and named as SARS-CoV-2. Preliminary analysis revealed that different SARS-CoV-2 sequenced genomic strains exhibit more than 99.98% sequence identity, and they are closely related (88% identity) to bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses, while they are more distant from human SARS-CoV (about 79%) and human MERS-CoV (about 50%) (Lu et al., 2020).",

By now (middle of February 2020) there are more than 2000 dead and more than seventy thousand infected in China. In this view the rapid development of a vaccine is a focal issue to avoid pandemics. According to the new paradigm of reverse vaccinology (Rappuoli, 2001) identification of epitopes, able to trigger an immune response against pathogens, is the fundamental step to develop effective new vaccine.",

In particular, the core of the proposed methodology is based on the selection of viral peptides that are more than three mutation steps far from human self. In other terms we selected those high order nullomers, i.e. viral peptides that are absent in human (simple nullomers (Hampikian and Andersen, 2007)), such that all the peptides obtained by mutating any three aminoacids of them are still absent. As highlighted in (Santoni, 2018) it has been shown that high order nullomers have a higher probability to bind HLA than expected. Moreover, in our opinion, the identification of farthest-from-human peptides could be interesting in the view of vaccine design both for cross-reactivity reasons, since we expect on average an high number of potential antibodies able to recognize them, and for avoiding autoimmunity risks, because of the very low similarity with human self.",
