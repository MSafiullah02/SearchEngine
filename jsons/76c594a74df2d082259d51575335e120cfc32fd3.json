In this study, consensus primer-based reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) and high-throughput sequencing were performed to investigate viruses in bat faecal samples collected at 11 natural bat habitat sites from July to December 2015 in Korea. Diverse coronaviruses were first detected in Korean bat faeces, including alphacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-like and MERS-CoV-like betacoronaviruses. In addition, we identified a novel bat rotavirus belonging to group H rotavirus which has only been described in human and pigs until now. Therefore, our results suggest the need for continuing surveillance and additional virological studies in domestic bat.",

Recently emerging human viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Nipah virus, Hendra virus and Ebola virus, are thought be bat-borne viruses (Han et al., 2015) . In addition, new species of influenza A viruses, lyssaviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses continue to be discovered in bats around the world (Tong et al., 2013; Banyard et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2014; Mortlock et al., 2015) . Reassortant group A rotavirus was also detected in the faeces of a straw-coloured fruit bat (Esona et al., 2010) . Therefore, viruses that originate in bats may be a source of additional spill over from wildlife into domestic animals and humans (Plowright et al., 2015) .",

Most Korean bats are thought to be insectivores, as no fruit bats have been found in Korea to date, except for some fruit bats as pets or indoor exhibitions (Han et al., 2010 (Chu et al., 2008) . As Bat CoVs B15-40 and 41 were also found in faeces in a cave where Miniopterus schreibersii was dominant, Bat CoV strains in the same lineage with Bat CoV 1A and 1B may be adapted to the Miniopterus spp. It was interesting that Bat CoV B15-21 found in this study was closely related to SARS-CoV-like Bat CoVs, such as Bat CoV Rf1, based on the partial RDRP and S genes, respectively. The newly identified Bat CoV B15-21 clustered with the SARS-CoV-like Bat CoV group in the phylogenetic analysis. The major bat species in the site where Bat CoV B15-21 was collected was Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, which is consistent with a previous report that SARS-CoVlike bat CoVs were mostly found in Rhinolophus spp. (Yuan et al., 2010) . The amino acids of its full spike gene showed that the B15-21 strain is closely related to SARS-CoV-like Bat CoVs Rp3, Rf1, HKU3-2 and 273 rather than human SARS-CoVs and Bat CoV RaSHC014, which was reported to have high potential for human emergence (Menachery et al., 2015) and showed two specific deletion sites in the RBD of the spike protein. One additional betacoronavirus (B15-1-6), which was not detected by the consensus primer-based RDRP-specific RT-PCR (Poon et al., 2005) , was detected by high-throughput sequencing as shown in Table 2 . Three contigs were similar to Bat CoV SC2013, which is a MERS-related betacoronavirus that was found in bats in China (Yang et al., 2014) . One contig was also similar to Bat CoV HKU5-5, which clustered with MERS-CoV (Woo et al., 2007; Annan et al., 2013) . Phylogenetic analysis based on partial spike gene sequences of Bat CoV B15-1-6 showed that it belonged to a MERS-CoV-like clade with previously known MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV-like Bat CoVs.",
