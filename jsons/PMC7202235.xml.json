Williams\u2019 writings on the evolution of senescence and life histories provided fundamental conceptual developments in evolutionary biology (Williams 1957), as did his thoughts on the role of natural selection in adaptive evolution on multiple levels from genes to individuals to groups of organisms (Williams 1966). Further, his work in collaboration with Randolph Nesse spurred interest in applying evolutionary biology to medicine and public health. The essay on \u201cThe Dawn of Darwinian Medicine\u201d (Williams and Nesse 1991) and the book \u201cWhy We Get Sick\u201d (Nesse and Williams 1994) are cornerstones of the synthesis between evolutionary biology and the biomedical sciences. Williams\u2019 work inspired research projects, articles, and books that have further addressed the many ways that evolutionary biology influences biomedical research and how an evolutionary approach can improve medical diagnostics and therapies (e.g., a special issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science featuring presentations from a Sackler Symposium, held in April 2009 (Stearns et al. 2010); a special issue of Evolution: Education and Outreach originating in part from the SSE 2011 Evolutionary Medicine Symposium (Jenkins and Antolin 2011).",

It describes core scientific competencies that should be taught during premedical training and in medical school, and explicitly covers evolutionary biology, genetics, and genomics (download the full report from http://www.hhmi.org/grants/pdf/08209_AAMC-HHMI_report.pdf). Nesse et al. (2010) substantially expand on these core competencies and provide further recommendations for integrating evolutionary biology into medical education. The \u201cFuture Physicians\u201d report makes the case that because scientific knowledge and medical practice continually grow in response to new discoveries, one goal of medical school must be to train doctors to integrate and apply new clinical and scientific knowledge into their daily work, and to absorb the \u201cfundamental scientific principles that are key to lifelong learning and biomedical scientific literacy\u201d (AAMC\u2010HHMI 2009, p. 3). As an integrative scientific discipline at the core of the life sciences, evolutionary biology has a role in helping physicians and biomedical researchers understand how the human body works and why it sometimes fails.",

            "text": "Human diseases are in part a reflection of the evolutionary history that shaped our genetic make\u2010up and responses to our current environment, including the parasites and pathogenic microbes that plague us. But understanding evolutionary history provides only one perspective on disease. As pointed out by Ernst Mayr (1961) and Niko Tinbergen (1963), traits have both proximate and ultimate causes (see also Nesse and Williams 1994). Proximately, diseases arise from combinations of biochemical, physiological, and immunological responses of individuals to the environment and to pathogens. In this sense, disease can be defined mechanistically in terms of malfunctions, disorders, anatomical flaws, and infections that cause morbidity and/or death. Ultimately, however, the causes of diseases can be explained in three parts\u2014by ancestry and common descent of organisms, by variation in the environment over time, and by ongoing genomic and evolutionary forces (Williams and Nesse 1991; Nesse and Williams 1994; Nesse and Stearns 2008). A key to understanding vulnerability to disease is that adaptive evolution increases fitness in terms of reproductive success, and not health, over many generations. Natural selection will compromise health and survival if that increases overall reproductive success, and natural selection may not keep pace with the rapid or recent environmental changes in industrial and postindustrial societies.",

            "text": "The viewpoint that diseases are shaped by both proximate and ultimate causes represents one of the central concepts underlying evolutionary medicine. It is important to recognize that evolution may not act to shape disease per se, but rather that evolution acts on traits that mediate vulnerability to disease. For example, the potential to form cancers is an inherent risk of multicellularity. Moreover, symptoms such as vomiting and fever may actually be defenses against disease by reducing the effects of pathogens. Legacies of evolutionary history, including interactions between an individual's genetic susceptibilities, immune system responses, and environmental exposure to poor nutrition, toxins, and pathogens, are important ultimate explanations for disease. Ongoing natural selection may also influence disease, for example, through the genomic mechanisms that underlie many cancers or parent\u2013parent and parent\u2013offspring conflicts for resources. These conflicts begin with different genomic contributions by the parents, and continue through prenatal development and into childhood. Further, human bodies are not optimally designed, but represent a series of developmental, biophysical, and physiological compromises driven by trade\u2010offs that contribute to risks of injury and disease. On another level, natural selection acts rapidly on microbes via their short generation times and high mutation rates, and microbes rapidly evolve resistance to immune defenses, drugs, and vaccines, often with tragic consequences. The evolutionary approach to the health sciences has clear implications for research on the prevalence of disease within human populations, improved public health practice, and ultimately more effective care for the sick (Nesse and Stearns 2008; Stearns and Koella 2008; Wolfe et al. 2007; Omenn 2010).",

            "text": "The goal of biology courses, from introductory to advanced, is twofold: for students to learn how to think scientifically, and for students to master content in biology. Understanding the nature and process of science informs personal and policy decisions, with local, regional, and global impacts, and some knowledge of biology can be helpful for everyone in making life decisions. Education research suggests that one way to support those goals is to teach with key concepts such as biological evolution (Bransford et al. 2000; Ambrose et al. 2010). This \u201cbig picture\u201d approach helps students build a reference framework to categorize information, which facilitates building connections between new and old content, and improves student retention and ability to transfer information. The ability to categorize and connect information is one of the traits that enable experts to navigate easily through disciplinary content. The AP Biology revisions (College Board 2011) and the Vision and Change report (NSF/AAAS 2011) emphasize teaching key concepts including evolution. Evolution is an excellent theme for teaching about the nature of science (National Academy of Sciences 1998), and a poor understanding of the nature of science is correlated with a low acceptance and understanding of evolution (Johnson and Peeples 1987). Undergraduate biology educators can serve all their students well by introducing an evolutionary view into their courses, beginning with introductory biology.",

As we show below, applying basic evolutionary principles to human health leads to interesting, novel, and useful conclusions. Students who are not typically excited by basic evolutionary concepts may be drawn in by focusing on human health. Exploring the research behind theories such as the \u201cstone age diet\u201d and the hygiene hypothesis gives students an accessible entry to discovering the nature and process of science. In particular, this approach demonstrates that premedical students should learn evolutionary biology for the same reasons they study biochemistry, physics, and mathematics\u2014because broad scientific knowledge gives future medical practitioners the tools to understand how a patient may have developed sets of symptoms, and how to best to treat the patient.",

The just\u2010released (November 2011) preview of the revised MCAT\u00ae for 2015 specifically includes evolution in section 1C on Transmission of heritable information from generation to generation and the processes that increase genetic diversity and in section 9A on Understanding social structure (https://www.aamc.org/students/applying/mcat/mcat2015/). Although this is a positive step forward, indicating support from the medical community for increasing evolutionary thinking in medical education, evolution biology is still not listed as one of the \u201cFoundations of Living Systems\u201d or integrated throughout the lists of life sciences topics to be tested.

In\u2010depth genetic studies generally show that even commonly taught diseases that at first appear to have a relatively simple genetic basis are found to be more complex. Multiple functional and mutant alleles combine with environmental effects to cause variable symptoms and disease severity (Templeton 2006). This is clearly demonstrated by phenylketonuria (PKU), a condition caused by mutations in the single\u2010copy gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxolase and tested for in neonatal health screening. PKU arises from the inability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine, the buildup of the amino acid and phenylketones, and eventually microcephaly, incomplete brain development, seizures, and severe learning disabilities. Although in most cases, disease can be avoided by excluding foods rich in phenylalanine from the diet, the treatment is not equally effective for all variants, and the frequencies of both functional and mutant alleles differ among human populations. This is a familiar problem to evolutionary biologists: although genetic variation is the stuff of evolution, it is seldom straightforward to map genotypic (now genomic) variability onto phenotypic differences between individuals and populations (see Boxes 3 and 4).",

            "text": "Students often miss (or reject) this basic concept in their first introduction to evolution, but examples from evolutionary medicine can help drive this idea home. Common ancestry explains why biomedical research in animals is applicable to humans (Antolin 2009). But some caution is in order, as in the case of differences between humans and mouse strains in the P450 family of enzymes important for drug metabolism, which limits the mouse as a model for drug testing for humans (Nelson et al. 2004). Further, it is important for medical practitioners to be aware that each patient has a different ancestry (evolutionary history), and therefore a different genetic makeup, different reactions to drugs, and often different disease symptoms (Meyer 1999; Omenn 2010). In managing health care, such differences can result in life, death, or long\u2010term disability and morbidity. Individual patients\u2019 presentation of disease will depend on complex interactions at the convergence of patients\u2019 genetic legacies, the evolutionary history of pathogens to which they are exposed, and the environmental context where the patients and pathogens meet. Combining concepts of ancestry with individual\u2010level genetic variation culminates in the newly emerging approach of \u201cpersonalized medicine\u201d (Knight 2009; Costa et al. 2010; Jiang and Wang 2010; see Box 5).",

For example, \u201cdiseases of civilization\u201d imply a mismatch hypothesis: alleles that cause disease in modern times may have been adaptive in the past, but produce traits that are maladaptive (mismatched) under current diet and living conditions. A corollary is that modern humans may be changing their environment more rapidly than potential responses to selection can occur. The mismatch hypothesis provides some of the best ultimate explanations for modern rates of obesity, heart disease, type\u20102 diabetes, breast and prostate cancer, goiter, iodine deficiency, birth defects, and aging (Harper 1975; Eaton et al. 1988; Williams and Nesse 1991; Greaves 2002; Diamond 2003; Swynghedauw 2004; Gluckman et al. 2009).",

As an example, the prevalence of specific allelic variants of the CFTR gene that cause cystic fibrosis, a debilitating and in the long\u2010term fatal genetic disorder, is potentially linked to selection imposed by past outbreaks of tuberculosis (Poolman and Galvani 2007). This is similar to the long\u2010established link between sickle cell anemia in individuals who inherit at least one copy of the S allele of the HBB globin gene, but where heterozygotes have some degree of resistance to malaria (Allison 1954). In addition to leading to better diagnoses and treatments, seeing diseases as unfortunate genetic legacies inherited from the past may also help ameliorate some of the social stigma associated with genetic diseases.",

In health and medicine, phenotypic plasticity may explain why early developmental problems may lead to disease in adults (Bateson et al. 2004). An example of developmental trade\u2010offs leading to disease in later life is increased susceptibility to heart disease in adults related to periods of nutritional deficiencies and slowed growth in fetal development and early childhood. The damage is potentially higher if subsequent weight gain (catch\u2010up growth) is too rapid when better nutrition becomes available. In the case of growth rates and body size, adult heart disease is a cost of rapid growth following nutritional stress, and should be considered during care of low birth weight or premature babies (Bateson et al. 2004; Gluckman et al. 2009).",

This dynamic view of disease accounts for the variability in human\u2010adapted pathogens such as influenza viruses and malaria, where evolutionary escape hinders development of vaccines with long\u2010lasting protection and results in multidrug resistance. Medical practice is directly impacted by rapid evolution of resistance to antimicrobial drugs as well as avoidance of natural and vaccine\u2010induced immunity (Bergstrom and Feldgarden 2007; Nesse and Stearns 2008). Understanding how pathogen variability arises leads to public health interventions that may reduce exposure and limit chains of transmission (Galvani 2003).",

Strachan (1989) first proposed the \u201chygiene hypothesis\u201d that attributed the recent epidemic in asthma, allergy, and other autoimmune diseases to this loss of our old companions (Bach 2002; Osada and Kanazawa 2010). This hypothesis predicts that restoration of helminth infections, or some facsimile thereof, should relieve symptoms of at least some of these diseases. Indeed, in a clinical trial, the majority of Crohn's disease patients who ingested pig whipworm (Trichuris suis) experienced disease remission (Summers et al. 2005), and more studies indicating the utility of helminth infections to treat autoimmune disease have followed (Reddy and Fried 2009). Particularly, striking is the observation that patients with both multiple sclerosis and worm infections experience a much slower development of disease than do those lacking worm infections (Correale and Farez 2007). Finally, our long evolutionary history with pathogens has led to many defensive adaptations, including fever, coughing, and vomiting. Medical practitioners need to be aware of symptoms that are actually defenses, because it is possible that in some cases, treating symptoms may prolong the course of infections and opportunities for pathogen transmission (Williams and Nesse 1994; Carey 2010).",

Darwin had familiarity with links between evolutionary biology and medicine through his grandfather Erasmus Darwin's volume \u201cZoonomia,\u201d which included both a Linnaean classification of disease and a clear statement about transmutation and common descent in nature (Darwin 1801). Darwin also consulted with his father, the physician Robert Waring Darwin, on human heredity and disease (Bynum 1983). The question of heredity was briefly covered issues in the \u201cDescent of Man\u201d (Darwin 1882) and in \u201cVariation of Plants and Animals Under Domestication\u201d (Darwin 1875), along with observations on the similarity of diseases (and responses to medication) in humans and apes, differing disease prevalence among human populations, effects of disease on aboriginal populations coming into contact with Europeans, and sex\u2010limited maladies such as hemophilia and gout. As evolutionary biology developed as a field, various scientists and physicians also advocated for inclusion of evolutionary thinking in medicine (e.g., Huxley 1881; Aitken 1885; Morton 1926; see Zampieri 2009).",

The work of Pasteur, Koch, and others in identifying microbes and the birth of germ theory made it possible to identify the pathogens underlying common diseases such as whooping cough, syphilis, and cholera. Further, industrialization and concentration of human populations in cities created new public health challenges that needed attention (Porter 1998).

The first was related to the previously mentioned \u201cconstitutions,\u201d\u201cdiatheses,\u201d and \u201cdegeneracy\u201d used to explain disease vulnerabilities in certain racial groups and in women. The misapplication of this typologically racist and sexist thinking to disease, which was wrongly tied to evolutionary principles, was largely dealt with by implementation of Flexner's (1910) recommendations. The mechanistic understanding of disease attenuated societal biases of race and gender, although social disparities in the delivery of medical treatment still persist. The second reason was the horrific application of eugenics in the first half of the 20th century culminating in the genocidal Nazi regime in the 1930s and 1940s in Europe (Zampieri 2009). To be sure, eugenics was a malignant social policy that arose from misapplication of the science of evolution, and was discarded by evolutionary biologists after the population genetics of mutation and natural selection were better understood (J. B. S. Haldane [1964] provides an amusing essay defending mathematical theories of population genetics, including the balance between mutation and selection that was overlooked by eugenicists, and some lovely verse about his own life\u2010ending fight with colorectal cancer). But the backlash was severe enough that even today many scientists within biomedical fields do not fully acknowledge how much evolutionary science informs medicine (Antonovics et al. 2007; Nesse and Stearns 2008). The third reason was that the dominant reductionist scientific paradigm advocated by Flexner (1910) trained scientists to reject teleological thinking, which was mistakenly conflated with the process of natural selection, a misunderstanding that persists among some to this day. Currently, few medical schools teach evolutionary topics beyond human genetic variation, drug resistance, pathogen virulence, and adaptation by natural selection (Nesse and Schiffman 2003; Downie 2004; Childs et al. 2005; Harris and Malyango 2005).",

The challenge for educators is to help them think critically about the questions, without getting prematurely discouraged by the substantial challenges of forming and testing evolutionary hypotheses about disease vulnerability. For many questions, such as the adaptive significance of menopause, the unknowns are so substantial that consensus remains elusive despite extensive research. Some may see this as a reason to teach simpler topics. However, students already get plenty of experience memorizing the answers to scientific questions. Topics in evolutionary medicine give them an opportunity to grapple with current questions. Students will tend to latch onto a favorite hypothesis and try to defend it. This gives educators an opportunity to emphasize the importance of considering all possible hypotheses, and strategies for determining which are correct and which are false. In contrast to proximate studies, evolutionary questions often have more than one answer, in the sense that multiple factors may be involved in accounting for a trait. Emphasizing this can help students recognize the need to consider multiple possibilities. In short, topics in evolutionary medicine are well suited to advancing a major goal of modern education\u2014helping students to learn how to formulate hypotheses, how to go about the scientific process of testing them, and how to cope with the inevitable complexity and confusion that attend almost any scientific endeavor.

Classic examples of these patterns include correlations between sickle cell anemia, \u03b2\u2010thalassemia and malaria endemicity (Haldane 1949; Allison 1954), body mass and temperature (Roberts 1978; Katzmarzyk and Leonard 1998), skin pigmentation and solar radiation (Jablonski and Chaplin 2000), and lactase persistence and dairying (Simoons 1969). For several of these examples, the genetic variants underlying these patterns are now known (Enattah et al. 2002; Lamason et al. 2005; Sulem et al. 2007; Tishkoff et al. 2007; Piel et al. 2010). Using genome\u2010wide data, it is now possible to turn this approach around to scan the human genome to identify genetic variants that correlate with predicted environmental selective pressures, even without knowing the phenotypic adaptations that may drive the associations between specific alleles and the environment. Association studies of this kind have been carried out for variation related to climate, subsistence, diet, and pathogen diversity (Fumagalli et al. 2010; Hancock et al. 2010; Hancock et al. 2011). Integrating results from these environmental genome scans with studies of genotype\u2013phenotype association and other sources reveals the relationships between disease risk and adaptation to the environment. For example, scans show that alleles correlated with diet and subsistence influence folate and energy metabolism. In addition, among genes with strong correlation with climate, many have alleles or genotypes implicated in traits such as pigmentation phenotypes and other aspects of ultraviolet radiation response, cardiovascular disease, immune response, and cancer. Together with ongoing efforts to identify variants associated with disease phenotypes in diverse populations (Rosenberg et al. 2010), environmental genome scans and scans for adaptive genetic loci can identify the genetic variants that underlie differences in disease susceptibility among populations (e.g., Nielsen et al. 2009; Pickrell et al. 2009; Grossman et al. 2010).",

Part of the answer however may lie in our genes and thus in our evolutionary history. For example, broad patterns of population structure among humans are largely the result of ancient demographic events. The bottleneck during the Out of Africa exodus of modern humans about 50,000 years ago contributed substantially to reduced heterozygosity in individuals living outside of Africa and remains the most remarkable demographic imprint reflected in their genomes (Cavalli\u2010Sforza and Feldman 2003). In contrast, fine\u2010scale population structure stems from recent demographic processes, reflecting local mating within populations living in geographically circumscribed locations. The impact of inbreeding on the frequency of rare diseases has been demonstrated in historically isolated groups, such as the Ashkenazi Jewish population (Reich and Lander 2001). If geographic regions throughout the world are finely structured, as suggested by global genomic surveys (Auton et al. 2009), it may be predicted that populations in some regions harbor disease\u2010risk alleles that are population specific and otherwise rare in humans. For example, Acu\u00f1a\u2010Alonzo et al. (2010) recently reported that a novel cholesterol transporter ABCA1 gene variant (R230C, rs9282541) is exclusive to Native Americans and has been associated with low levels of high\u2010density lipoprotein (HDL), obesity and type 2 diabetes in admixed populations in Mexico (Villarreal\u2010Molina et al. 2008). The authors also identified signatures of positive natural selection around the ABCA1 variant, suggesting that R230C carriers could have had a selective advantage during the initial peopling of the Americas. Because the C230 ABCA1 protein shows decreased cholesterol efflux, the presence of this variant could favor intracellular cholesterol and energy storage, conferring an advantage during severe famine periods. However, under current westernized lifestyle, this allele may have become a major susceptibility allele for low HDL\u2010C levels and other metabolic traits. It becomes clear that genetic variation observed today, including medically relevant variation, is the consequence of the interplay between different evolutionary forces acting over time during human population history. Therefore, medical students would benefit from learning evolution theory, as it will allow them to better understand genomic variation and its implications in health and disease.",

It is not a single disease, but an ensemble of diseases with common principles. All cancers harbor groups of cells that show uncontrolled growth, invasion of neighboring tissues, and metastasis to distant organs (Hanahan and Weinberg 2011). Ultimately, most cancers cases result in death. Cancer arises via accumulation of mutations and selection\u2014a case of aberrant evolution of somatic cells during the lifetime of the host, although instances of transmissible cancer are also known (Murgia et al. 2006). Although somatic cells in healthy individuals often harbor many mutations without any apparent consequences (De 2011), cancer cells carry specific mutations that result in immortality, uncontrolled growth, and the ability to metastasize (Hanahan and Weinberg 2011). Many of the key mutagenic processes that are active in cancer cells also operate in germ\u2010line evolution, which together with selection, gives rise to population\u2010 and species\u2010level divergence in genomes over thousands or millions of years. Moreover, many of the genes and pathways associated with cancer are also present in other organisms such as yeast or fruit flies. For instance, the first discovery of a class of cancer genes, the rat sarcoma (RAS) family, was in rat (Harvey 1964; Kirsten et al. 1970). Therefore, much can learned about the mechanistic bases of cancer, and we may exploit weakness of cancer cells to develop better diagnostic and prognostic strategies by borrowing knowledge from germ line evolution. Genetically modified animals provide insights into cancer\u2010related biological processes; and even today we test new cancer drugs on mice for efficacy and side effects before prescribing them to human patients. We are now moving into an era of personalized diagnostics and treatment, which will require low cost, rapid analysis using more minimal biological samples more than ever before.

Molecular mechanisms of evolution have produced differential resistance or susceptibility to infectious agents, including malaria, plague, smallpox, TB, measles, and diarrheal and respiratory diseases. The domestication of sheep and cattle has selected for humans able to digest milk throughout life through persistence into adulthood of lactase enzyme expression in the intestine, a major story of anthropology (Itan et al. 2009). The emergence of a \u201cWestern diet\u201d of dairy, refined cereal grains, refined sugars, vegetable oils, alcoholic beverages, salt, and omega\u20106\u2010rich meats has dramatically altered glycemic load, fatty acid composition, macronutrients, acid\u2010base balance, sodium/potassium ratio, and fiber content. The results include epidemics of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, certain cancers, and bowel, inflammatory, and autoimmune disorders (Cordain et al. 2005).

Conversely, there is little pressure against hemostasis and thrombosis because deaths resulting from blood clots and coronary disease associated with hemostasis and thrombosis occur mostly after the reproductive years of life (Coller 1997).

First, the diametric nature of autism versus psychotic\u2010affective conditions is modulated by multiple genetic, genomic, epigenetic, and social\u2010environmental causes based in human brain evolution. Second, this diametric nature may arise from imprinted genes, which can be dysregulated in two opposite directions. The framework makes novel, testable predictions with direct implications for cognitive\u2010behavioral and pharmacological therapy, human evolution, the molecular evolution of psychiatric risk genes, and human brain development. One important prediction, that imprinting is relatively common among genes that underlie risk of autism and schizophrenia, is supported by analyses of data from a recent genome\u2010wide study of imprinted genes in mice (Gregg et al. 2010).",

Recent experiments have shown just how precisely symmetric that division would have to be. Their results suggest that all known organisms must age, for even a bacterium like E. coli divides into two nonidentical cells, one of which contains older parts than the other and ages faster (Stewart et al. 2005). The lineages with the old parts suffer a fitness disadvantage and disappear, and the lineages with the young parts persist. The goal of potential immortality (barring accidents) may also be unattainable if another basic claim of the evolutionary theory of aging remains unrefuted: aging and death result not from a single mechanism that can be repaired but from the diffuse degradation of multiple processes across the entire genome and body (Williams 1957). Repair of one problem will simply reveal the next in line, and that process will repeat hundreds or thousands of times. The byproducts of repair are also expected to connect through trade\u2010offs to costs paid in other traits. Recently, some genes with major effects on aging have been discovered in other organisms, but they are involved in trade\u2010offs with reproductive performance early in life, and whether those trade\u2010offs can be compensated remains to be seen (Stearns 2001a). The evolutionary view of aging is not optimistic about life\u2010extending genetic therapies, but it may provide some needed wisdom about the human condition.",

When antibiotic use is terminated in a community, what happens to antibiotic resistance in the bacterial populations? Given that antibiotic resistance commonly imposes some cost to bacteria that express it, we might predict that when a particular antibiotic is discontinued, resistance to that antibiotic should decline. Although this sometimes occurs (e.g., Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al. 1997), it is by no means guaranteed. Sometimes resistance to the drug persists long afterward. One example is sulfonamide resistance in Great Britain, which has not declined even though sulfonamides were essentially discontinued in the mid\u2010nineties (Bean et al. 2005). Why?",

Because bacteria have haploid genomes and limited opportunities for recombination, most bacteria exhibit strong linkage along the entire circular chromosome. As a result, hitchhiking and related processes are very important. In the process of associated linkage selection, resistance to a new drug arises on a chromosome or plasmid carrying resistance alleles for older drugs. This generates positive linkage disequilibrium between the new and old resistance alleles. Even if an older drug is discontinued, the resistance alleles to this drug may be indirectly favored by selection for resistance to the newer drug. Associated linkage selection can thus explain why older resistant strains are not outcompeted by unrelated sensitive strains: those sensitive strains are less likely to carry resistance to whatever new drugs are currently in use.",

Although resistance mechanisms impose fitness costs, compensatory mutations can ameliorate these costs and restore fitness of a resistant strain\u2014in the absence of the antibiotic\u2014to near that of the sensitive strain (Schrag and Perrot 1996; Andersson and Hughes 2010). An obvious consequence is that compensatory mutations reduce the selective difference between resistant and sensitive strains in the absence of antibiotic use, and thus slow the rate at which sensitive strains are able to replace resistant ones.",

Because it is easy to \u201cget in\u201d to the resistant compensated state in the presence of the antibiotic but difficult to get out in its absence, this phenomenon has been described as an evolutionary lobster trap (Tanaka and Valckenborgh 2011).",

            "text": "Although the negative impacts of rapid microbial evolution are well understood, humanity has turned the evolutionary lability of viruses into a means of fighting disease. \u201cApplied evolution\u201d has been used to generate many live\u2010attenuated virus vaccines, including those against measles, mumps, rubella, varicella (chickenpox), influenza, and poliovirus (FDA 2011). In this classical approach, pioneered by Pasteur in his effort to create a rabies vaccine, wild\u2010type virulent viruses are serially passaged in a novel host or in a novel temperature regime. The resulting adaptations to the new environments results in loss of fitness in the original host (Plotkin 2001). A successfully attenuated virus shows decreased virulence in humans while retaining the ability to stimulate an immune response. This process can require as few as 28 passages, as for the varicella vaccine (Takahashi et al. 2008), or hundreds, as was needed for the yellow fever vaccine (Monath et al. 2008). However, one of the drawbacks of classical vaccine design is that the phenotype of the virus, that is, its attenuation, determines genotype. Thus, although it is clearly desirable to secure attenuation by multiple or large attenuating mutations (Burch et al. 2003), the mutations responsible for attenuation of many live\u2010attenuated virus vaccines are either unknown or, in the case of the three strains of the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) (Kew et al. 2005), few in number.",

Revertant strains may be transmissible between humans and thus threaten the success of the global effort to eradicate polio. In contrast, the nasal influenza vaccine carries attenuating mutations on four of its eight genomic segments, and to date has never reverted to virulence within a vaccinee (Tosh et al. 2008). Fortunately, reverse genetics (rational vaccine design) informed by evolutionary thinking suggest novel approaches to safeguard the attenuation of live vaccine viruses. For example, Vignuzzi et al. (2008) have attenuated poliovirus by enhancing the fidelity of its RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase and thereby slowing its mutation rate. Because this virus is less likely to mutate, it is less likely to revert to a less\u2010faithful, and more fit, polymerase. Finally, live vaccines may not only evolve themselves but may also shape the evolution of their wild\u2010type counterparts. There is evidence that some veterinary vaccines are driving the evolution of antigens in their wild\u2010type targets (Park et al. 2011), but the impacts of such evolution on virulence and transmission are not yet known. At the extreme, vaccines have the potential to eradicate their wild\u2010type targets, potentially creating an empty niche into which new viruses may emerge from human or zoonotic reservoirs (Rieder et al. 2001; Rimoin et al. 2010; Vasilakis et al. 2011).",
