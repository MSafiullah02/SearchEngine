The dramatic reductions in throughput of cases, with the notable exceptions of cancer resections and major emergency surgery, have had profound effects on the service. The figures for patients awaiting a colorectal clinic appointment do not appear to be dramatic because a preplanned reconfiguration of outpatient services occurred during SARS which saw new routine colorectal cases deflected to another hospital in the region. In many cases, nonurgent surgery was postponed indefinitely to ensure priority was given to those with life-threatening diseases. Consequently, most patients requiring minor or intermediate elective procedures such as haemorrhoidectomy and fistulotomy will wait more than 18 months for surgery. Colorectal trainees suffered a reduction in exposure to cases, affecting both clinical and operative experience. The latter was not reciprocated by an increase in supervision by seniors despite the reduction in the workload for the unit. Basic surgical trainees suffered most by a drastic reduction in the minor, intermediate and elective cases. Participation in the major cases was discouraged due to the high risk of contracting SARS during operative or endoscopic procedures, while instruction was further hampered by the selfcontained ventilation systems used for surgical or endoscopic attire (see Fig. 2 ). Colonoscopy turnover was further hampered by non-attendance, barrier precautions and prolonged endoscope cycling times, but we have not measured these factors.",
