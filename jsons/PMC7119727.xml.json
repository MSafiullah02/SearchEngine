Although porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) was consistently associated with PMWS in early studies (Segal\u00e9s et al., 1997), only recently it has been experimentally demonstrated to be the etiological agent of PMWS (Harms et al., 2001, Bolin et al., 2001).",

            "text": "It has been suggested that PMWS may be related with immunosuppression in pigs (Segal\u00e9s et al., 2001). Typical microscopic lymphoid damage in PMWS affected tissues (Segales et al., 1997, Rosell et al., 1999), and the association of the disease with opportunistic pathogens commonly associated with immunosuppression (Clark, 1997, Carrasco et al., 2000), help to support this hypothesis. Furthermore, some studies demonstrated that the over stimulation of infected pig\u2019s immune system, or routine vaccination could potentiate PCV2 infection and subsequent development of wasting disease (Allan et al., 2000, Krakowka et al., 2001). Flow cytometry and immunohistochemical (IHC) studies have been performed to determine the changes on leukocyte populations of conventional pigs affected with PMWS (Shibahara et al., 2000, Segales et al., 2001, Darwich et al., 2002, Sarli et al., 2001). The most relevant findings reported in these studies were decrease of circulating B cells (Darwich et al., 2002) and loss of lymphocytes in B-cell areas (Shibahara et al., 2000). Moreover, a decrease in CD4+ and/or CD8+ T lymphocytes has also been described (Sarli et al., 2001, Segales et al., 2001, Darwich et al., 2002).",

Varying degrees of lymphocytic depletion and histiocytic infiltration were observed in all pigs studied; however, significant numbers of MGCs were only observed in stage II affected cases. Activation of the immune system is considered crucial for the formation of this cell type in tonsil and adenoid tissues of human immunodeficiency virus affected patients (Orenstein and Wahl, 1999). Our results suggest that a similar phenomenon with formation of MGCs only occur in more immunologically responsive PCV2 infected animals.

In our study heavy infiltrations of lysozyme-positive macrophages were observed in stages II and III, with a similar pattern of distribution to PCV2 infected cells. Recent studies on viral immune evasion mechanisms explain how DNA viruses are able to acquire immune response genes of the host, which blocks or subvert the host anti-virus immune and inflammatory responses (Alcami and Koszinowski, 2000, Haig, 2001). PCV2 may inhibit one of several host anti-virus responses, such as apoptosis, chemokine production, or interferon production allowing macrophages to survive longer.

BL2H5 antibody cytoplasm labelling the of these cells is not a surprising finding since MHC II is firstly assembled to the antigen in the endoplasmic reticulum before transportation to the cell surface (Calafat et al., 1994). BL2H5 antibody demonstrated that APCs and PCV2 infected cells have a very similar pattern of distribution, reinforcing the observation that all types of APCs could be PCV2 infection target cells (Rosell et al., 1999), not just macrophages as previously suggested (Kiupel et al., 1999). In stages I and II, APCs number, but not their distribution, was very similar to control cases, whereas in stage III a smaller number of these cells were observed. This finding can be explained by the replacement of B cells by infiltrating macrophages, since B-lymphocytes are also APCs. In our study, only the most severely affected pigs showed a decreased number of APCs; however, because these animals were killed it is impossible to predict what changes would have occurred if they had survived longer. It may well be that the most significant APCs loss occurs in the terminal stage of disease.",

PCV2 have been confirmed as the causal agent of these lesions (Kennedy et al., 2000) and the disease can be reproduced by this virus alone (Bolin et al., 2001, Harms et al., 2001). Further characterisations of lymphoid lesions of this study support the hypothesis that PMWS affected pig are immunosuppressed (Sarli et al., 2001, Segales et al., 2001, Darwich et al., 2002). Pathological stages I, II, and III defined in this work might be comparable to three distinct clinical stages of the disease (initial, intermediate and final), but some of these differences can be related to variation in immunological responses of individual pigs to PCV2 infection. Further experimental studies should be performed to better understand PMWS pathogenesis.",
