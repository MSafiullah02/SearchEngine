Trial recruitment that is slower than expected can result in prolonged trial durations, increased costs, uneven workload, and morale problems, both for trial participants and trialists. 1 Furthermore, when recruitment is so poor that it needs to be curtailed before the trial's target sample size is reached, study power is reduced and there may be a need to revise study endpoints. 2 The CONSORT statement on recruitment (Box 1) requires that the dates of recruitment commencement and closure be delineated. 3 These dates are influenced by a number of factors, described below.",

Studies should permit changes to best clinical care during the course of study follow-up. This will maintain both the ethical integrity of the study and investigator interest, and protect participants while retaining scientific efficiency. For example, in a study examining the effects of a fibrate to prevent vascular disease in diabetes, a new indication for statin treatment, based on existing trial evidence, may emerge for some participants during follow-up. In this instance, it would be preferable to allow those participants to use statins while continuing their study medication, rather than requiring them to withdraw from the study or stop taking study medication, potentially increasing the risk of participants being lost to follow-up because statin therapy is prohibited in the study protocol.",

For example, recruiting patients presenting with fever and acute respiratory symptoms into a study of treatments for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in which some may turn out to have negative tests for coronavirus, would result in a study with reduced efficiency (statistical power). 2 In this example, a brief run-in period or delayed randomisation may provide an opportunity for patients still uncertain about a commitment to participate, or those who don't actually have SARS, to be identified and not randomly allocated to a study group. The amount of data collected at registration and subsequently throughout the trial can have a negative impact on the enthusiasm of both participants and investigators. Onerous clinical tests and data requirements at registration to determine eligibility can deter participants from entering trials, while complicated or tedious protocols can dissuade clinical staff from identifying and recruiting subjects. Because of this, each proposed data item to be collected should be carefully justified for inclusion in the trial protocol.",

However, all centres need to have a patient pool of adequate size, and the infrastructure and resources to recruit and manage the projected number of patients efficiently. Centres interested in participating in the study should identify through their screening logs (or equivalents) their potential participant numbers. However, only a proportion of these would eventually be recruited into the study. Research clinics should ideally be geographically accessible to the targeted patient group, and reimbursement of patient's expenses, as well as their transport and parking arrangements, should be considered. Payments to participating clinics for study costs are usually on a pro-rata basis, with funds matched to the number of participants recruited at each location.",

Employing an experienced and dedicated research coordinator at each participating trial centre is a key to successful recruitment, and reduces the time demanded of investigators. In the Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) study, 11 experience during the recruitment phase suggested that staff became better at identifying patients who would be poor long-term compliers, and were able to exclude more of such patients in the later stages of recruitment.
