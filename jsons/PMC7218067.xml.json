The seven most commonly used interviews and self-report questionnaires together describe a heterogenous group of 52 symptoms, such as either high or low appetite, more or less sleep than usual, and a feeling of sadness (17). This causes differences in diagnosis based on which scale is used (18). The widely varying patterns in which these symptoms often present themselves (19, 20), and the high occurrence of several comorbidities, such as anxiety, psychosis, and autism spectrum disorder, indicate that depression is not a homogenous disease, but a continuous, heterogeneous group of disorders associated with a wide variety of different risk factors (4, 8, 21\u201324).",

Patients with melancholic depression, a subtype based on symptoms, were thought to respond better to TCAs than atypical patients (hence the name) (20, 27, 31, 32), but other researchers could not replicate this finding (33\u201336). Plasma levels of leptin, which reduces appetite, has been found higher in melancholic patients (37), or higher in atypical patients (38).

Also a disruption of the diurnal variation of cortisol is commonly seen (46, 47).

The stressor may be in the past (e.g. childhood maltreatment or trauma) (4, 50), or acutely (e.g. dealing with new life events). The initial response of people to stress is typically a coping mechanism aimed at exerting control over the stressor either by avoiding, reducing or predicting its occurrence. Examples of such efforts are the canceling of obligations or disengagement from social interaction (51). The HPA axis exerts a fundamental role regulating both internal as external stimuli, integrating the physiopathological and behavioral dimensions of stress. We postulate that depression is the result of a failure of coping mechanisms to control the stressors and a differential dysregulation in the stress system.",

Preclinical experiments already hinted at a relation between the effectiveness of coping behavior, the effort involved and feedback on the development of gastric ulcers. Although coping efforts were effective, ulcers still developed when coping took more effort and less feedback was offered (52, 53). Preclinical evidence indicated that chronic exposure to relatively mild stressors which rats can adapt to relatively easily (e.g. tilting the cage at a slight angle, emptying a water bottle in the cage, introducing new bedding material), ultimately resulted in the development of anhedonia (50). The chronic character of having to cope with mild stressful events over and over again, and the lack of control over stressors, was sufficient for depressive symptoms to develop (54). In a forced swimming test, rats who were dosed with psilocybin developed the coping technique of floating faster than other rats, indicating a window of behavioral flexibility (55). Ketamine displayed the opposite effect, with more mobility (56). We hypothesize that depressive behavior, specifically anhedonia and withdrawal, and the consequent loss of interest and enjoyment in usual activities, is an evolutionary mechanism to guard the organism against the exhaustion that may results from excessive or chronic coping behavior. As such, depressive behavior is both an expression of psychological pressure and a physiological precaution. This substantiates the entanglement of psychological and physiological factors in MDD.",

Similarly, depression could be the expression of a forced change in allocation of attention. Depressed patients are known to ruminate, or continually analyze their problems and relive their memories (24). Anhedonia can be interpreted as a way to secure mental resources, by reducing the interest in distractions (20, 57). Depression can be seen as an exaggerated social navigating coping mechanism, caused by an accumulation of stress and a spiral of unsuccessful adaptive behaviors which leads to exhaustion. By entering a depressive mode, the organism aims to guard itself from exhaustion. The challenge is to interfere with this mood-affecting spiralling mechanism (see Figure 1) to prevent depression from developing. Dealing with stress and potential exhaustion, as opposed to dealing with the symptoms of depression, could prove to be an effective treatment approach.",

Even defining depression subtypes based on symptoms has not helped (62). Despite guidelines and evidence-based interventions, treatment is still primarily based on trial and error (63, 64), and primarily aimed at improving mood. Yet, between one third (65) to half (20, 66) of adult patients show no response to weeks of first line treatment with antidepressant drugs, and are advised to try a different antidepressant. Further, one third of all patients never reach a response after four lines of antidepressant treatment (65). The current therapeutic shortcomings are the consequences of our lack of knowledge of causes, the underlying neurobiology and chemistry (67), and risk factors that contribute to the onset and maintenance of depression. As a consequence, the treatment paradigms are oversimplified with little attention for preventive measures (68).",

In the 1950s and 1960s, LSD and psilocybin were tested in several small-scale clinical trials for anxiety, depression and addiction (70, 71). In response to increased recreational use, international legislation was introduced as part of the \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d which brought an abrupt end to clinical research with these and similar substances in the 1970s (67, 69, 70, 72). In the last two decades, clinical trials with psychedelics have started to take place again (71). A brief overview of the indications these psychedelics have been investigated for post-2000 is indicated in Table 1 (69, 70, 72).",

            "text": "New insights in the complex etiology of depression might be offered by findings with the use of psychedelics for treatment-resistant depression (73, 74). Several psychedelics have shown to help depressive patients in a limited number of studies with small number of patients. The classic psychedelics, compounds such as LSD, psilocybin, and Ayahuasca, have diverse pharmacological profiles, including robust effects on the serotonergic system (67, 69, 72, 75). A psychedelic not acting on the serotonergic system is the dissociative anesthetic ketamine, which in subanesthetic doses acts as an antagonist on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a type of glutamate receptor (56, 69, 76, 77). Esketamine, the S-enantiomer of ketamine, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment-resistant depression (78), but ketamine has been and continues to be used off-label to treat depression too (79). This highlights that serotonergic activity, or even a mono-aminergic activity, is not required for the antidepressant effect of a psychedelic compound, further stressing the need for abandoning the old hypotheses. These hallucinogens, and the chemically related entactogen 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) may have a place in offering a positive experience to break the self-sustaining depressive state and allowing for introspection during psychotherapy to process stressful life-time experiences as a form of reverse medical engineering (80).",

Instead of the elevation of mood and the reduction of anxiety, psychedelic drugs induce a profound temporary positive experience (e.g. a mystical or religious sensation). This positive experience allows for the temporary disintegration of existing networks, which in turn facilitates reprocessing of past emotions and introspection (67). In turn, this improves the capacity to cope with stress (71). Also, the use of a psychedelic in combination with a psychotherapeutic process could have long-term effects, counteracting the effect of a negative experience and disrupting the negative and \u201cdownward spiralling\u201d compulsive thinking (72).",

The recent pandemic of the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCov (94)], has overwhelmed healthcare facilities with the high need for acute care.

Also, treatment practices that take into account preventive mental health interventions, and that focus on stress, exhaustion, and coping strategies, could have a significant and lasting impact on many patients struggling with depression. The perspective of stress, coping, and exhaustion provides the therapist with another treatment approach that can work in synergy with the existing arsenal of therapeutic approaches, making the therapist more effective.",

Our intuition is that during successful treatment patients experience small successes of effective coping and re-live the rewarding properties of such experiences. Reliving experiences could repair the damaged reward mechanisms and diminishes the experienced anxiety and stress which then might subsequently drive and sustain further recovery (97). Psychedelics may offer help in breaking free from the existing cognitive bias, by facilitating introspection, re-living of past experiences, and development of new coping mechanisms.",

Using a combination of treatment modalities could increase therapeutic effectiveness by improving the pace of learning new coping behaviors, exerting a synergistic impact on the developmental perspective, and breaking the downward spiral of stress and exhaustion, which eventually leads to a reduction of the depression symptoms. This might also help for other related mental disorders in adolescents and young adults where exhaustion and stress are central, such as burnout syndrome (98). But similarly, post-traumatic stress disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder are related to stress (24, 99\u2013101). These disorders could also benefit from the reframing of the concept of mood and stress. We would like to offer this integrated and multidisciplinary perspective as a consideration for the development of new multimodal treatment approaches for MDD and other related psychiatric disorders.",
