He had a 1-month history of phlegm in the throat, especially in the morning and at night, and tachypnoea. He occasionally regurgitated milk along with mucous sputum, and some medium and coarse moist rales could be heard in both lungs. Transient rhinorrhoea, paroxysmal cough, and diarrhoea without fever were apparent during the course of the disease. Laboratory examinations performed at admission revealed a normal white blood cell (WBC) count (7.93 \u00d7 10 9 /L) and C-reactive protein level (< 8 mg/L), with a mildly elevated platelet count (429 \u00d7 10 9 /L), and a high percentage lymphocytes (67%). Two days before admission, an X-ray radiograph showed slight interstitial changes in both lungs, and routine blood examination revealed elevated WBC (12.01 \u00d7 10 9 /L) and platelet (617 \u00d7 10 9 /L) counts. Cephalosporin antibiotics for treating the infection for more than 20 days had no obvious effect. A nasopharyngeal aspirate was collected from the child at admission, and the parents gave written informed consent for their child to participate in the study. We extracted RNA and DNA from the nasopharyngeal aspirate sample using aseptic techniques and tested the viral nucleic acids for evidence of respiratory viruses. Using molecular methods described previously, we tested for influenza virus (A, B and C), EV, metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, human bocavirus, parainfluenza virus (types 1-4), and coronaviruses (229E and OC43) [4, 6] . The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Children's Hospital of the Chongqing Medical University. The sample was positive for EV and parainfluenza virus type 3. IgG antibodies against cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus were also detected, while the sputum culture was negative for these viruses. To determine the enterovirus type, we amplified a portion of the 5'NCR-VP4/VP2 region of the enterovirus by nested PCR as described previously [4, 6] . The 330-bp amplicon was sequenced, and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis (http://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) revealed a high degree of similarity to EV-C117.",

MK089787), which was found to consist of 7364 nucleotides, excluding the poly(A) tail. The 5'UTR contains 672 nucleotides, and the 3'UTR consists of 70 nucleotides. The CQ6747 genome contains a single open reading frame from nt 673 to 7294 encoding a 2454-amino-acid polyprotein. The base composition of the full genome is 27.6% A, 23.7% C, 24.6% G, and 24.2% U. The complete genome sequence was compared with those of 22 HEV-C strains available in the Gen-Bank database, which included EV-104, EV-105, EV-109, EV-117, and EV-118. The CQ6747 isolate shares 73.8%-81.6% nucleotide sequence identity in the coding region with other HEV-C strains, including EV-104 (81.2%-81.6%), EV-105 (73.8%-74.0%), EV-109 (73.8%-73.9%), and EV-118 (74.0%-74.4%), and shares 96.7%-97.5% nucleotide sequence identity with other EV-C117 strains ( Table 2) . After alignment using MEGA version 7.0, we constructed a phylogenetic tree by the maximum-likelihood method, using the Tamura-Nei model and 1000 bootstrap replicates. The resulting tree showed that CQ6747 belongs to genotype EV-C117 (Fig. 1A) . Although it was genetically closer to the Lithuanian strain than to the USA strain, the CQ6747 strain was separate from both strains, with at least 75% bootstrap support.",

The VP1 sequence of the CQ6747 isolate is 96.5%-97.4% identical to those of other EV-C117 isolates, and other genome regions displayed >90% sequence identity to EV-C117. Conversely, all genome regions of CQ6747 showed less similarity to other EV-C strains (including EV-C104, EV-C105, EV-C109, and EV-C118) ( Table 2) . A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the VP1 gene nucleotide sequences using the maximum-likelihood method. This illustrated the differences among the CQ6747 strain isolated in this study, the Lithuanian strain, the Mongolian strains, and the USA strain (Fig. 1B) . In other phylogenetic trees that were constructed based on the 5'UTR, 3'UTR, VP2-VP4 region, 2A-2C region and 3A-3D region, more-pronounced genotype clustering was obtained, and the CQ6747 strain clustered with EV-C117 in all cases except for the 3'UTR tree (Supplemental Fig. 1 ).",
