ACE-2 expression may increase angiotensin II production, resulting in an increase in vasoconstriction and pulmonary vascular permeability (12) .

There are six WHO advocacies for parents and adolescents during confinement: 1) one-on-one time (including talking about sports, cooking, and physical activities), 2) staying positive in difficult times, 3) creating a daily routine, 4) avoiding bad behavior and habits, 5) keeping calm and managing stress, and 6) being honest and supportive when talking about COVID-19 (37). 2. Adolescents should be encouraged to practice social distancing to limit potential exposure and to wear masks to protect against SARS-CoV-2, particularly outside of the home and during outpatient visits. 3. Telemedicine seems to be an effective and sustainable technology for adolescents, parents, and multidisciplinary teams. This technology may help conduct online appointments with respect to adolescent physicians and pediatric subspecialties during the COVID-19 pandemic (38-40). 4. Adolescence is a transitional stage involving biological, psychological, and cultural expressions and cognitive development. During this period, teenagers gradually become more independent, gaining autonomy from parents, bonding with their peers, and beginning romantic interests (41, 42) . Feelings, fear of developing the coronavirus infection and dying, peer relations, closing of schools and universities, suspending sporting events, familial financial loss, domestic conflict, parents' tension, and novel daily hygiene habits should be discussed in the adolescent appointments. These appointments may be focused on only teenagers or may include adolescents and their parents (43, 44) . 5. A home schooling plan for adolescents should be applied by schools/universities and teachers using online tools (44). 6. Healthy foods should be reinforced during quarantine, avoiding ultra-processed foods, reinforcing cooking, and stocking homemade foods. 7. Physical exercise is essential during the lockdown. There are several specialized online channels with recreational activities and easy access via the internet for adolescents who stay at home. Outdoor activities should be avoided. 8. Quarantine has been a necessary preventive measure during this pandemic around the world and may result in negative psychological outcomes in adolescents and their families. Therefore, information and communication for adolescents (using telemedicine or telephone support lines) and motivation through social networking by mobile phone should be priorities (45) . Psychological and psychiatric issues (such as acute stress, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and emotional exhaustion) may occur or worsen in healthy adolescents and adolescents with chronic illnesses during the COVID-19 quarantine/lockdown and social isolation, requiring online mental health services (as cognitive behavioral therapy) (39, 40, 45) . 9. Home confinements may induce longer screen time and sleep issues. Regular sleep patterns and parental control of screen time should be reinforced during the lockdown. 10. Drinking alcohol does not protect against COVID-19 and alcohol intake can increase the risk of health issues in adolescents (37). 11. Since prisons are the epicenters for infectious diseases, the prevention and control of COVID-19 are required for specific adolescents and youth populations in jail, including individual protection measures, social distancing, regular environmental cleaning, and limiting prison visits (46, 47) .",

Adherence to medications should be reinforced for all adolescents with preexisting chronic disease (42). 15. Immunosuppressive and immune-modifying drug treatments, multiagent chemotherapy, and stem cell transplantation should be evaluated for each adolescent without COVID-19, according to their specific preexisting chronic disease. 16. Medications should be adjusted or stopped for each adolescent who has been infected with for SARS-CoV-2 or has been confirmed as having COVID-19 for each specific preexisting chronic condition. The immunosuppressive agents may be restarted after two weeks if the adolescent has not developed COVID-19 manifestations or after complete sign and symptom resolution, as suggested for inflammatory bowel disease patients (35) . 17. The comorbidities in adolescents that are associated with a high risk of severe COVID-19 in adult populations should be identified, stopped, and/or treated: smoking, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, asthma, and chronic kidney disease (2-4). 18. The vaccination card must be updated. During the COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents with preexisting chronic diseases should receive the annual influenza vaccine, regardless of current disease activity and the use of any immunosuppressive drug, as suggested for adolescents with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (48) . The adolescents in prison should also receive this annual immunization. 19. Adolescents with autoimmune diseases, who have confirmed COVID-19 must be strictly monitored for the possible risk of reactivation of the disease after the resolution of this viral infection (32). 20.
