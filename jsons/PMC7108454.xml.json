POCTs are rapid, easy-to-use tests carried out near the patient by non- laboratory-trained personnel. A benefit of POCTs is their use in helping physicians to manage patients\u2019 expectations for antibiotics and to encourage patients to self-care when suffering from a self-limiting condition (8). At the moment, general practitioners (GPs) in many countries only have access to POCTs for nonspecific biomarkers, such as CRP and cell count. Although these tests have been demonstrated to have an effect on antibiotic prescriptions, recent studies suggest that testing for both biomarkers and for viruses might further reduce these prescription rates (9,10).",

In cases where a respiratory virus was detected by the POCT, some patients reported being more confident about the self-limiting aspect of the illness. During the interviews, five out of 7 GPs considered the POCT helpful as they now had a tool to convince patients about the viral diagnosis. Five thought it would have influence on their antibiotic prescription behaviour, not only during regular opening hours, but also at the out-of-hours department. According to the GPs, referral to a hospital would not be influenced by this POCT as this is often based on clinical symptoms and not on etiological diagnosis. All GPs thought implementing this POCT in primary health care would increase patient satisfaction, which might contribute to patients\u2019 expectations and self-management, possibly influencing inappropriate referrals, a decrease in additional testing and extra visits. Disadvantages of the POCT are the extra costs and the time interval before final test results are reported, which requires a change in work flow.

This is likely due to the patients in our sample having a lower viral load than the patients in the other studies, a factor that\u2014as demonstrated here\u2014reduces the sensitivity of the POCT. Three main factors might have influenced the lower viral load in most of our samples and thus the lower sensitivity. Firstly, our study population consisted mainly of adults, while other studies of this POCT were mainly conducted in children. Children often have higher viral loads which can explain better results in antigen detection tests (20). Secondly, while the previous studies were done in patients who were hospitalized or presented at an outpatient department, here we evaluated the POCT in primary care where patients tend to have less severe illness than those in hospital. Some studies suggest that disease severity correlates positively with viral load (21). Thirdly, many patients in our study visited the GP almost a week after symptoms had started (data not shown). Antigen tests are designed to detect pathogens in the acute stage of the infection, during the first 3\u20134 days after symptom onset, since this is when viral load is highest (22).",

The research team continuously motivated GPs to refer patients for study participation, but some eligible patients might not have been recruited. However, compared to other primary care studies, the number of patients that we included was quite high, probably because of the fact that this study was performed in only one family practice and during just one respiratory season.",

The implementation of such POCTs could help in confirming the presence of a viral infection and positively influence the rate of antibiotic prescription by GPs, in the Netherlands, but possibly also in other countries. This is in agreement with the results of an international survey among GPs which indicated an unmet clinical need for a more widely accessible range of POCTs to assist clinicians\u2019 decisions, especially for acute conditions (24). A first explorative interview amongst the GPs revealed positive feedback on the usefulness of the POCT, but a more appropriate qualitative survey needs to increase insight in the potential additional value of POCTs in primary health care. Nevertheless, GPs should consider use of the POCT with care as the diagnostic performance of antigen tests depends on the viral load of the sample, which is in turn influenced by the severity of the illness and duration of symptoms. We have shown with the diagnostic test sensitivities estimated in our study that false-negative results are common. For clinical decision making, the test result should therefore always be interpreted in the light of the patient\u2019s medical history and physical exam.",

Besides, it is important to note that multifaceted interventions to reduce overuse of antibiotics are more effective than single initiatives (25).
