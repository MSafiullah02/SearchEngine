            "text": "As a major concern in the research community, drug resistance against single pathway inhibition has posed a considerable obstacle to cancer treatment (Ma et al. 2018). Particularly, a plethora of clinically investigated kinase inhibitors (KIs) suffer from insufficient therapeutic response attributed to the redundancy in cancer-related survival pathways, thereby hindering their further progress. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR (PAM) pathway inhibitors fit into the scenario, where monotherapy upregulates compensatory cellular signaling (Heavey et al. 2016). Ras/MEK/ERK cascade, another pivotal intracellular survival signaling (Chappell et al. 2011; Tsai and Nussinov 2013), is involved in molecular reciprocity with PAM pathway. The cross talk and feedback loop between them exist due to interaction at various signaling nodes, exemplified by mTOR (Holt et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2011; Chow et al. 2017; Eser et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2012). Besides, the concurrent deregulation of both pathways contributes to the etiology of a variety of malignancies (Garcia-Garcia et al. 2015). To conquer the bypass mechanism and achieve synergism, drug cocktails simultaneously modulating PAM and Ras/MEK/ERK pathways have been investigated throughout recent years (Cante-Barrett et al. 2016; Pitts et al. 2014; Mohan et al. 2015; Park et al. 2015). However, owing to the limitations of drug cocktails, including the combined off-target effects, complicated pharmacokinetics and therapeutic regimen, as well as potential drug-drug interactions, the exploration of polypharmacological agents ablating multiple disease-related pathways has been given increasing importance (Ma et al. 2018).",

For instance, combination of AZD-8055 (ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor) and selumetinib (MEK inhibitor) culminated in the reciprocal pathway inhibition and increased apoptosis in tumor tissue from mouse xenograft models of non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal carcinoma (Holt et al. 2012). In addition, the synergism between them was also observed in treating rhabdomyosarcoma (Renshaw et al. 2013). Nonetheless, to our knowledge, no mTOR/MEK bifunctional inhibitors have been disclosed so far. Bifunctional inhibitors of this kind and the recently reported PI3K/MEK dual inhibitors (Van Dort et al. 2017) have the potential to provide novel remedies for cancer treatment.",

            "text": "During our previous work in search for mTOR KI, a promising quinoline derivative MXD-42 (1, Fig. 1) was identified with remarkable inhibitory activity against mTOR, as well as potent antiproliferative activity against tumor cell lines (Ma et al. 2015). According to the molecular docking analysis, its piperazine moiety oriented toward the solvent-exposed region. This was consistent with the structure\u2013activity relationships (SARs) of these quinoline derivatives, which illustrated appropriate derivatization at the piperazine did not dramatically alter the enzymatic activity. In view of these, the piperazine of 1 may serve as a synthetic handle for attaining conjugated mTOR/MEK bifunctional inhibitors via being attached to MEK inhibitor through a chemical linkage. The binding mode of RO-5126766 (2, Fig. 2), an allosteric MEK inhibitor under clinical evaluation (phase I, https://clinicaltrials.gov/), with MEK1 demonstrated its pyridine moiety extended out towards the solvent-exposed region with the terminal nitrogen of the sulphonylurea conferring a vector for structural derivatization (Lito et al. 2014). Furthermore, SARs study of 2 showed replacement of the pyrimidin-2-yloxy group with a dimethylaminocarbamate moiety enhanced MEK affinity (Iikura et al. 2011; Van Dort et al. 2015). Although replacing the 3-fluoropyridine-2-aminosulfonamide group with a simpler 3-(sulfonamido)phenyl moiety slightly lowered the activity, it simplified the covalent linking to the mTOR-binding fragment (Fig. 2). Based on the considerations stated above, we have recently conducted a proof-of-principle study to validate the feasibility of achieving mTOR/MEK dual inhibition via covalently linking mTOR KI to an allosteric MEK inhibitor. Herein, we communicate our discovery of a conjugated mTOR/MEK1 dual-targeted inhibitor from 1 and 2 (Fig. 3).",

Meanwhile, the linker tethered to the piperazine moiety, as well as the MEK-binding fragment, was located in a solvent-exposed region. When docked into the allosteric pocket of MEK1 (Fig. 4b), the MEK-binding fragment of 13 conferred H-bond interactions with residues Val211, Ser212, and Asp208. Similarly, the linker and the mTOR-binding fragment extended out of the catalytic cleft. The capability of 13 to form H-bonds with critical residues in the mTOR and MEK1 catalytic clefts may account for its dual inhibitory activity.",

            "text": "The reciprocal pathway inhibition, along with the enhanced antitumor efficacy, resulted from mTOR inhibitor/MEK inhibitor drug cocktail has provided a fundamental basis for the exploration of polypharmacological agents targeting both mTOR and MEK. Besides the potential to evade the bypass mechanism underlying the resistance to singe pathway inhibition, the bifunctional inhibitors of mTOR and MEK are capable of surmounting the drawbacks of drug cocktails. From this proof-of-principle study, it became evident that the single-agent dual inhibition of mTOR and MEK can be accomplished via covalently attaching mTOR KI to an allosteric MEK inhibitor. Compound 13, emerging from this strategy, exerted moderately high inhibitory activity against mTOR and MEK1 with IC50 values of 0.19 \u03bcM and 0.98 \u03bcM, respectively. Particularly, it exhibited comparable antiproliferative activity to both parent compounds against A549 and HCT116 cell lines. To our knowledge, 13 has been the first conjugated mTOR/MEK bifunctional inhibitor reported up to date. However, this prototype dual-targeted inhibitor demands further optimization of the enzyme affinity and the drug-like property. Hence, in the future SAR investigation, MEK-binding fragments generated from more potent allosteric MEK inhibitors will be incorporated, and the chemical diversity of the covalent linkers will be broadened.",

The kinase reaction mixture in each well was composed of 2.5 \u03bcL of compound solution, 2.5 \u03bcL of kinase solution, and 5 \u03bcL of substrate solution. After being incubated at room temperature for 0.5 h, 10 \u03bcL of kinase detection buffer containing EDTA and Eu-anti-phospho-4E-BP1 antibody (Thr37/46, PE) was added to each well of the assay plate. Before reading on Envision, the mixture need be mixed briefly with centrifuge and was allowed to equilibrate for 1 h. After calculating the percent inhibition from lance signal, the curves were fitted with four-parameter logistic model in XLFit to give IC50 values.",

For preparing the ligands, 3D structures were generated and their energy minimization performed. For preparing the receptors, the hydrogen atoms were added and the CHARMm-force field employed. The site sphere was determined based on the binding location of Torin 2 in mTOR or RO-5126766 in MEK1. Torin 2 was removed, and compound 13 was docked into the defined site in mTOR. Similarly, RO-5126766 was removed, and compound 13 was docked into the defined site in MEK1. After analyzing the types of interactions between 13 and mTOR or MEK1, the final binding conformation in mTOR or MEK was determined according to the calculated energy.",
