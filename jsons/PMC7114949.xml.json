            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first discovered in 2009 in Hong Kong from swine fecal samples (Woo et al., 2012). PDCoV was recognized as the causative agent of acute diarrhoea and vomiting in pigs (Hu et al., 2015; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014). Since its appearance, PDCoV has caused significant economic losses for the swine industry worldwide. PDCoV is a member of the genus Deltacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae and is an enveloped virus that has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) genome of 25.4 kb in length (Lee and Lee, 2015; Phan et al., 2018). The PDCoV genome has seven major open reading frames (ORFs). Two overlapping ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b) encode two replication-associated proteins, which are both autoproteolytically cleaved into 15 nonstructural proteins (Nsp2 to Nsp16) (Wang et al., 2018a; Woo et al., 2010). The remaining ORF encodes the spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N). Additionally, three accessory proteins were identified: nonstructural protein 6 (NS6), NS7, and NS7a (Fang et al., 2017, 2016; Luo et al., 2016).",

The S protein plays a pivotal role in the viral entry and stimulates the induction of neutralizing antibodies in the natural host (Chen et al., 2019c; Chiou et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). N protein is a conservative target for virological detection by PCR (Lee and Lee, 2015). N protein also plays an important role in viral pathogenesis (Chen et al., 2019b; Likai et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2015, 2014). PEDV N protein can antagonize beta interferon and interferon-\u03bb production (Ding et al., 2014; Shan et al., 2018). SARS-CoV N protein can bind to DNA in vitro (Chen et al., 2007). hCoV-OC43 N protein interacts with the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) (de Haan and Rottier, 2005). The ORF1a region is the most variable region of the PDCoV genome and substitutions, deletions and insertions have been observed in the Nsp2 and Nsp3 coding region in Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos (Lorsirigool et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2015).",

All the sequences were aligned using the MEGA5 program, and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbour-joining method. The reliability of the branching orders was evaluated by the bootstrap test (n = 1,000). After nucleotide homology comparison and screening, 29 representative strains were selected from 102 strains for molecular evolutionary analyses (Tables 2\nand S1). In addition, these strain sequences have been previously published as reference sequences (Suzuki et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019a, c; Zhang et al., 2019d).",

Compared to other structural proteins, N protein is the most conserved structural proteins and remains the primary target protein for current diagnostic tests (McBride et al., 2014). Recently, a recombinant N protein-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (rPDCoV-N-ELISA) was established to detect PDCoV IgG antibodies (Su et al., 2016). Similar ELISA test has been done in Taiwan (Hsu et al., 2018). Compared with the reference strain HKU15-44, the following aa changes were detected in CHN-AH-2004, SD, P1_BTL_0115/2016/Lao and Thailand/S5015 L/2015 at 43 V/A, 163S/P, and 265I/M, respectively.

N protein is a multifunctional protein, the key conserved amino acid site mutations affect their function, for example, the Arg-76 and Tyr-94 residues in the IBV N protein are critical for RNA binding, SARS-CoV N protein also exists Arg-94 and Tyr-122 residues (Tan et al., 2006). PDCOV is difficult to isolate and there are few reverse genetic studies. So far, there have been no related reports that mutations in key amino acids of the N protein will affect the current diagnostic tests.",

Outbreaks of these enteric coronaviruses have been reported in China, causing substantial economic losses in the swine industry (Qing et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2019). In 2014, PDCoV was first detected in China, causing tremendous financial losses in the swine industry, and the virus has rapidly spread nationwide (Dong et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2018; Mai et al., 2018a; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018b). Thus, the molecular characterization of these PDCoVs is a major focus of Chinese virological research.",

The Vietnam/Laos/Thailand lineage strains had 6-nt (AGTTTG) and 9-nt (GAGCCAGTC) deletions in ORF1a (Le et al., 2018). In 2015, only a few strains with similar deletions have been reported in China, such as the CH/Sichuan/S27/2012 strain with the 6-nt and 9-nt deletions in the ORF1a (Wang et al., 2015). The ORF1a deletion region encoded Nsp2 and Nsp3 proteins. The Nsp3 protein acts as a scaffold protein to interact with itself and bind other viral Nsps or host proteins (Nogales et al., 2012; Yuan et al., 2015). Nsp3 protein contains one or two papain-like protease (PLpro) domain(s) with deubiquitinating (DUB) and deISGylating activities in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Alfuwaires et al., 2017; Neuman, 2016). In MHV, the Nsp3 protein ubiquitin-like domains could interfere with pathways involving ubiquitinylated or ISGylated host targets, thereby leading to the disruption of host anti-viral signal transduction or protein degradation (Chen and Makino, 2004). Nsp3 protein was also recommended as a marker for monitoring coronavirus evolution and for surveying the molecular epidemiology in lineage C betaCoVs (Forni et al., 2016). Additionally, the MERS-CoV Nsp3 Arg911Cys mutation is an example of adaptive evolution(Shokri et al., 2019). In TGEV Nsps 2, 3, and 8 were incorporated into the CoV virions, involving in CoV replication (Nogales et al., 2012).",

The USA/Japan/South Korea lineage strains were characterized by no discontinuous deletions in the Nsp2 and Nsp3 coding regions, while the Vietnam/Laos/Thailand lineage strains showed a discontinuous 5-aa deletion (2aa+3aa) at 400\u2013401 and 758\u2013760 in the Nsp2 and Nsp3 coding regions. These regional deletions were also observed in a Chinese CH/Sichuan/S27/2012 strain. Here, we found 5 novel strains with the same deletion pattern of \u201c2 + 3aa\u201d in the Nsp2 and Nsp3 coding regions. Interestingly, the SD12-2018 and CHN-HG-2017 strains have a continuous \u201c0 + 3aa\u201d in the Nsp3 deletion at 758\u2013760. Additionally, SD07-2018, SD09-2018, SD10-2018 and SD11-2018 strains have a continuous \u201c0 + 7aa\u201d deletion at 755\u2013761 in Nsp3. Two continuous aa deletion in Nsp2 was also identified in a Chinese strain, SD, which has two\u201c2 + 0aa\u201d deletions at position 400\u2013401. Remarkably, natural deletions and insertions occurred in the ORF1a sequence, and these have led to genome size differences among PDCoV strains. However, the role of double deletions in the ORF1 of this virus remains unclear. Thus, the current results indicate that the novel deletion of Nsp2 and Nsp3 may provide another approach to the diagnosis.",

Therefore, the S protein has been the primary target for the development of vaccines against PDCoV and for determining genetic relatedness among PDCoV isolates. In this study, compared with the USA/Japan/South Korea lineage and Vietnam/Laos/Thailand lineage strains, the 10 strains showed one amino acid (52 N) deletion in the S protein. A comparison of the antigenic index profiles of the S protein among the IL/2014/026PDV_P11, CHN-HG-2017, and Vietnam/Binh21/2015 lineage strains and SD-06-2018 indicated that in SD-06-2018 the deletion region appears to have a higher degree of antigenic change than that of other strains, indicating it may be involved in PDCoV immune escape. S1 NTD has higher sequence variability (Fig. 5\n).",

The coronavirus N protein is a multifunctional protein involved in virus assembly, translation, apoptosis induction and host innate immune defence. SARS-CoV N protein not only modulates the host cell cycle by regulating cyclin-CDK activity but also inhibits the synthesis of type-1 interferon (1 F N) (Chang et al., 2014; Liao et al., 2005). PDCoV N protein suppressed Sendai virus (SEV)-induced IFN-\u03b2 production and transcription factor IRF3 activation (Chen et al., 2019a). Furthermore, the N-terminal region (1\u2013246 aa) interacts with pRIG-I and interferes with its function (Chen et al., 2019a). The N protein analysed showed few differences among the three lineage strains. They shared 97.3 %\u201399.3 % sequence identity with the three lineage strains.",
