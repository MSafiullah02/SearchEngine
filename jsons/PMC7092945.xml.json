Briefly, SARS coronavirus RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed (RT) into cDNA. Then N, M, Sa, and Sb genes were amplified with PCR methods. PCR products were inserted into BamHI and EcoRI clone sites of pcDNA3.1 vector. Recombinant plasmids were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing analysis.

The proteins were purified by sonication and repeated washing, and then dissolved in Tris/HCl buffer with 8 M urea and further purified using Ni\u2013NTA agarose (Invitrogen). Finally, the denatured proteins were refolded by dialysis in Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4). The purities of recombinant N, M, Sa, and Sb proteins were confirmed by Western blot experiments. The wells were rinsed with PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 and then blocked with 10% FBS in PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C.

After extensive washings, antibodies were detected by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 2 h. After the substrate was added, the reaction was stopped with 2.0 M H2SO4, and the absorbance was measured at wavelengths of 450 nm with 600 nm for a reference value. The antibody titers were relatively expressed as the value of OD450 nm.",

Zhang et al. [11] analyzed that SARS-CoV S protein has the potential for inducing neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV. Yang et al. [12] showed that the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein can mediate viral entry through pH-dependent endocytosis. Hsu et al. [13] showed that the SARS-CoV spike protein is a primary target for vaccine and drug development. Bisht et al. [14] constructed recombinant forms of the highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) containing the gene encoding full-length SARS-CoV S produced serum antibodies that neutralized SARS-CoV in vitro. He et al. [15] show that a recombinant fusion protein containing fragments of SARS S protein and a human IgG1 Fc fragment can induce highly potent antibody responses in the immunized rabbits. Buchholz et al. [16] investigated the contributions of the S proteins of SARS-CoV to protective immunity by expressing into a recombinant parainfluenza virus type 3 vector (BHPIV3). The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of BHPIV3/SARS expressing S protein induced a high titer of antibodies than other proteins [16]. In our experiments, pcDNASa\u2013pcDNASb can induce the strongest humoral immune response in week 12. These results show that SARS-CoV S protein is one of the important proteins to induce humoral immune response.",

Viral replication was reduced by more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with the DNA vaccine. SARS-CoV DNA vaccine elicits effective immune responses in an animal model. Zeng et al. [28] analyzed the immunological characteristics of SARS-CoV S protein by administering mice with plasmids encoding various S gene fragments. Results showed that the DNA vaccines were capable of eliciting SARS-CoV-specific antibodies. These finding provide insights into understanding the immunological characteristics of spike protein in DNA vaccine developments. A combination delivery of SARS-Cov S, M, and N genes into macaques using adenoviral vector elicited high titer of neutralizing antibodies [31]. These important results show that different gene fragments of SARS DNA vaccine have different immune response characteristics.
