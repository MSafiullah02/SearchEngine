By comparison, zinc gluconate is a weak organic salt that dissolves to form positively charged zinc ions and negatively charged gluconate\u2014a naturally occurring, nontoxic compound found in all human tissues.",

Pharmacists should reassure patients of zinc's safety when used at dosages consistent with product labeling. Adverse effects are mild and are generally confined to the gastrointestinal tract. Patients should be counseled to begin zinc at the very first sign of cold symptoms, ideally within 24 hours of onset of cold symptoms. Zinc products should be continued until symptoms resolve or until otherwise advised by a physician.
