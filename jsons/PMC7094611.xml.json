The aetiological agent of this syndrome was a newly emerged and previously unrecognized coronavirus, now known as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Kuiken et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003). SARS is an acute pulmonary syndrome characterized by atypical pneumonia, progressive respiratory failure and death in up to 10% of infected individuals (Poon et al., 2004). Although the SARS epidemic has subsided, many authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have warned of the possible re-emergence of this highly infectious disease. It is therefore imperative that effective measures to prevent and treat the disease are developed and evaluated. To achieve this goal, animal models will play an essential role in studying the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection and in developing effective vaccines and therapeutics.",

Adult mice infected with SARS-CoV via the respiratory tract show no clinical signs of disease and only mild respiratory tract inflammation (Subbarao et al., 2004). Aged mice, hamsters and ferrets do show signs of clinical disease such as weight loss and ruffled fur but do not develop lung pathology (Martina et al., 2003, Roberts et al., 2005a, Roberts et al., 2005b). Two groups of investigators have studied SARS-CoV infection in African green monkeys and common marmosets (Kuiken et al., 2003, McAuliffe et al., 2004, Greenough et al., 2005). Others have evaluated cynomolgus monkeys and rhesus macaques as potential models, but clinical disease is inconsistently induced in these latter species (Kuiken et al., 2003, McAuliffe et al., 2004, Rowe et al., 2004).",

No clinical signs or tissue histopathological changes were observed in any of these animals post-infection. By contrast, all cynomolgus monkeys and rhesus macaques inoculated in this manner developed interstitial pneumonia of variable severity but no other tissue changes (Liu et al., 2004). This pulmonary pathology was similar in nature to that seen in SARS patients, but the lesions were less severe than in infected humans. Therefore, there remains a requirement for an animal model of human SARS that closer approximates the tissue pathology that occurs in the human disease.",

This report prompted us to examine the feasibility of using civets as a better animal model for SARS. In a preliminary infection study, two groups of civets were inoculated with two different strains of SARS-CoV. Strain GZ01 was isolated during the early stages of the SARS epidemic and strain BJ01 was isolated during the middle phase of the epidemic (Wu et al., 2005). Both strains were shown capable of infecting civets and inducing clinical signs including pyrexia, lethargy and loss of aggression (Wu et al., 2005). The aim of the present study was to extend these observations by characterizing the tissue pathology in the infected civets and determining the distribution of viral RNA in tissues from those animals. In addition, analysis of cellular apoptosis in selected tissues was also conducted in an attempt to understand the pathogenesis of this viral infection in civets and to further determine the suitability of this species to model the human disease.",

Ten one-year-old masked palm civets were housed in individual biosafety isolators and were divided into two groups (n\n = 5 per group). Animals in groups A and B were inoculated with 3 ml of virus solution containing 3 \u00d7 106 TCID50 of BJ01 and GZ01 isolates, respectively, with 2 ml instilled into the trachea and 1 ml given intranasally. A control civet was mock-infected in an identical fashion with 3 ml of Vero E6 cell culture supernatant. All work with infectious virus was performed inside a biosafety cabinet, in an approved animal biosafety level 3 laboratory. Serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis were conducted to confirm that the civets had not been previously exposed to SARS-CoV. Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the animal ethics guidelines and approved protocols issued by the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.",

It has been proposed that animal-to-human interspecies transmission is the most probable explanation for emergence of the SARS-CoV. Recent epidemiological investigations by two independent groups suggest that bats may be a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV. Bats are among the live animals sold in markets in southern China, providing a possible explanation for the occurrence of infection among civets and other animals in these markets (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005a).",

In one study it was shown that SARS-CoV genome sequences from civets underwent rapid evolution before transmission to humans, suggesting that civets were a relatively new host to those viruses, rather than a natural reservoir host that had adapted to SARS-CoV (Song et al., 2005). In another study it was shown that while approximately 80% of civets in one market in Guangzhou had serological evidence of infection by SARS-CoV, animals on farms were largely free from infection. This suggested that infection of civets was associated with trading activities under conditions of overcrowding and mixing of various animal species, which provided an environment for efficient interspecies transmission (Tu et al., 2004). Furthermore, it has been shown that the S proteins of SARS-CoV isolated from human patients in the early stage of the outbreaks bound to and utilized the civet ACE2 receptor molecule, but S proteins of the civet isolates used human ACE2 markedly less efficiently (Li et al., 2005b). These findings provide evidence that civets have served as an efficient amplification host for SARS-CoV and that the SARS-CoV has undergone rapid evolution after transmission to the human population.",

This distribution is again similar to that observed in human SARS patients (Ding et al., 2004, To et al., 2004, Nicholls et al., 2006). There is currently little information available regarding the distribution of SARS-CoV RNA in other experimental animals with the exception of detection of viral RNA in bronchiolar epithelial cells of mice at 2 dpi (Subbarao et al., 2004). In-situ apoptosis analysis revealed that for two civets, glial cells and neurons in the cerebrum displayed apoptosis at 3 and 13 dpi, respectively. This finding suggests that SARS-CoV may cause direct damage to those cells, providing useful information for future study of disease pathogenesis. The same set of probes and methods were applied to SARS-CoV infected monkey tissues obtained from previous studies, but no positive results were obtained, suggesting that civets and monkeys respond differently to SARS-CoV infection.",
