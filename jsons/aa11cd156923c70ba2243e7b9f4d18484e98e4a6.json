The different ways the pandemic has its footprint on our lives is a question that will probably be studied for years to come.

They found that the number of useful shared links is about the same as the misleading links. They identify a list of 'top' 5 common 'myths': Origin of COVID-19, flu comparison, home remedies, heat kills disease, and vaccine development from the search phrase \"Coronavirus common myths\". By matching the phrases and words in tweets with the broad descriptions of myths from Google search, they discover over 16,000 tweets containing these myths, which was a small fraction of Twitter content. Authors also identify the top 10 most frequent words in their dataset, including words such as China, people, cases, Wuhan, and Coronavirus. They also identify the top 8 most prevalent themes in their data as healthcare/illness, global nature, information providers, government response, individual concerns/strategies, emotion, and social through grouping frequent words in Twitter conversations.

(2020) raises the concern that discrimination towards ethnic minority groups like colored people and immigrants could lead to a higher risk of infection for these groups due to their limited access to medical resources and the lack of social protection. The rise of fake news has also worsened the problem of discrimination. A number of works have focused on related phenomena. For example, Schild et al. (2020) identify an increase in Sinophobic behaviour on the web and that its spread is a cross-platform phenomenon. Similarly, Shimizu (2020) find that xenophobia towards Chinese people spread in Japan due to a piece of misinformation stating that \"Chinese passengers from Wuhan with fever slipped through the quarantine at Kansai International Airport\" and the hashtag #ChineseDon'tComeToJapan trending in Twitter. Despite WHO officially naming coronavirus as COVID-19, use of controversial terms such as Chinese Virus, Wuham Virus. Lyu et al. (2020) reports work to predict twitter users who are more likely to use controversial terms related to the COVID-19 crisis.",

(2020) collected and analyzed the Real World Worry Dataset, a dataset comprising 2, 500 participants' indications of worry level and emotion type, and their written long and short texts about their emotional states. Unlike other works, this dataset is not from Twitter but rather is collected via the crowd-sourcing platform Pro-lific. Participants express their level of worry and emotion (anger, anxiety, desire, disgust, fear, happiness, relaxation, and sadness) in written form (short and long) that is matched with a 9-point scale. Using use a lexicon (LWIC2015), authors find significantly high correlations of worrying thoughts in long texts with the categories \"family\" and \"friends\". Topic models revealed the prevalent topics for short texts are related to government 'slogans' and suggesting social distancing for others, whereas common topics for long texts are lockdown and worries about employment and the economy. Authors also point out that participants tended to use short texts (tweet-sized) to call for solidarity and long texts to show their actual worries about family and friends.",
