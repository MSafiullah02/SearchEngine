These viruses include the human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and the human bocavirus (hBoV) first described in 2001 and 2005,1, 2 as well as the human coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1,3, 4 respectively. Most epidemiological and clinical studies have focused on children, where hMPV is associated for up to 25% of viral respiratory tract infections.2, 5 Unlike hBoV, the relationship between hMPV and symptomatic respiratory tract infection is undoubted. Since the first description of hBoV an increasing number of prevalence studies were published but until now disease association in children with acute respiratory tract infections remain unclear. So far it was controversially discussed whether human bocavirus is indeed a pathogen rather than an innocent bystander as it is frequently associated with coinfections and Koch's modified postulates cannot been fulfilled.6 Data for adults especially in immunocompromised patient are limited for both viruses.7, 8\n",

            "text": "In our high risk immunocompromised patients who underwent diagnostic procedure including BAL because of atypical pneumonia 20% had a diagnosis of PCP most of these patients were HIV-infected (group 1). However, in more than 60% of the examined patients no pathogen was detected and several other pathogens were found in only 20%. Newly described respiratory viruses were only detected in two patients consistent to previously published studies. Englund et al. evaluated retrospectively BAL specimens of adult patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for the presence hMPV and detected in five of 163 (3%).7 Of these five patients, four died of respiratory complications like our patient at a median of 16 days. In contrast none of the eight adult patients with pneumonia, sole detection of hMPV and several underlying diseases died in a recently published study by Johnestone et al. but immunocompromised patients were excluded from the analysis.14 Immunocompromised patients seem to be apparently more severely affected than non-immunocompromised patients like it is observed for several other viruses. Barenfanger et al. tested 161 patients older that 20 years and 230 patients younger than 20 years and detected hMPV in 3.1% vs 2.6%. Notable was also that only one of the children but all of the adults were hospitalized.15 Kamboj and coworkers most recently found that HMPV-infections in cancer patients caused a number of unspecific respiratory symptoms but observed no fatal cases of respiratory HMPV-infections16 in their cohort. Thus, the cases described here and by Englund et al. may have suffered from additional predisposing conditions that have not been identified so far. However, two further studies described that infection by HMPV was 5.8\u20139% in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, thus there my be indeed more severe but so far neglected cases in such cohorts.17, 18\n",

In an unpublished prospective matched-pair analysis our working group have shown that in hospitalized children hBoV-infection appears to be as serious as RSV-infection and these data demonstrated that human bocavirus is an independent and severe pathogen (Schildgen et al., submitted). For adult patients the importance of hBoV as a respiratory pathogen is unclear. Recently, Longtin et al. detected hBoV in only one of 126 (0.8%) symptomatic adults with bronchitis or pneumonia.8 However, we have recently described a clinical case of a severe pneumonia most likely associated to hBoV in an adult patient that was also confirmed by radiological findings.32 hBoV in immunocompromised pediatric patients were described after organ transplantation and in HIV-infected children.33, 34 Occurrence of hBoV in adult immunocompromised patients as described in the presented study seems to be rare but prospective studies are lacking.",
