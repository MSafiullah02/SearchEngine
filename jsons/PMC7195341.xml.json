This study is important and interesting; however, there are still some concerns about it.",

However, whether these included patients had took some medication before admission was still completely unclear in this study. It is noteworthy that mild liver test derangement would also be present at baseline in confirmed cases of COVID-19 who had received some medication use such as antipyretics (acetaminophen), antibiotics (macrolides, quinolones) or steroids before admitting to hospital.2\n",

Additionally, it has been found that remdesivir treatment during COVID-19 can also induce liver impairment. In a paper describing the first 12 patients with COVID-19 in the United States (U.S.), the three hospitalized patients, who received remdesivir at the time of clinical worsening, reported elevated liver enzymes.4 However, this issue has not been mentioned in the current study, and the authors should give some interpretation and explanation of these data in the text.",

Furthermore, the exact cause of pre-existing liver conditions has not yet been outlined in this study.",

Severe cases were more likely to have hepatitis B infection (2.4% vs 0.6%) than non-severe cases.6 SARS patients with HBV/HCV infection were more prone to develop severe hepatitis, probably due to enhanced viral replication during SARS-CoV infection to liver injury in patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill.7 These data suggest more intensive immunotherapy may be required to minimize COVID-19, an issue that warrants further study. However, in patients with COVID-19 with autoimmune hepatitis, the effects of administration of glucocorticoids on disease prognosis is unclear. Given the expression of the ACE2 receptor in cholangiocytes, whether infection with SARS-CoV-2 aggravates cholestasis in patients with primary biliary cholangitis, also needs to be studied in this study.",
