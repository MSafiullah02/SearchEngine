Successive sets of diagnostic criteria, essentially requiring objective evidence of at least two distinct lesions of CNS white matter (the last set almost 20 years old), allude not only to the absence of a pathognomonic test for MS, but also to the lack of adequate evidence for the reliability of the various criteria. Of note is the requirement for lack of an alternative diagnosis [2] , a criterion that imposes an element of \"diagnosis by exclusion.\" The white matter is progressively destroyed, leaving some of the victims incapacitated for life. For many years, the leading, and practically dogmatic, hypothesis has been that MS is an autoimmune condition and hence, that its symptoms and progression could be ameliorated by immunomodulating strategies. However, while the field of neuroimmunology has thrived, little progress has been made towards understanding MS. The current diagnostic criteria accommodate a wide range of conditions. Indeed, the extremely variable course and prognosis of the disease suggest that what is considered today a homogenous and consistent entity of similar etiology and pathogenesis, is, in fact, a syndrome caused by various etiologies and multiple pathogenic mechanisms [1\u2022] .",

The myelin loss, with neurons and axons being relatively spared, which is characteristic of the MS lesion, is associated with mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates within active plaques and in perivascular spaces. Macrophages and T lymphocytes are present in the center of a new lesion, which also shows reduction in the number of oligodendrocytes, reactive astrocytes, and microglial cells. Obviously, these findings may accompany an active ongoing infectious process. The predilection of the inflammation for the white matter is a Multiple sclerosis (MS) currently defies clinical and scientific definitions, and carries a prognosis that remains practically unchanged despite many years of intensive research. Although the prevailing dogma is that MS is an immune-mediated condition, it fulfills none of the criteria of an autoimmune disease. On the other hand, there is enough significant data to suggest that infectious agents(s) could be involved in either direct damage to the white matter or induce inflammatory responses that secondarily affect the brain.

They belong to the ever-growing group of cytokines that are capable of modulating the immune system. Nevertheless, one of their major functions is to combat viral infections.

The organism has also been implicated in a wide variety of disorders ranging from asthma, atherosclerotic vascular disease, and arthritis to Guillain-Barre syndrome and encephalitis. The possible relation of Chlamydia to MS was recently resurrected by a case report of a 24-year-old man who presented with a fulminant MSlike disease [43] . His condition deteriorated despite corticosteroid and \u03b2-interferon therapy. Although treated with cyclophosphamide, CSF cultures and PCR analysis turned out to be positive for Chlamydia pneumoniae, and prolonged antibiotic therapy was associated with neurologic recovery. This report was followed by analysis of 37 additional patients from the same center [44\u2022\u2022] , showing 64% of CSF samples culture-positive, and 97% PCR-positive for the organism, (compared with 11% and 18% in control patients, respectively), and 86% with CSF anti-Chlamydia antibodies. These findings were supported by one group [45] , but not by others [46] . Although the discrepancies may be due to lack of uniform standards and technical difficulties, it seems remarkable that a bacterium with distinct morphologic features could have eluded generations of neuropathologists. Furthermore, recent studies failed to detect Chlamydia DNA within brain lesions obtained by biopsy or autopsy of MS patients [47] . Thus, although in some geographical areas some MS patients may have a chronic CNS chlamydial infection, its cause and effect role in MS is questionable, because the pathogen is known to infect macrophages and could secondarily gain entrance into the CNS during MS exacerbations [44\u2022\u2022] .",

Thus, injury might be due to a concerted effect of cytokine-and antibody-mediated injury, direct injury to oligodendrocytes by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and myelin digestion by macrophages. Naturally, a heavy emphasis on the immune response to selfantigens is the premise of these models, but such cascades could still be easily compatible with the presence of microbial agents as the primary inciting events, or as modulatory factors during ongoing inflammation. After 50 years, no breakthrough evidence to support either a pure autoimmune pathogenesis or a direct destructive infection of white matter components has become available.",

Indeed, microbial epitopes resembling myelin basic protein have been shown to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [50\u2022\u2022] , and fine specificities of altered epitopes capable of inhibiting the self response are under study. However, Guillain-Barre syndrome and paraneoplastic disorders in which molecular mimicry is thought to play a central role are either mainly monophasic or subacute progressive disorders, not characterized by frequent relapses. Additionally, some viruses may act as superantigens [40] that bind outside the antigen grove, and activate whole classes of T cells, including autoreactive T cells specific for myelin antigen(s), which once activated may cross the blood-brain barrier.",

Theoretically, latent viral infection of oligodendrocytes (capable of frequent mutations) may occasionally express novel gene products that will be recognized as foreign, and the immune system will eventually mount an inflammatory response with extensive local damage. The relative immune privilege of the CNS may support such damage, because single cells harboring the virus will remain undetected and the immune response delayed, enabling tissue alteration to spread locally, causing a more extensive response later. Other possibilities are even more hypothetical. For instance, double infections, in which products of one infectious process enhance a nonspecific or specific responses to a second or a latent pathogen, might be also considered.",
