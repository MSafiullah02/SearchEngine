Mobilisation now will allow us to apply the learnings gained to any future periods of increased infection and lockdown, which will be particularly important for front-line workers and for vulnerable groups, and to future pandemics. We propose a framework for the prioritisation and coordination of essential, policy-relevant psychological, social, and neuroscientific research, to ensure that any investment is efficiently targeted to the crucial mental health science questions as the pandemic unfolds. We use the term mental health sciences to reflect the many different disciplines, including, but not limited to, psychology, psychiatry, clinical medicine, behavioural and social sciences, and neuroscience, that will need to work together in a multidisciplinary fashion together with people with lived experience of mental health issues or COVID-19 to address these research priorities.",

A fragmented research response, characterised by small-scale and localised initiatives, will not yield the clear insights necessary to guide policy makers or the public. Rigorous scientific and ethical review of protocols and results remains the cornerstone of safeguarding patients and upholding research standards. Deploying a mental health science perspective3 to the pandemic will also inform population-level behaviour change initiatives aimed at reducing the spread of the virus. International comparisons will be especially helpful in this regard. In this Position Paper, we explore the psychological, social, and neuroscientific effects of COVID-19 and set out clear immediate priorities and longer-term strategies for each of these aspects.",

            "text": "We also surveyed the public and people with lived experience of mental ill-health (panel 1\n). The general population survey, done by Ipsos MORI,4 revealed widespread concerns about the effect of social isolation or social distancing on wellbeing; increased anxiety, depression, stress, and other negative feelings; and concern about the practical implications of the pandemic response, including financial difficulties. The prospect of becoming physically unwell with COVID-19 ranked lower than these issues related to the social and psychological response to the pandemic. The MQ: Transforming Mental Health stakeholder survey of people with lived experience of a mental health issue likewise highlighted general concerns about social isolation and increased feelings of anxiety and depression. More specifically, stakeholders frequently expressed concerns about exacerbation of pre-existing mental health issues, greater difficulty in accessing mental health support and services under pandemic conditions, and the effect of COVID-19 on the mental health of family members, especially children and older people. Both surveys are reported online.4 These findings, combined with the published scientific literature, informed the development of our research priorities. The surveys represent a snapshot of the current situation, but they will need to be repeated more rigorously over the course of the pandemic, and the research priorities reviewed.Panel 1MethodologyThis Position Paper summarises the priorities put forward by an interdisciplinary group of 24 world-leading experts, including people with lived experience of a mental health issue, from across the bio-psycho-social spectrum of expertise in mental health science in March and April, 2020. The experts were convened by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the mental health research charity, MQ: Transforming Mental Health. Members participated in an individual capacity, not as representatives of their organisations. A coordinating group of seven experts met daily over a period of two weeks to develop the research priorities, informed by input from the expert advisory group. Given the need to develop the research priorities rapidly to inform immediate funding priorities, extended evidence gathering and consultation was not possible. However, we are confident that the wide breadth of expertise on the expert group and their leading roles in their respective fields provide a wide-ranging and comprehensive view of the mental health and neuroscience research priorities now; priorities which should be reviewed and should evolve with the pandemic.Lived experience of a mental health issue was incorporated by four mechanisms. First, three representatives with lived experience provided input as part of the expert advisory group. Second, an online survey collected data on people's two biggest concerns about the mental health and wellbeing implications of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the coping strategies used by patients. The survey was promoted via email to MQ's supporter network and via social media. In total, 2198 people completed the survey, submitting 4350 concerns about the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and 1987 responses about what has helped to maintain mental health and wellbeing during the pandemic. A thematic analysis of the full dataset was done. Third, two questions were asked on Ipsos MORI's online Omnibus survey to collect data on people's concerns about the effect of COVID-19 on mental wellbeing and what is helping people's mental wellbeing at this time. In total, 1099 interviews were completed with adults aged between 16 and 75 years from across England, Wales, and Scotland. Quotas were set and data were weighted to the offline population to ensure a nationally representative sample by gender, age, and region. Statistical analysis was done and any subgroup differences included are statistically significant at a 95% confidence interval unless stated otherwise. A summary report of the findings of both surveys and further methodological details can be found online.4 The Ipsos MORI tabular data can be found on its website.5 Finally, the manuscript was peer-reviewed by a reviewer with lived experience of a mental health issue. We acknowledge the limitations of our surveys, including the representativeness of the MQ sample, the short timescale for input, and the representativeness of online populations. We also acknowledge the restricted evidence gathering and opportunity for wider consultation of people with lived experience. However, combined, these four mechanisms of collecting input from people with lived experience provide important insight into people's concerns about the effect of COVID-19 on mental health and coping strategies within the very short timeframe.A living systematic map6 is tracking emerging empirical studies, systematic reviews, and modelling on COVID-19. As of April 1, 2020, 643 records were identified in the databases MEDLINE and Embase. Only ten of these were on mental health effects of the pandemic.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16\n",

The digital response is crucial,37, 38, 39 not only because of social isolation measures but also because less than a third of people who die by suicide have been in contact with mental health services in the 12 months before death.40 Digital interventions for anxiety, depression, self-harm, and suicide include information provision, connectivity and triage, automated and blended therapeutic interventions (such as apps and online programmes), telephone calls and messages to reach those with poorer digital resources (digital poverty),41 suicide risk assessments, chatlines and forums, and technologies that can be used to monitor risk either passively or actively.

They might also be affected by exposure to substance misuse, gambling, domestic violence and child maltreatment, absence of free school meals, accommodation issues and overcrowding, parental employment, and change and disruption of social networks.Older adults and those with multimorbidities might be particularly affected by issues including isolation, loneliness, end of life care, and bereavement, which may be exacerbated by the so-called digital divide.People with existing mental health issues, including those with severe mental illnesses, might be particularly affected by relapse, disruptions to services, isolation, the possible exacerbation of symptoms in response to pandemic-related information and behaviours, and changes in mental health law.Front-line health-care workers might be affected by fears of contamination, moral injury, disruption of normal supportive structures, work stress, and retention issues.People with learning difficulties and neurodevelopmental disorders might be affected by changes and disruption to support and routines, isolation, and loneliness.Society might experience increased social cohesion and communitarianism, but also be negatively affected by increased health inequalities, increased food bank use, increased race-based attacks, and other trauma. Rural communities might also be affected differently to urban communities.Socially excluded groups, including prisoners, the homeless, and refugees, might require a tailored response.People on low incomes face job and financial insecurity, cramped housing, and poor access to the internet and technology.",

It is not known whether SARS-CoV-2 can follow the same path to infect the human brain or whether it invades nerve cells by hijacking angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),104, 105, 106 despite neurons expressing low amounts of the protein, as described in a preprint107 and two other published studies.108, 109 Alternatively, SARS-CoV-2 might invade the brain from the blood, if circulating particles of the virus were transported across the blood\u2013brain barrier by binding to ACE2 receptors expressed by endothelial cells,109 or if infected leucocytes could carry the virus with them as they migrate into the tissues as part of the immune response to infection.110 Better understanding of how the intense systemic immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection affects mental health and neurological symptoms,97, 111, 112 and of the mechanisms of immune clearance of SARS-CoV-2, is also needed.113, 114\n",

Existing cohorts or data platforms that can be rapidly deployed for COVID-19 research are likely to be particularly valuable. Examples include the National Institute for Health Research National Bioresource, a platform that already includes clinical and genetic data on participants, and could be deployed for rapid characterisation of mental health and neurological symptoms. UK Biobank has successfully done a web-based mental health survey of 160 000 individuals, and the ongoing neuroimaging studies of 100 000 individuals with some repeat imaging, provide an ideal opportunity to image the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the brain and the brainstem via a before-and-after imaging comparison.",

            "text": "Patient and public involvement in research is a critical underpinning component to research. Given that the entire population has lived experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers will need to be particularly mindful of consulting and collaborating with patient and public groups that reflect the diverse groups being studied when developing protocols, conducting research, and interpreting results (panel 4\n).Panel 4Principles of good research practice in COVID-19 research\nStudy design\nResearchers must continue to describe the patient group or population and the research question under study. A priori research questions are crucial. Sample size, sources of bias, participant characteristics (including sex, age, and ethnicity), and study design need to be carefully considered and must be appropriate to the research questions.\nEthics\nResearch on human participants should maintain high standards of ethical practice, including seeking research ethics committee approval.124 Committees now have fast-track procedures to expedite study start up. Ethical considerations for doing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related research have been published.125, 126\n\nVulnerable groups\nResearchers should recognise the capacity of the pandemic to exacerbate health inequalities within populations, particularly affecting people with established mental health issues (including severe mental illnesses) and physical disability. Those with precarious or no employment or housing, or other forms of social inequality, such as digital poverty,41 should also be considered.\nInvolvement of patients, people with lived experience, and the public\nResearchers should continue to engage and involve patients, people with lived experience, the public, and service providers in their work by mutually setting research questions, testing the acceptability of protocols and questionnaires, and interpreting results. Researchers should ensure that they discuss their research findings with participants.\nHarmonised data and measures\nThere is an obvious need for researchers to use and share full study protocols and measures, where possible. This will facilitate comparisons between data and projects. The urgency of the research effort should be a strong driver for the principles of open science, reproducibility, and data sharing. The ready availability of analysis code and data is essential to verifying findings. Broad adoption of the registered reports publication model,127 including rapid peer review of study protocols before data collection, will help to minimise waste and ensure conclusions are empirically sound.\nInterdisciplinary working\nThe challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic requires imaginative collaborations between disciplines, including, but not limited to, psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, virology, intensive care medicine, and respiratory medicine. Previous experience with epidemics has shown the \u201cessential role that the humanities and social sciences play in information, reduction of fear and stigma, prevention, screening, treatment adherence, and control policies\u201d.128\n\nCollaboration and coordination\nWhere possible, research protocols should be deployed at scale harnessing existing research infrastructures, including the Clinical Research Networks, Biomedical Research Centres, Mental Health Translational Research Collaboration, MQ Data Science group, charities, service user groups, and professional bodies. To avoid waste and protect against participant fatigue, it is essential that there is national coordination across research groups. International collaboration and a global perspective would also be beneficial.",
