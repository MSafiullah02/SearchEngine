The disease emerged in the Guangdong province of China in late 2002 [2] and spread to 29 countries mostly within Asia, although Europe and North America were also affected, notably Toronto, Canada. The epidemic was finally controlled by July 2003 through strict implementation of quarantine and isolation procedures, culling of wild animals in live exotic animal markets and international collaboration under the coordination of WHO [3]. By the end of the outbreak, the CDC and WHO reported 8098 cases with a 9.6% case fatality rate [4]. Only sporadic cases have been reported since then, mainly linked to laboratory exposure.",

Sequence analysis showed that it was a previously unrecognized coronavirus, SARS-CoV [7], [8], [9]. Serological and genetic evidence supports a zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV [10], [11]. Animal traders working with masked palm civets in China had high prevalence for SARS-CoV antibody, although they had no history of SARS-like disease. SARS-CoV-like viruses that were isolated from civets and raccoon dogs had more than 99% homology with human SARS-CoV, with major differences found in ORF8, whose deletion has been suggested to represent a sign of adaptation to humans [12]. Only four amino acid residues in the receptor glycoprotein ACE2-binding domain of the viral spike protein differ between the human epidemic SARS-CoV strains and civet strains, but they cause more than a 1000-fold difference in binding affinity to the ACE2 molecule [13], [14]. Although a high prevalence of SARS-like coronaviruses were found in Chinese horseshoe bats [15], [16], their great genetic diversity makes it difficult to identify which one might be the ancestor of SARS-CoV and to decide with certainty whether bats indeed are the animal reservoir of the virus.",

Pathology in SARS patients has been associated with diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and multinucleated giant cell infiltrates of epithelial or macrophage origin, suggestive of syncytium-like formation in the lung. The virus can be recovered from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, respiratory secretions, stools, urine and even sweat (for a review, see [19]). SARS vaccine development efforts were initiated very rapidly after the identification of the etiologic agent, even though the immune correlates of protection were not known. Research efforts to identify protective antigens and to develop animal models were undertaken in parallel with efforts to develop candidate vaccines [20], drawing on experience with animal coronavirus vaccines and using several vaccine strategies, including inactivated virus vaccines, purified subunit vaccines, plasmid DNA and viral vector-based vaccines as well as virus-like particles. Much effort has been made to identify appropriate animal models for SARS-CoV replication and pathogenesis. Several research groups have shown that mice [21], [22], ferrets [23], hamsters [24] and nonhuman primates [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30] support replication of SARS-CoV with varying degrees of associated disease.",

The S protein can be divided into two domains by analogy with other coronavirus spike proteins: an N-terminal S1 domain, which contains the receptor-binding site and neutralization epitopes and a C-terminal S2 domain which forms the membrane-anchored stalk region and contains a putative fusion peptide followed by two heptad repeats predicted to form a six-helix coiled-coil bundle [41].",

Moreover, the protective effect of the vaccine should be demonstrated in more than one animal species expected to react with a response predictive for humans. The endpoint of animal studies should be clearly related to the desired benefit in humans (i.e. enhancement of survival or reduction in major morbidity), and the data generated should allow selection of an effective dose in humans. At the present time it is uncertain whether the \u201canimal rule\u201d would apply to licensure of a SARS vaccine. However, it is important to develop standardized animal models and immunological assays in preparation for this eventuality.",

This report endeavors to summarize the recommendations from this meeting, based on consensus agreement. Recommendations for use of each animal model are given in Section 2 below.

At this time, no single model offers a direct reproduction of what was seen in humans with SARS. Pathology (including pneumonitis, alveolar edema, and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)) in humans is probably the most difficult element to reproduce in an animal model. Attention also should be given to the reduction of viral shedding because this would likely correlate with decreased risk of further spread of the disease among humans. In using animal models to study aspects of SARS-CoV infection, it must be emphasized that the kinetics of viral replication and appearance and resolution of pathological findings are much more rapid in animal models than in humans.",

Similar findings were reported after mucosal immunization of hamsters and AGMs using a bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3) vector expressing the SARS CoV S gene [33], [39]. Several whole inactivated virus and recombinant protein candidate vaccines also have been developed and shown to elicit a neutralizing antibody response that provided protection against infectious challenge [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60]. In addition, passively administered sera from vaccinated animals prevented SARS-CoV infection upon subsequent challenge of na\u00efve mice, demonstrating that antibodies induced by these vaccines did confer protection [37], [52].",

Enhanced disease and mortality have been observed in kittens immunized against or infected with a type-I coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), when subsequently exposed to FIPV infection [63], [64], [65]. Aggravated FIP is apparently a result of enhanced viral entry into macrophages mediated by sub-neutralizing antibody levels [66]. Children vaccinated with inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines developed serious disease on subsequent exposure to RSV [67], [68], [69]. Individuals exposed to one of the four serotypes of Dengue virus developed severe disease when subsequently infected with a second, different serotype [70], [71]. Enhanced disease following RSV vaccine or dengue infection occur by different mechanisms than FIPV. In view of such examples of enhanced disease following infection in a vaccinated host, there has been heightened concern that a similar phenomenon could occur with SARS-CoV vaccines. It was highly recommended, therefore, that known mechanisms of disease enhancement observed with other viruses and especially with other coronaviruses should be examined in SARS-CoV infections, especially in vaccinated animals. Although none of the studies to date have shown enhanced respiratory disease following SARS-CoV challenge in previously immunized animals, further studies in this area are warranted in view of some of the available in vitro data.",

This phenomenon was seen with pseudo-typed lentiviruses expressing SARS-CoV spike protein of civet sequence specificity, but not with pseudo-typed viruses expressing spike proteins of human SARS-CoV isolates. It also was not observed with human isolates of SARS-CoV. The role of enhanced viral entry, as observed in these in vitro studies, has not been related to any known component of human disease or infection in vivo.

Although these findings are worrisome, several questions were raised regarding the significance of the observation. The MVA-SARS-S vaccine used in these experiments was poorly immunogenic in the ferrets. The question of whether there could have been any co-pathogen in the animals was raised. It also would be important to know if the observed phenomenon depends on the MVA vector or on the animal model. It was strongly urged, therefore, that the experiment be repeated in ferrets. Additional experiments, in nonhuman primates and hamsters, looking for evidence of enhanced respiratory and hepatic diseases upon vaccination and challenge were also encouraged.",

It is important that a sufficient number of ampoules (2000\u20133000) be prepared so as to provide for about 10 years of use, and that the activity of the contents remain stable over this period. The process of establishing a WHO IS involves an international collaborative study, in which the candidate IS is compared with other samples. If the results of the tests are suitable, the candidate IS assigned a provisional arbitrary unitage, a report is distributed for approval by study participants and for eventual approval by the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization (ECBS). The preparation, storage and distribution of over 90% of IS have been undertaken by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) at South Mimms (UK), which is a WHO Laboratory for Biological Standards.",

Another issue is the degree of antigenic homology between the viral antigen used for the preparation of the IS and the virus used in the assays. In a JEV collaborative study, a candidate antibody IS, which had been prepared from the sera of vaccinees immunized with an inactivated vaccine that was antigenically different from some of the viruses used in VN assays, demonstrated that the response to at least some inactivated vaccine is strain specific and the candidate IS was consequently not established by the WHO ECBS. Whether a panel of monoclonal antibodies to SARS-CoV could be used to prepare an IS is an attractive alternative which should be explored.",
