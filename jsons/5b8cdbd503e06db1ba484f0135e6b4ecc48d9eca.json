More than 100 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are approved or in late stage clinical trials, many of which harness the potent FccR-mediated effector systems to varying degrees. This is most evident for antibodies targeting cancer cells inducing antibody-dependent killing or phagocytosis but is also true to some degree for the mAbs that neutralize or remove small macromolecules such as cytokines or other Igs. The use of mAb therapeutics has also revealed a \"scaffolding\" role for FccR which, in different contexts, may either underpin the therapeutic mAb action such as immune agonism or trigger catastrophic adverse effects. The still unmet therapeutic need in many cancers, inflammatory diseases or emerging infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires increased effort on the development of improved and novel mAbs. A more mature appreciation of the immunobiology of individual FccR function and the complexity of the relationships between FccRs and antibodies is fueling efforts to develop more potent \"next-gen\" therapeutic antibodies. Such development strategies now include focused glycan or protein engineering of the Fc to increase affinity and/or tailor specificity for selective engagement of individual activating FccRs or the inhibitory FccRIIb or alternatively, for the ablation of FccR interaction altogether. This review touches on recent aspects of FccR and IgG immunobiology and its relationship with the present and future actions of therapeutic mAbs.",

Since then, mAbs have become one of the most clinically successful therapeutic modalities across a diverse array of diseases. They have revolutionized the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases and of some cancers including otherwise incurable malignancies. 1 They are commercially important and in 2017, five mAbs collectively grossed $45.6 billion in sales, placing them in the top ten drugs globally. 2 MAb development is expanding rapidly with over 100 mAbs approved for clinical use or in late-stage clinical trials and over 600 in various stages of clinical development. 1 The therapeutic actions of mAbs can take many formsneutralization of the target such as cytokines in autoimmune disease, clearance of the target such as virus in infection or immunoglobulin (Ig)E in allergy, induction of innate effector cell activation that leads to target destruction by direct killing or the induction of apoptosis and the induction of adaptive immunity. Most therapeutic mAbs are IgG in origin and the heavy-chain subclass determines many of their biological properties including their long plasma half-life 3 ; complement activation, which is important in the action of some cytotoxic mAbs [4] [5] [6] and importantly engagement by their fragment crystallizable (Fc) region with specific cell surface receptors, called FccR, the subject of this review.",

            "text": "In normal homeostatic immunity, there is a balance between IgG immune complex activation of proinflammatory responses through the activating-type FccRs-which leads to the destruction of opsonized pathogens-and of the modulation of these destructive effector responses by the inhibitory-type FccR, thereby avoiding injury to the host. Thus, therapeutic mAbs powerfully exploit these opposing activities, making them versatile drugs whose therapeutic potency can be improved by specific engineering of Fc-FccR interactions. 7 Many therapeutic mAbs depend, to varying degrees, on FccR function ( Figure 1 , Table 1 ) for their mechanism of action (MOA) and/or their pharmacokinetic properties. For some mAbs interaction with FccR is central to their MOA, such as the destruction of a target cell by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC; Figure 1a ) or antibodydependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (phagocytosis or ADCP; Figure 1b ). This also includes mAbs that may harness the inhibitory action of FccRIIb to modulate the proinflammatory responses of immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM)-dependent receptor signaling complexes (Figure 1c ). For other mAbs, FccR may play a secondary role, such as the removal or \"sweeping\" of all immune complexes formed by cytokine or virus-specific neutralizing antibodies or of opsonized fragments of lysed target cells which in antigen-presenting cells may also feed the antigen into the antigen-presentation pathways (Figure 1d ). In addition, FccRs, particularly FccRIIb (Figure 1e ), are also key participants in the MOA of immune-stimulating agonistic mAbs or apoptotic mAbs by acting as a scaffold for the additional cross-linking of mAbs already bound to a cellular target, thereby inducing a signal in the target cell.",

(c) Inhibition of cell activation by FccRIIb. The immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM)-mediated signaling of B-cell antigen receptors (left) or of activating FccR (right) on innate immune cells such as macrophages and basophils is inhibited by IgG Fc-mediated co-cross-linking of these activating receptors with the inhibitory FccRIIb. This leads to phosphorylation of the FccRIIb immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and consequently recruits the phosphatases that modulate the ITAM-driven signaling responses leading to diminished cell responses. (d) Sweeping or internalization of small immune complexes leading to their removal and, in APC, to enhanced immune responses. (e) Scaffolding in which the FccRs play a passive role. Typically involving FccRIIb, no signal is generated in the effector cell but \"super-cross-linking\" of the opsonizing antibody by the FccR on one cell generates a signal in the conjugated target cell, for example, induction of apoptosis or activation in agonistic expansion of cells and/or their secretion of cytokines.

It is also present on platelets but its role in effector functions is not established but it is important in certain immune thrombocytopenias. A polymorphic form of this receptor is the only human receptor for human IgG2. This, together with its limited species expression and unique ITAM-containing cytoplasmic tail (reviewed by Anania et al. 11 ), suggests a unique function in human leukocytes. Interestingly, polymorphism of the receptor is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and resistance to Gram-negative organisms. 11 A rare, hyper-responsive form is a risk factor for neutrophil-driven anaphylaxis in Ig replacement therapy. 22 FccRIIc is an activating FccR whose expression is regulated single nucleotide polymorphism that permits expression in approximately 20% of humans and in whom it is present at low levels on natural killer (NK) and B cells. 11 It has arisen by gene duplication/ recombination resulting in an extracellular region derived from FccRIIb, which binds IgG4, and with an ITAM-containing cytoplasmic tail related to the activating receptor FccRIIa. Thus FccRIIc provides IgG4 with an activation receptor pathway and confers a new biology of IgG4 in these individuals. Its low frequency in the population may also confound in vivo mAb clinical testing or use, but as yet there is no evidence for this.",

It is expressed, predominantly and abundantly, on human neutrophils. 7 Its effector function depends in part on its coexpression with FccRIIa. The lack of FccRIIIb on macaque neutrophils appears to be compensated for by an increase in FccRIIa expression. 15 FccRIIbs are the inhibitory-type FccR and arise from a single gene. They lack intrinsic proinflammatory signaling and are instead immune checkpoints. They provide feedback regulation by antibodies, in the form of immune complexes, to inhibit B-cell activation by specific antigen. They also control activating-type FccR function on innate cells. Two major splice variant forms of FccRIIb exist with differential tissue expression profiles. FccRIIb1 preferentially expressed on B lymphocytes contains a 20-amino acid cytoplasmic insertion necessary for membrane retention and cocapping with the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR). FccRIIb2 is the predominant inhibitory receptor found on basophils and neutrophils, as well as on subpopulations of mast cells, dendritic cells and some monocytes/macrophages. FccRIIb2 lacks the cytoplasmic insertion of FccRIIb1 and consequently can internalize rapidly including with the activating FcR when they are co-cross-linked. 11 It is not clear which form is present on human T cells.",

Upon cell activation, cytoskeletal remodeling is associated with the loss of the receptor corrals, allowing FccRs and other receptors to freely diffuse, engage ligand, cluster and signal. 39 The influence of such surface constraints on receptors and effector cell function helps explain some of the observed epitope distance requirements for optimal mAb function, 39, 41 which were apparent in a comparative study of ADCC and ADCP. 42 ADCC was optimal when the epitope was displayed close, 0.3 nm \"flush\" or 1.5 nm, to the target membrane where close conjugation of effector and target by the mAb presumably facilitates the delivery of pore-forming proteins to the target membrane as required by ADCC. Interestingly, complement-dependent cytotoxicity which also utilizes poreforming proteins for its cytotoxicity has similar distance constraints. By contrast, ADCP was poor when targeting epitopes displayed close or \"flush\" to the target cell membrane (within~0.3 nm) but ADCP activity was restored when the epitope was displayed 1.5 nm off the membrane, demonstrating different optimal epitope distance requirements for ADCC and ADCP. 42 Although the action of agonistic/antagonistic mAbs is mechanistically distinct to those eliciting cytotoxicity and ADCP, the distance segregation between target and FccR + cells is also important. Indeed, the membrane proximal epitopes of CD28 and CD40 are important for the FccR function in the complex MOA of these mAbs. 43, 44 Clearly, the effects of immune complex valency, Fc density, presentation and geometry together with FccR organization in the cell membrane suggest that the development of mAbs to certain targets will be heavily influenced by the context of use. Thus, improved mAb potency may not necessarily be achieved by engineering of the Fc polypeptide or its glycan alone. A more function-oriented approach early in mAb selection and development by, for example, application of rapid screening technologies that select for effector potency, 34 followed by Fc engineering may be more productive.",

This avidity effect is necessary as the FccRs operate in vivo in environments of high concentrations of uncomplexed monomeric IgG (normally 3-12 g L -1 ). Thus, the avid multivalent binding of the complex out competes uncomplexed, monomeric IgG. The notable exception to this is the enigmatic FccRI.

In stark contrast, in IgG2 and IgG4 the interaction of the CH3 domains of each H-chain is weak. Residues 392, 397 and 409 (Eu numbering) profoundly affect the stability of these interactions. The difference at position 409 (R 409 in IgG4 and K 409 in IgG1) confers a 100-fold decrease in stability of the interface between the two CH3 domains of IgG4 compared with that of IgG1 (Table 3) . 69 Furthermore, the core hinge of IgG4 differs from IgG1 at position 228 (P 228 in IgG1 and S 228 in IgG4), resulting in unstable inter-heavy-chain disulfide bonds. This, together with the destabilizing amino acids in the CH3, confers the unique property of half-antibody (Fab arm) exchange between different IgG4 antibodies, 69 thereby creating monovalent, bispecific IgG4 antibodies in vivo. 69, 70 The similarly unstable interactions between the CH3 domains in IgG2 are conferred by the interface residue M 397 ; however, the stable inter-H-chain disulfide bonds of the core and upper hinge prevent half-molecule exchange (Table 3) . 69 In addition, IgG2 uniquely has three disulfide bond conformers ( Table 3 ). The distinct conformers are formed when (1) each light chain is attached to the Cys 131 residue of CH1 in the heavy chain (IgG2-A conformer), (2) both light chains attach to the upper hinge (IgG2-B) or (3) one light chain is attached to the CH1 Cys 131 and one to the upper hinge of the other heavy chain (IgG2-AB). 71 This results in distinct positioning of the Fabs relative to the Fc portions in the different conformers, which has implications for the interaction with antigen and the capacity of IgG2 to cross-link target molecules in the absence of FccR binding, for example, in an agonistic mAb setting. 72 It should also be noted that IgG3 has not been used in therapeutic mAbs despite its unique biology. The main impediment to its use are its physicochemical properties such as susceptibility to proteolysis and propensity to aggregate that present challenges to industry-scale production and stability but protein engineering is attempting to overcome these hurdles. 73 Therapeutic antibody design: improving mAb potency Many factors affecting FccR-dependent responses in vivo come into play during mAb therapy. The experience of three decades of clinical use of mAbs taken together with our extensive, albeit incomplete, knowledge of IgG and FccR structure and immunobiology provides a war chest for the innovative development of new and highly potent mAbs through the manipulation of their interaction with the FccR.",

Their MOAs include direct induction of apoptotic cell death of the cancer cell (anti-CD20, anti-CD52) or blocking receptor signaling (anti-HER2, anti-EGFR). They may also harness FccR effector functions, including ADCC in the tumor microenvironment. 78 The approved mAbs, rituximab (anti-CD20), trastuzumab (anti-HER2) and cetuximab (anti-EGFR), are formatted on a human IgG1 backbone and all require activating-type FccR engagement for optimal therapeutic activity. 79, 80 This presents an example where context of therapeutic use is critical for therapeutic mAb design. IgG1 antibodies bind both the activating FccR (e.g. FccRIIIa) and the inhibitory FccRIIb. In some environments effector cells will coexpress FccRIIb together with FccRI, FccRIIa and FccIIIa, as may occur on a tumor-infiltrating macrophage. Therapy with an IgG1 anti-cancer cell mAb may then be compromised by the inhibitory action of FccRIIb upon the ITAM signaling of the activating FccR as both types of receptor would be coengaged on such an effector cell by the mAb bound to the target cell. This leads to reduced therapeutic mAb potency. Thus, the relative contributions of the activating (A) and inhibitory (I) FccR to the response by an effector cell, the A-to-I ratio, may be an important determinant in clinical outcome of therapeutic mAb activity, 76, 81, 82 that is, the higher the A-to-I ratio, the greater the proinflammatory response induced by the therapeutic mAb or conversely the lower the A-to-I ratio, the greater the inhibition or dampening of the proinflammatory response.",

Compared with their unmodified counterparts, the afucosyl mAbs showed dramatic improvement of FccRIII-related effector responses such as stronger NK cell-mediated ADCC, or enhanced neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis through FccRIIIb and/or FccRIIIa. 23 However, certain neutrophil functions via FccRIIa may be compromised. 90, 91 There are six afucosylated antibodies in late-stage clinical trials or approved for treatment (Table 4) . Notable is obinutuzumab, an afucosyl anti-CD20 mAb which nearly doubles progression-free survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients as compared with the fucose-containing rituximab. 68 This dramatic improvement in clinical utility reinforces the value of glycan engineering specifically and of Fc engineering generally in anticancer treatments.",

Notwithstanding the unexpected, and FccR-dependent, severe adverse reaction induced by the IgG4 TGN1412 mAb, the IgG4 or IgG2 backbones have been successfully used in many settings. Indeed, checkpoint inhibitors, such as mAbs targeting CTLA-4 or the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction for the suppression of inhibitory signals that contribute to immune tolerance in the tumor microenvironment, are formatted on an IgG4 backbone. Pembrolizumab, nivolumab and cemiplimab are all anti-PD-1 antibodies currently used for cancer therapy and have been formatted on an IgG4 backbone 95-97 with a stabilized core hinge (S 228 P) to prevent half-IgG4 exchange. Similarly, the checkpoint inhibitor tremelimumab is an anti-CTLA-4 antibody formatted on an IgG2 backbone to avoid potential ADCC killing of target cells. 98 However, the use of IgG2 and IgG4 as \"inert\" subclasses is problematic. Both bind to the activating receptors FccRIIa-H 131 and FccRI, respectively (Table 2) , and initiate effector functions such as neutrophil activation and apoptosis induction. 75, 99 Interestingly, in experimental systems, cross-linking of anti-PD-1 IgG4based mAb by FccRI switched its activity from blocking to activatory. 10 Moreover, IgG4 binds to FccRIIb, which may scaffold the therapeutic mAb. Although scaffolding may be beneficial in some contexts, for example, in immune agonism, 43 it can be disastrous and unexpected in others as it was for the anti-CD28 TGN1412 mAb. 59 Thus, the IgG2 and IgG4 subclasses are not the optimum choice for \"FcR-inactive\" mAbs, and so modifying the Fc is a more direct approach.",

The lower hinge amino acids of the IgG1 mAbs durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) and anifrolumab (anti-interferon-a receptor; Table 4 ) were modified to mimic the lower hinge of IgG4 (L 234 F). They additionally incorporated L 235 E in the lower hinge and P 331 S in the F/G loop of the CH2 domain to ablate FccR binding by disrupting two major FccR contact sites 7 and also coincidently decreasing C1q activation. 16 IgG4 mAbs have been similarly engineered to eliminate their interaction with FccRI and FccRIIb. The IgG4 anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab has had its FccR contact residues in the lower hinge E 233 , F 234 , L 235 substituted with the equivalent residues of IgG2 P, V, A (E 233 P, F 234 V, L 235 A) as well as the additional D 265 A mutation which disrupts a major FccR contact in CH2. It also has substitutions in the core hinge S 228 P and the CH3 L 309 V and R 409 K to stabilize the H-chain disulfides and CH3 interactions, respectively, thereby preventing half-Ig exchange characteristic of natural IgG4. Collectively, these modifications create a stable IgG4 with no FccR binding nor complement activation. 17 Thus, Fc engineering is an effective way to remove FccR effector functions and may be preferable to using unmodified IgG2 or IgG4 backbones that have a more restricted repertoire of FccR interactions but which are still able to induce certain effector functions.",

Indeed, such an approach may be most effective in emerging infectious disease such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The use of multiple mAbs tailored for distinct effector functions and targeting different epitopes will maximize the opportunity for cocktailing of effector functions in different types of diseases. Indeed, in a small but contemporary example outside of infectious disease, the FDA-approved combination in adenocarcinoma therapy uses a cocktail of two mAbs, pertuzumab and trastuzumab, against Her2. 123 Rather than one type of Fc to conquer all, the combined use of appropriately selected mAbs whose individual components are enhanced for the engagement of different FccR members may utilize multiple components of the spectrum of effector responses on offer by the immune system. Such \"next-gen\" biologics will begin to realize the full potential of FccR-mediated antibody immune therapeutics and offer transformational change for the treatment of intractable and incurable diseases.",
