The rapidly increasing of patients, especially the critical or mortal patients, brought a big challenge to the public health. Lai et al.3 found that mortality was correlated with country health care resources. However, in many countries, the invasive ventilator and intensive care unit (ICU) were far from adequate for the treatment of critical patients. Clinical workers should pay attention to the risk factors of COVID-19 critical disease and death, identify critical patients early, allocate medical resources rationally and timely adjust the treatment plan to enhance the efficacy and reduce the risk of death. In this article, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients with critical/mortal illness and non-critical illness in 13 literatures with 3027 patients, to identify the risk factors for COVID-19 patients to develop critical disease or death, in order to effectively predict the progression of the disease, make early treatment response and allocate medical resources in a better way.",

We used the I2 statistics to assess the magnitude of heterogeneity: 25%, 50%, and 75% represented low, moderate, and high degrees of heterogeneity, respectively. The chosen of the proper effect model was based on the analysis results: the fixed effect model was used if I2 \u2264 50% and the random effect model was used if I2>50%. If there was statistical heterogeneity among the results, a further sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the source of heterogeneity. After the significant clinical heterogeneity was excluded, the randomized effects model was used for meta-analysis. P < 0.05 was considered as statistical significance.",

And the SARS-CoV-2, which isolated from the lower respiratory tract of pneumonia patients with unknown causes in Wuhan, is identified as the seventh human coronaviruses.19 SARS-CoV-2 attacks the alveolar epithelial cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is the ACE of isozyme, mainly distributed in cardiovascular, kidneys, testes, lung and colon, and other organizations.20 The main role of ACE2 is to incise Ang II to generate Ang 1-7, which mediates the protective effects of vasodilation, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferation, to antagonize Ang II-induced vascular smooth muscle contraction, cell proliferation, fibrosis promotion and vascular inflammation.21, 22, 23 When SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptor on the surface of alveolar epithelial cells, The expression of ACE2 in alveolar epithelial cells is down-regulated by mechanisms such as internalization, shedding and viral replication.24 Then the increased concentration of Ang II leads to inflammatory response, and exudation of neutrophils, macrophages and fibrinous, resulting in loss of pulmonary ventilation function and difficulty in maintaining oxygenation.25 At the same time, viral infection will cause the imbalance of T helper-1 and T helper-2 responses, and induce an inflammatory storm by increasing the levels of inflammatory factors such as interleukin-4, interleukin-10 and interleukin-6.26 Inflammatory storm in critical patients releases cytokines, causing systemic immune injury, which may be an important cause of multiple organ failure and even death.27\n",

As a result, the majority of critical or mortal patients are male. As the body's immunity declines with age, elderly patients are more likely to develop critical illness or even die. Therefore, when the patient is male, over 65 years old and smoking, the patient has a higher risk of developing critical illness or death.",

Moreover, the long-term history of diabetes and hypertension will damage the vascular structure, and it is more likely to develop into critical disease in infection. Patients with chronic heart disease are more likely to be infected due to their weakened heart function and low immunity. When infected with SARS-CoV-2, they are more likely to have acute cardiovascular events and develop into severe diseases. When the patient has previous respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the patient's lung function is damaged. They have lower resistance to the virus and are prone to developing ARDS. Thus, underlying diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease or respiratory disease are risk factors for disease progression.

Various inflammatory factors produced by the inflammatory storm can cause systemic immune damage and even cause multi-organ failure. When the patient's laboratory indicator shows PCT > 0.5 ng/mL, there is a higher risk of progression to critical illness. Study showed that the total number of WBC in the early stage of the disease is normal or reduced.6 However, WBC < 4 \u00d7 109/L means a better clinical outcome in this paper. Therefore, when the total number of WBC is found to be higher than the previous one, the patient may be associated with other infections that aggravated the disease. At this moment, the clinicians might pay more attentions to these patients and improve treatment. When AST > 40U/L, LDH > 245U/L and Cr \u2265 133 mol/L, it indicates that the liver and kidney dysfunctions have been involved, and corresponding treatments should be taken in time to prevent further deterioration of the disease. Current studies have shown that up to 20% of covid-19 patients have abnormal coagulation function.6 Monocytes and tissue cells are activated after injury, causing the release of cytokines and the expression of tissue factors, and finally causing the hypercoagulability of blood. It will increase the risk of thrombosis and more likely to cause ischemia and hypoxia due to the embolization of the viscera, which leads to the progression of the disease to critical disease or death. When the D-dimer > 0.5mg/L, it indicates the hypercoagulability of blood and suggests the deterioration of patients. At the same time, SARS-CoV-2 can cause myocardial injury by direct and/or indirect action. The direct injury is to infect cardiomyocytes by identifying ACE2 receptor, while the indirect injury may be caused by inflammatory storm inducing by immune response and/or oxygen supply imbalance inducing by acute respiratory distress syndrome. When hs-cTnI > 28pg/mL, it strongly suggests the possibility of further deterioration of the patient's condition.",
