It is caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV) and can have a zoonotic origin. Nearly 57,000 people die yearly from hepatitis E-related conditions. The disease is endemic in both developing and developed countries with distinct epidemiologic profiles. In developing countries, the disease is associated with inadequate water treatment, while in developed countries, transmission is associated with animal contact and the ingestion of raw or uncooked meat, especially liver. All human HEV are grouped into at least four genotypes, while HEV or HEV-related viruses have been identified in an increasing number of domestic and wild animal species. Despite a high genetic diversity, only one single HEV serotype has been described to date for HEV genotypes 1-4. The discovery of new HEV or HEV-related viruses leads to a continuing increase in the number of genotypes. In addition, the genome organization of all these viruses is variable with overlapping open reading frames (ORF) and differences in the location of ORF3. In spite of the role of some domestic and wild animals as reservoir, the origin of HEV and HEV-related viruses in humans and animals is still unclear. This review discusses aspects of the detection, molecular virology, zoonotic transmission and origin of HEV and HEV-related viruses in the context of 'One Health' and establishes a link between the previous and the new taxonomy of this growing virus family.",

Hepatitis E is usually a mild self-limiting disease; however, it may be fatal, especially among pregnant women in developing countries, or become chronic in immunocompromised individuals. Besides the infection of humans, HEV or HEV-related viruses have been identified in an increasing number of domestic and wild animal species (Smith et al., 2013) . Nearly 57,000 people die yearly from hepatitis E-related causes (WHO, 2013) . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 20 million people get infected with HEV and three million develop acute hepatitis every year (WHO, 2013) . The disease is endemic in both developing and developed countries although the epidemiological profile varies between countries according to the level of development. In developed countries, hepatitis E is more associated with animal contact and the ingestion of raw or uncooked meat, especially liver (swine, wild boar and deer) (Wichmann et al., 2008; Lewis et al., 2010) . In developing countries, hepatitis E is still linked to poor sanitary conditions ( (CDC) , C. f. D. C. a. P., 2013).",

The unknown viral agent was only identified in the eighties and named 'enterically transmitted non-A and non-B hepatitis' (ET-NANBH; Francis and Maynard, 1979; Sreenivasan et al., 1984) . Later in the nineties, the ET-NANBH virus was inoculated into cynomolgus monkeys, HEV cDNA was isolated for the first time, and the name 'HEV' was proposed (Reyes et al., 1990) . Since then the number of reports on HEV infections in the human population has increased considerably, showing that HEV was present in many different countries (Aye et al., 1992; Huang et al., 1992; Tsarev et al., 1992; Yin et al., 1994) .",

            "text": "Recently, the ICTV Hepeviridae Study Group proposed a new consensual classification, placing all the HEV and HEV-related viruses into two genera: Orthohepevirus with four species (A-D) and Piscihepevirus with a single species (A) (Smith et al., 2014) . The criteria proposed for this new classification were based on phylogeny and host range. Accordingly, Orthohepevirus A comprises sequences found in humans, pigs, wild boar, rabbit, deer, mongoose and camel; Orthohepevirus B contains viruses found in chickens; Orthohepevirus C encompasses sequences found in rats (HEV-C1) and ferrets (HEV-C2); and Orthohepevirus D, the bat virus (Table 1) . Genotypes were also proposed for Orthohepevirus A: genotypes HEV-1 and HEV-2 have only been identified in humans, genotypes HEV-3 and HEV-4 have been reported in both humans and different animal species and are associated with the zoonotic cases. Genotypes HEV-5 and HEV-6 have been found in wild boar in Japan and genotype HEV-7 in dromedary camels in Dubai (Table 1; Smith et al., 2014; Pavio et al., 2010) . Partial sequences from other potential members of the family were recently identified in moose, fox and mink. They show similarities to HEV in genome organization, size and phylogenetic analyses, suggesting they could represent new members of the Hepeviridae family. The moose virus appears to cluster closely to genotypes 1-7, while HEV isolated from mink is closely related to the ferret virus (HEV-C2), and the virus found in foxes is related to that in rats (HEV-C1) virus ( Fig. 1 ; Lin et al., 2013; Woo et al., 2014; Batts et al., 2011; Raj et al., 2012; Drexler et al., 2012) . These viruses have not been placed in any specific genotype because complete genomic sequences are required to place these viruses definitively.",

            "text": "Classification under the genotype level is very useful and important for both clinical and epidemiological studies. The most frequently used classification was proposed by Lu et al. (2006) and encompasses 24 subtypes. Genotypes 1-4 are split into five (a-e), two (a-b), 10 (a-j) and seven (a-g) subtypes, respectively (Lu et al., 2006) . This classification is controversial and is not accepted by all researchers in the field. For instance, there are a number of publications including partial and complete genomic sequences of HEV with no differentiation under the genotype level Tei et al., 2003; Sonoda et al., 2004; Wibawa et al., 2004) . The main concern is related to the reliability of the subtype separation and, consequently, the usefulness of subtyping (Oliveira-Filho et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013) . The ICTV study group has not defined a permanent system for classification under genotype level (subgenotype or subtypes); however, it has recommended the use of approaches based on labelling clades according to tree topology (Smith et al., 2014) . Thus, genotype HEV-3 has been divided into three subgenotypes 3.1 (or G3 group 1), 3.2 (or G3 group 2) and 3.3 (Oliveira-Filho et al., 2013; Ijaz et al., 2014) , and genotype HEV-4 has been divided into seven subgenotypes 4 a-g (Dai et al., 2013) .",

Several other species such as tamarins, rhesus monkey, three-striped night monkey and the common chimpanzee were also successfully infected with HEV (Bradley et al., 1987; Gupta et al., 1990; Ticehurst et al., 1992; McCaustland et al., 2000) . Recently, it was demonstrated that the cynomolgus monkey is susceptible to infection with human and swine genotype 3 HEV from Argentina, Brazil and the Netherlands (de Carvalho et al., 2013) . These studies were very important in understanding different aspects of HEV infection in humans. Naturally occurring anti-HEV antibodies were reported in both free-living and captive non-human primates, and their role as reservoir has been discussed (Arankalle et al., 1994; Hirano et al., 2003b) . However, neither HEV nor HEVrelated viruses have been found naturally in non-human primates (Meng, 2011) .",

These sequences showed homology of 96-100% to each other and 76-86%, 82-84%, 79-85% and 84-96% homology with genotypes 1-4, respectively. Accordingly, the HEV sequences found in bovines were assigned to genotype 4 (Hu and Ma, 2010) . The same short HEV ORF2 sequence of 189 bp was amplified from six faecal samples of sheep by the same research group in China. These sequences showed homology of 99-100% between themselves and 79-85%, 81-83%, 79-84% and 85-95% homology with genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, and clustered into genotype 4 (Wang and Ma, 2010) . However, additional studies must be conducted to confirm the presence of viruses in these animal species, and longer sequences need to be isolated to confirm the genotype assignment. Recently, full genome sequences closely related to HEV-4 were detected in yak in China ( Fig. 1 ; Xu et al., 2014) .",

Subsequently, the complete genomes of the two HEV strains from rats were determined and it was suggested that they might belong to a new species within Hepeviridae (Johne et al., 2010) . Since then, new HEV-C1 sequences have been reported in Germany, USA, China, Vietnam and Indonesia (Johne et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013b,d) and specific HEV-C1 sequences were included in the species Orthohepevirus C genotype HEV-C1 (Smith et al., 2014) .

Due to this, from the late eighties to the early nineties, it was improbable that clinicians would diagnose autochthonous hepatitis E in industrialized countries (Scharschmidt, 1995) . However, the presence of HEV antibodies in healthy individuals and blood donors in Europe and North America could not always be associated with travel to an endemic region (Skaug et al., 1994) .

Rabbits may also represent a reservoir of HEV for humans (Izopet et al., 2012) . In addition, cynomolgus macaques and pigs have been experimentally infected with rabbit HEV (Cossaboom et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013) . It is important to note that human HEV does not formally need a reservoir as faecal-oral transmission is effective in maintaining the infection within a human population, as occurs in non-industrialized regions. However, secondary reservoirs in pigs and wild boar contribute to the maintenance of the infection (HEV genotypes 3 and 4) in developed countries with a high sanitary level. In addition, the presence of the virus in other wild species such as deer may contribute to the maintenance of the virus in the natural environment.",

HEV-C1 does not infect rhesus monkeys (Purcell et al., 2011) , and laboratory rats do not appear to be susceptible to genotypes 1, 3 and 4 (Li et al., 2013a,c) , although one study reported partial genotype 3 sequences in rat liver specimens (Lack et al., 2012) . Viruses found in birds could not be transmitted experimentally to primates (Huang et al., 2004) . The transmission of rat or avian HEV to humans cannot be completely ruled out, but these species are not currently considered to be reservoirs of human HEV. The possibility that bats may play a role as a reservoir of HEV in mammals, as reported for many viruses such as coronaviruses or paramyxoviruses, was examined. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that viruses found in bats belong to the Hepeviridae family and seem to be the most divergent mammalian hepeviruses described so far. Therefore, it is unlikely that bats transmit the virus to humans (Drexler et al., 2012) . It is also unlikely that the transmission from trout to humans occurs due to the phylogenetic gaps found between HEV and CTV sequences. The human susceptibility for moose and dromedary camel HEV-related viruses is still unknown and transmission to humans cannot be excluded.",

This might lead to a lower capacity of the virus to evolve in the domestic swine population. Instead, environmental and behavioural differences of the wild boar may allow a greater stabilization of the virus in this population and promote selection and maintenance of new viruses. A similar evolution may have occurred with the rabbit strain, starting from a related genotype 3 ancestor, but with a separate evolution in the rabbit population. The higher HEV prevalence in domestic swine than in wild animals could be explained by the continuous exchange of viruses between the human and the swine populations. In addition, the intensive contact among confined populations or farmed swine may increase the potential for infection.",

This Bayesian analysis considered neither recombination events nor host species evolution. However, hosts of Orthohepevirus C variants have been detected from Carnivora, Rodentia and Soricomorpha, and Orthohepevirus A variants have been detected from Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Lagomorpha and Primates. Such diversification of host orders suggests that HEV did not co-evolve with its hosts, but is more likely an opportunistic pathogen (Smith et al., 2014) . The division that might have led to the ancestors of human and swine hepevirus occurred at about the same time. The appearance of the HEV-C1 suggests that mammalian HEV could have been adapted to different mammalian species over time (Purdy and Khudyakov, 2010) . There is evidence that genotype 1 or an anthropotropic ancestor of genotype 1 has been responsible for acute hepatitis infections among adults since the last decade of the 18th century (Teo, 2012) . This indicates that either estimates for the time for the most recent common ancestor for genotype 1 are underestimated or genotype 1 has gone through an evolutionary bottleneck and the ancestor is a survivor of that bottleneck. The further discovery of other mammalian HEV-related viruses may help to improve the understanding of Hepeviridae evolution. However, the lack of fossil viruses, preventing a confirmation of statistical analyses conducted so far (Purdy and Khudyakov, 2010) , poses a challenge regarding the elucidation of the HEV (and HEV-related viruses) origin. Therefore, Hepeviridae origin analysis will remain speculative but allows a clarification of the current situation.",
