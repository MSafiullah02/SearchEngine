            "text": "The middle ear structures of eight species of mole in the family Talpidae (Mammalia: Eulipotyphla) were studied under light and electron microscopy. Neurotrichus, Parascalops, and Condylura have a simple middle ear cavity with a loose ectotympanic bone, ossicles of a \"microtype\" morphology, and they retain a small tensor tympani muscle. These characteristics are ancestral for talpid moles. Talpa, Scalopus, Scapanus, and Parascaptor species, on the other hand, have a looser articulation between malleus and ectotympanic bone and a reduced or absent orbicular apophysis. These species lack a tensor tympani muscle, possess complete bullae, and extensions of the middle ear cavity pneumatize the surrounding basicranial bones. The two middle ear cavities communicate in Talpa, Scapanus, and Parascaptor species. Parascaptor has a hypertrophied malleus, a feature shared with Scaptochirus but not found in any other talpid genus. Differences in middle ear morphology within members of the Talpidae are correlated with lifestyle. The species with middle ears closer to the ancestral type spend more time above ground, where they will be exposed to highfrequency sound: their middle ears appear suited for transmission of high frequencies. The species with derived middle ear morphologies are more exclusively subterranean. Some of the derived features of their middle ears potentially improve low-frequency hearing, while others may reduce the transmission of bone-conducted noise. By contrast, the unusual middle ear apparatus of Parascaptor, which exhibits striking similarities to that of golden moles, probably augments seismic sensitivity by inertial bone conduction.",

Certain anatomical features of the ear of fossorial rodents have been interpreted as adaptations mediating lowfrequency hearing (Burda et al., 1988 (Burda et al., , 1992 Lange et al., 2004; Schleich and Busch, 2004) . Others, however, have argued that rather than being truly specialized toward low-frequency hearing, the audition of pocket gophers and mole-rats is degen-erate and merely restricted to a low-frequency range by the loss of high-frequency sensitivity (Heffner and Heffner, 1990 , 1992b , 1993 . The assumption that the auditory apparatus of these animals is unusually receptive to low-frequency sound is therefore questionable.",

(1992) compared the middle ear structures of a range of fossorial species, including pocket gophers, spalacine, and bathyergid molerats, the talpid moles Talpa and Scalopus, and the golden mole Amblysomus, to those of terrestrial mammals. Some striking parallels were identified among the fossorial species, including a relatively larger eardrum lacking a pars flaccida, a larger stapes footplate area, a looser connection between malleus and tympanic bone, and reduced or missing middle ear muscles. In a wider study, Mason (2001) concluded that certain middle ear features such as an enlarged stapes footplate and reduced middle ear muscles are indeed characteristic of subterranean mammals in general.",

Mice and rats (Muridae) have often been used as \"acoustically unspecialized\" outgroups for comparison with fossorial rodent species (Burda et al., 1988 (Burda et al., , 1992 Br\u00fc ckmann and Burda, 1997) . However, mice and rats have restricted low-frequency hearing abilities, which is by no means the case in all terrestrial rodents (Heffner et al., 2001) . Many of the characteristically \"fossorial\" features of the middle ear apparatus of the tuco-tuco, Ctenomys sociabilis, are also found in this animal's nonfossorial caviomorph relatives (Mason, 2004b) , but not in mice and rats. Using distantly related, high-frequency specialists such as murids as outgroups in this case might therefore yield misleading conclusions about the evolution of the ear apparatus in tuco-tucos, or indeed in other distant relatives, such as bathyergid mole-rats.",

The most comprehensive comparative study to date was performed by Stroganov (1945) , who described the auditory ossicles of 10 genera of moles. Most of these studies are concerned with anatomy or phylogeny rather than with function, and almost nothing has ever been published on the middle ear structures of Neurotrichus gibbsii and Parascalops breweri, the only members of their respective genera.",

Recent phylogenies suggest that full fossoriality has evolved more than once within the family (Shinohara et al., 2003 (Shinohara et al., , 2004 Motokawa, 2004) , making the Talpidae ideal for an intrafamily study of ear evolution. Restricting the analysis to one family complements previous, wider-ranging studies, and, by avoiding problems associated with the use of potentially inappropriate outgroups, allows more confidence in the identification of true adaptations to a subterranean environment. In the present study, the ears of talpid moles from seven genera were dissected and studied in detail, and those of a further six genera were also examined. Part of this work stems from a doctoral dissertation (Mason, 1999) ; some preliminary anatomical findings have been briefly reported (Mason, 2001) .",

Some structural septa are present and the arteries of the middle ear form raised ridges, but there are no fine trabeculations. Although they approach each other at the midline, the right and left cavities remain completely separate. A vertical septum in the medial wall partially divides medial and rostromedial compartments, the latter containing the opening of the Eustachian tube. Lateral to these chambers is the tympanic cavity proper, containing the small promontory, the oval window, and the ossicles, the heads of which are in a shallow epitympanic recess. The fenestra cochleae is found within its own caudal chamber, as in the other moles. In Condylura and Parascalops, the arteries of the middle ear run in bony tubes that are complete except for a short section of the stapedial artery where it passes through the stapes. In Neurotrichus, the arteries are not enclosed in tubes except for the distal part of the promontorial artery.

The tensor tympani muscle inserts almost on this corner-point (Parascalops) or just rostral to it (Neurotrichus, Condylura: Fig. 5D ), there being a small muscular process marking the insertion in Parascalops and Neurotrichus.

The description of the malleus of Scalopus in the classic work of Doran (1878) mentions a muscular process and tensor tympani, and so may not in fact refer to this species; his assertion that the short process of the incus in Talpa is \"almost obsolete\" is misleading, given that this process is the insertion point of the strongest ligament in the ossicular chain in this species. Hyrtl (1845) denied the presence of an interbullar connection in Talpa, and Van der Klaauw (1931) asserts erroneously that the cavity of the inflated alisphenoid does not communicate with the tympanic cavity. The middle ear apparatus said to be that of Talpa europaea illustrated in Segall's work (1970 Segall's work ( , 1973 is instead probably a Euroscaptor species, whereas the basicranium illustrated by MacPhee et al. (1988) and labeled as the golden mole Chlorotalpa is actually a talpid mole, probably Talpa. The suspicions (Gaughran, 1954; Henson, 1961) that Wilkie (1929) had mistaken the chorda tympani for part of the anterior ligament of the malleus in Talpa are here confirmed. Pye's (1972) observation that the stapedius muscle appears to be absent in this species presumably refers in fact to the tensor tympani. Although Whidden (2000) was unable to find a tensor tympani muscle in any of the 12 species of moles that he studied, this muscle is present in at least three of those species (Condylura cristata, Parascalops breweri, and Neurotrichus gibbsii).",

These moles possess ectotympanic bones that are not fused to the rest of the skull, relatively simple middle ear cavities, and tensor tympani muscles. The malleus conforms to Fleischer's \"microtype\" morphology, found also in shrews, mice, and bats (Fleischer, 1978) . Microtype ossicles are associated with highfrequency hearing, and are characterized by the possession of a large orbicular apophysis, the functional significance of which is unclear. Desmans, the shrew-moles Uropsilus and Urotrichus, and the long-tailed mole Scaptonyx also fall into Group 1, although the condition of the tensor tympani is not known in most of these species and the orbicular apophysis is small in desmans. Given that the ear morphologies of other eulipotyphlan insectivores, both shrews, and larger species such as hedgehogs and Solenodon, are similar (Henson, 1961; Segall, 1970; Burda, 1979) , it is clear that the Group 1 middle ear morphology is ancestral for the Talpidae.",

However, the enlarged heads of the malleus and incus, the loose articulation of an abbreviated anterior process with the ectotympanic, and the relatively large incus in all Group 2 moles are \"freely mobile\" characteristics, found also in many other placental mammals including humans (Fleischer, 1978) . The incudal long process is excavated by a sulcus in most talpids, but only in Talpa among the species examined are large parts of the malleus and incus hollow. Euroscaptor and Mogera species, also \"highly fossorial,\" have similar ossicular morphologies to Talpa (Stroganov, 1945) .

            "text": "Characteristic 1. Possession of \"complete\" bony bullae is a common feature among mammals in general (Novacek, 1977) . It may permit a more vertical orientation of the tympanic membrane, potentially allowing a larger membrane and a more capacious middle ear cavity. If the acoustical stiffness of the cavity and membrane is limiting, expansion will reduce the overall stiffness of the middle ear, improving low-frequency sound transmission. Accordingly, certain gerbils and kangaroo-rats, small mammals known to have sensitive low-frequency hearing, have relatively enormous auditory bullae (Lay, 1972; Webster and Webster, 1975) . In moles, however, the tympanic membrane remains quite horizontal in position and the bulla is flattened, rather than forming a hemispherical salience on the basicranium, as is typical in mammals. Moles therefore lack markedly enlarged tympanic membranes and middle ear cavities on the scale of those seen in gerbils and kangaroo-rats, even when basicranial pneumatization is taken into account (Mason, 2001) . Webster (1966) suggested that the fusion of the ectotympanic to the basicranium in moles might improve the transmission of bone-conducted vibrations from the rest of the skull to the ear. Conversely, it is here proposed that a \"free\" ectotympanic would, due to its inertia, inevitably be able to vibrate relative to the skull within a certain frequency range, passing these vibrations via the ossicular chain to the inner ear. If so, fusion of the ectotympanic might actually reduce the overall bone conduction response within this range, reducing the impact of low-frequency bone-conducted noise on hearing. These competing hypotheses remain to be tested.",

Of course, accurate sound localization may not be important for many fossorial species living in essentially one-dimensional burrow systems (Heffner and Heffner, 1990) . However, the interbullar connection in some moles potentially allows sound localization by an alternative mechanism. It has been shown that there is good acoustic transmission through the head of Talpa europaea at frequencies up to around 6 kHz (Coles et al., 1982) . Sound therefore has access to both sides of the tympanic membrane, with phase differences depending on the direction of the source. Coles et al. (1982) propose that the ear acts as a pressuredifference receiver, as in some nonmammalian vertebrates: such a system could allow localization of sound even at low frequencies. Kudo et al.

Although the audition of talpid moles has not been investigated as thoroughly, Aitkin et al. (1982) found behavioral and electrophysiological responses to frequencies between 0.2 and 15 kHz in Talpa europaea, while Konstantinov et al. (1987) found electrophysiological responses up to 16 kHz in this species, and from 0.1 to 22 kHz in Mogera robusta. These results suggest that audition in Group 2 moles is also restricted to frequencies largely within the sonic range. Models of middle ear function, however, predict that hearing in fossorial rodents and talpids should extend to high ultrasonic frequencies (Hemil\u00e4 et al., 1995; Mason, 2001) . Although heavier than the microtype ossicles of Group 1 moles (Table 2) , the freely mobile ossicles of Group 2 species are simply not large enough to restrict highfrequency hearing significantly. Either other parts of the auditory system limit high-frequency hearing in these species, or high-frequency transmission through the middle ear is not, as is commonly as-sumed, limited by mass reactance (Overstreet and Ruggero, 2001) . The functional significance of the location of the center of mass in the auditory ossicles is discussed below.",

This feature cannot, therefore, be interpreted as an adaptation to improve auditory acuity. Alternatively, flexibility in the ossicular chain might reduce excessive stapes displacement and consequent inner ear damage in response to static pressure changes across the eardrum (Cancura, 1980; H\u00fc ttenbrink, 1988) , as might be experienced by a mole diving into and running through narrow tunnels. The malleo-incudal articulation is synostosed in some fossorial rodents (Burda et al., 1992; Mason, 2004b) , so there is no universal trend among subterranean mammals in this respect.",

Anatomical lever ratios in all talpids are below the nonfossorial mean of 2.24 (Mason, 2001) , and are also lowest in Group 2 species (Table 1) . Area and lever ratios are believed to contribute to the impedancematching function of the middle ear (Relkin, 1988) . Although anatomically measured ratios often differ from functional values measured in vivo (Khanna and Tonndorf, 1972; , low ratios are generally expected to result in poorer impedance matching, and thus less efficient transmission of sound through to the inner ear. However, rather than being caused by degenerative reduction of the pars tensa or malleus, the lower area and lever ratios in Group 2 moles are actually the result of an enlarged stapes footplate and an enlarged incus, respectively (Mason, 2001) .

Their conclusions are fully supported by the identification in the present study of the same characteristics as derived features of the ear in the highly fossorial Group 2 talpids. They therefore appear to represent convergent adaptations to a subterranean environment, but it is interesting to note that the adaptive values of three of them (6, 8, 9) are unclear. Although experimental confirmation is sorely lacking, six of the nine derived features of Group 2 talpids (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7) potentially improve low-frequency hearing. This would be adaptively advantageous to a fossorial mammal, exposed primarily to low frequencies that travel better underground. However, most of these six characteristics are relatively common among mammals, and there is little evidence to suggest that talpid low-frequency hearing would be superior to that of terrestrial species with freely mobile middle ears. A similar conclusion holds for fossorial rodents: although low-frequency auditory sensitivity in these animals is superior to that of \"microtype\" species such as rats, it is similar to (or worse than) that of other \"freely mobile\" rodents (Heffner and Heffner, 1993) .",

Skull vibrations may, in turn, be transmitted to the inner ear by any of several routes collectively referred to as \"bone conduction\" (Tonndorf, 1972) . Semi-fossorial Group 1 talpids might not be greatly troubled by boneconducted noise, especially if their auditory systems are tuned to high frequencies. However, bone conduction will be more significant for a highly fossorial mole, especially if the articulation between anterior process and ectotympanic is loosened and the ossicular mass is increased. In this case, bringing the center of mass of the ossicles closer to their rotatory axis will reduce transmission of bone-conducted vibrations to the inner ear by the ossicular inertial route (B\u00e1 r\u00e1 ny, 1938). As mentioned above, fusion of the ectotympanic to the basicranium in moles might reduce a different but comparable form of inertial bone conduction.",

Although the mass distribution within the \"freely mobile\" ossicular chains of Group 2 moles apparently serves to minimize inertial bone conduction, there are other modes of bone conduction by which vibrations could be transmitted to the inner ear. Vibratory sensitivity can also be conferred by the somatosensory system: Nannospalax mole-rats have recently been shown to be able to use their paws to detect seismic signals (Kimchi et al., 2005) .

Although the ossicular hypertrophy is much less extreme than in some golden mole genera, the malleus of Parascaptor leucura shows similar adaptations. The center of mass of the ossicular chain is located near the middle of the malleus in this species, well displaced from the rotatory axis (Fig. 7) . The Parascaptor ossicles resemble the microtype ossicles of Group 1 moles in this respect, but they are considerably heavier (Table 2 ) and are only loosely attached to the skull.

Coupled with a very low area ratio, also a feature of certain golden moles (Mason, 2001) , the impedance-matching of the Parascaptor middle ear is expected to be very inefficient, and the relatively heavy ossicles may restrict high-frequency hearing (but note earlier caveats regarding predictions of this nature).",

The ear ossicles of Scaptochirus were illustrated by Stroganov (1945) , who referred to this species as \"Parascaptor grandidens\": they appear to be very similar to those of P. leucura, but are considerably larger and the malleus has an expanded orbicular apophysis. The auditory region of the skull is similar too, except that the pneumatized region in Scaptochirus extends further rostrally into the alisphenoid (this study). The generic separation of Scaptochirus and Parascaptor is based on cranial, dental, and pelvic structure (Grulich, 1982) . Recent phylogenies place both within the Talpini clade, together with Talpa, Mogera, and Euroscaptor, but not as sister-groups (Grenyer and Purvis, 2003; Motokawa, 2004) .
