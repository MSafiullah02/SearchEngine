Under this circumstance, a database would contain a large number of designs which are according to specs (even if some may be of low performance) and a smaller number of designs which eventually violate pre-defined product requirements. By far, the resampling techniques have proven to be efficient in handling imbalanced benchmark datasets.

Currently, more than 90 SMOTE extensions have been published in scientific journals and conferences [6] . Most of review paper and application work are based on the \"classical\" resampling techniques and do not take new resampling techniques into account. In this paper, we briefly review six powerful oversampling approaches, including both \"classical\" ones (SMOTE, ADASYN, MWMOTE) and new ones (RACOG, wRACOG, RWO-Sampling) [2, 3, 5, 7, 24] . The six reviewed oversampling techniques can be divided into two groups according to whether they consider the overall minority class distribution. Among the six approaches, RACOG, wRACOG, and RWO-Sampling consider the overall minority class distribution while the other three not. Apart from developing new approaches to solve class-imbalance problem, various studies have pointed out that it is important to study the characteristics of the imbalanced dataset [13, 20] . In [13] , authors emphasize the importance to study the overlap between the two-class samples. In [20] , authors set up several experiments with the KEEL benchmark datasets [1] to study the relationship between various data complexity measures and the potential AUC value. It is also pointed out in [20] that the distinctive inner procedures of oversampling approaches are suitable for particular characteristics of data. Hence, apart from evaluate the efficiency for the six reviewed oversampling approaches, we also aim to investigate the relationship between data complexity measures and the choice of resampling techniques.",

The collected datasets are divided into 5 stratified folds (for cross-validation) and only the training set is oversampled, where the stratified fold is to ensure the imbalance ratio in the training set is consistent with the original dataset and only oversampling the training set is to avoid over-optimism problem [14] . The 19 collected datasets can be simply divided into 4 groups, ecoli, glass, vehicle and yeast (Table 2) . IR indicates the imbalance ratio, which is the ratio of the number of majority class samples to the number of minority class samples. In this paper, we aim to study the efficiency of different oversampling approaches and investigate the relationship between data complexity measures and the choice of oversampling techniques. Therefore, we need to calculate the 7 data complexity measures (shown in Table 1 ) for each dataset. In our 20 experiments for each dataset, we calculate the 7 data complexity measures for every training set (using R package ECoL [14] ). Since we use 5 stratified cross-validations, we average each data complexity measures for these 5 training sets and make it the data complexity measure for the dataset. In a binary classification problem, the confusion matrix (see Table 3 ) can provide intuitive classification results. In the class imbalance domain, it is widely admitted that Accuracy tends to give deceptive evaluation for the performance. Instead of Accuracy, the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) can be used to evaluate the performance [13] and can be computed as AU C = 1+T Prate\u2212F Prate 2 , where T P rate = T P T P +F N , F P rate = F P F P +T N . Apart from the AUC value, there are some other measures to assess the performance for imbalanced datasets, such as geometric mean (GM) and F-measure (FM) [13] . ",

We can observe that RACOG outperforms the other 5 oversampling techniques in 9 out of 19 datasets and MWMOTE is the 2nd best oversampling approaches. From our experimental results, we can conclude that, in most cases, oversampling approaches which consider the minority class distribution (RACOG, wRACOG and RWO-Sampling) perform better. It was expected that data complexity can provide some guidance for choosing the oversampling technique, however, from our experimental results, no obvious relationship between data complexity and the choice of oversampling approaches can be concluded. This is because the 6 introduced oversampling approaches are designed for common datasets and do not take a specific data characteristic into account. According to our experimental results, although the data complexity measures cannot provide guidance for choosing the oversampling approaches, we find there is a strong correlation between the potential best AUC (after oversample) and some of the data complexity measures. From Fig. 1 and Table 5 , it can be concluded that the potential best AUC value that can be achieved through oversampling techniques has an extreme negative correlation with the F1v value and linearity measures. In the imbalanced learning domain, there are many researchers focus on studying data complexity measures. In [14] , the authors propose that the potential best AUC value after resampling can be predicted through various data complexity measures. In [10] , the authors demonstrate that F1 value has an influence on the potential improvement brought by oversampling approaches. However, they did not consider the F1v measure, which has the strongest correlation with AUC value. Hence, we recommend using F1v to evaluate the overlap in imbalanced dataset. ",

In CAE applications, engineers often discretize the simulation domains using meshes (undirected graphs), i.e. a set of nodes (vertices), where the equations that describe the physical phenomena are solved, and edges connecting the nodes to form faces and volumes (elements), where the solution between nodes is approximated. The meshes are generated from an initial geometric representation, e.g. non-uniform rational B-Splines (NURBS) or stereolithography (STL) representations, using numerical algorithms, such as sweep-hull for Delaunay triangulation [23] , polycube [12] etc. In most cases the quality of the mesh plays an important role on the accuracy and fidelity of the results [9] . Engineers use different types of metrics to infer about the quality of the mesh, but it is common sense that increasing the number and uniformity of the elements in the mesh improves the accuracy of the simulation results. However, the computational effort associated with meshing is proportional to the target level of refinement. Therefore, a match between accuracy and available computational resources is often required, specially for cases that demand iterative geometric modifications, such as shape optimization.",

Such techniques avoid re-meshing the simulation domain, speeding up the optimization process. Several cases of optimization using morphing techniques are published in the literature [16] [17] [18] 22] . For our experiments, we implemented the free form deformation (FFD) method presented in [21] . The FFD embeds the geometry of interest in a uniform parallelepiped lattice, where a trivariate Bernstein polynomial maps the position of the control points of the lattice to the nodes of the mesh, as an IR 3 \u2192 IR 3 function. Therefore, by deforming the lattice, the nodes of the mesh are moved accordingly (Fig. 2) . The continuity of the surfaces is ensured by the mathematical formulation of the FFD up to the order of k \u2212 1, where k is the number of planes in the direction of interest, but the mesh quality is not necessarily maintained. The designer can either avoid models with ill-defined elements by applying constraints to the deformations, which might be unintuitive, or eliminate them by performing regular quality assessments. Addressing this issue, we propose the classification of the deformation parameters with respect to the quality of the output meshes, based on a data set of labeled meshes. Further than reducing the risk generating infeasible meshes for CAE applications, our approach avoids unnecessary computation to generate the deformed meshes, which is aligned with the objective of increasing the efficiency of shape optimization tasks.",

Therefore, combining our experimental results on both benchmark and real-world inspired datasets, we can conclude RACOG is the most powerful one of the considered 6 oversampling approaches. Moreover, we find that applying the oversampling techniques can improve the performance by around 10% for our digital vehicle datasets. We also calculate the data complexity measures for our digital vehicle datasets, our findings on the correlation between the potential AUC value and the data complexity measures remains consistent with the conclusion in Sect. 4.

The six reviewed oversampling approaches were performed on 19 benchmark imbalanced datasets and an imbalanced real-world inspired vehicle dataset to investigate their efficiency. Seven data complexity measures were considered in order to find the relationship between data complexity measures and the choice of resampling techniques. According to our experimental results, two main conclusions can be derived:",
