Although true, this framing fails to acknowledge that medical students have roles not only as learners, but also as clinicians-in-training. The primary role of medical students is to learn medicine. However, students are also clinicians who care for patients. They interview patients, call consults, respond to pages, communicate with families, write notes, assist with procedures, and help with care coordination and discharge planning.",

During the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918, medical students at the University of Pennsylvania cared for patients in the capacity of physicians (7). In a 1952 polio epidemic in Denmark, groups of medical students were tasked with manually ventilating patients (8). In the current pandemic, medical schools in the United States, Italy, and the United Kingdom are graduating medical students early on the condition that they serve as frontline clinicians (3, 9).",

In this article, we suggest several roles for medical students to play in offsetting the burdens caused by COVID-19.",

Medical students can boost the efficiency of lightly staffed clinics by taking histories, calling patients with laboratory test results, providing patient education, documenting visits, and fielding questions about COVID-19 (2). Even in a pandemic, patients with chronic conditions need ongoing care. Pregnant women need routine check-ins, and discharged patients require follow-up. Many of these tasks can be performed via telemedicine, so there would be no risk for infectious transmission.",

Under the supervision of senior residents or attending physicians, advanced medical students (\u201csubinterns\u201d) usually carry their own patients. In the absence of medical students, these patients would need to be covered by house officers, potentially exacerbating the personnel shortage about which the AAMC is concerned. Although this form of involvement would require appropriate PPE, staffing hospital services with upper-level students could maximize the availability of other clinicians to treat patients with COVID-19.",

However, students are also at increased risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2 while screening visitors entering hospitals, hosting PPE drives, and providing childcare for physicians, all of which they are already being deployed to do, and some of which require PPE (2). In addition, the risks incurred from student involvement may be lower than the risks to retired clinician volunteers, who are more susceptible to complications of COVID-19 owing to their age (10). However, given that the personal risks cannot be eliminated, we agree with the AAMC (5) that any in-person involvement of medical students should be voluntary.",

Although all of the roles we have discussed would require physician supervision, they would reduce the overall burden on clinical teams. We believe they would, on balance, improve patient care.",

In addition to the benefits to patients and the health care system, allowing students to participate reinforces important values, such as altruism, service in times of crisis, and solidarity with the profession.
