Case presentation: A 67-year-old man was admitted to our university hospital with dyspnea. Progressive respiratory failure developed leading to admission to the intensive care unit, intubation and prone positioning was necessary. To ensure adequate oxygenation and lung protective ventilation veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was established. Despite maximal therapy and adequate antiinfective therapy of all discovered pathogens the condition of the patient declined further and he deceased. Postmortem autopsy revealed Mucor and Aspergillus mycelium in multiple organs such as lung, heart and pancreas as the underlying cause of his deterioration and death. Conclusion: Routine screening re-evaluation of every infection is essential for adequate initiation and discontinuation of every antiinfective therapy. In cases with unexplained deterioration and unsuccessful sampling the possibility for diagnostic biopsies should be considered.",

In this patient the pattern of infection by Pneumocystis jiroveci, Staphylococcus aureus/MSSA, Candida dubliniensis, Cytomegalovirus and Legionella pneumophila reflecst the compromised immune function. The mortality of immunosuppressed patients suffering ARDS is increased [1] regardless of the severity of the disease. Polimicrobial infections are seen regularly in immunocompromised critically ill patients. Fungal coinfections were described in children [2] and adults suffering ARDS [3, 4] due to viral infections. Pneumocystis jiroveci is often found in immunocompromised patients [5] , as is the reactivation of Cytomegalovirus [6] .",

Due to respiratory insufficiency he required intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation and was therefore directly admitted to the ICU. The patient had a history of high-dose steroid therapy (dexamethasone 24 mg/day) for 5 weeks prior because of a spinal (suspected ependymoma presenting with spinal bleeding and paraplegia). His body temperature peaked at 40.4\u00b0C approximately 2 h after admittance to the ICU. Leukocyte counts were normal but C-reactive protein (CRP) and Procalcitonin (PCT) levels were elevated (CRP 45.05 mg/ml, PCT 5.59 ng/ml). Several blood and BAL samples were taken for microbiological diagnosis. Anti-infective therapy was started with Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Clarithromycin in accordance with the local standard. On the following day CT scan showed bipulmonary infiltrates and no signs of pulmonary embolism ( Fig. 1 ). At this point adequate ventilation required high driving pressures (paO 2 /FiO 2 77, pressure control ventilation, Pmax 32 mbar). Tidal volume goals were calculated with 6 ml/kg body weight. Prone positioning for about 19 h significantly improved the patient's oxygenation and ventilation settings (paO 2 /FiO 2 207, pressure control ventilation, Pmax 24 mbar). On the second day we received the first results from the bronchoalveolar lavage. PCR for Pneumocystis jiroveci, Legionella species and Cytomegalovirus was positive. PCT levels peaked at 63.02 ng/ml and CRP levels at 56.18 mg/ml while leukocyte counts were remaining within normal range. Anti-infective therapy was changed to Primaquine, Clindamycin, Ganciclovir and Levofloxacin. Results from Table 1 most common invasive fungal infections [7] with additional diagnostics and first line treatment [8] [9] [10] [11] In cases of septic shock extracorporal veno-arterial oxygenation is often limited due to higher heart time volumes in sepsis and developing harlequin phenomenon with insufficient systemic oxygenation. In these cases a veno-veno-arterial ECMO might be an option if the cardiac function is sufficient. After the start of veno-venous ECMO therapy, the patient stabilized slowly and the lactate levels decreased. There was no need for an additional arterial cannulation.",

This was primarily interpreted as a sign of disseminated intravascular coagulation but echocardiography was scheduled for the following day to rule out endocarditis and anticoagulation was switched from Heparin to Argatroban.

Risk factors for fungal infections in ICU-patients are numerous, including immunosuppressive drugs and the differentiation of contamination or infection in nonhematological patients is challenging. In this case the decision to deescalate and stop the therapy was based on the CT scan of the brain. The scan showed diffuse intracerebral hemorrhages with signs of increased intracranial pressure. The situation was evaluated and deemed to be infaust. With the knowledge of the autopsy findings, the overall situation of the mucor infection must now also be regarded as hopeless. Our initial discussion and decision to establish ECMO therapy was based upon the facts known at the time. Although the reported single cases about mucormycosis increased lately, they are rare. Most cases were described in patients with malignancies, organ transplantation, HIV or DM (recently reviewed in [12] ). Our patient was affected by none of these diseases but had received corticoid therapy and was therefore immunocrompromised.",

Therefore the onset of antifungal therapy is an important issue. Based on the expert opinion of the European Society of Anesthesia Intensive Care Scientific Subcommittee [15] the decision pathway in this case was correct. Initially the colonization index was < 0.5; candida score < 3. PCR-and Serum-tests were negative for fungal infection. 1,3-Beta-D-Glucan was not applied. However, the interpretation of this marker in patients infected by pneumocystis may be challenging [16] . The serological test (Platelia\u00ae; Bio Rad; M\u00fcnchen) did not prove positive Aspergillus-Galaktomannan-Antigen until 2 days before the patient's death. In addition diagnosis of pulmonary mucormycosis by conventional culture may be difficult due to overgrowth. Microscopical examination of BAL may lead to misinterpretation due to contamination. Histopathological examination may be a valid option, although it is of risk in patients with anticoagulation and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation [8, 17] . Recently Jiang and coworkers suggested the liquid-based cytopathology to identify mucorales promptly in samples obtained by bronchial brushes, which could be a less invasive method to detect this infection promptly [13] .",

Recent data suggests that T cells may play an important role in host defense to fungal disease [18, 19] .
