The scope of this review is restricted to applications of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and we have therefore made judgment calls regarding whether certain methodologies fall into this category. For example, we have included applications where authors have explicitly described the use of models such as neural networks and decision trees, while excluding applications based on simple linear regression models. Furthermore, we note that many of the articles cited are still preprints at the time of writing this review; given the fast-moving nature of the crisis we strove to be comprehensive in our coverage, but their full scientific rigor should still be assessed by the scientific community through peer-reviewed evaluation and other quality control mechanisms. For specificity, we signify all preprints with \u2020 . Finally, since this article assumes a certain background knowledge of both Machine Learning and the nature of the SARS-Cov-2 virus, we invite our readers to consult [2] \u2020 for further explanation regarding the potential of ML for scientific research, and [3] \u2020 for additional information about the virology, clinical features, and epidemiology of COVID-19.

With respect to the virus itself, four types of structural proteins are of interest: nucleocapsid proteins (N), envelope proteins (E), membrane proteins (M), and spike proteins (S) [7, 8] \u2020 . Also of interest are a number of non-structural proteins (NSPs), which are crucial for viral pathogenesis, including the 3-chymotrypsin-like (3C-like) protease (also known as 3CLPro, the main protease/MPro, or nsp5) and the papain-like protease (PLpro, part of nsp3). On the human side, research has focused on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, a receptor that facilitates the virus' entry into host cells [9] . Potential applications of AI on this scale include predicting the structure of these associated proteins, identifying existing drugs which may be effective in targeting these proteins, and proposing new chemical compounds for further testing as potential treatments [10] . residues as characterized by five different angles. This approach may allow for better performance by jointly learning features that are relevant to predicting both distance and orientation [18] . Heo and Feig refine trRosetta and AlphaFold's predicted structures using molecular dynamics simulations and compare the results with structure predictions from a third approach -C-I-TASSER [19] -which incorporates nine different methods for contact prediction. While the authors find that the predicted structures generally have much variability between them, there is some consensus for predicted structures of the papain-like protease, part of nsp4, and the M protein.",

[27] \u2020 also build a SARS-based homology model of the 3C-like protease, and apply their Mathematical Deep Learning (MathDL) approach to identify potential inhibitors for this protease. In particular, their model uses mathematical representations of molecules as inputs, and relies on two main datasets: information on 84 SARS coronavirus protease inhibitors from the ChEMBL database, and a more general set of 15,843 protein-ligand binding affinities from the PDBbind database. They fit two different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [28] on this dataset -a pooled (3DALL) CNN which is trained on both datasets together, and a multitask (3DMT) CNN which is trained on each dataset separately [29] . Using a consensus between these CNN models, the authors identify a list of 15 promising drug candidates from the DrugBank dataset.",

In a docking simulation, a wide range of candidate ligands interact with a protein in different orientations and conformations, generating a variety of poses (also known as the binding modes -i.e. the resulting interactions between the ligand and the protein as they bind). The poses are subsequently scored and used to predict the ligand's binding affinity. Since docking simulations are computationally expensive, some research has studied how to make the search more efficient by narrowing the pool of candidates which must be docked. For example, Ton et al. [34] develop a Deep Docking (DD) platform which trains a neural network to predict the outcomes of docking simulations, which they use to identify a set of 3 million candidate 3C-like protease inhibitors from a set of over 1 billion compounds extracted from the ZINC database. The authors then run a full docking simulation on the resulting compounds, presenting the top 1,000 results. On the other hand, Batra et al.

[36] use the LINCS dataset of gene expressions from cells targeted by various perturbagens (chemical or genetic reagents to treat cells and alter intracellular processes). They learn an embedding with a deep neural network classifier that predicts the perturbagen associated with each signature (i.e., the gene expression that is specifically correlated with a biological state of interest, such as therapeutic response). In order to correctly classify signatures associated with the same perturbagen, the learned embedding should abstract away from the noise in the input data and identify core features that are associated with a perturbagen's effect. Following this logic, their approach can utilize similarity in the learned embedding space to predict pharmacological similarities in structurally different compounds, and hence expand the horizon of drug repurposing. Avchaciov et al. [37] \u2020 adapt this approach to find drugs that produce gene expression signatures that are similar to the COBP2 gene knockout, which might limit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 based on the gene's role in the replication of the related SARS coronavirus. They list twenty of the most promising drugs, many of which have already been identified as antivirals; since these drugs have been authorized for clinical trials or already approved, the authors argue that their approach could facilitate the rapid discovery of potentially effective therapies.",

There is a subset of T-cells called memory cells which recognize the antigen of a formerly eliminated pathogen, and can quickly activate more effector T-cells upon re-exposure. These processes inform targets for vaccine design. As part of the response, helper proteins called major histocompatibility complex proteins (MHC I and MHC II proteins) present binding regions of antigens, called epitopes, for antibodies, B-cells, or T-cells to bind and attack. These MHC I and MHC II proteins are encoded by Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) gene complexes, which vary from person to person.

Upon identifying potential epitopes, the authors examine 68 different genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 to study how the virus mutates, and identify parts of the virus that are more or less prone to evolution.

[50] take another approach, in which they employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to nucleic acid sequences to classify whether they are associated with SARS-CoV-2 and therefore potentially improve the specificity of diagnosis. They contrast SARS-CoV-2 with other human coronaviruses from the 2019nCoVR repository, as well as other genome sequences with the ORF1ab protein from GenBank. The authors use a 21-base pair convolution over the whole genome (as opposed to previous approaches which only examine sequences of fixed length) and visualize the network's convolution and max-pooling layers to understand which particular sequences help to identify SARS-CoV-2. Using the 21-base-pair sequences retained after the max-pooling layer, they subsequently fit a classification model (e.g., logistic regression) for the same task, using feature selection to identify the most predictive sequences. They also apply this classification approach to distinguish between hospitalized and asymptomatic cases. Using just 12 21-base-pair sequences, the authors are able to identify SARS-CoV-2 with over 99% accuracy and classify asymptomatic cases with 85% accuracy. Although the data of the study was limited, this work highlights that opportunities lie in bioinformatic processes for researchers to improve existing diagnostic tools.",

Finally, Randhawa et al.

These approaches use different architectures such as Inception [66] , UNet++ [67] and ResNet [13] , which can be trained directly either on raw CT scans, or scans labeled with regions of interest identified by radiologists. Some studies also adopt a hybrid approach, combining off-the-shelf software with bespoke ML approaches in order to achieve higher accuracy. For example, in Gozes et al. [68] \u2020 , a commercial medical imaging program is used for initial image processing and then combined with an ML pipeline. The two-step ML approach consists of a U-Net architecture [69] trained on medical images of lung abnormalities in order to pinpoint lung regions of interest and a Resnet-50 [13] trained on ImagetNet [70] and fine-tuned on COVID-19 cases in order to classify the images as COVID-positive or healthy. The resulting architectures are able to extract relevant features from the images and identify COVID-19 pneumonia even in cases where there are several competing potential diagnoses, and can be deployed both at hospitals to help radiologists accelerate the analysis of new cases and shared on the Internet to enable rapid review of new images.",

This model then proposes segmentation of new CT scans, which can then be corrected by radiologists and fed back into the model, in an iterative process. This approach has enabled the development of a Deep Learning-based system for both automatic segmentation and the counting of infection regions, as well as assessing the severity of COVID-19, i.e. the percentage of infection in the whole lung. The authors show not only that the model improved its own performance incrementally, but also that the human time required for analysis of new images dropped from over 30 minutes initially to under 5 minutes after 200 annotated examples were used to train the model, reducing the effort required by radiologists to review a new scan.

It is important to know which factors can put patients at risk for hospitalization, developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death from respiratory failure. In this vein, there have been several recent papers that propose triage approaches based on features contained in patients' medical data and blood tests, in order to help clinicians identify high-risk patients and those at risk of later development of ARDS [87, 88] \u2020 , [89] . Using approaches such as the XGBoost algorithm [46] and Support Vector Machines [52] , these approaches aim to identify key measurable features to predict mortality risk, which can later be tested for in hospitals upon patient admission and during the hospital stay. Clinical indicators that were identified using these ML-driven approaches include lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) [88] \u2020 ; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), myalgias, and hemoglobin [89] ; and Interleukin-6, Systolic blood pressure and Monocyte ratio [87] \u2020 , although more research is needed to define specific thresholds and ranges of these indicators.",

Such approaches could help identify patients that might require intensive and long-term care, enabling hospitals to plan and manage their resources more effectively, as well as to monitor the state of patients and recognize when their condition worsens. A hybrid approach has also been proposed for this purpose, utilizing both CT findings as well as clinical features to predict the severity of COVID-19 [93] . The clinical features that were identified in this study, i.e. LDH and CRP, are similar to those identified in the purely clinical studies mentioned above; this overlap is promising for eventual clinical monitoring of these indicators. While these studies are limited both in scope and in data, they constitute important avenues of research that can be complemented and extended with clinical data from incoming cases around the world, thereby hopefully improving the prognosis of all patients and reducing the mortality of those that are critically ill.",

Using this data, along with prior daily statistics, the authors train an ElasticNet [107] model for forecasting future trends. Moreover, the authors investigate the transferability of their models between countries. This type of approach could be useful for probing the viability of training a model on data-rich countries and applying it to a data-poor ones, although the results of such a transferred model will have to be tailored for local contexts given that there may be different demographic characteristics and cultural norms.",

As in epidemiological models, the authors simulated the likelihood of an infodemic in which discussion of COVID-19 will grow exponentially, at least in its initial stages. Moreover, the authors examined the spread of misinformation (which they identify using external fact-checking organizations).

For example, Hu et al.[109] \u2020 have compiled a dataset of accumulated and new confirmed cases in 31 provinces and cities of China. After training a modified autoencoder (MAE) for real-time forecasting of new cases, the authors extract information from the autoencoder's latent variable layers to determine the model's most important features for each analyzed region. These features are then fed into a k-means clustering algorithm which groups similar regions for further analysis. This final step is designed to enable more efficient investigation of the regions showing infected/recovered characteristics of interest. Similarly, recent research has proposed training a Topological Autoencoder (TA), a simplified version of a Soft-supervised Topological Autoencoder[110], on the number of COVID-19 patients across 240 countries using data collected by the Center for Systems April 24, 2020 14/32",
