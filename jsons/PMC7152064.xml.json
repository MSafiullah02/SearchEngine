The loss of lung volume resulting from elevation of the diaphragm is only partially offset by the increase in chest wall diameter, and therefore functional residual capacity (FRC) is diminished by about 18%, or 300 to 500 mL.5 This reduction in FRC comprises an equal reduction in both the expiratory reserve volume and the residual volume.3, 5 The loss of FRC at term is made worse by recumbency, when diaphragm elevation is greatest because of the higher intra-abdominal pressure. Increased pulmonary blood volume in pregnancy may also serve to lower the FRC.6 This reduction in FRC is associated clinically with increased uptake and elimination of inhalational anesthetics and with rapid desaturation during hypopnea, as a result of the loss of the oxygen reservoir function of end-expiratory lung volume.7 Endotracheal intubation at term is thus substantially more hazardous than in nongravid patients.",

Budesonide is the best studied and hence preferred, although substantive safety data exist for beclomethasone as well. Alternative therapies include cromolyn, sustained-release theophylline, or a leukotriene antagonist.15 Frequent need for short-acting \u03b22-agonists should prompt institution of, or an increase in, the use of anti-inflammatory agents to treat, rather than to mask, a deteriorating clinical course. Long-acting \u03b2-agonists should only be used concurrently with long-acting inhaled corticosteroids.21 Finally, the addition of rapidly tapered courses of oral corticosteroids should be considered for those with acute severe asthma or patients with active symptoms who are already using inhaled steroids and \u03b2-agonists. Daily or alternate-day oral steroid administration (e.g., prednisone 40 mg/day) is sometimes required.15 Extensive practice algorithms have been made available by the NAEPP Working Group on Asthma and Pregnancy.15\n",

As in other community-acquired pneumonias, the causative agent is identified in only about half of the cases. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of pneumonia is frequently delayed because of reluctance to obtain a chest radiograph; a posteroanterior radiograph performed with a grid and a peak voltage of 90 to 120 kV exposes the mother to 5 to 30 mrad but the fetus to 100 times less, or about 300 \u00b5rad.48 A lateral chest radiograph produces greater maternal exposure (150 to 250 mrad) but is usually not required.48 The hazard to both fetus and mother of delaying the diagnosis greatly exceeds the risk of this small radiation dose. Antibacterial therapy is similar to treatment in the nonpregnant patient, although tetracyclines, quinolones, and metronidazole should be avoided if possible.48 Erythromycin, azithromycin, and \u03b2-lactam antibiotics are preferred because of their favorable safety profile (see Table 96-1).",

Because of this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends inactivated influenza vaccine in otherwise healthy women during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.50 Although influenza virus does cross the placenta, current opinion holds that it is not likely to be teratogenic to the fetus, despite isolated reports that link influenza with neural tube and other malformations.

Data are conflicting, and not all prospective studies have confirmed an increased incidence or mortality in pregnancy.48 Treatment with acyclovir does appear to reduce mortality in gravid patients and should be used as therapy for active disease.56 Use of varicella-zoster immune globulin (VariZIG) should be considered within 96 hours for susceptible pregnant women who have been exposed to varicella. Administration of VariZIG reduces but does not abolish risk for fetal infection or congenital varicella syndrome, and it is effective in preventing complications of varicella in the mother. Patients should be evaluated similarly to other adults, and a decision made to administer the immune globulin on the basis of immune status, type of exposure, and health status.

Stenotic valvular lesions are particularly poorly tolerated.66 Of these, mitral stenosis is the most common symptomatic valvular disease in pregnancy and frequently presents with pulmonary edema, not only during gestation but also immediately postpartum, because of the large shifts in intravascular volume associated with delivery. The gradient across a stenotic mitral valve is augmented by the increases in blood volume, cardiac output, and heart rate that take place during gestation and the puerperium. In aortic stenosis, the increase in cardiac output required for pregnancy worsens the gradient across the valve. As a compensatory mechanism, the left ventricular end-diastolic volume increases, but the low SVR impairs coronary artery filling during diastole and can precipitate ischemic syndromes. The reduction in SVR of pregnancy mitigates the consequences of mitral and aortic regurgitation and of the left-to-right intracardiac shunts of endocardial cushion defects but worsens the consequences of Eisenmenger syndrome and uncorrected tetralogy of Fallot. Depending on the cardiac disorder, perturbations induced by pregnancy can alter fractional shunts, induce hypoxemia, or precipitate pulmonary edema.",

A Danish population-based study of 63,000 deliveries found a cumulative incidence of 0.85 in 1000 deliveries from 1984 to 1994.74 In this study, the incidence of detected venous thromboembolism increased to 1.23 in 1000 deliveries after the introduction of ultrasonography, demonstrating that its reported incidence may depend on the adequacy of diagnostic procedures employed. Other studies have reported rates of 0.6 to 2 per 1000 pregnancies.75 The risk for thrombosis is increased in pregnancy, partly because of the increase in coagulation factors, particularly V, VIII, X, and von Willebrand factor antigen, and partly because of a marked fall in protein S.76 Venous stasis, an important contributor to thrombosis, is caused by uterine compression of the inferior vena cava and the left iliac vein. Local trauma to pelvic veins at the time of delivery probably accounts for the peak incidence of thromboembolism in the postpartum period, especially after cesarean section. Specific risk factors for thromboembolism include previous thromboembolism during pregnancy or while taking oral contraceptives, prolonged bed rest, a complicated or cesarean delivery, age, thrombophilia, obesity, and smoking. The inherited defects include deficiencies of antithrombin, protein S, protein C, factor V Leiden, and prothrombin G20210A.76 Antiphospholipid syndrome is an acquired thrombophilia. Previous thromboembolism or antithrombin deficiency warrant prophylactic heparin administration throughout pregnancy, now commonly accomplished with low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) due to their safety and decreased risk of heparin-induced osteopenia and thrombocytopenia.",

Both ventilation-perfusion scanning and computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography can be performed during pregnancy in a modified fashion. Estimated fetal radiation exposure for a perfusion scan is about 0.011 to 0.022 cGy (11 to 22 mrad), and simply halving the perfusion dose is standard practice in pregnancy, without greatly impairing resolution.78 There is no need for the ventilation portion of the study if perfusion is normal. CT pulmonary angiography is an acceptable imaging modality and is associated with similarly low radiation doses to the fetus (Fig. 96-4\n).78, 79 However, a risk to consider is the potential carcinogenic effect of radiation exposure to the mother's breasts,78, 80 although shielding can reduce exposure (see Fig. 96-4B). Pulmonary angiography, when performed by the brachial route, exposes the fetus to only about 0.050 cGy (50 mrad),81 but this procedure has a limited role in pregnancy. Such levels of exposure are not believed to cause teratogenicity, which is associated with exposure of greater than 5 to 10 cGy (5 to 10 rad). However, an increased incidence of childhood leukemia has been documented with lower fetal radiation exposure, in the range of 1 to 5 cGy (1 to 5 rad). A comparison of lung scintigraphy and pulmonary CT angiography concluded that the former method was more accurate than the latter for diagnosing pulmonary embolism during pregnancy.82 Ventilation-perfusion scanning in pregnancy, due to the patient's younger age and lack of comorbidity, is associated with a lower incidence of intermediate scans and higher rate of normal scans.83 CT angiography may more often be technically suboptimal, due to the increased cardiac output in pregnancy.84\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium contrast also has promise because it can image pelvic and lower extremity veins, as well as the pulmonary arteries, and it has little contrast-associated toxicity. Its widespread use will require increased availability of ultrafast scanners and more evaluation of its accuracy.",

The exact quantity or constituents of amniotic fluid required to initiate the syndrome is unknown. Pathologically, fetal squamous cells are found in the maternal pulmonary circulation at autopsy (Fig. 96-5\n) but, even in symptom-free patients, fetal cells may be aspirated from pulmonary artery catheters placed for other reasons.94 Hemodynamically, the process is often biphasic, with pulmonary hypertension initially, followed by left ventricular failure.95, 96 These changes may be caused by leukotrienes and arachidonic acid metabolites, particularly prostaglandin F2a, which appear in amniotic fluid during labor. An immunologic basis for some of the changes seems likely because women with male fetuses are more likely to acquire the disorder.90 Clark and associates93 seized on the similarities to anaphylaxis and suggested that the disorder be renamed anaphylactoid syndrome of pregnancy. A small study did not demonstrate evidence of mast cell degranulation but suggested a role for complement activation.97\n",

Increased intra-abdominal pressure due to the gravid uterus, the inhibitory effect of progesterone on the tone of the esophageal sphincter, and the assumption of the supine position for delivery all contribute. Eating during or just before labor increases the volume of emesis.103 Aspiration of gastric contents with pH 2.5 or lower is known to cause chemical pneumonitis and increased permeability edema. Both in Mendelson's original report and today, about two thirds of cases of aspiration take place in the delivery suite. Emergency endotracheal intubation of patients with obstetric crises is particularly difficult,104 and intubation in the delivery suite fails at a rate eight times that in the general surgical population.105 To minimize the chance of acid aspiration at intubation, oral administration of histamine-2 blockers with antacids before intubation,106 in conjunction with a formal airway assessment, is desirable. Identified risk factors in intubation include a high Mallampati class indicating poor visibility of the posterior pharynx, a short neck, protruding maxillary incisors, and a receding mandible.107\n",

It appears to account for about 2.8% to 5.6% of spontaneous pneumothoraces in women,123, 124 most often affecting women in the third or fourth decade of life. About 30% to 60% of cases are attributable to thoracic endometriosis, as judged by inspection at thoracotomy (Fig. 96-7\n)125; other cases have a more obscure etiology, however, so a number of theories have been advanced. The first theory is that, during menstruation, the absence of the normal cervical mucus plug permits an open connection between ambient air and the abdominal cavity through the uterus and fallopian tubes.124 Air can move transdiaphragmatically through right-sided diaphragmatic fenestrations into the pleural space, as it sometimes does during abdominal laparoscopy,126 accounting for the condition's right-sided predominance.124 A second theory is that high levels of prostaglandin F2a during menstruation cause bronchospasm with attendant air trapping and pneumothorax, but wheezing is not a common symptom of this disorder. A third theory is that pleural blebs or bullae are more susceptible to rupture during menstruation because of hormonal changes,124, 125 but visceral pleural leaks are rarely found at surgery (see also Chapter 81 for a full discussion).",

            "text": "Endometriosis probably affects about 10% of women, shows no clear ethnic differences in prevalence, and is most commonly diagnosed at 30 to 34 years of age.127 Although pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and infertility are its predominant manifestations, atypical locations, including diaphragmatic, pleural, and endobronchial sites, have been documented. As described previously, endometriosis can result in recurrent catamenial pneumothorax, which is its most common thoracic presentation (see Fig. 96-7). In one review of 110 cases with thoracic endometriosis, catamenial pneumothorax was the presenting symptom in 73% of cases, followed by hemothorax in 14% and hemoptysis in 7%.127 It also has been associated with right-sided pleural pain, pleuritic effusions, and hemothorax. Inspection at thoracotomy or thoracoscopy typically reveals blue-brown nodules on the pleural surface, sometimes in a \u201cgunshot\u201d distribution.128 The absence of known pelvic endometriosis does not exclude the diagnosis because only 20% to 70% of patients have associated pelvic disease. The diagnosis is suspected on clinical grounds because neither CT nor endoscopy is specific.129 Rarely, the endometriosis deposits are found in lung parenchyma, accounting for the catamenial hemoptysis. Most pleural and diaphragmatic disease is thought to arise from transdiaphragmatic spread from retrograde menses, even when abdominal disease is not evident. Massive ascites is sometimes related, although only 27 cases have been reported.130 Pneumothoraces may be attributed to cyclical sloughing of tissue on key surfaces, such as the visceral pleura,131 or to air trapping from airway involvement or compression.122 Pulmonary parenchymal disease may be embolic in origin, as is presumed to be in the case of central nervous system endometriosis. The diagnosis can be established only by biopsy showing the characteristic ectopic endometrial glands in involved sites. Medical therapy consists of progestational agents or gonadotropin-releasing hormones; surgical approaches include excision, local laser ablation, or pleurodesis.",

(See Chapter 69 for a complete discussion of LAM.) Involvement of pulmonary vascular structures is responsible for the hemoptysis, whereas lymphatic obstruction accounts for the chylous effusions. Mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphatic proliferation may be a feature of the disease as well. LAM is also associated with renal angiomyolipomas, another hamartomatous disorder, and with tuberous sclerosis. Conventional therapy has included oophorectomy or progestational agents, mainly medroxyprogesterone acetate. Lung transplantation has been performed in more than 60 patients with this disorder, but it has clearly recurred in some of them. Sirolimus, in a trial in patients with angiomyolipomas and tuberous sclerosis complex or LAM, showed ameliorative effects on lung function and volume of angiomyolipomas, presumably by suppressing signaling pathways involved in products of the defective genes.134 LAM is now included in the group of perivascular epithelioid cell tumors, whose molecular pathology is being elucidated, opening the possibility of targeted therapy.135\n",

Hypovolemic shock, renal failure, and ARDS may result. Pulmonary embolism and upper limb or superior venal caval thrombosis may result from the hypercoagulable state induced by estrogens and intravascular volume depletion. The mechanism of the effusions is unclear but is likely related to increased permeability due to release of vasoactive mediators, of which vascular endothelial growth factor appears to be the most important.139 Evidence points to mutations in the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor as etiologic in at least some cases.140 Treatment is supportive and involves maintaining intravascular volume, thoracentesis when required for respiratory compromise from abundant pleural effusion(s), and thromboprophylaxis.Key Points\n\u25aaNormal pregnancy is associated with profound alterations in respiratory and cardiovascular physiology, which\u2014although designed for maternal and fetal well-being\u2014may exacerbate underlying cardiopulmonary conditions or cause new ones.\u25aaMajor physiologic perturbations found in normal pregnancies include (1) an increase in central drive to breathe, with resulting changes in Pco\n2 (28 to 32 mm Hg) and pH (7.40 to 7.47); and (2) an increase in both maternal blood volume, of about 2 L (40%), and cardiac output, after 25 to 32 weeks of gestation, of 30% to 45%.\u25aaThe most common pulmonary disorder of pregnancy is asthma, but the effects of pregnancy on asthma are variable: it worsens, improves, or remains unchanged in roughly one third of afflicted women.\u25aaThe risks of poorly controlled asthma for both mother and fetus during pregnancy far outweigh the risks of drug therapy. Some standard drugs are safer than others (see Table 96-1) and should be selected whenever possible.\u25aaCystic fibrosis and infectious pneumonias have all been linked with adverse fetal and maternal outcomes, the risk of which depends largely on the severity of the complicating disorder. Prepregnancy counseling and avoidance of certain antimicrobial drugs (as noted in Table 96-1) are strongly recommended.\u25aaPulmonary edema may develop during pregnancy in women with underlying heart disease, especially valvular stenosis, cardiomyopathy, and preeclampsia. Because the causative mechanisms differ, so does specific therapy.\u25aaPulmonary embolism is a leading cause of maternal mortality. When indicated during pregnancy, low-molecular-weight heparins are safe for both treatment and prevention; warfarin is contraindicated. Ventilation-perfusion imaging, CT pulmonary angiography, and magnetic resonance imaging can be used as needed.\n\n",
