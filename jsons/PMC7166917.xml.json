            "text": "Eosinophils are able to induce unique inflammatory diseases in cats, including eosinophilic plaque, eosinophilic granuloma, feline indolent ulcer and hypereosinophilic syndrome. Feline gastrointestinal eosinophilic sclerosing fibroplasia (FGESF) is a newly recognised eosinophilic inflammatory disease in cats and is characterised by a firm palpable abdominal mass of the gastrointestinal tract and associated lymph nodes (Craig et al. 2009, Linton et al. 2015). Histological features of the mass lesions include dense collagen trabeculae, large fibroblasts and numerous eosinophils (Craig et al. 2009). Intralesional bacteria were detected in more than 50% of cats with FGESF (Craig et al. 2009, Weissman et al. 2013, Linton et al. 2015) and FGESF\u2010like lesions (Ozaki et al. 2003). Intralesional fungi were also reported in a cat with FGESF (Grau\u2010Roma et al. 2014). However, the role of bacterial or fungal infection in the development of FGESF remains to be determined. It has been thought that immunological dysregulation by an unknown cause may be implicated in the pathogenesis of FGESF (Linton et al. 2015). Prednisolone was shown to prolong the survival time of cats with FGESF (Craig et al. 2009). Based on these features of FGESF, the suggested treatment is multimodal \u2013 consisting of prednisolone, immunomodulatory agents and antibiotics after surgical resection of the mass (Linton et al. 2015). However, the efficacy of the therapy has not been reported in cats with FGESF.",

The cat had a history of lung abscess that was not completely resected by surgery approximately 2 years before the current presentation. Physical examination revealed mildly pale mucous membranes and abdominal distension. A complete blood count (CBC) exhibited an increase in the number of white blood cells (WBCs) of 33\u00b71 \u00d7 109 cells/L (reference interval, 5\u00b75 to 19\u00b75 \u00d7 109 cells/L), neutrophils of 27\u00b71 \u00d7 109 cells/L (2\u00b75 to 12\u00b75 \u00d7 109 cells/L) and eosinophils of 3\u00b73 \u00d7 109 cells/L (0 to 1\u00b75 \u00d7 109 cells/L) and moderate anaemia with red blood cells of 4\u00b77 \u00d7 1012/L (5\u00b70 to 10\u00b70 \u00d7 1012/L), haemoglobin of 70 g/L (80 to 150 g/L) and packed cell volume (PCV) of 19\u00b74% (24\u00b70 to 45\u00b70%). Serum biochemical analysis detected an increase in the level of total protein (TP) of 92 g/L (57 to 78 g/L). Thoracic radiography revealed pulmonary mineralisation associated with the previous lung abscess in the right middle and caudal lobes. Abdominal radiography demonstrated reduced contrast. An abdominal ultrasound illustrated mild ascites and hyperechoic mesentery, suggesting mesenteric peritonitis. CT also demonstrated mild ascites. Radiography, ultrasonography and CT did not detect any abdominal masses. Inspection of ascitic fluid revealed a specific gravity of 1\u00b7038 and TP of 56 g/L, indicating an exudate. The cytology of the ascites demonstrated inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils. Bacteria and fungi were not detected in the ascitic fluid using light microscopy. The antibody titre for feline coronavirus in the sera (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.) and the real\u2010time PCR analysis for the feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus in the ascites (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.) were negative, ruling out FIP infection.",

At laparotomy, multifocal small nodules were found in the mesentery (Fig 1A). The nodules were very firm. Gross inspection and palpation did not find any other lesions, including masses or lymphadenopathy. As it was impossible to surgically resect the multiple small nodules in the mesentery, excisional biopsies of a few nodules were performed for histological analysis (Fig 1B).",

After initiation of treatment with prednisolone and ciclosporin A, lethargy, anorexia and vomiting improved, and ascites diminished. Prednisolone was discontinued on day 44 due to the difficulty of oral administration. Ciclosporin A was administered without concurrent medicine until day 280, and it was then discontinued at the owner's request. The cat was in good condition during treatment with ciclosporin A and remained in good condition after discontinuation. A CBC examined on day 469 revealed that the numbers of WBCs (15\u00b79 \u00d7 109 cells/L) and eosinophils (0\u00b77 \u00d7 109 cells/L) had returned to within the reference intervals, although the number of neutrophils (14\u00b73 \u00d7 109 cells/L) was slightly above the upper reference boundary. The moderate anaemia found on day 1 was improved, with RBCs of 10\u00b70 \u00d7 1012/L, haemoglobin of 115 g/L and PCV of 32\u00b75%. The serum level of TP remained elevated (105 g/L).
