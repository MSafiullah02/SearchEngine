Instead, it is possible to observe virus\u2010infected cells by means of cellular alterations referred to as viral\u2010induced \u201ccytopathic effect\u201d (CPE).7 Cells often respond in different ways to viral infection. Several viral\u2010induced cytomorphological changes are listed in Table 1. It is important to mention that not all respiratory viruses induce morphological changes in cells of the lower respiratory tract. Characteristic CPE is often used to indicate the presence of inoculated viruses in tissue culture cells.",

For this purpose, the collection of lung samples is important to establish a diagnosis of VLRTI, especially in very ill patients where rapid detection is important and one cannot wait for culture results. Invasive procedures such as open lung biopsy may not always be necessary, as many viral infections can be diagnosed with exfoliative cytology. While viral CPE can be pathognomic, morphological overlap among these infections does exist (e.g., giant cell formation and multinucleation). When examining lung cytology samples, it is important to be cognizant of potential pitfalls including mimics, especially cancer, as well as the presence of concomitant infections in immunosuppressed persons. Finally, as the field evolves, it is imperative for researchers to report findings of potential CPE with emerging VLRTI such as Avian Influenza A and Middle East respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV).",
