Relevance will be determined by how well the returned posts answer the provided question. Through this task we will explore leveraging math notation together with text to improve the quality of retrieval results. This is one case of what we generically call math-aware information retrieval, in which the focus is on leveraging the ability to process mathematical notation to enhance, rather than to replace, other information retrieval techniques.

Techniques for answering one specific type of mathematical question, automated theorem proving, date back to 1956 when Newell and Simon [9] introduced the logic theorist that proved theorems in symbolic logic. Three years later, they introduced the General Problem Solver [10], which attempted to mimic students\u2019 behavior in discovering proofs. For math QA, an important recent development was the work of Ling et al. [6], who solved algebraic word problems by generating answer rationales and human-readable mathematical expressions that derive a final answer along with a description of the method used to solve the problem. Kushman et al. [5] presented an approach for automatically learning to solve algebra word problems expressed in text and math by defining a joint log-linear distribution over full systems of equations and aligning their variables and numbers to the problem text.",

One recent shared task that involved processing mathematical notation was Task 10 at SemEval 2019 [4], which provided a question set derived from the MathSAT (Scholastic Achievement Test) practice exams that included 2,778 training questions and 1,082 test questions from three major categories: Closed Algebra, Open Algebra and Geometry.

The NTCIR Mathematical Information Retrieval (MathIR) tasks developed evaluation methods and allowed participating teams to establish baselines for both \u201ctext + math\u201d queries and isolated formula retrieval. NTCIR-12 ultimately made use of two collections, one a set of arXiv papers from physics that is split into paragraph-sized documents, and the other a set of articles from English Wikipedia. Interest in these tasks is global; at the NTCIR-12 MathIR task, for example, there were participating groups from around the world, including Europe (Czech Republic, Germany), Asia (China, India, Japan) and North America (Canada, USA). The NTCIR-12 isolated formula retrieval test collection was also later used by participants for the 2016 Competition on Recognition of Online Handwritten Mathematical Expressions (CROHME) [8] at the International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR).",

For the QA task, at least 50 questions from MSE will be sampled, with the requirement that each question contains both text and at least one formula. Participants will have the option to run queries using only the text or math portions in each question, or to use both math and text. We will ask participants to label each run with which of these conditions they chose. One challenge inherent in this design is that the expressive power of text and formulas are sometimes complementary; so although all topics will include both text and formula(s), some may be better suited to text-based or math-based retrieval. We plan to accommodate this by reporting results for all participants that are averaged over three topic sets: (1) all topics, (2) topics for which the assessor believes the text alone to be an adequate characterization of the topic, and (3) topics for which the assessor believes the formula(s) alone to be an adequate characterization of the topic.",

We will perform this extraction centrally and distribute the extracted formulas as standoff annotations with references to the location of the formula in each XML question or answer post. Converting LaTeX to Presentation MathML is a straightforward transformation between formula appearance representations (i.e., symbols on writing lines). Producing Content MathML from LaTeX requires inference, and is thus potentially errorful. However, Content MathML supports a higher level of abstraction by representing operator structure explicitly. Centralizing this conversion will remove one possible source of variation, but conversion scripts will also be made available to participants who wish to experiment with extended conversion capabilities.\n",

Evaluation will be performed using a web-based system (e.g., Sepia5). Assessors for the main task will be asked to identify relevant answers using pools from the main task. Assessors for the formula retrieval task will work with merged pools from both the formula retrieval task and (where appropriate for the question) from the main task to identify similar formulas. Most pools will be judged by a single assessor, but some will be dual-assessed to observe annotator agreement. For the formula retrieval task, queries will be selected for dual annotation using stratified random sampling so as to cover a broad range of similarity types. We also plan for some limited experimentation with alternative annotation strategies (e.g., additionally annotating the most useful parts of a relevant answer, or annotating the preference order between relevant answers) with the goal of informing evaluation design in future years.",

We have chosen to focus on CQA, using Math Stack Exchange, both because that task models an actual employment scenario, and because the scale of the available collection is sufficient to also support the development of a second test collection more narrowly focused on formula retrieval. Math is, of course, only one example of structured notation, and we might reasonably hope to one day leverage similar ideas in other domains that also frequently use specialized notation, such as biology or chemistry.",
