Asymptomatic infections refer to the positive detection of nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but have no typical clinical symptoms or signs, and no apparent abnormalities in images, including lung computed tomography (CT).4 The clinical characteristics of asymptomatic infections and other types of COVID-19 are shown in Table 1\n. Early recognition of an infected person and cutting off the route of transmission are key points to control COVID-19. However, most asymptomatic infections do not seek medical assistance due to no obvious clinical signs and poor prevention awareness, which contribute to the rapid spread of COVID-19. Therefore, it is a great challenge to prevent and control this specific type of patient globally, which requires more attention worldwide.",

There are many studies on the incidence of asymptomatic infections (Table 2\n), but each study has its limitations. First of all, due to insufficient awareness of asymptomatic infections and limited detection capabilities in the early stage of the outbreak, China's 1.6% may be underestimated.8 On the contrary, another study investigated 565 Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan at the end of January and found that the incidence of asymptomatic infections was 30.8%.9 Another example is the \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d cruise ship, which was isolated in Japanese waters in early February due to COVID-19 infection found that the incidence of asymptomatic infections was 51.7%.10 Some researchers suggested that the above two studies overestimated the incidence, but in fact, a person truly has a higher risk if he has close contact with diagnosed or suspected infected persons in a relatively confined space. Incidence of asymptomatic infections from other studies had some shortcomings, such as those in Korea11 and Washington,12 which showed inaccurate results due to the small sample size. One case in Wuhan tracked the prevalence of 1391 children under 15 years old who had been in close contact with infected or suspected cases.13 The incidence of asymptomatic infections in the children is lower than that of the whole population, we propose that it is related to the special immune response and ACE2 level in the children's bodies.14 According to these studies, the ability of asymptomatic infections to spread the virus is not low, and these patients are likely to cause a new round of outbreaks. Therefore, finding asymptomatic infections is the key point for early prevention and control of COVID-19 worldwide.",

            "text": "The incubation period is the approximate time from the first exposure to the virus until the clinical symptoms or signs onset, and patients can also transmit the virus in this period.15 Asymptomatic infections have no special incubation due to no clinical signs. However, a recent research found that the viral load detected in asymptomatic populations were similar to that in symptomatic patients, indicating that asymptomatic infections have the potential for transmission, which may occur early in the course of infection.16 Since the viral nucleic acid positivity refers to that the virus load in samples reaches a certain limit, but the infectivity mainly depends on whether the virus is in a reproductive state.17 That is, sometimes, despite ongoing high viral loads, no live virus can be isolated, which means that viral nucleic acid positivity does not indicate infectivity.18 It is also proved by a clinical study in which the recovered COVID-19 patients who had no obvious clinical symptoms were detected to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 by hyper-sensitive viral nucleic acid re-examination methods, but these patients had not caused new infections.19 Due to the limited data from current studies, we think that it is necessary for us to be highly vigilant to asymptomatic infections. Moreover, viral nucleic acid positivity has been reported not to be always considered, and more clinical studies are still needed to verify that. A previous study found that the median period of asymptomatic patients from viral nucleic acid positive to negative was 9.5 days, the longest was up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases.20 Then in another study found that the median period from contact to diagnosis and the last positive nucleic acid test was 19 days (8\u201324 days) and 21.5 days (10\u201336 days), respectively.21 The median period from diagnosis to negative nucleic acid test was 7.5 days (2\u201320 days) with normal or atypical chest CT infections and 12.5 days (8\u201322 days) with typical CT findings.21 However, an asymptomatic infection should be quarantined for 14 days until now,22 more studies are still needed to assess the infectivity duration of asymptomatic cases. And if necessary, more attention should be paid to some special infectious individuals who need longer segregation due to the result of nucleic acid test.",

It has been reported that only a specific mild immune response is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 invasion in asymptomatic patients.28 However, more clinical samples should be collected, and a relative examination of ACE2 should be performed and compared for different types of COVID-19 cases, as this would be helpful to explain its pathogenesis.",

The successful isolation of live virus from throat swabs is a significant difference from SARS, suggesting that viral replication in upper respiratory tissues is active and that SARS-CoV-2 is more effective than SARS-CoV in spreading through active shedding of pharyngeal viruses.18 A German team found that some people with COVID-19 had high levels of virus in their throat swabs when their initial symptoms were mild, meaning that the pathogen was quickly released and transmitted to others by coughing or sneezing (droplet transmission).29 This means that protective measures, including wearing protective masks, can prevent infection with new coronavirus to a certain extent.",

More epidemiological methods, including close contact screening, cluster epidemic surveys, and follow-up surveys of the source of infection, were used to identify people with asymptomatic infections. The significance of asymptomatic infections as a source of infection depends on the distribution in the population and the amount and duration of virus elimination. However, clinical symptoms are hidden, and we can only rely on immunology or nucleic acid detection technology to obtain information about the infection; therefore, this kind of infectious source cannot be effectively identified, making it very difficult to prevent and control. Nucleic acid testing should be performed in persons who have contacted diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 patients. A person with an asymptomatic infection should be quarantined for 14 days.22 After the quarantine period expires, in principle, those who have negative test results for two consecutive samples of nucleic acid (sampling interval of at least 24 h) can be released from quarantine. If symptoms occurred during quarantine, the person should be admitted immediately. However, due to the limitations of specimen collection and detection methods, the influence of the high false-negative rate of the RT-PCR should be paid attention to, which may lead to missed diagnosis or delay in effective diagnosis.30 For this purpose, the combination of repeated nucleic acid detection and chest CT imaging examination should be effectively carried out for those highly suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections.31\n",
