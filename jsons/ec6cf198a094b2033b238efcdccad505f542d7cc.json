In humans, walking pneumonia usually is caused more specifically by M. pneumoniae(CDC, 2018). Other forms of bacteria can cause pneumonia, though, and should not be dismissed as irrelevant.For example, M. arginini can modulate inflammatory response and energy metabolism on the transcription level in B-lymphoid cells with HTT mutation (Krzyszto\u0144-Russjan et al., 2016). Additionally, M. arginini is particularly incriminated to be involved commensal bacteria found widely in association with mucous membranes of all mammalian species (Sykes, 2014) and can be isolated from normal human and animal respiratory mucosa (Thomas and Smith, 1972; Koshimizu and Ogata, 1974; Aroch et al., 2008; Gabinaitiene et al., 2011; Zhou and Li, 2014; Ericsson et al., 2016; Peek and Divers, 2017; Jambhekar et al., 2019; Maboni et al., 2019; Mead et al., 2019; Thomas et al., 2019). Several non-M. bovis species are of interest in cattle with varying degrees of clinical significance of which M. arginini comes to our interest (Parker et al., 2018). There is debate on whether these are truly new emerging pathogens or pre-existing pathogens that are now easier to detect due to the advent of sophisticated molecular diagnostic tools and more frequent diagnostic testing. For decades, the role of other bacterial agents such as M. arginini has been questioned (Yechouron et al., 1992; Watanabe et al., 2012). It is unknown whethercertain Mycoplasma species such as M. arginini act as a medical hazard. It is of significance to emphasize that, the 48 M. arginini isolates were from the pneumonic lungs and not from the healthy lungs. This was also encountered in other animals reflecting that most mycoplasmas are normal inhabitants of the upper respiratory tract but do not appear in the lungs of healthy animals(Thomas and Smith, 1972; Tan et   al., 1977a; Thomas et al., 2002; Aroch et al., 2008; Mohamed et al., 2018).With the work presented in this study, an arsenal of factors were implicated in the pathogenicity of M. arginini. The overlapping, but distinct effects of H 2 S, indicated that the bacteria possess a set of virulence determinants that synthesize and allow the bacteria getting efficient access to the host's resources.Gro\u00dfhennig et al.  (2016)  shared results confirming H 2 S production and hemolysis were correlated in M.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "Contrary to the assumptions based on the effects of catalase and catalase inhibitors on erythrocyte hemolysis by M. pneumoniae, Gro\u00dfhennig et al. (2016) also found that a mutant of M. pneumoniae, which was unable to produce H 2 O 2 , could still lyse erythrocytes in a blood agar overlay via \u03b2-hemolysis. The research conducted in this study concluded that catalase played only a minor role in hemolysis by M. arginini, similar to the property found in M. pneumoniae and that the discoloration of hemoglobin was specifically attributed to cysteine-dependent formation of H 2 S 2 ions. This data was also in accordance to the findings of Gro\u00dfhennig et al. (2016). On the other hand, the induced weak biofilm formation by M. arginini in this study could be attributed as a reflection to the weak production of catalase, which is considered as an enhancement factor for biofilm growth and formation (Simmons et al., 2015). The MAR indexes of the M. arginini isolates were decided based on eight different antibiotics. M. arginini demonstrated MAR index ranging from 0.0 and 0.625.Those isolates with a MAR indexes above 0.2 suggested that the bacteria isolates were from a high-risk source, where antibiotics were frequently used. Drug resistance in isolates originating from wildlife, which are not influenced by selective pressures of antimicrobial drugs, are believed to be low(Gufe et al., 2019). The values for all the strains between 0 and 0.625 suggested a diverse origin from a high-risk source of contamination where antibiotics are often used or encountered during transport from native countries (e.g. Sudan, Ethiopia and Chad) to Egypt.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "by sequence analysis,which allowed identification and discrimination of several Mycoplasma and Acholeplasma spp., including M. arginini, M. alkalescens, M. bovigenitalium, M. canadense, M. bovirhinis, M. californicum, A. laidlawii, and Acholeplasma oculi, when the Mycoplasma 16-23S rDNA and Acholeplasma 16-23S rDNA were targeted.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "isolate, and identify mycoplasmas from camels (C. dromedarius). To date, several non-M. bovis species are of interest in cattle with varying degrees of clinical significance, which was another factor reaffirming the importance of studying pathogens in M. arginini.This study employed an arsenal of factors implicated in pathogenicity of M.arginini to shed light on current knowledge gaps. By better understanding H 2 S and investigating other potential virulence factors found in this organism, more can be understood about M. arginini. Ultimately, the goal of this research and future research is to fully understand pathogens in possible hosts; this type of information can lead to novel, more effective treatment, control, and preventive measures and improve vaccine development.Author statementWalaa Mohammed Abdelazeem and Alaa Saad: Sampling collection, experimental implementation of the isolates and Investigation.

In order to establish sequence identity to GenBank accessions, a BLAST\u00ae analysis (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) was initially performed. Published data of international reference strains from the GenBank were available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=infectious+bursal+disease+virus). The comparisons of obtained nucleotide 326 sequences and multiple alignments were performed using the BioEdit sequence alignment editor (7.1.5) for multiple sequence alignment.Sequences were then submitted to NCBI GenBank using BankIt [see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/WebSub/?tool=genbank] under the accession numbers: MK271638 Mycoplasma arginini strain WA 1.Egypt, MK271639 Mycoplasma arginini strain WA 2.Egypt, MK271640 Mycoplasma arginini strain WA 4.Egypt, and MK271641 Mycoplasma arginini strain WA 5.Egypt.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "), this study isolated MK271639.1, MK271638.1, MK271640.1 and MK271641.1.
