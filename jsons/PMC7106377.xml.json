Transfusion of convalescent blood products may be considered for treating patients affected by emerging infectious agents when no other specific treatment is yet available and if the infection generates effective protective antibodies. Transfusing convalescent blood products has demonstrated some efficacy in fighting various viral or bacterial infectious diseases including influenza, measles, chickenpox, and, more recently, SARS and the HIN1 and H5N1 avian flu viruses [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Convalescent blood products are obtained by collecting blood (or plasma) from a donor, that preferably lives in the same geographically infected area, to account for potential mutations of the virus, and who has survived a previous infection by developing antibodies. Convalescent blood products are transfused to achieve passive immunization in recipients by neutralizing the pathogen, eventually leading to its eradication from the blood circulation.",

            "text": "EBOV, a member of the family Filoviridae, is the most recent example of an infectious outbreak that is now affecting West African countries. In the absence of a licensed therapeutic product yet, such as a vaccine or an antiviral treatment, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently approved in principle the evaluation, under certain conditions where controlled clinical studies would evaluate safety and efficacy [10] and in the absence of current alternatives, the use of convalescent \u201cserum\u201d as the first therapeutic option to treat patients with EBOV [10], [11], [12]. Part of this decision relied on historical data on the use of convalescent blood products against various infections and on a 1999 report which found that an infusion of convalescent whole blood was associated with the survival of seven of eight Ebola patients in the Democratic Republic of Congo [13]. In 1977, a (heat-treated) convalescent Ebola \u201cserum\u201d was infused, together with human interferon, into a research investigator who had accidentally been infected by EBOV [14]. Animal studies suggested the potential protective effect of anti-EBOV antibodies [15]. Individuals who have survived a previous infectious outbreak are possible donors of convalescent blood that potentially contains protective and long-lasting immunoglobulins (Igs). Serological cross-reactivity between various EBOV strains was found [16], which may potentially increase the number of potential donors to treat people affected with the recent outbreak. At this stage, the efficacy and safety of transfusing Ebola convalescent blood products have not been fully proven although it is suspected that it may help for the treatment. It was suggested that antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of filovirus infections may be a risk [17], [18], but the clinical relevance of ADE is controversial [19]. In this document, we attempt to clarify the types of convalescent blood products that can be considered to treat patients with EBOV and, more generally, other viral infections.",

Many reports lack important technical information on product preparation procedures, and the terms used may be misleading (e.g., the term \u201cserum\u201d may be employed in a generic way to designate other blood products). Use of convalescent \u201cwhole blood\u201d, or serum obtained by letting the blood clot, was reported against influenza [20] (see [8], [21]), mumps [9], Herpes zoster [22], poliomyelitis [23], typhoid fever [24], and measles [7], [25]. In some of those early clinical examples, whole blood was converted into serum by allowing it to clot, as described for treating measles patients, and injected by an intramuscular route [7]. Alternatively, serum was obtained by adding calcium chloride, and then pooling and sterile-filtering it [25]. A citrate anticoagulant may be added to blood, and then the plasma is recovered by decantation [7], not centrifugation. Use of convalescent \u201cdefibrinated plasma\u201d was described in cases of chickenpox [26].",

There is also a report on the administration of Lassa fever convalescent plasma (LFCP) to 27 hospitalized patients in Nigeria, with apparently increased efficacy in the outcome of the disease when plasma was infused early enough after the diagnosis [35]. Plasma can be obtained by centrifugation, or decantation, of whole blood or by apheresis.

In principle, use of a viral-inactivation process on convalescent plasma is preferable, if technically achievable, in case there are uncertainties with the possibility of residual viruses in the plasma. It, however, should not be a substitute to good donor screening and optimal viral testing. Licensed technologies include treatment with methylene blue/light [36], psoralen (S-59)/ultraviolet (UV) [37], and riboflavin/UV [38]. Readers can find detailed reviews addressing the technical characteristics, advantages, and limits of these technologies as applied to plasma for transfusions [1], [39], [40], [41]. All of them use a viral-inactivation process of photoinactivation in the presence of a photosensitizer. They require a dedicated bag treatment system and a specific proprietary illumination machine. Operators should receive appropriate training as needed for all such procedures. To our knowledge, there are no published data relative to the inactivation of EBOV using these technologies. Although these methods tend to induce some loss in the activity of coagulation factors, including factor VIII and fibrinogen, they are thought not to affect immunoglobulin functional activity.",

This pool size is obviously too large to be considered due to the difficulties to generate enough convalescent plasma. In some facilities, hyperimmune Igs are made from smaller pools (100\u20131000 L) of plasma from donors identified to have high titers of specific antibodies. Licensed hyperimmune IgG includes anti-HBV, anti-tetanus, anti-rabies, anti-cytomegalovirus, and anti-rhesus immunoglobulins. They are now typically made from donors who were immunized through routine vaccinations with licensed vaccines or controlled immunization protocols [57]. Hyperimmune IgG can also be experimentally produced from the plasma of donors immunized by natural infectious routes, as described for instance for malaria [58]. Commercial IgGs are made in good manufacturing practice-inspected facilities following licensed production methods. They are subject to at least two distinct viral-reduction steps [56]. IgGs made from convalescent plasma were experimentally prepared on a small scale to treat patients with SARS [30], [59]. Normal IVIG preparations made by the plasma fractionation industry may contain substantial levels of antibodies against infectious agents when collected from donors who happened to have been seroconverted during previous infectious outbreaks. Some commercial IVIG products may have high antibody titers against WNV [60], [61], HAV [62], measles [63], or Dengue virus when made from plasma collected from populations including donors who were naturally infected or vaccinated. Preparation of convalescent IgGs in a licensed facility would create specific, probably unsolvable, GMP (good manufacturing practices) issues considering the strict regulatory requirements to which plasma fractionators should adhere, particularly regarding the quality and safety of plasma for fractionation [57].",

Several products and diverse technologies can be considered for preparing convalescent blood or blood-derived therapies to fight EBOV and other emerging infectious agents. Whole blood and plasma may be the first and only options to consider before other approaches, provided they are prepared under ethical and controlled conditions. Production of safe convalescent blood products should rely, whenever possible, on a well-structured and well-coordinated national blood-collection organization which is not the case in currently affected countries in West-Africa [64]. This structure can serve as a technology platform when convalescent blood is collected \u2013 for safety considerations and to guarantee the traceability or because there is no other choice \u2013 under a distinct setting (e.g. remote health care centers). The efficacy and modality of clinical use of convalescent blood products should not be taken for granted. Controlled clinical evaluations are also, therefore, important to establish safe modality of treatment and to provide important knowledge for the treatment of future infectious outbreaks. Convalescent blood products should be prepared and used under strict controls and monitoring to ensure optimal safety to both donors and recipients. A recently published WHO Guidance document provides further technical information on the preparation of convalescent blood products [65].",
