Youth placed in foster care settings are also at a heightened risk for developing posttraumatic stress symptoms.4, 5 As a result, children in foster care are likewise more likely to experience mental and behavioral health needs, including concerns related to depression, anxiety, suicidality, risky sexual behavior, and delinquency.2, 6\u20138 Continued mental and behavioral problems also increase the risk for higher restrictive foster care placement5, 9 and contact with juvenile justice systems.10 Parents involved in the child welfare system themselves often have history with trauma and/or struggle with substance abuse, making child removal more likely11, 12; the experience of child removal can consequently influence parental mental health.13 With over 1.2 million children receiving services in the USA following maltreatment referral in 2015 alone14 and approximately 400,000 residing in foster care placement,15 the delivery and quality of behavioral and mental health care for children and families in this service setting are a priority and there has been a push in recent years to focus on the well-being of children within the foster care system.16",

Namely, caseworkers reported uncertainty about understanding the mental health needs of their clients, and therapists described difficulty addressing the complex client needs, exacerbated by multiple moves and varied family structures. Marcenko and colleagues in 2012 similarly identified that the multiple issues that child welfare-involved families face, including economic disadvantage, may impede their ability to participate in services with their providers.23 Others have also described challenges for child protection workers regarding client engagement and willingness to change.24, 25 Given that research has indicated challenges for other child welfare professionals, it is important to examine challenges experienced by TSPs serving a child welfare population.",

Initiation of this study first emanated from expressed concern by administrators in a community-based care agency about gaps in the confidence of TSPs working with families involved in the child welfare system. A university-community collaboration was formed in response as a means for bridging the gap between education, practice, and research with specific attention for the translational value of research in community-practice settings. Such partnerships are noted to promote an understanding of barriers to implementing evidence-based practice and are often fundamental to the advancement of implementation science.39 Questions guiding the study were broad and intentionally constructed without a priori hypotheses, reflective of the exploratory nature of this inquiry. IRB approval was obtained through the university board prior to its initiation and the study was conducted as part of a grant-funded project through a state institute.

One lamented:You are doing therapy with these people and, like, you want it to be the best that you can with them and plan for the session, individualize everybody, but you really can\u2019t. You have to kind of be like, \u2018okay, next, next, next.\u2019 And it is just, it is like a huge lack of \u2013 I mean for me that is a lack of quality. That really, really bothers me\u2026TSPs similarly expressed that productivity expectations do not account for the often high needs of a child welfare client population, and that trying to provide quality therapeutic services while still meeting required productivity hours is a challenge:If I have a client\u2026that is homeless\u2026my intention is to want to help that client to get resources\u2026But then your supervisor will flat out tell you, \u2018That\u2019s not your job description\u2019\u2026So if I spend time to do that for a client, then I\u2019m spending time taking away from other productivity\u2026then at the end of the month, I\u2019m going to get screwed for that.Another reiterated the influence of multiple client needs on therapeutic progress stating, \u201cI can\u2019t really do my best therapeutic work if you [the client] don\u2019t have child care, if you don\u2019t have diapers or your baby doesn\u2019t have formula\u201d, yet TSPs expressed feeling like they have to say a \u2018Sorry, I cannot help you. I cannot bill for that.\u201d Similarly, TSPs expressed the importance of accounting for high therapeutic client needs when setting quantity or productivity standards. One TSP suggested:If [a TSP] has four, five cases that are really high profile, like really draining, cut her some slack. Maybe she doesn\u2019t have to do 25 that time. You know. I mean, because they need to be focusing on the quality of work [the TSP] is providing to those clients.The second sub theme under unrealistic expectations was labeled \u2018personal and professional balance\u2019 and described a challenge in managing required workloads in the form of meeting requirements, negotiating logistics, and balancing professional and personal priorities. As summarized by one TSP, \u201cThere\u2019s just not enough hours in a day.\u201d Even TSPs who expressed understanding the importance of self-care voiced exasperation with the feasibility of keeping up with job demands: \u201cI don\u2019t have a family. I don\u2019t have kids. I consider myself very good at self-care\u2026I\u2019m a trained yoga instructor\u2026I coach people in self-care and it has, since starting this job, self-care has fallen to the wayside.\u201d",

Figure 1 also illustrates the ways in which themes were perceived to manifest across system, agency, and client levels, as described in the presentation of results. Specifically, some challenges at the system level were perceived to contribute to differential challenges at the agency and client levels and to likewise influence TSPs in multiple ways. As an example, unrealistic expectations were primarily expressed in relation to agency level structures, procedures, and policies, but system level challenges appeared to contribute to the complexity and magnitude of agency expectations. Intersecting and connecting lines in Figure 1 further reflect the presence of multiplex relationships among clients, the agency, and the larger child welfare system. Recognition of such intersection reinforces the cross-over effects described by TSPs. For example, navigating numerous involved parties creates hurtles in the form of interprofessional communication at the system level and differentially poses a challenge for TSPs by contributing to the creation of an overwhelmed and confused client population. Note that the use of solid lines highlights the client-worker relationship that is central to therapeutic intervention. The connection between these two individuals (i.e., the client and the TSP) is likewise distinguished in the context of larger entities represented by dotted lines (i.e., the agency and the system).
