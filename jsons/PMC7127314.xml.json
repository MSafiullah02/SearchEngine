For example, in the early 21st century, more than 8000 cases of SARS were reported, resulting in 774 deaths [1]. Infection transmission in hospitals for such highly infectious diseases is an important public health issue. Besides direct or indirect contact transmissions [2], respiratory infectious diseases can also be spread by airborne transmission of droplet nuclei over large distance. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) includes the use of administrative measures and engineering controls among its recommendations for reducing exposure risk in health care facilities [3]. Negative pressure isolation cubicles are usually built to accommodate patients in which a slightly negative pressure relative to the surrounding area may effectively prevent infectious agents from escaping out of isolation cubicles [3], [4]. Some design guidelines are widely accepted [3], [4]. US CDC guidelines and relevant international standards are in agreement with respect to requiring a ventilation rate of 12 air change rates per hour (ACH) [3], [4].",

To reduce the risk of infectious droplets and particles escaping into the corridor, an anteroom is commonly added to separate the cubicle and the corridor. With a higher pressure than the isolation cubicle and lower pressure than the corridor, the anteroom acts as an airlock. Tung et al. [6] reported that, if the isolation cubicle door is open and the air velocity through the doorway is less than 0.2 m/s, risk of droplet nuclei leakage into the anteroom is high. Small-scale experiments and theoretical models [7], [8] confirmed that the opening and closing motion of hinged doors can induce transient airflows and turbulence close to the doorway, followed by air exchange and the transport of airborne particles into the anteroom through the doorway. In addition, health care worker (HCW) movement is a significant factor in the spread of airborne pathogens and particles [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19].",

The technician waited an additional 3 min in the anteroom before entering the adjacent corridor. Subsequently, SF6 was readily detected in both the anteroom and the corridor, indicating tracer gas leakage into the anteroom and corridor during HCW movement. Johnson et al.

Poussou et al. [13] and Mazumdar et al. [14] numerically found that human-movement-induced wake may carry contaminant to positions far from the source location in an airplane cabin. For hospital isolation rooms with higher air change rates, some published studies verified that the velocity and pressure field were significantly affected by human motion and/or door motion [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. However there was only a small change in airborne transmission of airborne agents, and the risk quickly returned to its original level after the door was closed and HCW motion stoped [15], [16], [17]. Hang et al. [17] reported ventilation design and air change rates in a six-bed isolation room affected airborne transmission much more than human motion. Goldasteh [18] and Wang and Chow [19] found that human motion can significantly influence particle re-suspension and particle dispersion in the isolation room.",

            "text": "Most airborne transmissions are via dispersion of droplets/particles. Previous studies have confirmed that droplets/particles of different sizes are released from breathing, coughing, or sneezing and then undergo evaporative water loss in the air. There have been a number of studies on evaporation, dispersion and deposition of respiratory droplets as well as tracer gas dispersion in various indoor environments under different ventilation systems [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38]. Larger particles (diameter >20 \u03bcm) may rapidly deposit onto wall surfaces because the force of gravity is more significant than ventilation [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [37]; Smaller particles (0.5\u201310 \u03bcm) may remain suspended for a long time and contribute to disease transmission over greater distances, thus their transport process is similar with those of gaseous agents [24], [25], [26], [27], [37], [38]. Both fine particles and gaseous pathogens are significantly influenced by ventilation rates and airflow patterns [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38]. Yin et al. [38] experimentally studied an one-bed isolation room under the mixing or displacement ventilation system. They found that fine particles (diameter 1 \u03bcm and 3 \u03bcm) and tracer gas can generate similar contaminant distributions in most region of the ward, except in the areas close to the contaminant source and the exhaust adjacent to the restroom, where the flow may be unstable.",

Our objective was to confirm and quantify the mechanism of inter-cubicle airborne transmission induced by the hinged door motion and the duration of door opening. As a start, this paper first disregards HCW movement and only investigates inter-cubicle transport of tracer gas as a surrogate for very fine droplet nuclei. 2, 3 introduce full-scale experiments and CFD setups respectively. Section 4 presents results and discussions. Finally the conclusions are drawn in Section 5.",

In these experiments, tracer gas (SF6) was continuously released from the mouth of a thermal manikin in Cubicle 850A (named as Room 1, 'dirty room'). There was no tracer gas source in Cubicle 849 which is named as Room 2 ('clean room'). Each cubicle has its own toilet (Toilet 1 and 2) but uses a shared anteroom. Exhausts 1 and 2 are located in the ceiling of Toilets 1 and 2. The door in 'dirty' Room 1 is referred to as Door 1, and that in 'clean' Room 2 as Door 2. Each door is 1.2 m wide and 2.04 m tall (Fig. 1c). Above the two doors there are two air transfer grilles (Transfer grilles 1 and 2, see Fig. 1c) connecting two cubicles with the shared anteroom. There are downward supply diffusers in each cubicle, i.e. Supply 1 in Room 1, and Supply 2 in Room 2. In the anteroom, there is also a downward supply diffuser on the ceiling and an air transfer grille connected to the corridor (Transfer grille 0).",

Wind speed at two exhausts in Toilet 1 and 2 and Transfer grilles 1 and 2 was measured at nine points by using an air velocity meter (Model: TSI 8386A-M-GB), and an average air speed was obtained to estimate the air flow rate. Because the quality of such calculated flow rates is poor, this paper only uses the measured supply flow rates from the electronic balometer to calculate air change rates, which are 85 ACH, 27 ACH and 39 ACH for the anteroom, Room 1 and Room 2 respectively. These are much larger than the CDC specified value of 12 ACH [3], but such larger flow rates are commonly adopted in isolation wards of Hong Kong.",

The sweeping motion of Door 1, coupled with the flow from Transfer grille 0 produces a negative flow rate leaving the anteroom and entering Room 1 through the swept volume (Figs. 8a and 11). Secondly, the door motion produces a higher pressure in Room 1 than in the anteroom (Fig. 8b). The pressure is relatively low near the top and bottom of the doorway where considerable positive flow rate (Q(in) in Fig. 11a) is produced, and which is the main reason for contaminant flux entering the anteroom from Room 1 (Q\nc(+) in Fig. 11b). Vortexes are induced near the tip of Door 1 (Fig. 8a) which are also reported in the literature [7], [8]. In this period Door 2 is always closed, and contaminant flux through Transfer grille 2 (Fig. 11b) is small because little contaminant reaches Transfer grille 2 over such a short duration (3 s).",

The temperature difference between the anteroom and Room 1, combined with airflow from Transfer grille 0 and the entire ventilation system is the main cause of contaminant leakage. Since the net flow rate across the doorway of Door 1 is about \u22120.2112 m3/s in Case [34, 10 s] and its cross area is 2.444 m2, the average velocity is only \u22120.08 m/s, which is not sufficient to prevent contaminant leakage out of Room 1 when Door 1 remains fully open (0.2 m/s required by Tung et al. [6]). Contaminants mainly enter the anteroom through the top of Door 1 and Transfer grille 1 (Fig. 11b). Chen et al. [44] reported similar findings in a hospital ward consisting of four cubicles with 'positive pressure' towards their shared corridor. If the door is open, the slightly higher temperature in the corridor compared with the cubicles does induce two-way air exchange and contaminant transport across the doorway from one source cubicle into the corridor, and subsequently into the other 'clean' cubicles. A good technique is to install curtains at the doorway [45] which can reduce the area of the doorway and thus increase this average velocity through it. Over this period (3 s < t < 13 s), as displayed in Fig. 11b, the net contaminant fluxes across the Door 1 doorway is positive (i.e. entering the anteroom and leaving Room 1), meanwhile there is an increasing negative contaminant flux through Transfer grille2 (i.e. leaving the anteroom and entering Room 2).",

With a scale physical model, Fontana and Quintino [46] experimentally confirmed that door operation can produce a dirty air transfer in the clean room, and that transfer entity appears strongly related to air volume displaced in the door opening operation but almost independent from differential pressure and flow rate imbalance. However, our simulation results show that the amount of airborne agents transferred into the clean anteroom depend on not only the transient two-way airflow induced by door motion but also the unsteady concentration gradient across the doorway. Thus the transport of airborne agents across the doorway into the clean anteroom and to the neighbor cubicle is a much more complicated and transient process than the scaled model in the literature [46]. Further investigations with various speed of door sweeping motion (for example 3 s, 2 s, 1 s) are still required to check how the speed of door motion influences inter-cubicle transmission in such realistic hospital wards.",

As displayed in Table 4, <C>1(0) is 50.55 ppm if 8.5 ACH is used for each cubicle, which is much greater than 13.47 ppm for 34 ACH. In Case [8.5, 10 s] and Case [8.5, 30 s], <C>max in the anteroom is 4.75 ppm at 16.3 s and 8.64 ppm at 33.8 s, that in Room 2 is 0.76 ppm at 265 s and 1.62 ppm at 256.0 s. The comparisons with 34 ACH verify that, if reducing the air change rate of each cubicle from 34 ACH to 8.5 ACH, <C> in Room 1 rises about 3.5 times, <C>max in the anteroom increases about 3\u20135 times and that in Room 2 increases about 2\u20133 times. More time is also required to reach the peak concentration in the anteroom and room 2, as well as to remove contaminant leaked into the anteroom and Room 2. Thus the amount of inter-cubicle transmission and exposure time in Room 2 increases greatly if air change rate decreases.",

Throughout the door opening and closing motion, the door sweeping effect in combination with the ventilation system dominates two-way airflow and contaminant exchange. When the dirty cubicle door remains fully open for a while, the average air velocity through the doorway is small and the temperature difference across this doorway is the main cause of two-way contaminant exchange and inter-cubicle transmission.",

Keeping the door completely open possibly contributes to the major fraction of inter-cubicle transmission when the duration time (30 s, 60 s) is much longer than the door sweeping processes (only 3 s). Air change rate is another important parameter. If the air change rate for each cubicle decreases from 34 ACH to 8.5 ACH, more infectious agents enter the anteroom and the clean cubicle, meanwhile it requires more time to reach their peak concentration and to remove the leaked airborne pathogens once the dirty cubicle door is closed.",

Considering that the negative pressure in isolation cubicles is sufficient to prevent inter-cubicle airborne transmission if wind speed across the doorway is sufficiently high [6], it is recommended that curtains can be installed at doorway locations to reduce the risk of airborne pathogen leakage [45]. Other techniques are also plausible, such as using air cleaners [47], using facemasks [48], etc. Although further investigations are still required with respect to particles and droplets simulations, this paper offers meaningful findings for the inter-cubicle transmission of gaseous agents when a shared anteroom is used.",
