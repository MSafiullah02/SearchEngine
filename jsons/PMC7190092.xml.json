The Maonan families are generally small and monogamous, with the same surnames, and are from the same clans usually living together in small villages with only a few households. The biggest village consists of not more than 100 households. The major staples of the Maonans are rice and maize, followed by millet, sweet potatoes and pumpkins. The language of the Maonan people belongs to the Dong\u2010Shui branch of the Zhuang\u2010Dong language group of the Chinese\u2010Tibetan language family. Most members of the tribe inhabit the area around the Maonan Mountain of Huangjiang Country in the Guangxi Province of the Zhuang Autonomous Region in Southern China (Figure 1). The three districts of Shangnan, Zoungnang and Xianan have been referred to as \u2018San Nan Shan Xiang\u2019 since early times, which means \u2018Maonan village in a mountain valley\u2019. The Maonan people call themselves \u2018Anan\u2019, meaning \u2018indigenous people\u2019, which suggests that they are indigenous to the area. According to historical evidence, the Maonan people have descended from the ancient tribes of the \u2018Baiyue\u2019 and \u2018Liao\u2019 and that the Maonan tribe formed by amalgamating with some other population (1).",

Approximately 1700 alleles in the regions containing HLA classes I and II have been identified around the world.
