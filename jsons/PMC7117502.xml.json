Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), the aetiological agent, is a virulent feline coronavirus (FCoV) biotype that demonstrates enhanced and sustained replication in cells of the monocyte lineage, and is responsible for triggering and perpetuating the immune mediated pathology seen in FIP (Kipar et al., 2005). Immune modulating drugs have been the mainstay of treatment for affected cats, however such treatments when examined in controlled trials, have provided little if any benefit (Fischer et al., 2011, Ritz et al., 2007). Direct acting antiviral therapy for FIP has received considerably less clinical attention.",

We have previously demonstrated effective in vitro inhibition of FIPV using synthetic siRNAs targeted against sequences encoding structural and non-structural proteins and the 5\u2032 UTR (McDonagh et al., 2011). One of the major challenges facing the development of antiviral therapeutics is resistance, which may develop during treatment, or be pre-existing in a virus population. Whilst this is a concern with any antiviral compound, it is particularly problematic for RNAi based approaches due to the exquisite sequence specificity of the targeting mechanism. A single nucleotide mismatch within the target site can dramatically reduce the efficacy of RNAi-based viral inhibition by impairing base pairing between the guide strand and its target (Gitlin et al., 2005). This is especially relevant for feline coronaviruses, which are known to exist as a quasispecies (Kiss et al., 1999).",

Whilst theoretically each additional antiviral added to a treatment regimen will further reduce the likelihood of resistance occurring during treatment, this must be balanced against the potential for increased toxicity or antagonistic effects. For RNAi-based therapeutics, each additional siRNA will compete for access to the RISC machinery, and thus combination therapy with multiple siRNAs may result in highly potent siRNAs being diluted by the presence of less potent molecules (Bitko et al., 2005, Castanotto et al., 2007). Similarly, competition for incorporation into RISC between siRNAs and endogenous microRNAs may increase the risk of off-target effects.

In the current study, despite targeting conserved regions, selection pressure due to siRNA treatment resulted in the generation of two unique mutations for L2 and three unique mutations for N1. Further large scale screening for escape sequences would be required to determine whether the mutations identified in the current small scale study represent the most likely route of viral escape, and also whether such an approach is practical for these targets based on the overall number of escape sequences possible. Recent studies using this approach with HIV have shown that although viral escape via mutations targeted by the second generation of siRNAs are inhibited, selection pressure results in the development of resistance via alternate routes (Schopman et al., 2010).",

Chemically synthesised siRNAs are traditionally designed to mimic this structure, with a central 19 nucleotide duplex complementary to the target sequence, and with the overhangs commonly deoxythymidines. In the search for improved efficacy and reduced off-target effects, a range of non-classical siRNA structural variants have been investigated, some of which appear to offer advantages over the canonical \u201c19 + 2\u201d structure (Chang et al., 2007, Kim et al., 2005, Rose et al., 2005, Salomon et al., 2010). One of these, a 27 nt duplex referred to as a Dicer-substrate siRNA, was shown by Kim et al. (2005) to be 10\u2013100 times more potent than its sequence matched canonical siRNA, without inducing interferon or protein kinase R responses and having an enhanced duration of action. Further refinement of the originally blunt-ended 27-mer duplex resulted in the DsiRNA structure used in the current study: a 25 nucleotide sense strand in which the two 3\u2032 terminal nucleotides are replaced with DNA, and a 27 nt antisense strand hybridised to give a blunt ended sense 3\u2032 terminus and 2 nt overhang at the sense 5\u2032 terminus (Amarzguioui et al., 2006). Asymmetry and the incorporation of DNA bases into the DsiRNA structure results in the preferential incorporation of the antisense strand into RISC, improved complex formation with proteins known to be important for RNAi, as well as minimising the activation of the innate immune response (Amarzguioui et al., 2006, Snead et al., 2013). Not all published data however supports the contention that Dicer-substrate siRNAs offer any advantage over the canonical siRNAs on which they are based. Foster et al. (2012) compared the performance of DsiRNA and siRNA against a range of targets and found no class effect, with both canonical and Dicer-substrate siRNAs comparable in terms of potency and duration of activity, both in vitro and in vivo. Dicer-substrate siRNA were also reported to be less tolerant of chemical modifications and more immunostimulatory, however in regards to antiviral therapy, the latter may actually be a desirable feature (Stewart et al., 2011).",

For monotherapy against target L2, and combination treatment for L2 and N1, DsiRNA were more potent, while there was little difference between siRNA and DsiRNA for monotherapy targeted at N1. Increased potency was greatest for combination therapy, with the IC50 of dual combination DsiRNA almost 10-fold lower than that for dual siRNA therapy. The duration of action appeared related to the potency of the molecule, with increased potency resulting in increased duration of activity. Previous studies investigating the duration of activity of canonical versus Dicer-substrate siRNAs have targeted cellular genes. In these cases the cessation of silencing is thought to be related to a reduction of intracellular siRNA due to the activity of ribonucleases or through a dilution effect caused by cell division (Takahashi et al., 2012). In the current study the apparent cessation of antiviral effect may also be due to the emergence of resistant isolates or through a simple overwhelming of the RNAi machinery, as cells are exposed to progressively higher MOI as viral replication proceeds. Both of these hypotheses fit with the experimental data showing that prolonged duration of activity correlated with increased potency.",

The prevalence of type II FCoV varies worldwide, however in all reported studies infection with type I viruses is more common (Pedersen, 2009). It is unlikely that the higher prevalence of type I infections would invalidate any therapeutic application of the siRNAs tested in this study, as the primary difference between type I and II FCoVs is the spike protein, a region not targeted by any of the tested siRNAs. Furthermore, siRNAs were selected based on homology to reported strains, including both type I and type II FCoVs, and subsequent alignment of siRNA targets against the most recently published sequences confirmed a high degree of conservation among both types.",
