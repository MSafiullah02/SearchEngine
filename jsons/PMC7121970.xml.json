Each piece of the full PPE ensemble will have limitations that must be understood by the wearer. Close and careful attention to behaviors in the patient care environment becomes good PPE etiquette. Donning, or putting on PPE, carefully and fully before attending to a patient\u2019s needs is fundamental but not intuitive. Doffing, or removing PPE, is a high-risk procedure that can be performed safely with practice, coaching, and observation. Mitigating risk depends on awareness to all areas of potential contamination and a mindful approach to delivering safe patient care.",

Staff may need to practice methods of glove removal that discourage contamination, whether a glove-in-glove or other method is utilized. Fluorescing solutions and UV flashlights make this an easy exercise and one that is key to good technique. Studies have demonstrated an increased safety to staff with double gloving, but most of these determinations were made when the threat to the staff was from substances such as bone cements and glues [2]. Double gloving by itself does not prevent contamination of the wearer from either poor technique or from unrecognized loss of glove integrity [14]. Balancing the need for increased protection with required tactile sensation is not easy. Staff will need practice performing required skills while in extra layers of gloves. Because the cuffs of gowns and suits are not required to be fluid impervious, it is important that gloves extend over that portion completely and may require the use of an extended cuff glove [11]. Some institutions have chosen to use longer and heartier sterile gloves as their outer layer, while others have opted for extended cuff length exam gloves designed for chemotherapy use to offer a similar level of protection. Triple gloving is another option, which provides an additional glove which can be exchanged during patient care activities.",
