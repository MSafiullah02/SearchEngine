Recent publications have described these gaps in surveillance, recognizing the barrier of timely diagnostic testing and the need for the increased use of multiplexing molecular assays to enhance the sensitivity of respiratory virus detection [2, 3].",

Sibu Hospital is a referral hospital for central Sarawak, with a bed capacity of 730, serving six other smaller district hospitals and a population of more than 725,400 in the central region of Borneo Island. A nearby district hospital, Kapit Hospital, while smaller, also sees a relatively large number of pneumonia admissions (approximately 300) per year considering the small rural population of 130,800 it serves. Kapit is located 120 kilometers south-east of Sibu, currently accessible only by boat. Kapit Hospital is a government hospital with 134 beds that serves as the referral hospital for several smaller towns along the Rajang River [13].

For the purpose of this analysis, three suspect-positive RSV-A samples, which were run a second time for validation and revealed consistent amplification curves, were considered positive. Thus, 39 samples were positive for RSV-A (30.2%), two were positive for RSV-B (1.6%), one was positive for PIV-3 (0.8%) and one was positive for PIV-4 (0.8%). No samples tested positive for PIV-1 or PIV-2. Due to low prevalence, RSV-B and PIV1-4 outcomes were not included in risk factor modeling.",

The detection of RSV A is in keeping with the finding that globally, RSV group A tends to be more prevalent than RSV group B [22]. We found that RSV subtype A led to more hospitalizations than RSV B; however, there are mixed findings as to the clinical significance of the different genotype infections [6, 22, 23].",

Our findings demonstrate RSV season may begin earlier than July, though data from an ongoing pneumonia study will provide a snapshot of year-long data on the seasonality of RSV in Sarawak, in addition to influenza viruses, adenoviruses, coronaviruses and enteroviruses. Because data collection occurred in June and July, the two months following the Gawai celebration in Sarawak, it is possible that community gatherings might have contributed to the increased prevalence of RSV infection. This would be especially true in Kapit, which is a smaller and more isolated town that attracts nonresident travelers during the Gawai celebration. The population of Kapit is largely made up of ethnic groups that reside in traditional or modern longhouses, with rows of private single-family units running perpendicular to a hall of public, communal space. Of the RSV-A patients in our study, 60% reported residing in households with six or more cohabitants; however, while the questionnaire captured household size, it failed to capture household type (longhouse versus single-family home).",
