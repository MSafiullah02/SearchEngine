            "text": "Viral diarrhoea seriously endangers the pig industry throughout the world and is characterized by acute diarrhoea, vomiting, dehydration and high mortality in neonatal piglets, resulting in enormous economic losses. The most common and traditional causative agents responsible for diarrhoea in pigs are porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and group A porcine rotavirus (PRV\u2010A). In particular, PEDV variant strains with extremely high virulence to piglets emerged in the pig population in China in 2011 (Li et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2012) and then were reported in other Asian countries, the Americas and the European Union in the following years. In addition, several other swine enteric viruses have been reported. Porcine kobuvirus (PKV), a picornavirus, was first identified from pig faecal samples in Hungary in 2008 and then reported in China in 2009 (Reuter, Kecskemeti, & Pankovics, 2010; Yu et al., 2009). PKV was subsequently reported in many other countries, such as Thailand, Korea, Japan and the United States (Khamrin et al., 2010, 2009; Park et al., 2010; Verma, Mor, Abdel\u2010Glil, & Goyal, 2013). Porcine sapovirus (PSaV), a calicivirus, was first reported in the United States and in the United Kingdom (Knowles, 1983; Saif, Bohl, Theil, Cross, & House, 1980) and is now circulating in wide geographical regions, including the America, Europe and Asia. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), a newly emerged swine enteric virus, was first discovered in healthy pig herds by a research team in Hong Kong in 2012 after performing a molecular epidemiological investigation among 3,137 mammals and 3,519 birds (Woo et al., 2012). Two years later, PDCoV was reported to cause severe diarrhoea and/or vomiting and atrophic enteritis in pigs in the United States and China (Song et al., 2015).",

            "text": "These swine enteric viruses cause similar clinical symptoms in infected pigs, leading to difficulties in diagnosing diarrhoea. Although several standard detection methods, for example virus isolation, virus neutralization tests, and indirect immunofluorescence assay, are available for the detection of viruses, these techniques are time\u2010consuming and not suitable for detecting large\u2010scale samples. Currently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods for the detection of these viruses have been reported (Luo et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2016; Zhu, Wang, Cui, & Cui, 2016). Due to the high pathogenicity of these viruses to suckling piglets, which have immature immune systems and few antibodies, ELISA is inefficient for detecting these viruses compared to PCR. Regarding available PCR methods for the detection of swine enteric viruses, none of them can differentially detect these six viruses in one assay.",

Next, the cDNAs and primer sets of PSaV or PKV were added to the triplex assay, and the results demonstrated that all these target genes were well amplified without any interference (Figure 2b). Based on these results, both PSaV\u2010 and PKV\u2010related reagents were combined with a triplex reaction system, which resulted in a multiplex assay that was able to detect TGEV, PEDV, PRV\u2010A, PSaV and PKV simultaneously (Figure 2b).

In addition, dual infections, for example, PDCoV + PSaV, PDCoV + PRV\u2010A, PRA\u2010V + PSaV, and PEDV + PDCoV and triple infections, for example, PDCoV + PRV\u2010A + PSaV, and PEDV + PDCoV + PKV, were detected at a relatively high frequency in the collected samples (Table 2), implying that coinfections of swine enteric viruses widely existed in pig farms in China.",

The pathogenesis of TGEV, PEDV and PRV\u2010A has been extensively characterized (Pensaert & Martelli, 2016; Vlasova, Amimo, & Saif, 2017). However, several novel viruses have been found in the faeces of pigs, such as PDCoV, PKV and PSaV. In 2017, another novel swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV) was discovered in Southern China (Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017). The aetiology of swine enteric viruses has become increasingly complicated, and the similarity of clinical signs in pigs infected with these viruses makes it difficult to determine the causative agents. Due to the lack of valid detection methods, these viruses have not been included in the lists of the differential diagnoses for swine veterinarians. A simple, rapid, efficient and high\u2010throughput detection method is urgently needed for the differential detection of swine enteric viruses.",

Song et al. also did not find TGEV\u2010positive samples from 356 samples of diarrhoeal specimens collected in Jiangxi Province between 2012 and 2015 (Song et al., 2015). However, Wang et al. reported an 18.5% positive rate of TGEV from 27 intestinal samples collected from four provinces of Northwest China between September 2015 and May 2016 (Wang, Ji, Zhang, Xu, & Zhang, 2018). The main reasons responsible for this difference might be the varied geographic distributions of this virus or different sample types. Using nanoparticle\u2010assisted polymerase chain reaction, Zhu et al. found a 3.5% positive rate of TGEV infection in 114 samples from four provinces of China (Zhu et al., 2017). Investigations from Zhao et al. revealed that the TGEV infection rate was as low as 1.91% in East, Northeast and Southeast China between 2012 and 2014 (Zhao et al., 2016). Taken together, TGEV is not a prevalent or dominant pathogen accounting for swine viral diarrhoea in China in recent years.",

Importantly, some of these viruses are always detected spontaneously from the same specimen, indicating that coinfection is a common phenomenon in some pig farms. Our results showed that dual or triple infections between PEDV, PDCoV, PRV\u2010A, PKV and PSaV commonly existed in Chinese pig herds. Zhao et al. also reported the coinfection of PKV with PEDV, TGEV and PRV\u2010A in China (Zhao et al., 2016). Using next\u2010generation sequencing or nanopore sequencing technologies, Chen et al. and Theuns et al. reported that coinfections of swine enteric viruses were widely presented in pig farms in the United States and Belgium (Chen et al., 2018; Theuns et al., 2018).",

First, coinfections may speed up the evolution of individual viruses and coevolution between coinfected viruses. Meanwhile, recombination between coinfected viruses may also occur. New swine enteric coronaviruses were generated by recombination with PEDV and TGEV and spread across central Eastern European countries during 2012 and 2016 (Akimkin et al., 2016; Belsham et al., 2016; Boniotti et al., 2016). Recombination might create more virulent enteric virus strains or new viruses, leading to potential outbreaks or pandemics of swine viral diarrhoea. Additionally, coinfections may promote the evolution of non\u2010pathogenic enteric viruses into high virulent and pathogenic viruses. A recent example showed the existence of PDCoV in pig herds for many years in mainland China and Hong Kong; however, the virus had no observable clinical symptoms (Pan et al., 2017; Woo et al., 2012). Unfortunately, this virus caused severe outbreaks in some states of the United States since 2014 (Ma et al., 2015; L. Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014). This virulence change was most likely caused by previous exposure to PEDV or other coinfected swine enteric viruses.",
