Addressing our interest in the synthesis of more complex peptidomimetic structures, the selective removal of the Boc protecting group results in a crucial step for obtaining a new functionalization site. Classic acidic conditions are not suitable for Boc removal, due to the presence of labile functional groups. The use of BF3\u00b7Et2O17 gave free aziridines, but in low yields. Finally, the deprotection reaction was successfully carried out using TBAF/THF18 and the deprotected 2-cyano aziridinyl peptides 3 were obtained in the yields as reported in\nTable 2, after purification by flash chromatography.",
