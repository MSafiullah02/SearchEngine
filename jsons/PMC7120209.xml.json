            "text": "\n\nActive ; this is a system of surveillance that provides the most accurate and well-timed information .It involves individual staff that regularly contact members of the community and collect information regarding health conditions from the communities and/or healthcare providers (Nsubuga et al. 2006). Active surveillance involves close watch and observation of health conditions, including disease occurrence, deaths and any conditions that are out of the ordinary looking for patterns and linking them to outcomes. Active surveillance requires time and resources. It involves community health workers, working within the communities, supervisors collecting information, managers\u2019 supervising and coordinating the process, epidemiologists interpreting the information and healthcare workers in the clinics and hospitals that handle and identify cases. Active surveillance is expensive and is a challenge for most developing countries with limited resources. Active surveillance is essential in early detection of epidemics as an early warning and can be used in epidemic response.\nPassive ; this is the type of surveillance which depends on reports from health institutions including hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and any health units (Nsubuga et al. 2006). This type of surveillance involves filling in forms by healthcare workers and these forms are collected and the data is analysed. Passive surveillance is relatively inexpensive hence it is widely used. This system of surveillance covers large areas and provides information that can assist in determining the health of communities. Routine health information system which involves regular reports on diseases occurring in health institutions by public health staff and health information management system are also part of passive surveillance (Nsubuga et al. 2006).\nCategorical ; this type of surveillance is focussed on, for example a particular disease or groups of diseases, a particular health condition or a behaviour. It can be active or passive form of surveillance but is very involving as health care workers have to fill in more than one form making it tedious and adding more work. It might not be as efficient at the community and district level (Nsubuga et al. 2006).\nIntegrated ; this system gathers information on multiple diseases, using both active and passive systems. This surveillance system integrates the categorical disease programmes thereby improving the timelines on data collection as well as data completion. For example, gathering information on infectious diseases through registers kept at hospitals or clinics and or individual staff collecting information in communities (Nsubuga et al. 2006, 2010).\nSyndromic ; an active and passive system that uses case definitions as well as clinical features as data type. This type of surveillance was the first kind in developing countries where resources are scarce. One would be able to record symptoms that could indicate cases such as diarrhoea, fever, headaches and so on. The challenge of this system is that it is highly unspecific; therefore the common symptoms could mask an underlying emerging disease. Since it does not require laboratory confirmation, syndromic surveillance is fast and inexpensive and easy to adapt in a developing country setting (Nsubuga et al. 2006).\nBehavioural risk factor ; involves surveys that measure behaviours that are known to cause disease, e.g. smoking, alcohol use, risky sexual behaviour and practices and more (Nsubuga et al. 2006). This is achieved through active repeated surveys.\n",

If surveillance was carried out and data was collected, the answer would lie in the data. Possibilities include, the surrounding environment, a disease associated with the geographical disposition of the area, could be certain pathogens or toxins that are associated with vegetation in the village or human behaviour associated with the initial village. If surveillance data existed, trends and behavioural patterns could be established that would assist in solving the mystery.

There is need to invest in national surveillance systems that are sustainable, cost effective and inclusive so that the wide population benefits from it. Collaboration of national health surveillance programmes between neighbouring countries and regions could help in infectious disease surveillance. Although there are surveillance networks that have been set up in developed countries, most developing countries are often lagging behind due to lack of resources to support infrastructure and technology required to meet a quality surveillance system. Even though these poor developing countries carry the burden of emerging and neglected infectious diseases that affect billions of people, most are lacking in surveillance. Poor surveillance in developing countries presents a risk of spread of infectious diseases even to countries that have well established surveillance systems. The 2015, Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the SARS and MERS outbreak in Asia are examples of how infectious diseases can easily cross borders and infect people from different backgrounds, and races. It is therefore important that developing countries are able to build surveillance systems that can detect epidemics at an early stage and be able to put in place the necessary steps to prevent further spread of infectious diseases.",

This is a problem shared by most poor developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa as well as other low-income countries globally. Births and deaths that occur in remote villages are rarely reported to civil and health authorities resulting in inaccurate figures. This information is poorly documented and can only be accessed through word of mouth from the community leaders who are the authority and overseers in communities. The lack of written records makes it difficult to follow up and prove facts. With poor records, it is difficult to develop and follow trends on diseases that frequently occur in these communities. Apart from the common malaria and diarrhoea, it is very difficult to track any other infectious and non-infectious diseases that may occur in the communities if the patients do not visit the hospital or health centre. These include sexually transmitted diseases, parasitic skin diseases, measles, cholera and other emerging diseases that may occur exclusively in a particular area. With the health authorities unaware of these occurrences, it is very difficult to control the spread of these infectious diseases. Even if the health authorities try to get information from the community leaders, usually the verbal autopsy (explanation on the cause of death) is so simplified like, \u201cMr. A died of a headache and Mr. B died of stomach pain\u201d. The causes of death being outlined are more or less symptoms of other underlying diseases that could have been the possible causes of death.",

Senegal, Mali, Nigeria and the Gambia have the laboratory facilities that allowed for rapid testing of Ebola samples as well as surveillance systems that allowed for efficient contact tracing of cases. Their neighbours were completely overwhelmed by the outbreak and lacked the facilities and efficient contact tracing. If there was better collaboration and or partnerships between these countries regarding case testing as well as surveillance, maybe the picture could have been different. Second, if there was collaboration in surveillance as well as contact tracing between the countries, the infected personnel who had contact with the initial cases in Guinea, could not have been allowed to cross borders, there would have been no possibility of repatriating infected bodies from one country to another as was the case when two bodies of individuals who had died from Ebola in Guinea were repatriated to Sierra Leone (WHO|One year into the Ebola epidemic: a deadly, tenacious and unforgiving virus, n.d.). This repatriation put at risk everyone who handled the bodies during the repatriation process including the vehicles used for transport. This was a risk that could have been avoided if there was collaboration between countries in disease prevention and control. Despite the availability of International Health Regulations by WHO, which focus on public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC), the response from WHO and international community were quite contrary. Finally, developing countries where infectious diseases are rampant lack resources to establish good surveillance systems; developed countries who are working to prevent diseases have better and well advanced surveillance systems. It is in this regard that developing countries have to work together to combat these challenges which can be better understood by the affected countries. Response from the international community during the 2014 Ebola outbreak was slow and this allowed for further spread of the virus, as the affected countries were overwhelmed by the shock. This calls for efforts from developing countries to set out strategies to combat similar outbreaks in the future. These strategies include: developing capacity in disease surveillance, community awareness and involvement, and improve the healthcare systems as well as develop infrastructure to improve the health and livelihoods of their populations.",

Ample consultation of these communities is required in order to identify effective ways of combating infectious diseases.",
