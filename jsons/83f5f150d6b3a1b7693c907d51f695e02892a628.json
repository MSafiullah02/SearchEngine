Although the role of IgA in mucosal immunoprotection is well established, other isotype immunoglobulins such as IgG and IgM may also participate in mucosal protection [2] . Mucosally associated IgG has also been recently suggested to contribute to host defense based on evidence indicating that mucosal IgG Abs may act by neutralizing toxins, adhesins or viruses and by inhibiting the penetration of viruses across the epithelial layer [3] . Indeed, mucosal IgG induced by systemic immunization (e.g. with polysaccharide antigens from Haemophilus influenzae) or passive systemic administration of specific IgG antibodies (e.g. against simian immunodeficiency virus) provides excellent protection against pathogens encountered on mucosal routes (respiratory or vaginal mucosa, respectively [1] . Likewise, within the lumen, IgG Abs can exert a protective function against HIV [4] . Moreover, IgG and IgM mucosal immunity to influenza in an IgA knockout mouse model has also been reported [5] .",

Interestingly, we have observed that Cry1Ac preferentially induces high specific IgG responses in intestinal fluid when it is intraperitoneally administered to mice; therefore, in the present study, we used this protocol, as a model to address the influence of systemic immunization on the induction of the intestinal IgG response. The data shown indicate that upon intraperitoneal immunization with Cry1Ac, significant intestinal specific IgG cell responses were produced in the lamina propria, accompanied by an increased frequency of intestinal IgG+ lymphocytes and epithelial cells containing IgG. Considering that FcRn is the receptor responsible for the transport of IgG in neonatal intestinal epithelia, but it is developmentally downregulated in the rodent intestine, we analysed whether upon intestinal IgG induction, FcRn mRNA expression was induced in intestinal epithelial cells, of adult mice. Whereas in intestinal epithelia of unimmunized adult mice FcRn mRNA was not detected, in Cry1Ac immunized mice it was expressed, although the level was lower in comparison with that found in neonatal epithelia. Then using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence we confirmed that the expression of the protein FcRn was induced in the intestines of adult immunized mice especially in the large intestine. Finally, we found that Cry1Ac also increased FcRn expression in isolated intestinal epithelial cells stimulated in vitro. The outcomes suggest that the expression of FcRn in intestinal epithelium might be reactivated upon immunization, and possibly facilitate IgG transport.",

            "text": "to host defense, as well as the mechanisms by which IgG reaches luminal secretions and its function in these locations are not entirely known. The neonatal Fc receptor for IgG (FcRn) is the receptor responsible for mediating IgG transport across epithelial barriers. In addition, FcRn binds IgG and albumin in a pH-dependent manner and protects these from catabolism by diverting them from a degradative fate in lysosomes, through its expression on endothelia and potentially other cell types [7, 8] . Besides, FcRn can also enhance IgG-mediated antigen uptake across mucosal epithelia [9] . In mice and rats, FcRn is expressed at high levels in the intestinal epithelial cells of suckling pups where it is responsible for the transport of IgG present in maternal milk across epithelial cells and into the digestive circulation of the newborn animals; but, it is developmentally downregulated in the rodent intestine-as is highly expressed at birth, although a dramatic decrease in its expression within the epithelium (approximately 1000fold) occurs at the time of weaning (approximately 14 days of age), at the time of epithelial closure and, simultaneously, with the cessation of IgG transport [7, 10] . Although this phenomenon accounts for the ascription of 'neonatal' for this particular Fc receptor, it has recently been appreciated that FcRn continues to be expressed during adult life in humans, pigs, cows, monkeys and even rodents [11] [12] [13] [14] . Indeed, human FcRn continues to be expressed in numerous adult human cell types including intestinal, kidney and bronchial epithelial cells [12, 15, 16] . The fact that FcRn is not expressed in the intestinal epithelia of adult mice suggests that intestinal IgG transport in adult rodents is not mediated by this receptor; however, it has not been explored whether FcRn is expressed in intestinal epithelia upon intestinal IgG induction.",

Insecticidal proteinaceous crystals named Cry proteins are produced as protoxins by Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) during sporulation. Upon ingestion, crystalline protoxins are solubilized and proteolytically activated by midgut proteases of susceptible insects. The activated toxin, which is not toxic to vertebrates, binds to specific receptors on the brush-border membrane surface of the insects' midgut epithelium, inducing formation of pores and eventually leading to insect mortality [17] . In particular, Cry1Ac is a pore-forming protein that is specifically toxic to lepidopteran insect larvae by binding to the cell-surface receptor aminopeptidase N in Manduca sexta midgut via the sugar N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) [18, 19] .",

Secretory IgA (sIgA) is well-known to be transported across epithelial cells into the lumen through an active unidirectional receptor-mediated process known as transcytosis by the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) [6] . Conversely, the mechanisms by which IgG reaches the luminal intestinal secretions in adult mice are not entirely established. IgG is Figure 7 Flow cytometry analysis of the intestinal epithelial cells expressing FcRn from control and immunized adult mice. Cells were analysed within the epithelial gate and E-cadherin was used an epithelial cell marker.

Based on the relative proportions of the IgG subclasses as well as the ratio of specific versus total IgG detected in external secretions and plasma, it has been assumed that the presence of IgG antibodies in external mucosal secretions is originated exclusively or predominantly from the circulation through transudation [33, 34] . However, a few studies have shown evidence suggesting that the source of IgG found in secretions might arise from local mucosal production. For example, it has been demonstrated that the specificity of IgG Abs in secretions may differ from that of their serum counterparts and vary depending on the mucosal compartment [35] . Moreover, female genital tract secretions contain a significant proportion of IgG, which seems to be locally produced by abundant IgGproducing cells [33] . Likewise, present results indicate that in the intestinal lamina propria of the small and large intestine, of Cry1Ac immunized mice are induced significant specific IgG-producing cell responses. Although the number of IgG-producing cells was not higher than those producing other isotypes, they appear to produce a greater amount of antibody.",

Thus, we considered important to determine if the immunization provoked intestinal inflammation as well as to evaluate the presence of intestinal IgG+ lymphocytes by immunohistochemistry.

However, it has not been examined before whether FcRn was expressed in intestinal epithelia upon intestinal IgG induction. Importantly, present results indicate that the expression of this receptor can be reactivated to some extent in adult mice.

However, when the effect of stimulation with Cry1Ac was tested in vitro in isolated epithelial intestinal cells, we found an increase on FcRn expression (after 24 h), suggesting that the protein might also exerts direct effects in intestinal mammalian epithelial cells, perhaps throughout an unknown receptor as has been previously suggested. Indeed, despite Cry proteins are not toxic for vertebrates and Cry1Ac toxin is known to form pores exclusively in lepidopteran insect larvae midgut epithelial cells, it has been shown that Cry1Ac protoxin binds to brush border membranes vesicles prepared from mouse small intestine in vitro, and induces a transient hyperpolarization of the jejunum [41] .

This study topic is important since like IgA, mucosally associated IgG has been shown to contribute importantly to mucosal host defense [3, 9] . Indeed some reports have also shown that passive administration of neutralizing IgGs can prevent mucosal human immunodeficiency virus transmission in rhesus macaques or macaque neonates [3] . Likewise, virus-specific IgG in vaginal secretions of immune mice significantly reduces infection of the vaginal epithelium by challenge with herpes simplex virus type 2, whereas S-IgA contributes relatively little to this protection. Moreover, it has been proposed that FcRn regulates mucosal IgG immune responses to luminal bacteria, as selective expression of FcRn in the epithelium, (using a transgenic mice model expressing FcRn beyond the neonatal period of life), was shown to be associated with secretion of IgG into the lumen that allows for defense against an epithelium-associated pathogen (Citrobacter rodentium) [9] .",
