            "text": "In 1346, the Mongol army that was laying siege to the Crimean city of Kaffa hurled the corpses of plague victims over the city walls, an event that likely seeded the epidemic that infected the besieged city. The disease subsequently spread across Europe as the Black Death, killing 24 million people in the next six years [1], [2]. Though by no means the first example of biological warfare, this event is an illustrative example of the power of even crude biological weapons. It was not until the 20th century, though, that advances in microbiology spurred widespread research into the production and weaponization of biological threat agents. The biological arms race that took off during World War II and escalated with Cold War tensions was thankfully tempered by the United Nation's 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), which prohibited the development, production, and stockpiling of bioweapons and their delivery systems [1], [2], [3], [4]. Since then, the threat of biowarfare has largely been supplanted by that of bioterrorism, which profits from the \u2018horror factor\u2019 and the low financial cost/casualty ratio associated with bioagents [5]. Examples such as the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States, which led to 22 cases of confirmed anthrax, five deaths, and required prophylactic antibiotics for 10,000 people, underscore the need for vigilance and the urgency behind the development of superior sensors and monitoring techniques for weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats [1], [2].",

Moreover, the need to detect members of this diverse group with specificity, sensitivity, and rapidity augments an already substantial challenge. Traditional detection methods, which include assays based on biochemical and immunological recognition, biomolecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or cell culture, often require ample time (hours to days), leaving a clinician to essentially guess as to the identity of the pathogen or toxin. For environmental monitoring purposes and the initiation of containment and prophylactic treatment of exposed individuals, these techniques leave significant room for improvement.",

In addition to the properties unique to nanoscale materials, the disposability and small size of NMs make them well-suited to application in portable and multiplexed sensors. Relying on intrinsic NM properties in conjunction with immunogenic or other biological recognition mechanisms, detection schemes exploiting colorimetric, photoluminescence (PL), electrochemical, plasmon resonance, and other responses have been explored [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Here we examine a range of bioagents and the nanoscale sensors that have been recently developed to detect them. Building on the foundation laid by an earlier review from this group that focused on the devices under development for bio-threat agent detection, we examine the most novel and innovative ways in which NMs are being applied to this problem [15]. Many of the techniques highlighted are research-based prototypes not yet ready for integration into commercial devices, but they already offer promise when compared to the current \u2018gold standards\u2019 for detection and highlight areas in which nanosensors are able to outperform the traditional detection paradigms. Rather than an exhaustive review of these sensors, our focus is on highlighting select NMs and how they have been applied to detecting biothreat agents.",

Modern biological warfare began during World War I when German agents infected animals shipped from the United States and other neutral countries to Allied Forces with anthrax and glanders [4]. The diseases caused by bacteria, however, have long histories; Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, has been proposed as a possible cause of the fifth and sixth plagues mentioned in Exodus. Likewise, Plague (caused by Yersinia pestis) played a substantial role both in natural epidemics (e.g., the Black Death) and in bioweapons programs in the 20th century. Interestingly, Y. pestis still sees occasional outbreaks in the American Southwest, typically originating from small mammal and rodent vectors, although modern antibiotics have significantly reduced mortality [17]. The diversity of bacteria is reflected in the range of diseases they cause, infectious doses, etc. For example, while the mortality rate of untreated inhalation anthrax is greater than 90%, the mortality rate of brucellosis, caused by one of six Brucella species, is 2\u20135%. Paradoxically, as few as 10 organisms are required to cause brucellosis, however, while an infectious dose of B. anthracis is 10,000 spores.",

Both qualify as emerging infectious diseases, defined as diseases that have increased in incidence in the past twenty years or show signs of a likely increase in the near future [22], [23], [24]. While some bacterial species fall into the category of emerging diseases (e.g., multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis), viruses have assumed a higher public profile in recent years as outbreaks threaten to turn into pandemics.

Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), among the best-researched bioagents, is the most lethal toxin known. A protein toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, causative agent of botulism, its LD50 (lethal dose to 50% of the sample population) is a mere 0.1 \u03bcg/70 kg intravenously. A thousand-fold less toxic, ricin is a protein found in the seeds of the castor bean plant and has a history of use in assassinations and murders, such as the Bulgarian secret police's 1978 assassination of Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov, in which a ricin pellet likely obtained from the KGB was injected into his leg by a \u2018pedestrian\u2019 agent using a modified umbrella. A third protein toxin, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), produced by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, is an incapacitant at low doses, while the high doses required to elicit mortality give the agent an excellent \u2018safety ratio.\u2019 Mycotoxins, produced by fungi, include trichothecenes (T-2 toxins), ochratoxin, and aflatoxin. Since these are low molecular weight compounds, these toxins result in symptoms more common to chemical agents. Some T-2 toxins are vesicants (blister agents) 400 times more potent than mustard gas, and their effects are observed in minutes rather than hours or days. Antitoxins have been developed for some toxins, although the requirement for rapid administration (e.g., before the onset of symptoms for BoNT) limits their utility in non-prophylactic situations.",

            "text": "Culture is suited to the identification of both bacteria and viruses. Bacterial cultures are typically grown on a nutrient-containing substrate from clinical or environmental samples, while viral cultures must be grown in host cells. Obtaining a sample that contains the pathogen can be difficult (e.g., bacteria may not be found in the blood in the early stages of the disease and will be absent if a patient has already begun antibiotic treatment), and the difficulty in culturing some agents can generate false negatives [1], [19]. Moreover, reaching an identifiable stage of growth can be slow, typically requiring several days. Some samples are even more extreme; culture of M. tuberculosis, for example, requires nine days or more [26], [27], [28], while Brucella species can take up to three weeks and are isolated from blood with 10\u201390% success [1], [2], [29]. To further complicate matters, while phenotypic diagnosis via microscopy can be used to identify inclusion bodies from poxvirus infections, this method is insufficient to differentiate individual poxviridae species, meaning that smallpox and the related pox species are indistinguishable by culture. A final consideration is that many of the bioagents mentioned here are extremely pathogenic, and culturing them can invite substantial risk and may require extensive containment facilities. Examples of cultured B. anthracis and Burkholderia pseudomallei are shown in Fig. 1\n.",

These assays traditionally use antibodies produced in host animals, although aptamers, peptides, and engineered antibody fragments are also used now for similar purposes. As illustrated in Fig. 2\n, for typical antigen detection, a complementary antibody, known as the capture antibody, is affixed to a substrate and captures any antigen present in the sample. Signal transduction is accomplished through the addition of a secondary reporter antibody that binds to the analyte and is labeled with a fluorophore, radioisotope, or other detectable label [30]. Because the analyte is sandwiched between the capture and reporter species, the descriptive term sandwich immunoassay is commonly used [1]. The same technique can be adapted to detect antibodies generated in an host following exposure.",

As one of the most well-developed detection techniques for bioagents, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has ELISAs for nearly 130 antibodies and antigens, including bacteria, viruses, and protein toxins as part of its Critical Reagents Program [1], [2], [16], [31]. ELISA offers relatively fast readout times (15 min to several hours) but does so at the cost of accuracy (50\u201370%) and sensitivity [1]. Moreover, the environmental susceptibility of the participating species (e.g., denaturation of the antibodies) limits application for continuous monitoring and in challenging environments around the world [30], [32], [33]. This has led the DoD and especially the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to invest heavily in the development of more stable antibodies. These include antibodies derived from sharks and camelids (e.g., llamas), which are structurally simpler and more tolerant of heat [34], [35], [36].",

Using target-specific oligonucleotide primers that hybridize to and flank the region of DNA to be amplified, a DNA polymerase, and a supply of nucleic acid precursors (deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates), replication of the target DNA is accomplished by subjecting the mixture to repeated, established cycles of heating, primer binding, and primer extension. The effect of this process is to render undetectably small quantities of genetic material (as few as 10 copies) sufficiently plentiful for detection. To amplify RNA from viruses, the process is modified to first convert the target RNA to complementary DNA by reverse transcription, after which the complementary DNA is amplified by PCR. Although cycling through PCR a sufficient number of times to guarantee a readout is time-consuming (6+ hours), by coupling a fluorescent reporter to the reaction, real-time monitoring is made possible [1]. PCR is the gold standard for virus detection; however, due to the nature of primer design, it may fail to detect new viral strains or mutants [1], [2], [38]. Moreover, because it is sensitive only to a region of DNA, a known pathogen could be engineered to be undetected by standard PCR through the omission of the region important for amplification [1].",

In combination, these options permit the design of probes that are able to respond to a variety of \u2018positive\u2019 conditions. For example, bacteria can be detected through antibody binding to specific moieties displayed on the cell surface, including proteins, carbohydrates, and sugars, while other antibodies can be used to detect secreted proteins such as toxins. An entirely different method, oligonucleotides on an NP surface can be used to capture genetic material, which can then be amplified by PCR. While either of these strategies will detect the analyte, additional factors, such as the thermal stability of the sensor, its response time and cost, analyte preparation, and assay sensitivity can inform which NM and conjugation strategy is optimally suited to address specific design constraints. As it currently stands, no technology stands out as the best in all of these areas; however, the NM toolbox provides us with many exciting paths forward [54].",

At their most basic, they provide a scaffold that is compatible with a large swath of biologically and chemically active molecules without compromising their activity, and the high surface/volume ratio intrinsic to nanoscale materials further enhances this utility [6], [8]. AuNPs range from 2 to 100 nm and exhibit a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) phenomenon that gives rise to excellent optical absorption properties capable of sensing changes near the AuNP surface. Below 2 nm in size, gold nanocrystals can also be fluorescent, and the term gold nanocluster is used to differentiate between materials exhibiting fluorescent and plasmonic signals. Plasmonic effects (and therefore AuNPs) dominate literature that focuses on sensing and detection using gold species. AuNPs can be coated with reactive ligands, allowing the use of covalent modification chemistries for the attachment of biomolecules (DNA, antibodies, proteins, etc.), including maleimide-thiol, NHS-ester, cycloaddition (click) chemistry, carbodiimide coupling (EDC), as well as non-covalent (e.g., biotin or NTA) or passive adsorption [55].",

            "text": "One of the most straightforward uses of AuNPs for detection involves functionalizing the AuNP surface with an oligonucleotide complementary to the target DNA, as shown in Fig. 3\n, for example, Brucella species [45]. Assays were complete in 1\u201310 min, in contrast to hours to weeks for PCR or culture, respectively, while attaining pg/\u03bcL detection limits. In the presence of the analyte, the AuNPs aggregate in a matter of minutes, giving rise to a colorimetric change that is not observed in the presence of non-complementary DNA (Fig. 3). While the color change is visible, absorption spectroscopy can provide more quantitative feedback and lowers the detection limit. By changing the surface functionalization to other DNA sequences, antibodies, or other capture elements, this system can easily be converted to the detection of not only other examples of bacterial DNA [27], [56], [57], [58], [59] but also viruses and certain toxins [60], [61], [62]. Electrochemical transduction using AuNPs provides a means of detection that can be applied in turbid or colored solutions. Electrochemical response resulting from the aggregation in solution of antibody-functionalized AuNPs has been applied to the detection of a variety of bioagents [6], [8], [58], [63], [64]. The same principle can be applied to a solid substrate that doubles as an electrode [58], [65], [66].",

Alternatively, replacing the solid substrate with functionalized magnetic microparticles provides a means for pulling the probe/target complexes out of a matrix for subsequent detection using a chip-based read-out system (Fig. 4\n) [68]. Functionalizing both a magnetic microparticle probe (MMP) and a AuNP with polynucleotide strands that together are complementary to the target analyte provides a means of linking the AuNP to the MMP in the presence of the analyte.

This can be achieved using NPs with intrinsic PL properties, most notably, quantum dots (QDs). QDs are a subset of NPs defined as quantum-confined semiconducting nanocrystals. Their unique properties, including size-dependent emission energies, small size, physical robustness, and flexible surface functionalization, have garnered significant interest for bioagent detection. QD-antibody conjugates have been highly successful in detecting protein toxins and viruses; examples include ricin [76] and S. typhi\n[77], as well as a multiplexed analysis of ricin, SEB, cholera, and shiga-toxin [78]. In addition to straightforward ELISAs [78], [79], antibody-labeled QDs can be used as a fluorescent tag and coupled with laboratory techniques such as flow cytometry [80], [81] or agglutination/flocculation assays [82]. The same principles can be applied to QDs that are functionalized with aptamers, synthetic DNA capture elements that have been engineered to recognize bacteria, viruses, and toxins [83], [84]. In these systems, the greatest benefit arises from the rapidity of the assay and, in some cases, the ability to multiplex by using QDs with different emission wavelengths. Furthermore, QD-antibody conjugates have been shown to amplify an SPR output signal, resulting in a 10-fold signal enhancement over analogous control single-domain antibody-based reporters used by themselves [85].",

By employing the distance-dependence of FRET between the QD-dye pair and biological recognition principles of single-chain variable fragments, Lee et al. developed a sensor for BoNT with a ratiometric PL output resulting in a limit of detection of 30 pM (Fig. 5\n) [47]. Another QD-based BoNT FRET sensor was developed by Sapsford et al., in which a Cy3-labeled peptide substrate was attached to the surface of the QD.

Like QDs, silica NPs can accommodate a variety of attachment chemistries, and the large number of encapsulated fluorophores ensures that they are highly photostable and resistant to photobleaching. In one notable example, Ai et al. have created a detector for calcium dipicolinate (CaDPA) \u2013 a biomarker for B. anthracis spores that comprises about 10% of the spore's dry weight \u2013 using silica NPs doped with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) [48]. An organic complex, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid dianhydride (EDTAD), is covalently coordinated to the surface of the NP, and europium(III) introduced into the synthetic reaction is chelated by the EDTA (Fig. 6\n). Detection of CaDPA is indicated by an increase in luminescence from the Eu3+ by capitalizing on its water sensitivity. While coordinated by the EDTA, two water molecules remain in the inner coordination sphere of the Eu3+, reducing emission from what would be expected in an anhydrous environment by providing a pathway to nonradiative quenching for the Eu3+; thus green fluorescence from the FITC dominates. The addition of CaDPA, however, displaces the coordinated water molecules, resulting in an improvement in the emission intensity from the Eu3+ complex, while the FITC emission intensity remains unchanged. The assay is able to detect concentrations of CaDPA six orders of magnitude lower than the infectious dose of spores in a mere two minutes. The same EDTA/lanthanide/CaDPA chemistry has been used on other substrates, including polyacrylonitrile and carbon NPs, both of which are inherently luminescent and eliminate the need for a doped NP at the core of the device [90], [91].",

For example, using polycationic magnetic NPs, Bromberg et al. were able to nonspecifically capture polyanionic DNA from solutions, including environmental samples, and the now-sequestered genetic material could be identified by PCR, as shown in Fig. 7\n[49]. While employing a traditional technique for bioagent identification, this method facilitates analyte isolation from environmental samples. Biological material is scavenged from the analytical solution by the magnetic NPs, which are concentrated using high-gradient magnetic separation and then washed before being released from the magnetic field and processed for PCR. Decorating the surface of a magnetic NP with antibodies as a capture element can simplify the detection process and eliminate the need for pairing with PCR, although that convenience comes at the cost of the ability to do general monitoring. Magnetic capture and concentration has been demonstrated with B. anthracis spores using antibody-functionalized magnetic NPs followed by detection through charge-transfer mechanisms [93]. Pairing a second antibody immobilized on a column surface to the antibody-driven capture of analyte in solution results in a specialized sandwich assay with signal transduction through a magnetic detection system, as has been demonstrated with Y. pestis\n[94]. In a solution-based analysis, changes in magnetic susceptibility with increasing hydrodynamic radius (arising from then capture of the analyte) can be used, a phenomenon demonstrated with Brucella antibodies [50]. Magnetic NPs have also been employed in bioagent detection schemes that use SPR [95] and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) [96] for signal transduction.",

Metallic nanowires synthesized through the sequential deposition of different metals can be used to create a barcode-like system in which the order of metals is characteristic to the target analyte, and different barcodes used together allow for multiplexing [51]. Using the barcode as a substrate for a sandwich assay with a fluorophore tag, the presence of an analyte can be ascertained through fluorimetry, and the identity of the analyte by \u2018reading the barcode,\u2019 as shown in Fig. 8\n. Other nanowire- or nanorod-based sensors rely less on the morphology of the NM and more on the intrinsic properties of the constituent elements. For example, a silicon nanowire was functionalized with a peptide nucleic acid to which was attached an oligonucleotide complementary to the analyte (here the dengue virus), and hybridization led to a change in the resistance of the wire [97]. Antibody-functionalized nanowires or nanorods of a variety of compositions, including indium oxide [98], zinc oxide [99], silver [46], and silicon [100], have been used for the detection of bioagents using various detection paradigms.

            "text": "Carbon NMs are valued in biosensors for their high electrical conductivity and biocompatibility. Simple aggregation and aggregate visualization of carbon nanotubes can be used to indicate the presence of an analyte, as demonstrated with B. anthracis\n[101], while other nanoscale carbon-based sensors exploit a wide range of properties. Changes in the emission wavelength of nanoscale carbon arising from hybridization of surface-decorating single-stranded DNA complementary to an analyte can indicate the presence of an analyte in solution [90], [102]. In addition to exploiting their own intrinsic photophysical properties, carbon nanotubes have been used as substrates for fluorescence-based assays, as demonstrated by Lee et al. in the development of a carbon nanotube/AuNP/QD NM composite for the detection of influenza virus [103]. As shown in Fig. 9\n, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are seeded with AuNPs in situ, and these are subsequently functionalized with influenza antibodies. Antibody-functionalized QDs added to the CNT/AuNP assemblies adhere to any viral analyte that has been captured. The detection ensemble gives PL feedback that can be used to detect the virus at concentrations spanning six orders of magnitude. Carbon NMs can also serve as quenching species; coordinating single-stranded DNA labeled with a fluorophore to the surface of a C60 cluster results in quenched PL from the fluorophore, while hybridization with complementary (analyte) DNA results in the release of the DNA/fluorophore complex from the C60 and initiation of PL [104]. Carbon NMs have also been incorporated into sensors that rely on electrochemical feedback for analyte detection [105], [106], [107]. For example, employing a composite of carbon nanotubes and nanoscale zirconia on an indium-tin-oxide electrode, Das et al. were able to demonstrate changes in electrochemical impedance arising from modifications of the surface [52]. For a more comprehensive examination of the role of carbon NMs in the detection of bio- and chemical agents, the reader may wish to refer to the review by Kumar et al. [10].",

            "text": "While the sensors described above are derived from predominantly inorganic NMs, the use of biological molecules on a nano-length scale also falls within the purview of this review. Among these are nanobarcodes, which consist of three single-stranded oligonucleotides that hybridize to form Y-DNA [108]. Two of these ssDNA molecules are tagged with a fluorophore, one red and one green, while the third possesses a region complementary to the target analyte, as shown in Fig. 10\n. This basic design can be expanded to create a library of nanobarcodes with two important properties: the un-tagged oligonucleotide is complementary to different target analytes (region labeled as Probe 1\u20135), and the ratio of green to red fluorophores changes, differentiating each probe (and therefore each analyte) through the ratiometric measurement of red and green channels. By immobilizing capture DNA complementary to a different region of the target analyte on a substrate, here polystyrene microbeads, the analyte can be scavenged from a solution and then labeled through the introduction of the nanobarcodes. The method has been shown to detect attomole concentrations of multiple synthetic bioagent signature sequences, including those from anthrax, Ebola, and SARS, in 30 seconds under multiplexing conditions.Food- and water-borne illnessesFood- and water-borne pathogens naturally have low infective doses and high virulence; they are widespread and therefore available; and they are inherently stable in food or water [1]. Despite practical impediments (e.g., dilution, food and water treatment), an attack on food or water supplies could be quite powerful as a means of inciting mass casualty and fear [109]. For example, a 2005 study identified vulnerable points in the processing of milk at which the introduction of a gram of BoNT would sicken 100,000 consumers [110]. Other food- and water-borne pathogens identified on the CDC's list of bioterrorism agents include Salmonella and Shigella species, Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholera, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, the protozoa Cryptosporidium parvum, and the hepatitis A virus. In addition to the general requirements for bioagent detection, detecting these pathogens require sensors that function in unusual matrices (e.g., milk) [49], [111], [112], [113].\n",

Exploring these requirements to bring a promising sensor to market are beyond the scope of this review; instead we refer the reader to several resources with that process as their focus [25], [117] and to the limited literature that has done side-by-side testing of some commercially available sensors [118], [119].

            "text": "While traditional methods of detecting bioagents can achieve excellent sensitivity and specificity, these techniques are often slow and expensive and require ample sample preparation and laboratory conditions for their execution. There are certainly many circumstances under which these methods are not only appropriate but warranted and thus worth the effort, but a wide range of conditions also exist in which these techniques are insufficient. Whether continuously monitoring environmental samples, screening thousands of samples from a long-term monitoring program, or rapidly responding to a bioterrorism attack or virulent outbreak, devoting even a few hours to the preparation and analysis of one sample may prove too costly. Moreover, detection of these biothreats is most needed in the field at the point of release, where access to laboratory-grade instrumentation is not feasible and funding is often scarse. It is in these areas that the nanoscale sensors highlighted in this review truly excel. Many build on immunogenic assays that have already been established, exploiting the scale and consequent dispersability of NMs to improve the assay time. Others use NMs as a means of processing environmental samples to achieve lower detection limits than could be reached in a similar timeframe by traditional means. Although conveying only a small cross-section of what has been actually applied or even considered, the diversity of the NMs and conjugate biochemistries highlighted here offers a compelling case for their continued development and expanded use in accommodating the specific demands of bioagent detection in the laboratory, in the field, or in complex matrices.",
