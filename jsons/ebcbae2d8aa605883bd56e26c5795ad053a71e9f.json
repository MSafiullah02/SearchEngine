For instance, recent years have witnessed large outbreaks of Ebola in Africa and Zika in Central and South America, and there have been serious concerns and heated debates on public health at the global scope. Cancers, which are characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells and induced by various factors such as tobacco, infectious organisms, genetic mutations, and immune conditions, are the leading cause of death for much of the US population [3] . The threats from infectious diseases and cancers become increasingly prevalent due to factors such as changing trends in human and animal migration, increasing urbanization, environmental deterioration, and climate change. Early disease diagnosis and effective treatment have become critical for the clinical regulation and management of infectious diseases and cancers. Convectional disease diagnostics has relied on techniques such as optical microscopy, culture, immunoassays, and nucleic acid amplification [4] . A standard process for disease diagnostics includes the following steps: (a) collection and transport of biological samples such as blood, urine, and tissue swabs from the point of care; (b) analysis of the samples by experienced staffs in a centralized laboratory; and (c) notification of the results to the clinicians and patients. Due to highly frequent access to energy resources like electricity, time-consuming procedures, and need for well-trained personnel, the conventional clinical methods prelude the rapid disease detection and response at the primary care. Their drawbacks are prominently revealed in resource-limited and underdeveloped areas.",

These include areas where healthcare infrastructure is limited and high-quality timely medical care is inaccessible [5, 6] . With the advancements of nanotechnologies and micro-/nanofluidic technologies, many innovative POC biosensors with optical, electrical, and mechanical interrogations have been developed. However, two major challenges, matrix effect and system integration, have prevented the further developments and uses of POC devices [4] . Most biosensors can have excellent performance with pristine samples. However, they still need to be strictly evaluated with clinical samples due to the matrix effect. Generally, the matrix of human fluids becomes more complex in infected states, which could lead to the clogging of microfluidic channels and the decrease of the transduction signals. Transformation of POC devices from proof-of-concept and benchtop to bedside care and point-of-care settings requires the system integration. However, to integrate and package various modules for sample preparation and signal detection into a fully automated and user-friendly platform remains challenging.",

Three prominent techniques that exploit plasmon-enhanced optical near fields to manipulate particles and molecules in fluids have been developed: (i) SPP-based plasmonic tweezers, (ii) LSPR-based plasmonic tweezers, and (iii) plasmonic tweezers based on selfinduced back-action (SIBA). Both top-down fabrication techniques such as electron beam lithography and focused ion beam lithography and bottom-up fabrication techniques such as directed assembly and self-assembly have been applied to engineer plasmonic structures for targeted tweezing platforms [14, 15] . SPPs can propagate along the metal-fluid interface with evanescent characteristics perpendicular to the interface. Accordingly, SPP-based tweezers have been used to transport and assemble microscale particles [16] [17] [18] . A patterned SPP landscape was constructed from an array of micrometer-sized gold disks on a glass substrate to achieve parallel trapping of individual particles, as shown in Fig. 5 .1a [19] . The simulated trapping potential in Fig. 5 .1b shows that the trapped particle on the gold disk is stabilized in a forward position along the SPP propagation direction.",

            "text": "Along with the enhanced electromagnetic fields, surface plasmons can induce strong light absorption and photothermal effects [26] . The competing factors between light absorption and heat dissipation determine the temperature increase and spatial temperature distribution. For a spherical gold nanoparticle immersed in water and illuminated by a laser of LSPR wavelength, the temperature increase is uniform in the particle and inversely proportional to the distance outside the particle, resulting in a thermal gradient built up at the metal-water interface [26] . For metal nanoparticle arrays as illustrated in Fig. 5 .2a, two heating regimes exist depending on the particle size, particle number, and geometry of the array. These are temperature confinement regime and temperature delocalization regime, as shown in Fig. 5 .2b [27] . To reach the temperature confinement regime, both large spacing between nanoparticles and small illumination area are preferred. The plasmon-assisted heating was exploited to control fluid motion at the microscale and nanoscale [28] . In typical plasmofluidic systems where the characteristic size of the plasmonic structure is very small (~100 nm), thermal diffusion of the fluid dominates in heat dissipation and thermal convection plays a minor role. As shown in Fig. 5 .2c-d, the thermal convection velocity at small plasmonic structures is limited to 1-100 nm/s. In this case, the thermal convection can barely contribute to the motion of the particles in the fluidic environment. The thermal convection field can be further damped by more than one order of magnitude when the height of the fluid chamber is reduced to $10 \u03bcm, as illustrated in Fig. 5 .2e.",

The specimen-binding events change the dielectric constant over the metal layer. Several approaches have been applied to excite SPPs, including prism coupling [30, 31] , grating coupling [32] , and waveguide coupling [33] . LSPR-based sensors utilize the strong electromagnetic response of metal nanoparticles to refractive-index changes in their surroundings [1, 12, 34, 35] . Various nanostructured metal arrays such as nanohole arrays [36, 37] , nanowell arrays [38] , nanocross arrays [39] , nanocube arrays [40] , nanomouth arrays [41] , nanomushroom arrays [42] , nanodisk arrays [15, 43] , and nanobowtie arrays [44] have been designed for the refractive-index sensing with high figure of merit (FOM).

There are two major microfluidic approaches toward SERS-active plasmofluidic sensors: (i) mixing the sample with SERS-active colloids in a microfluidic channel [52] . Such plasmofluidic sensors have the advantages of measuring biological particles and molecules in their native watery environments. However, since the molecular adsorption or binding to the SERSactive surfaces relies on the diffusion of the analytes in solutions, the Raman signal intensities will be weaker than those of SERS based on dried samples on solid-state Raman substrates.",

Recently, we have developed a technique that uses plasmon-enhanced thermophoresis for reversible and dynamic assembly of plasmonic nanoparticles for in situ SERS analysis of molecules, as shown in Fig. 5 .4a [57] . Once a temperature gradient is created on a plasmonic substrate that is illuminated with a low-power laser beam, the positive-charged nanoparticles will migrate to the hot region under a thermally induced local electrical field ( Fig. 5 .4b) and form nanoparticle assemblies at the laser spot ( Fig. 5.4c ). As shown in Fig. 5 .4d, the dynamic assemblies feature a high particle density and small interparticle distance, which are suitable for the excitation of multiple electromagnetic \"hot spots\" for SERS with enhanced sensitivity. The metal surface is functionalized with recognition elements for selective detection. Once biological particles or molecules are captured by the metal surface, the SPP mode will be modified, and a signature in the reflected light will be probed by a detector for analysis (Reproduced with permission [1] .

Plasmonic tweezers have been employed in manipulating various bio-specimens such as cells [58, 59] , DNAs [60, 61] , and proteins [62] [63] [64] at high spatial resolution and low optical power. Using simple optics to create the trapping force, plasmonic tweezers can be readily incorporated into microfluidic systems to design novel plasmofluidic chips with functionalities such as single-particle trapping [57, 62] , parallel trapping [58] , co-trapping [63] , and kinetic detection of biological objects [61, 64] . One has also recognized multiple issues of current plasmofluidic systems and proposed new solutions. First, due to the near-field nature of surface plasmons and weak thermoplasmonic convection, only particles that diffuse to the close proximity to the plasmonic structures can be captured [65] . Second, isolated plasmonic nanostructures are commonly used to avoid collective heating and particle agglomeration, preventing long-distance transportation and dynamic manipulations. Third, in contrast to conventional optical tweezers that are capable of three-dimensional (3D) manipulations, plasmonic tweezers are often limited to two-dimensional (2D) trapping of objects at the plasmonic structures. New solutions to these issues in the plasmofluidic systems include the adoption of optical components with a higher level of spatial control [66] and the exploitation of loss-induced heating at the plasmonic structures [67] .",

By harnessing the permittivity gradient in the electric double layer of the charged surface of the cell membrane, we succeeded at the low-power cell trapping with a plasmon-enhanced temperature gradient field. Arbitrary spatial arrangements of cells at a resolution of 100 nm and precise rotation of both single and multiple cells were demonstrated with an optical control system based on a digital micromirror device (DMD). Optical trapping of single DNA molecules and DNA translocations in LiCl buffers were demonstrated using a solid-state plasmonic nanopore, as shown in Fig. 5 .5b [61] . The nanopore is positioned between the gap of a gold bowtie antenna. The enhancement of the rate of DNA translocation events was observed and attributed to the plasmon-assisted local heating and the thermophoresis in the thermal gradient. In another example, single bovine serum albumin (BSA) molecules were trapped onto a double-hole structure with a 3.5-mW laser beam focused by a 100\u00c2 oil immersion objective [62] , as shown in Fig. 5 .5c. The folding and unfolding states of a trapped BSA molecule were revealed by measuring the intensity of the transmitted light. The same research group demonstrated the protein-antibody co-trapping at the double-hole structure and measured the binding kinetics of the protein-ligand interaction, opening up new avenues for studying intermolecular interactions at the single-molecule level [63, 64] .",

To realize 3D low-power trapping and transportation of sub-100nm objects over a long range, Quidant's group implemented the SIBA-based tweezers at the tip extremity of a metal-coated optical fiber, which can be raster-scanned in all three spatial directions for dynamic manipulations and simultaneously used to collect the reflected signal and identify the different trapping regimes [66] , as shown in Fig. 5 .6a-b.

Conventional technologies for nucleic acid sensing feature high precision and optimal LOD. However, they require sophisticated instrumentation with multiple time-consuming steps, including pathogen isolation, PCR, and target identification. Plasmofluidic sensors are extensively explored to achieve precise, multiplexed, and label-free detection [31, [69] [70] [71] [72] . Springer et al. demonstrated a SPP sensor with a four-channel flow cell (known as dispersionless microfluidics), as shown in Fig. 5 .7a-b. The microfluidics suppressed the decrease of analyte concentration at the sensing area when different liquid samples were switched and thus improved the kinetic response and sensitivity [73] . Short sequences of DNA (20 bases) that are characteristic for E. coli cells were probed in less than 4 min for a concentration down to fM levels, outperforming most SPP sensors by one order of magnitude. SERS-based plasmofluidic sensors for high-throughput detection of multiple DNAs in single assays were also developed. One example is based on selfassembled gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) on a gold nanowire (Au NW) at the presence of target DNAs [69] . Raman signal was significantly enhanced by placing the DNA molecules in the interstices of the gold-particle-on-wire structure. The structure was constructed by sequential incubation of Au NWs premodified by thiolated probe DNAs in solutions of target DNAs and Au NPs functionalized by reporter DNAs with Raman dyes (Fig. 5.7c) . A high selectivity is assured because only those target DNAs with sequences complementary to the probe DNAs and the reporter DNAs can form the particle-on-wire structure for the enhanced signal of the Raman dyes. The sensor was applied for quantitative detection of DNA concentrations, multiplexed detection of bacterial DNAs, and identification of pathogenic bacteria in real clinical samples. The results on bacteria agreed well with those obtained by conventional culture-based assays, as illustrated in Fig. 5 .7d.",

The cancer is hard to be detected when the tumor is small and at nonmetastatic stage [82, 83] . The sensor is based on gold nanoprisms functionalized with -S-C6-ssDNAs. Direct hybridization between the -S-C6-ssDNAs and the target miRNAs forms DNA duplex (Fig. 5.7e) , which increases the refractive index in local environment of the nanoprism and redshifts the LSPR peak wavelength. The high sensitivity down to 10 \u00c018 M for specific miRNA-10b benefits from multiple factors: (a) atomically flat surface of the nanoprisms allowing efficient duplex formation, (b) high charge density of the duplex greatly altering the local refractive index, and (c) strong field enhancement at the tips of nanoprisms. Detection of miRNA-10b at a low concentration was achieved in pancreatic cancer cell lines, derived tissue culture media, human plasma, and plasma exosomes. Quantification of miRNA-10b in highly purified exosomes that were isolated from patients with PDAC and chronic pancreatitis (CP) was shown in Fig. 5 .7f. PDAC patients had much higher miRNA-10b levels than CP patients. Integration of the sensor into microfluidics is expected to further enhance the miRNA measurements and the disease diagnosis with identifiable miRNA signatures.",

A plasmonic sensor with dispersionless microfluidics was developed to detect protein biomarker of MDS disease (i.e., sVEGFR-1) via interaction with its high-affinity bio-receptor VEGF-A [95] . A detection limit of 25 ng/mL was achieved in 2% human blood plasma by using the sequential injection approach. However, the traditional experimental design that relies on a specific bio-receptor (known as \"lock-and-key\" approach) is limited by interference from molecules that are structurally or chemically alike. Moreover, most diseases are associated with multiple biomarkers, which necessitate the detection of a total protein distribution rather than a particular protein. To address these challenges, Choi et al. developed a \"cross-reactive\"-based sensor using a substrate of multiple segments of surfaces that are pre-adsorbed by different types of proteins. A distinctive pattern of SPP angle shifts arose from the interaction of the substrate with a sample of variable proteins [84] . The SPP angle pattern was used to clarify the concentration distributions of proteins and a specific biomarker, C-reactive protein (CRP), in a cocktail sample.",

However, protein microarrays often involve time-consuming fabrication process. Dehydrated or denatured proteins suffer a shorter lifetime of normal functionality. To overcome these problems, a multiplexed enzymatic synthesis via surfacecoupled transcription-translation was employed for in vitro fabrication of protein microarrays and for their immediate use in biosensing based on a microfluidic platform, as illustrated in Fig. 5 .8a-c. The plasmofluidic system includes generator, control, and detector components. Multiple RNA transcripts were created at the generator through surface reaction of RNA polymerase with adsorbed dsDNA and translated into proteins by cell-free protein synthesis. The synthesized proteins diffused to the detector element and formed protein microarrays. As a demonstration, binding of anti-GFP and antiluciferase to the protein arrays was characterized with SPRI and time-resolved absorption kinetic measurement, as shown in Fig. 5 .8d-g. With multiple surface chemistries, the plasmofluidic system can be further implemented for multiplexed SPRI biosensing in clinical practices.",

Uludag et al. used a matrix elimination buffer to eliminate nonspecific binding of 98% serum proteins and performed a sandwich assay, in which the target proteins were sandwiched between a bottom layer of capture antibody and a top layer of antibody-modified Au NPs [86] . The Au NPs reduced the refractive-index mismatch between the buffer and the sample, leading to amplified SPP signal and enhanced sensitivity. A LOD of 0.29 ng mL \u00c01 for tPSA in 75% human serum was attained, which was comparable to that achieved by a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor. SPP and QCM sensors were further combined to detect sub-attomolar human \u03b1-thrombin [96] . The sandwich immunoassays with SPP-based sensors are expected to improve early-stage cancer diagnosis and prognosis.",

When a single protein binds to the receptors on the surface of the nanorod, a small redshift of the longitudinal LSPR wavelength changes the absorption cross section of the nanorod at the wavelength of the heating beam, which can be measured with the transduced temperature change. Unlike the resonance Rayleigh scattering, the contrast scale of photothermal microscopy permits the measurement of mode volume that is commensurate to the size of a protein.",

For the sensor, a periodic array of gold nanorods with a bio-recognition layer was integrated with a microfluidic network. The authors applied the sensor to detect AFP and PSA, which are indicators of prostate cancers, at a LOD of as low as 5 ng/mL and a timescale of minutes. Chen et al. developed a highly integrated, multiarrayed LSPR sensor for massively parallel high-throughput detection of multiple cytokine biomarkers in a low-volume assay, as shown in Fig. 5 .9b [88] . Consisting of 480 LSPR sensing spots with multistep processing for eight different samples, including manual loading, incubation, and washing, the sensor allowed quantitative measurements at concentrations ranging from 10 to 10,000 pg/mL in a 1-\u03bcL sample of serum. It also enabled multianalyte detection of ten cycles for each sample in 40 min, which is more than ten times shorter than traditional sandwich immunoassays. The sensor was further applied to measure cytokine levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in two neonates, who received cardiopulmonary bypass surgery for congenital heart disease within 24 h. The measurement was valuable for defining the postsurgery responses and predicting the anticipated assay outcomes.",

Briefly, multiple batches of gold nanorods functionalized with different proteins and one batch without functionalization (as a reference) were driven through the flow cell consecutively to generate a positon-encoded sensor. The encoding of the sensor was carried out by repetitive recording of the position of each randomly deposited gold nanorod, as shown in Fig. 5 .9c. As a demonstration, the sensor was applied to study the interactions of three bacterial division proteins with a target protein FtsZ, which is an essential element of the division machinery in most bacterial systems. The results had an excellent agreement with those by conventional composition gradient static light scattering and fluorescence anisotropy. With the small device size, reduced sample volume, and built-in statistics, the sensor is envisioned to be a powerful tool in drug screening and discovery applications.",

One of the most popular strategies uses a sandwich immunocomplex protocol with antibody-conjugated metal particles [89, [108] [109] [110] [111] . Choo's group implemented magnetic tweezers [108] and optoelectronic tweezers [109] in a gradient microfluidic channel to form sandwich immunocomplexes for the sensitive and automatic quantitative analysis in less than 30 min. In the immunocomplexes, target antigens were sandwiched between antibody-conjugated microspheres and antibody-conjugated SERS-active nanoparticles. The magnetic tweezer-based immunoassay had a LOD of 1-10 ng/mL for rabbit IgG, and the optoelectronic tweezer-based one achieved a LOD of 98 pg/mL for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). The same group further integrated sandwich immunoassay [110] with gradient microfluidics to achieve programmable and automatic analysis of biomarkers with small sample volume, easy sample preparation, and short assay time [89] . After the AFP antigens were captured by the immobilized antibodies on gold microwells, polyclonal anti-AFP antibody-conjugated particles were attached to form the sandwich immunocomplexes, as shown in Fig. 5 .10a. A similar methodology was applied to detect hepatitis B virus antigen in human blood and blood plasma. Hepatitis B virus infection is a common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide [112] . Using a sandwich-typed immunoassay, Zou et al. detected carcinoembryonic antigen in raw blood samples with a LOD of as low as 10 \u00c012 M. Carcinoembryonic antigen is a wide-spectrum biomarker for diagnosis of various cancers [111] .",

In the microfluidic cell identification system, two spectroscopically distinguishable SBTs that target distinct cell epitopes were used to label cells in a single focused line by hydrodynamic flow, as illustrated in Fig. 5 .10c [93] . The identification was accomplished by measuring the relative signal from the cancer-specific SBT versus the cell-identifying universal control SBT. The discrimination efficiency can reach 1 cancer cell from a population of 100 normal cells due to spectroscopic richness of the Raman bands of the reporter molecules on the two SBTs and algorithmic effectiveness of the two deconvolution strategies for the composite spectrum.

The sensor exploits plasmon-enhanced extraordinary light transmission through metal nanohole arrays and is applicable to a broad range of pathogens. It was applied to detect PT-Ebola virus in PBS buffer solution based on the consistent redshift (>14 nm) of the plasmon resonance wavelength. A 4-nm shift in resonance wavelength was observed for virus detection in biological media consisted of cell growth medium and 7% fetal calf serum. The detectable virus concentration ranges from 10 6 to 10 9 PFU/mL, which is relevant to both clinical testing and drug screening. Inci et al. developed a plasmofluidic platform for label-free, high-sensitive, highspecific, and reproducible HIV viral load quantification from unprocessed whole blood sample [117] . Surface chemistry and highly specific antibody immobilization were applied to capture the viruses at the electromagnetic \"hot spots\" and to minimize background signal from nonspecific binding of blood cells. Briefly, poly-L-lysine-modified polystyrene with terminal amine group was used as substrates to capture gold nanoparticles. The gold nanoparticles were treated with different chemicals consecutively, including 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid, N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride, N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide, NeutrAvidin, and biotinylated anti-gp120 polyclonal antibody. The antibody was positioned in a favorable orientation to have a high capture efficiency for the viruses. A SPP platform based on DNA-RNA hybridization was also developed to detect viruses plaguing plant food and feed crop plants [122] .",

In particular, plasmonic tweezers achieved noninvasive trapping of biological cells, DNAs, and proteins at the single-entity level. 3D manipulations were demonstrated with plasmonic tweezers based on an optical fiber tip with high-resolution mechanical motion control. Long-range and rapid delivery of nanoparticles was achieved with electrothermoplasmonics. Most of the current tweezers used microfluidic channels as passive containers for sample solutions. It is anticipated that future plasmonic tweezers will fully reap the benefits of micro-/ nanofluidics to further enhance their functionalities for biosensing and diagnostic applications. In particular, the light-fluid interactions at the nanoscale can be explored to achieve versatile multifunctional plasmofluidic tweezers [7] . Our preliminary study indicated that the plasmon-enhanced photothermal effects such as thermophoresis are one of the promising strategies for optical manipulations in variable fluidic environments. A variety of plasmofluidic sensors has been developed to detect and analyze nucleic acids, proteins, pathogens, and drugs in life sciences, disease diagnostics, and drug discovery. Innovative microfluidic design, plasmonic engineering, and surface functionalization have led to sensitive, robust, and label-free POC biosensors. The next-generation plasmofluidic sensors are expected to target at translational and clinical applications [4] . For the purpose, the sensors need to be a highly integrated, robust, and user-friendly system that can handle a variety of clinical samples such as urine, blood, and saliva and enables POC diagnostics at field settings.",
