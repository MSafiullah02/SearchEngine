Unilateral testing of the sense of smell sometimes will show a loss on one side. CRS was viewed as a solely conductive cause of olfactory dysfunction, but more studies suggest that olfactory dysfunction secondary to CRS is caused by conductive and neural factors. Kern [4] looked at the histopathologic changes in the olfactory mucosa of patients who had CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery. Neuroepithelial inflammation was found with olfactory deficits, suggesting that inflammation of the olfactory epithelium, in addition to altered airflow, may contribute to olfactory losses.",

Nasal endoscopy is especially helpful in identifying obstructive causes of olfactory losses. Anterior rhinoscopy alone can miss 51% of obstruction of the olfactory cleft versus 9% for nasal endoscopy [26]. During the nasal endoscopy, attention should be paid to the patency of the olfactory cleft and middle meatus; the presence of polyps or tumors; mucosal edema of the sinonasal mucosa; the presence of airspace between the middle turbinate and the septum, especially superiorly toward the olfactory cleft; and presence of adhesions, postoperative changes, or crusting.",

Optic-disk examination can determine the presence of papilledema, a sign of increased intracranial pressure seen in patients who have unilateral olfactory dysfunction secondary to tumors of the olfactory groove. Tumors of the olfactory groove and sphenoidal ridge can cause the combination of symptoms known as Foster Kennedy syndrome: ipsilateral hyposmia or anosmia, ipsilateral optic nerve atrophy, and central papilledema. Because olfactory dysfunction can be a first sign of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or multi-infarct dementia, the otolaryngologist can perform the Mini-Mental State Examination if dementia is suspected. If further assessment of dementia is required, proper referral to a neurophysiologist should be made.",

The UPSIT has been studied extensively and has norms based on testing 4000 people. Scores are compared with various patient groups and against sex- and age-related norms [32]. According to the test results, a patient's olfactory function is classified as normosmia, mild microsmia, moderate microsmia, severe microsmia, anosmia, or probable malingering.

Patients with chorda tympani injuries complain of phantom taste (metallic, sometimes salty or bitter) more frequently than loss of taste [45]. Trauma to the lingual or pharyngeal branches of cranial nerve IX during tonsillectomy or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty also can result in the taste dysfunction. Pathologic involvement of cranial nerves IX and X in glomus tumors, squamous cell carcinoma, or schwannoma with other neurologic deficits will produce a loss of taste. Head trauma rarely causes a loss of taste, with a reported incidence of 0.4% to 0.5% [46].",

The patient tastes each solution and at the same time the tones are presented through headphones. The patient estimates the perceived magnitude for each stimulus.

Four standardized sizes of filter paper soaked with a strong concentration of four basic tastes are placed randomly on the four quadrants of the tongue and both sides of the soft palate. Cotton-tipped swabs soaked with basic tastes also can be used as an applicator (\nFig. 3). Patients then identify the quality of the taste and rate the intensity with a number from 1 to 10, with 10 being the strongest. The variation of this test is the three-drop technique, which involves placing three drops of a given chemical on a random portion of the tongue. The concentration is titrated to obtain the threshold of sensitivity. Recently, several tests have been developed in Germany that resemble this technique but are more standardized in the form of \u201ctaste strips,\u201d wafers, or tablets with specific concentration of the stimuli [50], [51], [52]. Some allow testing of the whole mouth, whereas others facilitate testing of each side of the tongue separately.",

Patients are asked to rinse their mouth with water. Elimination of the unpleasant taste suggests that the stimulus is real.

Also, topical anesthesia applied to the tongue or mouth can eliminate the taste caused by a genuine tastant or peripheral taste dysfunction. The source of the genuine tastant could be saliva, laryngopharyngeal reflux, or sinonasal drainage. Taste phantoms can intensify after the topical anesthesia has been applied to the mouth, such as in a patient complaining of the metallic taste after ear surgery with injury to the chorda tympani.",

With physical examination, however, clinical history can help to establish the diagnosis and guide the treatment if available. A clinician evaluating a patient who has smell and taste loss must understand that \u201ctaste\u201d complaints usually are symptoms of an olfactory dysfunction. The distinction between true gustatory loss (bitter, sweet, salty, sour, or umami) and olfactory loss, the inability to perceive complex flavors of food, will help clarify the patient's diagnosis.
