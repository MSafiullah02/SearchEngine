This approach has several drawbacks, stemming from biases or lack of availability of data and instability of parameter estimates. Here we take the opposite approach -that we call reverse epidemiology. Given the data, we reconstruct backward in time an ensemble of networks of contacts, and we assess the impact of measures on that specific realization of the contagion process. This approach is robust because it only depends on parameters that describe the evolution of the disease within one individual (e.g. latency time) and not on parameters that describe the spread of the epidemics in a population. Using this method, we assess the impact of preventive quarantine on the ongoing outbreak of Covid-19 in Italy. This gives an estimate of how many infected could have been avoided had preventive quarantine been enforced at a given time.",

At least in part, this is because social distancing may not be possible in the household or in other circumstances (e.g. in a hospital). In addition, lock-down of entire countries is clearly unsustainable in the long run, for several reasons. Social distancing reduces the number of contacts of individuals, unconditionally on their morbidity state. Preventive quarantine is an additional measure where quarantine is applied to all the contacts of an infected individual as soon as the latter is tested positive. This may not stop contacts of the infected individual from developing the infection, but it closes the possibility that, if the contact develops the infection, he or she will go on to infect further people.",

During the epidemics, this approach is not feasible, because data is scarce and unreliable, and consequently estimates of model parameters are affected by considerable uncertainty. We apply a modelfree strategy for using data available up to now (or possibly further extrapolated with plausible scenarios) to understand how the dynamics of the epidemics would have changed if preventive quarantine had been enforced at a particular time in the past. The idea is that the dynamics of the epidemics can be reversed backward, thereby constructing a probabilistic network of contagion contacts in the population of confirmed cases. For each such reconstruction, the epidemics can be run forward again, with preventive quarantine enforced. This provides a picture of how much preventive quarantine would have affected the epidemics, had it been implemented at a given time.",

Alternatively, contact tracing can be done by interviewing positives; a recent online survey of Spanish respondents, suggests that p be as high as 80% on the basis of individual interviews [4] .

This construction 4 gives a possible history of how the contagion has spread up to time t.

We extend the data up to April 5 th with a possible scenario of how the epidemics may evolve under a slowly varying downward trend 6 . This sheds light on the effects of preventive quarantine on a longer timescale. We assumed a geometric distribution for the distributions of T i and L i , with E[T i ] = 3 and E[L i ] Top: New positive Covid-19 cases (black lines) for the FVG (top left) and Veneto (top right) regions. The data up to April 4 th (vertical line at day 41) is continued by simulating a possible scenario. This dataset is compared with the new positives under a preventive quarantine measure (p = 0.8) enforced on March 18 th (vertical line at day 24) in 100 independent runs of the reconstructed epidemics (green dots). Averages are reported as red lines. Bottom left: Average new positives in 100 runs of he reconstructed epidemics with preventive quarantine for different values of p for the FVG Region. Bottom right: Fraction of the new positives that should be dealt with with preventive quarantine for different values of p for the Veneto Region.",
