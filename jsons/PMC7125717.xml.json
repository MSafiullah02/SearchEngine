Staff can be left feeling fearful for their own and their family's health (Maunder et al., 2003); stigmatised, alienated and isolated (Mitchell et al., 2002); and in some cases can be left suffering post-traumatic stress disorder (Chan and Huak, 2004). During a crisis in the ICU setting, it has been shown that staff distress is more likely to occur when there are unexpectedly high demands placed on them which are unmatched by appropriate resources (Piquette et al., 2009). The bulk of research related to pandemic outbreaks often focuses on the epidemiology and disease process or organisational issues. Often the lived experiences of the staff dealing with the care of the patient are not reported and it is essential that these experiences are acknowledged and taken into consideration for future pandemic planning.",

In Queensland, the highest total H1N1 admissions to ICU was reported with the most occupied ICU bed days compared with other centres in Australia. The first case of confirmed H1N1 Influenza was admitted to our unit on 8 July 2009 and to the end of September, there have been 20 confirmed cases and 13 suspected cases of H1N1 Influenza admitted to the ICU. The impact of the H1N1 pandemic on the ICU was tremendous. Bed capacity was increased to 23 beds and elective cardiothoracic surgery was cancelled to cope with the large influx of critically ill patients. The acuity of some H1N1 patients dictated that many were cared for by 2 RNs (i.e. those on ECMO) and this put great strain on the nursing and medical workforce such that many hours of overtime were worked to ensure that the patients were cared for safely.",

All persons entering the isolation unit were required to wash their hands and apply personal protective equipment (PPE) [gown, gloves and mask] prior to entering.

The patients within this unit were nursed in a reverse barrier manner. Suspected cases were placed in the isolation rooms until their status was confirmed.

The transcriptions were concomitantly analysed by a second investigator using the aforementioned method. The themes identified by each investigator were then discussed, revised and agreed upon by both investigators. Coliazzi's last step in data analysis is to return the findings to the participants to confirm that the findings are a true reflection of their experiences.

The importance of matching the high acuity of the patients with appropriately skilled staff is an important method to ensure the safe care of all ICU patients. It has been shown that nurse inexperience can adversely impact on the quality of care provided to critically ill patients (Morrison et al., 2001) and the contributing factors to such occurrences were all present during the recent pandemic \u2013 staff shortages, high unit activity and lower levels of supervision. Additionally, many staff were working a large amount of overtime during the pandemic and this has also been shown to increase both errors and near misses (Scott et al., 2006). However, the reality of the situation was that if the medical and nursing staff had not have worked the extra hours, it would not have been possible to staff the ICU. The nurse managers identified that in a future pandemic actions to minimise staffing problems would include limiting annual leave during this time and also booking contract or agency nursing staff in advance to cover the increased staffing needs of the ICU. It is essential to increase staffing levels during a pandemic period to assist in facilitating adherence to staffing protocols, to facilitate adequate meal breaks for staff and to assist bedside nursing staff in getting supplies and running blood tests. If safe to do so, the transfer of lower acuity patients to nearby ICUs should also be considered to reduce the burden on staff.",

Placing a wardsperson on duty overnight would facilitate the completion of essential cleaning duties which were difficult to complete during the busy daytime hours. There was no increase in wardsperson hours during the height of the pandemic despite requests from ICU management and this must be remedied in the event of a future pandemic. The importance of the wardsperson's role in the successful functioning of the ICU during a pandemic period must be recognised by hospital management and resources must be put in place to deal with the extra workload.",

Issues which were important to the staff while caring for these patients were: the wearing of PPE for long periods, while essential, was physically uncomfortable and difficult; adequate stocks of PPE must be ensured; good communication was crucial in ensuring the efficient dissemination of information particularly regarding infection control measures and the disease process; adequate staffing levels must be maintained and the increase in staffing levels must be anticipated; the education of staff in advanced therapies (such as ECMO) is of great importance in coping with the increased demands of the pandemic; and the care of these patients and their loved ones is physically and emotionally demanding. Recommendations for future pandemic planning which can be drawn from this study include the appointment of a dedicated infection control representative to provide information and support regarding infection control matters; the maintenance of effective communication channels is crucial and the appointment of a pandemic coordinator should be considered; and the increased staffing requirements across nursing, medical, allied health and ancillary staff to cope with the higher patient numbers and acuity must be anticipated and planned for. The findings of our study offer valuable insights into the frontline medical and nursing staffs\u2019 experiences of a pandemic and it is hoped they provide valuable information for health care professionals and policy makers to assist them in planning for future pandemic outbreaks.",
