We prove that the infectionfree equilibrium point is locally and globally asymptotically stable with condition R 0 < 1. We also prove that the positive equilibrium point is locally and globally asymptotically stable with condition R 0 > 1. Numerical simulations are employed to illustrate our results. In the absence of vaccines or antiviral drugs for the virus, our results suggest that the governments should strictly implement the isolation system to make every effort to curb propagation of disease during the epidemic.",

Compartment model is the base and also a powerful mathematical framework for understanding the complex dynamics of epidemics. At present, Many researchers [1] [2] [3] are increasingly interested in the influence of these behavioral factors on the spread of infectious diseases. Cooke and Driessche [4] proposed and investigated a classical SEIR epidemic model, which has became the most important model in diseases control. Therefore, ODEs, PDEs and SDEs are employed to study SEIR epidemic models, and some results could be found in literatures [5] [6] [7] [8] . Zhao et al. [9] investigated an extended SEIR epidemic model with non-communicability in incubation period. National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China declared that the incubation period of the COVID-19 is about ten days, the incubation period is infectious [10] . The COVID-19 outbreak in China presents that physical protection and social isolation are critical to controlling the epidemic in the absence of vaccines or antiviral drugs for the virus.",

We also have proved that if R 0 > 1, equilibrium point P * is locally and globally asymptotically stable. If it is assumed that S(0) = 100, E(0) = 15, I(0) = 20, \u039b = 10, \u03b2 = 0.2, \u03b8 2 = 0.1, \u00b5 = 0.3, \u03b4 = 0.3, \u03b3 = 0.2, \u03c3 = 0.2, we employ with computer aided techniques to obtain the threshold \u03b8 * 1 \u2248 0.85 of parameter \u03b8 1 (see (a) in Fig. 1. ). If we select \u03b8 1 = 0.7, the basic reproduction number of system (2.1)R 0 = 1.7619 > 1, it can be seen that the equilibrium point P * is globally asymptotically stable.(see (b) in Fig. 1.) . If we select l = 0.9, the basic reproduction number of system (2.1)R 0 = 0.5873 < 1, it can be seen that the equilibrium point P 0 is globally asymptotically stable.(see (c) in Fig. 1.) . The proofs and the numerical simulations are employed to illustrate that the strategies of the homestead-isolation on the susceptible are very important in the epidemics of infectious diseases. Our results suggest that the governments should strictly implement the isolation system to make every effort to curb propagation of disease. ",
