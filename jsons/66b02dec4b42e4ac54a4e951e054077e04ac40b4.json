In our transgender clinic, in Beijing, China, we found that difficulty in accessing hormone interventions was associated with high levels of anxiety and depression due to uncertainty about the availability of future treatments and struggles with maintaining unwanted gender identities during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

These assessments could identify transgender individuals at a high risk of developing severe psychological or physical health problems. Early screening could help to provide timely interventions for symptoms that occur during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we suggest that it is important to note that there are subgroup differences in transgender individuals' physical and mental health needs. After genderaffirming surgery, groups such as transgender women tend to have adverse outcomes of vaginoplasty, such as visceral injury, fistulas, vaginal prolapse, and pelvic floor disorders, which occur because of the complex nature of the gender reassignment and require long-term care after surgery. 5 During the COVID-19 pandemic, transgender women might therefore face additional difficulties compared with transgender men.",

Hormone intervention requires lifelong medical support as the concentration of hormones and adverse events need to be carefully monitored. 2 In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we suggest that governments, policy makers, and the private sector should actively consider the unprecedent difficulties and situation faced by transgender people when planning to address the healthcare crisis, and implement suitable strategies to help this minority group. Finally, it is important for healthcare systems to establish assessment screening and provide a monitoring service to ensure psychological wellbeing of this vulnerable population.",
