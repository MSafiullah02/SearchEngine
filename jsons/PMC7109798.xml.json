Bovine serum albumin was used in place of 293 cell nuclear protein extract as a negative control. The reaction mixtures underwent electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 1X TBE). After electrophoresis, the gel was vacuum-dried.

Genotyping of all subjects was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism as described, except with the use of different reverse primer [28]. The described forward primer (5'-TGAAGACCCCCAATTA-CCAA-3') was used with the reverse primer designed by us (5'-GAAACTCACAGACCCTGTGCTGA-3') for PCR using AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer's instruction and the following thermal cycle conditions: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 7 min, 35 subsequent cycles at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s, followed by a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. The PCR products were digested by either 1 U of HhaI or 2 U of PstI (GE Healthcare). The digested products were analyzed on 2% agarose gel (Figure 2). The size of the undigested product was 296-bp. The major -88G allele creates an HhaI restriction site (GCGC), which cleaves the 296-bp fragment into 260 bp and 36 bp, whereas the minor -88T allele is resistant to HhaI restriction. The major -123C allele creates a PstI site (CTGCAG), which cleaves the 296-bp fragment into 225 bp and 71 bp, whereas the minor -123A allele abolishes the PstI restriction site. Ten percent of all samples were duplicated to confirm the genotyping data. Control samples of known homozygous and heterozygous genotypes and no-template control were included in each run of PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism. The calling of genotypes on the basis of electrophoresis was blindly checked by 2 individual researchers independently.",

The binding of nuclear proteins to each hot probe was competed against a cold (unlabeled) probe of the same or the other allele in separate reactions. The upshifted band of the hot -88G probe in lanes 3 and 4 was not significantly diminished in intensity by competition with the cold -88G probe, whereas competition with the cold -88T probe decreased the band intensity in lanes 5- 6 in a dosage-dependent manner. Consistently, the upshifted band intensity of the hot -88T probe was diminished by competition with the cold -88T probe (lanes 9\u201310) but not by competition with the cold -88G probe (lanes 11\u201312). Because a stronger band intensity indicates stronger binding, these findings suggest that the binding affinity of the nuclear proteins to the -88T allele was slightly stronger than that to the -88G allele. Nevertheless, the decrease in band intensities by competition with either cold probe was weak, indicating that the binding of proteins to the probes was not specific or strong.",

Hamano et al [30] studied 44 SARS patients and 103 control subjects in Vietnam and found no significant association, whereas the He et al [31] Chinese Han cohort of 66 SARS patients and 64 control subjects suggested the -88GT heterozygous genotype was associated with increased susceptibility to SARS. Another IFN-inducible gene, OAS-1, was also studied on these same small population cohorts, and the +1295A>G [30, 31] and +590A>G SNPs [30] reported to be associated with SARS coronavirus infection. Our large-scale case-control analyses of the OAS-1 SNPs, however, found no significant association (Table 6). Interestingly, the confounding effect of these OAS-1 SNPs did not significantly alter the association of the -123C>A SNP, but rendered the association of -88G>T SNP insignificant (Table 7).",

The apparent association of -88T became insignificant after adjustment for the confounding effects of age, sex and the OAS-1 SNPs (Table 7). Because SARS coronavirus infection can suppress endogenous IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 induction [21\u201324], the -123C>A SNP probably exerts greater effect on basal MxA expression in innate immune response which can affect susceptibility to SARS.

This similarity between H5N1 influenza and SARS in the evasion of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 induction suggests that the -123C>A SNP may also be an important susceptibility factor for H5N1 infection, which warrants future study.",

In support of these in vitro findings, our large genetic association study provided in vivo data that confirm that, although both SNPs demonstrated significantly decreased susceptibility to SARS coronavirus infection, the association was clearly stronger for the -123C>A SNP. This is in keeping with the condition of suppression of endogenous IFN induction in the innate immune response against SARS coronavirus infection. Knowledge of these differences in contribution of these 2 MxA promoter SNPs in the innate immune response to infection would be important for the assessment of one's susceptibility to infectious diseases that may emerge in the future, especially those sharing a mode of action similar to that of SARS coronavirus.",

B , EMSA for the -88G>T SNP, using nuclear extracts from untreated 293 cells. Comparison of lanes 3 and 4 and lanes 5 and 6 showed that the -88T probe bound slightly stronger than did the -88G probe. Comparison between lanes 9 and 10 and lanes 11 and 12 also showed that the -88T probe bound slightly stronger (also shown in the bar chart). However, the intensity of the upshifted band was low, and the competition by cold probes was weak. C , EMSA for the -123C>A SNP, using nuclear extracts from untreated 293 cells. The presence of 2 upshifted bands suggested that there might be 11 transcription factor complexes binding to the probes. The stronger band intensity of the -123A probes and the stronger competition by the cold -123A probe suggest that the binding affinity of -123A allele is stronger than that of -123C. D , EMSA for -88G>T SNP, using nuclear extracts from IFN-\u03b2-treated 293 cells. There was an upshifted band of the -88T probe, which could be competed by the cold probe. However, the -88G probe was not upshifted. E , EMSA for the -123C>A SNP, using nuclear extracts from IFN-\u03b2-treated 293 cells. The upshift pattern of the probes is similar to that with untreated 293 cells nuclear extract, indicating that the binding affinity of the probe is not significantly affected by IFNb treatment.
