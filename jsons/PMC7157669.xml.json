A decade later in 2012, MERS-CoV caused a severe respiratory disease that emerged in the Middle East with 2494 confirmed human infection cases and 858 deaths [9]. In both epidemics, bats were identified as the original source of SARS and MERS-CoVs. The rate of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 appears higher than earlier outbreaks of CoVs via cough and/or sneezing droplets emitted from an infected person. SARS-CoV-2 has appeared more transmissible but less deadly than SARS-CoV. To date worldwide, 194,029 confirmed cases of human infection and 7873 deaths across 164 countries have been recorded [10].",

The high incidence of homologous RNA recombination is one of the most fascinating features of CoVs replication [11,12,13,14]. Kottier et al. reported the first experimental-based recombination evidence for avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [15], although additional studies have also concluded that IBV evolves through recombination [16,17,18,19,20,21]. Moreover, murine hepatitis virus (MHV) evolution through recombination was also practically confirmed [22]. This encouraged exploration of the probable role of recombination in the SARS-CoV emergence. The current condition might appear as a vulnerable factor for severe disease and may impose serious health threats to the human. Due to wide distribution with the increasing prevalence of CoVs, frequent genomes recombination, large genetic diversity and high human-animal interface behavior, CoVs might be emerged from time-to-time in humans due to occasional spillover and recurrent cross-species infectious events [7,23].",

To understand the genetic diversity relationship and potential origin of SARS-CoV-2 with the other members of coronavirinae, we have performed molecular phylogenetic analysis with a number of CoVs whole-genome sequences obtained from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (Table S1). The phylogenetic tree results demonstrate that all the CoVs responsible for the outbreak of concentrated pneumonia belong to the genera Betacoronavirus (Figure 2). All the SARS-CoV-2 clade grouped with the cluster of SARS/SARS-like CoVs, with bat CoVs HKU9-1, HKU9-2 HKU9-3 and HKU9-4 as an immediate ancestor (Figure 2). The interior shared neighbors include SARS-CoV NS-1, SARS-CoV Sino1-11, SARS-CoV GZ02 and SARS-CoV GD01, and they were the human-infecting CoVs (Figure 2). The whole genome-based phylogenetic analysis presented that two Bat SARS-like CoVs (ZXC21 and ZC45) were the closest relatives of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the inner and outer joint neighbors of SARS-CoV-2 were found to have bats as their natural reservoir including Bat SARS-CoV WIV1 in Rhinolophus sinicus, Bat SARS-CoV HKU3-1, and Bat CoV HKU9-3 in Rousettus bats. Consequently, the bat would be the convenient native host of SARS-CoV-2, thus the probable intermediate host for the transmission cascade used by SARS-CoV-2 from bats to humans would be the same as that used by other SARS-CoV.",

Two bat SARS-like CoVs (ZXC21 and ZC45) were the closest relatives of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2). Consequently, we found that the bat would be the convenient native host of SARS-CoV-2.

All the structural proteins were well conserved except for spike glycoprotein that showed a high rate of mutation in SARS-CoV-2 [30,31]. Our results demonstrated that compared with SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 shares ~81% amino acid similarity in spike (S) protein (Table 1, Figure 4), which represented less conserved patterns of S protein than other CoVs like HKU3-CoV [32]. Through deep receptor-binding domain (RBD) analysis of SARS-CoV (amino acids), the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was 73% preserved comparatively to the pandemic RBD (Figure S5). This conservation pattern of RBD placed the SARS-CoV-2 between HKU3-4 (62.7% conserved), a bat virus that was not capable of using the human ACE2 receptor, and the divergent bat CoV rSHC014 (80.8%), a spike known to use the human ACE2 receptor for entrance [29,33]. Moreover, the binding free energies for the S-protein to human ACE2 binding complexes were calculated and the binding free energy for the Wuhan-Hu-1-CoV S-protein increased by 28 kcal mol\u20131 when compared to the SARS-CoV S-protein binding, representing more binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor [34].",

Experimental investigation of Follis et al. with SARS-CoV demonstrated that furin cleavage site insertion at the S1-S2 junction increases cell-cell fusion [37]. Additionally, an effective cleavage site in the MERS-CoV spike motif empowers bat MERS-like CoVs to infect human cells [38]. On the other hand, in avian influenza viruses, quick replication and diffusion effectively acquired polybasic cleavage sites in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, which served a similar function to that of the coronavirus spike protein. In CoVs, insertion or recombination facilitates acquisition of transforming low-pathogenicity into highly pathogenic forms for polybasic cleavage sites [39]. So far sampled pangolin beta-corona viruses and the bat beta coronaviruses do not have polybasic cleavage sites. CoVs could have adopted a natural evolutionary mechanism to mutate and to attain the polybasic cleavage site because the virus must have both the mutations and polybasic cleavage site for appropriate human ACE2 receptor binding. For this purpose, it required a large population density for natural selection to attain an ACE2-encoding gene that is akin to the human ortholog [40,41]. The recent study of Peng et al. revealed that might it be possible that SARS-CoV-2 ancestors jumped into humans, getting the genetic features through adaptation and remaining undetected during human-to-human transmission. Once it adapted, these variations became pandemic and sufficiently produced a large number of cases to activate the immune system that identified it [40,41].",

            "text": "Usually viruses adopt different strategies including recombination, mutation and reassortment which facilitate the viruses in getting to equilibrium in the final host. Due to low fidelity of reverse transcriptase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RNA viruses are more vulnerable to point mutations even though the point mutation rates in RNA viruses are approximately 10\u22124 to 10\u22125 [42]. During the 2002 SARS-CoV epidemics, three mutations per RNA in each replication round were estimated (8.26 \u00d7 10\u22126 per nucleotide per day) [43]. Often, large population size and high rate of mutations in RNA viruses rapidly adjust genotypes allowing for quick adaptations in a rapidly changing environment. Respectively, mutations have a specific influence on virus reproductive fitness as positive selection drives to fix the positive fitness effects of beneficial alleles, while negative selection removes lethal and deleterious alleles from a population. Together with these selective approaches, the evolutionary routes of virus populations can be figured out across a sequence space [34]. Examining the genetic insight of SARS and Wuhan-Hu-1-CoV presented more than 90% sequence conservation between the E, M and N protein with few numbers of point mutations (Table 1), whereas the higher rate of mutations in the S protein of Wuhan-Hu-1-CoV were also observed and shared ~81% identity (Table 1, Figure 4A). These results were in accordance with the results of Xu et al. and Pradhan et al. [44,45].",

            "text": "Recombination and reassortment became a powerful tool of emerging viruses to get innovative antigenic combinations that might aid the course of cross-species diffusion. The recombination strategy facilitates this mechanism to find a better fraction of sequence space than the mutation, raising the probability of finding a genetic configuration which supports host adaptations [46]. It is important to note that numerous recently emerged RNA viruses which were involved in human diseases exhibited active recombination or reassortment events. Mostly RNA viruses get entry into the new host through the cross-species transmission [47]. The recombination events in viruses are in fact related to discontinuous utilization of RNA polymerase involved in the transcriptional mechanism to make mRNAs. RNA polymerase of viruses must use different RNA prototypes while making negative or positive RNA strands that eventually result in RNA recombination that is either homologous or non-homologous [12]. In RNA viruses, this model of recombination is called the copy-choice model of recombination [13,14]. In CoVs, a high recombination rate has been reported [48]. It might be due to having large genome size, discontinuous transcription, and sub- or fully transcriptionally active genomic length of RNA. The co-infection of two CoVs in same animal or cells can potentially facilitate crossing over. In the recent past, the emergence of new infectious bronchitis virus recombinant (IBV), a new type of CoV in turkeys, was reported. The genome sequence revealed that the S protein gene of this virus was the recombinant of another CoVs [49]. In the S protein, the recombination event is certainly significant as it permits the virus to modify superficial antigenicity to get from the immune reconnaissance into the animals, and then adapt to a human host. We identified nine putative recombination patterns, which encompass, in terms of genes involved, the spike glycoprotein, RdRp, helicase and ORF3a. Six of the nine recombination regions were spotted in the S gene (Table 2). Significantly, in this study each of the recombinant regions were predicted with at least two methods (Table 2) according to the method of Posada. He recommended that one should not be dependent on a single method [50]. These results were in agreement with previous reports where the recombinant event was reported between parent viruses in the avian-like and mammalian-like SARS-CoV evolution [51,52].",

All the sequences were aligned by using MAFFT (V 7.452) online server [53]. To determine the nucleotides substitution model, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) value for aligned sequences was determined using jModel Test 2 and the substitution model with minimum BIC values was considered for phylogenetic inference (Table S2) [54]. The whole-genome sequence was considered as a single partition, and three chains of Bayesian analysis were performed by applying the GTR+I+G model of substitution. Reaching the maximum allowed number of generations after discarding burin (270030000), the optimal analyses trees were pooled into a single tree file. Posterior probability values with majority consensus rule were visualized. Figure 3 was used to visualize the best tree and the likelihood phylogram was exported as a picture [55]. Multalin software was used to align and visualized the envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike glycoprotein regions of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [56]. The amino acid conservation motifs of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 genome were traced by performing MUSCLE alignment using MEGAX software. The three-dimensional structures of spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV were generated by using an online server Protein Homology/analogY Recognition Engine V 2.0 (Phyre2) [57] and the structure was visualized and marked by using PyMol [58]. To detect the recombination events, whole-genome nucleotide sequences of seven viral strains (Wuhan-Hu-1-CoV; Bat SARS-like including W1V1, ZXC21, ZC45; Bat SARS GZ02, RF1 and MERS) were aligned using ClustalW. Preliminarily, MaxChi and Chimaera algorithms were used to detect the recombination events in the dataset by a recombination detection program (RDP5) [59]. Additionally, bootscan analyses and similarity plots were performed using Simplot 3.5.1 [60] to confirm the RDP-suggested potential recombination events and were analyzed on the whole-genome sequence of Wuhan as a query and Bat SARS-like, SARS and MERS as potential parental sequences (Table S1). A PHI statistical test was applied to evaluate the significance of recombination evidence between closely and distantly related genomes. Furthermore, the point of recombination along with major and minor parents of the recombinant was accessed through RDP, Bootscan, MaxChi, Chimaera and 3Seq methods [59].",
