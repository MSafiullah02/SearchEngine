            "text": "Introduction: Antibiotic treatment failure contributes to the economic and humanistic burdens of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) by increasing morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. This study compared treatment failure rates of levofloxacin with those of other antibiotics in a large US sample. Methods: Medical and pharmacy claims in the nationally representative SDI database were used to identify adults with a new outpatient diagnosis of CAP receiving a study antibiotic (levofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, azithromycin, moxifloxacin) between September 1, 2005 and March 31, 2008. Treatment failure was defined as \u22651 of the following events \u226430 days after index date: a refill for the index antibiotic after completed days of therapy, a different antibiotic dispensed >1 day after the index prescription, or hospitalization with a pneumonia diagnosis or emergency department visit >3 days postindex. Cohorts were propensity score matched for demographic and clinical characteristics. Treatment failure rates were compared between pairs of cohorts for the full sample and for highrisk patients (age \u226565 and/or on Medicaid). Results: Among the 3994 study patients, the numbers of dispensed index prescriptions were 268 for amoxicillin/clavulanate, 1609 for azithromycin, 1460 for levofloxacin, and 657 for moxifloxacin. Unadjusted treatment failure rates for the sample were 20.8% for levofloxacin, 23.9% for amoxicillin/clavulanate, 23.9% for azithromycin, and 19.9% for moxifloxacin. For high-risk patients, unadjusted treatment failure rates were 19.1% for levofloxacin, 26.1% for amoxicillin/clavulanate, 26.3% for azithromycin, and 24.3% for moxifloxacin. Propensity score-matched treatment failure rates were significantly lower with levofloxacin than azithromycin (19.8% vs. 24.5%, odds ratio [OR] comparator vs. levofloxacin 1.38; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.67), a difference amplified in high-risk patients (19.0% vs. 26.4%, OR 1.61; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.13). 11 743 744 Adv Ther (2010) 27(10):743-755. No significant differences were observed for other paired comparisons. Conclusion: In a large US sample, treatment failure in CAP appeared to be less likely with quinolones (such as levofloxacin)",

Moreover, the incidence of CAP-related emergency department visits was 22% lower among levofloxacin-treated patients than macrolide-treated patients although significant differences were not observed for CAP-related hospitalizations or total CAP-related healthcare costs. In that study, 15 as in the current study, benefits of levofloxacin were particularly marked in patients aged \u226565 years. Whereas levofloxacin was associated with a 16% lower risk of treatment failure than macrolides in the sample as a whole, levofloxacin was associated with a 35% lower risk of treatment failure in patients aged \u226565 The reason for the lower treatment failure rates with levofloxacin compared with azithromycin (and with macrolides generally in the study reported above) 15 In the current study, the benefit of levofloxacin over azithromycin with respect to treatment failure was manifested both in the unadjusted data and in the propensity score- show that levofloxacin was associated with a significantly lower rate of treatment failure than azithromycin in both the sample as a whole and a high-risk subset of patients who were \u226565 years old and/or on Medicaid.",

Rates of treatment failure with levofloxacin (reference fluoroquinolone) were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin, the macrolide azithromycin, and the penicillin amoxicillin/ clavulanate, based on analysis of claims from large, nationally representative US medical and pharmacy databases.",

In analyses involving propensity score-matched data, the odds of treatment failure were 38% greater with azithromycin than levofloxacin. The benefit of levofloxacin over azithromycin with respect to treatment failure was particularly marked in high-risk patients (ie, those \u226565 years old and/or on Medicaid), among whom the odds of treatment failure were 61% greater with azithromycin than levofloxacin. Treatment failure rates were lower with levofloxacin than azithromycin in the sample as a whole and in high-risk patients despite the older age, on average, of the levofloxacin cohort and the tendency of the levofloxacin cohort to have a greater comorbidity burden.These findings are consistent with the previous observation that initial treatment of CAP with fluoroquinolones, compared with other guidelines-concordant antibiotics, is linked to a reduced risk of treatment failure. 10,11",

Propensity score matching reduces the likelihood of imbalances among cohorts in pretreatment characteristics in an observational study. Balancing of cohorts using the propensity score-matching technique is achieved by matching patients by their likelihood of receiving full sample, and versus both amoxicillin/ clavulanate and moxifloxacin among highrisk patients. The small size of the amoxicillin/ clavulanate cohort, in particular, might have allowed for the operation of type II error that obscured treatment-related differences. Additional research with larger samples is warranted to further compare treatment failure rates among these antibiotics. The results of the study should be interpreted in the context of its limitations. First, the definition of treatment failure might have led to inflation of the treatment failure rate. Treatment failure could entail a refill of the index antibiotic dispensed after the completed days of therapy or a different antibiotic dispensed >1 day after the index antibiotic prescription. The diagnosis for which the second prescription was made was not obtained from pharmacy claims, and the second prescription could have been for the treatment of a condition other than CAP. However, any inflation of treatment failure rates because of the misattribution of diagnoses for the second prescription would be expected to affect the treatment cohorts similarly and therefore should not have affected the pattern of results. Other limitations of the study include the possibility of data entry errors in claims originating at the site of care and the inability to account for out-of-network care. Finally, the retrospective, observational nature of the study makes the results subject to selection bias. Attempts to minimize the potential impact of selection bias included the application of restrictive inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the use of multivariate analyses with the propensity score-matched data. CONCLUSION Its limitations notwithstanding, the study provides new information about treatment failure rates associated with antibiotics commonly prescribed for CAP. The results",
