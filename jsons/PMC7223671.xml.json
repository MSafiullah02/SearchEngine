OHA aims to be the national leader for research, education, and advocacy on health hazards at the human-animal-environmental interface, and to be the prime point of contact in New Zealand for engagement and collaboration in One Health. OHA is not simply a national One Health society, committee or interest group. The intention is to create a genuine culture change with the embedding of transdisciplinary thinking and action among researchers at a national level, running parallel with an indigenous worldview and with intrinsic and direct links to effective policy-making. We believe this initiative is novel globally because of these characteristics.",

Quarantine measures were implemented early during the period of European colonisation to protect public health and the agricultural sector. Today, New Zealand\u2019s biosecurity laws remain some of the strictest globally [3]. Consequently, New Zealand has relatively low rates of certain infections (e.g. bovine brucellosis has been eliminated and Q fever has never been reported), has the presence of strains rarely found elsewhere that arrived in the country many decades ago and have been evolving in isolation (e.g. Campylobacter [4] and Shiga toxin\u2013producing Escherichia coli [5]), and experiences delayed impact of many infectious diseases from overseas [3]. One benefit of being a relatively \u201cclosed system\u201d for some food and agricultural products is that the impact of health interventions can be evaluated in a more rigorous way that would not otherwise be possible. For example, campylobacteriosis rates were halved following an intervention that lowered contamination of fresh poultry [6\u20138].",

            "text": "Another defining characteristic of New Zealand is our strong economic reliance on agriculture, unusual among developed nations. New Zealand is experiencing some of the highest global rates of agricultural intensification [17], with implications for water quality and disease profile. While the global biomass ration of livestock to humans is ~ 2:1 [18], in New Zealand it is ~ 25:1 [19]. Agricultural intensification has been linked to water contamination [20], which has been associated with New Zealand\u2019s high rates of zoonotic enteric disease [21]. Zoonoses associated with direct animal contact, such as Salmonella Brandenburg [22] and leptospirosis [23, 24], disproportionately affect farmers and meat workers, and people living in rural areas with large cattle populations are more likely to be infected with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli [25]. There is growing concern over the deteriorating quality of New Zealand\u2019s natural environment, particularly fresh water quality [26]. Routes of transmission to humans via contaminated water include through irrigation of food crops, recreational activities, M\u0101ori customary resources, consumption of contaminated shellfish, as well as through drinking water. New Zealand\u2019s disease profile at the human-animal-environmental interface is, therefore, likely to be different from many developed countries, characterised both by the need to deal with internal challenges and to resist external pressures from overseas. There is growing global focus on the health and environmental impacts of food production systems [27]. It is a challenge for a country that is so highly reliant on a narrow agricultural base to transition to a more sustainable and low risk agricultural system. Informing this transition may benefit from use of new, more comprehensive metrics that consider wider health, social, environmental, and economic impacts [28].",

New Zealand\u2019s modest population of 4.9 million makes connecting with researchers, communities, and policy-makers relatively easy, while the centralised government system means fewer layers of bureaucracy to work through. Consequently, scientific research is relatively unified nationally, and standardised country-level interventions can be created, such as the New Zealand Antimicrobial Resistance Action Plan [29]. Examples of streamlined services include a national veterinary laboratory (The Animal Health Laboratory) and a centralised surveillance system for notifiable diseases (EpiSurv). The New Zealand Microbiology Network connects all clinical diagnostic microbiology laboratories across the country and facilitated nationwide initiatives with relative ease, such as a national surveillance study for Legionnaires\u2019 disease [30]. New Zealand has a strong international reputation in biosecurity and food safety, and in 2016 established the New Zealand Food Safety Science and Research Centre as a nationwide partnership between government, the food industry and research organisations [31]. More broadly, the establishment of alliances across the health sector in parts of New Zealand has resulted in some of the most highly integrated health systems in the world [32].",

A strong emphasis of OHA has been on facilitating the interactions of people from diverse disciplines and knowledges, linked to high-level engagement with policy-makers, government operational agencies, and funders. The intention is to use a more holistic and integrative systems-thinking approach to develop carefully targeted research questions and setting research priorities within an integrated framework.

Likewise, integration of indigenous knowledge into environmental planning and decision making has been a core component of the management of water catchments in New Zealand [34, 35].",

The value of a One Health alliance is becoming increasingly recognised to researchers working within narrow subject areas as they grapple with a growing myriad of health, environmental and sustainability challenges. These challenges demand new ways of collaboration across boundaries and knowledges to define research priorities and find solutions that can achieve outcomes locally, nationally and internationally.",
