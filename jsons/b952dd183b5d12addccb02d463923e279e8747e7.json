The patients with rheumatic immune diseases have immune dysfunction and are often on glucocorticoid and immunosuppressant therapy, which in turn predispose them to an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Few studies have described the concomitant presence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases.

The diagnosis of COVID-19 was as per the criteria recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control (CDC), which included a positive real-time reverse transcription PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 (rRT-Chuanfang Cheng and Chuanjing Li contributed equally to this work. PCR) [4] . The characteristics of the 5 patients are presented in Table 1 . The patients were aged between 51 and 79 years, and included 4 females diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 1 male diagnosed with systemic sclerosis (SSc). Of the 5 patients, 2 had a history of close contact with COVID-19 patient. Moreover, out of the 5 patients, 3 had a concomitant presence of hypertension and pulmonary diseases (old tuberculosis and bronchiectasis (n = 1), chronic bronchitis (n = 1), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 1)). Amongst these patients, the most frequently observed symptom was fever (4/5), and cough (4/5) followed by dyspnea (2/5), and fatigue (1/5). None of the patients had diarrhea. On laboratory investigations, 2 patients had leukopenia and lymphopenia. The levels of CRP were raised in 3 patients (> 3 mg/L), while the PCT was normal in all the patients (0-0.05 ng/mL). Due to the increased disease severity, the levels of IL-6 (0.1-2.9 pg/ mL) and IL-10 (0.1-5 pg/mL) were found to be raised in 3 and 2 patients, respectively. Chest computerized tomography (CT) revealed a patchy ground glass opacity in the lungs of all the patients. In the later stage, it revealed a strip shadow. In the patient with SSc, chest CT revealed a grid shadow, which may be related to the interstitial pneumonia, as shown in Fig. 1 .",

Amongst them, four patients were given antibacterial therapy, including Levofloxacin, Moxifloxacin, Ceftriaxone, Piperacillin-Tazobactam, and Meropenem. During the hospital stay, the condition of two female patients remained the same (i.e., mild COVID-19). However, other two female patients progressed to the severe COVID-19, and the male patient worsened to the critical COVID-19. After 3 days of noninvasive ventilator treatment, the critically ill male patient was treated with high-flow oxygen inhalation and was also prescribed Methylprednisolone (40 mg/day, 5 days) combined with intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg, 10 g/day, 3 days). After 14-31 days of hospitalization, all the patients recovered well. In all the patients, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test was performed twice and was found to be negative, and thus, the n (%), where n is the total number of patients with available data patients were discharged from the hospital. Moreover, all the patients were isolated at home for 2 weeks without obvious discomfort, except the 2th patient, who complained of chest pain on deep breathing and followed the doctor's instructions for functional exercise now.",

In this case report, we present 5 cases of COVID-19 with concomitant presence of rheumatic immune diseases, thus accounting for 0.88% of the total confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted in our hospital, which may underestimate the incidence of rheumatic diseases in patients with COVID-19. It may be related to the omission on the part of the medical staff during the process of history taking. Various studies have reported that the overall incidence rate of COVID-19 is higher in males than in females (58.1% vs 41.9%) [6] , which may be related to differences in innate immunity and sex hormones. However, in this case report, 4 patients were female, accounting for 80% of the cases and this may be related to the high incidence of RA in females. Amongst the five patients, the severity of COVID-19 was mild and severe in two patients each, and critical in one patient. Thus, the proportion of patients with severe and critical COVID-19 was 60%, and two of them were complicated by the baseline pulmonary diseases. One of the RA patients was treated with Methotrexate during the entire period of hospitalization, and her condition remained stable. According to a study, coadministration of Methotrexate and Hydroxychloroquine did not result in an increased risk of hospitalization due to infection [7] . In the present report, a 79-year-old male patient with SSc progressed to critical COVID-19, and this may be explained by The texture of both lungs is disordered, the transparency is increased, some of them have reticular changes, multiple patchy ground glass density shadow and fuzzy edge are seen in both lungs. c, d 18 days after the symptom onset: Similar findings as a and b, however, with a few patchy and thin shadows, which are significantly smaller than the previous old age, low immune function, corticosteroid therapy, and concomitant presence of baseline diseases [8, 9] . Prior to the hospitalization, this patient was not diagnosed as a case of interstitial pneumonia. However, during hospitalization, his repeated chest CT examination revealed the change of grid shadow, thus suggestive of interstitial pneumonia. This may be related to the alveolar injury that occur in patients with severe or critical COVID-19, or SSc with prior interstitial pneumonia [10] . While, the other two RA patients, who had discontinued their medication, progressed to severe COVID-19. This suggests that drug withdrawal may be a risk factor for disease progression, if the disease has not been stable over a long period.",
