An R/I ratio of 1.0 suggests a high likelihood of recruitment, as the volume will be distributed similarly to the recruited lung and the baby lung. This method can be performed at the bedside and requires only a single-breath maneuver on any ventilator. This maneuver is particularly useful in conditions of high risk of virus transmission by disconnection, transport, or complex procedures. The clinicians in Wuhan decided to use this measure of recruitment in a systematic way in a series of patients with SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS, and also to assess the effect of body positioning.",

Written informed consent was waived owing to the observational design of the study and the urgent need to collect data for this infectious disease. The clinical charts of adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the ICU were reviewed. The patients received invasive mechanical ventilation and met the criteria for ARDS (Berlin definition) (5), were under continuous infusion of sedatives, and were assessed for respiratory mechanics, including lung recruitability, during the week of February 18, 2020. This week (a 6-d observational window) was selected in order for the clinical team to record these additional measurements in the chart.",

Prone positioning was performed over periods of 24 hours when Pa O 2 /FI O 2 was persistently lower than 150 mm Hg. Flow, volume, and airway pressure were measured by ventilators (SV300; Mindray). Circuit leakage was excluded through a 6-second end-inspiratory occlusion. Measurements were performed at clinically set PEEP levels and were repeated every morning during the observation days, when possible. Total PEEP and plateau pressure were measured by a short end-expiratory and an end-inspiratory occlusion, respectively. Complete airway closure was assessed by performing a low-flow (6 L/min) inflation and by comparing patients' compliance with circuit compliance as previously described (6) . The potential for lung recruitment was assessed by means of the R/I ratio (4), which can be calculated automatically from a webpage (https://crec.coemv.ca). Because of the limited access to computers or the internet while under airborne precautions, one of the authors (L.C.) provided a compact form for calculating the R/I ratio manually.

Although we were not able to compare the recruitability measured by the R/I ratio with that assessed by another technique (e.g., computed tomography), the low R/I ratio at Day 1 seemed consistent with the clinical impression of the clinicians. Of note, these patients had received various durations of noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and it would have been ideal to obtain these measurements as soon as the patients were intubated.

Each patient is indicated by a distinct color. (A) Five patients who did not receive prone positioning. Each triangle denotes a measurement in the supine position. (B) Seven patients who received at least one session of prone positioning. Each upside-down triangle denotes a measurement in the prone position. Notice that each session of prone positioning was maintained for 24 hours. The dashed line represents the cutoff of the R/I ratio for defining lung recruitability (R/I ratio > 0.5 suggests highly recruitable).",
