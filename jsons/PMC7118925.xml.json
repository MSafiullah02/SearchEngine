SARS was controlled at last, but many challenges will remain for HVAC engineers: What can people do to prevent the pollutions of the indoor air by fatal pollutants such as SARS virus? The mechanism of the spread of SARS virus is complicated and still remains a mystery. However, it is believed that increased fresh air ventilation is helpful in decreasing the possibility of being infected by the disease.",

This is because the relative humidity in a occupied building must be controlled to within 40\u201360% for health and comfort. Ventilation air is the major source of moisture load in air conditioning. As shown in Fig. 1\nfor a moisture load estimation of a medium size retail store [1], ventilation air constitutes about 68% of the total moisture load in most commercial buildings. As a consequence, treatment of the latent load from the ventilation air is a difficult and imminent task for HVAC engineers, especially in hot and humid climates like South China.",

A schematic of the method and the processes in a psychrometric chart are shown in Fig. 2\n. Ambient air is mixed with return air first. Then the mixed air (state 2) flows through an AHU (air handling units) where it is cooled and dehumidified. It should be mentioned that to remove moisture, all the air must be cooled to below its dew point at state 3, (around 15 \u00b0C). Air at this temperature could not be directly supplied to room, to prevent cold-drafts and over-cooling that would cause discomfort to occupants. As a result, supply air is subsequently reheated by a heating coil to state 4 before distributed into the conditioned space. Because air is not only for ventilation, but also a heat transfer medium, and a large quantity of air is needed to extract the sensible load, energy requirements are very high. Another problem with this technique is that in transition seasons, when it is at part load conditions, humidity control will be lost [3].",

According to this concept, the latent load of a room is treated by an independent humidity control system, while the sensible load is treated with some other alternative cooling techniques such as chilled-ceiling panels, or phase-change materials [4], [5], [6]. Since, the circulating air is dramatically reduced, energy consumption can be reduced substantially. Another benefit is that chilled water or suction temperatures can be raised, resulting in increased equipment efficiency and decreased operating costs. It is estimated that with a new system of chilled-ceiling panels combined with independent humidity control, 30% of energy could be saved in comparison to a traditional coupled system [7], [8], [9]. Nevertheless, due to the hot and humid climates in south China, energy for moisture control with an independent humidity control system still accounts for 25% of the total energy for air conditioning. To further reduce the energy consumption in the treatment of fresh air, energy recovery measures must be combined to an independent humidity control system.",

The air dehumidification systems are operated when the offices is opened, i.e. from 9:00 to 18:00. At nights, the systems are shut down, to save energy. The air flow rates are selected according to ASHRAE Standard 62-1999 [10], which is determined by several factors such as room area, building occupancy pattern, and building types. The sensible load of the room is treated by chilled-ceiling panels. The total ventilation load includes two fractions: moisture load from fresh air and moisture load from human activities. The fresh air sensible and latent load is a variable relating to weather conditions, while the load from human activities is assumed to be kept at 50 g/h.",

First, fresh air is pre-cooled and partially dried by the mechanical dehumidifier. Then the air is dried more deeply and also reheated by the desiccant wheel. This arrangement uses both technologies at favorable points of performance. At higher inlet humidities, the mechanical refrigeration system can operate at a higher coil temperature and suction pressure, thereby saving energy. Dehumidified air from a desiccant wheel is very hot. Therefore, before it is supplied to rooms, it should be cooled down to set points first. To recover the energy from exhaust air, an evaporative cooler is used to cool down the exhaust air, which is then used to cool the supply air from desiccant wheel. Under extremely humid ambient conditions, energy required for re-activation exceeds available heat from the heat pump. In such cases, an auxiliary electric heater is used to accomplish the regeneration of the desiccant wheel. This system is relatively complex due to the rotating character of the wheel and the reactivation of the desiccants. If low grade waste heat is available, the desiccant wheel system becomes superior to other systems in energy efficiency (Fig. 6\n).",
