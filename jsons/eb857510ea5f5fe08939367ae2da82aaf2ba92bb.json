            "text": "Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne disease, caused by the member of the Togaviridae family belongs to the genus alphavirus, making it a major threat in all developing countries as well as some developed countries. The mosquito acts as a vector for the disease and carries the CHIK-Virus. To date there is no direct treatment available and that demands the development of more effective vaccines. In this study author employed Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource, a machine learningbased algorithm principally working on the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm, also known as (IEDB-ANN) for the prediction and analysis of Epitopes. A total of 173 epitopes were identified on the basis of IC50 values, among them 40 epitopes were found, sharing part with the linear B-cell epitopes and exposed to the cTAP1protein, and out of 40, 6 epitopes were noticed to show interactions with the cTAP with their binding energy ranging from \u2212 3.61 to \u2212 1.22 kcal/mol. The six epitopes identified were exposed to the HLA class I alleles and from this all revealed interaction with the HLA alleles and minimum binding energy that ranges from \u2212 4.12 to \u2212 5.88 kcal/mol. Besides, two T cell epitopes i.e. 145 KVFTGVYPE 153 and 395 STVPVAPPR 403 were found most promiscuous candidates. These promiscuous epitopes-HLA complexes were further analyzed by the molecular dynamics simulation to check the stability of the complex. Results obtained from this study suggest that the identified epitopes i.e. and 395 STVPVAPPR 403 , are likely to be capable of passing through the lumen of ER to bind withthe HLA class I allele and provide new insights and potential application in the designing and development of peptide-based vaccine candidate for the treatment of chikungunya.",

This massive outbreak that occurred in India in the year of 2016, affecting millions of people. The positive rate of the CHIKV virus was approximately 70% among them 97% of patients were suffering from severe joint pains and restriction in movements (Kaur et al. 2017) . The burden of chikungunya infection increases day by day, the reason behind that is, the vector for CHIKV and dengue are similar in some ways, which leads to confusion in the treatment plans. Most of dengue negative patients were analyzed under the chikungunya infection test and were found chikungunya positive (Dutta et al. 2017) . Another reason for the increasing burden of this infection load is the unavailability of the treatment or a proper vaccination. Even though various scientific groups are working independently in order to design a vaccine for this infectious disease, but still there isn't any treatment or vaccination available (Powers 2017) .",

The energy graph explains that at the beginning of the MD simulation, there were lots of fluctuations present and the molecule was looking for the constant energy point, but with the progression of the MD simulations, it was found that energy was continuously increasing and it got stable approx. the 300 kcal/mol and it stops stepping up and goes the steady-state.

This research work started with the prediction of the nanomeric T cell epitopes by using the immune epitope database. The ANN (Artificial Neural Network) algorithm of the IEDB database was used. Epitopes with IC50 values below 50 nM were selected. Only two of the T cell epitopes among all identified epitopes were found highly conserved, they also share the part with the B cell linear epitope and they show good binding energy with the cTAP1 and HLA class I allele. The predicted epitopes show the good binding with the TAP molecule which infers the movement of the peptides through the lumen of RER (Rough endoplasmic reticulum) with help of TAP protein to bind with the MHC class I allele. To understand the structural analysis, the modeled epitopes were docked with cTAP1 protein and HLA class I alleles using the AutoDock 4.2. In this study author had performed docking studies with the downloaded structure of HLA-A*02:06 (PDB ID:3OXR) from PDB database and the obtained energy value are not good in comparison to the modelled structure. The obtained binding energy with the PDB structure was 3.24 kcal/mol while the obtained binding energy with the modelled structure was 4.53 kcal/ Fig. 3 The Ramachandran plot of the modelled structure generated by the SAVES server topredict the stability of the modelled structure of protein molecules. a The modelled protein structure of HLA-A*02:06 has 93.4% amino acid residue in the favored region while 0.0% amino acid residue falls in the disallowed region. b The modelled protein structure of HLA-A*31:01 has 93.0% amino acid residue in the favored region while 0.0% amino acid residue falls in the disallowed region mol. Due to good binding energy the modelled structure was preferred over the PDB structure. The scoring function (Rizvi et al. 2013 ) of the AutoDock 4.2 makes it more reliable for studying the molecular behavior and its interaction with the ligand molecule and it found that KVFTGVYPE and STVPVAPPR were highly conserved.",

Researchhad been documented, supports the immunoinformatics approach for predicting the best and most promiscuous epitopes or antigenic determinant for the purpose of designing vaccine candidate in-silico to overcome the burden of viral infections (Sharma et al. 2016) . Though in-silico studies are playing major role in the recent days' research. The cost effectiveness and rapidity in obtaining the result make in-silico studies an important asset in the today's research. Even though these advantages are there with the in-silico studies, there are certain limitations. The result obtained from the in-silico studies could not be directly employed in the real world, the obtained results must be tested in the laboratory before implementing to the real world. Another disadvantage of insilico studies is that the result is based on the tools/methods used, so there is possibility that the obtained result might get vary and produced ambiguity among the obtained results. The reliability of the tools is the main concern in the field of in-silico studies, if tools are not statistically tested, the obtained result could not be believed to be reliable. So, in in-silico studies selection of tools with the reliable algorithm is very much important. Similarly, this study identified the promiscuous T cell epitopes which could be analyzed and tested in the laboratory as vaccine candidates for designing the vaccine for chikungunya.",
