Full genome characterization efforts highlight how critical it is to understand at a molecular level all of the protein products from multiple organisms. An important issue for addressing the molecular characterization challenge is the need to quickly and economically characterize normal and diseased biological processes in order to understand the basic biology and chemistry of the systems and to facilitate the discovery and development of new therapeutic and diagnostic protocols. In order to fully characterize the proteins at the molecular level, three-dimensional protein structure determination has proven to be invaluable, complementing biological and biochemical information from other types of experiments. Structural information is also the ultimate rational drug design tool, with the potential to save an estimated 50% of the cost of drug discovery (Stevens 2004) . However, the best means by which to attain structural knowledge is a topic of controversy. The traditional approach was a complex and labor-intensive process in which one protein or complex was studied at a time. The alternative is a high throughput (HT), discovery-oriented approach wherein entire families, pathways or genomes are characterized. Benefits include the economy of scale, the speed of mass production, and a dramatic increase in discovery rates through the systematic collection and analysis of data.

A part of this coordinated target selection management is the focus on biomedically relevant protein structures. In addition to the four production centers, six technology development centers have been created to continue the development of innovative technologies for the more challenging problems including studies on membrane proteins, large protein assemblies, and the more difficult eukaryotic proteins. deposition of solved structures in the PDB. Both single crystal X-ray diffraction and solution NMR structural determination approaches were used. Only distinct target sequences are taken into account for each center and in the total count (hence numbers of \"distinct\" targets reported for centers where sequences are duplicated or missing in XML files may be lower than those reported by the centers; note also that the number of targets in the total count may be less than the sum of targets for the centers due to target overlaps). HT pipelines employed a manufacturing style approach in that responsibilities were compartmentalized by function and processes were standardized through the use of quality assurance practices such as standard operating procedures (SOP). Whenever possible, common quality control practices were employed to monitor processes and materials from beginning to end. Data was uploaded to a common database to facilitate target management, process monitoring, and regular reporting. Laboratory information management systems (Zolnai et al 2003; Bertone et al 2001) were used to manage and track experiments. A good example is the javabased SESAME system developed by the CESG group in Wisconsin. As all the projects were run as multi-institutional collaborations, specific pipeline processes were implemented in separate institutions. For example, in the case of the JCSG, steps from protein production to crystallization as well as crystal mounting were carried out at TSRI and GNF, while diffraction screening and data collection were done at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL).

The CLS is a breakthrough technology that offers the possibility of a \"synchrotron beamline\" for home laboratory applications. This tunable, tabletop X-ray source can be used in much the same way as a typical X-ray beamline at a large facility; but it is small enough to bring state-of-the-art methods of macromolecular crystallography directly into an experimenter's local laboratory. (Muchmore et al 2000; Markley et al 2003; W\u00fcthrich 2003) . Since NMR spectroscopy has intrinsically low sensitivity, milligram amounts of protein are required for screening and structure determination with conventional equipment. At the beginning of PSI-1 in 2000, about 6 weeks of NMR instrument time per protein structure was considered to be a realistic estimate for ~1 mM protein samples with molecular weights up to 15 kDa. By 2005, the start of PSI-2, NMR had been successfully transformed. It is now being used for HT structural determination efforts as well as for screening protein samples to determine suitability for crystal structural studies. A total of 123 structures were determined by NMR in PSI-1 of which 91 were done at the NESG. Microcoil NMR probes had been developed for use in biomolecular NMR spectroscopy (Olson et al 1995; Peti et al 2004) . Specifically, small diameter coils enable up to ten-fold (massbased) sensitivity gain so that microgram amounts of protein are now sufficient for screening by NMR spectroscopy. At the JCSG, by the 4th year of operations, most samples were being screened for the folded state with the microcoil probe before undergoing crystallization studies and assigned a grade of A, B, C, or D (Table 1- 4; Page et al 2005) . Using the microcoil probe, such information could be collected with 5 \u03bcL of protein and in 5 minutes. At this time, miniaturization is primarily aimed at identifying promising targets for structure determination. This methodology effectively guides efforts to focus on targets with a high probability of success, and either eliminates poor targets or replaces them by improved constructs. Overall, this process increases the efficiency of the entire pipeline and results in a reduction of the cost per structure. Further developments including optimized miniaturization may, at least for some proteins, lead the way directly to structure determination . In addition to the miniaturization efforts for NMR, cryogenic probes were evolving and becoming more robust and useful, offering approximately a 3-fold increase in sensitivity in routine applications in biological NMR spectroscopy (Monleon et al 2002) , and potentially an order-of-magnitude reduction in measurement times. The use of this probe has led to the development of G-matrix Fourier Transform (GFT) NMR by the NESG Center which enables researchers to optimally adjust NMR measurement times to sensitivity requirements and allows them to take full advantage of a The classification into four grades, 'A' to 'D', by 1D 1 H NMR screening is described in the published manuscript by .

This led to the establishment of a set of core screening conditions that provided an estimate of a protein's compatibility with tier 2 of the crystallomics core pipeline. It should be noted that the more extensively purified SeMet proteins tended to crystallize under different conditions than their less pure tier 1 counterparts and hence, tier 2 screening maintained its more aggressive wide-sampling of crystallization space.
