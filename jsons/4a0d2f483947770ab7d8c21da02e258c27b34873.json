We investigated whether Pneumocystis jirovecii DNA could also be detected in these cases by conducting retrospective screening of 324 consecutive NPAs from 324 adult patients (198 or 61% were immunocompromised) admitted with suspected pulmonary infections during the 2012 influenza epidemic season, using a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (PjqPCR), which targets the P. jirovecii mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA gene. These NPAs had already been tested for 22 respiratory pathogens (18 viruses and 4 bacteria), but we found that 16 NPAs (4.9%) were PjqPCR-positive, making P. jirovecii the fourth most prevalent of the 23 microorganisms in the screen. Eleven of the 16 PjqPCR-positive patients were immunocompromised, and five had underlying pulmonary conditions. Nine NPAs were also positive for another respiratory pathogen. Six had PjqPCR-positive induced sputa less than 3 days after the NPA procedure, and five were diagnosed with pneumocystis pneumonia (four with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders and one AIDS patient). In all six available pairs quantification of P. jirovecii DNA showed fewer copies in NPA than in induced sputum and three PjqPCR-negative NPAs corresponded to PjqPCR-positive bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, underscoring the fact that a negative PjqPCR screen does not exclude a diagnosis of pneumocystosis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a severe opportunistic infection caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii [1] , which occurs in immunocompromised patients, mainly those who are positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with low CD4 counts (<200 cells/mm 3 ) but also more and more frequently in patients that are immunocompromised due to other factors such as solid organ transplant recipients [2, 3] , patients with haematological malignancies or solid cancers [4, 5] , and those receiving immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune or inflammatory diseases [6] .

In our hospital P. jirovecii was the fourth most prevalent of the 23 respiratory pathogen assessed, with the influenza viruses (A, B, H1N1) the most prevalent (23%). Comparison with previous studies is difficult because patients were selected on the basis of BAL results [16] or focused on children [7, 17] . Testing based on DNA detection raises the issue of the meaning of a positive result and in the extent to which observed symptoms can be attributed to the relevant agent, particularly when several pathogens are detected simultaneously, as is typical in immunocompromised hosts [18, 22] . In our PjqPCR-positive samples, additional respiratory microorganisms were detected in 9/16 (56%) patients. Nevertheless, the 4.9% prevalence of P. jirovecii DNA in these samples cannot be interpreted as an incidental observation. Eleven of the 16 PjqPCR-positive belonged to a population at risk of PCP, such as patients with AIDS, haematological malignancies, solid tumors, renal transplantation, or receiving high-dose steroid therapy. Risk factors for colonization [23] , such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were also present ( Table 3) . Interpretation of the term colonization is disputable as these patients were symptomatic with febrile pneumonia. The retrospective design of our study precludes calculation of the sensitivity and specificity of NPA for detection of P. jirovecii DNA as patients did not undergo the same diagnostic work-up. In particular, there was no systematic analysis of sputum because the initial goal was detection of viruses but when a diagnostic workup was performed in six patients on the basis of clinical suspicion, five received a final diagnosis of PCP on the basis of microscopic observation of the fungus in IS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 419, "end": 423, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 447, "end": 450, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 451, "end": 454, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 733, "end": 737, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 738, "end": 741, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1213, "end": 1217, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1287, "end": 1295, "text": "Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "From a practical point of view three arguments can be made for adding P. jirovecii to the panel of microorganisms tested in cases of febrile pneumonia. First, as demonstrated here, NPA screening could be used to trigger further invasive investigation of patients at risk of PCP; alternatively clinical suspicion, radiological signs, and patient background might be considered sufficient basis for initiation of treatment with an anti-PCP drug. Second, a PjqPCRpositive NPA could be used to support anti-PCP drugs prophylaxis [24] , sometimes restrained due to the potential side effects of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Strict quantitative comparison is problematic given the heterogeneity of the volumes and the consistency of the clinical specimens; however, in all cases we observed fewer DNA copies in NPA samples than IS samples. A P. jirovecii-positive NPA may therefore correspond to a much higher fungal load in the alveoli and the thresholds applied in BAL and IS [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] should not be applied to NPAs. Of note, three patients with <1 P. jirovecii DNA copy/ml in NPA were diagnosed with PCP. Moreover, a NPA should contain a minimum number of human cells to avoid false negative results in virus [26, 27] and Aspergillus detection [28] ; we therefore cannot exclude the possibility that some NPAs were falsely negative for P. jirovecii or that the fungal load was considerably underestimated because of the poor quality of the NPA. Three PjqPCR-negative NPAs corresponded to PjqPCR-positive BAL fluids, indicating that a negative NPA cannot be used to exclude PCP.
