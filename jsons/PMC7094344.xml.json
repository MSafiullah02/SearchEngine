Originally discovered as a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-binding protein, DC-SIGN has been shown to bind carbohydrates on various pathogens, including Ebola, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, hepatitis C virus and cytomegalovirus.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 In the case of HIV-1 infection, DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR (together referred to as DC-SIGN/R) have been proposed to facilitate the viral infection of T-cells in trans through binding with HIV gp120.5, 12 However, recent evidence suggests that DC-SIGN/R function as antigen capturing receptors to facilitate the presentation of HIV-1 antigen by dendritic cells.13 DC-SIGN/R each consist of four domains: a cytoplasmic domain with a di-leucine motif for internalization, a single-spanning transmembrane region, a region with seven and one-half 23 amino acid residue repeats, and a carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD). DC-SIGNR is 77% identical with DC-SIGN in amino acid sequence, and differs mainly in tissue and cellular expression patterns although recent reports indicate that it may differ in binding and processing of pathogens.14, 15, 16\n",

This carbohydrate valency-dependent avidity effect was shown to be the result of DC-SIGN/R tetramerization through its repeat region.17, 21 To understand the nature of the receptor-carbohydrate interaction, we have determined the crystal structure of DC-SIGNR with a portion of the repeat domain. We propose a tetramer model for the intact extracellular receptor, and formulate a scheme to predict the potential ligands.",

At the C-terminus we observed additional density for amino acids 395\u2013398, including a disulfide bond between Cys395 and Cys265, which links both the N-and C-termini into close proximity (Figure 1). As a result, the ring of the N-terminal histidine residue (His267) stacks against the ring of the C-terminal Phe396. The helical repeat domain has been shown to be responsible for tetramerization of the receptor. Our DC-SIGNR R8 construct contains the last repeat that immediately precedes the CRD domain. This repeat region encompasses residues Gln249-Cys265. A portion of this repeat, Ala260-Cys265, is ordered in the structure and forms a short \u03b1-helix. Although the rest of the R8 repeat appears disordered in our crystal, presumably due to the proximity to the N terminus of the expressed recombinant R8 construct, the presence of a short helix is consistent with the secondary structure prediction that the repeat domain is mainly \u03b1-helical. The N-terminal CRD disulfide bond (Cys265-Cys395) and the helical repeat conformation was observed recently in the structure of DC-SIGNR R7 (CRD with its last two repeats).19, 22 The r.m.s deviation between the CRD domain of DC-SIGNR R8 and that of R7 is 0.76 \u00c5 for 129 C\u03b1 atoms. However, the hinge angle between the CRD and the repeat domain differs by about 40\u00b0 (100\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, respectively) between the two structures, indicating a domain flexibility between the CRD and the repeat domain of the receptor (Figure 1).",

The amino acid residues involved directly in coordinating the calcium ion are Glu359, Asn361, Glu366, and Asp378, and a water molecule (W19). With the exception of Asn377, which is rotated out of the calcium coordination, the ligand positions are well conserved between the R8 and CRD-only structures of DC-SIGNR (Figure 2\n(a) and Table 2\n). In contrast, no attributable electron density was found near the two auxiliary calcium ions (Ca1 and Ca3) binding site and the two residues coordinating the auxiliary calcium, Asn362 and Asn365, moved 4.0 \u00c5 and 1.9 \u00c5, respectively, compared to the CRD-only structure (1K9J). The movement of Asn362 and Asn365 effectively disrupts the coordination of Ca1 and Ca3, further evidence that both auxiliary calcium ions are absent from the DC-SIGNR R8 structure. Despite the presence of mannose in the crystallization buffer and the existence of additional electron density at the putative carbohydrate-binding site, attempts to fit mannose were not satisfactory, and instead, water molecules were built throughout the carbohydrate-binding site.",

In the presence of carbohydrate, the conformation of the primary carbohydrate-binding loop (residues 361\u2013366), the closed conformation, is defined by the coordinating hydrogen bonds between the side-chains of Asn361 and Ser363, and the bound N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc1) as well as between Asn362 and Asn365, and their bound Ca1 and Ca3. In the absence of carbohydrate, however, Ser363 moved 4.9 \u00c5 toward the solvent, resulting in a more open conformation for the primary carbohydrate-binding loop. In conjunction with this loop movement, Asn362 and Asn365 lost their coordination geometry for the auxiliary calcium sites. The ejection of the auxiliary Ca1 and Ca3, in turn, resulted in the displacement of another calcium coordination residue, Glu336 from the secondary calcium-binding loop, toward the solvent and thus adopting an open conformation for the loop (Table 2 and Figure 2). Interestingly, an arginine residue from a symmetry-related molecule, Arg397, is found near the putative Ca1 and Ca3 sites, forming a hydrogen bond with the secondary calcium-binding loop to neutralize, as a surrogate to the missing calcium ion, the partial negative charges of the region.",

Namely, they are glycan-induced calcium-binding sites. In the absence of the bound carbohydrate, both calcium coordination loops adopt an open, conformation ejecting the auxiliary calcium ions and become less ordered. The result suggests the function of these glycan-induced auxiliary calcium is to stabilize the conformation of the glycan-binding loops synergistically to the bound glycan rather than to pre-conform the glycan-binding loop.23, 24, 25\n",

Since identical trypsin digestion sites are found within each repeat region, a differential use of each potential trypsin site would suggest differential protection from the protease. The tight packing of the proposed model predicts a biased protease-sensitivity for the different repeats with the core tetramer packing repeats less accessible than the peripheral repeats, while the linear helical concatenation model predicts an equal protease-sensitivity for each repeat. The digestion with trypsin was carried out using a recombinant expressed and refolded full extracellular DC-SIGNR, termed DC-SIGNR R1, that has been characterized to be a tetramer.21 Digestion of DC-SIGNR R1 with trypsin resulted in four major fragments F1\u223c25 kDa, F2\u223c9 kDa 8, F3\u223c19 kDa, and F4\u223c7 kDa, with the F1 and F2 appearing before F3 and F4 in time-based digestions (Supplementary Data Figure 3). No other intermediate fragment could be identified. The amino-terminal sequencing revealed fragments F1 (residues 14\u2013237) and F2 (residues 238\u2013313) resulting from cleavages at trypsin sites between repeats R1 and R2 (site 1) and within the CRD (site 3). Fragments F3 (residues 14\u2013179) and F4 (residues 270\u2013313) appeared to be derived from F1 and F2 by further digesting at site 3 and 4, respectively (Figure 1). These results indicate that most of the tetramerization repeats (R2\u2013R8) remain resistant to digestion by trypsin, consistent with it being a compact tetramer unit rather than an elongated linear helical tetramer in which all repeats appear equally susceptible to protease. Digestion experiments with subtilisin are consistent with these results, indicating protease-sensitive sites being primarily between repeats R1 and R2, and after the helical repeat domain at the beginning of the CRD region.22\n",

Thus, much of the receptor-ligand binding affinity appears to be derived from an avidity effect of the DC-SIGN/R tetramer. The requirement of tetramer binding for ligand recognition would, in turn, impose limitations to its ligand selection. Namely, ligands carrying multiple glycosylations capable of engaging the multimeric DC-SIGN/R CRD simultaneously would be preferred by the receptor. The surface area encompassed by the tetrameric CRD in our current DC-SIGN/R model is approximately 6400 \u00c52, or 1600 \u00c52 per CRD molecule. This requires the potential ligands of DC-SIGN/R to possess a surface glycosylation level exceeding one glycan molecule per 1600 \u00c52 of its surface area. This enables us to formulate a potential ligand index i to evaluate potential ligands of DC-SIGN/R on the basis of their surface glycosylation density:(1)i=0.044SoN/M2/3=288N/M2/3where N is the number of predicted potential glycosylation sites and M is the molecular mass of the candidate protein. A potential DC-SIGN/R ligand would possess an index greater than 1.0 and proteins with the indices less than 1.0 are less likely to be ligands of the receptor.",

The functional receptors have been shown to be tetramers.17, 21 In addition, biochemical studies with repeat domain deletion mutants have shown that a minimum of three repeats are necessary to form tetramers, with additional repeats functioning to stabilize the tetramer.21 On the basis of the current crystal structures and available biophysical data, a tetramer for the entire extracellular DC-SIGNR receptor was constructed by homology modeling in which the repeat regions form helical bundles to bring together their CRDs in a 4-fold related symmetry. This helical bundle-mediated oligomerization resembles superficially the trimer of rat mannose-binding protein.20 While the receptor repeat domain is conserved in most species, a notable exception is that of Old World Rhesus monkey, whose DC-SIGNR gene (CD209L2) is missing all the repeats and DC-SIGN gene is missing the fourth repeat.27 CD209L2 is predicted to be a monomer and has been shown to be less efficient in binding to both ICAM-3 and HIV gp120. The fourth repeat in our model serves as a connecting helix between the two helical bundles. Deletion of this repeat would most likely shorten this connecting helix but may not affect the formation of the helical bundles (R6\u2013R8 and R1\u2013R3).

Nonetheless, the most obvious reasons to use the surface area of CRD instead of the distance are (1) to enable us to derive a prediction scheme based on surface glycan density of a potential ligand, and (2) to have the prediction less dependent on the precise conformation, thus, the degree of correctness, of the tetramer model.",

The high-affinity binding strategy employed by these receptors appears to be twofold. First, the structure of each individual CRD determines the preference of the receptor for particular carbohydrate structures. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the high-affinity interaction as well as ligand specificity rely on receptor oligomerization, which would increase the affinity of ligand binding and impose constraints on the density and distribution of carbohydrates found on target pathogens.",
