            "text": "The failed hospitality towards the aliens in the film is motivated in part by the citizens\u2019 relationships to national space. As argued in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-56726-6_2, biopolitics takes on a spatial dimension in its racist and speciesist forms as populations are managed in tightly patrolled areas to prevent things such as miscegenation or \u201ccontamination\u201d and other threats\u2014which stem from desire, materiality, and population\u2014to the ethnocentric state\u2019s aspirations of biological purity and its biopower. Agamben also identifies the concerns with space in biopolitical thought in his discussion of \u201cthe camp\u201d and the relationship between land, birth, and nationalism.4 Like the discomfort felt by characters in Disgrace when the presence of others reaches a threshold of \u201ctoo many,\u201d the citizens of Johannesburg are portrayed in Blomkamp\u2019s film as attempting to restore the homeliness of their city by removing the aliens. Violent riots and statements against the aliens\u2014the news headline reads: \u201cnon-humans violently evicted from townships\u201d\u2014confirm that these citizens occupy a privileged position in relation to the land as subjects of right. As \u201cmanagers of national space\u201d (Hage) they take it upon themselves and call on their government to remove these alien others from the city and from close proximity to it, viewing the aliens as objects to be managed without rights of their own. This failure in hospitality results in the government\u2019s hiring of Multi-National United (MNU) to fulfill its plan, headed by the film\u2019s white male protagonist,5 Wikus Van De Merwe, to relocate the aliens to District 10 much further away from the city. This scene demonstrates the arbitrary nature of the legal status of the aliens as the state grants or denies them rights as it sees fit or as it best benefits the state.",

            "text": "How does the space provided for the aliens by humanitarian aid organizations so quickly turn into a militarized camp? Agamben cites two examples as the possible first camps, and notably one of these is South African: \u201cHistorians debate whether the first camps to appear were the campos de concentraciones created by the Spanish in Cuba in 1896 to suppress the popular insurrection of the colony, or the \u2018concentration camps\u2019 into which the English herded the Boers toward the start of the century\u201d (Agamben 95). However, Achille Mbembe rightly argues that the colonies were the first states of exception in citing Arendt\u2019s observation of the treatment of \u201csavages\u201d as a precursor to that of Jews in the Second World War, and in remarking that \u201cin most instances, the selection of races, the prohibition of mixed marriages, forced sterilization, even the extermination of vanquished people are to find their first testing ground in the colonial world. Here we see the first syntheses between massacre and bureaucracy, that incarnation of Western rationality\u201d (22\u20133). Thus South Africa has a rather long history of the camp, and in District 9 Blomkamp suggests that this violent treatment in marking others as bare life will continue in the arrival of the aliens and their exclusion from the community. In his book about hospitality in J.M. Coetzee\u2019s fiction, Mike Marais says something similar when he argues of Disgrace that \u201c[w]hile apartheid may have ended, Coetzee\u2019s point seems to be, the history of the ostensibly new South African community still erects itself in the old manner: i.e. through a logic of collective discrimination which is, by definition, hostile to otherness, to singularity\u201d (224). The exclusions of the aliens from the \u201chuman\u201d community in District 9 then perpetuates a legacy that has its origins in colonialism, and, as I\u2019ll discuss later, in the traditional exclusion of animals from many human cultures.",

            "text": "Describing the space of the camp, David Farrier is right when, using terms from Deleuze and Guattari, he says that \u201cthe interstices available to and inhabited by the asylum seeker differ from that described by postcolonial studies as a \u2018 smooth space\u2019 of productivity and difference\u2014rather, it is a space of detention and exclusion through inclusion, striated by razor wire and legislated segregation\u201d (7). The aliens of District 9 have an \u201cimproper\u201d relation to the space where they come to dwell in Johannesburg as they don\u2019t fit the traditional state logic of being naturalized citizens in being born on the land. Wikus explains to the MNU agents that \u201cwe have to say this is our land, please will you go,\u201d demonstrating humans\u2019 rights over a space which aliens occupy without being subjects of rights. Agamben explains this assumption about the relationship between birth and sovereignty that underpins nationalism:If refugees \u2026 represent such a disquieting element in the order of the modern nation-state, this is above all because by breaking the continuity between man and citizen, nativity and nationality, they put the originary fiction of modern sovereignty in crisis. Bringing to light the difference between birth and nation, the refugee causes the secret presupposition of the political domain\u2014 bare life\u2014to appear for an instant within that domain. In this sense, the refugee is truly \u201cthe man of rights,\u201d as Arendt suggests, the first and only real appearance of rights outside the fiction of the citizen that always covers them over.

As Cary Wolfe puts it, \u201cto live under biopolitics is to live in a situation in which we are all always already (potential) \u2018animals\u2019 before the law\u201d (Before the Law 10). The state seeks to prevent all unauthorized or deterritorialized flows and occupations of space. As such, it includes the aliens in its territory only through excluding them from the realm of rights afforded its naturalized citizens. The laws of the state can only include aliens by outlawing them, making them illegal. The aliens of District 9 are included in this space of exclusion as they\u2014as an unexpected and unsanctioned flow\u2014are assimilated into the space of Johannesburg without being allowed in the realm of subjects of right and without being allowed to move beyond the strict confines of the camp (Fig. 6.1).\n",

Grey Bradnam, a correspondent in the film, comments in an interview that the 24-hour notice and protocol for eviction are a legal \u201cwhitewashing.\u201d Hired by the government, MNU operates with impunity as it manages the aliens\u2019 population and occupation of space in District 9. As the plan to evict the aliens is made public, the TV news reports that MNU should follow all UIO regulations, and human rights groups will be watching because they \u201csuspect abuses might occur.\u201d However, the temporary space of D9, which was an exception, has become normalized as \u201cthe camp\u201d and, as Agamben says of the camp, \u201cevery question concerning the legality or illegality of what happened there simply makes no sense\u201d (97). Occupying a status outside the realm of the subject of rights, the law and its protections do not apply to the space or people of the camp according to the state\u2019s logic of exclusionary inclusion. As \u201cbare life,\u201d the aliens are more vulnerable outside the protections of the state and therefore they occupy a space where it is acceptable to manage them as objects rather than subjects with rights, and even to kill them under the law in a \u201cnon-criminal putting to death.\u201d",

            "text": "Throughout the film, MNU workers, as hired security for the government, thwart the law to complete their eviction mission. The role of capital in this is notable as well since MNU receives payment from the government for executing the mass eviction and thus its actions are motivated by profit. The aliens become disposable then not only because of what Derrida and Wolfe might refer to as the \u201cautoimmune disorder\u201d (\u201cAfter Animality\u201d 184) of the South African community in refusing hospitality to foreigners but also because of MNU\u2019s financial interest in managing the alien population. The MNU\u2019s and the Nigerian gangsters\u2019 stockpiles of alien weaponry and testing on aliens further confirm the capitalist logic of surplus value extraction that adds to the disposability of the aliens. In essence, the government not only fails to extend hospitality to the aliens as they keep them separate from the rest of society in District 9 and approve their eviction to District 10 but also fails to ensure any other protections for the aliens, leaving it up to MNU, a corporation, to follow the law and to deal with the aliens unregulated. This situation recalls Pickover\u2019s discussion of South African industries that deal with animals, such as factory farming, which are responsible for following the laws written to protect animals or reduce animal suffering on their own with little or no government oversight (146\u20137). Already marked as bare life, the aliens become disposable not only to an ideal of a homely nation but also to the ambitions of a profit-seeking multinational corporation, which in capitalist fashion will sacrifice the safety and lives of others for a larger profit margin.",

For example, one alien hits the eviction papers clearly as a violent refusal when he is asked to sign them as a confirmation that they have been received. In response, Wikus says to another worker, and perhaps to the documentary camera, that the alien has made his mark in touching the paper and that it \u201ccounts as a scroll\u201d or signature. Importantly here, the role of the paper serves to administer the law to the aliens who, as stateless refugees, are paperless. The refusal to sign evokes Melville\u2019s \u201cBartleby the Scrivener,\u201d and that character\u2019s notorious refusals in the \u201cI would prefer not to,\u201d a text that David Farrier reads in Postcolonial Asylum. After noting Derrida\u2019s observation that paper determines legal subjectivity, Farrier argues that \u201cBartleby unsettles paper\u2019s legitimizing function\u201d (131) through the manner in which he performs his work as scrivener. More important than this literary intertextuality, however, the scene also evokes historical events in South Africa\u2014namely, the anti-apartheid activists\u2019 act of burning pass books to undermine the authority of the law\u2014the Pass Laws Act of the apartheid regime\u2014 a law developed to control and survey the movements of the African population. In District 9, however, Wikus distorts the alien\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the eviction paper into an acceptance of the authority of the law to advance MNU\u2019s population-management goals.",

As he removes what seems like a feeding tube from the egg, he jokes to another MNU worker that he can take the tube home as a souvenir of his first abortion. Wikus then calls for a \u201cpopulation control team,\u201d which sets fire to the shack with the \u201cprawn\u201d eggs, and they can be heard screaming as they burn. This scene of the sounds of non-human life coming from eggs recalls the discussion in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-56726-6_2 of Mr. Henry\u2019s attempted theft of an ostrich egg in The Devil\u2019s Chimney, where he cannot hear the noise emanating from the shell but the adult ostriches do, resulting in their protection of the egg and killing of Mr. Henry. In this scene, however, the eggs aren\u2019t saved as Wikus shows no signs of sympathy or concern for the aliens but is rather excited on his first day in this position of authority, performing for the camera and delighting in explaining that the sound of the alien eggs burning sounds like a popping, \u201clike a popcorn.\u201d Wikus and the other MNU workers function in this scene not unlike the doctors that Agamben mentions who took it upon themselves to decide life, something he notes as a power which used to be reserved for the sovereign:\n[B]iopolitics can turn into thanatopolitics, this line no longer appears today as a stable border dividing two clearly distinct zones. This line is now in motion and gradually moving into areas other than that of political life, areas in which the sovereign is entering into an ever more intimate symbiosis not only with the jurist but also with the doctor, the scientist, the expert, and the priest.

However, in this film, which focuses on the camp in its title, sexual desire across species is not explored as a positive force; rather, sexual desire gets reterritorialized as capitalist desire as the only instances of sex involve interspecies prostitution and MNU\u2019s false report about Wikus participating in sex acts with aliens as a means of making him killable. Discussing bestiality cases in colonial America, Colleen Glenney Boggs notes how, under the law, the act of bestiality can remove a subject of rights from that community, transporting that person into the state of exception. She explains how \u201cthe accused [of bestiality] was recognized as bios before the law, but his crime relegated him to the category of zo\u00eb in that he was stripped of his legal rights and put to death\u201d (34). In a scene which occurs after Wikus has begun to transform into an alien, this accidental and unwelcomed becoming-alien, when he has escaped from the MNU laboratory, he returns to a fast-food restaurant which he and other MNU workers dined at earlier in the film. While trying to keep a low profile by wrapping himself in a blanket, a news report comes on the TV reporting on his escape, which portrays him having sex with an alien, blurred, of course, for the purposes of decency, and he is immediately identified as the man on the news by the workers and patrons of the restaurant.",

As noted in the discussion of bestiality cases in South Africa in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-56726-6_2, this religious taboo against interspecies sex also has a long history in South Africa. In this sense, the TV report is constructed with the intent to position Wikus in a realm of \u201cnon-criminal putting to death.\u201d The MNU doubles up on this marking of Wikus as zoe, as more disposable and further away from bios, by appealing to the autoimmune anxieties of the security state through falsely reporting that Wikus is also highly contagious. Foucault explains this autoimmunitary logic in a discussion of racism and biopolitics:On the one hand, racism makes it possible to establish a relationship between my life and the death of the other that is not a military or warlike relationship of confrontation, but a biological-type relationship: \u201cThe more inferior species die out, the more abnormal individuals are eliminated, the fewer degenerates there will be in the species as a whole, and the more I\u2014as species rather than individual\u2014can live, the stronger I will be, the more vigorous I will be. I will be able to proliferate.\u201d The fact that the other dies does not mean simply that I live in the sense that his death guarantees my safety; the death of the other, the death of the bad race, of the inferior race (or the degenerate, or the abnormal) is something that will make life in general healthier: healthier and purer.\u201d (Society Must Be Defended 255)\n",

In this metamorphosis, this becoming-alien, Wikus loses his standing as a subject of rights, as described above, via MNU\u2019s media reports. While this becoming-alien or \u201cbecoming-minoritarian\u201d offers the potential for reorienting Wikus\u2019 sense of subjectivity and ethical attachments to others, specifically the aliens, he undermines the radical potentiality of this becoming as he seeks only to re-establish himself as a subject of rights in his privileged position.6 Deleuze and Guattari explain in A Thousand Plateaus that, \u201c[i]n a way, the subject in a becoming is always \u2018man,\u2019 but only when he enters a becoming-minoritarian that rends him from his major identity\u201d (291), and they describe how becoming \u201cconstitutes a zone of proximity and indiscernability, a no-man\u2019s-land\u201d (293).

Wikus replies: \u201cWe\u2019re not the fuckin\u2019 same.\u201d Indeed, most of his actions after his metamorphosis begins are geared toward \u201cfixing\u201d himself as he establishes an agreement with Christopher where he will help Christopher to steal the canister of liquid back from MNU if he agrees to return Wikus to his human state. However, the opportunity to reorient his sense of attachment away from a \u201chumans-only\u201d community continues beyond this selfish desire to return to a privileged position, even after the contract with Christopher is breached by being extended into the future.",

Earlier in the film, Wikus demonstrates this mastery in attempting to explain all the behavior of the aliens as if he had full knowledge of them, and, of course, he seems mistaken and wrong in most of his conjectures about alien culture. Where earlier Wikus engages with the aliens in brief and violent, largely one-way, conversations as a government-hired and therefore authoritative eviction notice deliverer, as a guest of Christopher, he engages with him for sustained periods of time with more even exchanges in communication. Extended periods of contact can enable transformations in the asymmetrical relations of the \u201ccontact zone,\u201d a term that Mary Louise Pratt developed to describe mostly colonial encounters in travel writing, and which Donna Haraway employs in her discussions of human\u2013animal relationships. She explains this transformative power via Vincaine Despret, a philosopher of science:Emphasizing that articulating bodies to each other is always a political question about collective lives, Despret studies those practices in which animals and people become available to each other, become attuned to each other, in such a way that both parties become more interesting to each other, more open to surprises, smarter, more \u201cpolite,\u201d more inventive. The kind of \u201cdomestication\u201d that Despret explores adds new identities; partners learn to be \u201caffected\u201d; they become \u201cavailable to events\u201d; they engage in a relationship that \u201cdiscloses perplexity.\u201d (Haraway 207)\n",

In response, this time Wikus turns round and protects Christopher, enabling his and his son\u2019s escape from the camp. What motivates this response? It is not his wanting to restore his dominant position or to secure his own safety. It is not out of a sense of upholding the law or a contract that has already been breached.

This self-centered reading is perhaps Michael Moses\u2019 assumption in his claim that \u201cthe most disturbing aspects of District 9 \u2026 [are] its thinly veiled portrait of post-apartheid South Africa as a political dystopia, and its persistent undercurrent of nostalgia for the old days of racial segregation\u201d (159). Moses continues this reading of Wikus as nostalgic for apartheid: \u201cThe ostensible white hero of the film does not want to join the aliens: indeed, his sole and abiding wish is to return to his comfortable home and his beautiful white wife, Tania\u201d (159). There are inconsistencies in such a reading, however, and I would submit that Wikus no longer has a \u201csole\u201d wish. Also, if we bracket, only momentarily, the important question of his returning to a dominant position in a society of such inequality, should we fault characters for wanting to live in comfortable homes with the people they love? This is, after all, what Christopher and his son and the other aliens of the camp seem to want as well. As Moses himself notes in the positive portrayals of Christopher and his son, and in the idea that \u201cthe degraded condition of the aliens might be interpreted from a liberal perspective as the result of their mistreatment and oppression by the South African authorities and MNU, rather than their inherent viciousness\u201d (159), the film certainly offers some positive representations of aliens and even the potential for a sustained positive reading of its portrayals of the othered aliens. While I\u2019ve argued in agreement with Moses that Wikus largely seeks to restore his dominant position throughout his opportunity for becoming-alien, this instance where he protects Christopher falls outside of a desire to return to a dominant self, as do a few other events, frustrating Moses\u2019 attempt to make Wikus into a totally selfish and dominant subject-seeking character.",

If anyone is a hero in the film, it is Christopher, a hero-to-come, who has worked for 20 years to collect liquid to power the ship in order to return to the home planet for help and, now that he is aware of it, to protect the aliens from being used in medical experiments. The film\u2019s choice of white protagonist who plays a role in protecting aliens runs the risk that several commercialized films do of perhaps implying racistly that the aliens need a white hero or savior figure. In this sense, this directorial decision recalls Laura Wright\u2019s critique of Dalton from The\nHeart of Redness, discussed in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-56726-6_5, for the way he has a solution but calculatingly withholds it until the last moment to position himself as a hero and rescuer of the community\u2014an action that Wright reads as continuing in a colonial logic that denies the autonomy and agency of indigenous people. Yet Wikus seems less calculating, and the film portrays his assistance to the aliens of District 9 as more unexpected and against his self-interest and egoism. Instead of being seen as a hero, Wikus might better be read as an allusion to Dirk Coetzee, a death squad leader for the apartheid regime who changed alliances by first confessing his murderous work in killing the ANC\u2019s political leaders of the anti-apartheid movement. He later worked for the ANC to help dismantle apartheid and prevent this while seeking its protections from the apartheid state. As leader of the eviction program in District 9, Wikus is certainly less knowledgeable of MNU\u2019s thanatopolitical practices and somewhat less violent than Coetzee; Wikus\u2019 switching of alliances is also not as clear or dramatic as Coetzee\u2019s because he only changes briefly right before the film\u2019s conclusion. However, Fundiswa Mhlanga, Wikus\u2019 assistant, perhaps completes this historical allusion as toward the end, the film shows that he is imprisoned for exposing to the public MNU\u2019s illegal genetic testing program on the aliens.",

His desire for his wife supersedes his capitalist desire to be a model employee and thereby to be a model state-hired eviction server and administrator of the state\u2019s biopower, suggesting that he has not been entirely colonized by capitalist definitions of desire. This excess desire, its possibility in what Foucault calls Homo economicus as a subject of interest that exceeds the subject of rights (The Birth of Biopolitics 275), is what biopower seeks to limit and capture in its mastery. In fact, desire threatens state and capitalist biopower more so than interest, as Deleuze and Guattari argue: \u201cAnd if we put forward desire as a revolutionary agency, it is because we believe that capitalist society can endure many manifestations of interest, but not one manifestation of desire, which would be enough to make its fundamental structures explode, even at the kindergarten level\u201d (Anti-Oedipus379). Even in this most ridgified subject, Wikus, its threat looms as a flow and power that might undo the dominant regime of biopower. The alien fluid which Wikus was exposed to and which now flows through his body (and which enabled Christopher\u2019s line of flight) dramatizes this effluvial character and potential of desire to overflow the bios-centered subject of rights. His father-in-law and director of MNU, Piet Smit, explains that Wikus\u2019 being married to his daughter did not factor into his calculation to appoint Wikus as head operative, seemingly to explain away any favoritism in the hire. Yet this explanation is more revealing in that biopower doesn\u2019t factor postcolonial desire\u2014Wikus\u2019 desire for his wife which exceeds his capitalist desires\u2014into its administration and calculations of managing life and death. His expressions of desire for his wife in this statement, and in creating the flower for her, frame the film in a way that demonstrates desire\u2019s ability to traverse species boundaries and transform ethical relationships and community boundaries drawn to mark off those who count and those who do not. The importance of this seemingly minor detail in Wikus\u2019 mentioning that his wedding is a more important day, if not already apparent, can be further highlighted through a comparison to a character discussed in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-56726-6_5.",

This postcolonial desire, seemingly absent from these characters\u2019 bios-centered subjectivities, presents the power for radical change even in its minuteness in occurring at the level of the individual, and has, as both texts bear out, significant revolutionary potential to change the state of affairs for those marked as \u201cdisposable\u201d in the workings of multinational corporations and the state.",

In helping Christopher, however, Wikus is no longer a dominant subject of rights who feels a lack of those rights; instead it is a transformed sense of self and a desire that positively flows from his belonging in an assemblage with Christopher and his son. In the closing scenes, Wikus, now fully alien, makes a metal flower on a garbage heap, which his wife later finds on her doorstep, hoping it\u2019s a gift from him. Moses reads this as confirmation that\nDistrict 9 stands as a troubling lament on behalf of South African whites for the world lost with the end of apartheid. Disturbingly, it literalizes the long-running nightmare of the white Afrikaner that the demise of apartheid spells the decline of the white ruling elite, who will be reduced to a condition identical to that of the continent\u2019s impoverished, exploited, and politically oppressed black masses.

            "text": "As I\u2019ve attempted to argue here, we should, instead, read this scene as an alien expressing desire for a human, or even without these categories of species, as an expression of desire between two bodies, two actants, in excess of and in resistance to the colonizing reterritorialization of capitalist desire. It is a desire which presents lines of flight away from the workings of biopower in the security state. The film\u2019s open ending, with the promise of an alien return, demonstrates the threat posed by zoe, by the non-human, and indeed by the desire which precedes thought as therefore the \u201cunthought at the heart of the thinking subject\u201d8 (Braidotti, Nomadic Subjects 112) given the way that this desire enabled Wikus\u2019 aid in Christopher\u2019s line of flight. This non-human desire flows through the posthuman subjects that we are becoming, a posthuman and postcolonial desire that overflows the highly ridgified category of the human and undoes it, thwarting its exclusionary violence. The promise of the untimely return of Christopher with more aliens to protect his people enabled by this zoe and assemblage is what bios-centered biopower hasn\u2019t thought of. In Nomadic Subjects, Braidotti explains how desire precedes thought after noting that Deleuze and Irigaray \u201cbank on the affective as a force capable of freeing us from hegemonic habits of thinking\u201d (40). She continues explaining that[a]ffectivity in this scheme stands for the preconscious and the prediscursive: desire is not only unconscious but remains nonthought at the very heart of our thought because it is what sustains the very activity of thinking. Our desires are that which evades us, in the very act of propelling us forth, leaving as the only indicator of who we are, the traces of where we have already been, that is to say, of what we have already ceased to be.

He is no longer colonized by dominant culture\u2019s obsession with the self and an oedipal definition of the self as a lacking subject. Capitalist and bios-centered dominant culture attempt to tame or master desire by defining and fixing it through representation as Freud\u2019s Oedipus does, assimilating it as a known entity into thought. Yet coming before thought, it retains its potential to resist this assimilation and operate otherwise, transforming dominant thought and dominant subjects. Braidotti also explains that desire comes from the materiality or corporeality of the body (Nomadic Subjects 112) in a way that points to both matter\u2019s resistance to physical mastery and desire\u2019s resistance to the mastery of thought. In its assumed totalitarian mastery, thanatopolitics cannot stop or prevent the threat of a revolutionary power of desire that has the potential to transform subjects and to deterritorialize the current state of affairs in order to protect the members of its assemblage from the non-criminal murderous operations of the biopolitical dispositif.",

            "text": "\nWhen learning about this film in Arizona in the US, students often point out its relevance to the situation of \u201cundocumented\u201d immigrants from Mexico and other parts of Latin America, whom the state includes only through exclusion in marking them as criminal, as \u201cillegal immigrants.\u201d Matthew Jones also points out that \u201cWhen van de Merwe warns one of the aliens not to go to District 10, the new camp built specifically for the visitors, the sense of urgency and horror in his voice leads one to imagine that inspiration for the solution to the alien problem might have been drawn from the Nazi\u2019s Final Solution or the Soviet Gulags\u201d (121).Animals are marked as even more disposable in this film as their bodies largely appear only as food. When his alien arm is tested by MNU for its capacity to operate alien weaponry, Wikus unsuccessfully attempts to refuse his being forced by electric prodding to shoot at the live alien target by explaining that he prefers to shoot the pig instead, which seems to possibly already be dead, having the effect of emphasizing the difference of lives and challenging biological continuism. What might be called animal aliens are also forced to fight each other to the death in the camp in a way that evokes the violence of cock and dog fighting. Lastly, in the scene where he protects Christopher\u2019s passage to the small aircraft, Wikus flings a pig (live or dead?) with incredible force to kill an MNU gunman. This is just the use of an animal as a mere blunt object as a weapon, and the film might have offered more creative ways of thinking about animal lives.I agree with Wolfe\u2019s position that you can\u2019t actually offer hospitality to everyone or everything in practice because, if you do, you can all but sentence the community to death. Unlike the trees that Qukezwa kills and the casino city which are banished from the village in The Heart of Redness because of the devastation they would visit on the community, the aliens in District 9 are not a colonizing threat to the community of Johannesburg; they are vulnerable and in need of help. Wolfe explains this problem of unconditional hospitality in practice by challenging the biological continuism of Esposito\u2019s affirmative biopolitics: \u201c[I]f we want to salvage the Deleuzean impulse of Esposito\u2019s conjugation of life and norm\u2014do we extend \u2018unconditional hospitality\u2019 to anthrax and ebola virus, to SARS?\u2014then we are necessarily driven back on a pragmatist rather than ontological reading of Deleuze\u201d (Before the Law 94). Further, it is in fact the autoimmune disorder of the state which creates the threats to its immunity as the violence against the aliens gives rise to potential revolutionary action against the human community in Christopher\u2019s promise of return. Roberto Esposito makes this point in Bios: Biopolitics and Philosophy: \u201c[A]s in all areas of contemporary social systems, neurotically haunted by a continuously growing need for security, this means that the risk from which the protection is meant to defend is actually created by the protection itself\u201d (qtd in Wolfe, Before the Law 49-50).See Bourke, \u201cBare Life\u2019s Bare Essentials.\u201d Bourke also highlights the film\u2019s engagement with Agamben\u2019s concepts of the camp, Homo sacer, and bare life.Lucy Valerie Graham notes this as a problem of the film as it becomes \u201cpart of a tradition of films that present, for Western viewers, the \u2018problem\u2019 or dilemma of the other, but do so through the lens of a white male focalizer who becomes a point of identification\u201d (162). To be sure, as a Hollywood blockbuster, the film is somewhat flawed in this regard and certainly in others, as I discuss below. The choice of white male protagonist does, however, have the benefit of pointing to the often elided violence upon which white privilege rests. Nonetheless, the film is still valuable for its commentary on the deployment of race and species discourse in biopower.Wikus\u2019 moving from a position as manager of those without rights to being without rights himself also alludes to the reversal for the protagonist, a colonial magistrate, of J.M. Coetzee\u2019s Waiting for the Barbarians when he loses his post for his engagements with \u201cthe barbarians\u201d and is imprisoned by Colonel Joll. Farrier reads this novel of Coetzee\u2019s for its representation of bare life; Coetzee\u2019s Life & Times of Michael K offers perhaps an even more overt engagement with \u201cthe camp,\u201d and Mike Marais discusses this in terms of hospitality in his book.In his review, Michael Valdez Moses notes this problem with the representation of Nigerians in District 9: \u201cObesandjo and his gang members are a distillation of some of the most negative contemporary South African stereotypes of Nigerian immigrants, tens of thousands of whom have entered the country illegally since the 1980s, and some of whom are part of a nationwide (indeed international) crime syndicate trafficking in drugs and engaging in other illegal activities that got its start in Johannesburg in the late 1980 s\u201d (158). Similarly, in her review entitled \u201cAmakwerekwere and Other Aliens: District 9 and Hospitality,\u201d Lucy Valerie Graham discusses the problems with the representations of the Nigerians when she \u201cacknowledge[s] the rather obvious point that although the film critiques xenophobia, it ultimately perpetuates it\u201d (162).Ron Broglio makes a similar point in reporting from the field of the animal revolution, a point informed by Erica Fudge\u2019s \u201cA Left-Handed Blow\u201d: \u201cAs the [human] hand which is thought covers the paw, claw, hand of the animal, out of nowhere comes the other hand, the paw or claw or jaw of a left-handed blow. Reason never counted on being outwitted by that which it rejects outright\u2014idiocy, dullness, the body, and the animal\u201d (28).Agamben explains the need to stop this anthropological machine in The Open: Man and Animal:\u201cLike every space of exception, this zone is, in truth, perfectly empty, and the truly human being who should occur there is only the place of a ceaselessly updated decision in which the caesurae and their rearticulation are always dislocated and displaced anew \u2026 . And faced with this extreme figure of the human and the inhuman, it is not so much a matter of asking which of the two machines (or of the two variants of the same machine) is better or more effective\u2014or, rather, less lethal and bloody\u2014as it is of understanding how they work so that we might, eventually, be able to stop them\u201d (37). Cary Wolfe also explains this space left open by the sacrifice of animals: \u201c[A]s long as the automatic exclusion of animals from standing remains intact simply because of their species, such a dehumanization by means of the discursive mechanism of \u2018animalization\u2019 will be readily available for deployment against whatever body happens to fall outside the ethnocentric \u2018we\u2019\u201d (Before the Law 21).\n",
