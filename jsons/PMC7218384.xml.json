The total number of global deaths on the date of submitting this paper (24 April 2020) has risen to 191.263, with 2.717.004 infected (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020c). The economic impact will be undoubtedly colossal and we are still unaware of the real consequences this will have on each country's economy and on the labor market. It is not the first pandemic that we have suffered, but the dimensions of this one are especially shocking and only comparable to the flu pandemic of 1918, a little over a century ago. It is certainly a public health threat that goes beyond occupational health and safety, and it transgresses the borders of business organizations, being of primary concern to virologists and epidemiologists, but also to technicians, specialists and academics in the field of safety who can make a significant contribution to its prevention. In addition to the past and present research carried out to create detection tests, vaccines, antivirals and other treatments, the main measures used in the health, work and domestic spheres have focused on social distancing and lockdown, as well as on the monitoring of safety protocols, the adoption of hygiene measures, and the use of personal protection equipment such as masks, gloves, etc. This has meant that terms that were previously used by occupational health and safety professionals alone, such as FFP2, FFP3, N95, KN95, etc., have become part of the common language and have had a positive effect in the field of health and safety by popularizing and increasing the culture of prevention of society as a whole.",

            "text": "However, we cannot forget the importance that the World Health Organization (WHO) has played in this context. It initially made different recommendations for the groups including healthcare personnel, people in direct contact with the infected and people with symptoms (Holland et al., 2020, Jansson et al., 2020) on the one hand, and for the rest of the people on the other. While recommending the use of masks for the first three groups of people, it did not do the same for individuals, where it focused on measures of social distancing, minimum interpersonal distance, and personal hygiene, more specifically the adequate washing of hands, since airborne propagation was ruled out under normal conditions (WHO, 2020a). To date, although the WHO acknowledges that \u201cwearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including COVID-19\u201d (WHO, 2020c) it also says that \u201chowever, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted\u201d. Therefore, on 20 April 2020, it still recommends that \u201cIf you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with COVID-19\u201d (WHO, 2020b). Nevertheles, it advises that each country apply a risk-based approach, that is, considering the benefits (possibility of reducing the potential risk of exposure during the presymptomatic period) as well as the potential risks (self-contamination, false sense of security, impact on mask shortages), when deciding whether to recommend the use of masks by the general population (WHO, 2020c).",

Likewise, other types of masks have been included in the classification in order to obtain a complete overview of those that are currently being used due to the situation caused by COVID-19 such as cloth, hygienic, homemade or non-medical masks. This classification has been developed based on the definitions proposed by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020a), although it has been adapted to include new types of masks such as hygienic masks according to Specification UNE 0064:2020 and UNE 0065:2020 recently developed by the Spanish Association for Standardization (UNE, 2020a, UNE, 2020b, UNE, 2020, 2020d). These masks are intended for people or children without symptoms who are not susceptible to using surgical, medical or PPE/filter masks to protect them against particles, in accordance with the restrictions established by the Government of Spain, which currently recommends these latest types of masks for healthcare workers and people infected or with symptoms of COVID-19. Therefore, table 1 focus on disposable mask such as PPE, medical mask and others that can be single use (non-reusable hygienic mask) or some uses (barrier mask, reusable hygienic mask, cloth mask\u2026). Reusable face mask respirators, such as reusable half mask or full face mask, that allow long-term use by changing their filters are not included in this classification (see Figure 3).",

For this purpose, the manufacturer will have a set of standards, the main one being EN 149:2001 +A1:2009, entitled \u201cRespiratory Protective Devices. Filtering half mask to protect against particles. Requirements, testing, marking\u201d (AENOR, 2010). Additionally, the manufacturer should abide by a series of standards, among which the following should be highlighted: EN 132: 1999. \u201cRespiratory protective devices - Definitions of terms and pictograms\u201d (AENOR, 1999); EN 134: 1998. \u201cRespiratory protective devices - Nomenclature of components\u201d (AENOR, 1998), EN143:2001. \u201cRespiratory protective devices.

This summary of standards will facilitate the presumed compliance of the manufacturer, and will usually lead to the certification of the mask according to the standard. There are also other countries outside Europe with their own similar certification or homologation systems, such as the United States (42 CFR 84), China (GB2626-2006), South Korea (KMOEL-2017-64), Australia/New Zealand (AS/NZA 1716:2012), Japan (JMHLW-2000), etc. (see table 3).

However, this document contains recommendations for design and use but does not allow conformity assessment by notified bodies or laboratories. On the other hand, the Spanish Association for Standardization (UNE) published some key specifications to facilitate the manufacture of hygienic masks that, if made under this specification, would offer people protection against the COVID-19 pandemic (UNE, 2020c, 2020e). In that way, on April, 2020, the Specification UNE 0064 for non-reusable hygienic masks and the Specification UNE 0065 for reusable hygienic masks were published. The first is made up of two parts: Specification UNE 0064-1. Non-reusable hygienic masks. Materials, design, manufacturing, marking and usage requirements. Part 1: For adult use and Specification UNE 0064-2. Non-reusable hygienic masks. Materials, design, manufacturing, marking and usage requirements. Part 2: For children use and establishes specifications for manufacture and use. The second is made up of a single part: Specification UNE 0065. Reusable hygienic masks for adults and children. Materials, design, manufacturing, marking and use requirements (UNE, 2020d).

(2008) compared in a laboratory the protection for airborne particles of surgical masks against FFP respirators and found the lowest level of respiratory protection in surgical masks against FFP respirators. Specifically, they calculated a reduction factor for exposure to live aerosolized influenza virus as the ratio of the particle concentration inside and outside for each mask. Their results indicated that a properly adjusted FFP respirator can provide a mean reduction factor in exposure of 100 while a surgical mask would provide a mean reduction factor of 6. On the other hand, Lee et al (2008) have undertaken the task of comparing the N95 respirators and surgical masks against particles representing bacterial and viral size ranges. As a result, their study found that around 29% of N95 respirators and 100% of surgical masks had a protection factor <10 (protection factor set by OSHA for that type of mask). So, they concluded that the N95s may not offer the expected protection level against bacteria and viruses. However, in 2016 we found the work of Smith et al. (2016) in which they compared the effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks in protecting healthcare workers from acute respiratory infection. Their study did not find sufficient evidence to uniquely determine that N95 respirators are superior to surgical masks as protection for healthcare workers against acute respiratory infections in clinical settings. However, they pointed out that in the laboratory setting, the N95 respirators seemed to offer greater protection than the surgical masks. A similar study was carried out by Radonovich et al (2019) to compare the effect of N95 respirators vs. surgical masks to protect healthcare workers against influenza and other viral respiratory infections. They found no significant difference between the two masks in the incidence of influenza in the laboratory setting.",

To do this, they tested these masks for 20\u20131000 nm size particles, specifically, polydisperse and monodisperse aerosols, at two speeds. Since there are a wide variety of homemade masks with various characteristics, they used the five main types made of sweatshirts, T-shirts, towels, scarves, and cloth in the test. Furthermore, they compared the results with the penetration levels presented by N95 respirators. Their results indicated that these masks had 40\u201390% instantaneous penetration levels at a low speed and between 9-98% at a higher speed. Subsequently, MacIntyre et al. (2015) compared the effectiveness of cloth mask vs. medical mask in a hospital. In this study, 1607 healthcare workers participated, who wore the masks for 4 weeks during their shifts in the hospital and performed procedures where aerosols are usually generated, such as suctioning of airways, sputum induction, endotracheal intubation and bronchoscopy. Their results indicate that the penetration of the medical mask by the particles was 44% while the penetration for the cloth mask was almost 97%.",

In another recent study, tests were conducted with the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 in aerosols and on various surfaces.

If the worker stores and uses their FFP respirators in order each day, a minimum of five days between the use of each FFP respirator elapses (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a). However, these recommendations should be treated with caution, since FFP respirators are designed for single-use and could be damaged, lose some of their properties and become ineffective as a barrier against contagion. Furthermore, due to the aforementioned shortage, five FFP respirators may not be available per healthcare worker. Therefore, it is necessary to study disinfection or sterilization methods.",

It therefore appears that this method is of singular importance. Therefore, Song et al. (2020) carried out a study on FFP respirators, but with the flu virus, and used an oven for 30 minutes at 56\u00b0C as well as hot air from a hair dryer for 30 minutes. These researchers obtained total inactivation in the case of the dryer and partial inactivation of the virus in the case of the oven, without affecting filtering capacity. Based on this, both the Spanish Ministry of Labor and Social Economy (2020) and the International Medical Center of Beijing (2020) indicate that FFP respirators maintain their filtration efficiency after being disinfected at 70\u00b0C for 30 minutes, although no effects on the fit or deformation are mentioned. According to N95DECON (2020d), it could be pointed out as an advantage that under these conditions, heat inactivates related coronavirus, although the disadvantage is that there are no data confirming that SARS-COV-2 is inactivated with dry heat and several decontamination cycles could lead to the degradation of the effectiveness of the filtration or the fit. In this way, Spanish Society of Preventive Medicine, Public Health and Hygiene (2020) recommends, as a method of decontamination for FFP respirators, dry heat <70\u00b0C for 30 minutes in a convection oven to guarantee constant and uniform temperature maintenance. Likewise, Price and Chu (2020) recommend disinfection under those same conditions and they add that it could be done for 20 cycles.",

(2020) conducted another study where they analyzed the scientific literature available in this regard and concluded that the existing findings in other studies seem to support that ozone inactivates viruses by attacking capsid proteins. They proposed a decontamination method using ozone to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Thus, they performed different experiments in two ozone decontamination boxes. Based on this, they proposed practical recommendations to implement a simple disinfection box system using inexpensive and readily available components that could be used for FFP respirators. The ozone concentrations required are 10 to 20 ppm with an exposure for at least 10 minutes. They noted that it is an improvised solution for situations of need such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but not an optimal long-term solution. Among the advantages of ozone gas, they indicated that its virucidal action is faster than the degradation effect of the FFP respirator, which is effective for disinfecting fibrous materials, as it is a dry virucidal, and that it reaches shadows and crevices in the process disinfection, unlike ultraviolet radiation as will be seen later.",

As a result, the viral load on both glass carriers and PPE materials decreased after exposure to PX-UV. Numerous studies are therefore currently being carried out to determine its effectiveness for decontamination against the coronavirus. O'Hearn et al. (2020), have developed a systematic review on the efficacy and safety of FFP respirators(N95) after decontamination with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). They have analyzed 13 papers and have concluded that the filtering effectiveness of FFP respirator is maintained after a UVGI cycle and they propose the use of a cumulative UV-C dose of 40,000 J/m2 in future research to validate this promising method. Likewise, they have indicated that it will be necessary to carry out fit tests. Moreover, Card et al (2020) analyzed the possibility of using biosafety cabinets for the decontamination of FFP respirators (N95) by ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). For this purpose, they tested the UV-C radiation in two randomly chosen idle biosafety cabinets in which they measured the minimum intensity and obtained a factor of 1:71 and 1:98 less than the maximums of each biosafety cabinet, respectively. Based on the maximum observed ratio (1:98), they estimated the sterilization time for FFP respirators (N95) in a biosafety cabinet. Finally, they developed a protocol to disinfect an FFP respirator after irradiating it for 15-20 minutes per side with a fluence of 100 \u00b5Wcm-2 (per manufacturer\u2019s records).",

Likewise, the necessary levels of UVGI do not affect the fit and filtering effectiveness of the FFP respirators and can be safely administered after providing adequate safeguards. According to them, Hamzavi et al. (2020) recommend its use for the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 due to the shortage of FFP respirators, highlighting that UVGI does not degrade the polymers. Thus, there are already other organizations that recommend this protocol proposed by Nebrasca Medicine as a decontamination method (N95DECON, 2020e). Similarly, Spanish Society of Preventive Medicine, Public Health and Hygiene (2020) includes among the recommended decontamination methods for FFP respirators the UVGI with double lamp (up and down) 36W and exposure time of 148 seconds.

Therefore, it would be necessary to develop methods or procedures that can eliminate this uncertainty. In this regard, Fisher and Shaffer (2011) established a method to evaluate decontamination of inner layers of FFP respirators (N95) using ultraviolet-C. Therefore, based on this study, a standard procedure could be established to evaluate the effectiveness of UVGI in the inner layers and confirm or rule out its possible use for the inactivation of the coronavirus in FFP respirators.",

In this study, only the efficacy of disinfection for the inactivation of G. stearothermophilus spores was verified. They specifically demonstrated that they had achieved a 6-log reduction in organism and that inactivation continued to occur in up to 50 decontamination cycles. Regarding mechanical integrity and performance in up to 50 cycles, the filtration capacity was maintained, but the adjustability was affected because the strap became degraded after 10 to 20 cycles and broke after 30 cycles. The recommended wash cycle was 480 minutes. In this way, they demonstrated that this process was feasible to decontaminate large amounts of FFP respirators simultaneously (up to 50 cycles) with Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor, since the filtration requirements of FFP respirators were maintained, although they recommended studying alternative materials for the straps or studying other models of FFP respirators (Battelle, 2016).",

This study has confirmed that hydrogen peroxide sterilization is a valid reprocessing method for FFP respirators (FFP2) in order to inactive coronavirus. To reach this conclusion, unused FFP respirators were reprocessed by applying different types of processes such as cleaning and drying with and without detergent or chemical disinfection, vaporized hydrogen peroxide low pressure gas sterilization applied at different times and steam sterilization. Subsequently, FFP respirators were subjected to a fit test to verify that they fit properly and that the filter material continued to be a good barrier against particles. The fit test results for an untreated FFP respirator showed an average value of 162. Therefore, a reprocessed FFP respirator must have a minimum average value of 100 to pass the fit test. The results are presented in Table 5\n. Based on these, it was preliminarily concluded that \u201cdouble sterilization using a short process with hydrogen peroxide gives an acceptable result\u201d (Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, 2020).",

The washing cycle must be equal to or longer than 30 minutes at 60\u00b0C. The use of regular detergents is recommended.

Among the different methods, the available literature seems to point out that the most promising methods are those that use hydrogen peroxide vapor, ultraviolet radiation, moist heat, dry heat and ozone gas. Within them, hydrogen peroxide vapor treatment appears to be the best system and is being widely recommended. Although ultraviolet reduction has also been recommended in some countries, there are those who point to doubts about its effectiveness in the inner layers due to shadows. Dry heat also appears to be effective although it has not been widely recommended. There is even a study that points out the effectiveness of dry heat using a hair dryer for disinfection. The moist heat is currently being evaluated to verify that it does not degrade the fit or the filtration capacity. Ozone gas appears to be effective in decontaminating FFP respirators without damaging them, although it presents risks for the safety and health of workers who carry out the process if it is not handled properly",
