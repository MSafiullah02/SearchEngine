The pathogens traditionally associated with CIRD include canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV)(Appel and Percy, 1970), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2)(Ditchfield et al., 1962), and Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb) (Bemis, 1992), which act sequentially or synergistically to cause disease. Several multivalent vaccines targeting these agents are available for routine vaccination (Day et al., 2016). However outbreaks of respiratory disease continue despite their use, resulting in expensive treatment costs and delays in rehoming or training (Erles et al., 2004).",

Briefly the clinical scores described previously (Erles et al., 2003) were defined as: 1) no respiratory signs, 2) mild cough, 3) cough and nasal discharge, 4) cough and nasal discharge with depression and/or inappetence, 5) cough and nasal discharge with depression and/or inappetence and clinical signs of lower respiratory tract disease.",

Whilst CIRD is generally regarded as a disease of kennelled dogs as shown here, we have also provided substantial evidence of CIRD in pet (client-owned) dogs, many of which had moderate to severe signs of disease, highlighting the need for further consideration of pet dogs in the occurrence and spread of CIRD, and the potential risk factors associated with this group (e.g. multi-dog households, attendance at dog training, doggy day care, recent boarding or kennelling). However, the high rate of CIRD observed in client-owned dogs, compared to kennelled dogs, is most likely explained by an inherent sampling bias. Healthy client-owned dogs are unlikely to have been presented or sampled as part of a normal veterinary investigation, except in some cases of multi-dog households, doggy day care etc. where CIRD has been problematic. In contrast, sampling of apparently healthy dogs in kennelled environments often forms part of a standard outbreak investigation.",

Within the EU it is recommended that dogs are routinely vaccinated against CAV-2 and CDV as part of the core vaccinations they receive from puppyhood. The modified-live virus vaccines are administered parenterally, and are highly efficacious (Day et al., 2016). Some core vaccine formulations include CPIV but not Bb, and whilst separate modified-live intranasal vaccines for Bb and CPIV are availaible they tend to be administered only to high risk dogs (i.e. during periods of kennelling). Studies of CPIV and Bb vaccine efficacy are regulated by European monographs, requiring specific efficacy and safety requirmemnts including the onset and duration of immunity. However, published studies are limited and there is debate on the differing efficacies demonstrated (Day et al., 2016, Ellis, 2015, Ellis and Krakowka, 2012, Mitchell and Brownlie, 2015).",

Younger dogs (less likely to have antibodies to CRCoV) were more likely to be infected with CRCoV, and had a greater rate of occurrence of CIRD, and developed more severe clinical signs. These findings are consistent with previously published data (Erles et al., 2004, Erles et al., 2003, Mitchell et al., 2013a), and strengthen the evidence for a causal relationship between CRCoV infection and CIRD, as well as for the protective effect of CRCoV antibodies against both CRCoV infection and clinical signs of CIRD in general.

Although shelter dogs and dogs from \u2018other sources\u2019 had significantly increased odds of being positive compared to pet dogs, the higher seroprevelce observed in dogs from \u2018other sources\u2019 is most likely due to the samples being derived predominantly from an outbreak of CIRD in a single veterinary hospital, where, 96% of dogs were seropositive and 33% were positive for the virus.",

In further support of this, dogs were significantly more likely to be positive for CnPnV (by PCR) if they were also positive for CRCoV (by PCR). Although only 17 such cases were observed in this study, precluding further analysis, CIRD is increasingly being considered as a complex infection where multiple agents act sequentially or synergistically to cause disease, and similar disease complexes in humans are the subject of several reviews Eg: (Bosch et al., 2013). It is likely therefore that co-infections with both the classic and novel agents of CIRD will contribute the increased likelihood of disease onset, severity and duration of CIRD.

This relationship was however significant at the univariable level consistant with other published data (Mitchell et al., 2013b), suggesting that whilst CnPnV specific antibodies may confer some degree of protection, this was confounded in this instance by the effects of other factors. That said, it is well documented that antibody mediated immunity for related human and bovine respiratory syncytial viruses is poor, and individuals may be repeatedly re-infected throughout their lifetime with clinical signs of respiratory disease (Falsey, 2007, Hall et al., 1976, Van der Poel et al., 1993). A number of key pneumovirus features enable them to evade and modify host immune responses as reviwed by (Collins and Melero, 2011), and as such it would be vital to assess the genetic and antigenic diversity of circulating CnPnV strains to better understand CnPnV ecology and inform vaccine design and development.",

Given the limited number of positive cases in this study it is not possible to comment on the prevalence of M. cynos or its relationship with clinical disease. However it is worth considering the limitations of the study which may have influenced this finding. Firstly, several mycoplasma species are carried by dogs, often as part of their normal respiratory flora (Chalker, 2005), however very limited data is available regarding their serological cross-reactivity (Rosendal, 1975). The possibility exists therefore that the use of whole cell ELISA antigen in this study may have resulted in an overestimate in M. cynos seropositivity. Secondly, oropharyngeal swabs collected as part of a standard veterinary investigation of CIRD were analysed. Previously respiratory tissues were shown to yield a much higher recovery rate of M. cynos (99.7\u201323.9%) compared to oropharyngeal swabs (0\u20130.9%) (Chalker et al., 2004), and indeed studies that have implicated M. cynos in CIRD were based on tissue sampling, particularly of the lower respiratory tract (Hong and Kim, 2012, Zeugswetter et al., 2007), the level of M. cynos detected in this study may therefore have been vastly underestimated and highlights an important consideration for the study of M. cynos in living dogs.",

            "text": "Influenza A (H3N8) caused significant respiratory disease in dogs in north America (Anderson et al., 2013, Crawford et al., 2005) with an estimated seroprevalence of 49% in high risk populations (Anderson et al., 2013). Subsequent studies from North and Central America and Asia have also identified a number of other influenza A subtypes which infect and cause disease in dogs, some of which have undergone cross-species transmission, including possible transmission between dogs and humans (Lin et al., 2012, Song et al., 2008, Song et al., 2012, Songserm et al., 2006). Assays were therefore selected on the basis that they would allow for the broad detection of Influenza A rather than specific subtypes (Damiani et al., 2012, Ellis and Zambon, 2001).In agreement with other recently published European studies (Damiani et al., 2012, Dundon et al., 2010) however very little evidence of influenza A was found in this study. All of the dogs were negative for Influenza A by PCR, and only 2.7% had evidence of exposure via antibody detection. Whilst influenza A appears relatively insignificant in the European dog population at present, given its rapid spread across north America and Asia, the increasing number of influenza A subtypes detected in dogs, and the increased movement of dogs into and across Europe, it may be only be a matter of time before it makes its appearance. Moreover, the co-existence of multiple types of influenza in dogs, with the potential to cross-species, should underline the importance of continued vigilance by both the veterinary and medical communities.",

This study, which has begun to unpick some of these key areas, is one of the largest studies undertaken in the field to date. Findings highlight the need for a far greater consideration of pet dogs and other dog populations, the role of current vaccine formulations and strategies in preventing and managing disease outbreaks, and the impact of classic and newly identified pathogens on disease onset, development and persistence. For pathogens such as CRCoV and CnPnV, the emerging data provide a clearly identifiable link with CIRD. However continued effort is required to characterise the epidemiology and pathogenesis of more elusive pathogens such as M. cynos, to ensure that they are not underestimated or overlooked.",
