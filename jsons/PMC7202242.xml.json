Infectious diseases can also cause significant population declines in wildlife, as illustrated by canine distemper virus in Serengeti lions (Roelke\u2010Parker et al. 1996), Ebola outbreaks in African apes (Leroy et al. 2004), and multiple pathogens that affect amphibian populations (Daszak et al. 1999; Pounds et al. 2006). Despite evidence that parasites can increase extinction risk in wild animals (Woodroffe 1999; Daszak et al. 1999), few researchers have investigated the factors associated with parasite\u2010mediated declines or extinctions (but see Lafferty & Gerber 2002; de Castro & Bolker 2005; Smith et al. 2006). Even less is known about the phylogenetic distribution of infectious disease risks among wild host species and the ecological factors that drive these patterns.",

            "text": "Threatened host populations are predicted to harbor relatively few parasite species as a consequence of limited geographic ranges and small, isolated populations (Lyles & Dobson 1993; Lafferty & Gerber 2002). Mathematical models of single\u2010host, single\u2010parasite systems suggest that horizontally transmitted parasites will be lost if host populations decline below a critical threshold density (Anderson & May 1992). For several reasons, however, parasite\u2010induced extinction are more probable in situations involving multihost parasites and frequency\u2010dependent transmission and when in concert with other drivers of extinction (de Castro & Bolker 2005). First, many parasites can infect multiple species, and high prevalence in alternative hosts coupled with cross\u2010species transmission can lead to parasite\u2010induced declines in species that would normally be unable to maintain the parasite (Gog et al. 2002; Fenton & Pedersen 2005). In carnivores, for example, several near extinctions have been caused by generalist parasites transmitted to populations of threatened species (Woodroffe 1999; Lafferty & Gerber 2002). Second, the transmission of some parasites, such as sexually transmitted and vector\u2010borne diseases, may be decoupled from host population density (Getz & Pickering 1983); these parasites can therefore continue to spread even as host populations decline (Boots & Sasaki 2003). Finally, many threatened mammals are predisposed to extinction risk because their populations are fragmented and small and they have low genetic variability (Woodroffe 1999; Altizer et al. 2003). These factors can increase host susceptibility and exposure to infectious diseases (Lyles & Dobson 1993), or infectious diseases might represent an additional factor that increases stochastic extinction risk (McCallum & Dobson 1995).",

Parasites rarely have been implicated as a direct cause of host extinction risk relative to other factors such as habitat loss, hunting, and invasive species (Wilcove et al. 1998; Purvis et al. 2000). Indeed, Smith et al. (2006) found infectious disease to be an uncommon cause of extinction and critical endangerment for most plants and animals. Only 3.7% of 833 known species extinctions have been attributed in part or directly to infectious disease. Because of uncertainty in threat assessments and a strong temporal bias in reporting infectious disease as a threatening process, however, such low estimates probably represent only a subset of the species at risk of disease\u2010mediated extinction (Smith et al. 2006).",

To identify factors associated with disease\u2010mediated threats, we independently assessed the parasites reported to cause declines in threatened mammals. We define parasites broadly to include macroparasites (i.e., helminths, arthropods, protozoa) and microbial pathogens (i.e., viruses and bacteria). We focused on hosts for which parasites have been cited previously as a major cause of threat according to the IUCN Red List, independently assessed the parasites reported to cause population declines in these mammals, and developed a comprehensive data set on host and parasite characteristics.",

We therefore expected that mammals from clades that contain domesticated animals would be more likely to be threatened by parasites shared with domesticated species. We further predicted that parasites reported to cause population declines in threatened mammals would have broad host ranges and be transmitted via biting arthropods, contaminated food or water, or other indirect routes that are decoupled from direct host contact. Finally, we investigated sampling gaps and potential biases in the degree to which parasites have been identified as risk factors for threatened mammals. Relative to other threatened hosts, we tested whether mammal species identified as threatened by parasites were better studied in terms of infectious diseases, had higher levels of parasitism overall, or possessed host traits that might facilitate parasite establishment, including higher population density, greater body mass, or larger geographic ranges.",

For each mammal species for which data were available (n= 4864), we recorded threat status as nonthreatened (least concern), near threatened, and threatened (conservation\u2010dependent, vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered, and extinct in the wild). Independent of host threat status, we also recorded mammal species or subspecies for which parasites have been identified as a major cause of threat based on summary documentation in the IUCN Red List for \u201cmajor threats.\u201d Identification of a major threat is based on two classifications: \u201cinvasive alien species \u2013 pathogens/parasites\u201d (threat 2.4), and \u201cchanges in native species dynamics \u2013 pathogens/parasites\u201d (threat 8.5). For many species, key information regarding the causes of endangerment is available only in detailed reports that are not accessible via on\u2010line searches of the IUCN Red List (Clavero & Garcia\u2010Berthou 2005). This can lead to missing records and potential systematic biases if, for example, some types of species have summary documentation available, whereas others do not. This is unlikely to be a problem in our data set, however, because summary documentation on cause of threat was specified for 73% of threatened species and included species from each of the major mammal clades.",

Only a few species were identified in this third group; as discussed later, they may represent errors in the IUCN summary documentation or species that are not currently threatened by parasites but that have a predicted future risk from infectious diseases.",

These categories are not mutually exclusive, and approximately 48% of parasites were transmitted by multiple routes.

For this we used an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test cause of threat (parasites vs. other factors) against host citation counts and biological traits (model: dependent variable = host order + threat + host order \u00d7 threat). Finally, we used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to compare parasite species richness (PSR) between host species threatened by parasites relative to other threatened hosts (model: PSR = host order + threat + citations counts + host order \u00d7 threat + threat \u00d7 citation counts).

            "text": "Wild mammals are a well\u2010studied taxonomic group that is currently experiencing a wave of extinctions (Purvis et al. 2000; Cardillo et al. 2005). It has become increasingly clear that infectious diseases represent an emerging cause of population declines and extinctions in threatened mammal species (Daszak et al. 2000; Lafferty & Gerber 2002; Smith et al. 2006). Our results demonstrate that several host and parasite characteristics are important for predicting infectious disease risks for threatened mammal. First, the majority (88%) of mammals identified as threatened by parasites were from just two taxonomic orders: artiodactyls and carnivores. Within these clades, host families with the greatest frequency of species threatened by parasites also included all major groups of domesticated livestock and companion animals (including dogs, cats, goats, sheep, cattle, and pigs). By comparison, no bats (0.0% of 1024) and only one rodent species (<0.01% of 2041) were identified as being threatened by parasites. One explanation for this pattern is that close phylogenetic relationships with domesticated mammals, which are globally distributed and maintained at high densities, can intensify the risk of cross\u2010species transmission to related wildlife species. Given that parasites are more likely to be shared or to jump between closely related host species (Brooks & McLennan 1991) and that over 80% of livestock and domesticated carnivore parasites can also infect wildlife (Cleaveland et al. 2001), it is not surprising that species in these lineages suffer more heavily from infectious diseases.",

These parasites included well\u2010known agents such as foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease virus, morbilliviruses that cause canine distemper and rinderpest, and bacteria that cause bovine tuberculosis and anthrax (Table 1). Counter to expectations, 75% of parasites identified as threatening were transmitted by close contact, rather than by arthropod vectors or contact with contaminated soil or water. Although previous studies have highlighted the characteristics of parasites that pose significant health risk to humans and animals (Taylor et al. 2001; Gog et al. 2002; Pedersen et al. 2005), our study represents the first to evaluate these factors in the context of extinction risk. Consistent with these studies (Taylor et al. 2001; Woolhouse et al. 2001), we found that viruses, due to their typically wide host ranges and high mutation rates (Domingo & Holland 1994), are most likely to threaten mammals. This is further supported by our finding that ssRNA viruses, which have higher mutation rates than DNA viruses (Drake et al. 1998), comprised over 70% of the viruses identified as causing declines in threatened mammals.",

This pattern was particularly striking for helminths, which represent the greatest diversity of parasites of wild mammals (Nunn et al. 2003; Ezenwa et al. 2006; Lindenfors et al. 2007). One explanation is that many helminth infections cause sublethal fitness effects or cyclical changes in host abundance, both of which are difficult to quantify in wild mammal populations (Hudson et al. 1998). When combined with other parasites or environmental stressors, helminths could pose significant conservation threats. For example, population declines in bighorn sheep (Ovis candadensis) may have been caused by interactions between stress, lungworm infection (Protostrongylus spp.), and bacteria (Pastuerella spp.), which lead to pneumonia outbreaks that resulted in high mortality and low reproductive success (Forrester 1971; Jones & Worley 1994). Further investigation of the effects of helminths and other macroparasites is needed to understand their role in mammalian extinction risk.",

Similarly, species threatened by parasites may have been better studied for parasites than other threatened mammals. Nevertheless, we found no evidence that mammals identified as threatened by parasites were better studied for infectious disease, had higher parasites species richness, or differed in four key traits relative to other threatened mammals. Instead, phylogenetic relatedness to domesticated animals posed the greatest risk in terms of parasite\u2010mediated declines.",

Our study revealed that few mammal species have been identified as threatened by parasites (IUCN 2006), which is consistent with a recent review of parasite\u2010mediated extinction risk across plants and animals (Smith et al. 2006). One contributing factor could be a lack of accessible information on infectious diseases in threatened mammal populations. Published studies of parasite infections in natural populations were available for <40% of the world's most threatened primates, carnivores, and artiodactyls. Furthermore, over 25% of the mammals classified as threatened by parasites by the IUCN had little or no published information concerning the effects of disease on wild populations. For example, an Australian marsupial (the Dibbler [Parantechinus apicalis]) was identified as threatened by parasites, but literature searches revealed instead that a plant pathogen (Phytopthora cinnamomi) was negatively affecting native plants in its preferred habitat (Friend 2004). For West Indian manatees (Trichechus manatus) and marine otters (Lontra felina), infectious disease was perceived to be a future risk even though no current parasite\u2010mediated declines have been reported.",

Vaccination of domesticated animal reservoirs could be an effective control strategy for minimizing the transmission of pathogens to wildlife hosts (Lafferty & Gerber 2002). Outbreaks caused by many of the reported parasites resulted from direct contact with domesticated animals, in some cases from infections that would not have spread or persisted in wildlife in the absence of domesticated animals. As one example, rinderpest virus declined dramatically in wild populations of African bovids following the widespread vaccination of domesticated cattle (Plowright 1982). A campaign is currently underway in the Serengeti ecosystem to immunize domesticated dogs against rabies, canine distemper, and parvovirus, with the goal to reduce disease outbreaks in lions, African wild dogs, and bat\u2010eared foxes (Otocyon megalotis) (Cleaveland et al. 2000, 2003). Alternative strategies could focus on minimizing contacts between domestic animal reservoir hosts and endangered wildlife species (Woodroffe 1999), particularly because our results suggest that close contact is a major route of transmission for these harmful parasites. Minimizing cross\u2010species contact could be accomplished through physical barriers that reduce the potential for close contact or by limiting temporal overlap in the use of water resources or grazing habitats. These strategies have been effective in reducing bighorn sheep epidemics, specifically through the construction of buffer zones between agricultural areas and ranges of bighorn sheep (Jessup et al. 1991, 1995).",
