In the Tokyo sarin event, patients arrived at St. Luke\u2019s Emergency Department within 12 minutes of the first hospital notification that there had been an event.2 Large decontamination systems may not be needed because evidence suggests that small numbers of patients (between 5 and 15) usually require hospital decontamination.8 For ED planning, this means that a scalable decontamination process, one that can start small and then immediately ramp up over time, is needed. Emergency departments should use multiple showerheads in their decontamination rooms in addition to outside systems that may range from garden hoses with nozzles to fixed shower systems concreted in place. Decontamination procedures can start immediately with the first arrival of patients, and if the event escalates, the decontamination process continues at the initial sites until the large showers are assembled and ready to go.",

At 9:00 am, the emergency department received initial notification that the Tokyo Fire Department had identified the chemical (incorrectly) as acetonitrile. At 9:40 am, a medical doctor with experience from the previous sarin attack in Matsumoto, Japan, called to advise medical staff to suspect sarin, and the hospital began treating patients with the appropriate MARK 1 sarin antidote kits at that time.

Information from patients about the event and their signs and symptoms will be the primary sources of data that ED personnel receive to determine what agent the patients may have been exposed to. Staff must have the ability to start decontamination or isolation procedures as soon as they are suspicious that an exposure occurred, and this clinical suspicion needs to be based in appropriate training. Training needs to include not only basic classes reviewing agent characteristics but also the application of that knowledge into practical considerations, such as how and when to implement ED response procedures. This can be accomplished through interactive classes, role playing, and regular drilling. It is crucial that the ED charge nurses have regular practice with the decision-making steps that they will need to perform when they believe a patient has been exposed to a chemical or infectious agent. Staff should not experience repercussions for \u201cjumping the gun\u201d if their suspicions of contamination turn out to be erroneous.",

The teams often arrive late and leave their hospitals with less coverage. EMS usually has well-established and well-drilled mass casualty plans that do not include the use of an ad hoc team; the arrival of uncoordinated volunteers on the scene detracts from scene coordination rather than enhancing it. The hospital teams might be better utilized by staying at their hospital or moving to more heavily impacted hospitals unless specifically requested by EMS. EMS should then have a clear plan in place to maximize the use of the teams by directing them to patients needing critical medical interventions.",

These centers are established to provide an assessment area before entry into the emergency department and to limit ED admissions to those patients with significant signs and symptoms of infection. These centers can be constructed as stand-alone structures or retrofitted onto an existing entryway. Over a period of 3 weeks, National Taiwan University Hospital screened 754 patients and admitted 63 at its screening unit, and over a period of 1 month, a Toronto teaching hospital screened over 1,000 patients and admitted 70.26, 27 The screening centers should have patients spaced sufficiently apart and proper PPE in place to limit the potential spread of the agent in overcrowded conditions. On the basis of established local public health criteria, patients testing positive will be sent to home quarantine or admitted. (In Ontario, with a population of 11 million, 10,000-20,000 people were home quarantined.)28\n",
