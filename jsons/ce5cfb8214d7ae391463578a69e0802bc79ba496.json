The speed at which this new open data has disseminated worldwide shows how clearly important to the community open access and open data is. It is also evident to us that, being a proponent of making raw research data open and available, Genome Biology needs to reiterate that all datasets on which the conclusions of the paper rely should be available to readers, and where there is a community established norm for data sharing. we all know, scientific research is a process of trial and error, and so is scientific publication.

Aside from pushing the privacy protection technologies in genomic data sharing [1, 2] , Genome Biology accepts gated repositories for human genomics data. We acknowledge that different regions and funding bodies may have their own specific requests for how human data should be handled and made available, and we do honor these as much as possible. Authors have an ethical and legal responsibility to respect participants' rights to privacy and their identities. We understand regional data regulation should be interpreted in a case by case manner, as data from different populations commonly have different codes for repository requirement and safety concerns. We urge our authors to read and understand their regional data regulations specific to their own project before preparing manuscripts; this includes a few European regions and China [3, 4] . For instance, according to the latest version of Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the management of human genetic resources [4] , China continues to encourage institutions, institutes, medical centers, and companies to engage in international collaboration of researches involving human genetic resources. However, to make sure the pertinent data can be shared in a regulation-compliant manner, authors are required to file the data sharing plan and have it recorded online by the relevant authorities first.",

Genome Biology fully supports and encourages preprint posting of papers for the main reason that it encourages openness of research and more scientific discussion. We encourage our authors to post to a preprint server such as bioRxiv (http://www.biorxiv.com) when we send a paper for review; however, we notice an increasing number of papers that are submitted directly from bioRxiv using B2J, or already posted on a preprint at the time of submission.
