Non-communicable diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular stroke also cause considerable mortality, but despite the increase in global burden, non-communicable diseases are unlikely to have the same escalation rate and health impact as climate change will have on the global population. There is clearly a need for an internationally coordinated response to infectious diseases outbreaks, and we fully support the mandate of WHO to declare public health emergencies for such events. However, given the high mortality that will result from climate change, the impact it will have on health systems, and the need to mitigate its effects immediately, we argue that climate change warrants similar treatment.",

Climate change thus induces \u201ca potential for disease\u201d by increasing the conditions suitable for disease transmission. The number of people newly at risk of potential viral transmission by the mosquito species Aedes aegypti and A albopictus will approach one billion within this century.20 This includes dengue virus, for which global vectorial capacity is increasing \u201cin step\u201d with global carbon dioxide emissions, and yellow fever; both these diseases are mentioned in annex 2 of the International Health Regulations as having the potential to constitute an international public health emergency.21 Country borders offer little defence against the global expansion and redistribution of disease, so climate change requires a coordinated international response.",

We therefore support a recent call for WHO to convene \u201creview conferences\u201d of its health regulations to consider how best to tackle health emergencies related to climate change.23 In relation to the covid-19 outbreak, one commentator suggested that the regulations\u2019 \u201call-or-nothing approach\u201d towards declaring an international health emergency should include a spectrum of alerts from category 1 to category 5.24 We argue that such flexibility should extend to include threats to global public health that are not disease specific.",
