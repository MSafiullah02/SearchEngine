Soon thereafter, travel restrictions and closures of schools and nonessential businesses followed. Federal authorities recommended that hospitals and ambulatory facilities limit elective surgeries to limit exposure to patients, visitors, and staff; prevent unnecessary local travel; conserve supplies for urgent and emergent cases; conserve personal protective equipment (PPE), which are already in short supply; and conserve hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds to accommodate the anticipated influx (surge) of critically ill COVID-19 patients.",

The ASFs that choose to shut down normal operations can contribute by providing their supplies to hospitals that need them.

The Ambulatory Surgery Center Association has a checklist for ASFs to document their inventory (Figure) . 2 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has now become a global pandemic.

This is particularly important because it is postulated that asymptomatic patients can transmit the disease during the incubation period. 8, 9 Of note, the likelihood of COVID-19 transmission from asymptomatic patients is low. 10 Although the choice of anesthetic technique generally depends on the procedure and the patient, preventing transmission of coronavirus through aerosolization should be a major consideration. It is preferable to avoid airway instrumentation and attendant aerosol generation, thereby increasing the risk of airborne transmission. Therefore, whenever possible, local/regional anesthesia with minimal or no sedation is preferred.

The Draeger anesthesia workstation uses a 0.2 \u03bcm filter in the water trap but the viral filtration efficiency has yet to be determined. If an airway filter option is not available, and the efficiency of water trap filter cannot be confirmed, a 0.2 \u03bcm drug injection filter similar to that used in epidural analgesia kits can be placed between the water trap and the patient and reused after wiping the surface. 12 If it is not possible to filter the sampled air for expired CO 2 , it may be necessary to monitor ventilation by other means such as a precordial stethoscope or stethoscope placed on the neck.",

Alternatively, he recommends sterilization of the N95 masks by hanging them in the oven (without contacting metal) at 70\u00b0C (158\u00b0F) for 30 minutes, as it is reported that COVID-19 cannot survive at 65\u00b0C (149\u00b0F) for 30 minutes. 15, 16 Dr Tsai does not recommend use of ultraviolet light or sunlight, as these might degrade the material and the elastic bands.",
