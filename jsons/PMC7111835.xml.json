This drawback, together with the requirement of (\u2212)-pseudoephedrine as the chiral auxiliary, promoted us to develop a new route to the lactone 4 by direct alkylation of lactone 6. This lactone could be prepared using l-valine as the starting material.",

After l-valine was treated with benzyl bromide under the assistance of potassium carbonate, the resultant ester was reduced with LAH to provide N,N-dibenzyl valinol 7. Swern oxidation of 7 followed by nucleophilic attack by a lithium reagent derived from propiolic acid ethyl ester provided anti-aminoalcohol 8 in 70% yield, together with syn-aminoalcohol 9 in 13.5% yield. The stereochemistry of 8 was assigned by transformation of it to known lactone 16 as described below. Since the diastereoselectivity (8:9\n = 5.2) was not good at the aldol reaction step, we attempted to improve it using suitable additives. It was found low diastereoselectivity was still encountered when TiCl4,5 Al(OPr-i)3,5 or MgCl2\n6 was used. However, the ratio of 8 to 9 jumped to 9:1 when 2 equiv of HMPA6 was added. Unfortunately, the yield was only 58% in this case. Consequently we still employed the initial condition to get aldol products when the reaction was scaled up.",

Treatment of 12 with acetic acid in toluene delivered the lactone 6\n7 in 89% yield. In order to convert the anti-aminoalcohol 8 to 6, its C4 stereochemistry should be reversed. Accordingly, hydrogenolysis of 8 followed by in situ protection produced alcohol 10, which was transformed into its mesylate 11 with mesyl chloride. It was expected to obtain the lactone 6 by simple lactonization of 11 through an intramolecular SN2 reaction. However, we found that a mixture of 6 and its 5-epimer 13 were isolated under various conditions such as exposure of 11 to NaOH in ethanol or DMF. The ratio of 6 and 13 was about 2:1\u20131:1, which implied that SN1 reaction might also take place. Thus, we had to give up this protocol for assembling 6 from the alcohol 10.",
