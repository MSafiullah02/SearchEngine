These results however were not statistically significant. As our study was not powered for symptom outcomes, particularly for wheeze (OR, 2.7, P = .09) and cough (OR, 2.7, P = .11), the moderate effect sizes were considered a type II error and suggest larger studies are warranted in future. These findings are similarly documented following infant RSV and HRV bronchiolitis, where RVIs have been associated with subsequent asthma and atopy.12, 13 While the pathogenesis of early\u2010life respiratory viruses remains unknown, some studies have implicated excess type 2 immunity and aberrant lung remodeling.30, 31 The complexity of this however, is further highlighted by studies which suggest that inherent susceptibility to any type of respiratory episode, including bacterial infections, is more important than viral triggers.32 In our study, only one child had a positive bronchodilator response and atopy was low in both the viral and control groups. This suggests a different phenotype of disease in our cohort, who were older but more severely immunosuppressed. We hypothesize cancer survivors may have suffered direct tissue damage or neuroimmune modifications of respiratory mucosa following the RVI; however, further study is required to examine the role of other pathogens such as bacteria. As with infant bronchiolitis, there also remains the question of cause and effect: whether RVIs during chemotherapy predispose respiratory morbidity, or if children with pre\u2010existing defects are more susceptible to RVIs.",

Alternatively, our lung function tests only assessed static physiology and may not have stressed the pulmonary system to detect functional abnormalities as possible with cardiopulmonary exercise testing.

This literature predates 2000, and mostly investigated patients treated with recognized pulmonary\u2010toxic therapies (HSCT or chest radiation).

In contrast to our study, Tantawy et al41 reported elevated R5 in 25% of their cohort which may be due to their heterogeneous patient cohort and a different chemotherapy regimen. There is a paucity of literature describing the long\u2010term lung function in contemporary cancer survivors treated without established pulmonary\u2010toxic therapies.

To preserve a parsimonious model, only covariates with a univariate P > 0.1 could be retained in the multivariate regression analysis. Thus some clinically important factors, such as \u201cage at diagnosis\u201d were not retained as they were weak predictors in our small sample size, and require larger studies to power statistical models that can meaningfully test the impact of covariates. As this was a retrospective study, we relied on past medical records of microbiological testing on sputum samples collected from patients at the time of therapy. These data were used to classify the \u201cviral\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d groups, and exclude children with proven respiratory bacterial and fungal infections, although sputum samples would not have been routinely tested on all patients. Incomplete medical records also precluded characterization of RVIs by severity, and as upper or lower tract infections. Furthermore, the microbiological methods used to isolate respiratory viruses were variable, where cell culture and immunofluorescence had limitations in the diagnosis of specific viruses such as HRV and HMPV as compared to newer molecular techniques. Thus, our viral cohort may only represent children with severe infections warranting investigation, or only those with viruses detectable by the microbiological method available at time of testing. As these children did not receive pulmonary assessments prior or during therapy, we also lack longitudinal data to evaluate trends in pulmonary function or the chronology of respiratory symptoms with respect to therapy.",
