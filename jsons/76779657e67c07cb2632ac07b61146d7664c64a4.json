Its coding region constitutes less than 50% of the complete gene length, enabling SH gene to be highly variable and the SH protein highly conserved. In standard HRSV molecular epidemiology studies, solely sequences of the second hypervariable region of the glycoprotein gene (HVR2) are analyzed. To what extent do the strains identical in HVR2 differ elsewhere in genomes is rarely investigated. Our goal was to investigate whether diversity and inter-genotype differences observed for HVR2 are also present in the SH gene. Methods: We sequenced 198 clinical samples collected within a limited area and time frame. In this HRSV collection, rapid and significant changes in HVR2 occurred. Results: Over 20% of strains from this pool (containing HRSV genotypes NA1, ON1, GA5, BA9 and BA10) would be incorrectly assumed to be identical to another strain if only the HVR2 region was analysed. The majority of differences found in SH gene were located in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR). Seven indels were detected, one was genotype GA5 specific. An in-frame deletion of 9 nucleotides (coding for amino acids 49-51) was observed in one of group A strains. Fifteen different SH protein sequences were detected; 68% of strains possessed the consensus sequence and most of others differed from the consensus in only one amino acid (only 4 strains differed in 2 amino acids). The majority of differing amino acids in group A viruses had the same identity as the corresponding amino acids in group B strains. When analysis was restricted to strains with identical HVR2 nucleotide sequences and differing SH protein sequences, 75% of differences observed in the SH ectodomain were located within region coding for amino acids 49-51.",

It partitions HRSV strains in over 15 group A and over 20 group B genotypes. Regarding phylogeny, SHseg in not as informative as HVR2. E.g. in analyses based on HVR2, ON1 and NA1 strains are placed on different branches, even when one copy of the duplicated segment is excluded from the analysis [23] . Still, basing molecular epidemiology studies only on HVR2 may be quite misleading. In our pool of HRSV strains, over 20% of them would be incorrectly assumed to be identical to another strain if only the HVR2 region was analysed. An alternative HRSV genotyping scheme has recently been proposed [24] , based on the complete G protein ectodomainwhich is twice longer than HVR2. Although this would increase the discrimination between strains, it is still focused solely on one protein gene. The G gene is non-representative of the HRSV genome, as it is marked by elevated substitution rates (attributed to relaxed selective constraints [25] ) and a flip-flop substitution pattern [26] . Broadening the target genome sequence to SH (whose length in our analysis was 401-411 nts in group A, 412 or 413 in group B) or only to SH 5' UTR (in our analysis, this was a region of 83 or 84 nts in group A, 85 in group B) would provide better insight into the interrelation between molecular epidemiology and molecular and evolutionary dynamics. After the translation of our genomic sequences, only 15 different protein sequences were obtained. Although group A and group B strains diverged approximately 350 years ago [27] , the majority of amino acids which differ from the consensus in group A have the same identity as corresponding amino acids in group B strains. This indicates that the variability of the SH protein is not only low, but is also restricted. Based on the fact that HVR2 has the highest evolutionary rates, we concentrated on strains possessing the same HVR2 nucleotide sequences, but still differing in their SH protein sequences. Those are the strains most likely to be highly similar and therefore we hypothesized that the observed differences could be a result of selective pressure. Out of 4 sets of strains with differences in the SH ectodomain, in 3 sets the differences were in SH protein region 49-51. In fact, besides S35F the only amino acid differences observed in group A strains which differed from the group B consensus, were located within 49-51 region. In our viral pool, which was very limited both geographically and temporally, 6.7% of group A strains and 51.3% of group B strains possessed mutation in region 49-51.",

The deletion was found only in this strain that caused a bronchiolitis in a 2-month-old child. The deletion was confirmed by 3 independent RNA isolations and preparations of DNA for sequencing. During the same HRSV epidemic, strain RSV3234-12 (from November 2012) was detected in a sample from a 4-month-old child with bronchiolitis. The two strains are identical in the SH, G an F genes, except for the fact that RSV3234-12 does not possess this deletion in the SH gene. Other genomic regions were not sequenced. In group A strains, H51 (which is missing from RSV5-13) is a crucial residue in the regulation of SH ion channel activity [30] . Together with H22, H51 plays a key role in the opening and closing mechanism of the SH pentameric pore, since they are located in strategic places within the chains, close to the N-and C-termini [30, 31] . An alternative amino acid at position 51 (Y, a non-basic amino acid) has been reported before, in a Brazilian GA5 strain from 2004 [28] , but so far there were no reports of the deletion observed in RSV5-13. In vitro experiments regarding the functionality of the SH protein from RSV5-13 or modelling studies that would compare its structure to other HRSV SH proteins have not been performed.",
