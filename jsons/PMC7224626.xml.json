Limited supply of positive controls was available from the WHO from Charit\u00e9 Laboratories, Berlin, via European Virus Archive Global (EVAg). A need was sensed to provide positive control to all laboratories in the national network of Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDLs) for real-time RT-PCR.

The real-time PCR screening assay (E gene) was also established at the 13 VRDLs as part of ICMR's efforts to expand testing to VRDLs closer to major airports3. However, due to screening of low number of samples, the repeated use of positive controls was made. The supply of IVT RNA as positive control for E gene from EVAg was limited and had non-consistent performance when diluted further. In addition, the control for RdRp assay was from a SARS coronavirus Frankfurt 1 isolate, which yielded weak signal with RdRp Wuhan-specific probe. This necessitated the development of an indigenous IVT RNA for E and RdRp. In addition, majority of the WHO screening protocols (5 of 6) are based on N gene targeting different nucleotide positions and require multiple specific positive controls4. Hence, an IVT RNA was designed for entire N gene which would be compatible for multiple protocols.",
