When the Black Death pandemic was ravaging Europe during the Middle Ages, the only sound advice given to the citizens was \u201cflee early, flee far, return late\u201d. As reflected in the Introduction of Boccaccio's Decameron, the citizens of Florence \u201cdecided that the only remedy for the pestilence was to avoid it \u2026 [that] none ought to stay in a place thus doomed to destruction\u201d. Modern medicine does not have to resort to such extreme measures of public health, and nor does it ascribe the occurrence of epidemics to a certain alignment of the stars, the will of God, harmful vapours, or the poisoning of wells by non-believers. Surveillance systems make the early detection of disease outbreaks possible through data supplied by sentinel clinics, or by the use of syndromic surveillance (e.g. Web queries, other forms of Internet biosurveillance, over-thecounter drug sales, or school absence records) [1]. We would argue, however, that timely prediction of epidemics before they occur, and accurate forecasts of their course in their early phase, remain, by and large, unreliable.",

In 1980, treatment was available and effective, and it seemed reasonable to include TB in the list of \u201cdisappearing and declining diseases'\u2019 in Britain [2]. The authors were naturally unaware of the fact that the AIDS pandemic was already making hundreds of thousands of people worldwide susceptible to a disease previously considered to be a remnant of the 19th century [3]. The surge in the incidence of TB and the appearance of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB in eastern Europe in recent decades is causally linked to a wide variety of actors: the AIDS pandemic, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the increase in intravenous drug abuse there. Predicting the occurrence of these epidemiological and political phenomena was not possible in 1980. Beijing genotype strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis now account for approximately 50% of TB cases in China, and are spreading worldwide [4]. This genotype has been observed to spread more successfully in the population than other M. tuberculosis strains. The reasons for this are incompletely understood [4]. Will this genotype change the epidemiology of TB? Will vaccination and treatment trigger the appearance of other successful genotypes? Nearly 20 years after the first description of the M. tuberculosis Beijing genotype, and more than 30 years after the recurrence of the TB pandemic, we still lack elementary biological and epidemiological data to help with TB control.",

However, the virus itself has the capacity to mutate, and human society changes continuously, so that predictions cannot be based on such historical associations. If predictions were to rely on past observations, one would expect adults aged \u226565 years, who are known to be susceptible to both severe influenza and pneumococcal infections, to have extremely high mortality rates during influenza pandemics. Hygienic conditions today, however, are different from those of 1919, pneumococcal sepsis being the exception among patients with influenza. During the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza virus pandemic, patients aged \u226565 years were found to have death rates 81% lower than expected in a regular influenza season [5]. In fact, obesity, not ageing, was found to be a significant risk factor for severe disease [5, 6]. Not only was the influenza virus itself different, but it also interacted with other viruses in important ways. In France, for instance, a rhinovirus epidemic was found to delay the onset of the influenza pandemic, which in itself delayed the onset of the respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis season [6, 7, 8]. To complicate things further, increasing evidence suggests that some bacterial infections can also increase the susceptibility of patients to viral infections [9].",

The interaction between the Anopheles mosquito vector, the Plasmodium falciparum parasite and humans is a good example of such complexity. In recent years, long-lasting insecticide-treated bed-nets have been distributed in many sub-Saharan African countries, following evidence from randomized controlled trials that these reduce P. falciparum malaria prevalence, morbidity, and mortality [10]. Although it was reasonable to assume that the continuation of such efforts would lead to a gradual and predictable decrease in malaria morbidity, the results of a recent longitudinal study performed in Senegal highlight the problematic nature of such simplistic forecasts. In this study, the average incidence density of malaria attacks, which was 5.45 per 100 person-months before the distribution of treated bed-nets, decreased to 0.41 immediately afterwards, only to increase again to 4.57 per 100 person-months 27\u201320 months after the initial intervention, despite continued use of the bed-nets. The prevalence of knockdown resistance mutation, which confers reduced sensitivity of the Anopheles vector to pyrethroid insecticides, increased from 8% in 2007 to 48% in 2010. The mosquitoes were shown to become somewhat more aggressive during the early evening, thereby avoiding the need to \u2018confront\u2019 bed-nets [11]. Unpredictable events such as these undermine the various attempts to model and predict trends in malaria control and eradication [12, 13].",

Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), for example, was considered to be a candidate for eradication in most African countries in the 1960s. The disease re-emerged later on, despite the availability of effective, if somewhat toxic, treatment options. The reasons for the increase in HAT incidence included factors such as political instability in some African countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic, failing healthcare systems, neglect of existing HAT diagnosis and vector control programmes, lack of investment in new drug development by pharmaceutical companies, and the consideration of withdrawal of existing drugs on economic grounds [15].

Most emerging infectious diseases and nearly all pandemics were caused by \u2018classic\u2019 zoonotic pathogens (e.g. the plague), or by pathogens that were initially confined to animals or had limited potential for causing human infections, but then mutated, crossed the species barrier, and disseminated globally (e.g. SARS coronavirus, and human immunodeficiency virus) [16]. A list containing animal pathogens that could potentially trigger a new pandemic can be compiled; surveillance aimed at detecting an outbreak of a disease caused by one of these pathogens should hence be continuous.

For example, it is common to assume a rectangular age distribution, with most individuals in a population reaching old age, a typical observation in high-income countries with low infant mortality rates. The poor and the displaced, however, are the populations most affected by epidemics such as AIDS, TB, epidemic typhus, or cholera, and the age distribution of these populations is vastly different. Another simplification often used in the construction of deterministic models rests on the assumption of homogeneous mixing of the population, i.e. on the premise that all individuals in a certain population associate randomly with each other. A recent mumps epidemic in New York and New Jersey affected 3502 patients, 89% of whom were fully immunized. The assumption of homogeneous mixing of the population seems absurd, as 97% of cases occurred in the orthodox Jewish population group; 78% of them were male, and adolescents attending religious schools were disproportionately affected [22]. More complex stochastic models, which take variability and chance into account, contain less epidemiologically improbable assumptions, but are best applied to smaller populations, and require the inclusion of more variables, greatly complicating their use.",

The 2003 SARS epidemic provides a good example. Early models suggested that isolation of contacts before symptom onset would be beneficial in controlling the spread of the disease [23]. Contact tracing and quarantine of asymptomatic people is, however, a daunting task for any public health system, and only approximately 5% of contacts who eventually became ill were in fact isolated before becoming symptomatic [24]. An analysis of the real-life impact of contact tracing and quarantine during the SARS crisis will, in all likelihood, show that timely isolation of symptomatic patients would have achieved nearly identical results, with much greater efficiency. Quarantine of asymptomatic contacts contributed little to SARS control, but probably led to excess costs, increased psychological stress among those quarantined, and a lingering misunderstanding of how the epidemic was actually contained [24].",

If an R\n0 of 2.6\u20133.2 had been used, one would have expected 30 000\u201310 000 000 SARS cases in China alone. Eventually, only 782 cases were reported, suggesting a much lower R\n0 [26]. At the beginning of the SARS epidemic, during the course of a \u2018super-spreading event', one person infected as many as 300 people [25]. Eventually, the reproduction number dropped dramatically. Such a wide variation in R\n0 values demonstrates how prone models are to errors when they use limited data available during the initial phases of an outbreak, based mostly on case reports.

William Farr, a British doctor and epidemiologist, based this model on his observations of smallpox and cholera epidemics in 19th-century London. The use of the same assumptions for AIDS, a disease that is different in nearly every epidemiological aspect, has led the authors to grossly underestimate AIDS incidence in the USA [28].

The estimated reproduction number (defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a single infectious person) of the smallpox virus, a potential bioterrorist weapon, was used in constructing a model aimed at calculating the cumulative total number of smallpox cases after deliberate exposure [30]. The authors assumed that the transmission rate would be either 1.5 or 3.0 per person, that there would be an unlimited \u2018supply\u2019 of smallpox-susceptible persons, that exactly ten persons would initially be infected, and that no preventive intervention would be implemented. When transmission rates of either 1.5 or 3.0 were used, the number of individuals presumed to become infected within 180 days fluctuated between 2190 and 2.2 million. After 365 days, the predicted number of infections was 224 000 vs. a theoretical 774 billion. These gargantuan differences illustrate the inability of models to provide accurate estimates a priori, even if several simplifying assumptions are made. Active surveillance of smallpox cases and the use of real-time data for model calibration will provide more reliable estimates. In the meantime, models describing bioterrorist smallpox attacks will yield doomsday scenarios for pessimists, and \u2018merely\u2019 unpleasant public health nuisance scenarios for optimists.",

Most models used in epidemiological research still concentrate on one, known, pathogen, which causes a single disease in a well-defined population. It seems, however, that the reality at the microorganism level is much more complex, as organisms not only mutate, but continuously interact with the environment and with a large number of other organisms [31, 32]. Indicator-based surveillance methods and, more recently, Internet biosurveillance systems can detect an outbreak of an infection more rapidly than ever before. Mathematical models play an important role in helping healthcare systems to respond to ongoing epidemics or plan the logistics of various theoretical scenarios, and were used in Haiti during the cholera epidemic, with real-time surveillance data [33]. Accurate predictions of epidemics before they occur are, however, quite unlikely to become the norm. Forecasting the course of epidemics is, to put it in Mark Twain's words, indeed \u201cfull of risks\u201d.",
