Approximately 90% of neonates with congenital CMV infection are \u201casymptomatic,\u201d meaning that they are well-appearing and have no clinically apparent signs of disease detected at birth. Since these infants have a normal physical examination, they often are not evaluated with laboratory or neuroimaging studies. In some cases, abnormalities detected on such tests, if performed, may reclassify them as \u201csymptomatic,\u201d thereby increasing the risk of hearing loss and disabilities from the 5 to 10% seen in asymptomatic infants [7, 8]. Moreover, recognition of abnormalities may identify neonates who could benefit from antiviral therapy. However, it remains unknown how often neonates with clinically inapparent CMV infection have subtle abnormalities detected on more complete evaluation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the frequency of abnormal findings on laboratory, ophthalmologic, neuroimaging, and audiologic evaluation performed on neonates who had a normal physical examination and were diagnosed with congenital CMV infection, the majority of which occurred in the setting of recognized primary maternal infection.",

Only four infants who had more than one neuroimaging test performed had abnormalities on at least one of them (Table 3). Cranial computerized tomography was abnormal in one of two infants, in which it was performed, and it demonstrated thalamic calcifications when the cranial ultrasound showed lenticulostriate vasculopathy (Table 3, patient #3). Similarly, MRI showed thalamic calcifications on one infant whose cranial ultrasound demonstrated lenticulostriate vasculopathy (Table 3, patient #3), while in a second infant (Table 3, patient #2), it showed periventricular calcifications and temporal lobe hyperlucency even though the ultrasound was normal.",

As universal screening for congenital CMV infection is being discussed and anticipated in the near future [29, 30], the need for such evaluation needs to be assessed and included as part of potential health benefits and cost analyses [31]. From this study, the performance of a complete evaluation (Table 5) may lead to institution of antiviral therapy to improve hearing and possibly neurodevelopmental outcomes in some infants [32\u201334].",

Since the study included infants born since 1996, there may be a time bias with respect to management of these infants, as antiviral therapy has become more accepted with convenient oral administration. The latter may be a likely reason for the valganciclovir treatment of three infants in Buenos Aires who had a normal evaluation. In addition, 62% of the mothers in this convenience sample of CMV-infected infants were diagnosed with CMV during the pregnancy, and therefore the infants may have been more likely to have abnormalities than if they had been born to mothers with CMV reactivation. Nevertheless, 90% of these infants would have been expected to be \u201casymptomatic\u201d as their physical examination and growth parameters suggested. Regardless, abnormalities detected on evaluation were not infrequent, suggesting that optimal classification of CMV-infected neonates to predict risk of sensorineural hearing loss will require such testing. In addition, infants did not have blood CMV DNA PCR testing that may help predict hearing outcomes [35]. Finally, the lack of an uninfected control group of infants may have resulted in an overestimate of the abnormalities attributable to congenital CMV infection, especially among the five preterm infants whose abnormal findings could have been related to prematurity. However, none of the term infants were diagnosed with other conditions that could have explained the abnormalities noted on laboratory, ophthalmologic, and neuroimaging evaluation.",
