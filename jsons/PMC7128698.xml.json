Indoor ferrets may be housed in cages or \u201cferret-proofed\u201d rooms. Minimum cage size should be 9.5 \u00d7 9.5 \u00d7 7-cm high, and should be large enough to provide an area to sleep, eat, exercise, and have a litter box. Aquariums are not suitable for ferrets because they do not allow for adequate ventilation [1]. Ferrets should be allowed to be loose in the home only under supervision. Ferrets are capable of squeezing into very small spaces, into furniture, appliances, and ventilation systems. They also like to chew, and sometimes swallow, rubbery items, pencil erasers, furniture and mattress stuffing, stereo speakers and headphone materials, and pipe insulation [5], [6]. Owners must \u201cferret-proof\u201d the house before allowing their ferrets to run loose.",

Although the exact nutritional requirements of the ferret have not been established, most premium cat foods and ferret diets appear to be adequate for ferrets. Dry foods may be offered ad libitum. It is generally accepted that adult neutered ferrets require 30% to 40% protein, 18% to 20% fat, and 2% fiber in the diet [1], [6], [7]. Breeding animals and kits require diets higher in protein and fat [1]. Carbohydrates are not required in significant amounts and should be limited [6]. High fiber diets should not be fed to ferrets because they increase stool volume, and can induce a relative protein:calorie deficiency [6], [8].",

Some practitioners feel strongly that feeding commercial diets containing poor quality meat proteins or large quantities of plant-based ingredients contributes to the development of eosinophilic gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, insulinoma, urolithiasis, and general unthriftiness [6], [7]. For example, in the United States where most ferrets are fed dry kibbled diets, the incidence of insulinoma is high. In Europe and Australia, many ferrets are fed whole prey items (ie, a \u201cnatural\u201d diet), and the incidence of insulinoma is low. A correlation between diet and the development of certain diseases in ferrets is hypothetical at this point in time, and while the authors do not necessarily advocate abandoning the feeding of premium quality cat foods or ferret foods to ferrets, this controversy demonstrates the need for long-term dietary studies in ferrets. In the future, we may find that the current commercially prepared diets containing cereal and plant-based materials are ultimately not appropriate for the ferret.",

Owners should be asked to remain at the clinic for 30 minutes postvaccination to observe for signs of possible reaction. Clinical signs of a vaccine reaction include: diarrhea that is sometimes bloody, hematuria, dyspnea, vomiting, and fever. The veterinarian should treat the ferret with diphenhydramine HCl (Benadryl) 2 mg/ml intravenously (i.v.) or intramuscularly (i.m.), and dexamethasone 1 mg/kg, i.m. When severe reactions occur, epinephrine can be administered 20 \u03bcg/kg i.v., i.m., subcutaneously (s.c.), and supportive care initiated immediately as for dogs and cats [11]. The veterinarian can discuss reactions, risks, and modification or cessation of vaccine protocols with the client, if indicated.",

Ferrets will have a shorter darker coat in summer and a longer lighter colored coat in winter [6]. As ferrets age, alopecia is likely to become more prominent. Waxing and waning alopecia with or without pruritis may be an indicator of future adrenal disease, which appears to be more prevalent in North American ferrets [13], [14]. Alopecia may occur symmetrically over the tail, may involve only the tail tip, and may also include hind quarters, shoulders, ventrum, or head [14]. Focal hair loss may also be caused by neoplasia (especially mast cell tumors), external parasites, contact dermatitis, or trauma [15]. When clipping an animal for procedures, clients should be told that depending on hair coat cycle, there may not be hair regrowth for weeks to months [6].",

Ferrets may also present with sudden collapse, lethargy, a \u201cglazed\u201d expression, or salivation. Episodes may last minutes to hours [12], [33]. Severe signs include tachycardia, tremoring, hypothermia, and subsequent cerebral hypoxia that can lead to death. A presumptive diagnosis of insulinoma is made when repeated fasting blood glucose levels are below 70 mg/dL [14]. Other less common causes of hypoglycemia in ferrets include starvation, sepsis, and hepatic disease [14], [33].",

Monthly ivermectin is most commonly used, and year-round therapy may be indicated for endemic areas [10], [28]. It has been recommended that ferrets be heartworm tested prior to starting heartworm preventative; however, there is currently no accurate heartworm test available for the ferret. The occult tests are often not accurate because ferrets usually only have a burden of one to three adult worms [13], [17], [28]. The direct test (Knotts test) may be performed; however, microfilaremia occurs in less than 2% of infected ferrets [28], [36]. Thoracic radiology, and echocardiography have both been useful in the diagnosis of heartworm disease. Treatment of heartworm disease is difficult because most ferrets present to the veterinarian in advanced stages of cardiorespiratory disease at the time of diagnosis [28], [36].",

Tractable ferrets can be lightly restrained on the examination table by placing one hand under the chest and lifting slightly. More energetic ferrets may need to be restrained by scruffing. When scruffing a ferret, use one hand to grasp as much skin as possible over the back of the neck and lift the ferret up, suspending all four legs off the table. Most will promptly relax and offer little resistance. The spine can be supported with the other hand, or the ferret may be reclined against the forearm of the arm the handler is using to scruff the ferret (Fig. 2\n). The rear legs should not be placed on the table top or held; this gives the ferret leverage, and it may struggle. This method of restraint is useful for many procedures including: oral medication administration, vaccination, injections, and subcutaneous fluid administration. Many ferrets yawn when scruffed, which aids in examination of the oral cavity.",
