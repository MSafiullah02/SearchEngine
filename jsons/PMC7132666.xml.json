For example, infection with airborne Francisella tularensis (the causative agent of tularemia) is reported to result from a single microorganism, whose virulence is associated with a cellular capsule.23 Only a few cells of M tuberculosis, with its unique and resistant cell wall structure, are required to overcome normal lung clearance and inactivation mechanisms in a susceptible host. Susceptibility increases through long-term exposure and decreased immune function, which may result from a variety of natural or self-induced predisposing factors such as aging, crowded living conditions, heavy smoking, poor nutrition, and alcoholism. TB epidemics can occur among persons congregated in enclosed spaces, such as homeless shelters, nursing homes, hospitals, schools, prisons, and office buildings. Infectivity and the need for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning engineering controls for TB were demonstrated more than 30 years ago. Experiments were conducted that exposed guinea pigs to air vented from a ward where patients with TB were receiving drug therapy. During a 2-year period, 71 of an average of 156 guinea pigs exposed continuously to the air from a 6-bed TB ward became infected.51 More recently, the contagiousness of M tuberculosis has been reviewed.52\n",

Each year, viral influenza epidemics sweep the globe, some with greater virulence than others. During major epidemics, influenza hospitalizations for persons at high risk may increase two to five times,53 placing health care workers at increased risk for infection. Small infective doses are thought to be responsible because of the rapidity with which the disease spreads throughout a population. The natural airborne transmission of respiratory infection with the coxsackie A virus type 21 was investigated in 2 groups of adult volunteers. One was infected with the virus and the other, not infected and antibody free, was separated from the first by a double-walled, wire screen 4 feet wide.54 Transmission of infection was demonstrated on day 6, as a wave of infection swept the previously uninfected group. Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that is spread by the airborne route. The infective dose is small, and as few as 4 doses per minute from an infected person can initiate an epidemic.55 Additionally, rubella (German measles) and varicella (chickenpox) viruses can be readily spread by aerosols in indoor air.",

In particular, many laboratory investigations have established that the effect of relative humidity on airborne microorganisms is an important but unpredictable factor. A study by Harper62 investigated the survival (for as long as 23 hours) of 4 viruses (vaccinia, influenza A, polio, and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis) aerosolized at varying temperatures and relative humidities in the dark. He found that in general viral survival at each relative humidity was better at lower temperature than at higher temperature. In addition, vaccinia, influenza, and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis viruses survived better at low relative humidity (17% to 25%), whereas polio viruses showed greatest survival at high relative humidity (80% to 81%). Another study63 investigated the survival of 3 aerosolized human respiratory viruses (adenoviruses 4 and 7 and parainfluenza 3) in static chambers at 3 relative humidities (20%, 50%, 80%) and found that the adenoviruses survived better at 80% relative humidity, whereas the parainfluenza virus survived better at 20% relative humidity. The studies were carried out with aerosols with mass median diameters of about 2.0 \u03bcm. Davis et al,64 conducting dynamic aerosol studies with adenovirus 12 at 28\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C and 89%, 51%, and 32% relative humidity, found that survival increased as relative humidity increased and that the same relationship was present for the recovery of the virus from the lungs of exposed newborn hamsters. Schaffer et al65 investigated effects of different means of virus propagation (cell cultures, egg cultures) on stability of influenza A virus at midrange relative humidity (50% to 80%) and showed varying survival to be related to method of propagation. More recently, Ijaz et al,66 looking at survival of airborne human coronavirus 229E at different conditions of temperature (20\u00b0C and 6\u00b0C) and relative humidity (30%, 50%, 80%), found that maximum survival of the aerosolized virus was extremely temperature dependent at 80% relative humidity.

Efficient aerosol sampling methods and techniques for the collection of M tuberculosis from indoor air have not yet been described. Other airborne mycobacteria have been successfully recovered from the outdoor air, however, with impactor samplers with specified, enriched media.73 A variety of aerosol sampling techniques and analysis procedures that have been used for the recovery of human viruses have been reviewed.69, 74 The scope of the problem of sampling for airborne pathogens is exemplified by research results with natural aerosols of coxsackie A-21 virus.75 It was found that if individuals harbored 104 median tissue culture infectious dose of virus/ml oral secretions, sneezed 100 times in a closed room (70,000 L), and atomized 5.9 \u00d7 10\u20136 ml secretions with each sneeze, 12,000 L of air would have to be sampled to recover 1 median tissue culture infectious dose of virus.",

M phlei is nonpathogenic for human beings, is a rapidly growing and pigmented environmental mycobacterium, and has been found to be 10 times more resistant to UV radiation than virulent M tuberculosis.78 Its generation as an aerosol, perhaps in artificial sputum, would need to be assessed in the laboratory with respect to its resultant airborne characterization. Additionally, the appropriate collection medium and bioaerosol samplers would also need to be determined.",

Active removal involves the use of devices with media filters or electronic air cleaners, such as the use of portable high-efficiency particulate air filtration units in the rooms of patients with TB, whereas passive removal involves mechanisms such as particle settling, ion diffusion charging, thermophoresis, and coalescence.81 Dilution control involves the reduction of airborne contaminants by the introduction of less contaminated air into the occupied space; this may occur through natural or mechanical ventilation.",

Patients with active TB can be housed in negative-pressure rooms, required to wear respirators, or placed in laminar-flow beds until shown to be noninfectious. Sources can also be managed through a program of building maintenance that ensures appropriate and routine inspection of potential sources, such as air intakes and filter banks; heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning unit components; air ducts; cooling towers; and hot water systems. Environmental sources can also be managed through efficient and routine cleaning practices that remove potentially infectious particles and reduce pollutant source reservoirs, such as carpet and other dust-contaminated surfaces. Recent research on indoor pollutant sources and sinks showed positive correlations between airborne dust mass and airborne bacteria and fungi, carpet dust mass and carpet dust fungi, and carpet dust bacteria and airborne bacteria.91 One of the leading causes of nosocomial infectious aerosol transmission is fungal contamination generated by nearby construction and renovation.

This, in combination with source management controls such as treatment booths and respirators, could significantly lower transmission potential in high-risk settings. Similarly, in controlling nosocomial aspergillosis, high air-exchange rates are the most effective, particularly in combination with point-of-use filtration.94 A guide to air exchanges per hour and the time required (in minutes) for removal efficiencies of 90%, 99%, and 99.9% has been published.95 The figures of the guide are helpful but somewhat limited in value, because they assume perfect mixing of the air within the space and do not account for the resuspension of particles that have fallen out and are subsequently stirred up through activity.
