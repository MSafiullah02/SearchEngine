TRIM family proteins, also known as RBCC proteins, contain conserved RING finger, B-box, coiled-coil domains, and a variable C terminus (2). Despite their common domain structure, TRIM proteins play critical roles in distinct cellular processes such as intercellular signaling, innate immunity, transcription, autophagy, and carcinogenesis (3, 4). Members of the TRIM family of E3 ligases exhibit antiviral activities (5, 6). More than 20 TRIM proteins, which affected the entry or release of retrovirus such as human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV), murine leukemia virus (MIV), or avian leucosis virus (ALV), were screened (6). Expression of low amounts of TRIM62 enhanced HIV gene expression and release, and the E3 mutant of TRIM62 inhibited HIV release more potently than the wild-type protein (6). However, TRIM62 from orange-spotted grouper (EcTRIM62) negatively regulated the innate antiviral immune response against fish RNA viruses (7).",

The occurrence of reticuloendotheliosis (RE) has an immunosuppressive effect and REV as the contaminant within vaccines against Marek's Disease (MD) (10), fowlpox (11, 12), and Gallid herpesvirus 2 (GaHV-2) (13), which may lead to vaccination failures and co-incidence of RE with other secondary infectious agents. Since breeder and layer flocks are commonly vaccinated against MD, the possible congenital transmission of REV between chickens was also be taking into account. The occurrence of RE has major economic importance. So far, no effective vaccines have been developed against RE; thus, the only protection remains flock renewal with elimination of affected birds or application of experimental antiviral treatment. In a previous study, we have confirmed that TRIM62 possesses restriction of avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) replication (14). ALV-J is another avian retrovirus. At present, no data are available regarding the role of TRIM62 from chicken in REV infection.",

To identify host cell proteins that interact with TRIM62, we used a tandem affinity purification approach coupled with mass spectrometry-based proteomics technology. These experiments identified 18 cell proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with transiently expressed Flag-tagged TRIM62 (Table 2). Decades of HIV research have testified to the integral role of the actin cytoskeleton in both establishing and spreading the infection (21). Of the TRIM62-interacting cell proteins identified, we focused on cytoskeletal proteins RAB5B and ARPC2. To verify the interaction between TRIM62 and RAB5B/ARPC2, CEF cells were transfected with a plasmid expression Flag-tagged RAB5B/APRC2 before REV infection, immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody, and immunoblotted with anti-TRIM62 antibody. CEF cells were transfected with plasmid or empty vector uninfected with REV and transfected with empty vector infected with REV as control, respectively. Upon REV infection, anti-TRIM62 coprecipitated Flag-tag RAB5B (Figure 5A) and Flag-tag ARPC2 (Figure 5B).",

However, the domains of TRIM proteins played complicated roles in the inhibition of different viruses. Deletion of the PRY-SPRY domain of TRIM62 from human did not compromise its signal transduction properties. Rather, in addition to the RING domain, both B-box and coiled-coil domains were required for NF-\u03baB and AP-1 induction by TRIM62 (5). Thus, the B-box and/or coiled-coil domains that confer oligomerization/dimerization properties (22) are indispensable for TRIM62-mediated signaling (5). The SPRY domain mediated the affinity for the viral capsid and the function of RING domain to TRIM5\u03b1 restriction of retrovirus infection was determined by the target virus (23). The antiviral activity of fish TRIM36 required both RING and SPRY domains (24). The RING and C-terminal tail were essential for TRIM56's antiviral activity against flaviviruses (25). Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of fish TRIM62 on interferon immune and inflammation response to negatively regulate virus replication was also dependent on RING and SPRY domains (7). In our study, this varied expression level of mutants (Figure 3) could be due to variation in transfection and expression efficiency of different plasmids in primary cells. Even though our results demonstrated that RING, B-box, coiled-coil, and SPRY domains contribute to the antiviral activity of chicken TRIM62, the effect of RING and SPRY was more significant than that of B-box and coiled-coil (Figures 4A,B). These results indicated that RING and SPRY domains are related to the antiviral activity of TRIM proteins.",

            "text": "Retroviruses are considered to use vesicular trafficking in infected cells (18, 26, 27). RAB5B is an isoform of RAB5, which is a member of the RAB family, a small GTPase family. RAB5B regulates fusion and motility of early endosomes, and is a marker of the early endosome compartment (28). RAB5B is a major regulator of hepatitis B virus (HBV) production (29). APRC2 is a component of Arp2/3 complex. The T cell-specific deletion of ARPC2 results in compromised peripheral T cell homeostasis (30). T cell survival and proliferation are mediated by complex homeostatic signals. Peripheral T cells are maintained at a constant cell number so that they can efficiently recognize foreign antigens and protect the host from pathogen invasion (31). Thus, of the TRIM62-interacting cell proteins identified, we focused on RAB5B and ARPC2. The interaction between RAB5B/ARPC2 and TRIM62 indicated that they played important roles in TRIM62 negative regulation on REV replication. A detailed understanding of host restriction may lead to antiviral therapies aimed at strengthening the innate immunity to retroviruses at the cellular and molecular level.",

The deletion of RING, B-box, coiled-coil, and SPRY domains partially affected TRIM62's antiviral activity, and the effects of RING and SPRY deletion were more significant than that of B-box and coiled-coil. The results suggested that all domains, RING, B-box, coiled-coil, and SPRY domains, are required for chicken TRIM62 to provide host defense against viral replication. Furthermore, both RAB5B and ARPC2 interacted with TRIM62, and maybe played important roles in TRIM62 negative regulation on REV replication. Our study provided a potential antiviral strategy targeting this novel regulator.",
