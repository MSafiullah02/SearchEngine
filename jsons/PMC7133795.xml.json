The sense of urgency, clear goal-setting, intensified cooperation with countries, and do-what-it-takes mindset that characterise WHO's HIV/AIDS team are echoed in more and more parts of the organisation. The effects of this new approach will be felt in WHO's many other focus areas, including expanded action against a range of non-communicable diseases and cooperation with countries to achieve the health-related Millennium Development Goals. Not only for WHO, but for other health and development institutions and member states, 3 by 5 is a proving ground that will tell us whether we really have the stomach to tackle tough challenges. If we cannot reach 3 by 5, there is no reason to believe we will achieve the Millennium Development Goals. On the other hand, the innovative work strategies and results-focused partnerships we are building to move toward 3 by 5 can enable progress on other key objectives in line with Health For All.",

WHO will expand its technical cooperation with countries to build the health workforce using innovative methods of training, deployment, and supervision of allied and community health workers. For example, WHO's 3 by 5 emergency mission in Kenya found that about 4000 nurses, 1000 clinical officers, 2000 laboratory staff, and 160 pharmacists or pharmacy technicians are currently unemployed in that country (WHO, unpublished). Many of these health workers could quickly receive training that would enable them to take part in HIV/AIDS treatment scale-up.

Solutions to these challenges must take account of national and local specificities and should negotiate a health-care delivery landscape that is more complex than at the time of Alma-Ata. WHO will work closely with countries to shape health-system development strategies that are pro-equity and driven by primary health care. Excellent work in this direction has already been done in some countries, and lessons can be more widely applied. For example, Chile is carrying through a promising reform of the health-care system, with a primary health care focus and explicit strategies for improving equity. These strategies could be applicable in other middle-income countries (see panel 2\n).Panel 2Health-system improvement based on primary health care in a middle-income country: the example of ChileSince 1990, building on Alma-Ata principles, Chile has progressively implemented a primary-health-care approach focused on the community and the family. The country's current health sector reform is explicitly based on primary health care and a pro-equity orientation. Reform measures aim to equip primary care establishments throughout the country as family and community health centres (centros de salud familiar y comunitaria) able to bring complete, integrated care within reach of the whole population. Innovative measures to promote equitable access for marginalised and vulnerable groups have been built in\u2014for example through outreach programmes aimed at rural and indigenous populations. Epidemiological data on usage patterns have been used to redistribute staff and other resources at health facilities to provide more efficient service to vulnerable groups (such as children and older adults), reduce waiting times during peak usage periods, and increase client satisfaction.18 In 2000, 265 health centres (consultorios) extended their opening hours to better meet client demands, enabling a 23% increase in the number of patients seen. By the following year, a total of 483 public-sector health-facilities had adopted the same system. In 2000, 550 primary-care facilities throughout the country improved their responsiveness through measures including remodelling of reception and clinical spaces, introduction of priority service windows, extended opening hours, and prioritisation of clients based on clinical criteria rather than order of arrival. These measures enabled 97% of the facilities to eliminate early morning waiting lines (http://www.minsal.cl).Chile's health sector reform has been combined with decentralisation and has generated a model of local network management (gestion en red) that gives increased autonomy to closely integrated local networks of primary care centres and referral facilities. These locally networked facilities coordinate their activities to achieve service improvements such as minimising the length of time patients must wait for referral appointments. Strong commitment from the country's political leadership has accelerated the reform process. Recently passed legislation guarantees universal access to treatment for 56 conditions which together account for 80% of Chile's mortality. The law stipulates that a patient's total annual copayment will not exceed 20% of the cost of services, nor surpass the equivalent of 1 month's family income (http://www.minsal.cl).",
