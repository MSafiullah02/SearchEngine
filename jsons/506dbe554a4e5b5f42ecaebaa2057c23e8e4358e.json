            "text": "Many major human diseases derive from autoimmune reactions directed against particular organ or tissue antigens, as can be demonstrated by immunohistologic studies. One disease in which a virus-triggered autoimmune phenomenon has been postulated is multiple sclerosis (MS).' The strongest evidence in support of a viral etiology of MS comes from epidemiologic studies that suggest that MS derives from environmental factors operating years before the onset of the clinical manifestations of the disease. This evidence consists of age-specific tables, geographic distribution, and patterns of migration and family clustering of the cases of MS. The hypothesis derived from these studies holds that a patient with MS is exposed at puberty, or shortly thereafter, to an infectious agent that triggers the disease. Besides the epidemiologic evidence, many investigators have found an increase in virus-specific antibodies against certain enveloped viruses in patients with MS, suggesting that these viruses could be candidate causative agents. However, thus far, all attempts at isolation or identification of a particular virus as the cause of MS have failed. This failure is the more perplexing, because a number of viruses have been isolated from the brains of patients with MS, none of which could be unequivocally related to the disease.",

In order for the lymphocytes to find an antigen in the CNS, they must invade its domain and, once there, they must secure a mechanism for identification of the antigens. Recent evidence has been brought forth that astrocytes can act as cells presenting antigens.2\" On the basis of the information, we endeavored to investigate the effects of the two viruses on astrocytes. Both viruses can induce class I1 molecules on cultured astrocytes,2'.22 a property independent of viral replication in the astrocytes because viruses inactivated by ultraviolet irradiation are also effective. Apparently this capacity to induce the Ia antigen depends on direct interaction of the viruses with the cell membranes of the astrocytes. This interpretation has been derived from the observation that monoclonal antibodies directed against the E2 glycoprotein of the JHM virus or against the hemagglutinin of the measles virus prevent the induction of class I1 antigens. It appears, therefore, that either the viruses bind to specific receptors on the cell surface or the cells phagocytize the viruses and the expression of the Ia antigen follows. This mechanism is independent of gamma-interferon. It may be similar to the one described for bacterial endotoxin.23",

Because the brain lacks lymphatic drainage and the so-called blood-brain barrier restricts traffic of lymphocytes and macromolecules, gamma-interferon would not be readily available for the induction of Ia, especially in the early phase of the infection.

In order for the helper T lymphocytes to recognize viral antigens, class I1 antigens probably have to be present on the astrocytes. However, in extremely high constitutive levels of class I1 expression on astrocytes, an inappropriate or excessive presentation of self-antigens and viral antigens may develop, similar to that in autoimmune processes directed against the thyroid gland.'\" This mechanism could well play a role in the JHM-and measles-virus-induced CNS disease in Lewis rats, because as recently shown by us,\" these hyperexpressions of Ia molecules on astrocytes after contact with gamma-interferon or viral particles are genetically regulated.",

This approach can be expected to bring us towards an understanding of the pathogenesis of persistent CNS infections that are associated with demyelination and mediated by immunologic reactions.
