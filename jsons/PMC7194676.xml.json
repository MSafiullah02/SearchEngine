These PPE lessons will be especially important for the PGY-1 class of 2020, as well as some early medical school graduates,[4] as any errors in technique or judgment can have significant consequences.",

Access to COVID-19 testing for both HCW and patients is variable, and testing policies differ by region and institution. It is critical that residents who experience symptoms suggestive of a COVID-19 infection self-quarantine, only return to work after cessation of symptoms, and obtain testing if available. Until access to testing increases, clinicians should assume patients requiring an operation have COVID-19 until proven otherwise and take the proper precautions. Urology residents should exercise precautions in the operating room, as bag mask ventilation, endotracheal intubation, and laparoscopic surgery are aerosol-generating procedures that carry an increased risk of airborne viral transmission. Resident surgeons should leave the room during intubation when possible, wear proper PPE, avoid excessive use of electrocautery, and suction surgical smoke liberally.[5] Hospitals should develop protocols for testing patients going to the operating room (OR) based on testing availability and speed of result acquisition.[5] COVID-related precautions should be integrated into standard surgical time outs to ensure that all OR staff are properly protected.",

For example, the University of California at San Francisco founded the Urology Collaborative Online Video Didactics (COViD), a series of daily online lectures given by urologic educators across the country covering a variety of topics.[27] Participants have the opportunity to engage in discussion and ask questions, thereby receiving state-of-the-art education and gaining exposure to how urology is practiced outside their institutions.[27] These digital lectures also promote networking and resident camaraderie. Urology residents working on a flexible clinical schedule should maintain a daily log of their educational activities that can be monitored by their program directors. Ultimately, virtual platforms could lead to the implementation of a standardized national urology resident curriculum with interactive modules, where trainees have access to expert faculty in all areas of urology, regardless of their program size, location, or faculty composition.Table 2\n.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed many research practices. Some institutions have limited their laboratory staff, and many institutional review boards are not approving non-COVID-19 studies for the foreseeable future,[9] while others continue to maintain their portfolios of therapeutic clinical trials. These delays are likely to have consequences for both clinical and basic science research, but faculty mentorship and many current projects can continue.[9,28] We encourage urology residents to enhance their knowledge of research design and analysis by participating in free online courses offered by the AUA, American College of Surgeons, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) (Table 1).",
