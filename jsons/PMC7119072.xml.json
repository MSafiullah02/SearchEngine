Although autopsy rates in the U.S. have declined, the autopsy remains an important tool that allows the physician to gain additional information into the pathogenesis of disease, to identify clinically unsuspected disease processes, and to correlate premortem clinical diagnosis with postmortem findings (2). The goals of this article are to 1) discuss the role of the modern autopsy in ascertaining cause of death and advancing understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, 2) identify major clinical syndromes and the appropriate laboratory methods for detecting etiologic agent(s), 3) review the status of microbiologic cultures in the performance of the modern autopsy, 4) discuss the role and potential limitations of molecular pathology in today's autopsy, 5) review methods for protecting personnel in completion of the autopsy, and 6) discuss the role of the pathologist in community/national response to potential acts of bioterrorism.",

Certain infectious diseases progress so rapidly, so as to be initially considered a sudden death. However, even the most fulminant infectious diseases produce symptoms that precede death and are not instantaneous. Discussions with her roommates confirmed she had complained of respiratory symptoms and severe headache the morning of her death. At autopsy, there was gross evidence of purulent meningitis and culture yielded Neisseria meningitidis. This case highlights the changing epidemiology of meningitis, which includes an increase in cases in college students 3, 4.

These results may be supplemented with postmortem pulmonary cultures, and the results from both should be correlated with histopathologic findings. At times, cultures will not be available because death was sudden, infection was not suspected, infection was due to a fastidious pathogen, or prior antibiotic therapy affected culture results. In these instances, direct detection of the pathogen in tissue, using immunohistochemistry (IHC) or in situ hybridization techniques (ISH), should be attempted.

Although most cases of bacterial meningitis are due to hematogenous spread, search for a contiguous focus of disease (otitis media, sinusitis) is important in deciphering the pathogenesis of disease. Many infections have distinct seasonal and geographic predilections, which further narrows the differential diagnosis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), meninges, and CNS parenchyma may be obtained for bacterial, viral, and fungal cultures. Certain organisms such as rickettsia cannot be cultured but may show histological changes that can be evaluated further with IHC or molecular methods. Molecular techniques are extremely useful in deciphering CNS infections 23, 24, 25, particularly those due to viruses 26, 27.",

Although many infections may present with fever and rash, those most likely to lead abruptly to death include meningococcemia, rickettsial infections, and toxic shock syndrome. When evaluating the rash, it is important to note 1) characteristics of the lesions, 2) distribution of the rash, 3) presence of petechiae, and 4) timing and progression of the rash relative to fever and death. Meningococcemia characteristically produces petechial lesions on the trunk, extremities, and mucous membranes. Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a prototypical rickettsial infection, starts as a maculopapular rash that spreads centripetally and evolves eventually to petechiae. Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) produces a sunburn-type rash that desquamates usually after 1\u20132 weeks. Whereas blood cultures may yield the causative agent in meningococcemia, cultures would be negative in rickettsial infections. A skin biopsy, however, may allow the pathologist to identify the organisms using immunohistochemical stains of formal-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. In cases of suspected TSS, vaginal and wound cultures may be useful in elucidating the reservoir of bacteria. In a report on the autopsy of a 15-year-old girl with tampon-related TSS, Blair and colleagues demonstrated extensive superficial ulcerations and thrombophlebitis of the vagina, with bacteria on the mucosal surface only (29).",

When due to a single pathogen, the usual culprits are group A streptococcus, S. aureus, and anaerobic streptococci. Polymicrobial infections contain a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, sometimes numbering up to 15 different organisms. According to Gorbach, polymicrobial infections should be considered in four settings: 1) following surgical procedures, 2) infection proceeding from a decubitus ulcer or perianal abscess, 3) in intravenous drug users, and 4) spread from a Bartholin's abscess or minor vulvovaginal infection (44). The premortem diagnosis of a deep skin and soft tissue relies on a constellation of findings that include bullous lesions, gas in the soft tissues, and devitalization of fascial planes, all of which may be confused with postmortem degradation or decomposition. A high index of suspicion for the presence of a necrotizing soft tissue infection must be maintained. Appropriate cultures and full-thickness biopsies should be taken.",

When the gastrointestinal tract is the primary site of disease, those conditions most likely to produce death include bacillary dysentery, enteric fever, and amebic colitis/hepatic abscess (45). Shigella dysenteriae is the most virulent Shigella, producing classic dysentery that may be complicated by colonic ulceration, perforation, and peritonitis. At autopsy, there is extensive colonic ulceration with patchy to nearly continuous involvement. According to Kelly and Owen, most fatal cases show involvement of the entire colon and terminal ileum (46). Typhoid (enteric) fever is a severe systemic infection, the complications of which include pneumonia, hepatitis, myocarditis, meningitis, orchitis, and osteomyelitis. Perforation, hemorrhage, and sepsis are associated with high case fatality rates. Cultures of blood, stool, and urine are positive late in infection and remain the gold standard for antemortem diagnosis. As with other pathogens, molecular techniques are evolving to allow for a more rapid diagnosis and may be useful in the postmortem analysis 47, 48, 49.",

They offer the following recommendations for obtaining cultures at necropsy: 1) after making the initial incision, visually inspect the cavities for fluid collection and culture them before additional manipulation and culture organs that are clinically suspected of harboring infection; 2) dry the area to be cultured by searing with a hot steel spatula; 3) for tissue cultures, remove 1-cm3 portion of tissue with sterile instruments and place in a properly labeled, sterile Petri dish; 4) aspirate blood from the right atrium for aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures; 5) aspirate urine directly from the bladder and place in sterile tube; 6) obtain CSF from the lateral ventricle after the skull cap is removed or by cisternal tap through skin; 7) culture abscesses and granulomata from the center and periphery of the lesion; 8) use different sets of sterile instruments for each culture/site; and 9) divide the specimens aseptically for the various laboratories and deliver promptly.",

According to Chandler (59), one of the most important special stains is the silver impregnation for bacteria. Silver impregnation stains, such as the Warthin\u2013Starry, blacken all bacteria non-selectively including non-gram-reactive bacteria (e.g., Treponema pallidum, Borrelia burgdorferi, Leptospira spp. and Bartonella spp.) and small weakly gram-negative bacilli (e.g., Legionella spp. and Francisella tularensis). Although the black coating of the silver stain may distort the morphology of the bacteria, silver impregnation procedures are more sensitive than tissue gram stains especially when only a small number of bacteria are present. After bacteria have been detected, tissue gram stains can be utilized to distinguish between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The Brown and Brenn procedure is superior for demonstrating gram-positive bacteria and the Brown\u2013Hopps procedure is superior for demonstrating gram-negative bacteria and rickettsiae.",

In the case of hantavirus, IHC method using antiserum to hantaviral nucleocapsid antigen was critical in the early understanding of the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (64). In the case of West Nile virus, histologic examination of the central nervous system revealed necrosis in the gray matter with infiltrates of microglia and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These sections were then stained using IHC techniques that utilized an antibody to St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLE), a member of the Flavivirus family. Confirmatory tests using PCR were negative when SLE virus-specific primers were used. In addition, animals not usually associated with SLE outbreaks, such as crows and other birds, were reported to have increased fatalities. One explanation of these differing results was that the antibody used in IHC was known to cross-react with several other members of the Flavivirus serocomplex including SLE, Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. RT-PCR techniques were then performed utilizing several degenerate primer sets designed to detect a wide variety of flaviviruses. These tests concluded that West Nile virus was the causative agent (65).",
