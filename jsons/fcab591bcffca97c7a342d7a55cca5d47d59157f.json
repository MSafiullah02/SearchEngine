The adoption of this type of 22 attention could be particularly relevant in the prevention of new cases caused by 23 potential nosocomial infections 10 . Despite this, given the possibility of infection of other 24 individuals living in the same home, the referral of HaH should be done in all cases providing advice to the patient and relatives on specific self-isolation guidelines. 26 Furthermore, as there was observed during the current pandemic, the lack of healthcare 27 professionals caused by the necessary self-isolation after infection during their working 28 time, could be an important determinant of the collapse of the healthcare system. 29 Therefore, promoting the fast implementation of HaH services, might help preventing 30 the consequences of a likely upturn of SARS-CoV-2 infections, as well as the collapse 31 of healthcare systems.",
