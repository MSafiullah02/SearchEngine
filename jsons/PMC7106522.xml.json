HAdV is a non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the Mastadenovirus genus (Adenoviridae family). There are currently seven different HAdV species (A to G), including 103 HAdV types (HAdV types up to type number 51 were defined as serotypes and higher type numbers were defined as genotypes) (http://hadvwg.gmu.edu/). HAdV-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 14 and the re-emergent type HAdV-55 are known to cause ARTI [[4], [5], [6]]. Although HAdV is associated with mild to moderate disease in most cases, types 3 and 7 were increasingly reported [7,8] associated with severe, and even life-threatening infections and outbreaks. Therefore, investigating the epidemiological and clinical manifestations of different types of HAdV infections is helpful to the prevention and control of HAdV circulating.",

Among our studied cohort, 3.71% of paediatric patients with ARTI exhibited HAdV positive, which is lower than the finding (5.64%) in Beijing [9] during the same period. Such discrepant HAdV detection rates were easy to be explained by different regions. Previous studies from Beijing and Guangzhou [9,10] revealed that HAdV infections occurred throughout the year with the highest prevalence in the summer. However, a peak positive rate occurred during March-April in the present study, which is consistent with another study that has reported seasonal peak for HAdV infections in spring in Northern China [13]. We found that HAdV-positives cases detected predominantly (88.48%) in children under 3 years of age, with a peaking in children aged 1-2 years (P < 0.001), demonstrating that most children become infected by HAdV at an early age. A recent repeated cross sectional study [14] drew similar findings that the HAdV positive rate of children at the age of <3 years was 63.51% and the rate of HAdV infection peaking in children aged l-3 years in Northern China (P = 0.021).",

However, all the three HAdV-57-infected cases were co-infected with other respiratory viruses in their study. In this present study, HAdV-57 alone was identified in a previously healthy 10-months girl who diagnosed with bronchitis requiring hospitalization. The girl not only presented with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection, including fever (Maximum temperature = 37.5 \u00b0C), cough, runny nose, nasal congestion, sore throat and dyspnea, but also accompanied by vomiting.

Moreover, co-detection rates of different HAdV types varied, especially the co-detection rate of HAdV-C was significant higher than those of HAdV-B (P = 0.001). Nested PCR with a low limit of detection was used for typing of HAdV in the present study.

Similarly, through a comprehensive series of assays in vitro and in vivo as well as clinical correlates, a study in Chongqing [20] shown that HAdV-7 replicates more robustly than HAdV-3, and promotes an exacerbated cytokine response, causing a more severe airway inflammation. Our results revealed that patients with HAdV-7 positive experienced longer durations of fever than HAdV-2 or HAdV-3 positive patients, which was consistent with the results reported by Taiwan [15]. However, although patients with HAdV-7 positive had a higher rate of severe CAP and tended to require longer hospital stays in our study, no significant difference was found. Meanwhile, no patients with HAdV-7 positive needed PICU admission and mechanical ventilation in our study. These results may not support the conclusion from previous investigations [15,20] that HAdV-7 positive patients may have more severe clinical consequence.",
