Infants too young to be immunized and people who are immune compromised depend on herd immunity for protection. Accumulation of susceptible people in a community can result in periodic outbreaks when measles virus is circulating.30 Endemic transmission of measles has been interrupted in the United States since 2000,37 but travelers to areas where the virus still circulates account for 50 to 100 importations to the United States most years. Aggressive public health investigation of each suspected measles case is conducted to limit spread of the virus. Recently, several measles outbreaks in the United States have been associated with transmission among people who have not been vaccinated, intentionally, due to personal beliefs. In 2011, 222 measles cases occurred in the United States, the largest number of annual cases reported since 1996.38 The most important source of imported virus in 2011 was Europe, where large outbreaks affected multiple countries. A very large outbreak in France (where an estimated 20,000 cases occurred)39 was linked with importations to multiple countries in the Americas.38, 40 Public health response to each outbreak is expensive.24 Because measles is rarely seen in the United States, missed diagnosis can lead to sustained exposures particularly in health care settings (Fig. 14-3\n).41 Ensuring appropriate infection control practices and complete immunization histories or evidence of immunity among health care workers is especially important given the infectiousness of measles virus.",

Poor vaccine acceptance in selected communities, ranging from the Roma communities45 to anthroposophists in Switzerland has led to sizable outbreaks in Europe as well.46\n",

A retrospective analysis conducted there revealed vaccine efficacy was more than 95% within 3 years of receiving the last dose of acellular pertussis but decreased substantially by 5 years since vaccination.35, 58 This explained the predominance of 7- to 10-year olds in the 2010 resurgence. By 2012, high rates of disease occurred in Washington State and several other areas,57 with surprising increases also noted among 11- and 13-year olds. Questions have been raised about whether there is differential performance of Tdap booster vaccinations among teenagers who had received acellular vaccines as young children compared with the earlier experience of teenagers who received Tdap after earlier exposure to whole-cell vaccines. Although some have speculated that bacterial strain changes noted recently might account for disease resurgence,59 the dominant view is that acellular vaccines provide good short-term protection but provide immunity that wanes more rapidly than initially expected. Program priorities in this context are to target reduction of deaths, which mainly affect infants in the first few months of life. Hence, recent recommendations for women to be vaccinated during every pregnancy are a priority for disease control.60\n",

Acute respiratory infections remain the leading cause of mortality from infectious diseases in the United States and around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 4.2 million deaths resulted from lower respiratory tract infections in 2004, accounting for 7.1% of all deaths that year.67 Among persons who died of lower respiratory tract infections, 70% (2.9 million) were residents of low-income countries. Lower respiratory tract infections are the number one cause of death in the developing world. Even in high income countries, lower respiratory tract infections are the fourth leading cause of death, responsible for 4% of all-cause mortality. Mortality from lower respiratory tract infections has the greatest impact on young children. On a global basis, 42% of all deaths from lower respiratory tract infections (mostly due to pneumonia) occur in children younger than 5 years of age.67 Significant influenza- and pneumonia-associated mortality also occurs in persons older than 65 years of age and in individuals with chronic underlying pulmonary disease. In the United States, influenza and pneumonia are the leading cause of infectious disease\u2013related mortality and the eighth most frequent cause of death.68\n",

In contrast, hMPV is rarely (<1%) identified in children or adults who are not ill and when found is usually present in much lower titers than when detected during illness.69, 73, 75 A recent multiyear, multicenter prospective study suggests that hMPV produces 20,000 hospitalizations, 263,000 emergency department visits, and 1 million outpatient visits annually among children younger than 5 years of age in the United States.75 Because disease is also found in older children and in adults, these numbers represent an unknown proportion of the overall burden of illness due to hMPV.

The following winter, four symptomatic and one asymptomatic community-acquired SARS cases occurred in Guangzhou. There was also a series of laboratory acquired infections in Taiwan, Singapore, and mainland China over the same time period.88 No cases of SARS have been recognized anywhere in the world since 2004.",

The earliest recognized cases were retrospectively identified in 2 persons in Jordan who were part of an 11-person hospital cluster of respiratory illnesses in April 2012.99 Of the 81 confirmed cases, the median age is 55 years (range, 2 to 94 years) and 45 (56%) have died; 64% of the cases for whom gender is known occurred in males. Illness has been characterized by severe respiratory distress and pneumonia often requiring mechanical ventilation, and some cases have been accompanied by renal insufficiency.99 A three-person cluster in Great Britain where the index case was exposed in the Middle East and disease subsequently occurred in two close contacts in Great Britain with no history of travel, as well as an instance of nosocomial transmission in France where the index case was exposed in the Middle East, provide evidence the virus can be spread person to person.99 In addition to the 2012 Jordanian hospital cluster, another outbreak in April 2013 involving 22 persons, including health care workers, and 9 deaths in an eastern Saudi Arabian hospital suggests nosocomial transmission.100 Genetic analyses of this novel coronavirus show it is the first lineage C betacoronavirus infecting humans and has a close relationship to betacoronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5 found in bats, including insectivorous bat species present in the Middle East.101, 102, 103 A virus with 100% sequence homology to the MERS-CoV isolated from the 2012 Saudi Arabian index case was found in an Egyptian tomb bat (Taphozous perforatus) trapped in the vicinity of that patient's home.104 These findings suggest bats play an important role in the ecology of MERS-CoV and could be the reservoir for this new coronavirus. The virus targets a unique receptor and appears capable of infecting multiple mammalian cell lines, suggesting the potential for a zoonotic intermediary, and serologic evidence of infection with MERS-CoV has been reported in mammalian species.105, 106, 107\n",

All subsequent human H5N1 illnesses, as well as the animal outbreaks that have led to the natural death and culling of more than 250 million poultry and wild birds, have been caused by descendants of the 1996 goose Guangdong lineage.119, 120 This virus has evolved into two major clades (1 and 2) and numerous additional clades and subtypes that have spread over three continents during sequential waves believed to originate in southern China.119, 121\n",

Between 2009 and 2012, human disease has only been found in six countries (Indonesia, Egypt, Vietnam, China, Cambodia, and Bangladesh).136 Among countries with at least 20 reported cases, mortality has been highest in Cambodia (90%) and Indonesia (83%) and lowest in Egypt (36%). Reasons for variations in mortality are unclear, but data indicate that persons with H5N1 infections in Egypt are younger than those in other locations and overall mortality appears to be age dependent. In an analysis of a large dataset of H5N1 cases, mortality was reported to be six times higher in 10- to 29-year-olds than in children younger than 10 years old and almost five times higher in adults 30 years of age and older than in children younger than 10 years old.141, 142 Early hospitalization has also been reported to reduce mortality,141 and observational studies have suggested that early administration of oseltamivir also reduces mortality.64, 143, 144 Differences in a variety of laboratory and clinical parameters have also been described between fatal and nonfatal cases.64, 144, 145 It is unclear if variation in mortality rates can be attributed to specific clades or subtypes of H5N1.",

Most human illness has exhibited clinical and radiographic evidence of pneumonia, which is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in influenza.64, 111 Human-to-human transmissibility is a key requirement for pandemic influenza viruses, and the ability of circulating H5N1 viruses to acquire this attribute has been of keen interest to the public health community. Two recent experiments, one through in vitro genetic reassortment and the other through site-directed mutagenesis and serial passage in ferrets, provided evidence that H5N1 can mutate in ways that facilitate transmission between ferrets, the usual surrogate for human influenza.150, 151 These \u201cgain-of-function\u201d experiments produced considerable debate and international alarm, resulting in delayed publication of the studies and prompting a temporary moratorium on such research until additional safeguards were in place to minimize the potential for inadvertent laboratory release or intentional misuse.152, 153 They also highlighted the need to continue preparedness efforts to develop countermeasures against H5N1 and other pandemic threats in case such mutations occur in nature. Neuraminidase inhibitors could be used prophylactically and therapeutically in the event of widespread H5N1 disease. In addition, a number of licensed pre-pandemic H5N1 vaccines have been produced by different approaches; in the United States, H5N1 vaccine is being stockpiled by the federal government as a contingency measure.154, 155\n",

Analysis of the virus finds it to be a quadruple reassortant with all genetic segments originating in Eurasian lineage avian viruses (H7N3, H9N2, H9N7) with acquired mutations that enhance adaptation to humans.18, 116, 156 The virus is of low pathogenicity to poultry and other bird species, meaning it produces minimal overt illness in bird hosts.18 This makes it difficult to track and complicates application of control measures such as culling. Testing of avian species and environmental samples in affected areas of China found H7N9 viruses similar to those causing human illness in chickens, ducks, and pigeons, although at a very low prevalence (0.07% of 68,060 samples) given the rapid increase in recognized human cases.157 By the summer of 2013, a total of 135 confirmed human illnesses had been detected with a 33% case-fatality rate. The number of H7N9 cases recognized after only 5 months of monitoring is higher than the greatest number of H5N1 cases seen in any year since it emerged in 1997. These H7N9 cases were found in nine contiguous eastern China provinces in addition to Beijing and Shanghai, although 79% of cases were in Shanghai and adjacent Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.157 This demonstrates a wide zone of circulation in urban and rural locations either through natural spread or commercial transport and movement of poultry and other birds. An additional case was identified in Taiwan in an individual who had returned from an affected area of mainland China 3 days before illness onset.158 As of the summer of 2013, all identified cases appeared to be sporadic except for three family clusters that could represent possible limited person-to-person spread.159 However, monitoring of almost 1700 health care workers, family members, and close social contacts of ill individuals did not find any culture-confirmed illness to suggest that person-to-person transmission of the virus had occurred.159\n",

Both the novelty of the virus and the lack of swine contact in these children raised immediate concern that the virus was transmitted from person to person and therefore posed a pandemic threat.16 Furthermore, only weeks earlier, Mexican health authorities had reported to the Pan American Health Organization an outbreak of severe respiratory illness associated with more than 800 hospitalizations and 100 deaths, mostly in children and young adults.164 The same pH1N1 virus was subsequently identified in more than 40% of samples tested from Mexican patients that were part of this outbreak.164 Epidemiologic investigations in Mexico suggested that illnesses with this virus occurred as early as February 2009 in an area of Veracruz State with nearby swine farms.165 Within 3 weeks of its detection in the United States, more than 600 additional illnesses with pH1N1, including clusters, had been recognized in 41 states.16 The virus was also quickly detected on other continents,166 and by June 11, 2009, the WHO declared that an influenza pandemic due to pH1N1 was underway.167\n",

Children and young adults were disproportionately impacted by the pH1N1 pandemic, with 33% of all cases occurring in those younger than 18 years of age. In contrast, only 10% of all cases occurred in persons in the 65 and older age group. The estimated overall attack rate in children was 26%, and in persons older than 18 years it was 18.5%.178 In contrast to mortality patterns with seasonal influenza, where 90% of all deaths occur in persons older than age 65 years, 87% of all influenza-related deaths in the United States during the pandemic were in persons younger than age 65 years and the median age of death was 37 years.178, 179 However, the case-fatality rate was estimated to be more than four times higher in persons older than 65 years of age than in children younger than 18 years of age.178 Globally, the estimated number of respiratory and cardiovascular deaths associated with pH1N1 was 284,500 (range, 151,700 to 575,500), with 80% of these deaths in persons younger than 65 years of age.180\n",

In the United States, morbidly obese persons with no other chronic medical conditions had a statistically significant odds of hospitalization of 4.9 and an odds of death if hospitalized of 7.6 compared with nonobese persons.187 In a global pooled data analysis, the relative risk of death among the morbidly obese was 36.3.186 The increased risk for severe outcomes in both pregnant women and obese persons is likely multifactorial but could include relative immune suppression or impaired pulmonary function. Another high-risk group for severe illness was children with neurologic disease. In the United States, 43% of fatalities in those younger than 18 years of age had neurologic disease; 94% of these children had neurodevelopmental disorders such as cerebral palsy and intellectual impairment.188\n",

Once pH1N1 was recognized to pose a pandemic threat, efforts were immediately initiated to develop monovalent vaccines. Trials in the United States showed that candidate vaccines produced using standard methods were immunogenic and safe, and large-scale production was initiated under government purchase and distribution.189 Priority groups for vaccination representing 159 million persons were identified by the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices and the CDC, and a more limited priority group of 62 million persons was identified for the anticipated initial limited vaccine supply (Table 14-7\n). Ultimately, the first vaccine supplies did not become available until the beginning of October 2009, only weeks before the second wave of illness peaked. This was too late to have a substantial short-term impact, and allocation and distribution of limited supplies were challenging.189, 190 Pandemic vaccine was shown to have a safety profile similar to seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine, and studies generally showed 70% to 90% effectiveness against laboratory-confirmed disease.189, 191 Through the end of 2009, approximately 81 million doses of vaccine were shipped and 61 million doses were administered, with 74% given to priority targeted groups.192 Neuraminidase inhibitors were widely employed for treatment, with an estimated 8.2 million prescriptions filled during the pandemic.193 Investigational intravenous peramivir and zanamivir were also successfully used in almost 1500 persons in the United States.194, 195 A number of observational studies demonstrated that antiviral drugs administered early in the course of illness reduced adverse outcomes.196\n",

Since the original identification of bocavirus DNA in respiratory specimens, three additional bocaviruses have been found in stool specimens; these agents are now referred to as HBoV1 to HBoV4. HBoV2 to HBoV4 are believed to be associated with gastrointestinal illness, whereas HBoV1 causes predominantly respiratory disease.205\n",

However, numerous studies suggest HBoV1 can be found in 2% to 19% of patients with acute respiratory tract infections, and, as often as 83% of the time, is present with other coinfecting respiratory pathogens.205, 206 This latter finding calls into question whether HBoV1 is a pathogen, especially because HBoV1 has been shown to persist in respiratory specimens for months after acute infection, meaning it can be detected in asymptomatic individuals.205, 206 However, in most studies HBoV1 has been found more commonly in children with acute respiratory disease than asymptomatic children; copy numbers of the virus are higher in monoinfections than coinfections and are usually low in asymptomatic children. Serology also suggests HBoV1 is a pathogen.205, 206, 207 Children aged 6 to 24 months are most commonly infected; serologic studies show that almost all children have evidence of previous HBoV1 infection by 6 years of age.205, 207 Illness is most common in winter. Infection can produce either upper or lower respiratory tract infection and in children is often accompanied by wheezing; pneumonia and bronchiolitis can also be seen.205, 206, 208 Of note, DNA has been detected in serum and urine of children with acute infections, suggesting systemic infections can occur.205\n",

For example, nontyphoidal Salmonella species and Campylobacter jejuni are transmitted principally through food, Shigella species are transmitted primarily from person to person, and Cryptosporidium parvum is principally waterborne. Determination of the patterns of distribution of enteric pathogens in a geographic area may suggest the relative importance of different modes of transmission in that locale.",

Cholera had not been recognized in South America during the 20th century, but in January 1991 cases were identified in coastal areas of Peru.223 Within weeks, thousands of cases were occurring and cholera quickly became the most commonly diagnosed cause of diarrheal illness in many parts of Peru.224, 225 During the next 3 years, the disease spread throughout mainland South and Central America, significantly altering the distribution patterns of etiologic agents of diarrheal disease. The incidence of the disease in Latin America has subsequently declined dramatically.",

The FQR2 lineage originated in 2003 in North America but subsequently spread more widely, causing hospital outbreaks in the United Kingdom, continental Europe, and Australia.289 Of the HAIs, 75% of persons had onset of illness outside acute care hospitals (in the community or in nursing homes).289, 290 These strains can cause severe disease, particularly in elderly patients. Since 2005, another C. difficile strain (PCR ribotype O78) has emerged in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom.291 This strain also appears to be hypervirulent and is more likely to affect younger persons and to be associated with community-onset disease.291 Isolates of C. difficile also have been obtained from retail ground meat samples,292 prompting the need for evaluation of the potential role of foodborne transmission in community-associated cases. Recent experiences with fecal microbiota transplantation have suggested an important role for this approach in the management of patients with severe C. difficile infections.293, 294\n",

Because recent antimicrobial exposure has been identified as a risk factor for acquisition of enteric infections in animal models332 and in humans,333, 334 continued emphasis on judicious antimicrobial use is critical. Finally, because human contact with animals and their environments remains an important mode of acquisition of important enteric pathogens, especially Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Cryptosporidium,\n335, 336, 337, 338, 339 increased interdisciplinary collaborative efforts at the human, animal, environmental interface as promoted by the \u201cOne Health\u201d model are a priority (see \u201cVector-borne and Zoonotic Diseases\u201d).",

The frequency of dengue and its more severe complications\u2014dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome\u2014has been increasing dramatically since 1980.354 It is generally estimated that 50 to 100 million infections occur annually, but recent data suggest that approximately 390 million dengue infections occurred worldwide in 2010, including 96 million symptomatic illnesses.355 Dengue is caused by any of four antigenically distinct virus serotypes (DEN-1, -2, -3, -4) of the genus Flavivirus. Infection with one of these serotypes is not cross protective. Infection with dengue viruses produces a spectrum of clinical illness that ranges from a nonspecific viral syndrome to severe and fatal hemorrhagic disease.356 DHF is a life-threatening condition characterized by capillary permeability that may lead to hypovolemic shock and death. Important risk factors for DHF include the strain and serotype of the infecting virus, as well as the age, immune status, and genetic predisposition of the patient. In endemic areas, most deaths from dengue infection occur in children younger than 15 years of age.356 Economic impact analyses in both the Americas and Asia indicate that the burden of dengue-related illness in children is substantial, especially when nonhospitalized patients are considered.357, 358\n",

In an effort to prevent urban yellow fever, which is also transmitted by A. aegypti, the Pan American Health Organization established a program in the 1950s and 1960s to eradicate the species from most of Central and South America.353 As a result, epidemic dengue occurred only sporadically in some Caribbean islands during this period. The success of the program, however, led to its gradual discontinuation beginning in 1970. Since that time, A. aegypti has reestablished itself firmly in the region, now exceeding the extent of distribution that was seen before the eradication program began (Fig. 14-9\n). Epidemics of dengue fever now routinely occur in Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, and other locations in Latin America and the Caribbean.359 Puerto Rico, which has experienced epidemic dengue activity periodically since 1963, suffered the largest dengue outbreak in its history in 2010, affecting more than 21,000 people.360 In 2009 and 2010, Florida reported the first cases of dengue acquired in the continental United States outside the Texas-Mexico border since 1945.361 Multiple outbreaks in Africa were identified in 2013.362 A number of lines of evidence suggest that dengue is endemic in Africa on a par with the Americas but is not well recognized.355, 363\n",

Indeed, chikungunya is frequently misdiagnosed as dengue, and outbreaks of the two diseases can occur simultaneously.367 Chikungunya is, however, caused by a member of the family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus. Chikungunya virus infection is noteworthy in that joint pain is a prominent feature of the disease, a condition that may persist for months. Joints most commonly involved include ankle, knee, wrist, and small joints of the hands. Chikungunya was first detected in Tanzania in 1953 and spread to other parts of Africa and parts of Asia.368, 369\n",

Hemorrhagic fever outbreaks typically result from a single or small number of spillover events from the virus reservoir with subsequent chains of human-to-human transmission in community (sometimes associated with funerals) and hospital settings.435 Transmission in health care settings can be prevented by adherence to basic infection control practices and proper disposal of potentially infectious items.436 The four distinct filovirus outbreaks that occurred in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2012 were quickly identified and brought under control. That these outbreaks were kept relatively small is attributable in part to the availability of in-country filovirus diagnostics at the viral hemorrhagic fever reference laboratory located at the Uganda Viral Research Institute (UVRI) in Entebbe. This laboratory is a component of a viral hemorrhagic fever surveillance program established in 2010 by the UVRI and the Uganda Ministry of Health, in collaboration with the CDC.345, 431\n",

Each year, antibiotic-resistant infections cost the U.S. health care system more than $20 billion and are responsible for more than 8 million additional hospital days.454, 455 Moreover, these infections often require the use of less effective, more expensive, and often more toxic drugs. Areas of particular concern include continued threats from multi- and pan-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, health care\u2013 and community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections with continued evolution and global spread of highly virulent clones, along with newer challenges including increases in highly resistant gram-negative bacteria, particularly carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and increasing resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in persons infected with Neisseria gonorrhoeae.\n456 Also of concern are increases in severe, life-threatening C. difficile infections, usually associated with recent antibiotic use and often occurring among hospitalized patients (see \u201cDiarrheal Disease\u201d).

After introduction of each new class of antibiotics has come global spread of resistant strains, with factors such as global travel and trade accelerating this spread (Fig. 14-10\n). As early as the 1930s, sulfonamide-resistant strains of Streptococcus pyogenes were noted in military hospitals, and numerous bacterial strains, including S. aureus, were found to be resistant to penicillin shortly after its introduction and use in the 1940s.460, 461 In 1961, just 2 years after the introduction of methicillin, MRSA strains emerged in British hospitals,462, 463 and strains exhibiting intermediate or high level resistance to vancomycin have been identified since 1996.464, 465, 466, 467\n",
