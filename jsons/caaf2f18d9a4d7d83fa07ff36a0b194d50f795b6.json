The Guangdong health authority officially informed about this outbreak on 11 February 2003. The first atypical pneumonia cases outside China were reported to WHO on 3 March from Hanoi, Vietnam (Whaley & Mansoor 2006) , followed by similar reports from Hong Kong on 11 March (Tomlinson & Cockram 2003) and from Canada, Singapore and Taiwan on 14 March (Merianos et al. 2005) . In Beijing, the outbreak began around 5 March (2nd March according to WHO), with the importation of several cases and subsequent spread in health care facilities (Pang et al. 2003) . By 11 July, 8437 cases and 813 deaths were reported from 32 countries (WHO 2003e) ; these figures were later corrected to ultimately 8096 SARS cases and 774 deaths in 29 countries and areas between November 2002 and July 2003 (WHO 2003b) . More than 95% of cases occurred in 12 countries of the Western Pacific Region with mainland China being the worst affected (WHO 2003c) . A comprehensive analysis of the Chinese SARS database led to some duplicate cases being removed and other new cases being added so that mainland China ultimately counted a total of 5327 probable SARS cases (Feng et al. 2009 ). Beijing had the largest outbreak, harbouring nearly 50% of China's SARS cases (Pang et al. 2003) .",

For a new rapidly spreading disease that did not respond to the classic antiviral therapies and for which no vaccines were available, traditional public health interventions, such as early case detection, case isolation, tracing and quarantine of contacts, strict infection control, decreasing social interaction and keeping the public informed were the only options available (Bell and WHO Working Group on Prevention of International and Community Transmission of SARS 2004). In less than 4 months on 5 July 2003, WHO announced the interruption of human-to-human SARS transmission (Merianos et al. 2005) .",

For this review, a comparative approach was chosen owing to China's unique situation, as it was the first and most severely affected country where SARS emerged, and it showed an initial reluctance to deal openly with the situation. This review summarises and compares the major control measures implemented in mainland China, to those in Singapore, Vietnam, Hong Kong (SAR), Taiwan (RoC) and Canada and thereby aims to highlight distinctive features of the Chinese approach. The lessons could help policy makers to modify outbreak management strategies for a better preparedness and earlier response in future.",

This action was the legal authority for health departments to institute the rules of the 'Prevention and Treatment Law', for example, quarantine, isolation, etc., to control spread (Rothstein et al. 2003) . Hereafter, health authorities from all provinces were required to daily collect and report all probable SARS cases and deaths using a standardised case report form (Pang et al. 2003) .

A report giving a first case description for the disease named 'atypical pneumonia' or feidian in Chinese with symptoms and treatment options was developed and distributed by the end of January 2003 in Guangdong hospitals (Abraham 2004 ). On 15 March, WHO named the new disease SARS and formulated a case definition based on clinical signs and symptoms and a history of contact or travel to a SARS affected area. This case definition, which closely resembled the Guangdong definition, was used by most countries but often in a modified version. Singapore, for example, expanded on the WHO's case definition and adopted a 'wide-net' surveillance policy to detect cases with atypical presentations early (Tan 2006) . In China, initially having close contact with a SARS case or having infected another person was essential for the diagnosis, later a history of stay or travel to an area with SARS transmission (e.g. Beijing) or contact with a health care facility was sufficient (Wu et al. 2004) . In Canada's case definition Toronto was not included in the list of affected areas, only contact to a health care setting (Health Canada 2003a).",

Additional measures to enhance early detection of cases in the community and to reassure the public included public temperature screening, for example, before entering schools, public buildings, offices, hospitals, etc. In Taiwan, people were asked to wear masks in closed public places (Maloney et al. 2006) .",

In addition, lower-level government officials feared reprimand or being bypassed for promotion, on account of inefficiency and hence also hampered or distorted the upward flow of information. An additional communication gap arose because of the large number of cases, which were received by the Beijing military hospitals and initially not reported to the state medical system (Huang 2004) .

Therefore, anyone who reports about such an occurrence without prior permission is liable to persecution, which partially explains why Guangdong could not share their information with other provincial health authorities (Huang 2004) . The MOH's decision to finally list SARS as an infectious disease on 8 April opened the way for implementing the provisions provided in the 'Law on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases' at all levels and hence marked the turnaround in China's SARS control policy. This included instituting measures such as accurate case reporting, imposing sanctions for non-reporting, institution of quarantine and isolation, initiating open communication at all levels, etc. (Rothstein et al. 2003 ). Establishing a system where the central and local authorities are well connected and each level has its predefined responsibilities could avert such delays. The Chinese public health emergency regulations now require the immediate setting up of an emergency task force after a health crisis is identified, in addition cases can be reported directly to China CDC and MOH by the local level through internet based reporting (Huang 2004) .",

Such a large scale quarantine might have been effective for China because of its unique situation as many of the initial SARS cases in Guangdong were food handlers or sold wild animals along with the fact that more than 65% of cases in Beijing did not have a contact history during the later phase of the epidemic (Wu et al. 2004 ) but generally its effectiveness for containing SARS was questioned as only a very small percentage of quarantined individuals developed SARS (Bell and WHO working group on prevention of international and community transmission of SARS 2004; Day et al. 2006) . In Hong Kong 2.7% (Tsang 2005) and in Taiwan only 0.22% (Bell and WHO working group on prevention of international and community transmission of SARS 2004) of quarantined individuals developed SARS.

As the SARS epidemic was also a politically charged issue, with a lot of international pressure, some of the reviewed information might depict the ideal situation as laid down in the guidelines and to a lesser extent the real situation. In addition, it might have resulted in a publication bias with over projection of effective control measures while leaving out negative aspects. Because of language constraints articles and books published in Chinese, Malaysian, Vietnamese and French languages could not be reviewed, i.e. only literature published or translated in English language was used, which might have limited the diversity of opinion and information to some extent. Yet, all efforts were made to find multiple literature sources and to view the literature in a scientific and objective manner.",

It demanded rapid and decisive action to be taken, yet the comparison shows how difficult this was for an unknown new disease. The comparison shows that the reviewed countries reacted rapidly after WHO's global alert and dealt openly with the situation, Guangdong also reacted rapidly but this pace was not continued by China for sometime which facilitated national and international spread. Yet, criticising retrospectively is always easy. The dilemma of trying to maintain economic and social stability while at the same time protecting public health would challenge any nation. The SARS outbreak which fortunately was only moderately transmissible, indicates how dire the consequences of a highly infectious disease outbreak could be. The significance of timely information was perhaps the main lesson that the SARS epidemic taught. The key is to be prepared for such events as far as possible by establishing sensitive surveillance systems, clear reporting pathways, open communication structures, co-operation among nations and well planned and tested pandemic plans.",
