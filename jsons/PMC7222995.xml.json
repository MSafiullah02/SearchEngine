            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is a lipid-enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae. The viral envelope contains three transmembrane proteins (NA [neuraminidase], HA [hemagglutinin] and M2 [proton channel]) on the viral surface and one protein (M1 [matrix protein]) below the membrane. The viral core contains the nucleoprotein (NP), viral RNA, and three polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2, and PA) [1]. IAV is classified into subtypes based on two major antigens: the surface spike glycoproteins NA and HA [2]. All IAV subtypes are known to cause infections in birds, which are their natural reservoir [3]. Humans are infected principally by the IAV subtypes H1N1, H2N2, H3N2, H7N9, and H5N1 [4]. Influenza pandemics have become serious socioeconomic and public-health problems worldwide. Moreover, seasonal flu causes approximately 250,000 to 500,000 deaths per year [5, 6]. IAV epidemics and pandemics are attributed to mutations in the viral RNA genome. Mutations involving surface proteins (NA and HA) result in structural protein changes that cause a loss of antibody recognition against the virus. This is one reason why new flu vaccines need to be designed for each seasonal influenza or pandemic influenza strain. The development of vaccines is the major method used to prevent IAV infection and represents one of the most important contributions by the immunology field to public health [7]. An important strategy is to identify conserved epitopes that may be used to design new vaccines that are capable of conferring broad protection.",

            "text": "Currently, the primary goal is to develop vaccines that protect by eliciting antibody responses against multiple subtypes and strains of influenza viruses [8\u201310]. These broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) generally target conserved and functional regions or epitopes on the major surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (head and stem), neuraminidase, and M2e [10\u201312]. The hemagglutinin (HA) is the main surface glycoprotein of influenza virus, which mediates the adsorption and penetration of the virus into host cells [13]. Each molecule of HA comprises a membrane distal globular head composed of HA1, which contains the receptor-binding site (RBS), and a stem region, which encompasses the fusion machinery [14]. Most bnAbs are directed against the HA protein. The receptor-binding site is a functionally conserved region on the HA1 globular head domain that is a target for bnAbs that inhibit viral entry by preventing HA binding to its host receptor [15, 16]. Since the stem region contains the most conserved epitopes for antibody recognition, antibodies produce against this region have a higher neutralization breadth than RBS-targeted bnAbs. These stem-binding bnAbs inhibit virus replication by blocking attachment and preventing conformational changes that are essential for membrane fusion [15\u201317]. NA is the second most abundant glycoprotein on the surface of influenza A and B viruses, and conserved domains or epitopes in NA induce bnAbs that protect against viruses of a single subtype [17]. Thus, NA epitopes may use in universal influenza vaccines [12, 17\u201320]. Although NA-specific antibodies can control infection by several mechanisms, the main mechanism is the inhibition of enzyme activity [12, 18, 21].",

These procedures are performed at the molecular level [22] using information from the Protein Data Bank. This strategy offers many advantages, such as the production of short immunogenic peptides without the risk of infection and safe handling of biological samples under room-temperature conditions. Additionally, peptides can be synthesized in vitro to decrease production costs and can be handled without strict conditions due to their stability [23]. Peptide vaccines are classified according to the immunological cell type involved in the immune response (i.e., B-cell or T-cell epitopes) and are used to induce specific immune responses. T cells recognize peptides coupled to MHC from antigen-presenting cells, and the MHC is then coupled to the T-cell receptor (TCR). Following the formation of the peptide-MHC-TCR complex, T cells receive several biological signals that are capable of activating the immune system to act against microorganisms or cancer cells [24]. In addition, activation of B cells by epitopes can increase the protection spectrum of vaccines, making them more protective than those with limited immune system activation capacity [25].",

P1 is located in the middle of HA, whereas P2-P4 and P6 are located in globular heads of HA. P5 is located in in globular head of NA (Fig. 1S). We determined the degree of exposure of the regions by visual inspection, using the VMD program [35]. Once the most promising epitopes were identified, we added linkers of different length and structure (6-9 glycine residues) to control the distance between two selected epitopes and to maintain multi-epitope properties, discarding hybrids in which the added glycines or the neighboring peptides were predicted to be immunogenic. Additionally, epitopes previously identified by our research group were selected as candidates for the construction of hybrid peptides to evaluate their capacity to increase immunological responses [19, 36].",

P1 was conserved to different degrees with respect to subtypes H1N1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934), H7N9 and H5N1 (Table 3). The most similarity was observed with H1N1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) and the lowest with H3N2 (see Fig. 1A), suggesting that P1 could induce immunogenic responses against H1N1, H2N2, H3N2, H7N9 and H5N1 as a multi-vaccine. P2 and P4 were most similar to the corresponding sequences of pandemic H1N1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934), see Table 3), suggesting that they were potential candidates for specific vaccines and immunodiagnostics, whereas P3 was most similar to the corresponding sequence of H1N1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) and had a low degree of similarity to H3N2 sequences. However, multiple alignment of NA sequences showed that P5 was more similar to the corresponding sequences of the H1N1 (A/Brisbane/59/2007 [H1N1]) and H5N1 subtypes than to those of other influenza virus subtypes (see Table 3). Furthermore, P1, P3 and P5 could work as a multi-vaccine epitope to provide broad protection against unspecified influenza A virus infections. One additional parameter that the epitopes needed to achieve for good recognition by MHC and TCR was low structural mobility [50]. This was investigated using MD simulations [50] measuring structural motions dependent on structural flexibility of hybrid peptides with long sequences (Fig. 2). It is known that lower flexibility of peptides is associated with a better immune response [36]. As shown in Fig. 2, P9 yielded larger RMSD values in MD simulations than compared to P11 and P14 (approximately 125-200 ns and higher fluctuation close to 225 ns) (Fig. 2A). From 275 ns to 500 ns, P11 showed less motion with minimal oscillations compared to P9 and P14, suggesting that it might be more immunogenic. Based on RMSF values, P9 exhibited more mobility than P11 and P14. Additionally, P9 had higher Rg values (approximately 175 ns) compared to P11 and P14. These results agree with some of the biological results described in the following paragraphs.",

The origin of these cross-reactive antibodies may be cross-reactive T and B cells specific for conserved epitopes in the hybrid peptides P11 and P14. Various studies have demonstrated that cross-protection against influenza virus strains may be due to cross-reactive T cells [67\u201369]. A previous in silico analysis provided a list of potential cross-reactive T-cell epitopes, including the sequences CPKYVKSTK and HAGAKSFYKNL, which were present in P1, P11 and P14 [70].

In this study, antibodies from rabbits immunized with P11 and P14 recognized viral particles of strain (A Puerto Rico/916/34) immobilized with ConA (Fig. 7), and they also inhibited hemagglutination with titers higher than 40 (Fig. 7), which decreases the risk of infection to 50% [72]. The above coincides with the neutralizing capacity of antibodies induced in mice immunized with peptides 11 and 14 (reciprocal of PRNT50 titer of 380 and 1600, respectively; Table 7).

Only P1 alone produced a response in vivo. The observed responses to P11 and P14 could have been due to coupling to KLH. Additionally, P11 contained P1 and P14 contained a recently reported peptide [19]. However, the responses against H7N9 were apparently not due to the presence of linear epitopes, suggesting that the peptides were capable of adopting 3D structures that formed a conformational epitope [62]. Rabbit antibodies to P11 and P14 recognized HA proteins from both group 1 (H1, H2, and H5) and group 2 (H3 and H7) influenza A viruses belonging to three different clades: the H1 clade (H1, H2, and H5), the H3 clade (H3), and the H7 clade (H7). Additionally, the antibodies also recognized purified neuraminidase from the viral stock and viral particles immobilized in the trapping ELISA, and they were able to inhibit hemagglutination and neutralize the virus.",

The use of bioinformatics tools enabled the identification of potential epitopes for vaccine purposes.
