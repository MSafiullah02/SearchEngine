Pulse-chase experiments of cells infected with human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV-2) showed decreased proteasomal degradation of Cavin3. Overexpression of hPIV-2 V protein alone was sufficient to inhibit Cavin3 degradation. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that V protein bound to Cavin3. Trp residues within C-terminal region of V protein, as well as the N-terminal region of Cavin3, are important for V-Cavin3 interaction. Cavin3 knockdown suppressed hPIV-2 growth without affecting its entry, replication, transcription, or translation. Higher amounts of Cavin3 were observed in V protein-overexpressing cells than in control cells in lipid raft microdomains. Our data collectively suggest that hPIV-2 V protein binds to and stabilizes Cavin3, which in turn facilitates assembly and budding of hPIV-2 in lipid raft microdomains.",

            "text": "Human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV-2) is an enveloped, non-segmented, negative-strand RNA virus of the Orthorubulavirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae 1 . Its genome is composed of six tandem genes encoding the nucleocapsid (NP), phospho-(P), V, matrix (M), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), fusion (F), and large (L) proteins (Lamb and Parks, 2013) . The unedited faithful copy of the P gene encodes the V open reading frame (ORF), while the edited insertion of two G nucleotides shifts the mRNA to the P ORF at the editing site (Ohgimoto et al., 1990) . Thus, N-terminal amino acid sequences of P and V proteins are in common. Although V protein is not essential for hPIV-2 replication, the growth of V-deficient hPIV-2 is remarkably decreased relative to wt hPIV-2 (Nishio et al., 2005; Ohta et al., 2016b) (Table 1) . V protein has been found to interact with several host proteins, such as STATs (Nishio et al., 2005) , AIP1/Alix (Nishio et al., 2007) , TRAF6 (Kitagawa et al., 2013) , tetherin (Ohta et al., 2016b) , Graf1 (Ohta et al., 2016a) , caspase1 (Ohta et al., 2018a) , inactive RhoA (Ohta et al., 2018c) , and profilin2 (Ohta et al., 2019) . Most of these V partners interact with the C-terminal region of V protein containing three Trp and seven Cys residues that form a bowl-shaped depression (Figure 1 ) (Li et al., 2006) . The one exception is Graf1 whose interaction site is the N-terminal V/P common region (Ohta et al., 2016a) . Ohta et al. (2018c) FIGURE 1 | Amino acid sequences of the V-specific region of hPIV-2 V proteins. Trp and Cys residues are marked with filled circles and filled squares, respectively. Trp-and Cys-mutated V proteins used in this study are also shown.",

            "text": "Caveolae are non-clathrin-coated invaginations of the plasma membrane (Anderson, 1998) . They regulate lipid homeostasis, membrane tension, trafficking, and endocytosis (Parton and del Pozo, 2013; Shvets et al., 2014) . Caveolae are specialized lipid raft microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids (Parton and Simons, 2007) . Caveolin and cavin proteins are critical components of caveolae (Hansen and Nichols, 2010) . Caveolins are caveolae coat membrane proteins with molecular weights of 20-24 kDa (Hansen and Nichols, 2010) . Among three caveolin family members (Caveolin1-3), Caveolin1 and Caveolin3 are essential for caveolae formation in non-muscle cells and muscle cells, respectively (Drab et al., 2001; Galbiati et al., 2001) , while Caveolin2 is dispensable (Razani et al., 2002) . Cavin proteins interact with Caveolin1 to regulate caveolae formation and function (Hill et al., 2008) . Cavin proteins are key cytoplasmic components of caveolae with molecular weights of 31-47 kDa (Hansen and Nichols, 2010) . All cavin proteins (Cavin1-4) contain leucine zippers (LZs), PEST domains (enriched in Pro, Glu, Ser, and Thr residues), and phosphatidylserine binding sites. Cavin1 is recruited to the plasma membrane by caveolins, and is also required for caveolae formation (Hill et al., 2008; Liu and Pilch, 2008) . Cavin2 promotes Cavin1 recruitment to caveolae and induces caveolae curvature (Hansen et al., 2009) . Cavin3 is involved in the intracellular transport of caveolae (McMahon et al., 2009) . Both Cavin2 and Cavin3 can bind to Cavin1, suggesting that these cavin proteins coordinate with each other to regulate caveolae formation (Hansen et al., 2009; Mohan et al., 2015) .",

Simian virus 40 (SV40), human coronavirus 229E, and hepatitis B virus enter cells through caveolae-dependent endocytosis (Pelkmans et al., 2001; Nomura et al., 2004; Macovei et al., 2010) . Caveolin1 has important roles in particle formation of several enveloped viruses. Parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV-5), a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, facilitates its assembly and budding at the surface of the plasma membrane by the binding of its M protein with Caveolin1, resulting in the promotion of viral growth (Ravid et al., 2010) . Although the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) protein that interacts with Caveolin1 has not been identified, filaments of RSV colocalize with Caveolin1, suggesting the importance of Caveolin1 for RSV virion maturation (Brown et al., 2002) . Caveolin1 also promotes growth of influenza A virus (IAV) via interaction between Caveolin1 and its M2 protein (Sun et al., 2010) . Caveolin1 seems to recruit viral components to where these viruses assemble and bud. In contrast, the role of cavin proteins during viral infection is poorly understood.",

COS cells were transfected with SR\u03b1 encoding hPIV-2 V or P gene together with FLAG-tagged Cavin3. Cavin3 was co-immunoprecipitated by V, but not P proteins ( Figure 4A, lanes 1-3) , indicating that the C-terminal region of V protein is important for the binding with Cavin3. As expected, a deletion mutant composed of only common regions of V and P proteins (V/P) could not bind to Cavin3 (Figure 4A, lane 4) . There are three Trp and seven Cys residues in C-terminal V-specific region, which are important for interaction with several host proteins (Figure 1 , and see \"Introduction\" section). To examine whether these residues are involved in binding with Cavin3, Trp-mutated V proteins (V W : V W178H/W182E/W192A ) and Cys-mutated (V C1 : V C193/197A , V C2 : V C209/211/214A , and V C3 : V C218/221A ) (Figure 1) were subjected to immunoprecipitation. Trp mutation lost the Cavin3 binding capacity, while all Cys mutants could bind to Cavin3 (Figure 4A , lanes 5-8). To identify the Cavin3 region important for V protein binding, three deletion mutants of Cavin3 with C-terminal FLAG tag were prepared ( Figure 4B) . Deletion of aa 1-78 of Cavin3 ( N78) did not affect V binding (Figure 4C, lane 3) . In contrast, N-terminally deleted Cavin3 consisting of aa 125-261 (N 124) and aa 140-261 (N 139) could not bind to the V protein ( Figure 4C, lanes 4 and 5) . Thus, aa 79-124 of Cavin3 are important for the binding to V protein.",

V protein seems to both positively and negatively regulate the stability of some host proteins. We expected that Cavin3 would be degraded through the calpain-dependent pathway because it possesses PEST sequences (Rogers et al., 1986; Shumway et al., 1999) . Its degradation was inhibited, however, by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor ( Figure 2C , middle panel). Cavin1 and Cavin2, both of which contain PEST sequences, are also degraded by the proteasome pathway (Breen et al., 2012; Tillu et al., 2015) . PEST sequence is reported to be involved in proteasome-dependent degradation pathways (Spencer et al., 2004) . However, as shown in Figure 4C , PEST sequences in Cavin3 were not the binding sites with V protein. V protein does not seem to directly mask the Cavin3 PEST sequences. Ubiquitylation of Lys residues within the phosphoinositide-binding site of Cavin1 leads to its degradation (Tillu et al., 2015) . As aa 79-124 of Cavin3 was found to contain the V binding site (Figure 4C) , V protein might mask the ubiquitylation sites within this region of Cavin3 by its binding.",

It is likely that a slight difference in the amounts of mRNA between HeLa/ctrl KD and HeLa/Cavin3 KD was negligible because the amounts of viral protein in HeLa/Cavin3 KD were similar to those in HeLa/ctrl KD (Figures 5D,E) . Cavin3 level in lipid rafts (insoluble fractions) was increased by V protein (Figure 6A, lane 5) . These results suggest the involvement of Cavin3 in the assembly and budding of hPIV-2 since lipid rafts are assembly and budding sites for several enveloped viruses, including measles virus (Vincent et al., 2000) , Newcastle disease virus (NDV) (Laliberte et al., 2006) , RSV (Brown et al., 2002) , and IAV (Scheiffele et al., 1999; Takeda et al., 2003) . Caveolin1 is incorporated in particles of PIV-5 (Ravid et al., 2010) , NDV (Laliberte et al., 2006) , and RSV (Brown et al., 2002) . RSV particles also contain Cavin1 (Ludwig et al., 2017) .

Caveolin1 binds to aromatic amino acid-rich region (FXXXXWXXF, corresponding to aa 355-363) of PIV-5 M (Ravid et al., 2010) . As this region is conserved in hPIV-2 M protein, hPIV-2 M protein seems to be clustered by Caveolin1. A faint amount of V protein was detected in detergent-insoluble fractions ( Figure 6A , lane 5). V protein might interact with Cavin3 before the recruitment of Cavin3 to the lipid rafts. The V protein in detergent-insoluble fractions ( Figure 6A , lane 5) may have been recruited by Cavin3. The role of V-Cavin3 interaction appears to be quite different from that between Caveolin1 and the viral proteins. It is reported that Cavin3 interacts with Cavin1 and Caveolin1, which leads to an increase in surface dynamics of caveolae (Mohan et al., 2015) . hPIV-2 V protein might enhance the Cavin3-induced activation of caveolae dynamics by stabilizing Cavin3 expression.",
