In the past few weeks, our outpatient department in Germany has received numerous calls from worried doctors of companies doing business in Asia. These calls have increased since the claim was made that within 2 years every citizen of Hong Kong will be infected with SARS. A German newspaper2 fitted an exponential curve to the cumulative number of probable SARS cases (as reported by WHO3), forecasting a progressively steeper increase in case numbers. Such predictions can have enormous economic repercussions, so they should be scientifically tenable; we do not believe they are.",

Microsoft Excel calculates an R\n2 of 0\u00b798 for an exponential curve, indicating an excellent fit (figure, A\n). Using the function of the curve, we can predict a total of 71 583 cases 60 days later. The exponential curve matches the dynamics of an epidemic in a closed population with a high basic reproductive number R0, which corresponds to the average number of new cases that one infectious case is expected to produce. Under such conditions, almost everyone will become infected during the epidemic.4 However, a linear curve can be fitted to the same data, yielding an equally impressive R\n2 of 0.96, but predicting only 2410 cases 60 days later. Moreover, R\n2 statistics are invalid with cumulative data because the assumption that observations are independent is violated.",

Furthermore, the outbreak in a housing estate in late March is not followed by a pronounced peak of secondary cases 2\u20137 days later, as would be expected if R0 was generally high. These data are compatible with the hypothesis of uncommon but effective modes of transmission, in combination with an overall R0 that is not exceptionally high. Given the possibility of waning immunity, the data are also consistent with an emerging endemic situation in which a part of the population will be affected seasonally.4, 5\n",
