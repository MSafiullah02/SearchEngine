Inclusion body hepatitis (IBH), hydropericardium syndrome (HPS), and gizzard erosion (GE) associated with FAdV-I infection have been reported worldwide, e.g., in Pakistan (Khawaja et al. 1988; Mansoor et al. 2009), Chile (Toro et al. 1999), Korea (Choi et al. 2012), Canada (Dar et al. 2012), Hungary (Kaj\u00e1n et al. 2013), India (Mittal et al. 2014), Japan (Mase and Nakamura 2014), South Africa (Joubert et al. 2014), Mexico (Vera-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. 2016), Poland (Niczyporuk 2016), and China (Zhao et al. 2015), resulting in significant economic losses to the poultry industry. HPS is caused by FAdV-4 (Pan et al. 2017a), whereas IBH is always related to FAdV-2, FAdV-11, FAdV-8a, or FAdV-8b (Morshed et al. 2017) and GE is mainly caused by FAdV-1 (Matczuk et al. 2017). Notably, severe HPS, with a high mortality rate of 20\u201380%, caused by a novel genotype FAdV-4 has been widespread in China since 2015 (Li et al. 2016; Pan et al. 2017a) and is a major threat to the poultry industry.",

            "text": "In recent years, a variety of FAdVs detection methods have been developed for large-scale seroepidemiological investigations and HPS vaccine evaluation. For antigen detection, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (G\u00fcnes et al. 2012), quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Pan et al. 2017c), high-resolution melting (HRM) curve analysis (Steer et al. 2009), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (Yuan et al. 2019; Zhai et al. 2019), and sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (Shao et al. 2019a; Shao et al. 2019b) have been developed. The traditional methods for FAdVs serological diagnosis are agar gel precipitation (AGPT) and virus neutralization (VN) tests. While AGPT is generally less sensitive, the process of VN is not conducive to rapid and large-scale diagnosis. Thus, a simple, rapid, and sensitive diagnostic method is urgently required for FAdVs detection, for which ELISA, which is widely used in large-scale serological investigation, is simple to operate, and has high sensitivity, is an excellent candidate technology.",

The immune response to vaccines is generally monitored by the presence of an antigen-specific antibody and the neutralization antibody. In one recent study, recombinant fiber-based indirect ELISA was used to detect serum samples from chickens experimentally inoculated with different FAdV-1 or FAdV-4 strains (Feichtner et al. 2018). A recombinant hexon-based single serum dilution ELISA was also developed to measure the hexon-specific antibodies against FAdV-4 in sera of chickens (Rajasekhar and Roy 2014). Both of the ELISAs mentioned above were FAdV serotype-specific and based on variable recombinant proteins. However, some other FAdV serotypes, such as FAdV-1 and FAdV-8a, have also been shown to cause serious economic losses to the poultry industry.",

The pathogenic FAdV-4 strain has been isolated and characterized as a novel genotype (Ye et al. 2016). However, there are currently no commercial FAdV-I or FAdV-4 ELISA kits in China for detection of antibodies against the pathogenic FAdVs or FAdV-4 specifically. Many studies have been conducted on FAdVs antibody detection using ELISA based on FAdV-1. In one study, CELO (FAdV-1) virus was used as a coating antigen to establish an ELISA method for detecting FAdV-1 and avian adenovirus-associated virus (Dawson et al. 1980). As reported, FAdV-4 showed higher cross-reactivity among 10 serotypes than did FAdV-1 (Calnek et al. 1982). Given that homologous ELISA reactions were stronger than heterologous reactions in many cases, we evaluated FAdV-4 as a coating antigen to develop a common ELISA for detecting all twelve FAdV-I serotypes. The ELISA developed based on FAdV-4 in this study showed considerable cross-reaction within the twelve FAdV-I serotypes and higher sensitivity than the FAdV-1-based ELISA for detecting antibodies against the novel emergent FAdV-4. Ultimately, we successfully established a common ELISA for specifically detecting antibodies against all twelve FAdV-I serotypes, which could be a powerful tool for seroepidemiological investigation of IBH, GE, and, especially, the emergent HPS in China.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, there is no commercial vaccine against FAdVs, including the FAdV-4 strain, and a common detection method is urgently needed to facilitate vaccine development and evaluation. Though several recombinant protein-based ELISAs have been used to detect antibodies in chickens inoculated with subunit vaccines, such as rFiber-1, rFiber-2, and rHexon protein, these ELISA were able to detect antibodies against FAdV-4-specific (Feichtner et al. 2018; He et al. 2018; Rai et al. 2005; Rajasekhar and Roy 2014). Furthermore, prokaryotic expressed proteins need to be renatured to restore tertiary and quaternary spatial structures, which may lead to false-negative results from assays using recombinant proteins. Considering that FAdV-4 and some other serotypes within FAdV-I are pathogenic to chickens worldwide (Grgi\u0107 et al. 2011; Lim et al. 2011; Morshed et al. 2017), a common ELISA should be more suitable for FAdVs vaccine development. The common ELISA developed in our study was applied to detect serum samples from SPF chickens inoculated with inactivated FAdV-1, FAdV-4, and FAdV-8a, and showed high sensitivity for all three FAdV hypervirulent serotypes. These results suggest that the common ELISA developed in our study is capable of monitoring antibodies against all serotypes in variable FAdV-I vaccine development and evaluation.",
