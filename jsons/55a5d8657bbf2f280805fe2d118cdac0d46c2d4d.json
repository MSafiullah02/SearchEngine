The aim of this study was to identify di\u00a1erences between incidence rates, risk factors, clinical presentations, and outcomes of candidemia in SOT recipients and non-SOT patients. Data from the multicenter prospective Australian Candidaemia Study were examined. From August 2001 to July 2004, 24 episodes (2.2%; 24/1068) of candidemia were identi\u00a2ed in SOT recipients. During this period, the numbers of transplanted organs included liver (n 5 455), kidney (n 5 1605), single lung (n 5 57 ), bilateral lung (n 5 183), heart and lung (n 5 18), heart (n 5 157 ), and pancreas (n 5 62). The overall annual estimated incidence of candidemia in SOT recipients was higher (3 per 1000 transplant admissions) than in non-SOT patients (incidence 0.21 per 1000 admissions; Po0.001).The incidence and timing of candidemia post transplant was in\u00a3uenced by the transplanted organ type, with the majority of episodes (n 5 14, 54%) occurring 46 months after renal transplantation. Risk factors for candidemia in the month preceding diagnosis were similar to non-SOT recipients except for corticosteroid therapy (Po0.001). Antifungal prophylaxis did not select for more resistant or non-albicans Candida species in the SOTgroup. The 30 -day all-cause mortality was similar to non-SOT patients with candidemia and remains high at 21%. All deaths in SOT recipients occurred early (within 5 days of diagnosis), underlining a need for better diagnostic tests, targeted prevention, and early treatment strategies.",

Manifestations range from mucosal colonization to disseminated disease with most infections occurring in the early post-transplant period (within 30 days) (1, 6, 7 ) . Invasive infections are associated with signi\u00a2cant morbidity and reported mortality rates that range from 5^77% (4, 6) . The epidemiology and outcome of invasive candidiasis in SOT recipients are in-\u00a3uenced by the type of organ transplanted. Candidemia occurs most frequently in liver and pancreatic transplant recipients (1^32%) followed closely by heart and/or lung transplant recipients (1^16%) (8) . In contrast, renal transplant recipients have among the lowest rates reported (2%) (7, 8) . SOT recipients share many of the same risk factors for candidemia as non-transplanted patients. These include broad-spectrum antibiotic use, total parenteral nutrition, long-term central venous lines, and prolonged stay in intensive care. In addition, speci\u00a2c risk factors for candidemia in SOT recipients include immunosuppression and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (9^11).",

The choice of antifungal agent is dependent on the need for anti-mold activity, which, like the incidence of candidemia, di\u00a1ers between the types of solid organs transplanted. Although the use of antifungal prophylaxis together with improvements in surgery and posttransplant care has reduced overall rates of Candida infection in SOT recipients, breakthrough infections continue to occur (particularly with non-albicans Candida species) (2, 4) . Further, it remains unknown whether antifungal prophylaxis in SOT recipients has in\u00a3uenced the burden of candidemia and/or the all-cause mortality rates in these patients compared with non-SOT patients.

This di\u00a1ers substantially from other studies where late-onset candidemia occurred in o1% of blood stream infections with no documented cases in 1400 renal transplants over a 2-year period (18, 19) . The reasons for this di\u00a1erence are unexplained. Although the epidemiology of lateonset candidemia is not well de\u00a2ned, the development of candidemia in SOT recipients in our study may be a marker of severe underlying illness, as 12 of the 13 late-onset episodes were hospital inpatients at the time of diagnosis and had multiple risk factors for candidemia.These risk factors included receipt of broad-spectrum antibiotics for concurrent bacterial infections, ongoing immunosuppression, and indwelling medical devices such as urinary catheters and vascular access devices. It is not surprising that most cases of late-onset candidemia occurred in renal transplant recipients, as this is the most common type of transplant performed and is generally associated with the longest survival times (20) . Although we found predisposing factors for candidemia in SOT recipients to be similar to those in non-SOT patients (with the exception of corticosteroid use), studies of large numbers of patients with SOT are required to identify speci\u00a2c risk factors for this group of individuals, especially in those with late-onset candidemia.",

Surprisingly, mortality rates were similar to non-SOTpatients, despite the increased use of corticosteroids in the SOTgroup (Table 2) , which has been documented as an independent factor for all-cause mortality in candidemia (12) . However, compared with non-SOT patients, SOT recipients were more likely to die within the \u00a2rst 5 days of candidemia diagnosis. This may re\u00a3ect a higher burden of disease in SOT recipients, contributed to by a poor in\u00a3ammatory response leading to a lack of classic clinical and radiological signs of candidal infection (1).Thus, delays in the commencement of therapeutic antifungal agents result in rapid progression of infection. All these factors are further compounded by a reliance on a relatively insensitive 'gold standard' test (i.e., blood cultures) (23) . These issues may be addressed in the future with non-culture-based diagnostic methods, although their sensitivity and speci\u00a2city are highly variable and not well evaluated in SOT recipients (24, 25) . Antifungal prophylaxis has not been shown to reduce allcause mortality in SOT recipients in randomized controlled trials (21) . This may be secondary to unwanted consequences of azole antifungal prophylaxis, including drugd rug interactions resulting in toxicity-related morbidity or due to breakthrough fungal infections (26) . Such breakthrough infections include non-albicans Candida species, which have been associated with higher attributable mortality rates compared with C. albicans infections (27 ) . In our study, azole antifungal prophylaxis was not associated with selection of non-albicans Candida species in SOT recipients or increased mortality. This may re\u00a3ect the small number of SOT recipients studied, because these associations were demonstrated in the total population (12) .",
