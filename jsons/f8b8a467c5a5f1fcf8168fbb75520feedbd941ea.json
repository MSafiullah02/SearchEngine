In addition, viral tropism to uroepithelial cells which has been implicated as a cause of the commonly observed acute renal failure in patients with MERS CoV pneumonia may have played a role in causing acute renal failure in this patient as well (10) . In an attempt to treat the severe MERS CoV pneumonia, interferon a2a in combination with ribavirin was initiated based on a previous in vitro study where interferon a2b was found to lead to a dose dependent reduction in the number of genome copies of MERS CoV as well as a reduction in the cytopathic effect, which was magnified when combined with ribavirin in an in vitro model (11) . This has led the authors to test this combination in an animal model (macaques) 8 h after they were inoculated with MERS CoV with favorable outcomes (12) . The choice of interferon a2a instead of interferon a2b was due to the lack of interferon a2b availability. Failure of this regimen has been demonstrated in a case series that consisted of five patients with severe MERS CoV pneumonia, all of whom had a poor outcome (13) . This combination was started late in both our cases and the case series by a minimum of 8 days postadmission with pneumonia. Whether the poor outcome in those cases is related to the delay in administration of treatment or due to lack of true in vivo efficacy in humans is difficult to conclude in the absence of controlled studies. Moreover, a more recent in vitro study demonstrated that interferon a2b has superior anti-MERS CoV activity compared to interferon a2a evidenced by a lower IC50 (14) . Whether these factors have led to this patient's poor outcome, and whether other factors are involved is impossible to conclude based on the very limited data available.",

            "text": "It is interesting that despite the recent T-lymphocyte depletion with antithymocyte globulin prior to transplantation in the second case 6 weeks prior to his presentation with MERS CoV pneumonia, the patient had a relatively mild illness and an excellent clinical recovery. The positive outcome may be related in part to the patient's young age. Other factors may have had a positive impact on the outcome but this cannot be determined from a single case. None of the above patients had contact with similarly ill patients. However, the second patient started exhibiting symptoms 12 days after his discharge from the hospital. So his infection may have been from a nosocomial source, as nosocomial transmission has been a major obstacle in the control of MERS infections (15) . Both patients were placed in isolation rooms once MERS diagnosis was suspected.",
