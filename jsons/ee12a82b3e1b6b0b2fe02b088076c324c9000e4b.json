Because there was no thermal load from the equipment, such as incubators and laminar flow hoods, or from workers, the temperature was kept constant. The room with nitrogen banks was maintained with minimum operations to prevent the accumulation of nitrogen vapors. The few staff remaining cared for the maintenance and quality control of banks, refrigerators, freezers, and their mechanics. Material that could degrade was carefully inventoried to best estimate when to place new orders.",

One of the main reasons for the initial closure was to protect staff from infections inside the clinic. The first action after the pandemic ebbs will be to reinstate staff, including clinicians, embryologists, and nurses. We should test all for immunity, because those who are immune would be safest to restart the clinic and obviate the necessity for the use of PPE. Those who are not immune, assuming that we do not yet have a vaccine, are a dilemma. One approach would be regular evaluation of symptoms, tracking contacts with known cases, temperature checks, and, if possible, regular viral tests (2).",

All IVF units should have these tests available to assess immunity in all individuals entering the centers.

The filters that we use in our laboratories and procedure rooms are high efficiency particle air (HEPA) filters that are able to filter 97% of 0.3-\u00b5m particulate matter, but respiratory droplets carrying virus may vary from 0.01 to 10 \u00b5m.

Studies performed with entirely different types of viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, or hepatitis B virus, failed to detect viral sequences after culture and vitrification of oocytes and embryos from seropositive patients (4) . We must also consider that the surface-spike glycoproteins of the virus would be able to recognize its functional receptor, the metallopeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, in the sperm, the oocyte, or the blastomeres. This protein is abundant in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine (5) . It is also observed in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs, which of course include the endometrium, ovaries, and testes (5) . Whether the virus exists in these organs and how it might be cleared by future antiviral therapy remains an open question.",
