In total, 93 stool samples were taken from 26 patients (Table S1); the first sample was taken on the day of admission. The median age of patients is 57 years (range, 30 to 80). Most of the patients were elderly, with 42.3% aged older than 65 years, 5 patients were over 75 years of age (19.2%). Males predominate in number over females, about 69.2% were men. Of the 26 patients, 24 were discharged from hospital and 2 died. This study represents 65% (26/40) of all lab confirmed cases in our hospital. 17 patients (65.4%) received antibiotic therapy within six hours after admission. Commonly used antibiotics included piperacillin-tazobactam (n = 12), moxifloxacin (n = 9), sulbactam-cefoperazone (n = 3), imipenem-cilastatin (n = 4), vancomycin (n = 7), and piperacillin-sulbactam (n = 3). Remarkably, 24 patients (92.3%) were treated with Clostridium tablets, 2 patients (7.7%) received B. Subtilis and E. faecium enteric coated capsules and Clostridium tablets, and 1 patient received Clostridium tablets and Bacillus capsules (Tables 1 and S1).",

Only one sample from each patient (26) and healthy individual (31) was taken for comparison. The clean reads from the sequencing data (Table S3) were aligned against the reference genomes from NCBI and HMP database (Table S4). The relative abundance of phylum, genus and species among healthy control (H) groups, patients treated with antibiotic (AB) and without antibiotic (NAB) are shown in Fig. 1. Phylotypes with a median relative abundance greater than 0.01% (p < 0.01), calculated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test in either the H group or H7N9 patients were included for comparison. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were dominant in the faecal microbial communities of all groups (Fig. 1a,c,e). Compared with H group, H7N9 patients had fewer Bacteroidetes in NAB group and fewer Firmicutes in AB group, but higher levels of Proteobacteria in both groups. At the genus level, Bacteroides was dominant in all groups (Fig. 1b,d,f). In AB group, Escherichia and Parabacteroides were the second and third genus in faecal microbial communities respectively whereas in NAB group, Clostridium and Parabacteroides were the second and third. In contrast, in H group Eubacterium and Roseburia were the second and third, respectively. The top 20 species are shown in Fig. 2. Ofthe top 20 species in AB group and NAB group, Escherichia coli represents the most and second most abundant species respectively, indicating that Escherichia coli are potentially pathogenic bacteria and whose abundance levels may correlate with the progression of H7N9 infection and associated treatment. We also found Enterococcus faecium as enriched in patient groups. It is worthy to note that Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which is recognized as an anti-inflammatory probiotics17, was dramatically decreased in AB group. These results show large differences in the microbial communities between the H7N9 patients and the healthy individuals.",

Enterococcus faecium and Veillonella parvula were more abundant in the patient groups as was Clostridium butyricum, likely because of its administration as probiotic. In contrast, Bacteroides vulgates was observed to be the most abundant in H group, significantly more than in AB and NAB groups (Figs 2a and 3b).

Here we compared the within-sample diversity (Shannon index) among healthy controls and H7N9 infected patients treated with (n = 17) or without (n = 9) antibiotics (Fig. 4a). Very interestingly, viral infection led to a significant decrease of diversity, there was significant difference in the within-sample diversity between NAB group and control (p < 0.01, Student t-test), also between AB group and control (p < 0.001, Student t-test). The decreased diversity is further exacerbated by antibiotics administration, although the difference was not statistically significant between AB and NAB group (p = 0.26 by the Student t-test).",

It has been shown previously that antibiotic perturbation may shift the gut microbiota community structure to an alternatives state12. We examined the enterotypes of all samples (n = 93) from H7N9 virus infected patients and controls (n = 31) by PAM clustering with four distance metrics method (Fig. S1). The best cluster number at the genus level was three (Fig. S1). Two enterotypes were driven by the genera Bacteroides and Prevotella similar to previous studies in European and Chinese cohorts (Fig. 4c)910. The third enterotype was driven by the genus Klebsiella and includes only the H7N9 infected patients. We hypothesize that the infection causes the shift of the communities to this enterotype, which is different from those previously reported. Interestingly, the samples from same patient fluctuate between different enterotypes within a short time (<8 days; Table S3). Furthermore, assessment of the proximity of patients by the Spearman correlation analysis indicates that different samples from the same patient do not cluster together (Fig. S2). We conclude that the gut microbial communities in patients are unstable whereas in the healthy individuals they are rather stable18. This may be due, at least in part, to the very significant loss of diversity observed upon infection.",

Totally 3,592,885 open reading frames (ORFs) from the 1.3 million contigs were predicted. The final non-redundant gut gene set contained 1,171,674 ORFs with an average length of 722 bp. Then the H7N9 virus infected patient gut microbial gene set was compared to other available gene set like MetaHIT10, HMP gut8, and T2D10. The HMP data set contains sequencing data from multiple human body sites, we here only use gut data from HMP data set. Among all four gene sets, the virus, MetaHIT, HMP gut and T2D gene sets contain 528,592, 1,732,369, 3,123,458 and 867,049 unique genes, respectively (Fig. 5). MetaHIT and HMP gut have 20.55% and 37.06% unique genes, respectively, which imply that the gut genes are very different across continents. Virus and T2D sets contained 6.27% and 10.29% unique genes, respectively, and large differences were observed in the two gene sets derived from Chinese cohorts. We next investigate the functional role of the shared or uniquely present genes. We annotated the unique genes in every gene set into KEGG database, because there is huge gene number difference among four gene sets, so percentage of genes in each gene set is used for comparison. The most abundant KEGG orthologous group in all four gene sets was enzyme families, and then membrane transport and Carbohydrate metabolism (Fig. 6a). We also performed similar analysis using eggNOG database and find the most unique genes function are either function unknown or uncharacterized, the next most abundant categories are general function prediction only, amino acid transport and metabolism (Fig. 6b).",

In contrast, most of MGS enriched in the H7N9 patients were Clostridium sp. 7 2 43FAA, Enterococcus, Enterobacter and Clostridium butyricum. It is worthy of note that Enterococcus and Enterobacter have been reported to play crucial roles of the gastrointestinal tract infections, lower respiratory tract infections, skin and soft-tissue infections, urinary tract infections, endocarditis, CNS infections, septic arthritis, intra-abdominal infections, and ophthalmic infections2122.",

Interestingly, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium could be inferred, on the basis of relationship patterns, to be harmful, in line with previous studies, which concluded that they may cause or underlie bacteraemia and intra-abdominal infections2324. Interestingly, Clostridium butyricum was enriched in both AB and NAB patient groups, furthermore, NAB group has a higher abundance than AB group, indicating that Clostridium tablets may exert their functions in the gut (Fig. 3b). In contrast, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroidesovatus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia intestinalis, Eubacteriumeligens, Bifidobacterium longumand Haemophilus parainfluenzae may have a beneficial impact in this specific biological context. In particular, the finding here that Haemophilus parainfluenzae was enriched in healthy controls is consistent with the result from MGWAS study10, which imply an unknown function of this known pathogen. In our study, patients with H7N9 of different treatment regimens had similar gut community changes. These results led to a conclusion that composition changes observed between H7N9 patients and healthy controls were mainly due to viral infection and associated treatment.",

The clustering analysis of these samples showed that they also could be grouped into three enterotypes as in previous studies but with a different third enterotype driven by Klebsiella, which included the patients only. We suggest that this enterotype may correspond to specific microbial communities that form in H7N9 infected individuals. The enterotypes are not stable, possibly due to the conjunction of viral infection and low diversity. The MGS analysis was performed in this study and this was reported possibly to be markers for specific disease20.
