            "text": "The incidence of lower airway infections in immunocompromised patients is high and the course of a disease is usually more severe than that in immunocompetent hosts (Sousa et al. 2013; Bonatti et al. 2009). Mortality rate largely depends on the type and severity of immunosuppression, with the highest rate reported after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and somewhat lower in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients and patients with hematologic malignancies (HM) (Cervera et al. 2006; Ra\u00f1\u00f3 et al. 2001; 2002). It has also been shown that the outcome of pulmonary infections is significantly affected by a delay in diagnosis of specific etiology. An increase in mortality rate from 29 to 71 % has been reported in patients in whom the etiology of infection was ascertained within the first 7 days of onset of symptoms compared with those with later diagnosis (Ra\u00f1\u00f3 et al. 2001). The etiology of lower respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised patients is diverse. It includes common bacteria, uncommon bacterial agents, and opportunistic pathogens such as various fungal species and viruses. Although atypical bacteria are important causes of pulmonary infections in the general population, data on the role of these pathogens in immunocompromised patients are relatively scarce. In the immunocompetent hosts Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae are responsible for 1\u201336 % and 3\u201322 % of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases, respectively (Singanayagam et al. 2014; Masi\u00e1 et al. 2007; Gleason 2002). The majority of these infections affect children and young adults and present as mild, self-limiting disease (Capelastegui et al. 2012). However, even 26 % of patients may require hospital admission and in-hospital death rate may be as high as 5 %. The prevalence of Legionella pneumophila pneumonia in the general population is slightly lower (2\u201316 %), but this infection is usually more severe. In two studies, L. pneumophila was responsible for 2\u20139 % of CAP that required hospitalization (Yu and Stout 2008; Gleason 2002). On the other hand, recent data do not confirm the relation between L. pneumophila infection and increased in-hospital mortality rate (Capelastegui et al. 2012).",

            "text": "It might be hypothesized that the course of atypical pulmonary infections in immunocompromised patients can be more severe than that in the general population and that the co-infection with atypical pathogens can aggravate the course of pulmonary disease caused by typical bacteria or fungi. Surprisingly, there are little data on the incidence and clinical features of atypical pulmonary infections in immunocompromised patients. According to the available publications, the incidence of these infections is quite low (Corti et al. 2009; Jain et al. 2004; Perez and Leigh 1991). However, a few cases of life threatening pneumonia caused by C. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila have been described (Di Stefano et al. 2007; Heinemann et al. 2000). Whether the true prevalence of atypical pathogen infections in immunocompromised hosts is low or it is underestimated due to low sensitivity of the diagnostic methods seems to be an interesting issue. It must be realized that the culture of atypical bacteria is difficult and demanding and can be offered by few laboratories only. Serological methods, including specific IgM and IgG antibodies detection in the serum, have limited clinical application due to a delay in the diagnosis and suboptimal sensitivity in patients with immunoglobulin deficiency (false negative results) (Bartlett 2008; Hammerschlag 2000; Welti et al. 2003). Likewise, L. pneumophila antigen detection in the urine has limited sensitivity as a negative result of this test does not exclude infection with other than serotype 1 L. pneumophila strains. The introduction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods that can identify specific genetic material in different biological samples, including broncholaveolar lavage fluid (BALF), throat swabs, and nasopharyngeal samples, enables a rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnosis of atypical pathogen infection even if patients are already treated with an antibiotic (Murdoch 2004; Welti et al. 2003; Murdoch 2003). Therefore, the aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of atypical lower airway infections using nested PCR (nPCR) method in patients with various types of immunosuppression and to analyze clinical characteristics of these infections.",

M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila were found in 9.7 %, 2.8 %, and 0 % of patients, respectively. Thus, the prevalence of these infections in this study was somewhat lower than that usually reported in immunocompetent patients with CAP (Capelastegui et al. 2012; Masi\u00e1 et al. 2007). On the other hand, the percentage of patients in whom atypical pathogens (except L. pneumophila) were identified was slightly higher as compared with other studies in immunocompromised hosts (Cervera et al. 2006; Hohenthal et al. 2005; Jain et al. 2004; Dan\u00e9s et al. 2002). This difference can be easily explained by multiple factors that can influence the results of various studies. These include: environmental factors (community or hospital acquired infection), seasonal and local epidemiological situation, type, severity and duration of immunosuppression, methods applied for pathogen detection and identification, reporting method (per entire study group or per subgroup with specific cause of immunoincompetence), and treatment applied prior to microbiological sampling. Despite all these conditions, most authors agree that atypical pulmonary infections in immunocompromised hosts are rather uncommon. Depending on the source of data, typical bacteria, fungi, and viruses have been responsible for 18\u201351 %, 8\u201338 %, and 9\u201323 % of pulmonary infections in non-HIV immunocompromised patients, respectively (Camps Serra et al. 2008; Jain et al. 2004; Dan\u00e9s et al. 2002; Ra\u00f1\u00f3 et al. 2001).

            "text": "In this study, diagnosis of pulmonary infection caused by atypical bacteria was based on a sole microbiological test, i.e., identification of specific DNA sequences in lavage fluid collected directly from the site of infection. The role of fiberoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage as a diagnostic tool in immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infiltrates is well established. It has been shown that an early bronchoscopy (<5 days) has a significantly higher diagnostic yield for pulmonary infections than the late bronchoscopy (78 vs. 23 %; p = 0.02) (Lucena et al. 2014). The role of diagnostic methods other than culture in the work-up of immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infections has also been positively verified, albeit ELISA tests for the detection of C. pneumoniae and/or M. pneumoniae antibodies have some limitations, due to well-known cross reactions with other Chlamydia and Mycoplasma species. Hohenthal et al. (2005) have shown that the use of PCR and antigen detection to identify infectious agents in BALF from patients with hematological malignancies significantly improves the diagnostic yield. Unfortunately, although M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae PCR tests were performed in 37 and 29 BALF samples, respectively, the authors have neither presented nor discussed these results. Similar to the present study, none of the BALF samples evaluated by Hohenthal et al. (2005) tested positively for Legionella spp. in PCR tests. There are, however, two points which should be mentioned when comparing the results of these two studies. Firstly, the number of BALF samples evaluated by Hohenthal et al. (2005) has been almost two-fold higher than that in the present study. Secondly, In the Finnish study both PCR method and cultures have been applied and there was one patient with a positive culture but negative Legionella spp. PCR test. Thus, we cannot exclude that some patients with legionellosis could have been found in the present study, had other than PCR diagnostic methods been used. Nevertheless, the results of both studies point to a very low prevalence of L. pneumophila pulmonary infection in immunocompromised patients. That seems inconsistent with the results of some earlier studies which showed that hematological malignancies are a significant risk factor (rate ratio 22.4) for L. pneumophila pneumonia (Marston et al. 1994). Furthermore, as the course of pulmonary infections in immunocompromised patients is often severe and L. pneumophila is a well-known pathogen responsible for severe pneumonias, a higher prevalence of this infection could be expected in immunocompromised patients. Therefore, some methodological issues that could have negatively influenced the prevalence of L. pneumophila infections found in the present study should be considered. The hypothesis that extremely low prevalence of L. pneumophila infection was related to false negative PCR results is highly unlikely. Contrary to the above mentioned data (positive L. pneumophila culture and false negative PCR test) numerous other studies demonstrate that Legionella PCR has a sensitivity equal to, or greater than, culture. A PCR test can give false negative results when polymerase inhibitors are present in the biological sample (Hammerschlag 2000). It has been shown that in M. pneumoniae infections, throat swabs are preferred over nasopharyngeal samples due to a lower rate of PCR inhibitors (Murdoch 2003). As PCR inhibitors are usually nonspecific, their presence would have caused false negative results not only in terms of L. pneumophila infection but also other pathogens, i.e., M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae. This was not the case in our study, as an external control of DNA extraction and amplification was used simultaneously and no inhibition was observed during this study. Early and adequate antibiotic therapy before sample collection can be another cause of false negative results of microbiological studies. In fact, a significant proportion of our patients (65.3 %), including 7/9 patients with atypical bacterial infection, had been treated with macrolides or fluoroquinolones before or at the time of diagnostic bronchoscopy. Prior studies in patients with pneumonia have shown that bronchoalveolar lavage performed within 3 days of antibiotic therapy onset has a diagnostic yield of 63.4 %, while the diagnostic value decreases to 57.6 % and 34.4 %, when lavage is done later on, before and after 14 days of treatment initiation, respectively (Kottmann et al. 2011). The argument against the confounding role of prior treatment for the results obtained in the present study is that PCR tests allow detecting genetic material of causative pathogen even a few weeks after initiation of antibiotic therapy (Welti et al. 2003).",

This is somewhat inconsistent with Guti\u00e9rrez et al.\u2019s (2006) findings who have reported the highest incidence of M.pneumoniae CAP in young and very elderly people, and the lowest between 45 and 64 years of age. To our knowledge, no specific data have been published on the gender-related or age-related differences in the prevalence of atypical pathogen infection in immunocompromised patients.
