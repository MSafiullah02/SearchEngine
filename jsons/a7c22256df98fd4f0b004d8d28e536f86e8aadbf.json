The maturity of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA is crucial for the cessation of the seizure activity and to balance the glutamate excitatory system. Secondly, incomplete brain myelination (myelination begins in the last stage of gestation and continues for the first six months of age) contributes to the increase risk of seizures in the immature brain (Kubova et al., 1994) .",

The reduced GI absorptive capabilities of younger animals can lower the systemic AEDs serum level and efficacy (Boothe and Tannert 1992) . The increase in percentage of body water content can affect the distribution of water soluble AEDs such as bromide. Younger animals have a lower serum protein concentration that can lead to an overdosage of protein bound AEDs (phenobarbitone and diazepam). Additionally, the immature liver is responsible for decreased metabolism of phenobarbitone, diazepam and gabapentin (one third of which is metabolised by the liver in dogs), leading to an increased risk of AED toxicosis. Finally, reduced renal clearance present in immature dogs can be particularly important when using the water soluble AEDs such as bromide and gabapentin.",

The initial diagnostic evaluation, following an isolated seizure episode, should include a haemogram, a biochemistry profile including serum glucose, cholinesterase (the poisonous effect of organophosphorous and carbamate pesticides comes about through the inhibition of cholinesterase) and lead level, urinalysis, and serum bile acids. Faecal examination should be part of the minimum database in younger animals, where an intestinal parasitic burden can induce anaemia, hypoglycaemia, and hypoproteinaemia and ultimately trigger seizure activity. Skull radiographs, and cerebral ultrasound through an open fontanel can help in identifying the presence of trauma and ventriculomegaly respectively. Cerebral MRI and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis are recommended to investigate intracranial congenital disorders, such as hydrocephalus or lissencephaly, inflammatory disease and congenital brain tumours even if rarely reported (Smith et al., 2007) . When infectious disease is suspected, additional tests to perform on CSF include PCR, titres and culture (Table 2) .",

Moreover, the main factor that determines more persistent epilepsy, following on from early seizures, is protracted seizure episodes (Schimd et al., 1999; McCabe et al., 2001; Dulac et al., 2007) . Early and rational anti-epileptic treatment should be instituted in younger patients with a history of more than one seizure, cluster seizures or status epilepticus, despite the underlying cause. In fact, better seizure control and satisfactory long-term management are achievable where early, appropriate and aggressive anticonvulsant treatment is initiated. If and when an underlying cause can be identified and remedied (i.e. toxin exposure), anticonvulsant treatment can be slowly withdrawn over time; the suggestion is to reduce the dose by 25% every 3-4 weeks up to 5-6 months if the puppy or kitten has remained seizure free (Hoskins 2001) . It is important to make the owner aware of the difficulty in attaining acceptable seizure control in some patients despite appropriate AED treatment. In cases with cluster seizure activity and status epilepticus, phenobarbitone and diazepam can be given per rectum, intravenously, intranasally, or via intraosseus and intraperitoneal routes; bromide can also be given per os or per rectum but has a much longer half life generally prohibiting its use in emergent situations.",

The reduced renal function allows shortening of the bromide halflife (~ 25 days in adult dogs), reaching steady state earlier and improving the seizure control (Bergman and Coates 2005). Typical side effects reported in adults are polydipsia, polyuria and polyphagia with the possible increased risk of pancreatitis. Bromide has been recently reported to have a very efficacious anticonvulsant activity in cats (Volk et al., 2006) , with the advantage of not being metabolised by the liver. However, Br has been associated with a high frequency of respiratory complications (~ 70%), similar to feline asthma syndrome. Respiratory complications can develop at any time during the treatment and may or may not be steroid responsive. Discontinuation of Br can resolve the respiratory signs in approximately 50% of the cases. However, the respiratory side effects have been severe in several cases, related to a fatal eosinophilic bronchopneumonia (Boothe and George, 2002) . The owner should be made aware of this potentially severe, life threatening complication associated with Br therapy in cats.",
