Site-specific characteristics, described by site locations and availability of amenities in close vicinity, are often set by the town planning group (HKPSG, 2011), which is a constraint beyond the control of site planners and architects. Property-specific characteristics, on the contrary, are not stipulated in local codes and regulations; site planners and architects are generally allowed to design the construction the way they deem proper (EPD, 2006, JPN1, 2001, JPN2, 2002, PNAP, 2013). These characteristics, contributed by architectural and environmental attributes, therefore, vary significantly in different residential units.",

According to the global house-price indicators published in \u201cThe Economist\u201d in 2011, Hong Kong tops the world in residential property prices. Results of the 2009/2010 household expenditure survey also showed that the weight of expenditure Hong Kong people incur on housing was the highest among expenses under all heads, accounting for over 32% of the total household expenditure. Thus the influence of a residential property's characteristics on its market value is of particular importance to Hong Kong people when making home buying decisions, and on the contrary, to building developers when making investment decisions.",

Many others have found that government policies on town planning (Sagalyn & Sternlieb, 1973) land supply (Hannah, Kim, & Mills, 1993) and tax system (Bramley, 1993) affect property prices significantly. However, economic and government policies impact the residential property market as a whole only, while market value of individual residential units is affected more by site-specific characteristics. Some studies have examined influence of individual property-specific features also. However, little seems to have been done for investigating the relative and combined influence of different property-specific characteristics.",

In this study, the hedonic price method is adopted for determining the market value of each property-specific attribute. However, use of the hedonic price method requires development of performance indicators that are known to homebuyers. This is less of a problem for architectural attributes which can easily be understood by homebuyers but is a problem in case of environmental attributes. Accordingly, a series of studies has been done by the authors for developing performance indicators for quantifying a residential unit's environmental qualities (Fung and Lee, 2012, Fung and Lee, 2011, Fung and Lee, 2014). Through the use of the hedonic price method, the marginal WTP and ES for each architectural and environmental attribute are determined for the information of homebuyers and building developers.",

These findings explain why in the last few years, nearly all new residential estates have club houses and developers often use them as one of the key selling points. Moreover, Jud and Watt (1981) identified that districts with reputable schools have higher property value compared with other districts. Hui et al.

The earliest work was carried out by Ridker and Henning (1967) to study the relation between indoor air quality (IAQ) and property prices in the St. Louis metropolitan area. They concluded that air pollution was a relatively significant factor in explaining residential property values. Harrison and Rubinfeld (1978) later estimated the marginal value of clean air for property prices in the Boston metropolitan area. It was found that the value of clean air was positive and the effect was positively correlated to household income. With regard to the effect of indoor particulate matter on property prices, Diamond (1980) and Li and Brown (1980) found a significantly negative effect. Chattopadhyay (1999) pointed out that residents in Chicago were willing to pay more for reducing exposure to pollution caused by air particulate (PM10) and sulfur dioxide. A regression analysis by Kim et al. (2003) also showed that the marginal WTP for a 4% air quality improvement was about 1.4% of the mean house value. To conclude, people prefer a place with better IAQ despite a higher cost.",

Chao, Tung, and Burnett (1997) studied the influence of different ventilation rates on indoor radon levels at 12 residential sites in Hong Kong. It was reported that the ratio of indoor to outdoor radon level was 46.5 when the ventilation rate was around 0.2 air changes per hour (ACH). However, when the ventilation rate was increased to higher than 3 ACH, the indoor radon level was close to the outdoor radon level. Murakami, Kato, Ooka, and Shiraishi (2004) studied two residential building models with and without voids in buildings. The results indicated that the model with voids improves natural ventilation effectively and thus saves 2.8% of energy used for air-conditioning compared with the model without natural ventilation. Given the positive contribution of natural ventilation to energy usage and IAQ, better natural ventilation undoubtedly has an impact on the property value.",

The higher the traffic noise, the lower will be the property value. Nelson (1982) studied the impact of traffic noise by hedonic price method. The result was represented by a noise sensitivity depreciation index (NSDI) that relates the percentage depreciation in property price induced by each decibel (dB(A)) of noise above a threshold level. It was found that a house with a background noise level of 75 dB(A) was valued 8% less than a house with a noise level of 55 dB(A) and thus the corresponding NSDI was 0.4%. Wilhelmsson (2000) conducted a detailed study on the correlation between traffic noise and the value of single-family houses in Sweden. His empirical analysis found an average drop of 0.6% in property price for each increase in dB(A) or a total discount of 30% in price for a house in a noisy location compared to a house in a quiet zone.",

The small variation in price indices in 2003 could be explained by the occurrence of SARS during which the property market was seriously affected. Besides the substantial drop in price indices, the impact was also reflected in the drop in number of sale and purchase agreements, which was 71,576 in 2003 as opposed to 103,362 in 2005 (Land Registry, 2010). Accordingly, transaction records of 2005 were used for price analysis in this study.",

The big difference (2.4\u20137.9 times) is consistent with the earlier discussions (Section 2) that the environmental attributes are often perceived as affecting people's well-being and health condition, which are issues that deserve a higher value; as opposed to better architectural conditions which are only something nice to have.",

The independent variables include two parameters for reflecting the architectural characteristics of a residential unit, floor area (FLA) and orientation of the living room windows (ORI). While the other three independent variables are the simple indicators identified to represent the environmental characteristics of residential units. They are the distance from road (LogR), mean angle of unobstructed sky (\u03b8\u00af) and existence of cross ventilation (VENT).",
