The plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3), and the transformed cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C in LB media containing 100 mg/L ampicillin. After the OD600 reached 0.8, the culture was cooled to 16 \u00b0C and supplemented with 0.5 mM IPTG. After overnight induction, the cells were harvested through centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol) and homogenized with an ultra-high-pressure cell disrupter at 4 \u00b0C. The insoluble material was removed through centrifugation at 12,000 rpm. The fusion protein was first purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and then further purified by passage through a Hitrap Q ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare, USA) before loading onto a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl and 4 mM MgCl2. Purified nsp12 was concentrated to 4 mg/mL and stored at 4 \u00b0C. Full-length COVID-19 virus nsp7 and nsp8 were co-expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells as a no-tagged protein and a 6 \u00d7 His-SUMO fusion protein, respectively. After purification by Ni-NTA (Novagen) affinity chromatography, the nsp7-nsp8 complex was eluted through on-column tag cleavage by ULP protease. The eluate was further purified by Hitrap Q ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare, USA) and a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl and 4 mM MgCl2. For assembling stable nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex, purified nsp12 was incubated with nsp7 and nsp8 at 4 \u2103 for three hours, at a molar ratio of 1: 2: 2 in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl and 4 mM MgCl2. For the sample in reduced condition, the complex was further transferred to a reducing buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 250 mM NaCl and 4 mM MgCl2, 4 mM DTT using a centrifugal ultrafiltration device (Amicon\u00ae Ultra Filters).",

The grid was then blotted for 3.0 s with a blot force of 0 at 8\u00b0C and 100% humidity and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Cryo-EM data were collected with a 300 keV Titan Krios electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and a K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan, USA). Images were recorded at EFTEM with a 165000\u00d7 magnification and calibrated super-resolution pixel size 0.82 \u00c5/pixel. The exposure time was set to 5 s with a total accumulated dose of 60 electrons per \u00c5 2 . All images were automatically recorded using SerialEM (18) .

The following 2D, 3D classifications and refinements were all performed in cryoSPARC. 918,133 particles were selected after two rounds of 2D classification. 100,000 particles were used to do Ab-Initio reconstruction in five classes, and then these five classes were used as 3D volume templates for heterogeneous refinement with all selected particles, with 110,176 particles converged into one class. Next, this particle set was used to perform homogeneous refinement, yielding a resolution of 3.1 \u00c5. After local refinement, the final resolution reached 2.9 \u00c5. For Dataset-2, the image processing was conducted using a similar pipeline. 753,481 particles were auto-picked initially, and 145,388 particles were selected after final heterogeneous refinement.
