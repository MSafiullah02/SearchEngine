            "text": "Emerging infectious diseases are caused by pathogens that are newly recognized or whose incidence has either increased in the preceding 2 decades or threatens to increase. Viral diseases account for a large proportion of such infections. In the context of transplant recipients, important emerging viruses can be considered to be 1 of 3 types: (1) novel viruses; (2) known viruses increasing in incidence in the general population and, potentially, in transplant recipients; and (3) previously known viruses that cause disease of increased severity in the immunocompromised host. In this review, we begin by discussing viral diagnostics and the evolving field of viral discovery, which has increased the speed of virus identification but has created new challenges. Our focus then shifts to specific emerging and reemerging viral pathogens in the transplant community. Viruses described in case series or multiple case reports are listed in Table 1. Viruses described only in single case reports are listed in Table 2. The potential risks of viral transmission as the result of xenotransplantation will not be addressed [1].\n",

            "text": "Viral discovery has typically relied on the ability to detect new viruses in cell culture. Although clinical virology laboratories affiliated with transplant centers routinely perform viral culture, many pathogens do not grow well or do not grow at all, and viral detection using culture is further limited by the number of cell lines a laboratory can realistically maintain. Pathogen detection in the clinical laboratory is also limited by the available tests, which often target conserved sequences (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or real-time [RT]\u2013PCR) or specific antigens or antibodies to detect known viruses. Multiplex testing for clinical syndromes, particularly for respiratory-tract infections, allows for a less biased approach to viral diagnosis but still faces limitations in identifying emerging pathogens [2]. In rare situations, an unusual virus may be detected by testing for known pathogens, as in the case of a woman who presented with Usutu viremia, which gave a low-positive result by West Nile virus RT-PCR [3].",

The pan-viral microarray is an array spotted with oligonucleotide sequences representing known viral pathogens. Novel viruses can be identified if sufficient similarity exists between sequences in the new virus and those on the array. Amplicons can then be recovered from the array, then cloned and sequenced [5]. This technology was used in the identification of SARS coronavirus from a cultured patient isolate [4]. PCR based on conserved sequences generally has limited applicability in viral diagnostics, as viruses do not contain highly conserved sequences analogous to 16S ribosomal RNA sequences utilized in bacterial identification [6].",

Sequence-independent approaches include subtractive hybridization or representation difference analysis, sequence-independent single-primer amplification, and rolling circle amplification. These techniques have been used to identify agents such as human herpes virus 8, torque teno viruses (TTV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), Norwalk virus, parvovirus 4, and human bocavirus (HBoV) [4, 7]. Viral metagenomics has been aided by the development of a number of new sequencing platforms. Termed next-generation sequencing (NGS, or deep-sequencing), such technologies allow for the rapid and parallel generation of 106 to over 109 sequences per run. Most current technologies rely on nonspecific amplification of viral DNA or RNA from samples treated to remove host nucleic acids. Amplification is followed by sequencing by synthesis using different technologies to detect base incorporation [6\u20138]. NGS has been utilized to identify novel viruses in patient samples and in studies of fevers of unknown origin [9, 10].",

For many of these viruses, classical Koch's postulates cannot be applied, and as demonstrated with TTV and HBoV, establishing a causative role for these agents can be difficult [6, 11, 12]. Mokili and colleagues [6] proposed \u201cMetagenomic Koch's Postulates,\u201d but whether they are sufficient remains moot. At this time, NGS is largely a tool for research purposes. Sequencing reactions take a good deal of time to set up and perform [8]. These runs generate massive amounts of data that must be filtered prior to analysis using various alignment programs designed to handle the large numbers of short reads [8, 9]. Finally, results must be interpreted carefully. Contaminants from the laboratory and even from commercial reagents are often identified (eg, xenotropic murine leukemia virus\u2013related virus), and confirming the presence of a virus identified with small numbers of reads may not be possible [9, 13].",

(HSCT will be used to describe the transplantation of multipotent stem cells from bone marrow, peripheral, or cord blood.) The largest study of HSCT for ATL involved the retrospective analysis of 386 patients with ATL who had undergone an allogeneic HSCT at 3 centers in Japan [23]. Their 3-year survival rate was 33%; ATL recurred in 41% of patients who survived to 30 days post transplant. Those who received transplants from a related HTLV-1 seropositive donor had a higher risk of disease-associated mortality relative to those whose related donor was HTLV-1 negative.

Infections in developed nations are well described, but typically result from the consumption of undercooked pork products. In immunocompetent hosts, HEV acute infection is self-limited with rare progression to fulminant liver failure. However, in the immunosuppressed host, chronic infection marked by persistent viremia and abnormal liver function with eventual progression to cirrhosis can occur [26\u201328]. Cases have been described in recipients of a variety of transplants, including kidney, liver, heart, and lung [27, 28]. In a multicenter review of 85 cases of acute HEV infection, 65.9% of the solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients developed chronic hepatitis of whom 14.3% developed cirrhosis. The use of tacrolimus compared with cyclosporine A was an independent predictor of chronic infection [28]. Rare cases of encephalitis and polyradiculopathy with HEV RNA detection in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have also been described [26].",

Studies evaluating HBoV as a respiratory pathogen in immunocompromised adults have detected the virus infrequently and have not documented an effect on patient outcomes [2, 12]. The establishment of HBoV as a respiratory pathogen has also been complicated by high rates of copathogen detection and HBoV detection in asymptomatic patients [2, 12]. Viral dissemination in transplant recipients occurs, with HBoV detected in blood and stool. However, patients often had HBoV detected after weeks of hospitalization, and other pathogens were also detected during these episodes [36, 37].

The most significant manifestation may be subacute measles encephalitis (SME), though severe cases of pneumonia have been documented [2]. SME has developed in renal transplant recipients and a single HSCT recipient. Patients may present with a measles-compatible illness, which improves. They develop altered mental status and seizures 2\u20134 weeks later; fever is uncommon. The first imaging changes are seen by magnetic resonance imaging, and diagnosis is confirmed by immunoglobin M (IgM) seroconversion or RT-PCR. The clinical course is one of deteriorating mental status and treatment-refractory seizures [2]. Four of 6 transplant cases of SME have died. The 2 survivors both had significant neurological deficits [41]. The incidence of measles in transplant recipients, as well as the proportion with severe disease, is unclear. Two series identified 2 cases of interstitial pneumonia (1 fatal) among 24 HSCT recipients diagnosed with measles, though methodological limitations existed in both studies [2].",

The examples of HTLV-1 (discussed earlier) and LCMV are illustrative of some of the difficulties involved with donor screening. In the outbreak investigations for LCMV, only 1 of 4 donors had detectable antibodies. Indeed, RT-PCR from multiple samples failed to detect LCMV from 1 donor, and yielded a positive result in only a single lymph node in another [49\u201351]. It seems prudent to obtain a comprehensive history of potential organ donors, though it remains unclear how certain findings, such as rodent ownership, should affect one's donor status. Reporting rare infections in transplant recipients will help to identify agents for which more research is needed and screening may be warranted. However, it is likely that these infections are underdiagnosed as symptoms may be attributed to more common, and potentially coincident, posttransplant infections.",
