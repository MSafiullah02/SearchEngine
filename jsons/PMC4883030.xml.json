Although it is unclear how human coronaviruses spread, it is believed that they are transmitted by air via the coughing and sneezing of an infected person, or via close personal contact such as by touching or shaking hands with an infected person [\n2\n]. These viruses may also spread when people touch contaminated objects or surfaces and then their mouth, nose or eyes [\n2\n]. By May 2014, the total number of cases of MERS-CoV reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) was 632including 193 deaths [\n2\n]; most of these cases were in the Middle East [\n3\n]. Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of cases, followed by the United Arab Emirates [\n3\n]. Confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been reported in the following countries: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, Oman, Kuwait, Egypt, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Greece, Tunisia, Malaysia, the Philippines and the United States [\n3\n].\n",

Despite efforts to raise community awareness of the virus, to promote behavioral practices to limit its spread, the MOH has reported a positive correlation (14.5%) between MERS-CoV infection (52 of 358) and direct contact with infected family members during the period from May 2013 to May 2014 [\n4\n]. Based on this correlation, it is clear that people in Saudi Arabia still lack the necessary awareness regarding the virus\u2019s mode of transmission, and available protective measures to limit exposure. Over the past 10 years, the Saudi community has depended on the internet as its main source of information for causes and modes of transmission of disease. Consequently, information distributed on the internet by non-specialists, which has not been subject to careful scientific scrutiny or recognized by the medical community, may have contributed to ineffective practices and approaches to disease prevention in Saudi Arabia, as well as adversely influencing individuals\u2019 attitudes to prevention strategies. Indeed, in one survey that measured awareness, attitudes and practices related to swine influenza, more than 38.3% of the responders were unconvinced that the reports from the Saudi MOH about the severity of disease were true, which may explain an apathy among people in Saudi Arabia to engage with disease management interventions conceived by the Saudi MOH, aimed at minimizing viral transmission [\n6\n]. To promote greater awareness among the Saudi population, further research to develop more effective and engaging methods for communicating critical information on prevention strategies is needed, to limit the spread of MERS-CoV.\n",

The purpose of this descriptive study was to identify effective characteristics, for the model input variables, that would support an effective campaign, in a sample representative of the Saudi population. Key to the development of an effective campaign to increase disease awareness and promote behavioral changes is the identification of information-seeking behaviors; for example, the particular source and choice of channel/media may influence receptivity to, and impact of, the messages. Thus, receiver variables relating to information-seeking behaviors were studied to determine whether campaign efforts should differ as a function of these characteristics.",

Approximately 30% of the individuals did not provide an estimate of the disease\u2019s fatality rate because they were unable to; however, 27.7% estimated fatality rate following infection within the range of 25\u201350% (actual reported range). Among the participants, 98.2% confirmed that they had access to the internet from home, and 86.3% were able to access the internet from other locations. For receiver characteristics, few statistically significant differences were detected between males and females; in particular, Significantly more females had a college degree (\u03c7\n2\n= 91.9,\nP\n< 0.001), aware that the infection is caused by a virus (\u03c7\n2\n= 10.1,\nP\n= 0.002), worried about becoming infected (\u03c7\n2\n= 16.0,\nP\n= 0.001) and reported a fatality rate within the range of 25\u201350% (as reported in the literature-males reported a fatality rate within a lower range) (\u03c7\n2\n= 30.2,\nP\n< 0.001). In addition, differences were detected for some variables across age groups, with participants who were aged <30 years being more likely to report higher fatality rates (\u03c7\n2\n= 28.2,\nP\n= 0.005), to have greater awareness of the transmission modes (\u03c7\n2\n= 19.2,\nP\n= 0.001) and to be less worried about contracting the disease (\u03c7\n2\n= 31.9,\nP\n= 0.001). Participants who reported that they were aware of the Corona virus were more likely to be unemployed (mostly women) or employed in the health care sector (\u03c7\n2\n= 90.3,\nP\n< 0.001), and to have received education up to high school level or above (\u03c7\n2\n= 172.5,\nP\n< 0.001). Having a friend or relative that had been infected with MERS-CoV were found according to participants\u2019 region of residence (\u03c7\n2\n= 119.3,\nP\n< 0.001); these reports were mainly from participants from northern and eastern Riyadh.

Such low levels of worry may be associated with poor prevention behavior, and other harmful or reckless behaviors commonly found in younger age groups [\n12\n] (which may also increase vulnerability to other diseases). In general, our survey data indicate room for improvement in awareness of transmission modes, protective behaviors and seriousness of disease knowledge of MERS-CoV. To be effective, an awareness campaign needs to promote basic education about transmission modes; otherwise its messages could be perceived as selective, e.g. in highlighting risks and a particular need for preventative behaviors in vulnerable individuals or those more likely to be exposed to the virus. The Saudi MOH has reported a positive correlation of MERS-CoV cases and contact with other infected family members [\n4\n].
