In vitro studies have suggested that Hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with Azithromycin could be a viable therapy 1\n,\n2. A small, controversial study enrolling 26 treated patients and 16 non-randomized controls showed that HY/AZ shortened the viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 3. Based on this, clinicians in many countries have begun using these medications, and multiple randomized trials are ongoing 4. However, HY and AZ have each been independently shown to increase the risk for QT interval prolongation, drug-induced torsade de pointes (TdP), and sudden cardiac death (SCD) 5, 6, 7, 8. We recently reported QT prolongation in a preliminary series of 84 patients with COVID-19 treated with HY/AZ 9. Here we report a study from two centers evaluating the effects of HY/AZ on the QT interval and the arrhythmic risk in patients with COVID-19.",

Continuous variables are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, and categorical variables are expressed as percentages (95% confidence interval). Normality of data samples was assessed using Shapiro-Wilk test. Two sample hypothesis testing for continuous variables was performed using Student\u2019s t-test if samples had normal distributions, Mann-Whitney U test if samples did not have normal distributions, or paired samples t-test for paired samples. Two sample hypothesis testing for categorical variables was performed using Fisher\u2019s exact test. For Figure 2A, a mixed-effects analysis with Geisser-Greenhouse correction was performed, followed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test to compare each day\u2019s QTc to the baseline QTc. For Figure 2B, one sample t-test (if samples were normally distributed) or one sample Wilcoxon signed rank test (if samples were not normally distributed) was performed to compare each sample against a delta QTc of 0 ms (i.e. no change from baseline), and p values were adjusted using the Holm-Bonferroni method to \u03b1 < 0.05. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify predictors of prolonged JTc, delta QTc, and QTc. The univariate predictors with p < 0.05 and greatest clinical utility were selected for subsequent multivariate analysis, as allowed by our sample size.",

The median age was 64\u00b113 years and 75% were male. Forty four (17.5%) patients died of respiratory or multi-organ failure. One patient with extreme QTc prolongation developed TdP and required emergent cardioversion (Figure 1\n), representing an arrhythmic risk of 0.4%. QTc interval prolonged from a baseline of 439 \u00b1 29 ms to a maximal value of 473 \u00b1 36 ms (p<0.001) which occurred on day 4.1 \u00b1 2 of therapy) in the general cohort (Figure 2\n). JTc prolonged from a baseline of 342\u00b125 ms to a maximal value of 375\u00b135 ms which occurred on day 4.1\u00b11.9. For patients with QRS < 120 ms, QTc prolonged from a baseline of 434 \u00b1 25 to a maximum of 469 \u00b1 34 ms, which occurred on day 4 \u00b1 1.9. The individual change between baseline and maximal QTc is presented in figure 3\n. Figure 4\nrepresents the distribution of QTc ranges at each day. Of note, In 58 of 251 (23%) patients, at least one measure of extreme QTc prolongation was observed. Specifically, QTc>500 msec was seen in 28 of 222 (13%) patients with QRS<120. JTc>410 was seen in 4 of 29 (14%) patients with QRS >120, and \u0394QTc>60 was seen in 51 of 251 (20%) patients with any QRS. These numbers include 25 patients who had more than one of these endpoints. Thirty five (60%) of the 58 patients who met the composite endpoint were not on any other QTc prolonging medication. In this high risk group, QTc increased from a baseline of 431 \u00b1 32 to 513 \u00b1 38 ms and JTc increased from 335\u00b128 to 417\u00b1 ms (p<0.01 for both). In 8 patients, extreme QTc prolongation triggered discontinuation of therapy prematurely, including the patient who developed TdP where therapy was halted on day 4. In 29 (11.5%) patients, baseline QRS was more than 120 ms. The baseline JTc and the maximal \u0394JTc were similar between patients with and without QRS>120 (Table 2\n). On multivariate analysis, baseline QTc and co-administration of Amiodarone were significant predictors of QTc > 500 ms, while baseline Creatinine and co-administration of Amiodarone were predictors of \u0394QTc > 60 ms (Tables 3 and 4\n). The predictors of extreme JTc prolongation > 410 ms included baseline JTc and Creatinine (Supplementary Table 1). Patients with extreme QTc prolongation had lower body weight, greater frequency of kidney disease, and greater Amiodarone exposure (Supplementary Table 2).",

            "text": "Drug-induced QT prolongation is an important substrate for TdP, a potentially lethal polymorphic VT. In our study of 251 patients with COVID-19, we found high incidence of QTc prolongation, with at least one documented polymorphic VT (suspected TdP) for a rate of 0.4%. To put the incidence of TdP in perspective, the risk of TdP induction by Sotalol is estimated at 0.1% 16. Due to this risk, Sotalol is introduced under ECG monitoring in the hospital for at least 3 days. In our study, we observed QTc prolongation in parallel with increasing HY/AZ exposure, which partially shortened after medication cessation. For example, the proportion of patients with QTc > 500 ms was 20% at day 4 after completion of HY/AZ therapy and declined to 10% one day later. Baseline QTc/JTc, Creatinine level and co-administration of Amiodarone were significant predictors of extreme QTc/JTc prolongation and \u0394QTc > 60 ms. We show that the effect on the QTc was driven entirely by prolonging the repolarization and regardless of QRS, as evident by the corresponding JTc prolongation. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that there is limited data regarding high arrhythmic risk markers in patients with QRS >120 ms and QTC prolongation. We utilized QTc change by > 60 ms as a marker, a cutoff that was initially proposed in an algorithm designed to automatically detect QTc prolongation taking into account the normal variation in QTc 17. In addition we utilized a cutoff of JTc>410 ms as the correlate of QTc>500 ms for patients with wide QRS, based on the deduction of the mean QRS value we found in our patients with normal QRS, which was 90 ms. Previous information on the potential proarrhythmic effect of the combination Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin is limited. In a randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial in 116 young healthy controls receiving Chloroquine alone or in combination with Azithromycin, co-administration increased the QTc interval (Fridericia) by up to 14 ms 18\n,\n19. However, the risk for drug induced TdP is substantially higher in hospitalized patients. This, is due to greater prevalence of other risk factors for TdP, including older age, presence of underlying heart disease, genetic factors 20, electrolyte disturbances and co-treatment with other QT prolonging medications 21, 22, 23, 24. Indeed, in a recent study assessing Chloroquine therapy in COVID-19 patients, extreme QT prolongation and excess cardiac mortality in the higher dose arm led to premature interruption of the regimen 25. Concordantly, recently published studies confirmed a QT prolonging effect of HY/AZ ranging between 23 to 41 ms (Supplementary Table 3). In the current study, we found a significant proportion of patients with extreme QTc prolongation, 23%, with at least one polymorphic VT requiring cardioversion. Another 7 patients who developed extreme QTc prolongation by day 3 had the treatment stopped, possibly preventing additional arrhythmic events. Interestingly, the coupling interval of the arrhythmia initiating beat observed in our study was \u223c380 ms, which is shorter than expected for TdP 26. In this regard, Azithromycin has been shown to induce short-coupled polymorphic VT regardless of QT prolongation 27. It is thus impossible to be certain about the nature of the arrhythmia. Since this polymorphic VT took place at the time of significant QT prolongation, it is reasonable to assume that HY/AZ played an important pro-arrhythmic role. However, in view of its relatively short coupling interval, it is not clear if this is true TdP or a polymorphic VT triggered by Azithromycin via increased sodium current. The alarming proportion of COVID-19 patients developing extreme QT prolongation with HY/AZ therapy in our study can be explained by the specific characteristics of this population, which includes older age, greater prevalence of underlying and acute renal failure and co-administration of additional QT prolonging medications, particularly Amiodarone.",

            "text": "Recently published guidance statements addressing QTc surveillance and arrhythmic risk in COVID-19 patients are based on LQTS risk stratification principals and include pretreatment assessment of the QTc, considering stopping other QTc prolonging medications, and providing special attention to those with highest risk features 15\n,\n28\n,\n29. Yet, our findings suggest that risk stratification of patients with COVID19 may be more complex. For example, we found that the baseline QTc in patients with extreme QTc prolongation was only 431 \u00b1 32 ms, within the \u201cnormal\u201d QTc range. Moreover, 42 (72%) of the 58 patients in the high risk group had a baseline QTc <450 and JTc < 350 ms. Additionally, it is important to consider that even careful monitoring of the QT interval may only partially mitigate the risk for TdP. This is because arrhythmia often occurs in the setting of sudden, intermittent changes in the R-R interval, such as when PVCs, APCs or pauses occur. In these cases, TdP can present even if the QTc in only mildly prolonged at baseline 30. We therefore suggest that individual risk/benefit assessment should be applied before treating with HY/AZ. We recommend daily ECG monitoring, with reassessment of the therapy if high risk markers appear (QTc >500 ms or \u0394QTc > 60 ms). For this, triggered alerting systems may be applied 31. Finally, we observed only partial resolution of the QTc at 3 days after completion of therapy. This may be attributed to the prolonged half-life of Hydroxychloroquine, which is approximately 20 days. This finding requires special attention when considering discharging patients receiving HY/AZ or if outpatient treatment with HY/AZ is planned.",
