This can possibly be explained as poultry meat and eggs represent an efficient source of protein and have low cost of production in comparison with other sources of protein, such as pork and beef (Service, 2013). Nowadays almost every world region (Africa, North and Central America, South America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania) has to improve their production systems to accomplish the global demand of richer and more nutritional diets. Besides, global trading of poultry products has also increased, especially between the major producers (i.e., the United States, Brazil, and China) and the rest of the world (Stenhouse, 2008).",

This approach allows assessing all possible etiological agents and associated risk factors, selecting the most adequate laboratory tests to determine the cause of the disease. It is also important to take the intrinsic factors (such as species, breed or strain, immune status, and age of bird) into consideration that can determine the presence of a disease (Sjaak de Wit, 2008).",

Biosecurity involves measures at the level of environmental control and management, including elaboration of vaccination and medication programs and also application of effective cleansers, sanitizer, and disinfectants. These biosecurity measures are essential to control the diseases and reduce their economic and public health significance (Lister, 2008).",

The former contains 6 subspecies that are also classified in serovars according to the antigenic specificity. In the veterinary field, the most important serovars are: Salmonella pullorum (pullorum disease), Salmonella gallinarum (fowl typhoid), S. enterica subsp. arizonae (Arizonosis), and other salmonella infection-causing serovars (Salmonellosis, paratyphoid infection) (Lister et al., 2008).\u2022Pullorum disease: Almost all species of birds can get infected with S. pullorum, but only chickens, turkeys, guinea fowl, quail, and pheasant show clinical disease. Clinical signs are usually observed in birds less than 3 weeks of age, which are found dead in shell or die quickly after hatching, due to peritonitis and septicemia (Shivaprasad, 2013b).\u2022Fowl typhoid (Salmonella gallinarum infection): S. gallinarum causes disease mainly in adult or growing chickens and turkeys but also affects ducks, pheasants, guinea fowl, peafowl, grouse, and quail. Acute cases of infection are related to septicemia. In subacute outbreaks, there are dead-in-shell embryos, or dead chicks on the hatching trays. Chronically affected birds show anemia and focal necrosis in the liver (Figure 2\n), heart, intestines, and pancreas (Lister et al., 2008).\u2022Salmonellosis, paratyphoid infection: Within this group are included Salmonella serovars associated with foodborne human disease. This group includes Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium. Members of this group are found in a wide range of species (birds, mammals, reptiles, fish, and insects). Paratyphoid S. enterica produces typhlitis in young birds with dissemination toward the spleen, lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys (Gast, 2013).\u2022Arizonosis (S. enterica subsp. arizonae): Arizonae infection affects avian, mammal, and reptilian species. Avian arizonosis is recognized mainly in turkeys but also is found in chickens and ducks. Clinical signs are similar to the observed in cases of salmonellosis, but additionally the arizonosis is characterized by the induction retinitis and encephalitis (Shivaprasad, 2013a).\n",

Organophosphorus (OPs) insecticides have a cholinesterase-inhibiting action and some of them are specifically toxic to birds. OPs compounds, such as diazinon, fenthion, and parathion, cause locomotor and respiratory muscular weakness, dyspnea, and paralysis. Carbamate anticholinesterase insecticides (bofuran, methomyl, and bendiocarb) produce similar clinical signs to the OPs, but it is more acute with marked tremors and convulsions. Finally, another insecticide widely used is the pyrethroid (permethrin, cypermethrin, and deltamethrin); however, they are very secure and only rarely cause toxicity. Clinical signs of hyperactivity, tremor, and salivation are observed in the affected birds.",
