From January 2007 to December 2016, respiratory specimens from 23 694 hospitalized patients with acute respiratory illness were tested by molecular assays for respiratory viral pathogens at the Chung-Ang University Hospital. Among the patients, 21 184 were children (aged <18 years) and 2510 were adults. Respiratory samples were tested for hMPV and other respiratory viral pathogens using Seeplex RV6 or Anyplex II RV16 Detection kits (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea). Specimens were nasal swabs (n = 17 414 [73.5%]), throat swabs (n = 4340 [18.3%]), nasal aspirate (n = 1716 [7.3%]), sputum (n = 145 [0.6%]), and bronchial washing (n = 79 [0.3%]). Seeplex can detect 6 common respiratory viruses including adenovirus, influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), and hMPV. With Anyplex, 16 respiratory viruses can be detected and these include adenovirus, influenza A and B, PIV types 1, 2, 3, and 4, rhinovirus A/B/C, RSV A and B, bocavirus, hMPV, enterovirus, and coronavirus 229E, NL63, and OC43. Seeplex was used for routine molecular analysis until December 2012, and Anyplex was employed thereafter.",

The Fisher exact test was used to compare differences between binomial variables. Continuous variables were compared by the Kruskal-Wallis test, and post hoc tests were performed using the Dunn multiple comparisons test. Associations between hMPV-positive rates and climate factors were explored by univariate regression analysis based on the Pearson correlation coefficient. Independent associations were analyzed by the multiple linear regression model using the stepwise selection method. A P value <.05 was considered a significant difference. We also utilized principal components analysis (PCA) to determine the contribution of climate variables to hMPV infections. Using PCA, we could reduce high-dimensional data spaces (1 axis per meteorological variable) to 2-dimensional planes for further analysis [16, 17]. Based on the results of PCA, we could select dominant climate factors that affect hMPV infections, and 2-dimensional density plots were generated to evaluate the impact of climate factors in hMPV infections.",

This circulation complexity was also found in long-term studies from the United States and Germany [11, 20]. In addition, we could not find any similarities in annual predominance patterns between our study and other studies conducted in neighboring counties including China and Japan [21\u201323]. These results suggest that the varying annual predominance of hMPV subtypes/genotypes is a local phenomenon, and not synchronized across a wide geographic region [11].",

However, there were also many reports suggesting that there are no differences in clinical characteristics caused by various hMPV subtypes [9, 10, 21]. In our study, according to hMPV subtypes, statistical significance was found in terms of symptoms, physical examination findings, and concurrent infections in pediatric patients. However, we found that there were no distinct differences in clinical diagnoses, clinical outcomes, and laboratory findings according to hMPV genotypes. These results support the contentions that certain clinical manifestations are different among hMPV genotypes but that there is no significant relationship between the hMPV subtype and disease severity.",

Among these factors, the rate of hMPV positivity was positively correlated with 3 variables including diurnal temperature variation, wind speed, and sunshine duration. Our results also showed peaks of hMPV activity at temperatures of approximately 13.5\u00b0C and relative humidity of 55.0%; furthermore, this activity tended to be associated with increasing diurnal temperature variation, wind speed, and sunshine duration. Previous studies conducted in other regions suggested that low temperature is the main driver of hMPV seasonality [11, 24\u201326]. However, based on the results of our study, we could not conclude that temperature variables are not linearly correlated with hMPV epidemics. Because the climate of Seoul is characterized by large seasonal temperature differences, which are not observed in previously studied countries, we hypothesized that hMPV would not be prevalent at low temperatures but would be prevalent at a certain temperature interval. In addition, the amount of rainfall was found to be correlated with the incidence of hMPV infections in subtropical and tropical regions [27\u201329], whereas hMPV activity was not affected by rainfall in our study. These findings suggest that hMPV infections were affected by climate factors, but that the meteorological drivers of virus activity vary by region and climate group [11, 24].",

Second, the clinical information of hMPV-positive patients was only tracked by medical records due to the nature of our retrospective study. We admit that some information could be misrepresented or omitted, and this possibility could also affect the results of this study. Third, because respiratory molecular testing was routinely used only for pediatric patients, and not for adult patients, the study population was biased for pediatric patients and the number of adult patients was relatively insufficient.

Among the 5 subtypes of hMPV, hMPV A2a was most frequently isolated and each hMPV subtype showed annual predominance every 3\u20134 years. There were also significant differences between hMPV genotypes and clinical characteristics; however, disease severity was not altered according to hMPV subtype. Our study also showed that hMPV infections occurred with a seasonal rhythm and were associated with several climate factors including temperature, relative humidity, diurnal temperature variation, wind speed, and sunshine duration. In addition, each hMPV genotype had a different affinity for certain meteorological conditions. The results of our study contribute to the understanding of the clinical characteristics of infections caused by each hMPV subtype, as well as climate factors that contribute to the transmission of hMPV.",
