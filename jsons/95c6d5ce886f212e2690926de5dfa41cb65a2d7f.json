TRPV1 positive pathways are responsible for pain transmission, inflammation and immunomodulation throughout the entire pulmonary system. We suggest that therapeutic approaches targeting TRPV1 expressing neurons in the lungs will modulate the inflammatory and immune signal activity, leading to reduced mortality and better overall outcomes. We propose to further explore the use of resiniferatoxin (RTX), an ultra-potent TRPV1 agonist currently in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 clinical trials for cancer and osteoarthritis pain, as a possible ablating agent of TRPV1 positive pulmonary pathways in patients with advanced COVID-19 disease.",

These pulmonary changes are likely responsible for both systemic and localized immune response leading to a hyperinflammatory state. The mortality rate in patients is suspected to be related to virally driven cytokine storm similar to that seen in SARS-CoV-2 infections. The cytokine storm is a result of a severe immune reaction in the lungs as measured by high levels of inflammatory markers (c-reactive protein, serum ferritin) and cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1) in the plasma (1). ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1 as compared to non-ICU patients, suggesting that the presence of high circulating cytokine levels is associated with the severity of the disease (2, 5) . The current urgent need for effective treatment of this life-threatening disease by targeting hyper-inflammation in the lungs, is of high, compelling interest. Although use of corticosteroids might be beneficial in reducing inflammation-induced lung injury, evidence from SARS and MERS patients shows no or little improvement in mortality rates, with a delay in viral load clearance (6, 7) . An anti-inflammatory therapy using a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 is currently undergoing phase III trial in COVID-19 patients (8) and could lead to promising results.",

A practical approach for example, would be to access the vagal nerve with a local ablative agent might be through the neck, going low, away from the carotid bulb. The nerve location would then be confirmed using ultrasound guidance. We propose to pursue an epidural or peri-ganglionic application of RTX in patients with advanced COVID-19 disease in support of current palliative ventilation therapy, in the hope that ablating afferent nerves at the thoracic DRG level will increase survival of patients progressing towards critical condition. As we have product available, an active IND and have treated more about 30 patients through central routes without significant adverse events, we believe there is enough safety data to justify pursuing an IND for this indication. We also will propose to explore other alternative peripheral approaches (nerve blocks) in collaboration with experts and with the appropriate regulatory authority oversight.",

            "text": "DRG). Many of the neurons in these ganglia express high levels of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) ion channel. The crosstalk between TRPV1positive nerve fibers and immune cells is critical in mediating inflammation of the airway following exposure to either inhaled allergens or viral infection(13,14). TRPV1 is strongly implicated in the regulation of irritant-induced airway responses and cough (15). The expression of TRPV1 positive cells is increased in the airways of patients with chronic cough (18). Activation of TRPV1 enhances the release of several proinflammatory molecules, including substance P (sP), and cytokines such as IL-6. Proinflammatory substances have reported to be upregulated in COVID-19 cases and reflect the severity of the disease(16).A recent study has demonstrated that respiratory viral infections (by rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus or measles virus) can upregulate TRPV1 receptors by channel specific mechanisms (17). This upregulation can drive an inflammatory cascade in the lungs leading to airway hyperactivity and is dependent on the viral load and duration of infection. Interestingly, treatment with TRPV1 antagonist in this study significantly inhibited TRPV1 upregulation post viral infection. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 viruses with TRPV1 receptors has not yet been investigated but given the in sensitizing TRPV1 receptors resulting in hyper-inflamed lungs and associated complications. In accord with the aforementioned studies, Baral P. and colleagues demonstrated the role of sensory neurons expressing TRPV1 receptors in the lungs in a model of lethal MRSA pneumonia. These experiments showed that downregulation of the TRPV1 positive channels provided a protective pulmonary environment associated with neutrophil infiltration, enhanced T cell responses and bacterial clearance. Further, calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) released from the TRPV1 nerve endings during infection downregulates innate immune responses. Therefore, ablating TRPV1 positive cells and inhibiting CGRP release resulted in improved survival outcomes in MRSA infected mice, thus exposing TRPV1 as a potential therapeutic target in combating pneumonia and associated mortality (9). Secondary factors playing an aggravating role in the poor outcome of ventilated patients due to COVID-19 must also be considered. Critically ill patients suffering from ARDS are by-definition hypoxemic, which makes mechanical ventilation and oxygen-therapy a life-saving strategy. Unfortunately, both therapies represent a great challenge due to intrinsic complications. Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI) has been identified as a potential adverse effect of mechanical ventilation. Repetitive cyclic stretch and the resulting regional overdistention is associated with complications leading to pulmonary edema, barotrauma and further hypoxemia. These complications accelerate the deterioration of the pulmonary function. Michalick et. al. (10) demonstrated the role of TRPV1 as an amplifier of TRPV4-mediated response and lung epithelial barrier failurefor VILI. Using a knockout mice model, the authors observed that mechanical stress and TRPV1 positive cells amplified Ca+ signaling, and that inhibition of these receptors reduced the endothelial [Ca+] response to high pressure inflation.",

TRPV1 expression in the lungs is upregulated in the face of pathology (24) and can change as individuals age, switching from a mostly anti-inflammatory function in the young to a pro-inflammatory function in the elderly as shown in a systemic inflammatory animal model looking at that precise phenomena (20). The incidence of fatality associated with older patients, especially people over 65-years-old, might be exacerbated by the pro-inflammatory function of TRPV1 afferent nerves in the lungs.This in addition to a declining immune function in people as they get older making them more susceptive to infections, and the impact of higher comorbidities in the elderly",

Baral P and colleagues have further demonstrated that chemical ablation of pulmonary sensory neurons expressing TRPV1 receptors (by use of a highly potent TRPV1 agonist) dramatically improved survival against MRSA cytokine storm lethal pneumonia in a mouse model of the disease. In the experiments, they had no fatalities in the chemically-ablated neuron groups versus an 80% fatality in the untreated control group. Ablation of TRPV1 expressing neurons and the inhibition of associated CGRP release resulted in control of neurogenic inflammation and improved the overall survival outcome in the afferent pathways as part of the treatment for COVID-19-related pneumonia/ARDS will not only address the intrinsic pathophysiology of the viral infection and systemic inflammation, but should also help reduce the complications associated with the current gold-standard therapy (mechanical ventilation/oxygen therapy) in severely compromised patients.",

An ultra-potent agonist of the TRPV1 receptor, it works by inducing neurolysis of TRPV1-expressing neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), dorsal horns (DH) of the spinal cord, or peripheral nerve ending when applied locally as a nerve block. The strong binding of resiniferatoxin to TRPV1 receptors forces the opening of the channel gates leading to a slow and sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+, which in turn disrupts the intra-cellular mitochondrial metabolism and results in neural cell or nerve fiber deletion within minutes(25).Pharmacology safety studies indicate that the resiniferatoxin mechanism of action is limited to those nerves involved with neurogenic inflammation(26). Centraladministration of RTX causes permanent neurolysis via apoptosis in contrast to peripheral application which leads to a more transient effect because the peripheral nerve can regenerate. Ablation of the TRPV1 expressing complement of afferent nerves is not associated with effects on motor function or other adverse effects (27) and resiniferatoxin has shown positive impact on functional outcomes in multiple animal pain models. Multiple toxicology studies performed as IND enabling studies (to allow for human trials) confirm the applicability of resiniferatoxin as a central agent (intrathecal and epidural) or peripheral signal modulation agent (routes validated include intrathecal, epidural, intraarticular, peri-ganglionic, intra-vesicular and as a peripheral nerve block). Clinical trials currently being pursued for companion animal health have demonstrated the potential for effective application of RTX as an ablative agent utilized peripherally. been successfully administered to over 200 dogs in multiple studies looking at developing control of arthritis pain by ablating afferent nerve endings to the joints (28). Also, an exploratory clinical trial in 19 domestic felines demonstrated the drug ability to help control chronic neuropathic limb pain associated with declaw procedures (done years prior), when applied as a perineural nerve block to ablate afferent nerves at the carpal joint level (29).
