The structure of MRL was observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis confirmed the lipase conjugated to Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles. Optimized conditions for the process of biodiesel production by MRL were investigated by the response surface methodology (RSM) and the Box-Behnken design (BBD). The optimized conditions for biodiesel production by MRL were as follows. The molar ratio of methanol to oil was 4.0, water content was 1.5 % as oil weight, the dosage of MRL to oil was 9.0 % (W/W) under 41\u00b0C for 28 h. Under the optimized conditions, the yield of FAMEs by MRL reached 82.20 %. Further experiments showed that the MRL could be used 10 cycles and the yield of FAMEs decreased slightly by 10.97 %. These results indicated that Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticle carrier could efficiently improve the FAMEs synthesis and enhance the MRL stabilization and reusability in the biodiesel production.",

A lot of efforts have been made to reduce the cost of this procedure. Some researches focused on the low cost lipases with good transesterification performance though modification or immobilization lipases to improve the reusability and stability in biodiesel process. Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL), in modified and immobilized forms, has been more and more widely concerned [7] [8] [9] due to its relatively low cost and highly adaptable feedback (e.g. waste oil with high water concentration). Other researches concentrated on the optimized conditions to improve the transesterification efficiency [10] [11] [12] . Main factors affecting biodiesel process (reaction time, reaction temperature, methanol/oil molar ratio, type and concentration of biocatalyst as well as water content) were observed and optimized by analyzing their interactions. The current studies usually emphasized on either the lowcost lipase preparation or the biodiesel process optimization and few studies involve both of them. However, both sides are equally crucial to accelerate biodiesel industrial by biocatalysts.",

The Fe 3 O 4 \u2212COOH nanoparticles with a regular assemblage shape were observed in Fig. 2 A and the particle size of Fe 3 O 4 \u2212COOH nanoparticles was 17.7 nm, which closely matched the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis [15] . Fig. 2 B demonstrates the 2D profile and 3D topography of native TLL; the size of native TLL was 21.6 nm, which was nearly the same as the reported molecular dimension of TLL [22] . Compared with the regular assemblage shape of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles and native TLL particles, the MRL demonstrated different surface appearance in Fig. 2 C. The root mean square roughness value of the MRL was estimated to be 8.29 nm, which is between the value of native TLL particles (1.06 nm) and Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles (16.2 nm). Those changes indicated that the MRL was successfully formed, furthermore the structure of MRL was speculated in Fig. 2 D. Fig. 3 A shows the FTIR spectra of the Fe 3 O 4 \u2212COOH nanoparticles, native TLL and MRL.

In order to testify the interaction between Fe 3 O 4 \u2212COOH nanoparticle and TLL not a simple physical adsorption, the secondary structures of TLL and MRL were analyzed through the absorbance signals of the amide I region in the range of 1600\u22121700 cm \u22121 which were ascribed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of the C]O, CeN and NeH group in the backbone peptide bonds in proteins [17, 18, 23] . Fig. 3 also shows the derivative spectra of native TLL (Fig. 3 B) and MRL (Fig. 3 C) . The curve fitting analysis demonstrated that the amide I region composed by major peaks that were assigned to individual structural components according to literature [24, 25] . With the help of PeakFit, quantitative evaluation of the secondary structures was performed assuming a Gaussian peak shape. The secondary structural contents of them are given in Table 2 . Compared with native TLL, the increase of the contents of unordered structure may be associated to the interaction between the nanoparticles and TLL. Meanwhile, the MRL appeared an increase in \u03b1helix and a decrease in \u03b2-sheet content. The changes could be attributed to a more rigid structure so that the lipase tends to adapt a broader temperature and pH environment. Moreover, the increase in \u03b1-helix was responsible for the improvement of the enzyme activity as described in the Section 3.1. The results agreed well with literature that the higher catalytic efficiency related with the increase of \u03b1-helix content [26, 27] .",

Four linear terms (X 1 , X 2 , X 3 and X 5 ), six cross products (X 1 X 2 , X 2 X 3 , X 2 X 4 , X 3 X 4 , X 3 X 5 and X 4 X 5 ), and the five quadratic terms (X 1 2 , X 2 2 , X 3 2 , X 4 2 and X 5 2 ) were all remarkably significant model terms at 95 % confidence level. On the other hand, the independent variable of enzyme dosage (X 4 ) and the combined effects of reaction time and methanol/oil molar ratio (X 1 X 3 ), reaction time and enzyme dosage (X 1 X 4 ), reaction time and enzyme dosage (X 1 X 5 ), reaction temperature and enzyme dosage (X 2 X 5 ) had no significant effects on the biodiesel process. In general, higher F value and smaller P value indicate more significance of the corresponding coefficient [31, 32] . Based on the high F values and low corresponding P values in the Supplementary material (Table S2) , among the independent variables, methanol/oil molar ratio (X 3 ) was the most significant variable, then reaction temperature (X 2 ), water content (X 5 ) and reaction time (X 1 ) in the order. Among the interactions, combined effect of methanol/oil molar ratio and water content (X 3 X 5 ) had the greatest impact on the biodiesel production; then came reaction time and reaction temperature (X 1 X 2 ), reaction temperature and enzyme dosage (X 2 X 4 ), methanol/oil molar ratio and enzyme dosage (X 3 X 4 ), enzyme dosage and water content (X 4 X 5 ), reaction temperature and methanol/oil molar ratio (X 2 X 3 ). To graphically explain those main mutual interactions effected on the yield of FAMEs, the 3D response surface plots of them were presented in Fig. 4 (A-F) arranged from the most significant to the least. Fig. 4 A shows the most significant interactions between methanol/ oil molar ratio and water content, because these two factors related to the catalytic performance of enzyme, the transesterification efficiency and the occurring probability of hydrolysis as a competitive reaction. In a certain extent, the higher methanol/oil molar ratio could be more helpful in promoting the yield of FAMEs while the methanol could also result in loss or inactivation of the enzyme activity [33, 34] . For the multiple roles and strong influence of water in the reaction system, the activation of enzyme mainly embodied the conformational changes of the lipase molecules due to the exposing and restructuring of the catalytic active sites, which required the presence of oil-water interface [35, 36] . So the existence and a considerable concentration of water were in favor of the enzyme structural stabilization to enhance the transesterification efficiency but could accelerate the hydrolysis reaction and decrease the yield of FAMEs [37, 38] .",

To test the operation stability and reusability of the MRL in biodiesel process, batch transesterification of soybean oil was conducted by the addition of MRL. The reaction conditions were the optimal conditions mentioned in Table 5 . The MRL recovered with magnetic separation, washed sufficiently with phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 8.5) and dried as described in 2.2, then applied in the next batch with fresh substrates. As expected, the MRL embodied fine transesterification activity retention in repeated use in Fig. 5 . Under the optimal conditions, the yield of FAMEs was still up to 73.18 % and dropped only by 10.97 % after 10 cycles. The decrease of activity was probably caused by the loss of MRL during the magnetic recovery process (see the inset of Fig. 5) . However, the protein content of the MRL declined by only 17.91 %, for the reason that the occurrence of Fe 3 O 4 \u2212COOH nanoparticles anchored on the MRL and the mild separation method by a magnet, might help to enhance the tolerance to the organic solvent environment and relieve the loss of enzyme dosage.",

The temperatures of injector and detector were set at 280\u00b0C and 300\u00b0C respectively. The initial column temperature was kept at 150\u00b0C for 2 min then increased to 200\u00b0C at a rate of 5\u00b0C/min and kept 2 min; then increased to 240\u00b0C at a rate of 2\u00b0C/min and kept 3 min; finally increasing at 10\u00b0C/min up to 300\u00b0C and then maintained at 300\u00b0C for 10 min. The split ratio was 1:50 and the carrier gas was nitrogen. By comparing the retention times and peak areas of standard FAME peaks, the total quantity of FAMEs in the reaction mixture was calculated by the internal calibration method. The yield of FAMEs was defined as the mass ratio of FAMEs in the reaction mixture to the total theoretical amount of FAMEs measured by saponification of soybean oil as Eq. (2).",
