However, IMV management is particularly challenging in this population since deep sedation and a tight control of the arterial carbon dioxide and oxygen tension as well as the intrathoracic pressure are recommended to avoid unsuitable cerebral blood flow changes, particularly at an early stage [2\u20134]. Thereafter, pressure support ventilation (PSV) is the most widespread ventilatory mode used to lead the patients towards the withdrawal of IMV [5]. However, during PSV, the mismatch between patient demand and mechanical assistance has been frequently reported in terms of asynchrony events, with negative consequences on patient-ventilator interaction (PVI) [6, 7]. A poor PVI is associated with worse prognosis due to increased need for sedatives [8], prolongation of mechanical ventilation [6, 9], higher rate of tracheostomy [6], longer ICU and hospital stay [10], and increased mortality [11]. Accordingly, the loss of PVI could represent one reason of delayed withdrawal from IMV and/or extubation failure in neurocritical care patients too.",

            "text": "Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a ventilation mode in which the patient can assume the full control of ventilatory assistance in terms of timing and magnitude [12]. In general ICU patients, NAVA improves PVI during invasive and non-invasive ventilation respect to PSV [13\u201318]. This depends on several aspects: (1) contrarily to PSV where a pneumatic trigger is adopted, during NAVA the ventilator is triggered by patient\u2019s electrical activity of diaphragm (Eadi); (2) the ventilatory assistance is proportional to Eadi in NAVA, whereas in PSV the ventilatory support is fixed [12]. Thus, NAVA enhances the patient-ventilator synchrony, reduces the incidence of asynchronies, and improves the breath-by-breath variability of tidal volume (VT) compared to PSV [12], mimicking a more physiological behaviour [19]. Up to now, NAVA has never been applied to neurocritical care patients probably due to safety concerns on how the intracranial disease could affect Eadi signal, leading to unwanted modifications of arterial blood gases (ABGs) and cerebral blood flow velocity.",

The flow trigger was set as more sensible as possible, avoiding auto-triggers, and the expiratory cycle-off threshold was 30% of the peak inspiratory flow. Then, the corresponding level of assistance in NAVA was chosen through a specific ventilator tool (NAVA-preview, Getinge, Sweden) that, during PSV, matches the NAVA gain to get an equivalent peak of inspiratory pressure [14]. Afterwards, the ventilator was switched to PSV, and PSV1 setting parameters were restored (PSV2). PEEP and inspired oxygen fraction were maintained constant at the pre-enrolment values over the whole study duration. The level of sedation was assessed through Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale at study entry, immediately after the definitive catheter positioning, and held stable at each study step.

Simultaneously, across the temporal window, FVmean and pulsatility index (PI) of MCA were blindly assessed through a 2-MHz-TCCD machine (Xario 200, Toshiba Medical System, Japan) on each side, being MCA flow a rough representation of the ipsilateral hemisphere blood flow [21, 22]. During each assessment, after the MAC identification, the probe position was adjusted, by assuring an insonation angle < 30\u00b0 [23], to scan the blood flow velocity at 3 different sampling distances, approximatively: 60 mm, 45 mm, and 35 mm [22]. From the vessel segment showing the highest blood velocity, FVmean and PI were computed as the time-mean value of the velocity spectrum outline from 10 consecutive cardiac cycles [24]. ICP, cranial perfusion pressure (CPP), mean arterial pressure, and heart rate were monitored throughout the whole study duration and their average values were collected during the last minute of each trial and finally analysed.",

Paw and Eadi peak were measured. From flow trace mechanical respiratory rate, inspiratory and expiratory time, total breath duration, inspiratory duty cycle, and VT, by digital integration, were obtained [14]. Neural respiratory rate, inspiratory and expiratory time, total breath duration, inspiratory duty cycle were attained from Eadi waveform [14]. Inspiratory and expiratory trigger delay as well as time of synchrony, also indexed on neural inspiratory time and expressed in percentage, were calculated [13, 17]. The asynchrony index was computed as total amount of macroasynchrony events (ineffective efforts, double triggers, autotriggers and reverse triggers) on the sum of triggered and non-triggered breaths ratio and expressed in percentage [25]. An asynchrony index \u2265 10% was deemed suggestive for high rate of macroasynchrony [6]. Finally, the coefficient of variation for VT, mechanical respiratory rate, and Eadi and Paw peak were calculated (standard deviation to mean ratio multiplied by 100) as previously described [14].",

Here we show that both PSV and NAVA were securely applied in our setting, since FVmean, assessed at MCA on each side through TCCD sonography, was equally preserved by both ventilatory modes. This finding could be ascribed to three mechanisms; (1) the absence of pathological modifications of ICP during the entire study period, as also suggested by the fact that PI did not change over the trials [35]; (2) the lack of clinically relevant variations of cerebral and systemic haemodynamics, in agreement with the fact that CPP and mean arterial pressure did not change switching from PSV to NAVA; (3) the preservation of a physiological arterial carbon dioxide tension and ABGs overall, despite the mode of ventilation running. This aspect was particularly relevant, because it confirmed that the negative feedback loop of chemical control of respiration was preserved in our population. Indeed, we could speculate that the alveolar ventilation was similar among ventilation modes, as suggested by the absence of modifications of VT, mechanical respiratory rate, and arterial carbon dioxide tension among trials. In NAVA, this was the result of a higher respiratory centre output, as confirmed by a greater Eadi peak compared to that detected in PSV1 and PSV2, respectively. Thus, being the ventilatory support applied in proportion to Eadi [12], in NAVA, the mechanical ventilation was fully controlled by patient\u2019s own respiratory centres.",

In line with previous findings, in our series, a protective ventilation strategy was adopted and maintained both through PSV and NAVA, being VT persistently < 8 ml\u22121 kg\u22121 of predicted body weight during whole study duration. This could be particularly interesting in patients recovering from acute brain injury with a coexisting acute lung injury. In fact, it has been demonstrated that the neurocritical care patients undergoing high-tidal mechanical ventilation are more prone to ventilator-induced-lung-injury occurrence [36]. In keeping with our results, NAVA could represent a good solution to assure a low-tidal-protective ventilation and prevent ventilator-induced-lung injury after the early phases of acute brain injury.",

In good agreement with previous investigations [13\u201315, 17, 18, 37, 38], also in our study patient-ventilator matching was better during NAVA application compared to that observed in PSV. Indeed, the inspiratory and expiratory trigger delay in NAVA were shorter than those recorded in PSV.

In good agreement with previous investigations [14\u201318], also in our setting NAVA improved PVI by diminishing asynchrony index and macroasynchronies occurrence compared to PSV1 and PSV2, respectively. Indeed, only 30% of patients experienced an asynchrony index \u2265 10% in NAVA against 73.3% and 100% in PSV1 and PSV2, respectively. Thus, the total amount of macroasynchronies was lower in NAVA compared to both PSV trials. Taking into account the different types of asynchronies detected, in PSV1 and PSV2 the ineffective efforts were the most detected asynchrony events (among 62% and 67%), followed by autotriggers (among 26% and 30%) and double triggers (among 11% and 2%). Contrariwise, in NAVA, the double triggers (43%) occurred more frequently compared to the ineffective efforts (39%) and autotriggers (17%). No reverse triggers were observed during all the trials. These findings are in line with previous results achieved in intubated patients with acute respiratory failure [15, 16], also undergoing weaning trial [39]. What is novel in our results is that, regardless of ventilatory mode, the asynchrony index and the macroasynchrony events incidence were higher in our patients compared to those reported in previous investigations [14\u201316, 39]. This could depend on two aspects: (1) neurocritical patients are more prone to asynchronies development probably because of different respiratory drive characteristics [40] compared to those described in acute respiratory failure [14\u201316]; (2) in handling with acute brain injury, deep sedation levels are more frequently achieved and longer maintained [4] compared to the sedation plans adopted in intubated general ICU patients, with the well-described effects on neural respiratory drive and breathing pattern [41, 42], safety, and outcomes [43, 44].",

As matter of fact, while the ventilatory assistance delivered in NAVA is proportional to Eadi [12], during PSV, the patients receive a fixed ventilatory support that, in some cases, leads to lose the control of their own breathing pattern [45]. In keeping with previous works, also in our study, VT and Paw peak variability were better preserved in NAVA compared to those reported in PSV1 and PSV2. On the contrary, the variability of mechanical respiratory rate and Eadi peak were similar among ventilatory modes. Thus, in our neurocritical care patients, a more variable breathing pattern was assured in NAVA, compared to PSV1 and PSV2. Noteworthy, two patients developed in NAVA a Cheyne-Stokes respiration that was barely detectable in PSV in absence of pathological modification of FVmean, ICP, cerebral haemodynamics and ABGs [46].",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations that deserve discussion. First, our results have been achieved across three 30-min-lasting trials of ventilatory mode application. Although this observation time might seem quite short, it is in agreement with previous investigations evaluating not only NAVA application in invasive and non-invasive setting in course of acute respiratory failure [14, 17] but also the effects of arterial carbon dioxide tension modifications on cerebral blood flow velocity in anesthetized patients having surgery [47]. Second, the considered patients sample size was quite small. Nevertheless, it was in line with the sample sizes reported in several physiologic investigations conducted on NAVA application in different clinical settings [13, 14, 17, 18, 41, 48]. Third, our study population was not homogeneous, mainly in regard to the type of acute brain injury. Further investigations about NAVA application in neurocritical care patients should therefore be planned by focusing on the specific aetiology of acute brain injury. Fourth, aiming to evaluate cerebral blood flow, we bilaterally performed TCCD sonography assessment only at MCA. While a full flow evaluation on three windows (temporal, orbital and foramen magnum) would be the optimal solution, MCA carries 50\u201360% of the ipsilateral carotid artery blood flow and thus can be considered to represent a great portion of the total blood flow to the hemisphere [21, 22], without losing the validity of our results. Fifth, it is worth to consider the technique limitations of TCCD sonography: (1) being an ultrasound evaluation, it is highly operator-dependent; (2) the measurements are limited to the large basal arteries and can only provide an index of global rather than local cerebral blood flow velocity [23]. To limit these variations, a unique operator conducted the cerebral blood flow sonographic evaluation. Lastly, in our setting a combination of propofol and remifentanil in continuous intravenous infusion was adopted as a sedation plan. Accordingly, the effects of these sedatives on neural respiratory drive [41, 42] must be taken into account in interpreting our data.",
