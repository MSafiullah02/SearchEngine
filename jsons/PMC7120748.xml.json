Regions of this nature appear in the DNA that encodes ribosomal RNA and in housekeeping genes that encode essential proteins. Following PCR amplification, a fully automated ESI-MS \u00adanalysis is performed. The mass spectrometer effectively weighs the PCR amplicons, or mixture of amplicons, with sufficient mass accuracy that the composition of A, G, C, and T can be deduced for each amplicon present. The base compositions are compared to a database of calculated base compositions derived from the sequences of known organisms to determine the identities of the microorganisms present. In the event that there is no match of the measured base composition with a sequence in the database, the nearest neighbor organism is identified. Thus, analysis by the PCR/ESI-MS method provides information that enables identification of a broad range of microbes in a sample without having to anticipate what microbes might be present. The identities of microbes in a mixed population are determined because the primers amplify the nucleic acids from all organisms in the sample simultaneously, and the mass spectrometer analyzes and reports on multiple peaks in the same spectrum.",

Applications of the technology can be thought of in an hourglass model as illustrated in Fig.\n1. The upper portion of the hourglass depicts identification of microbes, generally bacteria and viruses, present in an unknown sample at the species level as described. The utility of PCR/ESI-MS has been demonstrated for broad bacterial surveillance (2) and for identification of virus families, including coronaviruses (4), influenza viruses (5), adenoviruses (6), alphaviruses (7), and orthopoxviruses (3). The bottom portion of the hourglass in Fig.\n1 refers to assays developed on the PCR/ESI-MS platform that are specific for a particular species; these assays reveal molecular details such as the presence of virulence factors, antibiotic or antiviral drug resistance, or high-resolution molecular signatures that distinguish closely related subspecies. These high-resolution molecular analyses require separate assays that investigate important questions unique to a particular microbe. For example, for Staphylococcus aureus, it is important to determine the \u00adpresence or absence of certain virulence factors, mobile genetic elements, or mutations in housekeeping genes that mediate drug resistance. For understanding the genetic lineage of microbes, the PCR/ESI-MS method follows the general principles of multilocus sequence typing (MLST).\n",

While sequencing technology has become much more facile in recent years, it is still not \u00adpractical to use conventional MLST in a clinical laboratory setting. Clinical and public health laboratories require simple, automated analytical methods that match their throughput needs and cost limitations.

Typically, 100\u2013150 nucleotide regions are selected for amplification. The information values of the amplicons are evaluated until an optimal set of primer pairs is identified. Each primer pair is assigned to a position in a 96-well plate such that a sample is amplified by eight pairs of primers and analyzed by MS. Each of the primer pairs produces an amplicon that results in a spectral signal and base composition, or four-position A, G, C, T signature (but since here amplicons are generally of constant length, each base composition signature actually contains only three independent variables). Base compositions from each of the eight primer sets result in a 24-dimensional digital signature that can be compared to calculated base composition signatures generated from an MLST database.\n",

Molecular biologists generally think in terms of the sequence of the nucleotides as the signature of a microbe. But, while the potential number of distinct sequences within any given MLST locus is astronomical (4x, where x is the number of nucleotides showing mutations), the number of actual, biologically relevant sequences is typically much more manageable: First, only a fraction (10\u201320%) of the positions within MLST loci show variation. Second, most of these sites do not display the full range of possible mutations, but merely transitions. Third, only a fraction of these sites is simultaneously mutated. Thus, only 50 to 100 alleles, differentiated by specific sets of mutations, are typically reported in MLST databases for a single locus.",

            "text": "This level of resolution can be approached by base composition analysis. Any single mutation that separates one allele from another can be identified by MS analysis since even a single-nucleotide substitution results in spectral signals that can be identified as distinct masses and compositions. There are 12 possible types of single mutations (A \u2192\u2192 G, A \u2192\u2192 C, A \u2192\u2192 T, G \u2192\u2192 A, G \u2192\u2192 C, G \u2192\u2192 T, C \u2192\u2192 A, C \u2192\u2192 G, C \u2192\u2192 T, T \u2192\u2192 A, T \u2192\u2192 G, and T \u2192\u2192 C), and all result in masses that are unique (see\nFig.\n3). As additional mutations occur, the resulting space of possible base compositions grows accordingly, following a third-degree polynomial expression (Fig.\n3). Of course, not all possible base compositions are actually generated with a given set of alleles, and each allele does not necessarily generate its own distinct base composition. The most common way for two alleles to share the same base composition is to differ from each other by one of the six self-cancelling pairs of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (e.g., A \u2192\u2192 G and G \u2192\u2192 A or A \u2192\u2192 C and C \u2192\u2192 A). If three SNPs are involved, retrieving the same base composition involves one of the eight possible \u201ctriangular\u201d mutation patterns (e.g., A \u2192\u2192 G, G \u2192\u2192 C, C \u2192\u2192 A), whereas with four SNPs \u201cquadrangular\u201d mutation patterns are possible (e.g., A \u2192\u2192 G, G \u2192\u2192 C, C \u2192\u2192 T, T \u2192\u2192 A). As is apparent in Table\n1, the occurrence of such combinations decreases as the number of SNPs increases, meaning that base compositions naturally tend to be more diverse as the number of SNPs increases in the allele set. In practice, a typical PCR/ESI-MS amplicon of a MLST gene carries from two to six mutations, which is enough to observe a number of distinct base compositions in the same order of magnitude (about 70% on average) as the number of alleles that are distinguished by sequence within the same locus.\n\n",

For these \u00adorganisms, short repeated elements known as variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) have proven to be useful markers (9). These elements vary in the number of repeats of short strings of nucleotides. Examples of organisms for which VNTR elements have been used to establish clonality are Bacillus anthracis (10), Francisella tularensis (9), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (11). VNTR analysis can be conducted using PCR/ESI-MS simply by designing primers that bracket the VNTR. The base composition of the amplicon is used to precisely calculate the number of repeats as well as any single-nucleotide variations that may appear within the repeat, providing greater resolving power than the repeat count that is obtained from gel analysis. VNTR, SNP, and MLST analyses can be combined into a single assay with PCR/ESI-MS, if simultaneous analysis of genetic biomarkers with a range of clock speeds is desired, simply by bracketing the appropriate target region on the microbial genome with PCR primers and assembling the primer set in 96-well plate configuration as shown in Fig.\n2.",

Primer pairs were designed to the S. pyogenes MLST gene targets that correlate with the emm classification. To identify target regions that provided the highest resolution of species and least ambiguous emm classification by base composition analysis, we constructed an alignment of concatenated alleles of the seven MLST housekeeping genes from each of 212 previously emm-typed strains (12) and determined the number and location of the primer pairs that would maximize strain discrimination. An initial set of 24 primer pairs was selected that would amplify regions covering over 97% of the known nucleotide variations in the MLST sequencing targets. We then determined how much strain discrimination could be achieved from a smaller set of primers. Calculations showed that six pairs of primers allowed discrimination at the individual emm-type level of about 75% of all the emm types listed by Enright et al. (12), while the remaining 25% clustered into groups of two or more emm types. This degree of resolution is sufficient for applications such as tracking the clonal expansion of a particular strain type during a specific epidemic.",

During blast injuries, wounds frequently become inoculated with soil organisms, leading to infections that later occur in the hospital. Over a 2-yr period from 2002 to 2004, military health officials identified 102 patients with blood cultures that grew A. baumannii from Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany and from Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) in the United States.

Twenty-seven isolates from the outbreak in the military personnel were found to have genotypes representing different Acinetobacter species, including 8 representatives of Acinetobacter sp. 13TU and 13 representatives of Acinetobacter sp. 3. However, most of the isolates from the Iraqi conflict were A. baumannii (189 of 216 isolates). Among these, 111 isolates had genotypes identical or very similar to those associated with well-characterized A. baumannii isolates from European hospitals (Table\n3). This observation suggested a second mode for the origin of A. baumannii infections: contamination with European strains that had developed multidrug resistance and properties that favored hospital transmission. Remarkably, isolates from WRAMC showed genotypes from all three major clones I, II, and III obtained from the European hospital collection (16,17), suggesting that the U.S. service personnel were exposed to a diverse set of European strain types.\n",

Despite higher mutation rates and greater sequence variability than bacteria, conserved primer target sites can be identified that enable priming of entire genera or even complete viral families. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is a housekeeping gene common to all RNA viruses that provides several target site opportunities for developing primers that amplify multiple species within a virus family. This strategy is powerful because a single PCR reaction analyzed by MS can be used to detect and identify tens to hundreds of related viral species. The inherently high mutation rate of viruses results in base composition differences that provide a high-resolution molecular signature of viral subtypes. Generally, at least two sets of primer pairs are targeted to different regions of the viral genome for each virus group, and potential misclassification is avoided because two regions taken together provide unambiguous speciation and subtype determination. For example, we used PCR/ESI-MS to identify and subspeciate over 50 types of adenoviruses (6). This strategy has also been used effectively for detection and strain typing of influenza viruses (5), alphaviruses (7), coronaviruses (4), and orthopox\u00adviruses (3).",

The total number of base compositions that can be reached after x mutations follows a third-degree polynomial progression: N\nBC(x) = (2x + 1)(5x(x + 1) + 3)/3. (See Color Plates)",

For each of the four organisms, a set of unique sequences types (STs) was first assembled using six or seven genes commonly used for MLST. These reference alignments were then used for the design of 16 to 24 primer pairs for PCR/ESI-MS analysis. The resolution provided by PCR/ESI-MS analysis was evaluated as follows: Starting with the primer pair providing the best sequence resolution, amplicon base compositions were determined for each of the sequence types. Comparison of these base composition signatures defined the number of sequences types that were incompatible with any particular type at this particular locus. The average proportion of sequence types excluded by PCR/ESI-MS with their corresponding standard deviations (vertical lines) was plotted versus the number of loci used in the analysis. This process was repeated, using base composition signatures extended by one additional locus at a time, to yield the full curves shown. (See Color Plates)",
