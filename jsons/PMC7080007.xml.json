In areas with persistently warm temperatures and high humidity (close to the equator), however, RSV activity is more continuous throughout the year. More continuous RSV activity is also seen in areas with colder temperatures throughout the year [13].",

In summer, 0.4 % of RSV-infected children with CHD were hospitalized, compared to 0.05 % of RSV-infected children without CHD. These figures were similar for RTI in general. Among children with CHD who were infected with general RTI, hospitalization rates were 5.0 % in the winter and 3.0 % in the summer; children without CHD who were infected by RTI in general had hospitalization rates of 0.7 % in the winter and 0.3 % in the summer. The individual risk of any child being hospitalized for RSV was approximately 17.2/1000 (1.7 %) during the first year of life, according to a recent Swedish study [20]. Our study presents lower risk estimations for non-CHD children, but greatly increased risk for children with CHD.",

This prophylactic treatment is only recommended during the winter, according to the Swedish national guidelines for the study period, and includes children less than six months of age with congenital heart defects, such as Down syndrome with non-operated shunt defects, and shunt defects with heart failure. Children 1 year of age with univentricular heart defects in status post-bidirectional Glenn-operation, children with additional lung disease and pulmonary hypertension and those waiting for transplantation were also included. Prophylaxis with palivizumab is individually prescribed to each child with CHD who fulfills the indications for prophylactic treatment according to the guidelines. The overall risk of RSV hospitalization for CHD children during winter was lower than the risk hospitalization due to RTI in general. Thus, one can argue that the prophylactic treatment for RSV was effective. Additionally, according to our results, the strategy of RSV prophylactic treatment seems to lower the risk of hospitalization among the most severe cases during the winter. Perhaps, these children are less likely to be missed in the prophylactic treatment program by the pediatric cardiologist. In a previous study, we found that almost half the CHD patients had delays to the start of prophylactic treatment, but this accounted mainly for children with systemic-pulmonary shunt defects [22]. Since children with less severe forms of CHD have a higher risk of RSV hospitalization in the winter than the more severe cases of CHD, the present study indicates that even the less severe forms of CHD carry a substantial risk of hospitalization.",

Rather than suggesting extensive prophylactic treatment, we would like to stress the overall vulnerability for these children, including the risks of RSV infection as well as severe RTI in general, throughout the whole year. Information to parents and healthcare staff must include the risk of severe viral RTI during winter season but also in summer.

As the treatment is similar for all types of RTI, it is of little importance to the clinician whether the child has RSV or not, so not all affected children are tested. Only the tested cases are reported to the Swedish Public Health Agency [25], and the agency only collected data on the numbers of RSV infections during the winter season and published weekly on their Web site. Waiting for this reporting to start may delay prophylactic treatment and RSV protection for children with CHD. We argue for local testing and reporting to pediatric cardiologists, as well as to the Swedish Public Health Agency. Testing for RSV can be less common during summer, so there is a risk of under-reporting. This must account for CHD children as well as non-CHD children. RSV infections can occur sporadically throughout the year, especially in areas with colder weather throughout the year, or areas with small seasonal changes in the climate [13]. However, prophylaxis with palivizumab in the summer, when RSV prevalence is generally low in Sweden, cannot be recommended. In countries with subtropical climates, the RSV season can last up to ten months, so the period for giving prophylaxis may follow the local epidemiology [26].",
