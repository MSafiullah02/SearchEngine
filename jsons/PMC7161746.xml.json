Disease severity (BSA, PASI), treatments received before/after flaring, other triggers, and timing between RTI and flare were also recorded. Patients had nasopharyngeal swab tests for multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of 16 viral pathogens and four bacteria (Chlamydophila pneumonia, Mycoplasma pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila, Bordetella sp.) (RespiFinder 2SMART\u00ae, Pathofinder, Maastricht, the Netherlands), and for bacterial culture.

A total of 21 patients (84%) received at baseline a systemic treatment for psoriasis (conventional agents and phototherapy, n = 7; biological agents, n = 14; antitumour necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1, n = 8; anti\u2010interleukin (IL)\u201012/23, n = 5; anti\u2010IL\u201017, n = 1). The median delay between the first RTI symptoms and psoriasis flare onset was 2 (1\u201330) days. Eight patients showed a change of psoriasis clinical phenotype vs. baseline (guttate and pustular in, respectively, six and two patients with PV). The median BSA (range)/PASI (range) at flaring was 19% (10\u2013100)/15\u00b75 (4\u00b79\u201325\u00b75) vs. 2% (0\u201315)/3\u00b76 (0\u201315\u00b75) at last available assessment prior to RTI. Patients\u2019 self\u2010assessment of BSA was also used to check that the 50% worsening threshold was reached. PV (7 of 22 cases) and GPP (4 of 4) flares led to admission, including in the intensive care unit for one patient with DITRA (deficiency of the IL\u201036 receptor antagonist). Out of 31 nasopharyngeal swab tests, 25 (81%) were positive (Table 1). Overall, 21 of 25 patients had at least one positive multiplex PCR viral test, with Rhinovirus and Coronavirus as the most frequently detected pathogens, while only two of 25 bacterial swabs were positive (one each for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus dysgalactiae). There was no other trigger recorded in 24 cases, while patient 6 reported delayed ustekinumab injection and psychological stress, respectively, for two flares, both associated with positive viral tests. Six patients (3 GPP and 3 PV) presented two flares during the study. All patients reported history of previous acute psoriasis flares following RTI, including two patients with GPP/DITRA sharing the homozygous c.80T>C; p.Leu27Pro severe mutation.6 No genetic abnormality was detected in IL36RN, CARD14 and AP1S3 in other patients. Finally, acute flares led to changes in antipsoriatic regimen in all cases, including new onset or switch of conventional or biological treatment in five.",

Although the design of our study does not allow us to ascertain the causality of RTI in acute PV or GPP flares, potentially life\u2010threatening for the latter, several arguments support its imputability: (i) the short delay between viral infection symptoms onset and psoriasis flare (mean 2 days), (ii) the repetition of viral RTI in five cases, and (iii) psoriasis phenotypic changes following infection with presence of guttate and pustular lesions in patients with PV. Guttate psoriasis has been previously related to streptococcal pharyngeal infection in epidemiological and immunological studies.7 A case\u2013control study suggested that recent pharyngeal infection was associated with a seven fold increased risk of guttate psoriasis, although without identifying the infectious agent.3 We previously showed that production of pathogenic cytokines/chemokines IL\u201036\u2010\u03b3 and CXCL8 was enhanced in primary keratinocytes from patients with DITRA after stimulation with polyinosinic\u2013polycytidylic acid, a Toll\u2010like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist mimicking RNA of respiratory viruses, suggestive of dysregulated innate immune responses in these patients.5, 8 As several inflammatory cytokines downstream from TLR3, including IL\u201036, have been shown to be pathogenic in GPP and PV, the present results pave the way for larger epidemiological studies assessing the actual impact of viral triggers on psoriasis course.",
