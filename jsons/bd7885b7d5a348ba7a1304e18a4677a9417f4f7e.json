If we want systems to meet more health needs, and we should, then we prefer more effi cient health systems. Specifi cally, if we think we have obligations to meet more health needs, or if we think meeting more \"does more good,\" and we ought to do as much good as we can with the resources we have, then we have an ethical basis for seeking more effi cient health systems.

Indeed, reasonable people will disagree about how much priority to give to the sickest (or worst off) patients. They may think we have to weigh the seriousness of an illness against the potential benefi t that we know how to deliver, they may disagree about how to trade off those considerations, or they may disagree about when modest benefi ts to larger numbers of people outweigh greater benefi ts delivered to fewer people. Together these \"unsolved rationing\" problems-the best outcome versus fair chances problem (when to prefer best outcomes to fair chances), the priorities problem (how much priority to give to those who are worst off), and the aggregation problem (when do modest benefi ts to more people outweigh significant benefi ts to fewer people)-mean that there is pervasive ethical disagreement underlying many resou rce allocation problems (Daniels 1993 ) .",

Denials of such interventions in last-chance cases have been considered the \"third rail\" of resource allocation decisions (Daniels and Sabin 2008 ) .

To see this, consider two widely used tools: comparative effectiveness research (CER) , which has been given prominence as a r esearch focus in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 , and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) . Both help to answer policy-making questions. For example, a typical use of CER compares the effectiveness of two interventions (drugs, procedures, or even two methods of delivery), and policy makers may want to know if a new technology is more effective than older technologies.",

Similarly, if there is only one effective treatment for a condition, CER tells us nothing useful. It also tells us nothing about whether a more effective intervention is worth its extra cost. And, CER cannot help us compare intervention outcomes across different disease conditions, since it uses no measure of health that permits a comparison of effectiveness. Indeed, decision makers face many resource allocation questions that cannot be answered by CER, even if CER can help avoid wasteful investments in interventions that do not work or that offer no improvement ov er others.",

This use of CER allows German decision makers to negotiate the price of treatments with manufacturers, rejecting payments that yield ineffi cient improvements. German policy makers can then cover every effective intervention sold at a price that makes it reasonably effi cient. Still, because German use of CER cannot make comparisons across diseases, it allows vast differences in effi ciency across conditions. CEA aims for greater scope than CER. It deploys a common unit for measuring health outcomes , either a disability-adjusted life year (DALY) or a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) . This unit purports to combine duration with quality, permitting us to compare health states across a range of disease conditions. With this measure of health effects, we can construct a ratio (the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, or IC ER) of the change in costs that results from the new intervention with the change in health effects (as measured by QALYs or DALYs). We can then calculate the cost per QALY (or DAL Y) and arrive at an effi ciency measure for a range of interventions that apply to different condi tions.",

By constructing a unit of health effectiveness , such as the QALY, CEA assumes this unit has the same value , regardless of who gets it or wherever it goes in a life (\"A QALY is a QALY\" is the slogan). But intuitively, many people think that a unit of health is worth more if someone who is relatively worse off (sicker) gets it rather than someone who is better off (less sick) (Brock 2002 ) . At the same time, people generally do not think we should give complete priority to those who are worse off. We may be able to do little for them, so giving them priority means we would have to forego doing more good for others.

Is it to meet the health needs of a population or is it to provide a good return on investment for those who invest in health services? We might think that this question is easier to answer in a system where health care delivery is seen largely as a public undertaking aimed at improving population health. In such a system, it might seem that there is only one purpose behind the health care system. Return on investment for the taxpayer funding such a system should be measured by how effi ciently the system improves population health. In systems where resources are owned privately (and there are many of these), however, it seems we must consider at least two goals. Even if the private sector must in part seek to improve population health , which may be a requirement of state-imposed health care regulation or, in some people's opinions, a social responsibility of corporations, private health-care organizations still must deliver a reasonable return on investment for owners. Thus, policy makers within private health-care organizations have a dual task. Balancing return on investment with improvement in populatio n health thus becomes the central issue in the Colombian case study.",

Or, we might think of effi ciency as a ranking of needs by severity of condition. In the latter, the resource allocation case turns on how we defi ne effi ciency.

If this were the case, the more effi cient system, in this nonstandard view, would rank treating more severe conditions as more effi cient than treating less severe conditions.

The GBD for mental illness amounts to 14 % of the world's total disease burden (World Health Organization 2005 ). I n the United State s alone, every fi fth child suffers from a mental disorder (Perou et al. 2013 ) . Although mental illness clearly causes disabilities (Prince et al. 2007 ), underservice to those with mental illness is commonplace. Lack of access to mental health services counts as the fi rst of many hurdles facing families who have a child with a mental illness. Stigma and the lack of parity in health coverage for physical and mental illness are other hurdles for these families. Not surprisingly, these hurdles can critically affect the development of children with mental illness. Lack of access to mental and behavioral health services for children 5 years and younger especially threatens their development. Rapid brain growth occurs in the fi rst 5 years of life, which lays the foundation for cognitive, emotional, and moral development. Exposure to chronic stress can prompt the release of hormones in the brain that can have enduring consequences for how the adult brain is organized and how it functions (Shonkoff and Phillips 2000 ) . Because poor health can show up in children as developmental delay, access to mental and behavioral health services is critical. Longitudinal studies demonstrate positive and long-acting effects of early childhood interventions, such as environmental enrichment programs, on a range of cognitive and noncognitive skills, social behaviors, academic achievement, and adult job performance (Heckman 2008 ) . The esti mated annual rate of return on investment from targeted early childhood development programs is 7 %, and early intervention reduces the predictable need for higher, more costly levels of care in later life (Heckman et al. 2010 ) .",

Population health challenges, such as infl uenza pandemics, are increasingly complex, and tackling them involves urgently executing a wide array of public health measures to prevent disease transmission. In the case of infl uenza pandemics, measures can vary from border quarantine, social distancing, provision of antivirals and vaccine s, and personal hygiene strategies. Recommendations often need to be made quickly even when knowledge about the seriousness and potential health and social effects are incomplete. The target for preventive interventions is the entire population. However, resources for intense and sustained health campaigns through mass communications are expensive. In addition, the social determinants of the disease must be understood and considered (Crowcroft and Rosella 2012 ) . This typically involves the need for policies that engage the health and non-health sectors, such as educational policies and social or economic factors (Savoia et al. 2012 ).

To make the best use of resources and personnel (even in the absence of a pandemic), patients are triaged-evaluated to determine the type and priority of care to be received.

For public health emergencies that overwhelm capacity, some propose adjusting critical care triage criteria to emphasize certain public health goals, like saving the most lives possible (Christian et al. 2006 ; Silva et al. 2010 ) .",

What considerations might exist during a pandemic that do not exist in everyday critical care and critical care triage that do or do not support the modifi cation of triage criteria? If pandemic critical care triage requires a unique conceptual framework, what principles ought to be valued in such a framework (e.g. need, equality, utility, effi ciency)? 3. Would the severity of a pandemic ever warrant the use of a utilitarian scheme for critical care triage, given that the public generally fi nds it unpalatable and carrying out such a plan could require coercion? How could an adverse public reaction to coercive or covert measures be mitigated? 4. In a pandemic, the most seriously ill patients with the lowest probability of being saved might be left untreated because their care would require too many resources with little prospect of recovery. This illustrates a confl ict between the common good and the best interests of individual patients. What other confl icts might arise when triaging in a pandemic? 5. Triage can be used to maximize the number of lives saved with available resources. Should we aim to maximize the number of lives or, alternatively, the number of life years saved?

U.S. health policy leaders have made the elimination of health disparities a top public health priority (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2011 ; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2011 ). Infant mortality is an important area of focus for eliminating disparities, both in its own right and because the rate of infant mortality serves as an indicator of the nation's health due to its association with maternal health, social and economic conditions, racial discrimination, access to health care, and public health practices (MacDorman and Mathews 2009 ). During the twentieth century, U.S. infant mortality declined 93 % (MacDorman 2011 ).",

In particular, acute care needs for the critically ill and discussions of treatment priorities have been the subject of much debate in pandemic planning (Hick et al. 2007 ; Melnychuk and Kenny 2006 ; Uscher-Pines et al. 2006 ). This is not surprising, as it has been estimated that more than 700,000 Americans may require mechanical ventilation during a pandemic, far outnumbering available ventilators (Rubinson et al. 2010 ; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2005 ) . Additionally, shortages of hospital beds, personnel, and other equipment can be expected during a pandemic, which may limit the ability to meet an expected increase in patient volu me (World Health Organization 2008 ).Prudentially planning for the public's increased care needs during a pandemic requires assessing surge capacity, especially in critical care units (CCU). However, as pandemics increase in severity, they can overwhelm critical care capacity and",
