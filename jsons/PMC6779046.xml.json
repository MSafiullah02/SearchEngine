In brief, the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Inc.) was used for nucleic acid extraction. Extracted nucleic acid was amplified using the FluChip-8G Amplification Reagents (InDevR, Inc.) which amplify full-length influenza A gene segments HA, NA, M, non-structural (NS), and nucleoprotein (NP), full length influenza B HA and NA gene segments, and a portion of the eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene as an internal control. During amplification, biotin-16-aminoallyl-2\u2019 dUTP is incorporated to enable downstream labeling by a streptavidin-coupled fluorophore. Post-amplified PCR products were fragmented at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min prior to microarray hybridization. After hybridization, the microarray was labeled and analyzed using the fluorescence-based FluChip-8G Imaging System (InDevR, Inc.).",

This translates to a detection sensitivity of \u223c160 genome copies/reaction. While the H1N1v virus tested (A/swine/Illinois/4L013/2015) was consistently identified correctly as influenza A, it was often identified as both A/non-seasonal and mis-identified as an A/H1N1pdm09 virus. The LOD for this strain was therefore based on the concentration above which the results included the correct call of A/non-seasonal. Below the LOD, the H1N1v samples were misidentified as A/H1N1pdm09 without the corresponding A/non-seasonal result. The H3N2v virus strain (A/Indiana/08/2011) resulted in correct identification as non-seasonal influenza A above the LOD, but was misidentified at lower concentrations as an A/H1N1pdm09. These misidentifications are likely due to the genetic similarity of H1N1v and H3N2v strains to the seasonally circulating H1N1pdm09 virus. The H1N1pdm09 virus has continually reassorted with swine influenza A viruses, generating diverse reassortant genotypes (Nelson et al., 2016). Specifically, the H1N1v for which the LOD was determined, A/swine/Illinois/4L013/2015, shares the M and NP gene segments with H1N1pdm09 strains, and the HA and NS gene segments have > 90% sequence homology. The H3N2v strain (A/Indiana/08/2011) shares the M gene with H1N1pdm09 strains, and the NP and NS gene segments also have >90% sequence homology. Given that HA, NA, M, NP, and NS are the gene segments targeted by the FluChip-8G assay, it is not surprising that these viruses are mis-identified at low concentrations. In the event of an H1N1v or H3N2v infection, we note that the specimen would still be identified as influenza positive, enabling appropriate treatment. In addition, specimens with high enough H1N1v or H3N2v titer would produce a dual infection result that would prompt reanalysis and still enable appropriate follow-up by public health authorities.",

As mentioned, six (6) of the thirty-four (34) tested bacteria and viruses did result in at least one internal control failure at the initial concentration analyzed. As these microorganisms were not purified, it was hypothesized that the complex crude bacterial growth medium they were supplied in caused assay inhibition resulting in internal control failures. To further investigate whether the internal control failures were due to the growth medium or to the organism itself, the microorganisms were subsequently diluted and reanalyzed. In four (4) cases (M. catarrhalis, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, and P. aeruginosa (strain Shr42)) the cross-reactivity was resolved, indicating the growth medium was the likely cause. Internal control failures recurred in samples containing M. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis even after dilution. Purified samples of these organisms were obtained, and upon reanalysis all remaining internal control failures were resolved. As indicated above, the bacterial growth medium would not be expected in a clinical or surveillance setting for which the assay is intended.",

The expected assay results were obtained for 98.5% (95% CI of 97.1\u201399.2) of samples run at or above the LOD regardless of operator, site, testing day, and reagent lot. Below the LOD, a positive influenza result was obtained in only 22.6% (95% CI of 18.0\u201327.9) of samples run below the LOD. This increased variability is expected for concentrations below the assay LOD due to the stochastic nature of PCR-based amplification at low input copy number.",

If challenged with an infection of a novel or emerging influenza A virus strain, most available assays would produce an influenza A \u201cunsubtypeable\u201d result that would require reflex testing to an alternative assay with the capability to screen for high priority non-seasonal A viruses such as H5N1 or H7N9. The ability to detect and positively identify a wide variety of novel or emerging influenza viruses as \u201cnon-seasonal\u201d influenza A in the same assay in which seasonally circulating influenza viruses are characterized is therefore unique compared to other available influenza molecular diagnostic assays. In addition, the full gene segment amplification approach combined with pattern-recognition based data analysis allows for rapid updates to the software algorithm as new viruses emerge, without requiring changes to the assay procedure. We hope the availability of this same day result will better enable rapid and appropriate notification of public health authorities in the case of identification of a potentially pandemic virus to enhance pandemic preparedness efforts. Clinical validation of the technology in a multi-site clinical study is the subject of a separate investigation and will be published separately.",
