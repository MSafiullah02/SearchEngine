Developing models that can interpret the epidemic and give common trend parameters are useful for prediction purposes by other countries that are at an earlier phase of the epidemic; it is also useful for future planning against viral respiratory diseases. One model is developed to interpret the fast-growth phase of the epidemic and another model for the full interpretation during the fast-, slow-and plateau phases. Both models are shown to agree reasonably with the data. It is shown that during the fast phase, the number of new infected cases in several countries depends on the total number of cases by a power-law relation with a scaling exponent equal to 0.82. During this phase, the duplication time is 1 -3 days. The duplication time together with another parameter that controls the phase change from the fast phase to the slow and plateau phases, varying in the range of 0.1 -0.5, may be used for data interpretation and for guiding predictions regarding this disease, e.g. the onset of the maximum in the number of new cases.",

One month later, the discovery of the responsible virus, SARS-CoV-2, was announced [1] . The respiratory disease, which is termed Covid-19, is an ongoing global health concern with many countries affected so far. While a great momentum in the scientific community is to find therapeutics and vaccines against Covid-19 [2] , it seems beneficial to develop simple models to understand the trends of the epidemic [3, 4] . Previous attempts have been made to this end. New models are generally adopted from the previous models of avian and swine flu epidemics [5, 6] , and may be used to make predictions regarding the Covid-19 epidemic, e.g. to simulate spreading to neighboring regions from hot spots, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the mitigating measures [7] [8] [9] . Available models have generally estimated a human-to-human transmissibility of the disease, which is called the basic reproduction number, o R . Estimations of o R give values larger than 2 denoting a highly contagious virus [5, 10, 11] . Simpler models exist and have been used for example to compare between different SARS epidemics [12, 13] .",

In particular, with respect to the several periods for an epidemic, the presented analysis focuses on the first period, before the so-called herd immunity period. In the herd immunity and in the absence of a vaccine, the virus stops expanding when 60% of a population is contaminated [14] [15] [16] . A Californian study has shown that the number of contaminated people in this region was 50 times more than the total number of reported cases [17] . Applying this factor to France's numbers, with a current total cases of about 1.8\u00d710 5 , this factor gives about 7.5 million contaminated cases. This number of cases is equivalent to 12% of the French population. Recently, another study stated that this number was about 5.7% on average and about 12% in the region Ile-de-France [18] . Thereby, the available data and the model presented in this work is for the first period of the epidemic before the herd immunity is acquired.",

Moreover, wherever the duplication time was obtained to be less than 1 day, its value was fixed to be equal to 1 day. In these cases, the number of the fitting parameters was reduced to 2. From Fig. 3 , it is evident that Eq. 2 provides a reasonable agreement with the data, especially considering occasional non-uniformities in the trend, e.g. in the case of Iran's data. The best fit parameters are presented in Table 2 . One observes an almost similar duplication time among these countries but different \uf061 parameters. The differences in the latter parameter show different time periods to change from the f phase to the s phase, which is e.g. two time longer for Iran as compared with South Korea. Furthermore, the number of new cases is calculated from the total number of cases as discussed previously. Thereby, Fig. 3 further shows a comparison between the latter data and calculations from the derivative of Eq. 2 using the same fit parameters. The reasonable agreement obtained from the latter comparison further shows that Eq. 2 is adequate for data interpretation.",

One finds that the duplication time \uf074 varies from 1 -3 days. The significance of this range is that during the f phase, every 1 -3 days the total number of cases is almost duplicated. This observation coincides with the strong dependence of the number of new cases on the total number of cases in the f phase discussed earlier. A high value of \uf061 parameter means that a turnover from the f phase to the s phase and the p phase occurs over a shorter time period as is the case for China (Table 2 & Fig. 1 ). For",

The temporal evolution of the total number of cases may be divided to three phases. In the f phase, it is shown that the number of new cases depends on the total number of cases in a power-law relation with an exponent 0.82 \uf062 \uf03d . The overall temporal evolution of the total number of cases, i.e. all three phases, may also be interpreted by modeling. It is found that the duplication time \uf074 is 1 -3 days and the \uf061 parameter which governs the phase change from the f phase to the s and p phases to vary from 0.1 -0.5 for the selected countries. The higher is the value of this parameter, the shorted is the period of phase change. The duplication time together with the \uf061 parameter may be used to interpret the total number of case as well as the number of new cases. The models presented in this work, and the average values which are obtained by fitting to several countries with leading number of cases, may be used for prediction purposes as well as for guiding the implementation of proper controlling measures during each phase of the epidemic. The presented model and analysis is for when the total number of infected cases is less than 10% of the entire population. In order to interpret the trends when up to 60% of the population are infected, a different model is required, which is out of the scope of the present work.",

It is shown that for a fix value of \uf061 parameter, a higher value of the duplication time \uf074 broadens the curves whereby the turnover period to the s phase and the p phase is also prolonged. Similarly, the onset of the maximum in the number of new cases is delayed. It is otherwise found that the \uf061 parameter has a reverse effect. For example, at a fix value of the duplication time \uf074 , a higher value of the \uf061 parameter shifts the curves to the left whereby the s phase and the p phase occur earlier, and similarly the onset of the maximum in the number of new cases is shortened. Thereby the \uf061 parameter gives approximately the time range between the initial growth phases and the final p phase. This variation may be abrupt when \uf061 is large (e.g. this is the case in the cell model) or may be smooth when \uf061 is small. These curves suggest that both \uf061 and \uf074 control the trend behavior from o n to n \uf0a5 .
