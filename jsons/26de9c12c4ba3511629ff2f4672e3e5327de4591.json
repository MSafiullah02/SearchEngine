The emergence of antimicrobial resistance, new pneumonia pathogens, and new drugs have prompted WHO to assemble an international panel to review the literature on childhood pneumonia and to develop evidence-based recommendations for the empirical treatment of non-severe pneumonia among children managed by fi rst-level health providers. Treatment should target the bacterial causes most likely to lead to severe disease, including Streptoccocus pneumoniae and Haemophilus infl uenzae. The best fi rst-line agent is amoxicillin, given twice daily for 3-5 days, although co-trimoxazole may be an alternative in some settings. Treatment failure should be defi ned in a child who develops signs warranting immediate referral or who does not have a decrease in respiratory rate after 48-72 h of therapy. If failure occurs, and no indication for immediate referral exists, possible explanations for failure should be systematically determined, including non-adherence to therapy and alternative diagnoses. If failure of the fi rst-line agent remains a possible explanation, suitable secondline agents include high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with or without an aff ordable macrolide for children over 3 years of age.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Each year, clinical pneumonia occurs in an estimated 156 million children aged under 5 years, 1 and causes approximately a fi fth of all deaths among such children, most of whom are in low-income nations. 2 To reduce the morbidity and mortality of pneumonia in children, guidelines currently known as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) have been developed by WHO and partners for fi rst-level health systems. IMCI has been implemented by many organisations and reduces mortality eff ectively, 3,4 although implementation can be improved. 5,6 These guidelines include recommendations for the case management of acute respiratory illness. They indicate when referral is needed and specify appropriate antimicrobial agents when referral is not needed. WHO recommendations for the treatment of pneumonia have provided critical guidance to fi rst-level health-care workers worldwide, but the last major revision is more than 10 years old. The fi rst WHO recommendations for respiratory disease case management were published in a 1981 WHO memorandum. 7 The memorandum was aimed at encouraging a systematic approach to the management of children with possible pneumonia in resource-poor settings, based on simple algorithms and empirical treatment. Recommended agents included drugs available at the time of publication, with both intramuscular and oral drugs listed, such as procaine penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, co-trimoxazole, and sulfamethoxypyridazine, and noted that there was as yet little experience with co-trimoxazole. Second-line agents for use in children still ill after 48 h included chloramphenicol or oxacillin. WHO published a revised document in 1991, after much experience had been gained with the case-management approach and empirical treatment. 8 For treatment of non-severe pneumonia at the fi rst-level health facility, this document recommended oral co-trimoxazole as the preferred agent, with injectable procaine penicillin and oral amoxicillin as alternatives. A 2005 technical update of the WHO IMCI guidelines recommended oral amoxicillin (50 mg/kg per dose, in two divided doses) or co-trimoxazole (8 mg/kg trimethoprim per dose, in two divided doses) for the treatment of non-severe pneumonia; 9 if antimicrobial resistance to co-trimoxazole was high, oral amoxicillin was preferred.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1065, "end": 1066, "text": "7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1789, "end": 1790, "text": "8", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "During the past decade, various organisations have issued recommendations for paediatric pneumonia treatment. 10-14 These recommendations are primarily intended for high-income to middle-income nations.

Non-severe pneumonia is diagnosed in a child with cough or diffi culty breathing accompanied by tachypnoea, defi ned as a respiratory rate of at least 40 breaths per min in a child aged 12-59 months, or at least 50 breaths per min in an infant aged 2-11 months.

Variation may be real, due to increased proportions of aetiologies due to high HIV prevalence, as well as seasonal (eg, infl uenza) and geographical (eg, Salmonella) variability. However, the primary source of variability may be due to measurement, either enrolment criteria (hospitalised versus outpatient enrolment), inadequate diagnostic testing of blood cultures with low yield (eg, blood culture), or misclassifi cation (eg, urine antigen testing). Previous antimicrobial administration also may result in underestimation of some agents, and poor laboratory quality can also play an important part. 57 Zero percentages (except in the case of Klebsiella) are often due to lack of diagnostic testing and the use of poor or insensitive tests, which are the important reasons for failure to consistently identify these pathogens, although in some cases true seasonal or geographical variations may contribute. Review estimates of the common pathogens that cause pneumonia in children are required to determine appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy. Whereas these recommendations are for non-severe pneumonia, it is important to remember that aetiological studies usually enrol hospital inpatients with severe pneumonia. The common bacterial and viral causes of pneumonia pathogens are shown in table 2. Estimates include rather broad ranges of the plausible aetiological fractions. Most studies lack comprehensive investigation of viral causes of pneumonia, but in the studies that do provide such estimates, approximately 25% (range 9-64%) of pneumonia acquired in the community has a positive viral diagnostic test.
