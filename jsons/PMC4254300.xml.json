In MS, a chronic immune-mediated disease, auto-reactive cells attack the CNS tissue. The specific CNS target molecules are yet to be described. Current genetic information suggests that the critical molecules involved in disease pathogenesis are immunologic, although whether the primary triggering stage is an inflammatory and autoimmune or neurological remains to be elucidated. However, it is evident that MS is characterized by the infiltration of inflammatory cells to the CNS, demyelination, and axonal damage [1]. Lesions appear as demyelinating plaques in both the white and gray matter of the brain and the spinal cord. The most common symptoms of MS are consistent with both gray and white matter disease including fatigue, numbness, coordination worseness, vertigo, bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction, vision reduction, dizziness, pain, emotional stress and depression [2]. Clinically MS is characterized by either relapsing/remitting or a progressive condition [3].",

Interestingly, since the time of its first description by the French neurologist Charcot in the late 1800\u2019s the female/male ratio has shifted from 1:1 to its current incidence in which it exceeds 3:1 female to male [4]. This differential gender ratio has arisen the last decades with an apparent differential change, depending on the geographical location [5]. This difference in female/male MS susceptibility is common in other, but not all, autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [6]. The endocrine system might be responsible for the differences in the susceptibility female/male ratio; however, genetic and immunological factors are no doubt part of this complex interaction between the neuronal and immune system. In this article, both consistent and conflicting hypothesis that aim to explain the genetic and or environmental source for this devastating disease will be reviewed. Moreover, we will postulate the importance of the microbial populations that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract as an ecosystem where multiple disease risk factors merge. We hypothesize that the gut microbiome is an adaptable \u201cacquired\u201d immune organ that can modulate the severity MS disease. We speculate with the possible role of specific gut microbes and more importantly specific antigen(s) derived from commensal microbiota as both effectors and regulators of CNS demyelination and perhaps affective disorders as well.",

            "text": "The incidence of a number of autoimmune diseases is higher in women than men. Genetic factors define hormonal differences between females and males. Also, the effect of X-chromosome linked mutations has been suggested to affect autoimmune processes [6]. However, genetic factors might not be sufficient to explain the documented rise in the female/male ratio observed in the last decades. In the CNS, immune cells regulate inflammatory processes, but other brain-derived modulatory factors also play a role, by the production of cytokines and hormones, in processes mediated by the autonomic neuronal system. Receptors expressed in immune cells sense cytokines and hormones allowing a critical interaction between the immune, neuronal, and endocrine system. Multiple immune functions such as activation, proliferation, chemotaxis, phagocytic activity and cytotoxic functions are regulated by different endocrine pathways that take place within the CNS. In women with MS, an increased risk factor is conferred when DRB1*1501 is combined with the estrogen receptor alpha-4 (ER\u03b14) polymorphism [12]. Estrogens are sex hormones with well-documented effects in the immune system [6]. Estrogen interaction with its receptors expressed in T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, natural killer cells and others have been shown to impact the activation and immune function of innate and adaptive immune cells, including regulatory T (Treg) cells [6]. Estrogen administration protects mice against EAE [13] and oral treatment with estriol reduces the number of brain active lesions in female RRMS and SPMS patients, according to a phase I study [14]. A phase II trial studied the effect of a combination of oral estriol with injections of glatiramer acetate for two years, as it was recently reported by Voskuhl and colleagues at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) 66th Annual Meeting [15]. Treatment with estriol and glatiramer acetate reduced in a 47% the number of relapses after 12 months, and after 24 months the relapse rate reduction was 32% when compared with the placebo plus glatiramer acetate. Although the mechanism of action is not fully understood, in EAE estrogen treatment promotes tolerogenic antigen presenting cells, enhances the expression of the immuno-modulatory programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on B cells and reduces Th17 levels while regulates the suppressive function of Treg cells [16].",

In non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, gut microbes influenced the levels of sex hormones and had a significant effect in pancreatic beta-cell destruction, insulitis and protection against Type 1 Diabetes. Authors hypothesized that the microbiome interacts with genetic risk factors through changes in the endocrine system [17]. Another recently published work suggests that the microbiome determines the different autoimmune susceptibility between females and males [18]. We will further discuss the effect of diet on the gut microbiota and how diet and gut microbes modulate disease severity. It is possible to hypothesize that the increases observed in the female/male ratios are based on the significant changes observed in our lifestyle, including habits such as smoking, consumption of high-fat diets, stress, use of antibiotics and others. More directly related to females is the use of contraceptive methods and their undetermined effect on MS susceptibility [19]. All these factors impact the endocrine and the immune system, but also impact the microbial gut ecosystem.",

Over 200 genes are associated to vitamin D function, and suppression of antibody production and enhancement of Th2-type immune responses have been linked to vitamin D [24]. Epidemiological studies showed that high levels of 25-OH Vitamin D in peripheral blood correlated with a reduced risk of MS in Caucasian women, and was indirectly associated with high percentages of Treg cells in MS patients [24]. In northern Europe, areas suffering low UV light exposure and vitamin D deficiency show an inverse correlation with the risk of MS, despite the genetic susceptibility due to the high frequency of HLA-DRB1 associated with these regions [25]. The inverse correlation with MS risk described for these low sun exposure areas could represent an example of the multifactorial nature of the risks associated with MS. As reviewed by Simpson and colleagues [25], diet and specifically vitamin D supplementation in the diet could be a critical element to consider, as suggested by a study showing that the diet used by the population of this Scandinavian area is far, more abundant on vitamin D when compared to other European regions [26].",

            "text": "Because of the described mechanisms to modulate the immune system, vitamin D may directly affect the gut microbiota composition. Mai and collaborators first described a link between diet-dependent Vitamin D intake and an altered composition of the gut microbiome [27]. A reduced vitamin D intake could promote the altered immune responses, such as effects in the induction of FoxP3+ Treg cells and reduced T cell gut homing. These immune effects could affect directly the microbial populations of the gut, as suggested by Ly and colleagues [28], and lead to disease. One of the most widely studied gut symbiont, Bacteroides fragilis, produces a polysaccharide (PSA) that, as reviewed later in further detail, promotes the induction of gut FoxP3+ Treg cells. As reported by Mazmanian and his group, B. fragilis derived PSA and vitamin D interaction appears to exacerbate the induction of FoxP3+ Treg cells and promotes enhanced protection against experimental autoimmunity. Moreover, preliminary studies indicate that PSA can promote the production of colonic 1,25-Dihyroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) from the 25D precursor, also a precursor for vitamin D [29]. Given the experimental evidence showing that 1,25D activates the induction of Treg cells [30], it is possible that a direct connection between vitamin D and PSA Treg cells induction pathways contribute to the association between diet, vitamin D deficiency, the gut microbiome, and a merged risk factor for autoimmune diseases.",

Nevertheless, stress is associated with significant changes in the autonomic nervous system, the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis, and the vascular system [39]. In EAE, induction of stress has a significant impact on disease severity, as reviewed by Lovera and Reza [40], and case-control studies in humans suggest a link between stress conditions and relapses [41] and disease indicators such as brain lesions evaluated by MRI [42]. Because of the effects that stress has in neuronal, hormonal and vascular systems, the mechanisms that might link stress with altered course of MS might be multifactorial and associated with the immune responses. With this regard, animal studies reported on the association of stress and disturbed composition of the gut microbiome, by mechanisms linked to the gut\u2013brain axis as suggested by Cryan and colleagues [39].",

Herpes simplex virus, rabies, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, corona virus, measles, canine distemper virus, and HTLV-1 have been implicated in MS over the past years but to date no conclusive association has yet been established [45]. The presence of Herpes simplex virus-6 (HHV-6) or its DNA has been reported in MS lesions and the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients [46], without a direct association being established [47]. Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) is a member of the herpes virus family and along with HHV-6, the worldwide spread and one of the most common human viruses, has also been linked to MS as a disease trigger. Interestingly, the EBV nuclear antigen shares the sequence with the myelin basic protein (MBP), which could explain the induction of MBP-specific encephalitogenic T cells in MS, through a molecular mimicry mechanism [2]. Recent epidemiological studies comparing CNS-derived antibodies against EBV versus other neurotropic viruses in childhood and adults MS onset failed to sufficiently establish that EBV is an etiologic agent of MS, although it may regulate the susceptibility to the disease by modifying the immune responses [48].",

In accordance with the experimental data, the worldwide increase in the incidence of obesity and metabolic diseases such as T2D has been associated with changes in dietary habits [60]. The direct effect of hormones in diet and obesity may also play a role in disease severity. Adipose-derived hormones and adipokines, cytokines produced by adipose cells, might constitute which diet/obesity regulate the immune system. Leptin is a hormone produced by adipose tissue, but also by the stomach, skeletal muscles and placenta. The proportion of fat mass in the tissue regulates leptin production, thatcontrols food intake, influences the autonomic nervous system and regulates the production of other hormones. Mice that are deficient in leptin or in the receptors for leptin are obese and suffer from severe immune system alterations. Interestingly, leptin-deficient mice do not develop EAE [61] while neutralizing leptin in EAE mice reduces disease severity [62]. In MS patients, high levels of leptin are observed in active CNS lesions [63], and in sera and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [64]. Thus, the neuroendocrine system, tightly regulated by nutritional factors and habits, affects significantly the immune system [65]. Fasting for instance, that reduces the levels of circulating leptin, impacts proinflammatory responses and regulates EAE severity [66]. Other hormones of the gut\u2013brain axis have shown modulatory functions in autoimmunity: Neuropeptides, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) affect the induction of Treg cells and migration patterns of immune cells. VIP has been shown to induce FoxP3+ Treg cells and be protective against experimental rheumatoid arthritis [67] and diminish the severity of murine EAE [68]. In mice, diet-induced gut microbiome alterations promote significant changes in the inflammatory responses elicited by the adipose tissue [69]. Moreover, the connection between adipose-derived hormones and the gut microbiome has been seen to influence the fat-gene regulation in the CNS [70]. These effects of the gut microbiome on the neuroendocrine system would then be essential in the regulation of inflammation and disease severity.",

Westernized diet increases the relative abundance of Firmicutes and reduces Bacter\no\ni\ndetes in mice [72]. In humans, obesity was associated with reduced bacterial diversity and reduced abundance of Bacteroidetes\n[71]. When fed with a western diet for eight weeks, GF mice gain significantly less weight and fat mass than conventional mice and are protected against diet-induced glucose intolerance [73]. When conventional mice receive a high-fat diet the levels of plasma free fatty acids increase. Plasma free fatty acids enhancement during HFD consumption and obesity has been associated with inflammatory syndrome and insulin resistance, exacerbating inflammation, and promoting oxidative stress by releasing of reactive oxygen species [74]. These enhanced free fatty acid levels while subjected to high-fat diets are reduced by the treatment with antibiotics against the gut microbiome [75]. In EAE, HFD administration exacerbates EAE severity [76] through the activation of Th17 cells whereas a caloric-restricted diet ameliorates disease [77]. Protection by the administration of caloric-restricted diet to SJL mice was associated with enhanced plasma levels of corticosterone and adiponectin and reduced IL-6 and leptin.",

Microbial processing of fiber generates short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), known to promote strong anti-inflammatory effects in IBD models, and to exacerbate the regulatory function of Treg cells. One of the mechanisms described for the anti-inflammatory effect of SCFA in immune cells is by their interaction with the G-Protein coupled Receptor 43 (GPR43) [84]. Stimulation of GPR43 with SCFA promotes the induction of colonic IL-10-producing FoxP3+ Treg cells. Treatment of GF mice with SCFA restores the unbalanced frequency of colonic Treg cell populations and their function, and promoted the protection against colitis [85]. A fermentation product produced by Clostridia clusters, butyrate, has been also shown to induce colonic Treg cells and reduce the severity of experimental colitis in mice [86]. Remarkably, preliminary studies from Weiner et al. presented at the 2014 Joint ACTRIMS and ECTRIMS meeting suggest and differential in both archaea and butyrate producing organism abundances in the gut microbiota of MS patients versus healthy donors [87]. Gut symbionts are essential for the host organism\u2019s nutrient uptake. Moreover, their processing products are determinant in local and systemic immune-regulation. Thus, diet, considered an environmental risk factor in MS, appears as a central regulator of gut microbes, with known experimental importance in CNS demyelinating inflammation.",

Gut microbes, such as SFB, have been implicated in the induction of potent proinflammatory Th17 cell responses in the gut that ultimately restore the severity of EAE in GF-mice [118]. Altering gut microbiota abundances impacts EAE severity in mice [120], [121]. Oral treatment of mice with antibiotics reduced the EAE severity by diminished pro-inflammatory responses and enhanced FoxP3+ Treg cells that accumulated in mesenteric and cervical lymph nodes (LN). FoxP3+ Treg cells obtained from the cervical LN of mice treated with antibiotics produced elevated IL-10 levels and conferred protection against EAE after adoptive transfer. When mice treated with antibiotics were injected with anti-CD25 antibody to neutralize the effect of CD25+ T cells, a significant increase in the disease severity was observed. However, the disease severity was significantly lower than in EAE mice not subjected to the oral administration of antibiotics but treated with anti-CD25 antibody. These results suggested that other regulatory cell populations that might be important in the protection observed, such as a role for iNKT cells [121] and IL-10 producing CD19+ B cells [113].",

Probiotic Pediococcus acidilactici strain R037 [126] and Lactococcus lactis engineered to produce the Heat shock protein 65 (Hsp65) [127] also reduce the severity of EAE. R037 induced IL-10-producing Trl cells whereas L.\nl\nactis-Hsp65 promoted inducible Treg cells and Latency-associated peptide (LAP)+ CD4+ Treg cells expressing the membrane-bound TGF-\u03b2. A clinical trial in RRMS using probiotics associated with disease protection in EAE is currently underway (Weiner et al., personal communication).",

The presence or absence of the polysaccharide determines the protective or pathogenic outcome of B. fragilis in EAE [133]. A strain of B. fragilis deficient in the production of PSA restores the susceptibility of EAE in mice previously treated with antibiotics, whereas mice recolonized with the intact strain of B. fragilis remain protected. PSA determined the cytokine profile of colonized mice and the conversion of effector CD4+ T cells into IL-10 producing Treg cells in vitro. In mice colonized with PSA-deficient B. fragilis enhanced levels of systemic IL-17 and IL-6, and reduced IL-10 production were observed when compared to mice colonized with intact B. fragilis. Moreover, FoxP3+\n Treg cells converted in vitro from CD4+FoxP3\u2212cells obtained from mice recolonized with PSA-producing B. fragilis produced enhanced levels of IL-10 and induced EAE protection after adoptive transfer. The production of suppressive IL-10 producing FoxP3+\n Treg cells by outer membrane vesicles (OMV) released by PSA-producing B. fragilis was also documented, in processes dependent on TLR2 signaling and not found when OMV\u2019s were isolated from B. fragilis deficient in the production of PSA [134].",

            "text": "In EAE, prophylactic and therapeutic protection in SJL/J and C57BL/6 was achieved by the oral treatment with a highly purified preparation of PSA [102], [128], [132]. PSA promoted a significant accumulation of CD103+ dendritic cells and FoxP3+ Treg cells in the cervical LN of EAE mice, but not in non-EAE animals subjected to treatment, suggesting that an inflammatory stimulus might be required in order for PSA to promote an immunological shift [133]. PSA induced an enhanced regulatory function of CD103+ dendritic cells. EAE protection by PSA was completely abrogated in IL-10 deficient mice. Recently, it has been shown that gut-derived plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) play a significant role in the immunomodulatory effects of PSA-producing B. fragilis\n[132]. PSA recognition by dendritic cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in mice appear to be TLR2 dependent [102], [135]. Recently, our laboratory has demonstrated that PSA promotes the expansion of a CD39+ Treg population through TLR2 activation [102]. Oral treatment with PSA promotes the acquisition of a CD39+ phenotype in CD4+\n T cells that, independent of FoxP3 expression have an exacerbated regulatory phenotype with high levels of IL-10 produced. The role of CD39 in the protection conferred by PSA was confirmed when CD39 deficient mice remained unprotected to sub-optimal EAE after treatment. Moreover, PSA promotes an enhanced migratory phenotype in CD39+ Treg cells with elevated levels of CCR5, CCR6, and CXCR3 [103], and adhesion molecules such as CD49b and CD29 [102]. In vitro, CD39+ Treg cells from PSA-treated EAE mice migrated more efficiently towards inflamed EAE CNS tissue, and a significant accumulation of CD39+ Treg cells were observed in EAE mice treated with PSA when compared to untreated EAE mice [103].",
