The child with bacterial tracheitis usually has had a similar background illness and then has sudden onset of high fever, toxicity, and rapid progression to airway obstruction. The young child with retropharyngeal abscess or adolescent with peritonsillar abscess has less stridor but refuses to swallow and has a muffled voice, reluctance to move the neck, and a guarded posture to maximize oropharyngeal airway patency. Trismus is an expected and useful finding in patients with peritonsillar abscess and some lateral pharyngeal space infections of odontogenic origin.38 Epiglottitis and supraglottitis cause the patient to guard anxiously in a sitting posture with arms back, jaw forward, and chin raised (i.e., sniffing position) to maximize lift of the epiglottis away from the airway. In contrast, subglottic, tracheal obstruction cannot be lessened by position; patients with laryngotracheitis or bacterial tracheitis thrash about with the anxiety of suffocation.",
