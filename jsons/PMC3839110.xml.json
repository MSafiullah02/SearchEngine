            "text": "NoVs belong to the Caliciviridae family, a group of nonenveloped, icosahedral viruses with a single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome [8]. These viruses are highly diverse and are currently divided into 5 genogroups [9]. Genogroups I, II and IV contain human strains. Each genogroup is further subdivided into genotypes based upon analyses of the amino acid sequence of the major capsid protein, VP1. Other genotyping systems based upon shorter sequences [10] or analysis of the polymerase gene [11\u2022] have also been described. New strains and genogroups infecting animals also have been described [12]. NoV infection causes gastroenteritis that is characterized by vomiting and diarrhea [13\u2022\u2022]. The prevalence of vomiting along with the short incubation period (1\u20132 days) and short clinical illness (1\u20133 days) has been used epidemiologically to identify probable outbreaks of NoV-associated gastroenteritis [14, 15]. The infectious dose 50% has been estimated to be as low as fewer than 20 virions [16]. NoVs bind to histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), phylogenetically highly conserved complex glycans present on many different cell types and proposed as an attachment factor necessary to initiate infection in people [17\u2022\u2022, 18, 19].",

When a number of different virus strains are detected in patients, association of the infection with shellfish consumption can be difficult if only a few stools from an outbreak are collected. Thus, it is essential to collect as many stool samples as possible from affected individuals so that all strains that may be present can be identified. It is also important to rapidly identify the outbreak in order to trace the oyster production and to quickly collect the samples related to the outbreak. These data can be used with collected epidemiological data to fully understand the role played by shellfish in the outbreak.",

The frequency of each genogroup detected in shellfish-related outbreaks is clearly distinct from that of other NoV outbreaks. GI strains are more frequently encountered in shellfish-related outbreaks, and the GII.4 genotype is not as dominant (Figure 1\n). Among GI NoVs, the most frequently reported genotype is GI.1, followed by GI.4 and GI.2 (Figure 1). Among GII NoVs, the GII.4 genotype is the most frequently reported from both stool and shellfish samples. The GII.b variant was reported four times in patient's stool from oyster-related outbreaks, but confirmed in shellfish only once. Its frequent involvement in human to human outbreaks raises the possibility of another source of infection for these individuals involved in the alleged shellfish-related outbreaks [28\u2022, 29].",

For example, in a laboratory-based study there was only a 7% decrease in the levels of bioaccumulated Norwalk virus compared to a 95% reduction in bacterial levels following 48 hours of depuration [33]. In another study, a GII.6 NoV persisted for at least 10 days under depuration conditions while a feline calicivirus was promptly eliminated [34]. A third study reported that, after a contaminating event in a French production area, the percentage of samples positive for GI and GII NoVs, respectively, were 59% and 70%. The prevalence decreased to 41% and 17%, respectively, after 4 weeks, suggesting a greater persistence in oyster tissues of GI NoVs compared to GII strains [35].",

Using immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that NoV VLPs specifically bind to glycans of Crassostrea gigas oyster tissues, and that strain-specific variation in binding occurs. GI.1 NoVs bind to the midgut and digestive diverticula but not to gills or mantle, whereas GII.3 and GII.4 NoVs bind to all of these tissues. Human saliva from type A and O secretors, but not of type B secretors, inhibited binding of the GI.1 Norwalk VLPs, in accordance with the strain HBGA binding specificity. In addition, introduction of a mutation in the virus-like particles (VLPs) glycan-binding site that abrogates glycan binding was sufficient to eliminate binding to oyster tissues, demonstrating specificity of the binding [36]. Binding was also inhibited by a lectin and anti-blood group A antibodies, indicating that the GI.1 NoV binds to C. gigas as well as Crassostrea virginica oyster tissues though an A-like antigen [37]. The A-like antigen is also implicated in the binding of GII.3 and GII.4 strains to oyster digestive tissues. Binding of these GII strains to the oyster's gills and mantle occurs through a sialic acid residue [38\u2022].",

            "text": "The influence of ligand expression on NoV binding to oyster tissues was first demonstrated using VLPs. GI.1 VLPs were very efficiently bioaccumulated by C. gigas oysters and were detected by immunohistochemistry even at a low level of exposure, whereas a mutant VLP that was unable to recognize the A-like antigen was only detected in oyster tissues at a thousand fold higher concentration [36]. These results were confirmed using a GI.1-positive stool that bioaccumulated very efficiently in a dose-dependant manner. When these experiments were performed at different times of the year, there was a clear seasonal impact on bioaccumulation efficiency that paralleled expression of the HBGA ligand in oyster digestive tissue [38]. The quantitative approach also showed that the GI.1 NoV directly accumulates in digestive tissues with negligible concentration in other tissues. Performing bioaccumulation using two GII NoV positive stools (one stool positive with a GII.4 and one with a GII.3 strain) led to very different results. These two strains bound to digestive tissues, gills and mantle with a similar pattern [39\u2022]. The GII.4 strain, as well as GII.4 VLPs, was bioaccumulated at very low levels, although they were found in a number of tissues as also reported by others [40, 41]. In contrast, the GII.3 strain was efficiently bioaccumulated, although less well than the GI.1 strain, with a transient retention in the gills likely due to binding to sialic acid [39]. In contrast to the findings with the GI.1 strain, no seasonal impact was observed in the bioaccumulation of the two GII NoVs or of the sialic acid containing ligand present in all tissues. Our interpretation of these data is that the GI.1 strain is efficiently accumulated and retained through an HBGA A-like ligand present in the gut. GII strains are less well accumulated because of a sialic acid containing ligand expressed in all tissues that contributes to their retention in the gills and leads to their destruction (or elimination) by an unknown mechanism. The latter process would be more efficient in the case of a GII.4 than of a GII.3 strain.",

Thus, concentrations of GI and GII NoVs in waters collected during a year were compared to concentrations in oyster digestive tissues. As expected, much higher concentrations of GII NoVs than of GI were detected in waters. GI NoVs were concentrated to a greater degree than GII strains, with GI viruses requiring 30 viral RNA copies/L water to bioaccumulate 1 viral RNA copy/g oyster tissue compared to GII viruses that required \u223c1200 viral copies/L of water to observe 1 viral copy per gram of oyster tissue. These data provide additional evidence for the specific selection and persistence of GI NoVs in oysters. This field study was conducted in an area with a large amount of cattle breeding. Bovine NoVs (GIII) were detected in 14% of water samples at high levels, but only one shellfish sample contained a GIII NoV strain [43]. The \u03b1Gal HBGA epitope, identified as the virus-specific glycan ligand in bovine tissues [44], was absent from oyster tissues, potentially explaining the poor bioaccumulation efficiency observed for GIII NoV strains.",

Ligands that facilitate bioaccumulation (the A-like antigen) or that contribute to the elimination of the virus (the sialic acid-containing ligand) may both influence NoV accumulation and survival in oysters (Figure 2\n). For a long time, oysters were believed to act as filters or ionic traps, passively concentrating particles. However, this is clearly not the case for NoVs, especially for NoV GI.1 that is more actively and efficiently concentrated than GII strains.
