The nature of the problem can be discussed, and submission of correct specimens needed to expedite the diagnosis can be assured. Provision of a clinical history, whether given by telephone or written, is an important step in the diagnostic process. The following helpful information may be included in the clinical history:1.Name, address, and phone numbers of both the swine producer and the attending veterinarian2.Total number of animals in the affected group3.Number of animals that are currently ill4.Number of animals that have died5.Clinical signs observed6.Lesions observed in necropsied animals7.Age and weight of affected animals8.Duration of the problem, date of onset9.Breed of animals affected10.Immunizations11.Treatments administered, response12.Recent additions to herd; exposure to wildlife and other domestic species13.Environmental factors (housing, confinement or pasture, water source, etc.)14.Feeding programs, nutrient levels, feed additives15.Parasite control (internal and external): drugs and chemicals used, how often?16.Information from management records (breeding dates, conception rates, farrowing interval, feed efficiency, rate of gain, etc.)17.Tentative diagnosis\n",

A live, untreated pig with representative clinical signs is usually the specimen of choice for laboratory analysis. However, it may be more expedient for the practitioner to collect specimens during a field necropsy, or from live animals, and send them to the laboratory via an acceptable mode of transportation. The following equipment and supplies are designed for use in performing necropsies and collecting laboratory specimens:Be certain that specimens collected are representative of the systems that appear to be involved in the disease process. Be sure that the size of samples is adequate (100 to 300 gm). Excess material can always be discarded, but it is difficult to retrieve samples if they are not collected initially.",

Select samples of organ tissues (lung, liver, spleen, tonsil, lymph nodes, and so forth) first, before incising the gastrointestinal tract. Individual samples should be placed in separate containers (plastic bag). Representative sections of the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, and so forth) should also be placed in separate containers. Submission of the brain is important, especially in cases in which there are signs referable to the central nervous system. In most cases the head can be removed from the carcass, packaged, and sent intact along with other specimens. If the head is sent in this manner, the brain, ears, lymph nodes, tonsillar tissue, nasal turbinates, and other organs will be available for examination by laboratory personnel.",

Contaminated feed may be completely consumed and unavailable for analysis when an outbreak of poisoning occurs. This may also occur in cases of chronic toxicosis (such as ingestion of mycotoxins and anticoagulant compounds for long periods) and nutrition-related problems resulting from mistakes in mixing and the like. To insure the availability of proper specimens, routine periodic collection and storage of feed samples and/or individual ingredients of mixed feeds for possible future analysis are warranted. The following procedure for obtaining feed samples for mycotoxin analysis has been suggested.14 Sampling is most effective if small samples are taken at intervals from a moving stream of grain. If possible, the recommended quantity for a composite sample from which such sampling is to be performed should be 10 lb (4.54 kg). Probe sampling is most effective when performed soon after grain has been blended. Samples should be dry for transport and storage (dried at 80 to 90\u00b0C for about 30 hours as soon as possible after collection). If fungal culture is to be performed, feed samples should be dried at 60\u00b0C for 6 to 12 hours. Dried samples should be placed in cloth or paper bags.
