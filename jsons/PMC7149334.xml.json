However, working conditions are still far from being acceptable, let alone healthy, in all areas of the world. In many poorer countries, considerable numbers of workers are exposed to serious hazards associated with underground mining, various types of industry (metal, textile, wood, food, electronics, etc.), construction, and agriculture. In industrially advanced countries, occupational lung diseases still occur as a consequence of working conditions of the past, but they also continue to occur, because occupational risks are still present in many jobs and novel risks emerge with the advent of new technologies.",

Exact figures of the incidence and prevalence of occupational lung disorders are often not available, even in countries where government agencies exist for reporting and compensating occupational diseases. This is due, in varying proportions, to legal and administrative restrictions in the eligibility for compensation, to a lack of obligation or incentive to notify occupational diseases, and to insufficient awareness, by physicians, of the possible occupational etiology of diseases in general. Thus, underreporting of occupational diseases is most likely to occur for pensioners, who are no longer at work, but whose condition may well be due to their previous job. However, even in working people, diagnoses of occupational disease, such as occupational asthma, are often missed for a variety of reasons. In various countries, schemes have been created for the voluntary reporting of occupational respiratory diseases by pneumologists and/or occupational physicians, for example, the Surveillance of Work Related and Occupational Respiratory Disease (SWORD) system in the UK or the Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR) Program, initiated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the US.",

Indeed, occupational respiratory diseases are not restricted to a limited range of highly specific occupational diseases, such as silicosis or asbestosis. Most common respiratory diseases, such as bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bronchopulmonary cancer, are caused by a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors, including occupational exposures. Thus, even though an occupational etiology is often difficult to substantiate and document in individual patients, the attributable fraction of occupational factors in mortality and morbidity from respiratory diseases is far from being negligible.",

Established carcinogenic processes for the lung include coke production and coal gasification (possibly related to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), iron and steel founding, paint manufacture and painting.
