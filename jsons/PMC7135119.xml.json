Several studies indicated that the most probable basic reproductive number (R0) is between two and four for the coronavirus (meaning that each infectious individual may directly generate two to four others)1. However, some estimates suggested R0 higher than four with confidence intervals that reach values close to eight2,7. A reproductive number higher than one implies a progressive increase in cases, which translates into epidemics. Therefore, the reduction in this value must guide preventive strategies towards transmission control. In this study, we applied some simple calculations to translate the transmissibility measures into goals for contact rate reduction to support preventive recommendations during the coronavirus pandemic.",

Considering this, we represented the relationship between the baseline R0 of identifiable cases and the minimum necessary reduction in their contact rate to decrease that reproductive number to less than one (solid line in the figure). Additionally, we represented the minimum contact-rate reduction that should be concomitantly adopted by the undetectable infection cases to achieve the same goal (dotted line). According to these functions, even in a more optimistic scenario, for example, with a R0 of 4, contact rate should be reduced by at least 75% and 55% for symptomatic and asymptomatic people, respectively (Figure).",
