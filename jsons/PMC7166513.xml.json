Events such as the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, H5N1 avian influenza, Rift valley fever, foot and mouth disease and Crimean\u2013Congo haemorrhagic fever virus in Europe and, recently, Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa are just a few examples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. There are multiple causes of these epidemics, including factors such as increased population mobility, trade globalization and climate change potentially affecting the geographical distribution of viral vectors 7, 8. The potential for bioterrorism through the deliberate release of an infectious agent in an area not previously affected has been raised and adds a further dimension to the emergence of infectious disease and its control. Zoonotic diseases caused by microorganisms whose principal reservoirs are wild and domestic animals are a leading cause of death and disease. In the past 60 years, more than 50% of emerging infectious diseases in humans have originated from zoonoses 9. The zoonotic infection arena contains several billion humans, a growing number of domestic animals and many wild animals and vectors, which contribute to a large number of interactions between different players and zoonotic infections. Complex interactions between epidemiological, ecological and social processes will promote the emergence and transmission of zoonotic diseases. The latest outbreak of EVD highlights the complexity of the interface between the elements mentioned above for zoonotic diseases. In this review, several crucial questions raised during the current outbreak will be discussed, such as: why EVD outbreaks occur in West Africa, far away from the endemic area; why this outbreak has occurred now; and which factors have contributed to the current widespread transmission of EVD, in contrast to all previous known outbreaks. In addition, the most promising candidate treatments will be summarized.",

These viruses are filamentous (as indicated by their name, derived from the Latin filum meaning \u2018thread\u2019).

            "text": "At present, Ebola Virus and Marburg virus are the only two recognized genera of the family Filoviridae. Lloviu virus (LLOV) can be classified as a distinct genus, Lloviu, with one species, Lloviu cuevavirus. LLOV was recently detected in Schreiber's long\u2010fingered bats (Miniopterus schreibersii Kuhl 1817), and phylogenetic analyses have demonstrated that LLOV is distant from both Marburg virus and EBOV 14, 15. However, this virus has not yet been isolated. The genus Ebola virus (EBOV) contains the following species: Ebola virus, previously Ebola Zaire, Sudan Ebola virus, Reston Ebola virus, Ta\u00ef Forest Ebola virus (formerly C\u00f4te d'Ivoire Ebola virus) and Bundibugyo Ebola virus 14, 15. Within the genus Marburg virus, there is a single species, Marburg virus (formerly Lake Victoria Marburg virus), which consists of two very divergent \u2018viruses\u2019, Marburg virus and Ravn virus, which are approximately 20% divergent at the genetic level 14, 15, 16. Of interest, this is in contrast to the known diversity for EBOV species, with a nucleotide difference between sequences of only 2.7%, 5.2% and 4.5% for EBOV, Sudan Ebola virus and Reston Ebola virus, respectively 16, 17. Classification of the Filoviridae family will most probably continue to develop as further information becomes available through genome sequencing. Phylogenetic studies have been applied to estimate the age of filoviruses. The estimates of common ancestor age range from thousands to millions of years 18, 19, which indicates that these studies should be repeated using novel techniques and increased sample size to obtain more consistent estimates of the age of filoviruses. Recent studies of almost 100 whole\u2010genome sequences using Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analyses indicate nucleotide substitutions/site/year for different viruses ranging from 0.46 \u00d7 10\u22124 for Sudan Ebola virus to 8.21 \u00d710\u22124 for Reston Ebola virus. Studies by Carroll et al. 16 estimated recent common ancestry (approximately 50 years ago) for both Reston Ebola virus and EBOV.",

            "text": "The filovirus genome is approximately 19 kb in length. Filoviruses express seven different proteins 20: nucleoprotein (NP), glycoprotein (GP), RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and the structural proteins virus protein (VP)24, VP30, VP35 and VP40. In addition, EBOV is able to express a truncated soluble GP through RNA editing and small soluble GP, which are secreted from the host cell 20, 21. The surfaces of the viral membranes are spiked with GP trimers. These trimers are formed from GP1 and GP2 (product of cleavage of precursor GP). The GP trimers mediate receptor binding and are the target for neutralizing antibodies. GP spikes, which embed on the virion surface, mediate virus entry 22, 23. GP1 contains an excessively O\u2010linked glycosylated mucin\u2010like domain and a heavily N\u2010linked glycosylated glycan cap domain, and these exterior domains are responsible for binding to a variety of host cell surface factors, as well as covering the receptor\u2010binding domain under them 24. NP and VP30 are required for RNA encapsidation 25, 26. However, it has also been suggested that VP30 may act as a viral transcription activator 27, 28. VP35 links NPs with the viral RdRP to construct the viral RNA synthesis complex for transcription and genome replication 29. The VP35 protein is also known to interfere with interferon induction in both Marburg virus and EBOV 30, 31. The matrix proteins VP40 and VP24 play essential roles in later steps of the replication cycle, such as assembly and budding 32, 33, 34. VP 24 may also act as an interferon antagonist 35, 36. It has been demonstrated that different forms of Ebola GPs can be released from infected cells and that these secreted GPs may activate noninfected dendritic cells and macrophages, causing massive release of pro\u2010 and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines and thereby affecting vascular permeability 37. These GPs thus contribute to high virus pathogenicity. As mentioned above, EBOV is also able to express a truncated soluble GP, which contributes to a mechanism of host immune system evasion through absorption of antibodies and interference with antibody\u2010mediated clearance 21, 38, 39, 40.",

Since then, there have been multiple EBOV transmission events 41, 42 and several EVD outbreaks 43, 44. In August 2014, the largest, most sustained and most widespread EVD outbreak in history became apparent and was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO was notified of the outbreak in March 2014 45, after a febrile illness cluster with high case fatality rate in the area of Gueckedou, Guinea. This attracted international attention and was subsequently identified as the viral zoonosis EBOV. Sequencing data showed that the 2014 outbreak in West Africa was due to infection with a strain of EBOV that differed from the viral strains identified in earlier outbreaks 45.",

His case became the starting point source for person\u2010to\u2010person spread of EVD into the population in several West African countries. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been most affected, and these countries continue to report new cases. Since the beginning of this current outbreak, EBOV has infected 24 666 individuals and has caused 10 179 deaths, according to a WHO report issued on 18 March 2015 48 (Fig. 1). However, the exact number of cases is difficult to determine, and the magnitude of the outbreak is believed to have been significantly under estimated. One case in Senegal was a traveller from Guinea, and a small number of cases in Nigeria and Mali originated from Liberia and Guinea, respectively. All these countries have since been declared free from EVD, largely as a result of rigorous control measures. There have also been a very few cases of EVD amongst travellers returning to Western Europe and the USA.",

After a sudden onset of fever, vomiting, chills, myalgia and diarrhoea, the disease can evolve into a severe state with a rapid clinical decline. This disease phase is characterized by multisystem involvement and includes systemic, gastrointestinal, respiratory, vascular and neurological symptoms (Table 1). Haemorrhagic manifestations include petechiae, ecchymosis and mucosal haemorrhages. In later stages, patients demonstrate shock, convulsions and severe metabolic disturbances 20, 50. Patients with fatal disease develop clinical signs early during infection and die typically between day 6 and 16 with hypovolaemic shock and multi\u2010organ failure. Haemorrhages can be severe but are only present in fewer than half of all patients and in the current outbreaks have been observed in less than 30% of patients.

More recent experiments have shown that inhalation of less than 10 infectious particles of EBOV is sufficient to cause lethal disease in NHPs 59. However, it is important to note that these studies do not address the question of whether EBOV is aerosolized naturally. Direct contact with body fluids from patients with EVD is the most likely way of transmitting EBOV. The evidence from previous and current outbreaks, epidemiological data and animal experiments all clearly demonstrate that contact with EBOV\u2010infected fluids can lead to infection. Despite strong evidence to suggest that contact with body fluids is the route of EBOV transmission, it remains unclear when (i.e. how long postdisease onset) and which (e.g. sweat and tears) fluids contain infectious virus. In previous studies, EBOV has been isolated from blood, saliva, breast milk and semen 60, whereas only viral RNA has been detected in sweat, tears, faeces and skin, rectal and vaginal swabs. It remains unclear how much infectious virus is secreted in different body fluids at different periods postdisease onset.

However, the outbreak was not identified until March 2014 45, which enabled several transmission chains to advance in the region and to cross its borders. A number of factors impede the early identification of EVD outbreaks in Africa in general and in West Africa in particular. First, only a very few EVD outbreaks have occurred in Africa (East and Central Africa) since the first outbreak was identified in 1976, so awareness of the disease tends to be low. In addition, some areas at risk of EVD have not yet experienced an outbreak, which has strongly limited community\u2010level knowledge of the disease 63. Secondly, the early symptoms of EVD are nonspecific 64, which increases the likelihood of misdiagnosis. Thirdly, there is a lack of diagnostic testing in low\u2010income countries. Fourthly, there is a lack of epidemiological monitoring for the timely identification of case clusters.",

Therefore, these factors have probably had a key role in the current EVD outbreak. In particular, cultural practices involving touching and washing the body of the deceased contribute to the dissemination of the EBOV. The associated potential for transmission to neighbouring and distant areas via exposed funeral attendants can facilitate the development of major epidemics 66. Moreover, the lack of prior experience and knowledge of the disease can lead communities to deny its existence and to associate illness with witchcraft or an alleged government conspiracy to gain control of the population or attract resources from the international community 67. For instance, during the ongoing epidemic in West Africa, a group of individuals looted equipment and potentially contaminated materials from an isolation facility in a quarantined neighbourhood. Finally, the stigma carried by EVD survivors and the family members of EVD victims could exacerbate disease spread. In particular, uninformed families tend to hide relatives and friends infected with EVD, to avoid being shunned by their own communities, which enhances transmission rates. The problem is compounded by the high case fatality ratio of EVD, which leads misinformed communities to associate case isolation with a death sentence.",

This treatment led to the survival of seven of these patients, a significantly improved survival rate compared with the average fatality rate of 80% in this particular outbreak 68. However, it should be noted that these patients also received supportive treatment, and therefore, it is impossible to determine whether the serum transfusion was the crucial factor for patient survival 68. The WHO has stated that blood or plasma transfusions from convalescent patients may be used for treatment of patients infected with EBOV in the current outbreak 69. However, the use of transfusion therapy is complicated due to: (i) limited/nonexistent laboratory infrastructure, (ii) lack of resources for safe collection and screening of blood from convalescent patients 70 and (iii) the requirement for a blood type match between donor and recipient.

These molecules inhibit viral replication by recognizing the specific single\u2010stranded RNA or DNA of viruses and binding with them to form stable complexes 88. The EBOV\u2010specific PMO drug AVI\u20106002 is a mixture of positively charged PMOs targeting mRNA sequences of VP24 and VP35. Both TKM\u2010Ebola and AVI\u20106002 have demonstrated promising in vitro and in vivo effects. However, there are two major issues to consider: (i) the mutation rate at the nucleic acid level is usually high for RNA viruses and this can lead to problems regarding genetic variation in the virus for antisense oligonucleotide\u2010based drugs and (ii) both these molecules should be delivered into the cytoplasm more efficiently to reduce drug dosage and frequency.",

Initial studies using recombinant human adenovirus serotype 5 have generated promising results in animal models.

In a recent trial in chimpanzees, pre\u2010exposure prophylaxis with cAd3 resulted in 100% protection. However, cAd3 has not yet been studied as a postexposure prophylaxis for EVD infection.",
