The Coronavirinae subfamily consists of three genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, and gammacoronavirus. PEDv is an enveloped alphacoronavirus encoded by a 28 kilobase single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome (Song and Park 2012) . Coronaviruses have the largest known RNA genomes of all viruses (King 2011) . The PEDv genome has seven open reading frames (ORFs), which code for three non-structural polyproteins, and four structural proteins [spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) ]. These open reading frames are flanked by a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail (Figs. 1 and 2) (Song and Park 2012) . The ORFs encoding the non-structural proteins consist of two overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, encoding two polyproteins. These polyproteins are processed by three virus-encoded proteases, a 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) and two papain-like proteinases (PLP) which results in 16 non-structural proteins required for genome replication and mRNA transcription (John et al. 2016; Prentice et al. 2004 ). The accessory protein ORF3 is a potassium ion channel, but its role is not well defined (Wang et al. 2012) . Reports on transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), another alphacoronavirus, indicate that S and E are only present in the virion in small quantities, with E estimated to occur 20 times in a virion (Godet et al. 1992) . N and M occur in higher numbers, at a ratio of 1N:3M (King 2011) . A recent study examining mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, a betacoronavirus), severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV, a betacoronavirus), and feline coronavirus (FCoV, an alphacoronavirus), has determined that coronaviruses have approximately 1100 M dimers, 90 S trimers, and N proteins in a ratio from 3M:1N to 1M:1N (Neuman et al. 2011) .

Work has been done to produce S or S epitopes in Escherichia coli (Van Noi and Chung 2017), Lactobacillus casei (Ge et al. 2012) , and via the Orf virus as a vaccine delivery vector (Hain et al. 2016 ). However, most recombinant PEDv S production has occurred in plants, with all of these plants producing S-COE. The protein yield has varied widely, as has the plant host utilized. Historically, tobacco has been the most established and developed platform for high-yield plant-based recombinant protein production (Conley et al. 2011 ). As such, it follows suit that five of the fourteen reports of S-COE production were carried out using tobacco ( Table 1) . Four of the reports expressed S-COE in a stable transgenic line, with yields between 0.1% of TSP (Kang et al. 2005b ) and 2.1% of TSP, depending on codon optimization (Kang et al. 2005a) , while one reported transient production at 5% of TSP (Kang et al. 2004 ). Many of the alternative plant choices resulted in yields that were either not quantified, or very low, despite often using the same promoters and enhancers as the tobacco studies. Like the tobacco studies, a double-enhanced 35S (2x35S) cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) promoter was used in carrot and potato The use of fusion proteins, particularly the heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit of Escherichia coli (LTB), have recently gained popularity in subunit vaccine design, and have been utilized in the production of S-COE. Three studies have expressed such fusions in rice, which has shown promise in reaching equivalent accumulation levels as tobacco. Rice was used to express S-COE both in the endosperm and in calli. While accumulation levels in the calli using the rice a-amylase 3D promoter (RAmy3D) only reached 0.083% for a S-COE-M cell-targeting ligand (Co1) fusion (Huy et al. 2012) , accumulation levels in the endosperm for LTB-S-COE using the wheat high molecular weight glutenin subunit Bx17 endosperm-specific promoter (HMW-Bx17-p) and rice actin first intron (Act1-I) reached 1.3 and 1.9% (Oszvald et al. 2007; Tam\u00e1s 2010) .

The ability to vaccinate orally through feeding plant tissue is important as (Song et al. 2007 ) demonstrated that oral vaccination was more effective than injection for their PEDv vaccine. When comparing oral to intramuscular administration of their attenuated virus vaccine, Song et al. found that more IgA's were produced by orally vaccinated pigs, and that the mortality rate for this group was 13% in comparison to 60% for the intramuscular group. Current vaccines on the market are also either based on S, which is prone to mutations, or are killed or live attenuated vaccines. Live attenuated vaccines present risks, as they can potentially mutate and become pathogenic again, and allow for genome segment re-assortment on farms-one Chinese PEDv strain is thought to have evolved from a live attenuated vaccine (Chen et al. 2010) . Inactivated vaccines, in comparison, are safer, but have a high cost of production, and present concerns over the reliability of inactivation methods (Calvo-Pinilla et al. 2014 ). Both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines rule out the possibility of using \"distinguish infected from vaccinated animals\" (DIVA) assays, as they contain the entire virus. As such, the market has a need of an effective subunit vaccine based on the current infectious strains. Further research on current plant-made candidates could prove to fill this need.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 175, "end": 192, "text": "(Song et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 916, "end": 934, "text": "(Chen et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1087, "end": 1113, "text": "(Calvo-Pinilla et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Existing Commercial Vaccines"}, {"text": "While proof of concept studies show that S-COE can be produced in plants, many of these studies show poor yields. Generally, even when higher yields are reported, the push forward to testing the immunogenicity of these vaccine candidates does not occur.

The first was incomplete, as it did not test whether the mounted immune response was virus-neutralizing (Huy et al. 2012) . The other candidate that successfully took steps to test immunogenicity was the vaccine candidate produced by (Bae et al. 2003) . However, while the immune response in mice inhibited PEDv plaque formation by 49.7% in comparison to controls, complete immunity was not achieved (Bae et al. 2003) .
