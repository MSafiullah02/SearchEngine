The germination of scleiotia in soil is specifically triggered by Allium species (Coley-Smith, 1960; Coley-Smith & Holt, 1966) , little or no germination taking place in the absence of these plants. The effect of Allium species results from the exudation from their roots of non-volatile alkyl-and alkenyl-cysteine sulphoxides (Coley-Smith & Cooke, 1971) which are metabolized by the soil microflora to yield volatfle sulphurcontaining compounds which activate the dormant sclerotia (Coley-Smith & King, 1969; King & Coley-Smith,, 1969) . Amongst the volatile sulphur compounds tested by Coley-Smith & King (1969) 1-propyI ,and 2-propenyl (= ailyl) compounds were very effective stimulants of germination whereas methyl compounds were not.",

The groups proposed by these workers have been slightly modified for convenience of presentation (Table 4) . Species with >50% 1 -propyl + 1 -propenyl radical have been included in Group 1, all species containing the 2-propeny] radical in Group 2 and species with >50% of the methyl radical in Group 3. Some of the species were clearly borderline and two A. carinatum subsp. pulchellum and A. chinense were placed in different groups from the ones in which they were included by Freeman & Wlienham (1975) . It is clear rig-2. Severe spreading infection of roots oi A. neapolitanum accompanied by development of sclerotial initials of S. cepivorum in soO tube. that there is oo absolute distinction between the three groups but they are nevertheless useful for certain purposes. Most of the Group 3 species had low pyruvate levels as well as high methyl contents. With a few exceptions pyruvate levels of Group 1 and particularly of Group 2 species, were higher than those of Group 3. In Group 1 the lowest pyruvate levels occurred in the two leek cultivars (Allium porrum), a feature which is being investigated further. DISCUSSIO'N It is clear from this investigation that although stimulation of germination of sclerotia of S. cepivorum is confined to Allium, members of this genus vary considerably in their stimulatory capacity. The six species which had either weak or no effects on sclerotial germination i.e.. A. aflatunense, A. cristophii, A. karataviense, A. oreophilum, A. rosenbachianum and A. stipitatum, all belonged to Group 3 of Freeman & Whenham (1975) . They weie all characterized by the presence of S-methyl-L- cysteine sulphoxide as their principal flavour and odour precursor. In all six species over 90% of the total flavour precursors present consisted ofthe methyl derivative. In addition they all had a low flavour intensity, as measured by pyruvate analysis. The remaining four species which were assigned to Group 3, A. caemieum, A. chinense, A. flavum and A. sphaerocephaion, possessed considerable stimulatory activity. In these the principal flavour and odour precursor was again S-methyl-L-cysteine sulphoxide but the 1 -propyl and 1 -propenyl derivatives were also present in considerable quantity. The flavour intensity of three of these four species was moderately high but was low in A. sphaero-cephalon. All four species were clearly borderline between Groups 1 and 3 as was^. carinatum suhsp. pulchellum. It appears that amongst Allium species absence of stimulatory activity requires both the presence of the methyl derivative as principal flavour and odour precursor and also a low overall flavour and odour intensity. It is interesting that Coley-Smith & King (1969) who tested many sulphides found methyl compo'Unds were relatively ineffective in stimulating germination whereas 1-propyl and particularly 2propenyl (=allyl) compounds were highly effective.",

Several other species tested are capable of hybridizing with A. cepa or A. fistulosum {McCollum, 1971 {McCollum, , 1974 Vosa, 1976; El-Gadi & Elkington. 1977) .
