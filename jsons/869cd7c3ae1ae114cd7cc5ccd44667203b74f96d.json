Although a relatively small proportion of the total number of animals utilized in biomedical research, nonhuman primates occupy a unique position as the species most closely related to humans, and thus have the potential to provide highly relevant information regarding human health issues. Nonhuman primates are utilized across a wide diversity of research topics and examples are provided including infectious disease, neuroscience, and genomics. Pertinent information relating to ethical issues, species selection, housing, and specific pathogen-free status are provided as an overview of relevant issues associated with selection of nonhuman primate models. Selected references are provided as a reference for more comprehensive information relating to these topics.",

Of over 1.1 million animals 1 (not including rodents, fish, or birds) used in biomedical research annually, less than 0.3% are nonhuman primates. 2 The foundation for this disproportionate significance lies in the quality of information available through nonhuman primate studies. Nonhuman primates are arguably the most applicable animal model to the human condition based on their anatomic, physiological, and genetic similarity to humans. Genetic relatedness with the chimpanzee [Pan (Homo) troglodytes], the most closely related nonhuman primate species, approaches 98%, suggesting a high likelihood of correlation for nonhuman primate studies 3, 4 Other nonhuman primate species, while less related to humans, still demonstrate important similarities and differences, offering an incredible resource for studies spanning a broad spectrum ranging from infectious disease to evolution.",

Nonhuman primates are recognized as having elevated cognitive requirements in addition to standard physiological needs. Strict minimum housing space requirements as well as dietary and environmental regulations are in place through the Animal Welfare Act and subsequent amendments as well as the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. 7, 8 These requirements are enforced through an extensive network of federal, state, and local regulations, scheduled and unscheduled site visits, and oversight by local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC). Use of nonhuman primates, as well as other commonly used laboratory animal species, requires prior justification and approval by the appropriate IACUC to safeguard the appropriate care and use of every animal.",

Nonhuman primates typically provide information very relevant to human application and therefore are highly recommended. Other factors, however, must also be considered in the process. If the biological question can be addressed through the use of lower species or nonanimal resources, current guidelines require use of these alternative means.

It is highly likely that macaques will play a pivotal role in the development of these capabilities. This effort will require development and refinement of new nonhuman primate models to provide the necessary information required prior to implementation of human studies. This area of research emphasizes the highly relevant application of nonhuman primates as a precursor and substitute for human clinical studies.
