One major reason is that free DNA in cytoplasm or blood cannot bring up violent immune response in bat. However free DNA can produce severe inflammations in human mediated by KLRC/KLRD family of natural killer cell receptors, MHC class I genes, and type I interferons, and some DNA sensors,[5], [6] thus \u201ccytokine storm\u201d in human.

Free DNA In COVID-19 patients can be brought up by both injured lung cells, lymphocytes, and other immune cells. More than 60% of COVID-19 patients had lymphopenia,[1], [2], [3] which produced abundant free DNA in these patients. Free DNA is then circulated into many tissues and activated various tissue cells to produce a large amount of cytokines,[5], [6] thus risk for \u201ccytokine storm\u201d. In addition to these cytokines, free DNA can also destroy vascular endothelial cells directly:7\nin vitro study showed it can harm human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The damage of endothelial cells will boost the dysfunctions of multiple organs by cytokine storm, as described as follow. Meanwhile, cytokine storm will also promote the permeability of blood vessels. Level of lymphocytes is thought as the early identification of risk factors for severe COVID-19,[2], [3] while I hypothesized that it was related to free DNA-related cytokine storm and blood vessel damage, which can explain many symptoms of this disease, including some \u201cspecial\u201d symptoms in COVID-19, as shown in Figure 1\n.",

            "text": "Free DNA is relative resistant to the endonuclease action,16 so the free DNA from both dead lung cells and lymphocytes can be accumulated in blood to a certain extent, then induce the damage of COVID-19 patients rapidly and violently. It can explain the following \u201cstrange\u201d phenomenon: first, compared to SARS and MERS, patients with COVID-19 usually had a comparative long interval from disease onset to dyspnoea, but they were suddenly worsening and had some severe symptoms shortly, such as ARDS, admission to mechanical ventilation and to ICU.[1], [2], [3] Importantly, these symptoms (averagely not before day 12 in non-surviors)17 is usually happened when the viral shedding is already decreasing (its peak time at about day 6) in severe COVID-19 patients. It can be easily explained by the accumulation of free DNA in blood. When it is extended to a \u201cthreshold\u201d, significant vessels damage and cytokine storm will be produced. In addition, Guan et al reported that about half of patients have no fever at admission to hospital, but most of them will develop a fever during hospital.2 I thought that the \u201cdelayed fever\u201d was partly due to an increasing level of free DNA, in addition to the amplification of the virus. Third, many clinicians found that some severe COVID-19 patients have experienced two or more \u201cattack\u201d even after viral load was reduced. I thought that some attack was due to direct invasion by the virus, while the others might be due to the cytokine storm or vessel damage induced by free DNA. Most surprisingly, some discharged patients with improved CT results and continuous twice negative tests of nucleic acids, were found to return to positive tests of nucleic acids .18 It implied that the load of virus increased after they were discharged from hospital. This phenomenon is not seen in SARS and MERS. Free DNA is related to the continues activation and use up of immune cells.19 I thought that comparative high level of free DNA in some discharged patients will eventually suppress immune function and cause the amplification of virus.",
