Four major MRV serotypes have been characterized by neutralization assays, and all inhibit hemagglutination: type 1 Lang (T1L), type 2 Jones (T2J), type 3 Dearing (T3D) and type 4 Ndelle (T4N) (Kohl et al., 2012, Attoui et al., 2001a, Attoui et al., 2001b). MRV isolates were obtained from hosts with or without clinical signs of disease, and the virus can infect a broad range of mammals (Dermody et al., 2013). MRVs are ubiquitous mammalian pathogens, infecting nearly all mammalian hosts, including humans and other animal species (Steyer et al., 2013, Decaro et al., 2005, Attoui et al., 2011).",

Infected bats threaten public health because they exist in large populations and travel across wide geographical distances (Wong et al., 2007, Calisher et al., 2006). However, reports on the detection and isolation of orthoreovirus from bats are limited. In 1968, the first orthoreovirus in bats, Nelson Bay virus (NBV), was isolated from the blood of fruit bats in Australia. In 1999, the second bat-borne orthoreovirus, Pulau virus (PulV), was isolated from fruit bat urine collected on Tioman Island, Malaysia. Since then, bat-borne orthoreoviruses have received much attention. Additional orthoreoviruses (MelV, KamV, Xi-River, Broome viruses, Kampar, Sikamat, HK23629/07, RpMRV-YN2012, Cangyuan virus) have been isolated from or detected in bats and in humans who were likely in contact with bats (Chua et al., 2007, Chua et al., 2008, Du et al., 2010, Thalmann et al., 2010, Cheng et al., 2009, Chua et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2015, Hu et al., 2014).",

In this study, we report the characterization of a novel MRV strain (called \u201cB/03\u201d) isolated from healthy, wild short-nosed fruit bats in Guangdong province, China. The whole genome sequence of strain B/03 was determined. Its evolution and evidence of genetic reassortment were analyzed by sequence comparison using phylogenetic analysis.

Thus, surveillance and evaluation of viruses prevalent in wildlife are of special interest. Bats are the natural host reservoir for a number of high-impact zoonotic viruses. More than 200 viruses belonging to 27 families were isolated from or detected in bats. A few of these viruses have been responsible for human disease, including Ebola virus (Leroy et al., 2005), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Ithete et al., 2013), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) (Ge et al., 2013), Nipah and Hendra viruses (Halpin et al., 2000, Marsh et al., 2012). Several bat orthoreovirus isolates have been obtained from bats in recent years (Moratelli and Calisher, 2015, Chua et al., 2007, Pritchard et al., 2006, Du et al., 2010). A novel bat reassortant MRV, RpMRV-YN2012, obtained from least horseshoe bats in China resulted from a reassortment of MRVs known to infect humans and animals (Wang et al., 2015). Six MRV strains were isolated from Hipposideros and Myotis and grouped into MRV serotypes 1, 2, or 3 based on the S1 gene sequence (Yang et al., 2015). Three novel MRVs were isolated from European bats, with rather mild or clinically unapparent infections in their hosts (Kohl et al., 2012). Considering the diversity and wide distribution of bats and the potential for transmission of bat viruses to humans and other animals, continued surveillance of MRVs in all host species is urgently needed. In this study, one strain of MRV, B/03, was isolated by in vitro cell culture from thirty wild short-nosed fruit bat samples from Shaoguan city of China's Guangdong province. The isolate was serially propagated in cell culture and characterized by cell culture CPE, immunofluorescence staining, Electropherotype, EM and entire genome sequencing.",

However, several recent studies have suggested that MRV can cause serious illness and even death in humans and other mammals, characterized by upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea and encephalitis (Tyler et al., 2004, Ouattara et al., 2011). Indeed, the pathogenesis of reovirus infections has been most extensively studied using both suckling and adult mice, and infections lead to systemic viral replication, morbidity, and mortality (Dermody et al., 2013, Doyle et al., 2015, Organ and Rubin, 1998). This study aimed to use BALB/c mice to study MRV B/03 pathogenesis. BALB/c mice were infected by intranasal (i.n.), intracranial (i.c.), intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intragastric (i.g.) inoculation with different doses of B/03 virus. We found that mice are susceptible to MRV B/03 infection by intranasal inoculation. The highest dose of B/03 virus (107 PFU) induced signs of disease on day 5 after infection and resulted in the death of 5 of 10 mice starting at 7 days post-infection. We observed approximately 50% mortality in mice that underwent i.n. inoculation with 107 PFU of B/03 virus. In a previous study, we showed that the MPC/04 strain (isolated from masked palm civets) is pathogenic to four-week-old female BALB/c mice with approximately 70% mortality and pronounced pathological changes in tissues of mice inoculated (i.n.) with 107 PFU (Li et al., 2015). In this study, infection with B/03 virus caused obvious lesions in the lungs due to tissue damage and inflammation associated with alveolar thickening and lymphocytic infiltration, as well as accumulation of cellular debris and distended bronchioles and alveoli. Our study shows that the B/03 strain is pathogenic to BALB/c mice. Additional studies regarding viral replication, pathogenesis and host interactions are needed to better understand the pathogenesis of this virus. These findings parallel those found by others in rats (Gauvin et al., 2013, Morin et al., 1996).",

Viral loads in the lung were higher (100-fold) than those in other tissues, and this observation was associated with the ability of the virus to cause acute respiratory distress. These data are consistent with pathological changes in the lung. Mice in the 107 PFU inoculation group displayed severe acute respiratory symptoms and died starting at day 7 dpi. Our results indicate that B/03 virus replicates to higher levels in the lung than in other organs, a finding that is in agreement with the induction of acute respiratory distress in infected mice. We also provide evidence that these novel MRV strains are pathogenic to mice, leading to lethal respiratory disease.",
