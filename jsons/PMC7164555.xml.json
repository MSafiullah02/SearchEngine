We did not take that approach here; instead, we directly estimated the generation\ntime distribution from 40 source-recipient pairs. These pairs were manually selected according\nto high confidence of direct transmission inferred from publicly available sources at the time\nof writing (March, 2020), and with known time of onset of symptoms for both source and\nrecipient. We combined dates of symptom onset with intervals of exposure for both source and\nrecipient (when available) and the above distribution of incubation times and from these\ninferred the distribution of generation times. The distribution is best described by a Weibull\ndistribution (AIC=148.4, versus 149.9 for gamma and 152.3 for lognormal distribution) with mean\nand median equal to 5.0 days and standard deviation of 1.9 days, shown in the left panel of\nFig. 1.

The 40 probabilities inferred are shown in the right panel of Fig. 1; the mean probability is 37% (95% CI: 27.5% - 45%), which can be\ninterpreted as the fraction of pre-symptomatic transmission events out of pre-symptomatic plus\nsymptomatic transmission events. This mean probability over all pairs approximates our prior,\nbut the bimodal distribution of individual probabilities in Fig.\n1 shows that these are typically far from the prior, i.e., the data are strongly\ninformative.

Our\nestimate of R0 is lower than many previous published estimates, for example (12,28, 29). These studies assumed SARS-like generation times; however, the\nemerging evidence for shorter generation times for COVID-19 implies a smaller R0.\nThis means a smaller fraction of transmissions need to be blocked for sustained epidemic\nsuppression (R < 1). However, it does not mean sustained epidemic suppression will be easier\nto achieve because each individual\u2019s transmissions occur in a shorter window of time\nafter their infection, and a greater fraction of them occurs before the warning sign of\nsymptoms. Specifically, our approaches suggest that between a third and a half of transmissions\noccur from pre-symptomatic individuals. This is in line with estimates of 48% of transmission\nbeing pre-symptomatic in Singapore and 62% in Tianjin, China (30), and 44% in transmission pairs from various countries (31). Our infectiousness model suggests that\nthe total contribution to R0 from pre-symptomatics is 0.9 (0.2 - 1.1), almost enough\nto sustain an epidemic on its own. For SARS, the corresponding estimate was almost zero (9), immediately telling us that different\ncontainment strategies will be needed for COVID-19.",

Digital contact tracing could play a critical\nrole in avoiding or leaving lockdown. We have quantified its expected success and laid out a\nseries of requirements for its ethical implementation. The App we propose offers benefits for\nboth society and individuals, reducing the number of cases and also enabling people to continue\ntheir lives in an informed, safe, and socially responsible way. It offers the potential to\nachieve important public benefits while maximising autonomy. Specific issues exist for groups\nwithin the population that may not be amenable to such an approach, and these could be rapidly\nrefined in policy. Essential workers, such as health care workers, may need separate\narrangements.",
