The most abundant phospholipid in surfactant is dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), which is the main agent responsible for surface tension lowering at the air-liquid interface, probably with the contribution of other lipid compounds, as phosphatidylglycerol [7]. Surfactant proteins (SPs) constitute a mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic components of the surfactant, which contribute to surface tension lowering through specific interactions with DPPC and involvement in surfactant turnover process. Because of its well-known tensioactive properties, exogenous surfactant administration in RDS results in reduction of alveolar opening pressure, increase of lung volume at a certain distending pressure, and stabilization of lung volume during the deflation phases, thus reducing the work of breathing [8, 9].",

However, antioxidant defenses show impaired activity because of developmental arrest of both placental transfer and endogenous production of enzymatic and nonenzymatic compounds, thus leading to the occurrence of a pro-oxidant status [13\u201316]. In fact, when compared to term newborns, preterm newborns present significantly reduced activity of glutathione peroxidase and SOD for several weeks after birth [17] and lower circulating levels of vitamin E and ascorbic acid [13, 14]. Moreover, susceptibility to oxidative stress may be further increased by high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) which are highly sensitive to peroxidation injuries, particularly in the neuronal membranes, and relatively increased free iron release favoring free radicals (FRs) formation [13, 14]. It was also demonstrated that preterm newborns lack the capacity to induce a proper antioxidant enzymatic activity in response to oxidative challenges [18].",

However, the main antioxidant effects of surfactant probably relay on different mechanisms, since surfactant itself shows a consistent antioxidant activity attributable both to enzymatic and nonenzymatic scavenger molecules naturally contained in the mixture. Consequently, exogenous surfactant would be able to abate the local ROS concentration in the alveolar areas, thus directly preventing both local damage and ROS diffusion to the surrounding tissues and vessels [11, 12, 25, 26].",

Basing on the observation that bronchoalveolar lavage of preterm neonates treated with surfactant presented lower levels of pro-oxidant markers than untreated neonates [28], it was demonstrated in the animal model that natural calf lung surfactant contains a measurable amount of SOD and CAT, which have been also demonstrated to exert consistent scavenging activity when incubated with a definite amount of H2O2 [11]. Moreover, endotracheal administration of surfactant also induced a significant increase of SOD content of alveolar type II cells, demonstrating the occurrence of enzyme uptake via liposome during the surfactant recycle process [11]. Therefore, the positive effects of surfactant administration in preterm neonates may be related not only to direct improvement of lung mechanics but also to local antioxidant activity of surfactant and to increased antioxidant potential of alveolar cells. Interestingly, the comparison between natural lung surfactant and a lung surfactant extract containing only 1 % of proteins showed that the latter contains no significant amount of antioxidant enzymes and does not exert any scavenging activity against H2O2 [11]. These data reinforce the concept that surfactant mixtures not containing proper amount of protein compounds, as synthetic surfactants, are inadequate for clinical purpose at present, probably not only because of suboptimal tensoactive properties but also for the lack of enzymes naturally present in lung surfactant.",

Comparing these mixtures, Beractant roughly showed the highest content of SOD per mg of phosholipids, while Calfactant showed the highest content of CAT, but when enzymatic activities were expressed per mL of surfactant, Poractant provided the highest content of SOD while Calfactant was confirmed to contain the highest amount of CAT. Moreover, considering the recommended doses for clinical use, Poractant was shown to provide the major amount of SOD, while Calfactant was proved to contain the major amount of CAT (Table 1). After incubation with different amounts of H2O2, Curosurf showed the highest scavenger activity, except that at the lowest studied concentrations of H2O2 when Beractant exerted the highest scavenger activity. For any concentration of H2O2, Calfactant and Bovactant showed significantly lower scavenger activity vs. Poractant and Beractant (Table 2) [12].\n\n",

According to the \u201csurface-associated reservoir\u201d model, large areas of surfactant layer are folded during the expiration phase, but remain adherent to the monolayer present at the air-liquid interface and extend during inspiration. Plasmalogens, together with cholesterol, were proved to work synergistically with the hydrophobic SP-B and SP-C for the proper formation of the reservoir and the spreading of DPPC and, in the experimental model, plasmalogens addition to surfactant achieved further reduction of surface tension and viscosity in comparison to surfactant alone [8, 25, 29]. Besides surface-active properties, plasmalogens were recently demonstrated to confer consistent antioxidant protection against ultraviolet light-induced lipid peroxidation within cell membranes [30] and also to exert antioxidant functions in low density lipoproteins [31]. The content of plasmalogens has been detailed for Poractant, Beractant, and Bovactant, but not for Calfactant [8, 25], and resulted consistently higher for Poractant than Beractant and Bovactant (Table 1). These results could partially explain the different scavenger performances against H2O2 observed for the natural surfactants, together with the differences in the content of antioxidant enzymes [12].",

As expected, the addition of SOD to Poractant, Beractant, and Bovactant resulted in increased scavenger activities in comparison to the surfactants alone, while the addition of SOD to Calfactant resulted in a paradoxical reduction of its scavenger activity, which was putatively attributed to other mechanisms induced by SOD overexpression, as increased H2O2 production and hydroxyl radical formation. CAT addition to the four surfactants resulted in increased scavenger activity of the surfactants even if it did not reach significance in the case of Beractant. The addition of both SOD and CAT induced a further increase in comparison with SOD or CAT addition alone, suggesting a synergic activity of the two enzymes.",

SP-A and SP-D are two hydrophilic proteins which belong to the family of collectins and were shown to affect several steps of the immune response to several pathogens both in vivo and in vitro [41, 42]. These proteins have to property to bind and aggregate to virus, bacteria, fungi, and endotoxins present in the alveolar spaces, favoring their phagocytosis and killing by cells of the innate immune response, namely, the alveolar macrophages and neutrophil granulocytes. [10, 40]. As a consequence, the transgenic mice model not expressing SP-A and SP-D presents increased susceptibility to lung infections and to the development of severe lung lesions from several pathogens [41, 42]. Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that SP-A downregulate inflammation in presence of LPS suppressing the proinflammatory pathways mediated by NF-kB [43]. On the other hand, SP-A and SP-D downregulate the specific immune response to pathogens, through the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines secretion, as TNF-alpha, and the modulation of lymphocytes proliferation [40].",
