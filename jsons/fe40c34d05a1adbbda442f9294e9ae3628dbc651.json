The increased internet search queries indicated the more people proactively engaged in hand hygiene, which may have had an effect on reducing the speed of COVID-19 outbreak during the following three weeks. Since approximately 19% of the world population washes hands with soap after contact with excreta (9), and environmental contamination by patients with COVID-19 through respiratory droplets and fecal shedding (10) suggests the need for strict adherence to hand hygiene. The significant increase in searches for \"face mask\" revealed general population's anxieties towards COVID-19 and the possible short supply of face masks during periods of a COVID-19 pandemic, despite the evidence that face masks worn by healthy individuals are still controversial in infection prevention (11) . Although current available research supports the possibility that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could be spreads via bioaerosols generated directly by patients' exhalation, face masks seem to be ineffective in preventing the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 from the coughs of patients with COVID-19 to the environment (13).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1121, "end": 1125, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "These findings were consistent with our results that hand hygiene is a more effective strategy than wearing a face mask.

However, the increased google searches for \"wash hands\" would simply indicate people engaged more in hand hygiene. In summary, our findings support the experts' suggestion that even if wearing a face mask is indicated, it is still important to wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds prior to putting on the face mask (14) , and repeating hand hygiene after touching the outer surface of masks (13) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 813, "end": 817, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 889, "end": 893, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We expect that the increase of google searches for \"wash hands\" provide real-time indicators for transmission-reduction policies and population health literacy in the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak.
