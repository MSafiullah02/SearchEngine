In epidemic settings, children 2-10 are the priority target with serogroups A and C typically the priority antigens. Rapid mass vaccination campaigns can contain outbreaks in 2-3 weeks. For immunocompetent patients over 2 years, vaccine efficacy rate is 90% one week after injection. However, duration of immunity may be as little as 2 years in younger children. In some countries, vaccine may also be used with close contacts of sporadic disease cases to prevent secondary cases. Chemoprophylaxis of contacts is not recommended in epidemics, but community education and ready access to health care are essential.",

Pathophysiology Why does this person from this place get this disease at this time? Person Think of new exposure for Pts from non-endemic or developed areas. Think of breakdown in immunity for Pts from endemic or undeveloped areas. For systemic infection, infective dose is a function of immunity and innoculum. immunity relates to host and may be altered by congenital, acquired, or iatrogenic causes innoculum relates to infectious organism and the environment Place Think geographic medicine. Time Think seasonality. Malaria is classic: \u2022 Holo-endemic areas (eg Congo) have an intense level of malaria transmission year-round. Epidemics don't occur unless displacement brings in non-immune populations. Infection may be asymptomatic. Effective partial immunity develops in adults which enables clinical tolerance of infection and protects against serious episodes. Mortality is highest in pedes U5 and pregnant women. \u2022 Hyper-endemic areas (eg W. Africa) have an intense but unstable level of transmission in seasonal peaks when the climatic conditions are favorable. Epidemics occur. Infection is generally symptomatic. Partial immunity fails to develop. Mortality occurs across all age groups.\u2022 Hypo-endemic areas (eg Thai-Burmese border) have a low level of transmission year-round. Epidemics occur. Infection is generally symptomatic. Partial immunity fails to develop. Mortality occurs across all age groups.",

Large, recurring epidemics of meningitis occur in the \"meningitis belt\" of sub-Saharan Africa where over 430 million people live. This belt encompasses 26 countries from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east and as far south as Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Subsaharan Arica has epidemic seasonality. Dry seasons and droughts favor epidemics. Rains stop them. Large regional epidemics, as well as epidemics in displaced populations and refugee camps, have mainly been due to meningococcus serogroup A. Since 2010, extensive use of meningococcal type A conjugate vaccine in the meningitis belt has reduced the incidence and case load of type A epidemics by nearly 60%. In 2016, the most common lab confirmed meningitis isolate was Streptococcus pneumoniae. In non-epidemic settings, Neisseria.meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae account for 80% of all cases of bacterial meningitis.

Early stages of infection, during peaks of fever, and before ABX.Biosafety while sampling? \u2022 Protect yourself (universal precautions, personal protective equipment as needed)\u2022Protect the Pt (disinfect, use single use materials) \u2022 Protect the environment (waste disposal, triple package the specimen) How to sample? \u2022 Collect liquid stool in leakproof container \u2022 Use forceps to immerse swab or filter paper dots in liquid stool \u2022 Place in specimen container with a few drops of sterile saline \u2022 For bloody stool, sample several areas of specimen including blood, mucous, or tissue \u2022 Lumbar puncture in usual way \u2022 Venipuncture in usual way How to prepare the sample? \u2022 Cary Blair* * Semi-solid transport medium, easy to use Place swab with sample in medium to immerse tip of swab. Break off wooden swab handle. Cap tightly. Use with stool and other samples containing non-fragile bacterial pathogens. Inexpensive medium. Long shelf life after preparation (about 1 year at 25 \u25cb C). Can be prepared in advance and pre-positioned at peripheral levels. Biphasic transport medium with agar and broth Pre-warm medium to 25-37 \u25cb C before inoculation. Place 1 cc of specimen in sterile medium for culture. Immediately incubate or hold at 25-37 \u25cb C. Ventilate bottle if >4 days to lab. Place 1 cc of specimen in another sterile vial for cytology, chemistry, and CIE. Refrigerate. More expensive medium.
