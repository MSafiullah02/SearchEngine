In the latter, viral infections including those that commonly are only mildly pathogenic or cause self-limited diseases can lead to protracted infections with chronic viral shedding, to disseminated disease with infection of organs rarely affected in immunocompetent hosts and to severe disease courses with increased mortality (Quan et al., 2010, Wunderli et al., 2011). For instance, human Enterovirus (HEV) and human Rhinovirus (HRV) cause asymptomatic or mild infections in immunocompetent individuals (common cold and rash), while causing more severe diseases in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, and acute febrile illness in young children) (Tapparel et al., 2013). Although often no specific treatment for virus infections is available, accurate discrimination of viral pathogens is nevertheless important at least to limit nosocomial spread.",

A drawback of the method is that it requires prior knowledge of the viral sequence and specific assays need to be designed for individual viruses. Using broadly reactive PCR detection systems for the genus Enterovirus, which comprises HEV and HRV, accurate discrimination of HEV and HRV species can be challenging as these viruses share a high homology and identical genome organization (Tapparel et al., 2009a). A further significant limitation of sequence-specific molecular methods is the detection of newly arising virus strains, as their sequences may deviate from known members and may not be detected accurately by the applied molecular probes.",

Therefore, to determine the actual status of infection, we performed whole nucleic acid high-throughput sequencing of throat swabs and a stool sample from several time points, which revealed an HEV infection and clearly ruled out HRV.",

In particular, 5 \u03bcL of extraction eluate was used as a template in a total volume of 20 \u03bcL, together with 4 \u03bcmol/L of random primer, 1 mmol/L of deoxyribose triphosphates, 1\u00d7 first-strand buffer, 20 mmol/L dithiothreitol and 20 U/\u03bcL of SuperScript III (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Zug, Switzerland). The template and random primers were heated at 65 \u00b0C for 5 min, before added to the rest of the reaction components. Reverse transcription was performed at 42 \u00b0C for 60 min followed by inactivation at 96 \u00b0 C for 5 min. Before second-strand synthesis, cDNA was denatured at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min and cooled down to 10 \u00b0 C for 5 min. The second strand for both RNA and DNA templates was synthesized with 0.39 U/\u03bcL T7 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) while ramping up to 37 \u00b0C at 3.37 \u00b0C/min for 8 min followed by a denaturation step at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min and cooling at 10 \u00b0C for 5 min. Additional T7 polymerase was added (0.39 U/\u03bcL), and the synthesizing step was repeated. Subsequently, DNA was amplified with primers to the anchor sequences only using AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems/Life Technologies), as previously described (Wang et al., 2003). Briefly, the PCR was performed in a total volume of 50 \u03bcL with the anchor-specific primer (1 \u03bcmol/L), dNTPs (0.25 mmol/L each), AmpliTaq Gold buffer, AmpliTaq Gold enzyme (0.05 U/\u03bcL), and the 3 \u03bcL of cDNA/DNA input from the previous step. The temperature protocol involved initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 15 min, 40 cycles of 94 \u00b0C 30 s, 40 \u00b0C 30 s, 50 \u00b0C 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C 1 min and final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. The quality and size of the generated library were checked by capillary-based gel electrophoresis (Fragment Analyzer; Advanced Analytical, Ames, IA, USA). DNA was quantified with PicoGreen (Invitrogen/Life Technologies) and diluted to 0.2 ng/\u03bcL as required for the NexteraXT protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Individual samples were dual indexed during the library preparation and pooled for sequencing. Libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq (Illumina) for 1 \u00d7 150 cycles with version 3 reagents and the \u201cFASTQ only\u201d workflow. Samples were demultiplexed using MiSeq Reporter version 2.4.60.

Reads passing quality filters are cleaned from nonviral reads by aligning with STAR (Dobin et al., 2013) against the following genomes in this order: human, bacterial, bovine, canine. The latter 2 genomes are included to eliminate contaminating reads originating from fetal calf serum and from Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells. Reads not matching any of the above genomes are blasted (Camacho et al., 2009) against a viral database that contains approximately 35,000 different complete viral genomes. This database was created from sequences downloaded from GenBank nuccore that 1) have the expression \u201ccomplete genome\u201d in the title, 2) are of viral origin (organism taxonomy id is child of id 10239, denoting all viruses), and 3) are not of cellular origin (excluding all organisms children of id 131567, denoting cellular organism) in order to avoid chimeric sequences. For each sequencing read that passed the filter step, we report the blast hit with minimum e-value, provided that coverage and identity of the hit are higher than 75%. Reads matching neither genome nor any viral sequences were reported as of unknown origin.",

The lower amount of viral reads identified during the later time points of the study might be a consequence of the onset of virus clearing as HEV levels recorded by PCR dropped from week 19 onwards (Fig. 1). As the patient suffered mainly from respiratory symptoms, a spread of HEV in the gut was not suspected. Consistently, only a comparatively low number of HEV reads were recorded in the stool sample. Importantly, for most of the samples analyzed, the number of viral reads was sufficient to reconstruct a full-length genome. Phylogenetic analysis of capsid protein VP1 showed that the isolates from different time points in this patient segregated into a distinct cluster with the closest identity to HEV-C104 AK11 (Fig. 2).",

Other viruses reported by our metagenomic approach and of potential clinical relevance were KIPyV and TTV. KIPyV is frequently identified in patients with respiratory symptoms, especially in immunocompromised individuals (Mourez et al., 2009). However, a clear link between detection of KIPyV and respiratory symptoms is yet to be established (Bialasiewicz et al., 2007, Hormozdi et al., 2010). TTV viremia has been suggested to correlate with the intensity of immunosuppression, as several recent studies reported a higher level of Anelloviridae (with a predominance of TTV) in transplant recipients with more intense immunosuppression (Burra et al., 2008, De Vlaminck et al., 2013, Focosi et al., 2014, G\u00f6rzer et al., 2014). Our analysis also reported the presence of some plant viruses such as pepino mosaic virus, which may be due to food uptake, and bacteriophage sequences, which are expected to occur in abundance due to the presence of commensal bacterial species (Table 1).",

Due to cross-reactivity issues of this assay, however, if both HEV and HRV are positive, samples are recorded Enterovirus positive. Most detection systems described for enteroviruses target the 5\u2032 noncoding part of the genome. High sequence homology in this region between HRV and HEV is responsible for the observed cross-reactivity within multiplex assays (Brown et al., 2009, van Doornum et al., 2007). In addition, for HEV-C104, it was previously reported that its genome could neither be amplified with standard Enterovirus-specific PCR nor with VP1-specific primers that are routinely used to type enteroviruses (Tapparel et al., 2009b). Alignment of the predicted amplicon sequences of the FTD21 kit identified several nucleotide differences compared to HEV-C104 strains. Although the exact sequences of primers and probe(s) used in the FTD21 kit are not available, these mutations are the most likely explanation for the observed low efficiency of amplification of the patient's HEV-C104 strain (Fig. 3). Of course, in a routine diagnostic setting, it is not feasible even with multiplex assays to have type-specific primers and probes available for the detection of all rare virus isolate that might be clinically relevant (Whiley et al., 2008). This is where metagenomic diagnostics step in as it is more comprehensive in detecting virus isolates with sequence variation that otherwise could be insufficiently detected or even missed by specific routine tests. As our analysis highlights, it is, therefore, important to include periodically broader detection methods to screen for novel or emerging virus strains and to verify the specificity of the routine (multiplex) assays.",
