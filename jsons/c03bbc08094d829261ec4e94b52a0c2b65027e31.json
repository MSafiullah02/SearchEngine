First and foremost, the spread of cross-border infectious disease arouses a great deal of media and public interest, just as it drives research priorities of faculty and academic programmes. At the same time, Global Health has become a major area of philanthropic action. Despite the importance it has acquired over the last two decades, the complex collective term \"Global Health\" still lacks a uniform use today.",

            "text": "Objectives: The objective of this paper is to present the existing definitions of Global Health, and analyse their meaning and implications. The paper emphasises that the term \"Global Health\" goes beyond the territorial meaning of \"global\", connects local and global, and refers to an explicitly political concept. Global Health regards health as a rights-based, universal good; it takes into account social inequalities, power asymmetries, the uneven distribution of resources and governance challenges. Thus, it represents the necessary continuance of Public Health in the face of diverse and ubiquitous global challenges. A growing number of international players, however, focus on publicprivate partnerships and privatisation and tend to promote biomedical reductionism through predominantly technological solutions. Moreover, the predominant Global Health concept reflects the inherited hegemony of the Global North. It takes insufficient account of the global burden of disease, which is mainly characterised by noncommunicable conditions, and the underlying social determinants of health. Conclusions: Beyond resilience and epidemiological preparedness for preventing cross-border disease threats, Global Health must focus on the social, economic and political determinants of health. Biomedical and technocratic reductionism might be justified in times of acute health crises but entails the risk of selective access to health care. Consistent health-in-all policies are required for ensuring Health for All and sustainably reducing health inequalities within and among countries. Global Health must first and foremost pursue the enforcement of the universal right to health and contribute to overcoming global hegemony.",

The increasing political importance of Global Health and the consideration of this topic on the international stage is long overdue from the point of view of health sciences and health policy. The currently prevailing understanding of Global Health, however, exhibits some conceptual limitations as the scope and content of the respective debate is often inappropriate in capturing the full complexity of the challenges. The current Global Health discourse often fails to fulfil the claim to universalism implicitly associated with the term \"global\". Moreover, it tends to neglect the requirements of a comprehensive transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary understanding of health policy. In fact, there is a large discrepancy between the current state of knowledge and Global Health policy practice [1] .",

However, public awareness of how global health has become in the meantime is regularly raised when a threat in the form of a potentially dangerous infectious disease appears [2] . When deadly infections hit the headlines, cross-border, international and increasingly global health problems attract the attention of people in the Global North. However, the succession of life-threatening scenarios caused by \"killer viruses\" and other epidemics that have long been considered defeated or at least controllable in high-income countries has become denser in recent years. What began with the spread of the AIDS pandemic has further developed in increasingly close timely order with the emergence of dangerous infectious diseases such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in Southeast Asia in 2002 and swine flu in Northern hemisphere winter time 2009-2010, MERS (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome) in 2012, and avian influenza from 2013 onwards. Particular attention was paid to the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Western Africa, which claimed more than 11,000 lives, and 5 years later in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the Zika virus in Brazil, and most recently the coronavirus pandemic that originated in the Chinese province of Wuhan and spread around the world.",

Security is frequently encountered as contextual framework in political health and foreign-policy documents, and the securitisation of health is meanwhile considered a key feature of public health governance [6] . The rapid succession of endemic and epidemic outbreaks perceived as health crises has ultimately contributed to pave the way of health into international relations [7] and shape the securitisation of Global Health promoted by multiple agents at national and international levels who interact to target cross-border threats to health [8] . In fact, acute epidemic outbreaks are often seen to be a symptom of globalisation, while Global Health tends to ignore and conceal long-term diseases like tuberculosis and the structural causes of bad health and health inequalities [9] . The increasing international and political relevance of Global Health calls for more comprehensive governance strategies of institutions and processes, which have an explicit health mandate (Global Health governance), for institutions and processes of global governance which have a direct and indirect impact on health (global governance for health), and for national and regional institutions and mechanisms which are established for contributing to governing Global Health governance (governance for Global Health) [10] .",

In contrast to the so-called disease sciences with their focus on individual health problems, Public Health and Health Sciences are explicitly population centred.

This requires interdisciplinary cooperation between politics, science and society as well as an analytical understanding of the complex interrelationships and transdisciplinary action. The concept of Global Health pursues a comprehensive, holistic, multi-or transdisciplinary and human rights-based approach. As a synthesis of Public Health, which lacks an international orientation, and International Health, which pursues a transnational approach but focuses more specifically on actual health sector policy, tropical medicine and development cooperation, the Global Health concept intrinsically includes health problems beyond the influence of individual states and pursues an explicitly political approach. Particular attention is paid to governance issues and challenges, i. e. the politically responsible guidance and rulemaking of governments or other relevant decision-makers in order to ensure the effective performance of the various actors in the health sector and other relevant fields in the public's interest.",

This understanding is recognisably shaped by the legacy of colonialism and Western-dominated expertise on the \"tropical\" world and its challenges [54] . Thus, the prevalent concentration of Global Health policy on both cross-border health problems and the spread of dangerous infectious diseases often lacks an in-depth understanding of political, social and economic conditions and requirements. Policies and health strategies are often lacking the intrinsic complexity and universality of Global Health, most recently in the context of the coronavirus pandemic (see below).",

            "text": "However, the claim for integrating approaches to communicable and non-communicable diseases by combining the implementation and improvement of surveillance with targeted health-in-all policy interventions, which are promising to be successful and cost-effective at the time, [34, 60] has not yet received a significant practical response. The latter include a broad array of measures such as restrictions on tobacco access and sales e. g. by sales bans for adolescents or raising tobacco taxes, limiting the use of alcohol and other harmful drugs, enacting speed limits, making the use of motorcycle helmets and seat belts legally binding, introducing legal requirements to reduce air and other environment pollution, and enforcing measures to reduce potentially hazardous components such as salt, sugar and trans fats in commercial food products, among others. The impact of these interventions, which are typically implemented at national levels, on communicable diseases is rather indirect and modest, and opportunities for integrating approaches are still to be found. This is partly due to the fact that the integration of these types of interventions into Global Health practice is often taken for granted or, at best, not problematised as a legitimate political challenge [61] . Even more, approaches to implementing health-in-all policies are repeatedly surpassed by biomedical and technocratic approaches that tend to occupy the forefront of public interests and political decision-making. There are barely any Global Health documents that do not mention the social determinants of health; however, the adequate consideration and implementation is lagging behind the aspirations. One reason is that the healthcare sector is organised around special professional interests rather than prepared to deal with the contemporary public and Global Health challenges, which are all cross-cutting in nature and require intersectoral approaches [62] . The most prominent multilateral organisations at the forefront of tackling Global Health, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), follow a vertical approach, put special emphasis on selected health challenges and use to apply instruments which are specific to a certain disease (e. g. HIV/AIDS in the case of the GFATM, or vaccine provision in the case of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunzations -GAVI) or target group (e. g. children in the case of UNICEF). They have hardly contributed to health-systems strengthening [63] or funding [64] ; nor have they pursued broader health-in-all strategies beyond improving health services and healthcare delivery. This imbalance is particularly reflected in Global Health initiatives such as GAVI dedicated to saving children's lives and protecting people's health by improving access to immunisation in poor countries. The general public around the globe is usually much less aware of the economic, social, political and other determinants of health than of the impact of worldwide epidemics on economic, social, political and other conditions of human life [65] .",

At the peak of the outbreak, the public and political debate is widely dominated by biomedical and biotechnical topics and restricted to the expertise of virologists and immunologists who form a kind of opinion monopoly that is able to determine political decision making as well as the reporting of the epidemic all over the world.

In spite of this and the crucial importance of non-medical factors, there is no comparable research fund yet in sight for investigating the social, political, economic and ecological determinants of the development and the overcoming of the pandemic.

This vision is lacking in many medical and health-science publications where technological measures prevail over strategies to eliminate and address underlying causes [68] or is incomplete in others [69] ; and it has not yet found its place in the broader debate on Global Health. The German Platform for Global Health, an association of trade unions, non-governmental organisations and scientists, repeatedly points out the significance of the social conditions of health and the need to bring non-medical determinants more into the national and international health debate [70, 71] .

The unequal balance of power in times of politically and militarily enforced colonialism was more bluntly visible and ideologically covered by racial superiority, but Global Health reproduces the unequal relations and global inequalities until today. The scientific debate and research on Global Health is dominated by North American and European universities, which play a vital role in this field and sustain Global North-South research gaps [82, 83] .",

In 2014, more than 60 governments, international organisations and non-governmental stakeholders launched the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) as a concept to address the outbreaks of infectious diseases and reduce their spread to other countries [85] . Global Health security is often used to justify restrictive immigration policies and practices that restrict population movement across international borders by framing the migration of people as a risk. Rather than enhancing the local health system capacities, public policies in the name of Global Health security tend to focus on the protection of national borders in the Global North against perceived health threats from countries in the Global South [86] . However, it has to be pointed out that the fear-based focus on the prevention of and protection from infectious diseases is a clearly hegemonic approach that is far from adequately reflecting the global burden of disease, which is largely determined by noncommunicable diseases [87] . In addition, the focus on health security often prevents or, at least, postpones the necessary debate about social, economic, and political determinants of health.",

Such cooperation primarily benefits rich partners from high-income countries, as there is usually no appropriate political and social embedding of the results and successes in the systems of developing and emerging countries [88] . Often the funds provided by the richer partners flow past the national health systems or the projects even require additional funds that are then no longer available for the care of patients in rural areas or throughout the country [89] .

The fact that in recent years the global context of health has increasingly come to the fore is encouraging as long as Global Health is not reduced to epidemiological preparedness for preventing the cross-border spread of infectious diseases particularly to high-income countries. Biomedical and technocratic reductionism leads to selective access to health care, and privatisation increases rather than reduces health inequalities. Global Health has to emphasise the social, economic and political determinants of health. Health-in-all policies are required for ensuring Health for All and sustainably reducing health inequalities within and among countries. Global Health requires an understanding of human rights that does not regard health as a profitable \"business model\", but as the aspiration of every human being. It must first and foremost pursue the enforcement of the universal right to health and contribute to overcoming global hegemony. Global Health must also address the causes of the impoverishment of the Global South, namely colonialism, the economic order oriented towards short-term profit maximisation and the ecological exploitation of natural resources in particular. Responsible Global Health policy has to address the causes of existing problems and must not limit itself to restoring the conditions that led to the global and planetary health crisis. ",
