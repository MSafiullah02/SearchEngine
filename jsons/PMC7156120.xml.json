No language restrictions were applied. Our search returned 134 publications. These papers described demographic, clinical, and biological characteristics of patients with COVID-19, and radiological or pathological findings associated with, COVID-19. In particular, they reported most common symptoms, incubation periods, biological abnormalities, radiographic abnormalities, CT abnormalities, and treatment data. They also described varying degrees of illness and their severity: mild, severe, or critical. They reported proportion of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, or case fatality rates and variables associated with these complications and death. In addition, these studies reported data on virus shedding. They studied in particular dynamics of the viral load in sputum, urine, throat swab, and stool samples in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. They also evaluated virus shedding in patients who had recovered.\nAdded value of this study\nThis study reports clinical data from the first patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Europe. The study also brings to the field some new and original findings by including patients at different stages of infection (ie, at very early stages or later in the course of the disease) and through a detailed and comprehensive sampling strategy; patients enrolled early being contacts of patients enrolled later during the course of the disease. To our knowledge, the association between clinical evolution and the virological dynamic has not been reported in the past. It allowed us to describe three patterns: paucisymptomatic patients diagnosed very quickly over their disease course, with an early high nasopharyngeal shedding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5\u00b72 and 7\u00b74 log10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively); patients with a two-step disease progression, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and a patient with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma (ie, an old patient).\nImplications of all the available evidence\nPaucisymptomatic patients, because of high viral loads in upper respiratory tract samples, might potentially transmit the disease during the very first days of symptoms despite having a mild presentation of the disease. The implication is that COVID-19 control measures should combine immediate isolation of cases after symptom onset together with a rapid screening and monitoring of the contacts of infected patients. In patients with severe disease, two patterns were identified. The first pattern was a biphasic evolution starting with a mild presentation followed by a secondary respiratory worsening despite a decreasing viral load in the nasopharyngeal samples, suggesting that the lung damage at this phase is more related to immunopathological lesions. The second pattern, observed in the most severely ill patient who died, was a persistent and high viral excretion in the upper respiratory tract samples combined with a positive virus detection in other body fluids including blood. These findings will contribute to better understanding of the natural history of the disease and in tailoring treatment strategies.\n",

On the basis of expert opinion and available data in January, 2020, we considered that remdesivir might be the best potential drug for the treatment of COVID-19, although restricted to patients with severe disease (intravenous route, a loading dose of 200 mg, then maintenance daily dose of 100 mg for a total duration of 10 days). Criteria for discharge with total recovery were from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control guidelines: asymptomatic patients with two RT-PCR negative nasopharyngeal samples at least 48 h apart.11\n",

Upper and lower (when possible) respiratory tract samples, and also blood, urine, and stool samples (or rectal swabs, if appropriate) were obtained. Upper respiratory samples were either nasopharyngeal aspirates or nasopharyngeal swabs (Sigma Virocult, Medical Wire Instrument, Corsham, UK), stool samples were either faecal swabs or stools, and blood samples were EDTA tube adapted for RT-PCR. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to the laboratories of the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where procedures for RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR (rtRT-PCR), and virus isolation and titration were undertaken. RNA extraction was done with the Extraction NucleoSpin Dx Virus kit (Macherey Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) or by the automated NucliSENS easyMAG (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy-l'\u00c9toile, France), using the manufacturers' instructions. RdRp-IP1 and RdRp quantitative rtRT-PCR (appendix p 4) was used for detection of SARS-CoV-2. The RdRp RT-PCR corresponds to the Charit\u00e9 protocol.14 When a sample (respiratory samples, plasma, or stool) was positive with RdRp-IP1, quantification of the number of RNA copies was done according to a scale ranging from 103 to 106 copies per \u03bcL. The viral load in stools was calculated as previously described15 and expressed in number of RNA copies per g of stool. The quality of nasopharyngeal swabs was checked using the CELL Control r-gene kit (bioM\u00e9rieux). This kit is provided with quantified plasmid for cellular quantification. All viral loads for respiratory samples were calculated with the same method as for stools15 and normalised according to the cellular quantification as the number of RNA copies per 1000 cells. All positive plasma samples were quantified and expressed as number of RNA copies per mL. Primer and probe sequences (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium; appendix p 4) either correspond to the RdRp or E gene assay from the Charit\u00e9 protocol14 or to the RdRp-IP1 assay designed at The Institut Pasteur to target a section of the RdRp gene based on the first sequences of SARS-CoV-2 made available on the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database on Jan 11, 2020 (appendix p 5). For further details on RNA extraction, high-throughput virus sequencing, and virus titration and isolation see the appendix (pp 2\u20133).",

He did not report any specific exposure within the 14 days before symptom onset. He had a thyroid cancer removed in 2010. He had fever and diarrhoea from Jan 22, and went to the emergency room in another hospital on Jan 25, where the chest x-ray showed bilateral alveolar opacities. He did not fulfil the COVID-19 case definition. However, airborne and contact precautions were observed during his hospital stay before COVID-19 diagnosis. On Jan 26, an acute respiratory failure triggered his ICU admission to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital. He subsequently developed multiple organ failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, liver failure, and sepsis-like shock. After the COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed on Jan 28, he was transferred to the referent ICU at Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital in Paris, where broad-spectrum antibacterials were started for a possible superinfection. Remdesivir was started with a loading dose. As two pathogens were identified, a susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii (multiplex PCR, confirmed by tracheal aspirates culture) and an Aspergillus flavus (tracheal aspirates culture), the anti-infective treatment was adapted. We treated A baumanii with meropenem, tigecycline, and colimycin followed by meropenem and levofloxacin. We initially treated A flavus with voriconazole but switched to isavuconazole because voriconazole and remdesivir both contain sulphobutylether-\u03b2-cyclodextrin, and the safety of this association has not been evaluated yet. Remdesivir was discontinued on Jan 30 because the patient needed renal replacement therapy. CT scan on Jan 31 showed a bilateral pleuropneumopathy including pleural effusion, alveolar condensations, ground-glass opacities, and pulmonary cysts. On Feb 5, because of the severity of the disease and persistence of viral detection, and as the risk\u2013benefit assessment was considered favourable, remdesivir was reinitiated. Multiple organ failure persisted despite appropriate treatment against A baumannii and A flavus and no other superinfection was identified. The patient died on Feb 14 (illness day 24).",

High viral loads in upper respiratory tract samples are suggestive of potentially high risk of transmissibility during the very first days of symptoms. This finding is in line with data reported by Zou and colleagues, who analysed viral load in the upper respiratory tract in relation to day of onset of symptoms in 17 symptomatic patients in whom higher viral loads were detected soon after symptom onset.16 This observation suggests that the virus shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is different from that seen with SARS-CoV, in which the virus load was very low at disease onset.17, 18, 19 These findings might affect the implementation of infection control measures. The implication is that COVID-19 control measures should combine immediate isolation of patients with the disease together with a rapid screening and monitoring of the contacts of these patients to detect those with very mild symptoms. In two of five patients reported here, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool samples. This possible route of transmission must be investigated; detection of viral RNA does not necessarily imply that infectious particles are present and transmissible,20 particularly when patients, such as these two individuals, have no diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal symptoms.",

In patients with this pattern, a CT scan at the moment of the worsening showed ground-glass lung opacities, in line with those reported by others in patients with COVID-19.8, 20 Time to worsening of respiratory symptoms was around 10 days after disease onset in these two cases, close to the median disease duration before worsening (8\u00b70 days [IQR 5\u00b70\u201313\u00b70]), previously reported by Huang and collaborators.6 In these patients, one might postulate that the lung damage is more related to immunopathological lesions, resulting from an excessive pro-inflammatory host response, rather than to uncontrolled viral replication.6 Of note, we did not assess virus load in low respiratory tract samples from these two patients.",

By contrast with the previous pattern, this persistent high viral load suggests the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 to evade the immune response. Indeed, we can speculate that, as shown during Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS coronavirus infections,21, 22 SARS-CoV-2 might be able to inhibit the interferon signalling pathways, resulting in higher respiratory virus load, positive viraemia, and eventually poor prognosis, as for MERS-CoV.23, 24 Indeed, the 80-year-old patient, unlike the other cases, had evidence of high viral replication in the respiratory tract and evidence for systemic virus dissemination beyond the respiratory tract, with virus detection in plasma and pleural effusion fluid. The impaired immune response might have facilitated the bacterial and fungal superinfections. Patients with similar, severe patterns (sustained viral RNA in the respiratory tract and detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the blood) have also been reported in China.6 As reported in previous studies,12, 25 severely ill patients are often older patient with comorbidities.

Among potential candidates, remdesivir is an antiviral prodrug (nucleosidic analogue family) that has broad-spectrum in-vitro and in-vivo activity against numerous RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. In animal models, compared with lopinavir plus ritonavir combined with interferon beta, two other potential candidates, remdesivir more significantly reduced the virus titre of mice infected with the MERS-CoV and decreased the lung tissue damage.26 Remdesivir treatment improved disease outcomes and reduced viral loads in SARS-CoV-infected mice27 and is inhibitory for SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.28 A phase 3 clinical trial assessed this drug for the treatment of Ebola virus infection; therefore, data exist for the safety of use in humans.29 Hence, on the basis of expert opinion, we considered remdesivir use in the three patients with severe disease patterns. To the best of our knowledge, only one case of remdesivir use in COVID-19 has been reported so far.20 Two randomised controlled trials are enrolling patients in China to assess the clinical benefit of this treatment (NCT04257656; NCT04252664). On the basis of our data, we cannot draw any conclusions on the potential efficacy of remdesivir on COVID-19 infections. In two patients, the drug was initiated at the time of disease worsening, when the virus was already barely detectable in the clinical specimens. In one of them, remdesivir was discontinued after 5 days because of a combined alanine aminotransferase elevation and a rash, although it could not be confirmed that this adverse event was related to remdesivir. In the third patient, remdesivir was discontinued after a single dose because of renal replacement therapy to avoid risk of cyclodextrin accumulation. Remdesivir contains cyclodextrin, an excipient whose clearance is linearly related to creatinine clearance. Because the patient's condition was worsening and viral load was not decreasing, we reinitiated remdesivir.",
