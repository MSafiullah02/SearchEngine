A panel of common respiratory viruses was investigated using two independent multiplex RT-PCR assays with primers specific for each virus and viral type. RV species and genotypes were identified by seminested PCR assays, sequencing and phylogenetic tree analyses. results At least one respiratory virus was identified in 206 (74.4%) children hospitalised with clinical pneumonia. RV was the most common virus identified in both HIV-infected (17 of 38, 44.7%) and HIV-uninfected (74 of 237, 31.2%; P = 0.100) children. RV-A was the most common RV species identified (47 of 275, 17.0%), followed by RV-C (35/275, 12.6%) and RV-B (8/275, 2.9%).

Management and prevention efforts against pneumonia in developing countries have traditionally focused on bacterial pathogens. The introduction of effective conjugate vaccines globally has led to decreasing trends in bacterial pneumonia and a subsequent increased interest in the role of virus-associated ALRI. Recent advances in molecular diagnostics such as PCR have also led to the discovery of new viruses and viral species, highlighting the prominence of viruses in respiratory disease. Respiratory viruses are widely acknowledged to be the most common cause of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections in the developed world [2] . However, advanced diagnostics are largely limited in the developing world, and studies including a comprehensive range of viral pathogens are scarce in many African countries. The majority of respiratory viral aetiological studies in Africa have relied on traditional cell culture and serological methods with PCR data only becoming available in recent years. Data beyond respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are still scarce, and aetiological studies of ALRI in African children published as recently as 2013 did not screen for common respiratory viruses such as RV, coronavirus and bocavirus [3] , or were unable to distinguish RV from enterovirus [4] .",

The identification of RV-C as the third RV species, first reported in 2006, led to several investigations on the prevalence of RV species, conducted predominantly in developed countries. The majority of these studies on children hospitalised with ALRI or asthma found that RV-C was the most prevalent RV species and was often associated with more severe illness [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . While there have been previous reports on the overall prevalence of RV in children with acute respiratory infections or pneumonia in Mozambique, none have specifically investigated RV species [14, 15] . In the two Mozambican studies of respiratory viral prevalence, RV was the most commonly identified virus, identified in 26% of children with acute respiratory infections and in 24% with pneumonia. Only three other studies have investigated the prevalence of RV species in African children [16] [17] [18] . While these studies confirmed the importance of RV in African children, they were inconclusive with respect to the role of RV species in ALRI in African children.",

Identification of common respiratory viruses (adenovirus, RSV, bocavirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza viruses, influenza viruses and metapneumovirus) was carried out using two independent multiplex RT-PCR assays with primers specific for each virus and viral type. RV identification and genotyping were based on a published molecular method to determine RV genotypes and to differentiate closely related enteroviruses from RV [33] . Viral RNA was first extracted from a 240 ll volume of NPAs using the QIA-GEN QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Spin protocol) and reverse-transcribed to cDNA. This was used for the PCR amplification of a 260-bp variable sequence in the 5 0 non-coding region of the RV genome using in-house designed primers. PCR products were then sequenced commercially by the Australian Genome Research Facility. Genotypes were assigned based on comparisons of the 5 0 non-coding region sequences with those of 101 classical serotypes as well as 52 newly identified genotypes using ClustalX software (Conway Institute, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland). Representative samples of each genotype have previously been sequenced at the VP4-VP2 coding region to confirm the species assignment [34, 35] .",

            "text": "Consistent with previous reports from Mozambique, RV was the most common respiratory virus identified in Mozambican children from Manhic \u00dfa with clinical pneumonia [14, 15] . RV-A was the most commonly identified RV species followed by RV-C and RV-B. Only three studies have investigated RV species in children with respiratory illness in Africa. Consistent with our findings, two studies of children with ALRI from Kenya and Burundi reported that RV-A was the most common species identified, followed by RV-C and RV-B [17, 18] . In contrast, a study from South Africa investigated acute wheezing illness in young children [16] and reported RV-C as the most common RV species. Other studies of children hospitalised with asthma or wheezing, predominantly from developed countries, have also found RV-C to be the most frequently identified species [10] [11] [12] 37] . Several RV genotypes from each species were identified suggesting that a large number of genotypes are circulating in the community and that no single RV genotype predominates at any given time. Hence, our findings support the majority of African studies that report RV-A to be more common than RV-C in children with ALRI. A respiratory virus was identified in almost three-quarters of children hospitalised with clinical pneumonia, which is higher than previous results from Mozambique [14, 15] but comparable with results from other similar settings [38, 39] . We also identified higher prevalence of viral co-infections (24.2%) than the previous reports from Mozambique which may be due to screening with a larger panel of respiratory viruses as well as more sensitive molecular techniques [14, 15] . However, comparable rates have been reported in paediatric populations outside Mozambique [40] . Given the high rate of viral identifications in children hospitalised with ALRI, our findings support current literature on the importance of respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of ALRI. However, like the majority of viral aetiology investigations, our study was limited by the use of NPAs to identify respiratory viruses, which may not be entirely representative of respiratory viruses in the lower airway. Further investigations using lower airway samples as well as the inclusion of a contemporaneous control group may facilitate better understanding of the role of viruses in clinical pneumonia.",

            "text": "This is the first study to describe the prevalence of RV species among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children in Mozambique with WHO-defined clinical pneumonia. Thirty-eight (13.7%) cases were HIV infected, of which 26 (68.4%) had at least one respiratory virus. Contrary to our hypothesis, respiratory virus (including RV species) identification was not more common among HIV-infected than HIV-uninfected children. However, previous studies from Africa have reported increased viral identification rates among HIV-infected children [15, 41] . Madhi et al. reported that viral identification among HIV-infected children varied according to respiratory virus and was lowest for RSV [41] . There are limited viral data on HIV-infected children with ALRI, and, like ours, most of these studies were limited to relatively small sample sizes and were unable to draw conclusions about the role of HIV. Further investigations including a larger HIV-positive cohort are needed. Overall, we did not find RV-A or RV-C to be associated with any particular clinical feature. Other studies have reported that overall, RV identification in children with ALRI was associated with unique clinical characteristics such as wheeze [42] and atopic dermatitis [43] . We also did not observe any differences in associated clinical features between the three RV species. However, this could be due to the small numbers within each RV species, particularly in the RV-B group, or to our study population representing a moderate-to-severe subset of all respiratory infections. In concordance with our findings, Luchsinger et al. [44] did not observe any differences between RV species according to clinical features or severity of illness in infants in Chile with ALRI. We Similarly, other studies have also reported that RSV was associated with more severe disease than RV [44, 45] . However, these studies investigated children with bronchiolitis rather than pneumonia and may also be confounded by age. Two-thirds of children were recruited during the warm and wet months. This is consistent with previous studies from Mozambique that reported an increase in the number of outpatient visits associated with malaria [46] and lower respiratory infection [47] during the rainy months of the year. Furthermore, O'Callaghan et al. [14] showed that viral respiratory infections contributed to the high burden of hospital visits during these months RV was prevalent throughout the year, with no significant differences between the seasons. Although we observed slightly lower RV prevalence during the cool and dry season, particularly from June to August, this was not significant and possibly due to population size. Our findings are supported by previous investigations of RV species in Africa, which found no seasonality patterns for RV or RV species identification [3, 17] . In contrast to RV, RSV did show clear seasonal patterns and was most prevalent during the warm and wet season. This finding has been supported by previous studies from Mozambique [48] and Ghana [3] that reported RSV epidemics during the rainy season. In contrast, other studies from Burkina Faso, [49] Senegal [50] and South Africa [48] found RSV infections peaked in the dry season.",

This study also has a few limitations. Firstly, we identified respiratory viruses in NPAs. Although nasopharyngeal identification of viruses has been associated with lower respiratory tract infections, it also occurs among healthy, asymptomatic individuals. Because the mechanisms that lead to lower respiratory infection remain poorly understood, viral identification in the upper airway may not be entirely representative of that of the lower airway. Furthermore, as we are unable to differentiate asymptomatic infection from clinical (symptomatic) infection using molecular methods of detection, a virus-positive NPA suggests but does not prove causation.",

Hence, our findings are not necessarily representative of the overall ALRI population and do not include children with isolated symptoms such as wheeze. Thirdly, our study did not include a contemporaneous control group to compare the prevalence of respiratory viruses between sick and healthy children. A useful control group may include children from the community without respiratory illness as well as children with an upper respiratory illness not severe enough to present to hospital. Nonetheless, this study provides important data on the prevalence of RV species in children with WHO-defined clinical pneumonia in Mozambique. ",
