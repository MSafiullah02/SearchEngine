By protein chip array profiling technology, a number of serum biomarkers that might be useful in monitoring the clinical course of SARS patients were identified. This book chapter describes how the protein chip array profiling was carried out for this study. Briefly, SARS patients'serum samples were first fractionated in Q Ceramic HyperD ion exchange sorbent beads by buffers at different pH. Serum protein fractions thus obtained were then bound onto a copper (II) immobilized metal affinity capture (IMAC30 Cu [II]) ProteinChip \u00ae Array or a weak cation-exchange (CM10) ProteinChip Array. After washing and addition of sinapinic acid, the chips were read in a Protein Biological System (PBS) IIc mass spectrometer. Ions were generated by laser shots and flied in a time of flight mode to the ion detector according to their mass over charge (m/z) ratio. The serum profiling spectra in SARS patients were acquired, baseline subtracted and analyzed in parallel with those from the control subjects by Ciphergen ProteinChip Software 3.0.2 with their peak intensities compared by a nonparametric two sample Mann-Whitney-U test. More than twelve peaks were differentially expressed in SARS patients with one at m/z of 11,695 (later identified to be serum amyloid A protein), which had increase in peak intensity correlating with the extent of SARS-coronavirus induced pneumonia as defined by a serial chest X-ray opacity score. The remaining biomarkers could also be useful in the study of other clinical parameters in SARS patients.

As compared to other upper viral respiratory infections (2), SARS-CoV can rapidly induce pneumonia. The accompanying adult respiratory distress syndrome can quickly progress resulting in rapid death of the patients (3,4) . The most commonly used laboratory diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-infection are reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and anti-SARS-CoV antibody serological tests (5-7), but their roles in monitoring the extent of pneumonia are rather limited. Although, serial chest radiography is helpful for monitoring the progress of disease (8, 9) , it is also limited by its subjectivity and variability in the interpretation of the imaging results and occasionally suboptimal quality of portable films taken in isolation ward to avoid the spread of the disease. In a recent article, the discovery of 12 upor downregulated serum biomarkers were reported in SARS patients by a novel protein chip array profiling approach (10- 14) with one biomarker appears to be useful in monitoring the extent of pneumonia (15) . In this chapter, how this protein chip array profiling technique is carried out is described. The technique involves four steps with the first step being serum fractionation in ceramic ion exchange sorbent beads. This step separates serum proteins into several fractions aiming at reducing their complexity before protein chip profiling is performed. The second step involves the binding of serum protein biomarkers onto protein chip array surfaces. The third step is desorption of bound serum biomarkers by laser shots in the mass spectrometer generating a time of flight spectrum for each sample. The fourth step concerns with data acquisition, data processing and statistical analyses of the spectra in SARS patients in comparison with the control groups.
