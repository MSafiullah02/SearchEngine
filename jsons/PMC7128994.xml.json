While two thirds of the 194 World Health Assembly countries have failed to comply with the regulations as of 2015, and for the one third who say they did, there are serious concerns about the reliability of their self-assessment.4 Now, with Liberia declared free of Ebola and declining incidence in Sierra Leone and Guinea, these same regulations are once again being revisited after more than a decade.4 Is this a futile exercise and should the IHRs be abandoned if they cannot be enforced by WHO and fulfilled by the World Health Assembly (WHA) member nations? The national health systems in West Africa, and for most low and middle income countries (LMICs), would not meet IHR standards (despite claims by some member WHA nations) and it is unlikely that following the Ebola pandemic much will change.",

There were no drugs or vaccines available to treat and prevent the disease, thus quarantine, isolation and safe burials were the primary methods utilized to halt the spread of disease and were initiated by the afflicted nations themselves.5 It typically takes years if not decades to develop a vaccine or drug that will have public health impact. One only has to look at the countless billions that have been spent on trying to develop a vaccine for HIV, thus far without success. Moreover, weak, malnourished, immunosuppressed populations living in poverty with little or no hygiene, sanitation or running water will always be highly susceptible to new emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases.6 At \u2018ground zero\u2019 of the Ebola epidemic it was believed that in 2013, hungry children living in the remote Guinean village of Meliandou killed and ate infected fruit bats.7, 8 Thus, what can realistically be done to prevent and contain future national epidemics from becoming global pandemics? We discuss a number of issues that urgently need to be addressed in order to plan, and possibly prevent, the next global pandemic.",

For example, in metro Manila, the most densely populated city in the world, approximately six million people live in slums with no piped water or toilets. According to WHO, 137 million people in urban centres have no access to safe drinking water and over 600 million lack sanitation.10 The UN predicts that the world's urban population will double to over six billion by 2050 and most of the increase in density will occur in LMICs.10 Population density is directly correlated with the rate of transmission of respiratory and faecal-oral pathogens (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, influenza, cholera, rotavirus, helminths).10\n",

The current outbreak of MERS-CoV in South Korea is of grave concern given the case fatality rate is over 10%. Surveillance of zoonotic diseases is largely based on detecting illnesses in humans who often serve as the sentinel species and dead-end hosts.13 Apart from rabies, most national surveillance systems in the world do not monitor zoonotic diseases appearing in wildlife, yet 72% of zoonotic EIDs (e.g. Anthrax, Nipah virus, Hantavirus, type A influenza, SARS, MERS-CoV, Ebola) come from this source.9, 13 Many RNA viruses have emerged and dispersed globally such as Chikungunya virus, West Nile virus and dengue virus. These three arboviruses alone have morbidity and mortality rates that far exceed those of the combined rates of SARS, Ebola and MERS-CoV.14, 15 Thus, EID discovery efforts need to be directed toward reservoirs and vectors at the human-animal interface.16 The integration of human, veterinary, and agricultural medicine, as proposed by the \u2018One Health\u2019 approach, should result in earlier warning of EIDs and provide us with a better opportunity to respond to potential spill-over threats.13, 17 Moreover, targeting surveillance to regional hotspots of EIDs provides an evidence-based rationale for more appropriate allocation of global resources.16\n",

Clearly these ethical issues, which are well known by the WHA member representatives, will impact on future IHR compliance. Furthermore, member nations from LMICs do not have the national capacity to adhere to IHR, given they have very weak infrastructure and poorly financed health systems.3 LMICs must be given considerable financial and capacity building assistance or they will be unable to comply.

However improvements and access to diagnostic technologies will need to be supported by the capacity to interpret and act on the findings. Presently limited health-care dollars are spent on running tertiary national hospitals with little, or none, spent on preventive services, disease control or epidemic preparedness. However, most countries do have offices or departments for communicable disease control with the number of staff engaged in such full-time activities varying considerably. At the district/municipal level most developing countries have medical health officers and at the community level a considerable human resource of community health workers (CHWs).",

In September 2014, the UN assumed leadership of the Ebola response and created the UN Mission for Emergency Ebola Response (UNMEER), the first UN mission to respond to public health emergencies.3 In contrast with IHR recommendations, Security Council resolutions are legally binding for member countries.3 We now propose a new UN Centre for Disease Control (UN CDC), potentially based in New York, to serve at the apex of a new global health framework with a number of new and existing regional CDCs reporting directly to it (Figure 3\n). A proposed structure might be: National CDC departments reporting to their regional CDCs, and Provincial/District/Municipal CDC departments reporting to their National CDCs with Community Health Workers at local health centres reporting to their municipal health officers. In sum, at the apex of our proposed global health framework would sit a new UN CDC with Security Council authority and at the foundation, CHWs in local health centres. CHWs have transformed the health-care systems of many developing nations including Bangladesh, India, Ethiopia, and Malawi and are absolutely crucial for future global security.21\n",

PEF is a global financing facility that would channel funds swiftly to governments, multilateral agencies, NGOs and others, to finance efforts to contain dangerous epidemic outbreaks before they turn into pandemics. Financing from the PEF will be linked to strong country-level epidemic and pandemic emergency preparedness plans, thereby incentivizing recipient governments and the international community to introduce greater rigor and discipline into crisis preparedness and reduce the potential for moral hazard. The PEF is expected to cover a range of response activities such as: (i) rapid deployment of a trained and ready health care work force; (ii) medical equipment, pharmaceuticals and diagnostic supplies; (iii) logistics and food supplies; and (iv) coordination and communication. The PEF would not cover pandemic preparedness or reconstruction efforts. A total of $1 billion is available for all of the 77 poorest countries through June 2017.\u201d22\n",

A multi-billion US dollar International Health System fund has been proposed3 but considerable funding from both the private and public sector will need to be secured if the fund is to be successfully launched. The G20, the European Union, and philanthropic organizations will need to contribute. The implementation and monitoring of such funds at the national level will have to be carefully scrutinised and audited if the core capacities of the IHRs are to be achieved and maintained. Ultimately LMIC nations themselves will need to allocate health care dollars toward health prevention and epidemic planning. For many LMICs this is not a priority and they are ill prepared to respond to epidemics on their own soils. Building national capacity is the rate limiting step for global health security.
