Typically, rotavirus affects foals between 5 and 35 days of age, with most foals at the younger end of this spectrum.29 The most common and obvious clinical sign is diarrhea, and fecal consistency can vary greatly. Other signs relate to disease severity, including depression, anorexia, dehydration, and similar findings. The virus causes blunting of the small intestinal microvilli, with malabsorption and maldigestion. Diagnosis can be confirmed with fecal electron microscopy, which has a significant lag time, or commercial immunoassays, also performed on feces. Treatment is principally supportive, with extra emphasis placed on biosecurity protocols. Quaternary ammonium compounds are ineffective as disinfectant agents for equine rotavirus. The virus is extremely contagious, with morbidity approaching 100% in farm outbreaks. Prognosis is good with supportive care, and mortality is typically low in uncomplicated cases.",

Outbreaks of Potomac horse fever (PHF) and clostridial colitis are rare, although the latter may occur as a clustering of cases of foals or hospitalized horses.

IFA utilizes serum, and PCR is performed on buffy coat or feces. Most laboratories that perform PCR use buffy coats isolated from standard ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)\u2013treated whole-blood tubes. Infected horses develop high IFA titers (>1:640) within days of infection, often before clinical signs are apparent. Paired serum samples (acute and convalescent) should be collected within 5 to 7 days rather than the conventional interval of 2 to 4 weeks because infected horses rapidly develop high titers. It is generally believed that horses with PHF should have a titer of 1:80 or greater at the onset of signs; consequently, a negative titer indicates this disease is unlikely. Vaccination for PHF results in positive titers that usually disappear by 6 to 9 months. PCR offers the advantage of excellent sensitivity without the potential for interference from vaccination.47,\n48\n",

These cultures require special media and antigens for serogroup identification and are readily available through most, if not all, commercial laboratories. Multiple cultures are preferable. Recovery of pathologic organisms can be difficult when feces are very watery, and thus the most productive cultures are performed on feces with at least some substance. Culture of a rectal mucosal biopsy sample may also improve the recovery rate.49 PCR is reported to be a more sensitive method for detection of salmonella in feces.50, 51, 52, 53 The diagnostic significance of horses positive by PCR but negative by culture of multiple fecal samples remains to be determined.

Commercial ELISA assays are available for detection of C. difficile toxins A and B, as well as the enterotoxin of Clostridium perfringens (CPE). Genotyping of C. perfringens isolates is also commercially available. Aerobic storage of fecal samples is unsuitable if samples are intended for culture of C. difficile because of the short length of time that organisms remain viable when stored under those conditions. However, toxins remain stable for at least 30 days when fecal samples are stored aerobically.54 Many diagnostic laboratories will perform toxin testing, and some will provide packages including both culture and toxin analysis.

Typically, mild to moderate acidemia is corrected by restoration of plasma volume with an alkalinizing solution such as lactated Ringer's or Normosol-R. Sodium chloride solutions (0.9%) should be avoided because they can be acidifying and may worsen edema. In horses with severe dehydration, initial therapy with hypertonic saline may be used to restore circulatory volume, but must be followed by administration of isotonic fluids. Alternatively, hydroxyethyl starch (Hetastarch) can also be used for quick expansion of plasma volume while also inducing a rapid increase in colloid oncotic pressure.",

Although many specific diseases can result in chronic diarrhea, identification of the inciting cause in a patient frequently remains elusive. Occasionally, problems of a non-GI nature, such as hepatic disease or abdominal abscessation, result in diarrhea. Infectious causes of chronic diarrhea include chronic salmonellosis (see Chapter 38) and parasitism with large or small stronglyes (see Chapter 61). Recently, the spirochete Brachyspira pilosicoli was implicated in a herd outbreak of chronic diarrhea in weanling-age horses.61 Noninfectious inflammatory causes of chronic diarrhea include granulomatous enteritis or colitis, neoplasia (predominantly lymphosarcoma), sand irritation, and right dorsal colitis (Fig. 3-5\n). Noninflammatory causes include a range of problems, with the common theme of disruption in the flora of the large intestine. This may or may not be related to a dietary disruption, and many affected horses have few other clinical signs.

Culture of peritoneal fluid should be performed in all suspected cases, but this procedure has a low sensitivity, with only 9.5% to 32.5% of samples yielding positive growth.65, 66, 67 Total cell count can be increased after enterocentesis, abdominal surgery, or open castration.72, 73, 74, 75, 76 Thus, additional parameters must be considered in these populations. Abundant hypoechoic or variably echogenic peritoneal fluid (evident on abdominal ultrasound examination), fever, depression, and abdominal pain can all support the diagnosis (Fig. 3-6\n). A decrease in peritoneal fluid pH (<7.3) or glucose (<30 mg/dL) suggests the presence of septic peritonitis.76 Peritoneal fluid cytology will typically reflect a septic process, with abnormalities ranging from the presence of bacteria or plant material to degenerate neutrophils (Fig. 3-7\n). If GI contents or plant material are evident, the clinician should take care to differentiate between GI rupture and enterocentesis. At sampling, alterations in TNCC and cytology should indicate peritonitis; enterocentesis can result in an elevated TNCC within 4 hours.75 If a differentiation cannot be clearly made, a sample should be taken from an alternate location, preferably with ultrasound guidance. In postfoaling mares, the percentage of neutrophils in the peritoneal fluid can be increased for up to 7 days, but the total protein and TNCC should remain within normal limits.77\n",

Broad-spectrum coverage should be instituted pending results of peritoneal fluid culture and sensitivity. If positive results are obtained, therapy can be adjusted accordingly. A typical initial regimen includes penicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole to cover gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic spectrums, respectively. Because many Bacteroides species are resistant to \u03b2-lactam antimicrobials, metronidazole should be included in the antimicrobial therapy plan if anaerobic involvement is suspected. Enrofloxacin may replace gentamicin in the treatment regimen if warranted. The lipophilic nature of enrofloxacin can provide increased penetration into the peritoneal cavity. Neonatal foals with peritonitis should receive an antimicrobial regimen similar to that suggested for adults, although amikacin is frequently substituted for gentamicin because of increased sensitivity of commonly isolated organisms.78 A combination of azithromycin or clarithromycin plus rifampin provides reasonable coverage for older foals or weanlings, because Streptococcus and R. equi are often associated with disease in these populations if a primary GI lesion is not suspected.78 Although A. equuli is typically sensitive to either penicillin or trimethoprim-sulfonamide combinations, initial broad-spectrum coverage with penicillin and gentamicin is suggested pending culture results because of the resistance of some isolates.70\n",
