[2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Epidemiological investigations revealed that the index patients for each of these clusters had stayed on the ninth floor of a hotel in Hong Kong on 21-22 February (Figure 1 ). Further investigation indicated that the likely source of the outbreak was a physician from Guandong Province (Case A) who stayed on the same hotel floor on 21 February. This physician had cared for patients affected by the respiratory disease outbreak and he had been symptomatic with a febrile, respiratory illness since 15 February. This dramatic chain of transmission brought to the world's attention this new respiratory disease, called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and clearly illustrated the potential for SARS to spread extensively from a single infected person and to rapidly disseminate globally through air travel. The WHO issued an historic global alert 7 and, together with its international partners, initiated a rapid and intense response to this global public health emergency. The response led within 2 weeks to the identification of the aetiological agent, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), [8] [9] [10] [11] and to a series of decisive and effective containment efforts that interrupted the last chain of human transmission in less than 4 months. 12 In this article, we review what has been learned about the aetiological agent and its pathogenesis and pathology, clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis plus strategies for control of SARS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 319, "end": 322, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 323, "end": 326, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 327, "end": 330, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 331, "end": 334, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 335, "end": 338, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1443, "end": 1446, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1447, "end": 1450, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1451, "end": 1455, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1456, "end": 1460, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 502, "end": 511, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}, {"text": "SARS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-stranded, RNA virus in the Coronaviridae family ( Figure 2 ).

SARS-CoV was first cultured in Vero E6 cells from autopsy tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage, and nasal swab samples obtained from patients hospitalized in Hong Kong, Canada, Germany, and Singapore, with identification by electron microscopy and complete genomic sequencing.

Studies have also demonstrated the presence of antibody to SARS-CoV or a SARS-CoV-like virus in a small proportion of healthy adults in Hong Kong who had sera banked in May 2001, at least 2 years prior to the SARS outbreak. 21 This finding suggests that SARS may have been transmitted periodically in the past from animals to humans and the virus may have evolved and adapted to human infection and transmission 22 or that chance events resulting in efficient transmission led to the outbreak in 2003. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was recently identified as a functional SARS-CoV receptor, 23 and ACE2 is efficiently expressed in lung, heart, kidney, and gastrointestinal tissue in humans. SARS-CoV has been isolated in cell culture in autopsy specimens from lung, intestinal, and kidney tissue of patients who died of SARS. 24,25 SARS-CoV RNA can also be detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays in the plasma and serum of more than 50% of patients during the first week of illness. 26 Pathological findings in the lungs of SARS patients during the first 10 days of illness include pneumocyte proliferation and desquamation, hyaline membrane formation, mixed inflammatory infiltrate, and intra-alveolar oedema. 27, 28 Increased numbers of interstitial and alveolar macrophages, with focal haemophagocytosis in interstitial macrophages, have also been described. In cases of longer duration, diffuse alveolar damage, squamous metaplasia, and multinucleated giant cells, of macrophage origin, are observed.

The most common initial symptom is fever, often accompanied by headache, myalgias, malaise, chills, and rigor. Respiratory symptoms typically do not begin until 2-7 days after onset of fever, but may be present at onset in up to one-third of patients. Lower respiratory tract symptoms are common and typically include a non-productive cough with later onset of dyspnoea. Upper respiratory symptoms such as rhinorrhoea and sore throat are seen in less than 25% of patients. Diarrhoea has been reported at presentation in approximately 25% of patients, although this symptom was observed in as many as 73% of all patients affected by an outbreak at an apartment complex in Hong Kong that is believed to have resulted from fecal-oral/respiratory transmission of SARS-CoV. 33 Respiratory signs such as rales and rhonchi are present in less than one-third of cases, and their severity often does not correlate with the findings seen on chest radiographs. Elderly patients and those with underlying chronic illnesses such as renal failure sometimes present with atypical symptoms, including the absence of fever. 34 In general, SARS appears to be milder in children. 35, 36 Haematological abnormalities include lymphopaenia (70-90% of patients), thrombocytopaenia (30-50%), prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (40-60%), and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (70-90%), alanine or aspartate aminotransferases (20-30%), and creatinine phosphokinase (30-40%).

Some 15-25% of patients with SARS-CoV disease require mechanical ventilation, and about half of these people die despite ventilation therapy.

Health care facilities were severely affected and transmission in hospitals was a major factor in the amplification of outbreaks. In addition to health care workers, who accounted for 21% of all cases globally, other patients on the same ward as SARS patients and visitors to the hospital were affected. For example, of 74 cases reported from 15 April to 9 June in Toronto, Canada, 39% occurred among health care workers, 38% resulted from exposure during hospitalization, and 23% occurred among hospital visitors. 47 After health care facilities, households of SARS patients were the second most common setting of SARS-CoV transmission. Surveys in Hong Kong and Singapore indicated that 6-8% of people in the households of SARS patients may have been secondarily infected. 48, 49 The risk of transmission was greatest among those involved in direct patient care or other close contact with the patient. Transmission to casual and social contacts appears to be uncommon, but secondary cases have been documented after exposures in the workplace and on airplanes and other conveyances. 50, 51 The epidemiology of SARS outbreaks suggests that SARS-CoV is transmitted primarily through droplets and close personal contact, a conclusion that is supported by the finding that surgical masks confer protection against infection. 51, 52 Studies documenting stability of the virus for days in the environment raise the possibility of fomite transmission, and in a few instances, possible transmission by small-particle aerosols cannot be excluded. In particular, aerosol-generating medical procedures (e.g. endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy) may be associated with an increased risk of transmission in health care settings. [53] [54] [55] [56] Given that profuse watery diarrhoea is seen in a significant proportion of patients and SARS-CoV can be shed in large quantities in stool, faeces remain a possible source of virus and fecal-oral or fecal-respiratory spread are the leading hypotheses for a large outbreak affecting more than 300 people at an apartment complex in Hong Kong. 9 Mathematical modelling studies indicate that each SARS case infects an average of two to four people. [57] [58] [59] However, some SARS patients are very efficient in transmitting SARS-CoV to susceptible people under certain circumstances, leading to socalled 'super-spreading events'. 51, [53] [54] [55] [56] 60 Super-spreading events have occurred in a number of settings, including the hotel in Hong Kong, from which the SARS outbreak disseminated globally, and hospitals in many locations. The factors contributing to super-spreading events are not completely understood but may be related to the inherently greater infectiousness of some patients, alternative modes of transmission, or the exposure of large numbers of contacts in an environment conducive to transmission.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1097, "end": 1100, "text": "48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1408, "end": 1411, "text": "50,", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1646, "end": 1649, "text": "51,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2043, "end": 2047, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2048, "end": 2052, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2053, "end": 2057, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2058, "end": 2062, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2507, "end": 2511, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2512, "end": 2516, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2517, "end": 2521, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 2691, "end": 2694, "text": "51,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2695, "end": 2699, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2700, "end": 2704, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2705, "end": 2709, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2710, "end": 2714, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epidemiology"}, {"text": "Asymptomatic SARS-CoV infections have been documented, 61 but they appear to be uncommon and their epidemiological significance in disease transmission has not been established.
