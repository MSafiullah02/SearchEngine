Testing for COVID-19 is mainly being done among at-risk individuals (eg, those with influenza-like symptoms, people who have had contact with an individual testing positive for COVID-19, health-care professionals, or those with a travel history to an affected region),1 thus an accurate value for how many individuals are truly infected is not known. Since at-risk individuals are not representative of the general population, it is impossible to obtain the true prevalence of COVID-19 in the population. Yet, establishing this value is vital to understand the morbidity and mortality risk in the population, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as India, which cannot absorb the socioeconomic and public-health fallout resulting from national shutdowns.",

The minimum required sample size increases to just over 15 000 under a rarer scenario of 0\u00b71% prevalence and decreases to about 1500 if the anticipated prevalence is 1%. Should the anticipated prevalence of COVID-19 be any higher than 1%, the minimum sample size needed to reliably estimate the true prevalence would be smaller and, therefore, fewer resources would be needed.",
