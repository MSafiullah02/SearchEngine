However, the development of effective vaccine for this novel virus would take a few months. Thus it is urgent to identify some potentially effective old drugs that can be used immediately. Fortunately, some compounds that can inhibit coronavirus in vitro have been reported. In this study, the coronavirus-specific dataset was used to fine-tune our pre-trained multi-task deep model. Next we used the re-trained model to select available commercial drugs against targeted proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The results show that abacavir, a powerful nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor used to treat HIV, is predicted to have high binding affinity with several proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Almitrine mesylate and roflumilast which are used for respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are also predicted to have inhibitory effect. Overall, ten drugs are listed as potential inhibitors and the important sites for these binding by our model are exhibited. We hope these results would be useful in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Since December 2019, cases with pneumonia of unknown cause have been reported in Wuhan, China [1] . A novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the infections, which is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans [1, 2] . Similar to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory diseases and is capable of spreading from person to person. As of March 2 2020, there have been more than 87,000 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide, including more than 2900 deaths. Unfortunately, the development of effective vaccine against such novel virus would take a few months. Thus it is urgent to find some effective approved drugs that can be used quickly, which is \"drug-repurposing\". As a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA beta-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 encodes structural, non-structural and accessory proteins. Among these, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 3-chymotrypsin-like (3CL) protease, papain-like protease, helicase and spike glycoprotein are supposed to be the main targets. Several compounds that targeted these viral proteins and inhibited coronavirus in vitro have been reported and moved into clinical trials [3] . For example, remdesivir is an approved HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor, which has broad-spectrum activities against RNA viruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but showed less effective in a Ebola clinical trial [4] [5] [6] . Recent reports showed that remdesivir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with EC50=0.77\u03bcM [7] , and was used to treat a SARS-CoV-2 infected patient in the United States [8] .",

Task-specific layers use the joint representation to learn the weights of specific blocks based on specific tasks. In this study, two related tasks are defined: binary classification and regression. More details would be added in the next version. This model was previously trained by large amounts of data from various heterogeneous protein-ligand datasets (unpublished).
