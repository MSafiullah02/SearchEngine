This, together with the need to alter health-care utilisation during the pandemic, has led to rationing of endoscopic resources in this patient population. However, there are currently no specific endoscopic recommendations for patients affected by IBD based on direct evidence in the midst of the pandemic. Patients with IBD have been recommended to follow the general public health measures outlined by the WHO.8 Patients with IBD, especially those on systemic corticosteroids, thiopurine, and biologics, are considered to be moderate-to-high risk patients who are susceptible to COVID-19 and its complications. The general strategy expressed by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG), the International Organization for the study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD), the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO), and the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) is to reduce contact with health-care settings and thus possible exposure to COVID-19: all non-essential endoscopic procedures including colon cancer screening and those for patients with suspected gastrointestinal cancers have been cancelled, as these represent a risk for both patients and health-care personnel in an overstretched health-care environment.9, 10 Only emergency endoscopies are permitted.11\n",

Of note, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in the USA reported a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting on admission to hospital and then passed two loose bowel movements.13 In a study from China, 103 (50\u00b75%) of 204 patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, including anorexia, diarrhoea, and vomiting.15 If a patient has gastrointestinal symptoms that precede or follow fever, fatigue, and dry cough, a throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed to rule out infection.

Patients with COVID-19 could have leucopenia (particularly lymphopenia) and thrombocytopenia,21 while patients with a flare-up of ulcerative colitis usually have normal or higher than normal leucocytes and lymphocytes and increased platelet count. If patients also present with respiratory symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnoea), or myalgia or fatigue,3 or they had contact with SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, or have travelled from areas deemed to be of high risk for COVID-19 in the previous 14 days, a chest CT scan, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection in the respiratory tract with a nasopharyngeal swab,22 or both, should be done to screen for infection. In all cases, standard stool tests should be done for intestinal bacteria (Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli) and for C difficile toxin, and a blood test for cytomegalovirus DNA should also be done to allow differential diagnosis with other causes of diarrhoea.20\n",

However, cross-sectional imaging is more worthwhile in patients with Crohn's disease with partial obstructive symptoms, and endoscopy should be avoided if possible. Nevertheless, in patients known to have post-operative ileocolonic stricture requiring periodic endoscopic balloon dilatation, colonoscopy might be urgently necessary if these patients present with increasing sub-acute obstructive episodes. Medical treatment might alleviate a stricture with a predominantly inflammatory component, but 40% of patients might require urgent surgery for malignancy or benign stricture,28 which could be challenging in the pandemic situation.

Therefore, all patients, including those with IBD, should be considered as high-risk patients before undergoing urgent endoscopy. Risk should be determined on the basis of a chest CT scan, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swab, or both, to rule out infection, and results should be double-checked. We recommend a careful evaluation of patients before their entry to the endoscopic unit.

In all other situations, endoscopy could be deferred. However, postponed endoscopies may need to be prioritised according to a plan after routine endoscopies become feasible again in the post-pandemic period. All procedures should be performed with stringent safety precautions and PPE, since all endoscopies can generate aerosol droplets and pose a risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",
