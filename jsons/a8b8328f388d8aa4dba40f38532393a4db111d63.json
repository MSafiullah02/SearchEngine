For many diseases, Syrian golden hamsters have emerged as an ideal animal model due to their low cost, small size, ease of handling, and ability to accurately reflect disease progression in humans. Despite the increasing use and popularity of hamsters, there remains a lack of available reagents for studying hamster immune responses. Without suitable reagents for assessing immune responses, researchers are left to examine clinical signs and disease pathology. This becomes an issue for the development of vaccine and treatment options where characterizing the type of immune response generated is critical for understanding protection from disease. Despite the relative lack of reagents for use in hamsters, significant advances have been made recently with several hamster specific immunologic methods being developed. Here we discuss the progress of this development, with focus on classical methods used as well as more recent molecular methods. We outline what methods are currently available for use in hamsters and what is readily used as well as what limitations still exist and future perspectives of reagent and assay development for hamsters.

The first steps in developing intervention strategies involve establishing a small animal model for study of the disease, typically in rodents where mice are the most common model due to their low cost, ease of handling, availability of reagents, and potential for genetic manipulation. Despite their prominence and widespread use, there are many instances where mice are not suitable candidates for a disease model and alternative model is necessary. The guidelines for selecting an appropriate animal model have been outlined by the Canadian Council for Animal Care (CCAC) (Animal Care 1997) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (FDA 2015) . A model should be chosen such that the disease is pathophysiologically similar to the human condition in terms of onset, progression, symptoms, pathology, and disease outcome (FDA 2015) .

There are many advantages to using hamsters as a disease model. They are outbred animals, allowing for disease modelling with more genetic diversity than inbred mice. Also, the requirements for housing of hamsters is similar to that of mice and rats, and facilities designed for housing rodents can typically accommodate hamsters without the need for additional equipment. Hamsters can be cohoused in small cages, which is a significant advantage over other alternative disease models such as guinea pigs and ferrets. These advantages are why many consider hamsters a superior alternative to other small animals for use in research. For the development of vaccines and therapeutic approaches, some consider hamsters a higher standard as small animal model than mice and as such hamsters have been utilized in a wide range of models, from those examining diabetes, atherosclerosis, neural plasticity, to cancer (Table 1) (Bhathena et al. 2011; Dillard et al. 2010; Jov\u00e9 et al. 2013; Staffend and Meisel 2012; Woods et al. 2015; Vijayalingam et al. 2014 ). However, the use of hamsters for models of pathogenic human diseases may be the most valuable due to comparable disease progression seen in hamsters to that of humans for many infectious diseases including bacteria, viruses, and parasites (Dondji et al. 2008 ; da Silva-Couto et al. 2015; Kuehne et al. 2014; Safronetz et al. 2012) . Specifically, hamsters are used as a disease model for many high consequence pathogens such as bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, henipaviruses, flaviviruses, alphaviruses, filoviruses, and SARS-corona virus (Table 1 ) (Safronetz et al. 2009 Brown et al. 2011; Schountz et al. 2015; DeBuysscher et al. 2013; Gowen and Holbrook 2008; Steele and Twenhafel 2010; Ebihara et al. 2012; Gowen et al. 2010; Roberts et al. 2010) . Additionally, hamsters can be used for the evaluation of vaccines and therapeutic treatments against these viruses. In some cases, as with Andes virus, hamsters are the only lethal model of the disease . The value of hamsters as an animal model is research is only recently being realized. The popularity of hamsters used for infectious disease research has increased significantly the last several years (Fig. 1) .

The complete sequencing of the hamster genome has been performed at the BROAD Institute (NCBI BioProject 77669) and assembly of the hamster genome only recently completed (http://www.genome.gov/27557963). This recent completion will hopefully lead to a surge in the development of hamster specific research tools. Currently, there are 874 cDNA sequences or expressed sequence tags (ESTs) available from the hamster genome in the NCBI-dbEST database (Boguski et al. 1993) . The lack of available sequence data and resulting insufficient tools for molecular biology in hamsters has hamstrung scientists who are looking to use them as a disease model. In addition to the insufficient sequence data for hamsters until very recently, the characterization of many immune-specific markers in the hamster remains to be done. The number of these markers that have been described in the mouse, including cell surface markers, transcription factors, signaling proteins, cytokines, chemokines, and even secreted effectors molecules dwarfs the work that has been done in almost every other species, including hamsters. Additionally, monoclonal antibodies against nearly all of the described immunological markers in mice can be readily found commercially, whereas monoclonal antibodies against hamster specific immune markers are almost completely non-existent.

For example, in human models qRT-PCR has been employed for the detection of innate cytokines and transcription factors involved in immune responses in cells infected with SARS-coronavirus, the detection of upregulated genes implicated in immune escape in circulating tumor cells, and evaluating immune responses generated in patients given the live attenuated yellow fever vaccine (Zielecki et al. 2013; Steinert et al. 2014; Gaucher et al. 2008) . Similarly, in mice, qRT-PCR has been used to describe the mechanisms of immune activation in certain vaccine models, to determine the transcription factors involved in dendritic cell mediated presentation of antigen and the subsequent activation of T cells, to investigate the mechanisms behind macrophage polarization, and to evaluate the role of certain subsets of T cells in infectious disease models (Pollard et al. 2013; Seillet et al. 2013; Davis et al. 2013; Stross et al. 2012) .

Recently, a panel of TaqMan\u00ae prime/probe assays for 51 specifically targeted genes in the hamster that were chosen out of a set of more than 800 reference mRNA sequences in GenBank was described (Zivcec et al. 2011) . Each are involved in either pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, innate immune responses, T cell responses, as well as non-immune pathways such as apoptosis, cell junction, or coagulation responses in the hamster (Zivcec et al. 2011) . Additionally, the validation of an appropriate housekeeping gene for use in qRT-PCR assays in the hamster was simultaneously performed, with ribosomal protein L18 (RPL18) identified as the most stable of the housekeeping genes tested among \u03b2-actin, \u03b2-2-microglobulin, and Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (Zivcec et al. 2011 ). Consequently, the use of qRT-PCR in hamster models as an immunological tool has increased greatly. qRT-PCR has been utilized in hamster models studying disease caused by Andes virus (Safronetz et al. 2011a, b; Prescott et al. 2013) , ebola virus hemorrhagic fever The development of specific primer/probe sets for use in qRT-PCR in hamsters has improved upon the limited options that are available for researchers who are looking to use hamsters as a small animal model. This advancement allows for detection of a broad range of immune and cellular factors and has been crucial to expanding the use of hamsters as an animal model. That said, while qRT-PCR is in all likelihood the best immunological tool available in hamsters currently, it is still an assay that has its considerable disadvantages. First, the number of immunerelated genes that have been sequenced and their mRNA sequences entered into GenBank is still relatively low. The panel of primers that was validated contained only 51 genes that played a role in host immune responses (Table 2) (Zivcec et al. 2011 ). While many of the genes reported by play an important role in host immunity, the number of immune factors that can be assays pales in comparison to what is available in mouse and human assays. Second, while the study of the immune-related genes involved in disease systems can provide valuable insight into the class of immunity generated or what type of immunity is needed for protection against certain pathogens, the relative amount of mRNA present does not always correlate directly with the amount of expressed protein (Overbergh et al. 2003) . In many instances, the presence of expressed protein will be very small, whereby qRT-PCR and relative gene expression must be used instead. In these instances, and particularly in using qRT-PCR for analyzing the expression of immune-related genes in hamsters, a discrepancy between mRNA and protein levels should be considered (Overbergh et al. 2003) . In spite of this, there is evidence that there is a good correlation between mRNA and protein levels in some instances (Hein et al. 2001; Blaschke et al. 2000) . Finally, the methods used for collection of tissues in hamsters for analysis by qRT-PCR in most models do not allow for the evaluation of specific gene expression in individual cell types. Perhaps the most important flaw to consider when using qRT-PCR for analyzing the expression of immune-related genes is that hamster tissues are often harvested and total RNA is extracted from the tissues for analysis by qRT-PCR (Safronetz et al. 2011a; Prescott et al. 2013; Chattopadhyay et al. 2014) . A lack of hamster specific antibodies does not allow for the isolation of individual cell types for analysis of gene expression. Therefore, the detection of antigen-specific immune responses at the individual cell level is nearly impossible, leaving only systemic responses and total cytokine, chemokine, and other markers to be detected. This can cause issues when attempting to detect primary and secondary immune responses, what types of innate cells play a role in protection against pathogens, and determining what the correlates of protection are against certain diseases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 320, "end": 340, "text": "(Zivcec et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 556, "end": 576, "text": "(Zivcec et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 890, "end": 909, "text": "(Zivcec et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1095, "end": 1122, "text": "(Safronetz et al. 2011a, b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1123, "end": 1144, "text": "Prescott et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1968, "end": 1987, "text": "(Zivcec et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 2515, "end": 2538, "text": "(Overbergh et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2868, "end": 2891, "text": "(Overbergh et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 3013, "end": 3031, "text": "(Hein et al. 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3032, "end": 3053, "text": "Blaschke et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 3473, "end": 3497, "text": "(Safronetz et al. 2011a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 3498, "end": 3519, "text": "Prescott et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 3520, "end": 3546, "text": "Chattopadhyay et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1958, "end": 1967, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "qRT-PCR"}, {"text": "Until more hamster specific monoclonal antibodies become commercially available, qRT-PCR for determining the relative expression levels of immune response genes is one of the best tools at the researcher's disposal today.

Although originally described as a method for the detection of IgG antibodies, ELISAs have subsequently been developed and optimized for detection of a wide variety of proteins, the most common being cytokines that can be detected in biological samples (Hornbeck 1991) . For species like mice, non-human primates, and humans a large number of commercially available kits can be obtained for a reasonable price for the detection of nearly every important cytokine or chemokine. Alternatively, antibodies against cytokines from these species are readily available as well, including antibodies with enzymatic conjugates, allowing for the optimization of individual protocols to each researcher's liking. In hamsters however, these antibodies for the detection of cytokines are not available. A study examining cross-reactivity of hamster proteins reported that out of 64 antibody-based assays including luminex and ELISA for the detection of cytokines and chemokines in various species, 14 showed significant cross-reactivity with hamster proteins (Zivcec et al. 2011) . Out of eight ELISA kits that were tested, only three showed an acceptable level of cross-reactivity with hamster proteins (Zivcec et al. 2011 ). Due to the high level of sequence homology of the genes for these proteins in the species tested compared with hamsters, this low percentage of crossreactivity is surprising.

The lack of antibodies that can detect hamster specific cytokines limits the use of both ELISA and ELISPOT for cytokine detection in hamster models.

True to its original use, ELISAs can be used to quantify the presence of hamster IgM and IgG. Out of the limited number of commercially available anti-hamster antibodies, antihamster IgM and IgG are available and have been used to show the presence of antigen specific antibodies in various hamster models (Safronetz et al. 2009; Prescott et al. 2015; . In general, the use of a direct ELISA assay is ideal for detection of antibodies in the serum of hamsters. Therefore a recombinant or purified antigen is necessary to coat ELISA plates before the detection of specific antibodies in serum can be achieved. This has been performed in models for hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome caused by Andes virus (Safronetz et al. 2009 ), Ebola hemorrhagic fever (Prescott et al. 2015) , and MERS-CoV (de Wit et al. 2013) among others. This has provided a valuable tool for the evaluation of humoral immunity in hamsters in response to infectious agents. Despite the value of being able to detect IgM and IgG in hamsters, these are the only two isotypes for which there are currently available antibodies against. The detection of different isotypes such as IgG1 and IgG2 would be invaluable to researchers in evaluating the immune response given the other limited options available in hamsters.

The specificity and sensitivity of flowcytometry, along with the advent of large panels capable of recognizing over a dozen fluorescent markers on cells make it one of the most valuable tools for immunological analyses. For hamsters, there are currently no monoclonal antibodies against cell surface markers specific to hamster cells for use in flowcytometry. However, many studies have used cross-reactive antibodies against cell surface markers of mice and rats for use in flowcytometry Hammerbeck and Hooper 2012) . Hammerbeck and Hooper reported that out of a panel consisting of 52 commercially available antibodies for use in flowcytometry, four were able to identify hamster cells (Hammerbeck and Hooper 2012 ).

Additionally, the few antibodies that are available that cross-react are limited to cell surface proteins on T and B cells. This results in an inability to determine activation status, cell subset, or identify other non-T and B cells like macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and NK cells. As with ELISA and ELISPOT assays in hamsters, the lack of antibodies against hamster-specific cytokines prevents using flowcytometry to detect cytokine producing cells by intracellular staining for phenotyping of the immune response. This is a major limitation on the use of flowcytometry in hamster models. Finally, the use of anti-mouse CD4 and anti-rat CD8\u03b2 antibodies for use in hamsters must be done in conjunction with anti-mouse/rat MHC II to allow for the exclusion of myeloid lineage cells expressing either CD4 or CD8\u03b2, which has shown to be the case in mice (Hammerbeck and Hooper 2012) . Fortunately the combination of these antibodies has been shown to be effective in identifying CD4 and CD8 T cells in hamsters due to the lack of binding of cells by both anti-mouse CD4 or antirat CD8\u03b2 and anti-mouse/rat MHC II (Hammerbeck and Hooper 2012) . Overall, the use of flowcytometry in hamsters in severely limited due to the lack hamster-specific antibodies.

The use of specific antibodies allows for the detection within fixed tissues of bacteria, viruses, certain cell types such as lymphocytes, and cellular markers of disease pathology. While immunohistochemistry has important applications in diagnostics, in animal models of disease, it is particularly useful for assessing pathology in affected tissues, and can detect the present of tissue infiltrating immune cells that may be causing immunopathogenesis during the course of disease. Immunohistochemistry in hamsters for assessing disease pathology has been a popular technique due to the lack of reagents available for classical immunological methods. It has been used to examine the course of disease in many infectious disease models including Andes virus, Sin Nombre virus, Chikungunya virus, Nipah virus, and Ebola virus DeBuysscher et al. 2013; Ebihara et al. 2012; Safronetz et al. 2011b; Bosco-Lauth et al. 2015) . It is also useful in non-infectious disease models in hamsters such as cancer and encephalopathic diseases (Woods et al. 2015; Clouse et al. 2015; Elder et al. 2013) . While the use of this technique in hamsters is typically limited to examining preserved tissues that display disease pathology, the advantages are that cross sections of entire tissues can be visualized to give a more representative image of disease tropism and the presence of immune cells or of particular pathogens can easily be detected (Schacht and Kern 2015) . As with other immunological methods in hamsters, the detection of most immune cells is limited to few crossreactive antibodies available, and antibodies against common cell surface markers found in many tissues are not available or their crossreactivity with antibodies against these markers in other species has not been assessed. Other inherent limitations of immunohistochemistry include the alteration of antigens during the fixation process, the relative insensitivity of the assay as compared to other techniques like ELISA and PCR, and the technical demands involved in the procedure (Schacht and Kern 2015) . Particularly in the case of pathogens that require high containment facilities, the procedure for fixation of tissues can be up to several weeks long, increasing the possibility of altered tissues when best results are obtained as soon after euthanization as possible. Despite these issues, the value of using immunohistochemistry in hamster models is the ability to examine multiple tissues that impacted during the course of disease, determining specific tissue tropism of pathogens by visualizing pathogens in infected tissues, and studying possible immune cells infiltration into tissues that could be contributing to immunopathogenesis during certain diseases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 129, "end": 152, "text": "(Schacht and Kern 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 367, "end": 390, "text": "(Schacht and Kern 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 391, "end": 418, "text": "K\u20ac ohler and Milstein 1975)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1247, "end": 1271, "text": "DeBuysscher et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1272, "end": 1292, "text": "Ebihara et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1293, "end": 1316, "text": "Safronetz et al. 2011b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1317, "end": 1341, "text": "Bosco-Lauth et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1451, "end": 1470, "text": "(Woods et al. 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1471, "end": 1490, "text": "Clouse et al. 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1509, "text": "Elder et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1853, "end": 1876, "text": "(Schacht and Kern 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2470, "end": 2493, "text": "(Schacht and Kern 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"text": "In recent years, transcriptome sequencing and analysis has been utilized to provide sets of mRNA that are expressed in a given species, help provide insights into the expression profiles of these species, and for the development of microarrays for the detection of gene expression (Tchitchek et al. 2014; Ying et al. 2015) .

The ability of kinases to phosphorylate proteins is critical in cellular signalling, and allows for rapid responses to environmental stimuli such as stress or infection (Arsenault et al. 2011; Falcinelli et al. 2015) .

Kinome analysis involves synthesizing peptides representing phosphorylation sites on hundreds of proteins that are immobilized onto an array surface (Arsenault et al. 2011) . Samples containing cellular kinases phosphorylate the immobilized peptides, which can then be visualized to determine the level of relative phosphorylation and the activity of the kinases in the sample (Arsenault et al. 2011) .
