Evidently, lipids contribute to the creation of ILVs out of MVBs, but, on the other hand, ESCRTs are involved in cargo sorting (Batrakova & Kim, 2015) . Moreover, plasma membrane proteins and cytoplasmic molecules are incorporated into the exosomes during its biogenesis, but this mechanism is not fully understood. Exosomes share some structural elements irrespective of the origin of the cell that produced them, while some molecules are specific to a cell-derived exosome and reflect the physiological state of the cell that produced them (Schorey & Bhatnagar, 2008; Vlassov et al., 2012) . These nanocarriers also confer an endocytic pathway for protein export through scission from the limiting endosome, which result in cell type specific proteins enclosed in the membrane of the parent cell, with the unique property of homing selectivity and the same topological orientation (Green, Langer, & Anderson, 2008; Simpson et al., 2008) . These cell type-specific proteins determine an exosome's functionality (Simpson et al., 2008) . Hence, transmembrane proteins, such as lactadherin, lysosome associated membrane protein-2B (LAMP-2b), platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), heat shock protein, and annexins are common to all exosomes and can be utilized for targeted gene delivery associated with homing peptides on the surface of exosomes (Alvarez-Erviti et al., 2011; Vlassov et al., 2012; Xitong & Xiaorong, 2016) . In addition, exosomes have specific proteins that distinguish them from microvesicles, such as alix, TSG101, and tetraspanins (CD9, CD63) (Simpson et al., 2008) . Initially, exosomes were thought to be a cellular mechanism to remove unwanted components. However, exosomes are now considered as a natural carrier of many signaling molecules, and thus play an important role in the pathogenesis of many diseases involved with the immune system, sepsis, cardiovascular, and cancer (Ogorevc, Kralj-Iglic, & Veranic, 2013) . Furthermore, exosomes and their modified variants can be used as vectors for cancer therapy by the delivery of drugs, microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), mitochondrial DNA, genomic DNA, and recombinant proteins (Banizs et al., 2014) . Therefore, tumor-associated exosomes may represent an important biological defense and regulatory mechanism during cancer development and progression. Moreover, exosome-mediated delivery of cellderived cargos might provide tissue-specific biomarkers which would allow for the diagnosis of cancer growth at early stages, heart disease, pregnancy, and infections (Th\u00e9ry et al., 2002) . In this review, we have chosen to focus on different delivery approaches of noncoding RNAs and therapeutic drugs using exosomes.",

            "text": "RNAi-based therapy, which is performed with both small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), has been demonstrated to be one of the most important strategies for target-specific gene silencing (Kooijmans, Vader, van Dommelen, van Solinge, & Schiffelers, 2012) . However, in spite of major advances in the field of RNAi, only a few clinical trials have been performed. Poor bioavailability, rapid hydrolysis, and the inability to cross biological barriers, such as bloodbrain barrier, are major concerns for the successful clinical application of siRNAs (Schorey & Bhatnagar, 2008) . Investigations have revealed that naked siRNA has a natural affinity for gene silencing in the spleen, kidney, and liver. Conversely, exosome-encapsulated siRNAs have no affinity to the aforementioned tissues, but undergo a more specific uptake (Ogorevc et al., 2013) . It requires two critical steps to efficiently deliver miRNAs or siRNAs to a specific tissue while maintaining their expression capacity; targeting to the desired tissue and subsequent delivery across the cell membrane (Alvarez-Erviti et al., 2011) . Many siRNA and miRNA delivery methods have been developed based on viral and non-viral vectors used for gene delivery. Although, viral delivery generally leads to long-term gene silencing in the target tissue, the safety of viral vectors is still a matter of concern. Viral delivery has inherent drawbacks, for example, it can result in the activation of complement or coagulant factors in the blood circulation. Moreover, viruses can be recognized by preexisting antibodies in the blood stream. There are also safety issues regarding dysregulation of gene expression in the desired tissue, which might lead to malignant transformation and several other complications, thus limiting the application of viral vectors in clinical practice (Green et al., 2008; Hornung et al., 2008) . Non-viral delivery systems involving synthetic carriers, such as polyethyleneimmine (PEI) nanoparticles or liposomes, are promising alternatives because of their ability to encapsulate siRNAs, protect them from degradation in the bloodstream, and facilitate cellular uptake. However, although non-viral delivery systems have surpassed safety concerns when compared to viral vectors, there are potential problems related to inadequate transfection efficiency, induction of a pro-inflammatory response, and apoptosis in vivo (Green et al., 2008; Hornung et al., 2008; Kooijmans et al., 2012) . Exosomes have some features that are common to liposomes including having a phospholipid bilayer and being composed of biocompatible substances (Dang Xitong, 2015) . It has been established that exosomes have benefits of a natural vehicle for transferring siRNAs with high target specificity and lack of immunologic reactions. This nanocarrier also has the properties of efficient uptake in host cells due to their unique composition of endogenously synthetized lipid, protein, and RNA, which is not found in other delivery systems (Kooijmans et al., 2012) . According to some reports, exosome-mediated delivery systems are well tolerated both in vitro and in vivo, as demonstrated by the MTT cytotoxicity test and immunological assessments (Ogorevc et al., 2013) . In comparison with other existing gene therapy vehicles, repeated administration of exosomes did not activate the host immune response (Hornung et al., 2008) . Hence, it has been suggested that exosomes have benefits of both synthetic nanocarriers and cell-mediated drug delivery systems, but lack most of their limitations.",

Thus, exosomes have the advantage of being a nano-sized, cell-based delivery system that is considered an effective vehicle for the targeted delivery of both endogenous and exogenous payloads (Green et al., 2008) . miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that control specific target mRNAs and inhibit gene expression at either the post-transcriptional or SHAHABIPOUR ET AL. | 1661 transcriptional level (Banizs et al., 2014) . In contrast to siRNAs that are well-known for sequence specificity and used to regulate the expression of one specific gene, miRNAs regulate functionality of several genes related to a signaling pathway or even multiple cross-talking signaling pathways. These can increase their potential for off-target effects (Adlakha & Saini, 2014; Kooijmans et al., 2012) . Similar to the limitations related to the delivery of siRNA, miRNA properties require a suitable delivery system. Endogenous miRNAs can be encapsulated into exosomes to protect them from endonuclease degradation. Although synthetic miRNAs have a short half-life in the blood stream, various chemical modifications can be utilized to improve their loading into exosomes (Dang Xitong, 2015; Kooijmans et al., 2012; Zhang, Wang, & Gemeinhart, 2013) .",

Although exosomes may be generated from many cell types (e.g., bone marrow, blood, monocytes, or macrophages), a few have been chosen for the delivery of drugs or short nucleic acids. Immature dendritic cells provide an untapped source of exosomes devoid of any T-cell activators and are a suitable source for vaccination purposes.

            "text": "These RNAs (miRNAs, modified miRNAs, and shRNA) were completely functional when incubated with recipient cells and resulted in target gene knockdown (Marcus & Leonard, 2013; Rechavi et al., 2009 ). This Cell-penetrating peptides (CPP-exosome) is a good example with which to improve the overall uptake efficiency of exosomes. CPP exosomes, in which a short cationic peptide is fused with Lamp2b and displayed on the surface of the exosome, may be employed as an appropriate cargo that enters cells through the shield of negative charges of the exosome (El-Andaloussi, Holm, & Langel, 2005) . Another strategy to introduce miRNAs into exosomes is transient transfection using commercial transfection reagents (Dang Xitong, 2015; Shtam et al., 2013) . Exosome display technology is another method to introduce exogenous siRNAs successfully into different kinds of human exosomes (Wahlgren et al., 2012) . To use exosomes as a potential therapeutic system, several issues need to be addressed. Studies have shown that exosomes can be easily cleared by the reticuluendothelial system (RES), since many of them accumulate in the liver 24 hr after injection into a mouse tail vein (Ohno et al., 2013) . Therefore, several strategies have been developed to target exosomes to specific cellular receptors. One approach to precise delivery of exosome-mediated cargo to a specific cell type is to harness a virus-derived protein or peptide to labeled exosomes. For instance, RVG-exosomes, which display a central nervous system-specific rabies viral glycoprotein, have the ability to deliver siRNA to neural cells by binding to the acetylcholine receptor. On the other hand, untagged exosomes deliver siRNAs to unintended tissues. Virusmodified exosomes represent a new approach to specific targeted delivery. Because there are many similarities between viruses and exosomes, exosomes may be modified by incorporating viral proteins, which may be exploited for specific targeting of the exosomes (Sun et al., 2010) . Viral-infected cells that incorporate viral factors like virus-encoded RNA into exosomes could be efficiently delivered into non-infected target cells. Studies have revealed an enhancement of exosomes released from the infection of cells with Rotavirus than non-infected with higher T-cell inhibition, while no viral product was detectable (Barreto et al., 2010) . These modified exosomes carrying viral proteins were incorporated into endogenously produced exosomes so as to increase the uptake and delivery of exosomes by the desired target (Alvarez-Erviti et al., 2011; Koppers-Lalic, Hogenboom, Middeldorp, & Pegtel, 2013) . For instance, EBV-infected B cells encoded BART miRNAs were transferred through exosomes to multiple uninfected recipient cells including monocyte-derived DC. These EBV-miRNAs accumulated in noninfected recipient cells via exosomes and caused suppression of EBV target genes (Pegtel et al., 2010) . Likewise, plasma exosomes, which were derived from the peripheral blood of healthy donors, were able to deliver siRNAs effectively into the target cells (human blood mononuclear cells) (Wahlgren et al., 2012) . Exosome-mimetics represent a viable alternative method to deliver miRNA and siRNA directly into the cytoplasm of target cells.",

Additionally, these exosome-mimetics are a promising nanotechnology to overcome the hurdle of exosome purification and low production yields (Jang & Gho, 2014) .

CDCs exosomes stimulated angiogenesis, induced cardiomyocyte proliferation, and reduced apoptosis in vitro. The capacity of these exosomes in regeneration was demonstrated in a chronic myocardial infarction model in rats and was attributed to the reduction of collagen deposition and inducing anti-fibrotic efficacy via paracrine mechanisms (Puri et al., 2009; Xitong & Xiaorong, 2016) . Exosomes derived from endothelial cells were suggested to be a promising strategy to combat atherosclerosis, since atherosclerosis is the fundamental cause of myocardial infarction and stroke. Systemic administration of exosomes of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) reduced atherosclerotic lesions in mice fed with a high-fat diet. HUVEC exosomes were found to be enriched in multiple miRNAs resulting in controlled target gene expression and a reduction in atherosclerotic lesions of mouse aorta (Mu et al., 2013) . In addition, exosomes derived from MSCs revealed drug-induced regeneration and cardioprotective paracrine effects against myocardial reperfusion or ischemia injury in liver-damaged mouse models, respectively (Ohno et al., 2013; Rechavi et al., 2009; van der Meel et al., 2014) .",

Additionally, reconstruction of hypoxic injury while preventing neovascularization, delays tumor development (Martinez & Andriantsitohaina, 2011) . Exosomes which are secreted from human CD34+ cells have angiogenic activity in isolated endothelial cells and in murine models of vessel growth and represent a significant paracrine effect for therapeutic angiogenesis and enhancing recovery from injury or ischemic disease (Sahoo et al., 2011). 10 | AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES Exosomes may also be useful in the treatment of autoimmune diseases in animal models. Kim et al. (2007) showed that the administration of exosomes derived from DCs expressing IL-4 were able to modify the activity of APC and T cells in vivo through a FasL/ Fas-dependent mechanism, and resulted in an effective treatment against collagen-induced arthritis by suppression of a delayed-type FIGURE 1 Schematic representation of the biogenesis of exosomes. Exosomes originate as endocytic vesicles through invagination of the cell membrane, which results in the formation of early exosomes and, subsequently, late exosome called MVBs. MVBs contain ILV which are formed from budding of the endosomal membrane and are called exosomes. When MVBs fuse with the plasma membrane, they give rise to the release of exosomes into the extracellular space. (A) Endosomal proteins such as CD9, Alix, and TSG101 may be incorporated into exosomes during their assembly to facilitate this process. (B) AGO2 and GW182 are two important components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which associate with MVBs so as to mediate miRNA sorting into exosomes. (C) Subsequent fusion of cell-derived exosomes with the plasma membrane through their CD9 (tetraspanin) interaction with surface glycoproteins on target cells gives rise to cytosolic delivery of the siRNA directly. This process is involved in the creation of temporary RNAi. (D) Exosomes originate from inward budding in the lumen of the MVB through which the cytoplasmic content from the cell of origin and also viral components, including mRNA and small noncoding RNA and viral glycoproteins are incorporated into the exosome, and then released as a selective cargo in viral-infected cells. These virus-modified exosomes display the original surface markers and cell membrane as the parent cells. (E) Bioengineered or virus-modified exosomes are designed to express a selective set of proteins and small, non-coding RNAs to target specific receptors. Exosomes then fuse with the endosomal membrane to release their non-coding RNAs into the cytoplasm so as to load siRNA into the RNAi (RISC) complex of the target cells in order to prevent mRNA translation into protein.

Development of an immune response to PEGylated drugs can result in the accelerated clearance of nanocarriers. For example, PEGylated liposomes lose their circulating properties in the 2nd week after systemic administration in mice(Hornung et al., 2008;Xitong & Xiaorong, 2016). It has been suggested that exosomes may have stealth properties that blunt their clearance by the immune system(Gibbings et al., 2009;Montecalvo et al., 2012;Mu et al., 2013).Exosomal drug formulations have been used to treat many diseases such as cancer, infection, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders(Xitong & Xiaorong, 2016). One of the first examples of the application of exosomes in drug delivery was in targeted delivery of the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin to mice with solid tumors. This study revealed a greater anti-tumor effect of targeted doxorubicinencapsulated exosomes compared with free doxorubicin at equivalent doses(Tian et al., 2014). The superiority of exosomal doxorubicin has also been shown versus liposomal doxorubicin, a finding that has been attributed to the natural orientation of exosomal membrane proteins and their capacity for efficient interaction with the receptors in the target cell plasma membrane(Adlakha & Saini, 2014;Hornung et al., 2008;Xitong & Xiaorong, 2016). Apart from efficacy, intravenous administration is less toxic compared with the fee drug due to the specific accumulation of exosomes in the tumor tissue.4 | NEUROLOGIC DISORDERSExosomes which are derived from mesenchymal stem cells are considered of therapeutic value for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, exosomes can be used in vivo as a vehicle to carry active neprilysin (NEP), the most important enzyme for \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptide plug degradation in the brain(Sun et al., 2010). MSCderived exosomes also decreased intracellular and extracellular A\u03b2 levels in the neuroblastoma cell line N2A in vitro. It has been demonstrated that MSC-derived exosomes have a neuroprotective effect against stroke due, in part, to changing the miRNA profile of exosomes during the stroke, and then subsequently modifying the expression of miRNAs that participate in the recovery following a stroke(Wahlgren et al., 2012). Exosomal formulations of catalase is a more versatile strategy to treat inflammatory and degenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD)(Kim, Bianco,",

It has been reported that transfer of DCs pulsed with Toxoplasma gondii antigens (TAg) to healthy mice induced protection against a virulent strain of T. gondii in an oral challenge, but it was difficult to obtain a sufficient quantity of DCs suitable for vaccination (Aline, Bout, Amigorena, Roingeard, & Dimier-Poisson, 2004; Beauvillain, Juste, Dion, Pierre, & Dimier-Poisson, 2009; Beauvillain, Ruiz, Guiton, Bout, & Dimier-Poisson, 2007).Murine bone marrow-derived DCs pulsed in vitro with intact diphtheria toxin (DT)-released exosomes, which upon injection into mice, induce IgG2b and IgG2a responses specific for DT(Colino &   Snapper, 2006). Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis stimulates macrophages to increase the release of exosomes and, it should be noted that microvesicles containing M. tuberculosis peptide-MHC-II complexes can produce antimicrobial T-cell responses(Ramachandra   et al., 2010;Singh, LeMaire, Tan, Zeng, & Schorey, 2011).",

Exosomes have been shown to be readily taken up by neuronal cells in vitro. In fact, a considerable quantity of exosomes was detected in the brains of mice with experimentally induced Parkinson's disease following intranasal administration of catalase-loaded exosomes. The catalase-loaded exosomes provided neuroprotective effects in both in vitro and in vivo models of PD",
