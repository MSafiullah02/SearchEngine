The underreporting of COVID-19 deaths in the state of Minas Gerais (MG), where is concentrated the second largest population of the country, reveals government unpreparedness, as there is a low capacity of testing in the population, which prevents the real understanding of the general panorama of Sars-Cov-2 dissemination. The goals of this research are to analyze the causes of deaths in the different Brazilian government databases (ARPEN and SINAN) and to assess whether there are sub-records shown by the unexpected increase in the frequency of deaths from causes clinically similar to COVID-19. A descriptive and quantitative analysis of the number of COVID-19 deaths and similar causes was made in different databases. Ours results demonstrate that the different official sources had a discrepancy of 209.23% between these data referring to the same period. There was also a 648.61% increase in SARS deaths in 2020, when compared to the average of previous years. Finally, it was shown that there was an increase in the rate of pneumonia and respiratory insufficiency (RI) by 5.36% and 5.72%, respectively. In conclusion, there is an underreporting of COVID-19 deaths in MG due to the unexplained excess of SARS deaths, Respiratory insufficiency and pneumonia compared to previous years.",

However, Brazil is far below the ideal number of tests for COVID-19, as there are not enough laboratory inputs to understand the overall panorama of the virus' spread. Furthermore, confirmatory molecular tests depend on the availability of imported reagents,whichare globally scarce, and on government investments that prioritize this strategy. This scenario leads Brazil to have a delay in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths confirmations. These aspects become more aggravated when the patient evolves to death, because the effectiveness of tests, for these cases, is even more difficult. In addition, the recommendation is to collect blood and sputum to perform the culture, since these samples have a higher viral loadconsidering the studies done to date [14] .",

In this perspective, there is a subjectivity bias, since the physician can attest or not the death from COVID-19 according to his clinical knowledge without the need of laboratory tests [21] . This finding corroborates with data from Hubei, China and Northern Italy, where mortality calculations were adjusted for the biases of preferential verification, symptomatic and severe cases, and delay in death records. An increase in the mortality rate was found, which confirms the existence of underreporting COVID-19 deaths in those regions [22] .",

Thus, one cannot only add up the deaths made available on the portal by the different diseases, because they would generate false over-notification. A thorough investigation must be made when considering each death and the causes that were cited in the death certificate [23] .
