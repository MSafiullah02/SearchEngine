Several research studies have been published about APP and their changes due to different inflammatory and noninflammatory conditions in birds (Nielsen et al., 1999; Henry et al., 2000; Barnes et al., 2001; Koutsos and Klasing, 2001; Juul-Madsen et al., 2003; Kokosharov, 2006) . However, the importance of and sensitivity toward the evaluation of APP and inflammatory cytokines in the diagnosis of infection and disease are not clearly known. Few research studies have been undertaken on changes of APP and sialic acid (SA) in IB with regard to finding the relationship between APP and sialic acid in IB. Based on this evidence, the present study was undertaken to evaluate alteration in concentrations of the acute phase proteins [haptoglobin (Hp) and serum amyloid A (SAA)], pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3), and the serum level of total sialic acid (TSA), lipid-bound sialic acid (LBSA), and protein-bound sialic acid (PBSA) in experimentally infected chicks by IBV isolate IRFIBV32 compared with healthy chicks.",

It was propagated in 10-d-old embryonating chicken eggs. The embryo lethal dose (ELD 50 ) was calculated according to the formula of Reed and Muench (1938) . Allantoic fluid containing 10 5 ELD 50 /0.1 mL of the virus was used to induce disease. The infected group was challenged intranasally at 20 d old. The remaining 20 birds were left as unchallenged control. Blood sampling was performed on all chicks via wing vein. All samples were collected prior to and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, and 20 d postinoculation (PI) into plane tubes. Sera were separated by centrifugation (for 15 min at 750 \u00d7 g and 25\u00b0C) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until assayed. A TaqMan real-time reverse-transcription PCR was used for early and accurate detection and quantify the viral RNA load of IBV isolate IRFIBV32 from infected chicken clinical samples at 1, 7, and 11 d PI. The cDNA synthesis from normalized RNA of positive samples was carried out using AccuPowder RT PreMix kit (BioNeer Corporation, Daejeon, South Korea) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. The reaction was performed with a mixture of 20 pmol of random hexamer and 20 pmol of reverse primer. The primer was specific to a highly conserved region of nucleocapsid protein gene of IBV that was described previously by Adzhar et al. (1996 ;  Table 1 ). The reaction mixture was incubated at 70\u00b0C for 5 min, then incubated at 42\u00b0C for 60 min, heated to 95\u00b0C for 5 min, cooled to 4\u00b0C, then stored at \u221270\u00b0C until assayed. The quantitative real-time PCR primers and TaqMan probe used in this study were described previously by Chousalkar et al. (2009;  Table 1 ). The primers amplified a 76-bp fragment in the N gene of IBV. The probe annealed to the part of the sequence amplified by 2 primers (Chousalkar et al., 2009 ). The assays were performed on a 48-well microtiter plate of Bio-Rad MiniOpticon System. The reaction mixture contained 5 \u03bcL of target cDNA, 1 \u03bcL of each primer at a concentration of 10 pmol/\u03bcL, 1 \u03bcL of the Taq-Man probe at a concentration of 10 pmol/\u03bcL, 10 \u03bcL of master mix 5x, 0.2 \u03bcL of uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG), and 1.8 \u03bcL of distilled water in a final volume of 20 \u03bcL. At first UNG treatment at 50\u00b0C for 2 min and UNG inactivation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min was performed and then cDNA was amplified by 44 two-step cycles: denaturation (95\u00b0C, 15 s), primer annealing (55\u00b0C, 30 s). Viral cDNA copy numbers (expressed as copies per 1 \u03bcg of total RNA) were quantified by comparison with a 10-fold serially diluted plasmid standard of known concentration. The data and standard curves were obtained during target cDNA and recombinant plasmid amplification (unpublished data).",

The TNF-\u03b1 is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and is a member of a group of cytokines that stimulate the APR. The TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 are responsible for a broad spectrum of synergistic or antagonistic effects that influence the specific immune response of the stressed organism against foreign antigens and invading microorganisms (van Miert, 1995; Pinelli, 1996) . In the present experiment, the results of the IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 assay showed that the serum concentrations of these inflammatory cytokines in the infected group were significantly higher than in the control group after virus inoculation (P < 0.05; Figure 2) . Inflammatory reaction in infected chicks following IBV inoculation causes the release and elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations. These pro-inflammatory cytokines then induce the synthesis of APP by the liver. Therefore, the elevation in the IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, SAA, and Hp concentration in the present experiment could be explained. Arnold and Holt (1996) reported that the level of the tumor necrosis factor in the intestinal tract of infected birds with Salmonella enteritis was higher than healthy ones. Nang et al. (2011) determined infection of chickens with H9N2 influenza virus may induce the production of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 in trachea, lung, and intestinal cells. Liu et al.
