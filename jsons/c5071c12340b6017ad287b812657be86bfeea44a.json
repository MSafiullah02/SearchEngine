By the end of April, 2020, over 3 million people had been confirmed infected, with over 1 million in the USA alone, and over 215 000 deaths. The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are diverse, ranging from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. The major risk factors for severe COVID-19 are shared with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), namely increasing age, male sex, and comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes. However, the role of antifibrotic therapy in patients with IPF who contract SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the scientific rationale for their continuation or cessation, is poorly defined. Furthermore, several licensed and potential antifibrotic compounds have been assessed in models of acute lung injury and viral pneumonia. Data from previous coronavirus infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, as well as emerging data from the COVID-19 pandemic, suggest there could be substantial fibrotic consequences following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antifibrotic therapies that are available or in development could have value in preventing severe COVID-19 in patients with IPF, have the potential to treat severe COVID-19 in patients without IPF, and might have a role in preventing fibrosis after SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

In this group, the median age was 52 years, 100 (57\u00b78%) were male, 41 (23\u00b77%) had a history of hypertension, 28 (16\u00b72%) had diabetes mellitus, and ten (5\u00b78%) had coronary artery disease. Of 67 patients who were admitted to intensive care, required mechanical ventilation, or died, the median age was 63 years, 45 (67%) were male, and 39 (58%) had a comorbidity, of which the most common was hyper tension affecting 24 (36%) individuals. This description of the group in whom SARS-CoV-2 infection is most lethal is also highly representative of patients suffering with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF character istically affects men in their seventh or eighth decade of life, 5 commonly with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and ischaemic heart disease, and with a history of cigarette smoke exposure. 6 IPF is a progressive disease in which lung function inexorably declines, leading to respiratory failure and eventually death with lung transplantation being the only treatment that improves outcomes. 7 The incidence of IPF is rising and the disease is estimated to affect 3 million people worldwide. 8, 9 A large proportion of patients with IPF are treated with one of the two available antifibrotic drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, that have been shown Key messages \u2022 COVID-19 leads to a wide spectrum of respiratory diseases with an extremely high incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome. \u2022 The risk factors for severe COVID-19 are shared with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), suggesting that this group of patients will be at increased risk of severe COVID-19. \u2022 The burden of fibrotic lung disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely to be high; therefore, given the scale of the pandemic, the global burden of fibrotic lung disease will probably increase considerably. \u2022 There is therapeutic rationale for the use of licensed antifibrotic therapy in acute exacerbations of IPF, including those triggered by viral infection. \u2022 Available antifibrotic therapies have broad antifibrotic activity regardless of aetiology, and these drugs might have a role in attenuating profibrotic pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infection. \u2022 Novel antifibrotic strategies have a range of antiviral and epithelial protective effects in models of acute and viralinduced lung injury. \u2022 Previous coronavirus outbreaks have been associated with substantial postviral fibrosis and physiological impairment. Close follow-up of patients after COVID-19 is essential. \u2022 There is an urgent need for therapies that mitigate severe COVID-19 and clinical trials of antifibrotic molecules should be considered.",

Wootton and colleagues 18 found that a small proportion of patients with acute exacerbation of IPF had evidence of viral infection, including coronavirus infection (human coronavirus OC43). Acute exacerbations of IPF are also more common in the northern hemisphere's winter and spring months, 19, 20 supporting the theory that they might be mediated by respiratory tract infections. Pirfenidone is a pyridone with a poorly understood mechanism of action and nintedanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Although both drugs have pleiotropic effects, neither is immuno suppressive per se, and so there is no rationale for their discontinuation in the face of viral or bacterial infection. Of relevance, data from the INPULSIS II study 11 showed that treatment with nintedanib reduced the time to first acute exacerbation. Although this result was not replicated in the INPULSIS I study, 11 there remains the suggestion that nintedanib could reduce the incidence of acute exacerbation of IPF. Future studies analysing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of acute exacerbation of IPF will be informative in establishing the postulated link with viral infection.",

An inhaled formulation of pirfenidone is under evaluation in patients with COVID-19 (NCT04282902). Further, pirfenidone should be avoided if patients have an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 mL/min per 1\u00b773 m\u00b2. Although only 12 (1\u00b76%) of 752 patients in the cohort reported by Guan and colleagues 2 had a creatinine concentration of 133 \u03bcmol/L or higher, this proportion rose to six (4\u00b73%) of 138 patients with severe COVID-19, and data from Wuhan showed that of 52 patients admitted to the ICU, 15 (28\u00b78%) developed acute kidney injury and nine (17\u00b73%) required renal replacement. 3 These data imply that patients with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection are less likely to experience renal dysfunction, but with increasing severity of COVID-19 disease this renal dysfunction might become an important consideration when considering antifibrotic therapies. Both pirfenidone and nintedanib can be associated with hepatotoxicity, and liver dysfunction is common in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Elevated concen trations of liver enzymes were observed in 168 (22%) of 757 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 56 (39%) of 142 patients with severe disease. 2 Concomitant use of antibiotics for superimposed bacterial infection is likely to heighten the risk of liver dysfunction, and so in the context of a hospitalised patient who has IPF and severe COVID-19 with deranged liver function tests, temporarily withholding antifibrotic therapy pending resolution of liver dysfunction might be necessary, although this should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.",

In this context, the balance of risk and benefit is likely to tip in the direction of withholding antifibrotic therapy, particularly in the acutely unwell patient with low physiological reserve. Unfortunately, in a proportion of patients with IPF who contract SARS-CoV-2 infection, the patient and their medical team might consider escalation to intensive care to not be in their best interests, and that the focus should be on palliative care.

            "text": "The rationale for using antifibrotic therapy is based on the spectrum of pulmonary fibrotic disease observed in COVID-19, ranging from fibrosis associated with organising pneumonia to severe acute lung injury, in which there is evolution to widespread fibrotic change. 22 In fatal cases of COVID-19, pulmonary fibrosis is generally present at autopsy, 23 with anecdotal reports of severe fibrotic organising pneumonia. In some cases, abnormal immune mechanisms initiate and promote pulmonary fibrosis, possibly as a consequence of a cytokine storm. 23, 24 However, diffuse alveolar damage, which is the defining feature of ARDS, has been the characteristic histological feature in fatal COVID-19 cases 23, 25 with the added observation of microvascular thrombosis. 23 Although it might be unrealistic to separate these profibrotic pathways in individual patients, in whom there is a variable mixture of immunologically mediated damage and classical acute lung injury, antifibrotic therapy could provide value in inhibiting both broad pathways. However, this hypothesis must be advanced with important caveats, all of which need to be addressed if existing antifibrotic agents are to be applied in the current pandemic. These drugs do not address the immune dysregulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, nor can they be expected to attenuate the prothrombotic aspects of this complex pathogenic process. If antifibrotic therapy is to have a role, it is likely to take the form of inclusion in combination regimens, once effective anti-inflammatory treatments have been identified. Combination therapy could, in principle, address major anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic pathways while attenuating their fibrotic consequences.",

Antifibrotic therapies are exclusively used in chronic fibrotic disorders-mostly in IPF but also for progressive pulmonary fibrotic disease in disorders other than IPF. 26, 27 Outcomes have generally been evaluated at 1 year follow-up, with changes in forced vital capacity (FVC) being the uniform primary endpoint. However, it is striking that in pivotal trials of nintedanib, both in IPF (the INPULSIS trials) 11 and in other non-IPF disorders (the INBUILD trial), 26 early separations in FVC trends between treatment and placebo groups were shown, with significant differences at 4-6 weeks. No similar early trends exist in the pirfenidone data, but FVC separations were evident at 3 months in the ASCEND trial. 10 A decline in FVC occurs slowly in chronic fibrotic lung disease and, thus, the observed early separation of FVC trends seem to indicate that antifibrotic agents attenuate profibrotic pathways shortly after their introduction. However, it might be overly optimistic to expect these agents to add value in ventilated patients, in whom the opportunity for effective treatment has already passed. The use of antifibrotic therapy in COVID-19 might be contingent on the identification of biomarkers early in the disease course to identify patients with a poor prognosis who are likely to progress to pulmonary fibrosis and acute lung injury.",

However, it has become increasingly apparent that distinct patient subgroups in other interstitial lung diseases show relentless disease progression, similar to IPF, despite traditional treatments (eg, corticosteroids and mycophenolic acid) used to suppress immune dysregulation. These patient subsets, amalgamated as the progressive fibrotic phenotype, were not able to access antifibrotic drugs confined by regulators to patients with IPF. With this background, patients with progressive pulmonary fibrosis in a wide variety of interstitial lung disorders were combined in the placebo-controlled INBUILD trial of nintedanib, 26 an approach similar to that in basket oncological trials. In the landmark publication, active treatment was associated with a reduction in FVC decline of about 60%. Import antly, treatment effects were shown to be strikingly similar within each of the five core disease groups, one of which consisted of patients with connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease. 28 In this subgroup, pathogenetic profibrotic pathways driven by immune dysregulation might have similarities to those pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether or not this speculation is confirmed, the key conclusion from the INBUILD study was that nintedanib therapy appears to inhibit fibrogenesis across a wide range of pulmonary disorders. In a parallel study of pirfenidone therapy in unclassifiable interstitial lung disease and idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonia, 27 the choice of home spirometry as the primary endpoint might have led the study to not meet its prespecified criteria for success, but a key secondary endpoint-FVC trends measured in pulmonary function laboratories-was equivalent to the primary endpoint in the INBUILD trial, 26 and the pirfenidone treatment effects were similar to those of nintedanib. These trials potentially suggest that antifibrotic therapy, when used early in SARS-CoV-2 infection, might have major benefits in reducing fibrotic damage driven by immune dys regulation. However, to have a major impact on outcome, interventions must also address the serious issue of acute lung injury.",

However, in the pooled analysis, investigator-defined frequency of acute exacerbations were not significantly different between nintedanib and placebo. The widespread uncertainty about this finding relates to the small number of events: the difference was significant in only one of the two trials. Some credibility is added by the fact that significance increased when the pooled adjudicated analysis was confined to episodes judged by an expert panel to be genuine acute exacerbations, despite the reduction in numbers of events.

Clinical outcomes were compared between patients receiving and not receiving pirfenidone, although these evaluations were neither placebo controlled nor randomised. Treatment with pirfenidone was associated with significant reductions in both postoperative mortality 29 and acute exacerbations. 30, 31 In summary, we hypothesise that a clinical trial of antifibrotic therapy in COVID-19 before ventilation is warranted. Formal controlled evaluation is essential to assess unexpected adverse effects, even though existing antifibrotic agents have not, in general, exhibited lifethreatening toxicity. In advancing this argument, we stress that there is currently no basis for empirical offlicence treatment.

Indeed, a number of early antifibrotic studies focused on key antiviral proteins, such as IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3. 32, 33 Subsequent studies have found that exogenously administered as well as endogenously produced interferon might induce pul monary vasculopathy, [34] [35] [36] and this finding is important given that pulmonary vascular disease could play an important role in severe COVID-19 disease. Indeed, circulating IFN-\u03b3 and CXCL10 concentrations are raised in patients with severe COVID-19. 37 Furthermore, much of the data generated in preclinical studies for antifibrotic therapy include use of the bleomycin animal model of pulmonary fibrosis. There are numerous issues with this strategy for research into IPF therapies, not least because this model is of the fibrotic response following acute lung injury, rather than the de-novo progressive fibrosis. However, acute lung injury and ARDS are the major cause of mortality in COVID-19. Therefore, it is possible that antifibrotic therapies developed for chronic fibrotic lung diseases using bleomycin models might actually be beneficial in COVID-19, both in the acute phase of the illness and in preventing long-term complications. There are two important issues to consider when trying to determine whether a novel antifibrotic drug would be harmful or beneficial in the context of SAR-CoV-2-related illness (table) . First, what is the effect of antifibrotic molecules on viral internalisation and replication? And second, what is their effect on mitigating the cytokine storm that seems to be responsible for complications in severe COVID-19 such as ARDS?",

Mice that do not express the \u03b1v\u03b26 integrin or treated with an \u03b1v\u03b26 blocking antibody are protected from a number of viral infections, including influenza and sendai virus. 45, 46 Strategies to block the \u03b1v\u03b26 integrin have been protective in in-vivo models of acute lung injury. 47, 48 Reassuringly, given the role of TGF-\u03b2 in immunity and host defence, inhibiting epithelial integrins does not appear to increase the risk of viral infection in several animal models. [45] [46] [47] 68 Further more, IL-1, which has been identified as a key component of the cytokine storm in COVID-19 and other viruses, might mediate its affects through Arg-Gly-Asp binding integrins. 69 Similarly, there is a well described role for galectins in viral infections. Gal-3 is upregulated in lung epithelial cells after influenza A infection and promotes binding to Streptococcus pneumonia. 50 Following H5N1 influenza infection, Gal-3 knockout mice do not have lower viral loads than control mice but do have reduced pulmonary inflammation, 51 and are protected from bleomycin and TGF-\u03b2-induced lung injury and fibrosis. 52 Two recent network analyses of protein-protein interactions identified that mTOR might be an anti-SARS-CoV-2 target and that rapamycin could be repurposed for this indication (figure). 70, 71 mTOR is an emerging target in IPF, with genetic support for the mTOR pathway identified in a large-scale genome-wide association study 72 and studies with PI3K inhibitors showing promise in IPF. 73, 74 Moreover, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin is a well established treatment for lymphangioleiomyomatosis 75 and is commonly used in transplant medicine. In an experimental animal model of H1N1 influenza, rapamycin in combin ation with oseltamivir reduced viral replication and the NLRP3 inflammasome. 60 PRM-151 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) is an analogue of SAP (also known as PTX2), which is a member of the pentraxin family of proteins that includes CRP and PTX3, and has shown promising results in a phase 2 trial for IPF. 62 The pentraxins are major acute phase response proteins with key roles in inflammation and immunity. 63 SAP has been shown to bind influenza A virus and prevent viral internalisation 64 and to inhibit influenza infection both in vitro and in vivo (figure). [76] [77] [78] In addition, injection of recombinant SAP reduces inflammation 7 days following bleomycin-induced lung injury in mice. 79 The mechanism of action of SAP might be via suppression of JNK family signalling (figure), 80 which has also been therapeutically targeted in IPF (CC-90001; Celgene, Summit, NJ, USA). This selective JNK1 inhibitor has been shown to prevent fibrosis in some experimental animal models, 55, 59, 81 and also inhibits sepsis-induced lung injury. 56 H5N1 influenza infection leads to upregulation of cytokines such as TNF\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IL-6 via phosphorylation of JUN, and genetic targeting of JNK1 improved survival and reduced bronchoalveolar lavage cytokines in mice. 57 Furthermore, JNK family inhibition impairs synthesis of H5N1 viral RNA, 58 and SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to stimulate pro-inflammatory pathways via JNK signalling pathways. 82 In studies with dengue virus, which is also a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, in a viral animal model, a JNK inhibitor reduced viral liver injury and markers of severe disease, such as leucopenia and cellular apoptosis. 83 On March 30, 2020, Vicore Pharma submitted a clinical trial application for C21 (an agonist of AT2R) in IPF and this drug has been given approval for a phase 2 study in COVID-19 (EudraCT 2017-004923-63). The role of angiotensin in SARS-CoV-2 is well documented, if somewhat poorly understood understood. 84 Membrane bound ACE2 is the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2, but is shed into the serum by ADAM17 where it acts to catalyse the hydrolysis of Ang II to Ang 1-7. This cleavage prevents the harmful effects of Ang II, which the conventional AT1R inhibitors, the artans, exploit in the treatment of hypertension. The role of AT1R inhibitors in COVID-19 is controversial, with studies suggesting that these treatments might increase ACE2 concentrations. 85 ",

Potential antifibrotic therapies might have beneficial effects in the treatment of COVID-19 through a range of different mechanisms, such as preventing viral uptake and replication, inhibiting viral signalling, and through beneficial effects on the renin-angiotensin system (figure). Although there is clearly much work to be done before these drugs could be considered safe, let alone beneficial in the context of COVID-19, the medical community should be reassured that there is biological rationale to suggest that antifibrotic therapies might have potential as novel therapeutics for severe COVID-19.",

Canonical profibrotic path ways regulated by TGF-\u03b2 47 are important, and there is evidence that vascular dysfunction is a key component of the switch from ARDS to fibrosis, with VEGF 97 and cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 implicated. 88 It remains unclear why certain individuals are able to recover from such an insult, whereas in others there is a shift to unchecked cellular proliferation with the accumulation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts and the excessive deposition of collagen alongside other components of the extracellular matrix to result in progressive pulmonary fibrosis.",

Overall, 51 (47%) of 108 patients had impaired gas transfer and 27 (25%) had reduced total lung capacity. This was much worse in patients with severe disease. 98 Until mature data are available, it is important to draw on the experience of previous coronavirus outbreaks. Although the global outbreak of SARS in 2003, caused by SARS-CoV, 99 affected far fewer individuals than the current COVID-19 pandemic, there are clear parallels. In a study of 75 patients who were con secutively hospitalised and met criteria for SARS, as defined by fever with a temperature of 38\u00b0C or higher, cough or shortness of breath, and new pulmonary infiltrates, the frequency of ARDS was 20% by week 3 of admission. 100 Patients requiring admission to ICU with SARS had significantly more restricted lung function at 6 months after disease onset than those 6 months following ward-based treatment. 101 Across the entire cohort and regard less of whether ICU admission was required, impair ment of gas diffusion was observed in 17 (16%) and abnormal chest radiographs were present in 33 (30%) of SARS survivors. 101 In an early follow-up study of patients with SARS, 15 (62%) of 24 patients had CT evidence of pulmonary fibrosis at a mean follow-up duration of 37 days after hospital discharge. 39 Patients at higher risk of dev eloping post-SARS fibrosis were older and more likely to have required ICU care than patients without post-SARS fibrosis. In a follow-up study of 36 patients surviving Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection, 12 (33%) had radiographic evidence of pulmonary fibrosis; these patients were older and had longer ICU admissions. 102 Given approximately 30% of survivors of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome experienced persistent radiological and physiological abnormalities consistent with fibrotic lung disease, the repercussions of COVID-19 could include a large cohort of individuals with pulmonary fibrosis and persistent and potentially progressive physiological impairment. Long-term follow-up studies will be required to establish the true prevalence of post-COVID-19 fibrosis.",

Although IL-6 is generally considered to be a profibrotic molecule, 42,104,105 an experimental study with the bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis suggested that inhibiting Personal View IL-6 in the early phase of lung injury promotes fibrosis and that inhibition in the later stages of injury at the onset of the fibrotic phase might ameliorate fibrosis. 106 Nintedanib has been shown to attenuate bronchoalveolar lavage concentrations of IL-1\u03b2, 107 and pirfenidone reduces serum and lung IL-6 concentrations in murine models of pulmonary fibrosis, providing further biological rationale for the use of pirfenidone in COVID-19. 108 Given the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of people requiring invasive ventilation worldwide, post-COVID-19 fibrosis is likely to be a substantial problem. The effects of anti-interleukin therapy in the long term, although potentially beneficial, are completely unknown and could lead to worse fibrosis. Ultimately, the interstitial lung disease community should pull together to investigate the long-term consequences of COVID-19 and develop evidence-based strategies to deal with this emerging problem.",
