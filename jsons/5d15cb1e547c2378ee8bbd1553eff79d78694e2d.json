From the data collected in S\u00e3o Paulo State, we estimated the model parameters and calculated the basic reproduction number as R 0 = 6.828. Considering isolation as a control mechanism, we varied the releasing proportions of young and elder persons to assess their epidemiological impacts. The best scenarios were release of young persons, but maintaining elder persons isolated. To avoid the collapse of the health care system, the isolation must be at least 80%.",

This understanding, in turn, permits forecasting epidemiological scenarios when control mechanisms are introduced aiming to reduce or eliminate the infection. In the case of coronavirus disease 2019 , which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a strain of the RNA-based SARS-CoV-1, the possibility of obtaining scenarios is of fundamental importance. The reason is that in serious cases due to SARS-CoV-2 (new coronavirus) infection, immune cells overreact and attack the lung cell causing acute respiratory disease syndrome and possibly death. In general, the fatality rate in elder patients (60 years or more) is much higher than the average, and under 40 years seems to be around 0.2%. [10] .",

This virus can be transmitted by droplets that escape the lungs through coughing or sneezing and infect humans (direct transmission), or they are deposited in surfaces and infect humans when in contact with this contaminated surface (indirect transmission). The virus enters into susceptible persons through the nose, mouth, or eyes, and infects cells in the respiratory tract, being capable to release millions of new viruses. Like all RNA-based viruses, the new coronavirus tends to mutate faster than DNA-viruses, but lower than influenza viruses Currently, there is not a vaccine, neither efficient treatment, although many drugs (chloroquine, for instance) are under clinical trial. Hence, isolation is the main, if not unique, way of controlling the dissemination of this virus in a population aiming the change in the natural history of disease propagation (this change is commonly known as the flattening curve of epidemics). Nevertheless, this isolation arises an important question: are there reliable strategies to release these isolated persons aiming to avoid the retaken of its original progression of infection?",

When a control mechanism is introduced, this number is reduced and is called as the reduced reproduction number R r . Ferguson et al. [5] proposed a model to investigate the effects of isolation of susceptible persons. They analyzed two scenarios, called by them as mitigation and suppression, and predicted the numbers of severe cases and deaths due to CoViD-19 without control mechanism, and compared them with those numbers when control is introduced.",

The model aims to describe the onset and subsequent spread of the new coronavirus in S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil. The understanding of the dynamics means that the model parameters are fitted against data collected in S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil. These estimated parameters are then used to study the potential scenarios when an intervention is introduced as a control mechanism. S\u00e3o Paulo State adopted the isolation of persons as the controlling mechanism, which can not be isolated indefinitely.

Let us determine the initial conditions supplied to this system. In the S\u00e3o Paulo State, the number of inhabitants is N (0) = N 0 = 44.6\u00d710 6 according to SEADE [8] . The value of parameter \u03d5 given in Table 1 was calculated by the equation (A.4), \u03d5 = b\u03c6/ (1 \u2212 b), where b is the proportion of elder persons. Using b = 0.153 in the S\u00e3o Paulo State [8] , we obtained \u03d5 = 6.7 \u00d7 10 \u22126 days \u22121 , hence, N y (0) = N 0y = 37.8 \u00d7 10 6 (s 0 y = N 0y /N 0 = 0.8475) and N o (0) = N 0o = 6.8 \u00d7 10 6 (s 0 o = N 0o /N 0 = 0.1525).

We also use these ratios for elder persons, even p o and m o are slightly lower. Hence, if we assume that there is one person in D 2j (the first confirmed case), then there are 4 persons in Q 2j . The sum (5) is the number of persons in class D 1j , implying that there are 20 in class A j , hence, the sum (25) is the number of persons in class E j . Finally, we suppose that no one is isolated or tested, and immunized.

In estimation and epidemiological scenarios, we assume that all transmission rates in young persons are equal, as well as in elder persons, that is, we assume that \u03b2 y = \u03b2 1y = \u03b2 2y = \u03b2 1o = \u03b2 2o , and \u03b2 o = \u03c8\u03b2 y , hence, the forces of infection are \u03bb y = (A y + D 1y + A o + D 1o ) \u03b2 y /N and \u03bb o = \u03c8\u03bb y . The reason to include factor \u03c8 is the reduced capacity of defense mechanism by elder persons (physical barrier, innate and adaptive immune responses, etc.). The force of infection takes into account all virus released by infectious individuals (A y , D 1y , A o , and D 1o ), the rate of encounter with susceptible persons, and the capacity to infect them (see [12] [13] ). Additionally, the amount aspired by susceptible persons can be determinant in the chance of infection and in the prognostic of CoViD-19 [19] . From data collected in the S\u00e3o Paulo State from February 26 until April 5, 2020, we fit transmission (\u03b2 y and \u03b2 o ) and additional mortality rates (\u03b1 y and \u03b1 o ), and the proportions of isolated persons (k y and k o ) are estimated using data from March 24 until April 21. Once determined these parameters, we study potential scenarios introducing isolation as control mechanisms.",

From the fact that lethality among young persons is lower than elder persons, we let \u03b1 y = 0.2\u03b1 o [3] , and estimate only one variable \u03b1 o . The estimated rates are \u03b1 y = 0.0052 and \u03b1 o = 0.026 (days \u22121 ). For lower R 0 , fixing \u03b2 y = 0.45 and \u03b2 o = 0.5265 (days \u22121 ), we estimated \u03b1 y = 0.08 and \u03b1 o = 0.4 (days \u22121 ). This is called the first estimation method. The first estimation method used only one information: the risk of death is higher among elder than young persons (we used \u03b1 y = 0.2\u03b1 o ). However, the lethality among hospitalized elder persons is around 10% [3] . Combining both findings, we assume that the deaths for young and elder persons are, respectively, 2% and 10% of accumulated cases when \u2126 y and \u2126 o approach plateaus (see Figures 4(a) and 5(a) below). This is called the second estimation method, which takes into account a second information besides the one used in the first estimation method. In this procedure, the estimated rates are \u03b1 y = 0.0018 and \u03b1 o = 0.009 (days \u22121 ) for both R 0 .

Figure 9 shows the curves of D 2 without (k = 0) and with (k = 0.5) isolation initiated at t = 27, but released according to strategy 1. For release beginning at t = 56 for young (a) and elder (b) persons, the peaks are, respectively, 4.957 \u00d7 10 5 (99%) and 4.607 \u00d7 10 5 (92%), with peak occurring at t = 82; and for release at t = 72, 1.641 \u00d7 10 5 (99%) and 1.529 \u00d7 10 5 (92%), with peak occurring at t = 92. The release in comparison with only isolation, peaks are anticipated in 6 and delayed at 4 days, respectively, for young and elder persons.

The release in comparison with only isolation, peaks are anticipated at 1 and delayed in 10 days, respectively, for young and elder persons. Table 4 shows the values of \u2126, \u03a0, S, and I at t = 250, for strategies 1, 2, and 3 for release occurring at t = 72. Percentages are calculated with respect to k = 0. When young and elder persons are released simultaneously, the numbers of severe CoViD-19 and deaths maintain practically unchanged, as well as immune persons. However, the remaining susceptible persons increase, which indicates that the second wave harm more elder persons. There is very tiny difference among the three strategies. Table 4 presents what happens at the end of the first wave, showing that there is not a significant difference when release is done at t = 56 or 72, either for the three strategies. However, during epidemics, release later (t = 72) is better, as well as the third strategy. 20 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Nevertheless, when these isolated infectious individuals are released, they contribute to increase the velocity of propagation. The virus should be circulating among isolated persons through restricted contact occurring in the household and/or neighborhood. If symptomatic persons are transferred to hospital, then removed from isolation, it is expected that asymptomatic persons are predominantly spreading the new coronavirus. If we can assume that they are releasing a low amount of virus, it is expected that more asymptomatic cases will arise than severe CoViD-19. Increasing immune persons, they decrease susceptible persons, hence the effective reproduction number decreases, which is a herd immunity phenomenon.",

In the first plateau, the ratios are 18 : 1, 26 : 1, and 24 : 1 for, respectively, elder, young, and total persons. The second plateau (5 : 1) is reached when the first wave of epidemics is ending. Therefore, during epidemics, there are much more hidden than apparent persons, which makes any control mechanisms hard if mass testing could not be implemented. However, the estimation of the ratio between hidden and apparent cases can be helpful in designing mass testing to isolated asymptomatic persons. In this paper, epidemiological scenarios were obtained aiming the evaluation of isolation and subsequent release. However, from Figure 6 (a), we observed a lowering in severe CoViD-19 data with respect to the estimated curve. Hence, let us assume that at t = 45, 18 days after the beginning of isolation, protection actions were adopted by persons (use of alcohol gel and face mask) [6] . Figure 22 (a) shows three curves of D 2 = D 2y + D 2o and observed data, where \u03b2 y = 0.7\u03b2 y = 0.525, 0.5\u03b2 y = 0.375, 0.45\u03b2 y = 0.3375 and 0.4\u03b2 y = 0.3. The better estimated is \u03b2 y = 0.45\u03b2 y = 0.3375. Figure 22 (b) shows the curves of D 2 for 4 different decreasing values of transmission rates extended from t = 0 until 250. We stress the fact that this evidence must be confronted with more data. The question of using a face mask and constant hygiene (washing hands with alcohol and gel and protection of the mouth, nose and eyes) to avoid infection is left to future work.",

As a consequent, asymptomatic and mild cases of CoViD-19 can prevail as epidemics evolves.

For this reason, the effective reproduction number R ef [17] , which varies with time, can not be defined neither by R ef = R 0 (s y + s o ), nor R ef = R 0y s y + R 0o s o . The function f (\u03ba) is determined by calculating the coordinates of the nontrivial equilibrium point P * . For instance, for dengue transmission model, f (s * 1 , s * 2 ) = s * 1 \u00d7 s * 2 , where s * 1 and s * 2 are the fractions at equilibrium of, respectively, humans and mosquitoes [18] .
