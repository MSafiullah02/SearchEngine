Institutional policies also mandated a halt of basic and translational science research in laboratories for experiments considered \"nonessential.\" Virtual clinical electives within different medical specialties became available for students currently in their clerkship year to participate in the care of COVID-19 patients and remain clinically engaged. These were coupled with independent research electives for students already working on clinical research projects with faculty mentors.",

In response, many postclerkship, third-year medical students currently conducting wet-lab research have had to modify their projects or adapt entirely new ones that can be completed remotely. Additionally, the curricular changes created uncertainty for first-year students surrounding neurosurgical research opportunities for the summer between first and second years. These restrictions might act to halt the momentum that students might otherwise be able to build early on in their academic careers. Alternatively, an increasing number of students might feel pressured to undertake a research year to make up for the lost opportunities during these times. If such is the case, a potentially disrupting rise in the number of residency applications may follow in next year's residency application cycle.",

First, it is important for academic institutions and neurosurgical organizations to understand the impact that this pandemic is having on students in real-time to help make effective policy changes. Second, we encourage medical student neurosurgery interest groups to capitalize on increased availability of now-remote students to form collaborative research groups. Third, neurosurgical communities should utilize virtual platforms to offer educational and mentorship opportunities for medical students. Inclusion of neurosurgery-minded students in virtual department educational meetings would enhance student learning and ensure accessibility of the department to students. Lastly, many elements of preparedness programs 4 could be converted into virtual webinars. For example, webinars on neurosurgical residency application and subinternship preparation strategies by program directors could offer key insights to medical students of all years.",
