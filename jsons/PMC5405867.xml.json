Covalent linkage of ISG15 (ISGylation) is mediated by the consecutive action of the E1 activating enzyme Ube1L3, the E2 conjugating enzyme UbCH8 (refs. 4,5) and several E3 ligases, including mouse HERC6 and human HERC5 (refs. 6,7,8,9), which catalyze the conjugation of most substrates in mice and humans, respectively.

ISGylation occurs at the ribosome in a cotranslational manner, favoring the modification of viral proteins in infected cells13. ISGylated capsid proteins fail to assemble properly, thereby inhibiting the propagation of the virus13. However, multiple cellular proteins14,15, including the ubiquitin E2 enzymes Ubc13 (ref. 16) and UbcH6 (ref. 17) as well as the transcription factor IRF3 (refs. 18,19), are modified by ISG15. Moreover, free ISG15 is released from cells and acts in a cytokine-like manner on natural killer cells, thereby stimulating interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) production20. Concordantly, humans with inherited ISG15 deficiency show impaired IFN-\u03b3 responses and fail to effectively counteract mycobacterial infection21. Beyond the function of ISG15 in immunity, ISGylation is involved in DNA repair22 and tumorigenesis23,24.",

            "text": "Analogously to other post-translational control mechanisms, covalent linkage of Ub and Ubls to substrate proteins is a reversible process antagonized by deubiquitinating enzymes and Ubl proteases (DUBs). USPs make up the largest subclass of DUBs25. Most of the more than 50 known USPs cleave ubiquitin chains with different types of linkage, and some, such as USP2, USP14 and USP21, have been reported to recognize not only Ub but also ISG15 (refs. 26,27). In contrast to these cross-reactive isopeptidases, USP18 does not deconjugate ubiquitin from target substrates and is the only ISG15-specific protease identified to date28,29. However, some reports have indicated that, in a specific context, USP18 is associated with ubiquitin protease activity30,31. USP18 cleaves ISG15 from target proteins with high catalytic activity28 and constitutes the major ISG15 isopeptidase in vivo. Accordingly, knock-in mice selectively lacking USP18 enzymatic activity exhibit strongly enhanced and prolonged ISGylation32. Intriguingly, enhanced ISGylation in these mice mediates increased resistance against influenza and vaccinia virus infections and diminishes myocarditis after coxsackievirus B3 infection, thus indicating that USP18 protease inhibition is a potential antiviral strategy33,34. Irrespective of its enzymatic function, USP18 is a major negative regulator of type I IFN signaling through its interaction with the interferon receptor (IFNAR)35,36. Recent studies have shown that depletion of USP18 causes interferonopathies characterized by aberrant microglial activation35,37. Furthermore, ISG15 deficiency in humans correlates with destabilization of USP18, thereby enhancing the IFN response38.",

The sequence of the catalytic region of USP18 is closely related to that of ubiquitin-deconjugating USPs. In contrast to most other USPs, USP18 lacks additional typical interaction domains, thus prompting the question of how the unique specificity toward ISG15 is mediated on the molecular level. To gain insights into the mechanism of recognition and catalysis by USP18, we determined structures of mouse USP18 alone and in complex with mouse ISG15, by using X-ray crystallography. Analysis of these structures, biochemical investigations and characterization of several site-specific variants of USP18 provided insights into the molecular determinants of ISG15 recognition and cleavage.",

This result is in contrast to the structures of di-Ub in complex with USP21 (ref. 27) or with SARS coronavirus PLpro45, in which both domains of di-Ub show noticeable contacts with the protease. On the basis of the structure of USP21 in complex with di-Ub, USP18 has been suggested to bind ISG15 in a similar manner. To validate our structural observations, we tested the reactivity of USP18 toward the isolated C-terminal Ubl domain of ISG15 (ct-ISG15) compared with full-length ISG15 (both constructs were modified with a PA group as an active site probe). Both full-length ISG15-PA and ct-ISG15-PA readily reacted with the active site cysteine of USP18 and formed a covalent complex. In contrast, no binding of USP18 to the respective Ub probe44 was observed (Fig. 2b). Likewise, the kinetic analysis of USP18 reactivity toward a fluorescent ct-ISG15-FP substrate revealed highly efficient cleavage (Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 4a). Moreover, USP18 cleaved ct-ISG15 as effectively as it cleaved full-length ISG15 from cellular substrates (Fig. 2c). Thus, our results demonstrate that only the C-terminal Ubl domain of ISG15 is essential and sufficient for USP18 binding and activity.",

This result prompts questions how the exceptional specificity of USP18 is achieved and which particular residues are involved.

The side chains of His149 and Trp121 in ISG15 are in proximity, forming a \u03c0-\u03c0 contact that stabilizes the orientation of these residues and forms a hydrophobic bulb. In USP18, residues His251, Ala138 and Leu142 are part of a hydrophobic pocket that perfectly accommodates the hydrophobic bulb of ISG15 (Fig. 4c). This characteristic hydrophobic contact is further stabilized by the side chain of Pro128 of ISG15 and Leu142 of USP18 (Fig. 4c). The corresponding regions of USP7 largely differ from USP18. In particular, the residues in USP7 corresponding to IBB-1 are more bulky and polar. Ser192, His251 and Ala138 of USP18 are all substituted by glutamine residues in USP7. The hydrophobic Leu142 is replaced by an arginine. In particular, replacement of Ala138 in USP18 by a polar residue in other USPs might block the access of the bulky and hydrophobic Trp121 side chain of ISG15 (Fig. 4d). In contrast to IBB-1, IBB-2, located on blocking loop 1, mediates hydrogen-bond interactions with ISG15 (Fig. 4e). The corresponding blocking loop in USP7 is extended by two residues and adopts a conformation incompatible with ISG15 or ubiquitin binding. No hydrogen bonds are formed between USP7 and ubiquitin in this region (Fig. 4f).",

Likewise, we generated an ISG15 variant bearing an arginine residue instead of Trp121 (ISG15 W121R), as well as a variant in which Trp121, Pro128 and His149 of ISG15 were changed to the corresponding residues of ubiquitin (ISG15 W121R P128G H149V). The interaction of mouse USP18 with ISG15 and several variants was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR; binding curves and parameters in Supplementary Fig. 5). ISG15 bound to immobilized USP18 with a high affinity characterized by a fast association and dissociation phase. The Kd of 1.49 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcM (mean \u00b1 s.d.) is in good agreement with the Kd of 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM determined previously by microscale thermophoresis28. Changing the residues in IBB-1 to the corresponding residues of USP7 (variant USP18IBB-1-USP7), or making similar changes in IBB-2 (variant USP18IBB-2-USP7), resulted in a clear decrease in affinity toward ISG15. A more drastic decrease in affinity was observed for USP18IBB-1-USP7\u2013IBB-2-USP7, which contained both changes. To validate these results, we also analyzed variants of ISG15 with changes in the residues interacting with IBB-1 of USP18. The exchange of Trp121 in ISG15 to the corresponding arginine of Ub (variant ISG15 W121R) caused a clear decrease in affinity, and mutation of all three interacting residues, Trp121, Pro128 and His149 (variant ISG15 W121R P128G H149V), almost completely abolished the interaction with USP18. Likewise, the observed binding ratio of ISG15 per immobilized USP18 decreased to 0.4 when Trp121 was mutated, and no clear stoichiometry of binding could be obtained for the variant ISG15 W121R P128G H149V, thus indicating that the observed binding might be due to a residual unspecific interaction. The observations for the ISG15 variants corroborated the structural data showing that IBB-1 is an important determinant of the interaction between USP18 and ISG15.",

Wild-type (WT) USP18 reacted readily with ISG15-PA and ct-ISG15-PA within 1 min. In contrast, USP18IBB-1-USP7 formed no adduct, even after 5 min. The covalent adduct was observed only after prolonged incubation (Fig. 5a). USP18IBB-2-USP7 reacted almost as rapidly as WT, but completion of the reaction was impaired, as indicated by the presence of unreacted USP18. Strikingly, mutation of both IBBs in USP18IBB-1-USP7\u2013IBB-2-USP7 completely abolished covalent-complex formation (Fig. 5a). Notably, neither WT USP18 nor the USP18 variants reacted with Ub-PA, even after prolonged incubation (Supplementary Fig. 6a). As shown by multiple sequence alignments, IBB-1 and IBB-2 are well conserved among mammalians (Supplementary Fig. 7). To evaluate whether human USP18 recognizes the ISG15-like mouse USP18, we built a 3D model of the human USP18\u2013ISG15 complex on the basis of the structure of the mouse USP18\u2013ISG15 complex. As expected, the interaction surfaces are complementary, and the model suggests that IBB-1 of human USP18 is crucial for reactivity (data not shown). To evaluate these observations, we expressed and purified human USP18 and generated a human ISG15-PA probe. Because the interaction surfaces in the USP18\u2013ISG15 complex are well conserved between human and mouse proteins, we tested whether the ISG15-PA active site probes would label USP18 across species. As predicted by the model, human USP18 reacted readily with mouse ISG15-PA and vice versa (Supplementary Fig. 6b).",

As expected, WT USP18 added to cell lysates readily deconjugated ISG15 (Fig. 5c, lane 4). USP18IBB-1-USP7 showed no apparent cleavage (Fig. 5c, lane 6), whereas USP18IBB-2-USP7 still cleaved ISG15 conjugates (Fig. 5c, lane 8). In agreement with the results from all previous experiments, USP18IBB-1-USP7\u2013IBB-2-USP7 did not cleave endogenous substrates.

            "text": "Multiple sequence alignments of USP18 show that the hydrophobic character of IBB-1 is highly conserved among mammals and marsupialia (Supplementary Fig. 7). Likewise, the corresponding counterpart in ISG15, which carries the bulky tryptophan protruding from the surface, is also highly conserved (Supplementary Fig. 8). Thus, the hydrophobic interaction described here appears to be strictly conserved among different species. In particular, IBB-1 of USP18 and the hydrophobic patch of ISG15 are among the most conserved regions between these proteins. A similar degree of conservation was observed for only the catalytic cleft of USP18 and the C-terminal tail of ISG15 (Supplementary Figs. 7b and 8b). In contrast, instead of carrying the two hydrophobic residues Ala138 and Leu142 (Mus musculus numbering), fish USP18 carries an aspartate and a histidine residue at the corresponding positions (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Most interestingly, in fish ISG15, these variations are compensated by an exchange of the hydrophobic Trp121 and Pro128 (M. musculus numbering) to the polar residues arginine and glutamine, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 8a). A molecular model of a USP18\u2013ISG15 complex bearing these mutations suggests that the side chains of these polar residues can form several hydrogen bonds. This type of interaction is reminiscent of the interactions between other USPs and ubiquitin. Thus, we speculated that fish USP18 might not be restricted to ISG15 but may also be able to recognize ubiquitin. To test this hypothesis, we expressed USP18 from Danio rerio in HEK 293T cells and analyzed the cell lysates for reactivity with ISG15- and Ub-reactive probes (Fig. 6a). USP18 from D. rerio reacted readily with mouse ISG15-PA (Fig. 6b). Most interestingly, USP18 from D. rerio reacted with not only ISG15-PA but also mammalian Ub-PA, whereas mouse USP18 showed no cross-reactivity with Ub (Fig. 6c), as previously reported28. Although the portion of covalent modification of USP18 from D. rerio with Ub appeared to be less than that with ISG15, the modification was clearly visible and was not observed when the active site cysteine was mutated to alanine (Fig. 6c). These data further support that the IBB-1 region is critical for ISG15 specificity.",

            "text": "Most members of the USP family of DUBs cleave different types of ubiquitin chains from substrates. In addition, some USPs show cross-reactivity toward ISG15 (ref. 26). To ensure specific functions of the different USPs, most enzymes of the USP family have additional large domains mediating interaction with other protein complexes47 or specific organelles48, or they show temporal distributions49. In contrast, USP18 is a notably small member, which comprises only the USP core domain. Nevertheless, USP18 is specific for ISG15 and is not cross-reactive toward ubiquitin or any other member of the Ubl family28,29. Thus, the unique specificity must arise entirely from the USP core domain itself. Models based on structures of the isopeptidases USP21 (ref. 27) and the viral SARS CoV PLpro50, both of which cleave ISG15 and ubiquitin, suggest that USP18 might recognize both Ubl domains of ISG15. In the USP21\u2013di-Ub complex, the N-terminal Ub domain is in contact with the finger domain. In the SARS CoV PLpro, binding of the N-terminal Ubl domain to the thumb domain has been observed. However, no structure of a complex of full-length ISG15 with an ISG15 protease is currently available. Our analysis demonstrates that only the C-terminal Ubl domain of ISG15 is sufficient for USP18 binding and activity. Moreover, we identified the structural determinants essential for the extraordinary substrate specificity of USP18. We mapped two regions, IBB-1 and IBB-2, which are unique to USP18 and recognize regions that are present in the C-terminal Ubl domain of ISG15 but are absent in ubiquitin. Analysis of site-specific variants showed that IBB-1 is the major determinant of ISG15 cleavage, whereas IBB-2 has only minor contributions. This result is also reflected in the conservation of IBB-1 across different species. Whereas these residues are strictly conserved in IBB-1 in mammals, fish USP18 shows no conservation within IBB-1. Our results suggest that fish USP18 is a DUB cross-reactive with ubiquitin and ISG15. Furthermore, the IBB-1 region in fish USP18 has characteristics of ubiquitin-specific DUBs and lacks the two hydrophobic amino acids characteristic of IBB-1 of USP18.",

In contrast, a recent study has concluded that the mode of USP18-ISG15 interaction might differ between mouse and human proteins51. Our results further show that neither mouse nor human USP18 is able to catalyze deubiquitination in vitro, and we provide a molecular rationale for the remarkable specificity of USP18. However, two recent studies have provided evidence that USP18 is involved in deubiquitination of the TAK1\u2013TAB1 complex30 or NEMO31, thereby inhibiting activation of NF-\u03baB. These studies have suggested that USP18 influences the ubiquitination status of NEMO independently of its protease activity31, but, in contrast, USP18 inhibits ubiquitination of the TAK1\u2013TAB1 complex in a protease-dependent manner30,31. Our results clearly show that USP18 exhibits no reactivity toward ubiquitin in vitro, thereby indicating that the described inhibition of the NF-\u03baB pathway by USP18 is an indirect effect, rather than being mediated by direct interaction between USP18 and ubiquitin.",

The binding of primary signaling molecules to their cognate receptors in IFN signaling (JAK1 to IFNAR2 and Tyk2 to IFNAR1) has been suggested to be highly conserved52.

In unbound USP18, residues 131\u2013135 fold into a short \u03b1-helix that blocks the access of the C-terminal LRLRGG motif of ISG15 to the catalytic site of USP18. In ISG15-bound USP18, the \u03b1-helix unwinds, and the entire loop comprising these residues is displaced.",

The orientation of Ub bound to USP7 closely resembles the orientation of the ISG15 C-terminal domain in the USP18\u2013ISG15 complex. (c) Close-up view of IBB-1. The residues of USP18 forming IBB-1 are shown in green and form a hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the bulky aromatic side chain of Trp121 from ISG15 (orange). (d) Superposition of IBB-1 with the respective region of the USP7\u2013Ub complex. The labeling refers to residues in USP18 and ISG15. The interaction between USP18 and ISG15 is mediated by hydrophobic residues, whereas USP7 and ubiquitin display polar residues in this region. (e) Close-up view of IBB-2 (purple), showing several residues of a short antiparallel \u03b2-sheet of USP18 forming hydrogen bonds (dotted lines) with ISG15. For clarity, the side chains of the interacting residues are omitted. (f) Superposition of IBB-2 with the respective region of the USP7\u2013Ub complex. The distances between ubiquitin and USP7 are larger than those in the USP18\u2013ISG15 complex.",
