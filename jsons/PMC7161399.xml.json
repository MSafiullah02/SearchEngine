            "text": "The laws pertaining to authorization for autopsy vary among the states. Local jurisdictions may establish policies or procedures for compliance, and it behooves the practicing pathologist to know the relevant statutes in his or her region. In the United States, statutes pertaining to human remains stem from Old English common law.2 Thus, at death, possession or custody of the remains passes to a surviving spouse or legal next of kin. The legal custodian of the deceased has the duty to arrange proper disposition of the remains. Although this individual does not have ordinary property rights to the corpse, he or she may authorize an autopsy; donate tissues, organs, or the entire body for therapeutic or educational purposes; or, following appropriate legal statutes, have the remains cremated or embalmed and moved to a final resting place. The next of kin may place restrictions on the extent and manner in which an autopsy is performed. Any unauthorized dissection may be considered mutilation and is tortious or even criminal.3 Tissue and organ retention is regulated in the United States under state rather than federal law; other countries such as Australia and the United Kingdom have enacted specific legislation with respect to retention of organs, mostly in response to organ retention controversies starting with public outcry in 1999 regarding organ retention from autopsies performed at a Liverpool children's hospital.4 Changes in statutes regarding autopsy authorization are evolving in many jurisdictions to increase the autonomy of families to restrict either the extent of autopsy or retention of organs.5\n",

The death is indicated by the fact that\u2026the fetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life such as a beating of the heart\u2026or definitive movement of voluntary muscles\u201d effectively corresponding to an Apgar score of zero. Reporting of fetal deaths is required in almost all states for fetuses that are either 20 weeks or more of gestation or more than 350, 400, or 500 grams, depending on the state. Requirements for autopsy authorization usually correspond to the reporting requirements for fetal deaths. For example, in the state of California, stillborn fetuses of less than 20 weeks' gestation do not require authorization for autopsy but rather may be handled according to the rules covering organs and tissues removed surgically. However, the law does not establish a standard for determining whether a fetus has advanced to 20 weeks' gestation, and a parent may object to postmortem examination of a stillborn fetus of less than 20 weeks' gestation, so it may be prudent to require an autopsy consent for autopsies on all fetuses regardless of age. Stillbirths of 20 weeks' gestation and beyond require a fetal death certificate, and the usual laws related to disposition of the body pertain; it is our policy to send all autopsied fetuses to the medical facility's usual storage area for bodies, even if the body originated from an operating room or delivery suite.",

However, in a majority of these states, an individual's directives regarding autopsy or interment, or both, may be nullified by the objection of the legal next of kin after death.10 Before death, the decedent may indicate objection, and in some jurisdictions this is sufficient to prevent routine postmortem examination.11 Some statutes include provisions stating that consent from only one of several persons with custody of the remains is sufficient. In such cases, the wishes of the relative accepting responsibility for burial are often given preference.9 Because disposition of a dead body requires timely action, failure of an individual to assert these rights constitutes a waiver of the right.12 When a party waives these rights, he or she cannot also allege wrongful autopsy. However, some statutes clearly indicate that objection by another person with equal right of custody may preclude an autopsy. Thus it seems that a pathologist should seek local legal guidance, such as from the health care organization's risk management group, before proceeding with a postmortem examination in which he or she is aware of conflicts among equal next of kin.",

Why is this so? First, it is the decedent's clinician who has the closest rapport with family members and is best positioned to approach the next of kin with the sensitivity that the situation requires. Second, the clinician is probably present at the time of death; he or she notifies the family of the event and helps the family begin dealing with the legal responsibilities that accompany the death of a relative. Finally, except in situations in which the family actively requests a postmortem examination, the clinician is usually most persuasive because he or she is interested in the answers to unresolved clinical questions. Although all these reasons explain the situation of consent through proxy, the pathologist is potentially vulnerable to an improperly obtained informed consent. For these reasons, institutions may elect to require stricter criteria for autopsy consent than required by state law.",

Sometimes authorization for autopsy is obtained without appropriate notification of the legal authorities. In such situations, the pathologist assumes equal responsibility for properly notifying the medical examiner. This has particular legal consequence for the pathologist. A study by Start and colleagues19 indicated that clinicians have considerable difficulty recognizing the full range of cases that require notification of a medical examiner or coroner. Therefore, at any stage of an autopsy\u2014review of the medical history, prosection, or microscopic examination\u2014at which a pathologist recognizes issues or findings that indicate that the case should be reported, it is the pathologist's obligation to notify the medical examiner or coroner. This applies equally in cases previously released by the authorities if new discoveries might place the case within their purview. Finally, notification should be made immediately at the time of discovery, not after completion of the dissection or autopsy report. As a common courtesy, the responsible pathologist should inform the physician and family of the deceased of any changes in circumstances.",

In the United States, state laws stipulate which diseases physicians must report to public health agencies. Thus the pathologist has a legal obligation to report cases when certain infectious diseases come to light at autopsy. Diseases that are deemed notifiable vary slightly from state to state. However, state laws are influenced by input from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which makes annual recommendations for the list of nationally notifiable diseases (Box 2-3\n).20 Most state public health agencies voluntarily report nationally notifiable diseases to the CDC.Box 2-3Infectious Diseases Designated as Notifiable to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (as of 2015)\nAnthraxArboviral diseases, neuroinvasive and nonneuroinvasiveCalifornia serogroup virusesEastern equine encephalitis virusPowassan virusSt. Louis encephalitis virusWest Nile virusWestern equine encephalitis virus\nBabesiosisBotulismFoodborneInfantOther (wound and unspecified)\nBrucellosisChancroid\nChlamydia trachomatis infectionCholeraCoccidioidomycosisCryptosporidiosisCyclosporiasisDengue virus infectionsDengue feverDengue hemorrhagic feverDengue shock syndrome\nDiphtheriaEhrlichiosis/Anaplasmosis\nAnaplasma phagocytophilum\n\nEhrlichia chaffeensis\n\nEhrlichia ewingii\nUndetermined\nGiardiasisGonorrhea\nHaemophilus influenzae, invasive diseaseHansen disease (leprosy)Hantavirus pulmonary syndromeHemolytic uremic syndrome, postdiarrhealHepatitis, viralHepatitis A, acuteHepatitis B, acuteHepatitis B virus, perinatal infection hepatitis B, chronicHepatitis C, acuteHepatitis C, past or present\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection diagnosisInfluenza-associated pediatric mortalityLegionellosisListeriosisLyme diseaseMalariaMeaslesMeningococcal diseaseMumpsNovel influenza A virus infectionsPertussisPlaguePoliomyelitis, paralyticPoliovirus infection, nonparalyticPsittacosisQ feverAcuteChronic\nRabiesAnimalHuman\nRubellaRubella, congenital syndromeSalmonellosisSevere acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) diseaseShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC)ShigellosisSmallpoxSpotted fever rickettsiosisStreptococcal toxic-shock syndrome\nStreptococcus pneumoniae, invasive diseaseSyphilisSyphilis, congenitalTetanusToxic shock syndrome (other than streptococcal)TrichinellosisTuberculosisTularemiaTyphoid feverVancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) infectionVancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) infectionVaricella (morbidity)Varicella (mortality)VibriosisViral hemorrhagic feverCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virusEbola virusLassa virusLujo virusMarburg virusNew World arenaviruses (Guanarito, Junin, Machupo, and Sabia viruses)\nYellow fever\nFrom Centers for Disease Control and Prevention MMWR July 5, 2013, Vol. 60, No. 53: Summary of Notifiable Diseases, United States, 2011",

In general, two documents are of concern for the autopsy pathologist: the autopsy report and the death certificate. Autopsy reports prepared in the setting of a hospital practice are legally protected as part of the confidential medical record. However, in some states, autopsies reported by a medical examiner become part of the public record. Likewise, the public may gain access to causes of death listed on death certificates.23 For these reasons, the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs of the American Medical Association recommends that infection with human immunodeficiency virus or AIDS appear in the autopsy report only when it is relevant to the patient's cause of death.23 Others suggest that government offices adopt a two-part death certificate that includes one part for interment and immediate legal purposes and another for medical certification.24, 25 This would provide greater privacy to the family of the deceased.",

Goodman and colleagues review the current laws and provide guidelines for performing autopsies on Orthodox Jews.33 Discussion centers on two main issues: sanctity of the human body, which must remain inviolate even after death, and the prospect that a postmortem examination might save a life.34, 35 The Orthodox view stems primarily from the eighteenth-century attitude that the benefit of an autopsy must be readily apparent; that is, the knowledge obtained from an autopsy must help save another human life in immediate danger.36 Its benefit cannot be exclusively experimental or theoretical. In the modern world, in which communication in effect establishes a single great parish and the autopsy has a greater influence on the treatment of disease, others express the opinion that postmortem examinations may honor the dead through service to humanity.35, 37 Consistent with this more liberal attitude, a formal agreement between the Chief Rabbinate of the State of Israel and the Hadassah Hospital and Medical School in Jerusalem permitted autopsies in cases required by law, when in the opinion of three physicians the cause of death cannot otherwise be established; in cases involving hereditary diseases when necessary to guide medical care for a family; or when an autopsy may save the lives of others with a similar disease.38, 39 However, more recently enacted laws have had the effect of limiting the number of autopsies performed in Israeli hospitals.40\n",

In 1410, Pietro D'Argelata performed an autopsy on Pope Alexander V after his sudden death. In the late fifteenth century, Pope Sixtus IV issued a decree allowing the medical students at Bologna and Padua to study human remains.41 The acceptance of autopsies by the Church was well established when, in 1556, the autopsy of Ignatius Loyola revealed stones in the kidneys, bladder, and gallbladder.42\n",

To delay postmortem staining and lividity, the body should be removed to a refrigerated area as soon as reasonably possible. Before performing dissections that might interfere with embalming, the pathologist should alert the mortuary. For good cosmetic results, embalming of the head and neck is often critical and is easier if a reasonable length of common carotid artery is left intact (see Chapter 4).

Therefore, whenever possible and with consideration of the families' need for timely funeral arrangements, the pathologist should accommodate the schedules of the clinicians. If the clinician's obligations to other patients prevent his or her attendance at an autopsy, the pathologist should communicate the findings by conversation, as well as by the usual report.

The pathologist should be readily available to present autopsy findings at hospital conferences or at quality improvement meetings. In complicated cases, the pathologist also has an obligation to seek consultation from his or her pathology colleagues or, when necessary, from expert consultants.54 In contentious cases, the pathologist should take extra care with the wording of the autopsy report to avoid unnecessary provocation of the clinical teams or the families.
