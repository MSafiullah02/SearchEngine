            "text": "Viability is the ability of a supply chain (SC) to maintain itself and survive in a changing environment through a redesign of structures and replanning of performance with long-term impacts. In this paper, we theorize a new notion-the viable supply chain (VSC). In our approach, viability is considered as an underlying SC property spanning three perspectives, i.e., agility, resilience, and sustainability. The principal ideas of the VSC model are adaptable structural SC designs for supply-demand allocations and, most importantly, establishment and control of adaptive mechanisms for transitions between the structural designs. Further, we demonstrate how the VSC components can be categorized across organizational, informational, process-functional, technological, and financial structures. Moreover, our study offers a VSC framework within an SC ecosystem. We discuss the relations between resilience and viability. Through the lens and guidance of dynamic systems theory, we illustrate the VSC model at the technical level. The VSC model can be of value for decision-makers to design SCs that can react adaptively to both positive changes (i.e., the agility angle) and be able to absorb negative disturbances, recover and survive during short-term disruptions and longterm, global shocks with societal and economical transformations (i.e., the resilience and sustainability angles). The VSC model can help firms in guiding their decisions on recovery and re-building of their SCs after global, long-term crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We emphasize that resilience is the central perspective in the VSC guaranteeing viability of the SCs of the future. Emerging directions in VSC research are discussed.",

For other SCs, demand and supply have drastically dropped resulting in production stops (e.g., automotive industry), the danger of bankruptcies, and the necessity of governmental supports. Here the questions of SC survivability again arose. It is evident that both of these questions go beyond the existing state of the art in SC leagility, sustainability, and resilience because they cannot be resolved individually within each of these perspectives and require integrated frameworks and an extension when longterm, severe global disruptions affect all elements of SC ecosystems (i.e., businesses, society, nature, and economies).",

It considers system evolution through disruption-reaction balancing in the open system context. The viability analysis is survival-oriented at a long-term scale.\" Ivanov (2018b, p. 59 ) defines SC viability as an \"ability to survive and exist after a disruption [\u2026.] with the re-design of the supply chain structure and re-planning economic performance with long-term impacts.\" This SC ability to meet the demands of surviving in a changing environment follows the notions of the Viable System Model by Beer (1985) developed for intercompany perspective and ecology modeling angles (Aubin 1991) . Viability in this context can be understood considering approaches in ecological modeling. Ecological modeling is a research area concerned with the analysis of ecosystems in dynamics (Gross et al. 2004 (Gross et al. , 2009 .

Our contribution lies in conceptualization of a VSC model spanning three perspectives, i.e., agility, resilience, and sustainability. The principal ideas of the VSC model are adaptable structural SC designs for supply-demand allocations and, most importantly, establishment and control of adaptive mechanisms for transitions between the structural designs. Further, we demonstrate how the VSC components can be categorized across organizational, informational, process-functional, technological, and financial structures. Moreover, our study offers a VSC framework within an SC ecosystem. Through the lens and guidance of dynamic systems theory, we illustrate the VSC model at the technical level. The VSC model can be of value for decision-makers to design SCs that can react adaptively to both positive changes (i.e., the agility angle) and be able to absorb negative disturbances, recover and survive during short-term disruptions and long-term, global shocks with societal and economical transformations (i.e., the resilience and sustainability angles). The VSC model can help firms in guiding their decisions on recovery and re-building of their SCs after global, long-term crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We emphasize that resilience is the central perspective in the VSC guaranteeing viability of the SCs of the future. Emerging directions in VSC research are discussed.",

In Sect. 2, we elaborate on the viable SC ecosystem framework, discuss the relations between SC resilience and viability, describe the VSC model, and present the multi-structural view of the VSC model. In Sect. 3, we illustrate the SC viability formation through the lens of dynamic systems theory. Section 4 is created to map out some directions of a future research agenda in VSCs. We conclude the paper in Sect. 5 by summarizing the most important insights.",

Beer's Viable System Model (Beer 1985) allows us to understand how interconnected operations communicate with changing market environments and meta-systems such as markets, policy, and society. Through the lens of viability, the Beer's model builds upon an analogy with the human organism as the most advanced, survivaloriented complex system. According to Ashby's law of requisite variety (Ashby 1956 ), the situational variety should be balanced by the response variety of the controller or \"only variety absorbs variety.\" This law can be considered as one of the VSC pillars in the development of highly diversified and decentralized systems able to respond to increasing variety in the external systems such as new market models (e.g., omnichannel), new business models (e.g., circular economy), positive disruptions (e.g., innovations), and negative disruptions (e.g., natural catastrophes), to build resilient and sustainable operational systems. Moreover, VSC poses open system context analysis. An open system (Mesarovic and Takahara 1975; Casti et al. 1979 ) is a system that has interactions with the environment and evolves based on these interactions. The major characteristics of open systems are control, self-adaptation, and self-organization (von Bertallanfy 1969), which can be seen as future-leading management principles for VSC.",

Here we follow the research stream on structural SC adaptations (Allesina et al. 2010; Pavlov et al. 2019a ). The VSC structural view can be exemplified as follows. Consider a car manufacturer with a global SC. This SC can have one structural design at the times of economic stability and growth with full utilization of global sourcing, lean and agility advantages, offering a broad variety of products to satisfy individual customer needs . The second structural design relates to the disruptions and maintaining the resilience in case of singular, local events such as natural disasters, strikes, fires, etc. This kind of design, i.e., the resilient SC builds around proactive and reactive capabilities such as risk mitigation inventory, capacity flexibilities, and backup suppliers (Hosseini et al. 2019) . Finally, in cases of long-term, global disruptions such as COVID-19 pandemic, the third SC design is adapted which might be characterized by production changeovers (e.g., production of ventilators or masks instead of cars), reducing the product variety, radical changes in supplier base and logistics, and production localization (Simchi-Levi 2020).",

A strong immune system and acting in line with nature and society help human beings achieving high performances. Similarly, the SC performance depends on the resilience and sustainability. A weak immune system may result in performance degradation. Low SC resilience, if a disruption is experienced, also results in profitability reductions, mismatches of demand and supply, and destabilization of normal operations. Continuing the analogy, immune systems of each human being are in a continuous interaction with the environment. This property is reflected by viability in terms of utilizing positive feedbacks with the environment (e.g., making profits in growing markets), sustaining against negative impacts (e.g., facility disruptions) and surviving in a case of substantial changes in the environments, e.g., global pandemics. Put simply: strong immune systems help the living organisms to live and survive; strong resilience helps SCs to perform over the whole lifecycle and under different positive and negative conditions, i.e. to be viable.",

            "text": "Multi-structural VSC view    (2019), andZhong et al. (2017) elaborate on interrelations between lean, agile, and digital for increasingly data-driven market responsiveness. Efficient and resilient SCs (so-called LCN, low-certainty-need SCs) with the advantages of both lean and risk-resistant/recoverable SCs have been studied byIvanov and Dolgui (2019). The studies byAmindoust (2018), Ivanov (2018a,Fahimnia et al. (2018), Fiksel (2003, andRamezankhani et al. (2018) develop an integrated resilience-sustainability perspective.Papadopoulos et al. (2017) andManupati et al. (2020) present the insights on the mutual relations between digital technologies and sustainability. The interface of digital and resilient SC has been studied by Cavalcantea et al.(2019); Choi et al. (2017); Choi and Lambert (2017); Dubey et al. (2019b); Ivanov (2017b); Ivanov et al. (2019a), and Ivanov and Dolgui (2020b). Altay et al. (2018); Dubey et al. (2019b), and Ivanov et al. (2018a) organized a debate around the intersections of flexibility, agility and uncertainty and developed the discussion towards the roles of agility and flexibility in achieving SC resilience. Fahimnia et al. (2014) andDubey et al. (2015) pointed to empirically revealed intersections of the leagility and sustainability.Galaitsi et al. (2020) present empirical insights on the relations between system performance concepts such as adaptability, agility, reliability, resilience, resistance, robustness, safety, security, and sustainability.The VSC model extends the existing state-of-the-art SC resilience knowledge and builds upon the resilient mechanisms that have been extensively discussed and classified in the studies byBier et al. (2020),Ho et al. (2015),Hosseini et al. (2019a),,Melnyk et al. (2014),Pettit et al. (2019),Snyder et al. (2016), andTukamuhabwa et al. (2015), to name a few. In addition, literature on the SC ripple effect allows deducing the SC viability antecedents and drivers(Ivanov et al. 2014a, b;Garvey et al. 2015;Dolgui et al. 2018;Levner and Ptuskin 2018;Scheibe and Blackhurst 2018;Hosseini and Ivanov 2019;Ivanov et al. 2019a;Kinra et al. 2020;Li et al. 2019;Mishra et al. 2019;Sinha et al. 2020;Dixit et al. 2020;Dolgui et al. 2020b;Garvey and Carnovale 2020;Goldbeck et al. 2020;Li and Zobel 2020;\u00d6z\u00e7elik et al. 2020). Most of the SC resilience studies build their arguments around capacity and inventory reservations as well as back-up suppliers to cope with SC disruptions(Behzadi et al. 2018;Chen et al. 2011;L\u00fccker et al. 2017L\u00fccker et al. , 2019Hosseini et al. 2019b;Ivanov and Rozhkov 2017;Paul et al. 2019;Paul and Rahman 2018;Sawik 2016Sawik , 2019Schmitt et al. 2017;Song et al. 2018;Spiegler et al. 2016Spiegler et al. , 2017Yin and Wang 2018;",
