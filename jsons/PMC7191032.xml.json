The porcine intestinal epithelial cell lines SD-PJEC (Sun et al., 2012) and IPEC-J2 (Jung et al., 2018) are most commonly used for in vitro studies and characterization of the interaction between intestinal cells and enteroviruses. However, these cell lines consist of only a single type of cells, lacking the complexity and physiology of multiple cells in the native intestinal tracts. These cell lines are prone to spontaneous mutation upon repeated passages, reducing their applicability (Yin et al., 2019). The eventual outcomes of viral infection are generally complicated and associated with multifaceted host responses to different viruses. Hence, more representative models comprising multiple cells mimicking the intestinal tracts are required for in vitro studies.",

            "text": "In 2013, researchers successfully isolated the porcine enteroids for the first time (Gonzalez et al., 2013). Enteroids display more advantages when compared with the transformed or immortalized cell lines. The enteroids contain multiple distinct intestinal cell types, such as entero-endocrine cells, enterocytes, goblet cells, and stem/progenitor cells, and mimic the villus and crypt domains comparable to the architectures of the intestine in vivo (Gonzalez et al., 2013; Sato and Clevers, 2013; Powell and Behnke, 2017). Moreover, they could be passaged and banked for future use like the cell lines (Powell and Behnke, 2017). A recent study indicates that an in vitro 2D gut model could be established to expose the luminal side of the intestine to microorganisms, chemicals, and biologically active and toxic compounds, making it feasible to study innate immunity to pathogen infection and disease-associated polymorphisms (van der Hee et al., 2018). Porcine enteroids are also reported to be more amenable for lentiviruses transduction (Khalil et al., 2016) and plasmid transfection. This provides a robust tool to study intestinal diseases. Using intestinal enteroids as a model system, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was found to infect multiple lineages of porcine intestinal epithelial cells, providing insights into enteric virus-targeted intestinal cell populations (Li et al., 2018). Although porcine intestinal enteroids display a great potential as an in vitro host-virus interaction model, limited information is available on the possibility of its continuous uses in in vitro cultures, susceptibility to infection with porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and the types of immune responses induced by viral infections.",

However, its etiological role was not identified until 2014 when it was found to cause diarrhea in pigs in the United States (Woo et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014). To date, PDCoV has been reported in countries like the United States, Canada, South Korea, China, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam (Homwong et al., 2016; Janetanakit et al., 2016; Jang et al., 2017; Saeng-chuto et al., 2017; Ajayi et al., 2018; Le et al., 2018).

We isolated crypts from the duodenum of 3-week-old piglets first and then from jejunum and ileum (n \u2265 3). We found it easier to harvest crypts from duodenum than from jejunum or ileum. All cultured crypts from three intestinal segments could gradually differentiate into budding spherical enteroids from small round cell clusters (Figure 2A). The growth rate of the enteroids from the duodenum (n = 4) was significantly higher than those from the jejunum and ileum (p < 0.001) (Figures 2B,C). The colony-forming efficiency (CFE) of the enteroids derived from duodenum was also significantly higher than those from jejunum and ileum (p < 0.001) (Figure 2D). The enteroids were reported to be continuously passaged in vitro (Sato et al., 2011; Shaffiey et al., 2016). In our experiments, the jejunal enteroids were passaged more than 14 times (P14) and there were no morphological changes even after 14 passages, as compared with earlier generations (Figure 2E). The growth rate of the P14 enteroids did not decrease as compared with that of the passage 1 (P1) enteroids (Figure 2F). The jejunal enteroids frozen in liquid nitrogen for 1 month were still culturable and could grow to multicellular spheroids again (Figure 2G). In summary, the three-dimensional (3-D) porcine enteroids could be generated using the crypts from duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.",

We designed our experimental scheme to culture the 2-D porcine enteroid epithelial cell monolayers (Figure 3A) and identified the cell repertoires. We seeded the trypsin-treated round cell cluster in 96-well plates coated with 0.25% matrigel. The cells formed small round cell clusters, and then grew into a tight epithelial layer within 3 days (Figure 3B). IFA and PAS staining were used to examine the abundance of different cell subpopulations at the third passage post-differentiation (Figure 3C). Immunofluorescence of Sox9 and Ki67, recognized as the marker of stem/progenitor cells and TA proliferating cells, respectively, was shown over the 2-D enteroid monolayers. The presence of enterocytes was confirmed by immunostaining the apical brush border protein Villin1. Goblet (PAS+) and enteroendocrine cells (ChgA+) could be found in the MPIEs, but at low levels.

Another study showed that CD44 marker could be applied for sorting intestinal epithelial stem cells by FACS (Chang et al., 2016). Thus, we used CD326 (Epcam) to detect epithelial cells and CD44 to detect intestinal epithelial stem cells. The flow cytometric data revealed that the frequency of intestinal stem cells (CD326+ and CD44+) decreased from 85.8 to 55.1% after MPIEs differentiation from Day 0 to Day 3 (Figure 4A). The relative expression level of the stem cell marker gene Lgr5 decreased over 10-folds from Day 1 to Day 3, while the transcriptional levels of marker molecules of epithelial cells, such as entero-endocrine cell (ChgA), goblet cells (TFF3), enterocytes (L-Fabp), and Paneth cells (Lyz) were upregulated to different degrees (Figure 4B). No distinct changes were seen in the transcription of the + 4 stem cell marker gene, Bmi1, and proliferation antigen Ki67-related gene (Figure 4B).

In passage 4 cells inoculated with PDCoV, viral RNA copies at 48 h increased 76.4-folds compared with that of 2 h (Figure 5C). PDCoV could replicate similarly in different MPIE passages (P4, P9, and P12) (Figure 5C). There was apparent co-localization of the PDCoV N protein with Sox9 or Villin1 by using double-immunofluorescence labeling but not with Ki67, ChgA, or Lyz (Figure 5E). These results indicate that PDCoV could have tropism for stem/progenitor cells and enterocytes in porcine enteroids.",

The culture method we established is relatively easy without the necessity of cell-sorting steps. The quantity and purity of the separated crypts are high. In our culture method, the cultured PIEs are of almost 100% viability. A previous study has shown that the crypts from duodenum are relatively deeper compared with those from jejunum and ileum (Chwen et al., 2013). This suggests that duodenum might have better renewal frequency and potential than other intestinal segments. Duodenum was reported as having the best in vitro culture efficiency (but without presentation of experimental data) (Zietek et al., 2015). Our results support the conclusion that duodenum is superior to other segments probably as a result of expression of some specific genes in duodenum. A previous study has found different expression levels of the same genes located in different cells, although all cells are exposed to the same cytokines (Tsai et al., 2018). In another study, transcription of genes specific in some intestinal segments was not affected by cell passaging, and this special expression patterns could maintain for 10 to 12 weeks. However, most reported DEGs (differentially expressed genes) are related to nutrition absorption and transportation, such as GLP-1 and GIP (Middendorp et al., 2014). Evidence for the DEGs related to renewal is still lacking.",

            "text": "The study of 3-D enteroids provides new inspiration for intestinal biology, but the relatively closed three-dimensional structure is an important practical limitation for biomedical research. For example, it is hard to perform quantitative analysis and viral infection, and it can also cause severe damage of enteroids proceeded micro-injection (Bartfeld and Clevers, 2015). Thorne et al. (2018) have established a simple 2-D enteroid monolayer culture system, which can recapitulate many properties of the intestinal epithelium and 3-D organoids. The MPIEs we cultured could form a tight confluent monolayer in 3 days and allow the virus to easily enter from the apical surface of the mucosa. This is also important for studying cell signaling and cellular responses, as many receptors are differentially expressed in the apical and baso-lateral membranes, including transporters, Toll-like receptors, and cytokine receptors (Playford et al., 1996; Kesisoglou et al., 2010; Grenier et al., 2013; Cevallos Porta et al., 2016). In addition, monolayer PIEs contain a repertoire of differentiated cell types and some progenitor cells. Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) can infect enterocytes (Ettayebi et al., 2016), rotaviruses can infect enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells (Saxena et al., 2016), and echovirus 11 preferentially infects enteroendocrine cells (Drummond et al., 2017). Our results indicate that PDCoV can replicate in the Sox9 + cells and Villin1-positive enterocytes. PDCoV has been found to locate mainly in the villi in the early stage of infection, but a small number could be present in crypts and Peyer\u2019s patch during the late stage of infection (Hu et al., 2016). The spike (S) protein of coronaviruses functions as the key element for invasion into the cells by interaction with the receptor (Millet and Whittaker, 2015) and its activation is dependent on host cell proteases. This indicates that the stem cells and the absorptive enterocytes might possess the same or similar proteases. In short, MPIEs can be used as a system through which the enterovirus-gastrointestinal interactions can be simulated to reproduce the details of events associated with viral infections in vivo.",

Our results show that the number of stem cells in the 2-D enteroids decreased after differentiation and transcription of Lgr5 was not detectable (Figure 5D). However, PDCoV infection induced significant upregulation of Bmi1 transcription, possibly due to the functions of intestinal stem cells (ISCs). So far, two ISC groups have been confirmed in the intestinal crypts, activated intestinal stem cells (aISCs) and reserved intestinal stem cells (rISCs). The gene markers of the aISCs include Lgr5, Ascl2, and Sox9. The rISCs are located in the \u201c+4 to +6\u201d position at the bottom of the crypts with BMI1 as the main marker. A previous study has shown that the number of the aISCs decreased significantly in the crypts exposed to radiation followed by the activation of rISCs for ISCs\u2019 regeneration (Kim et al., 2017). Similarly, rISCs might be activated for intestine repair after PDCoV infection. Ki67, which is related to the cell proliferation and injury repair, was upregulated in the early stage of the intestinal injury in the ischemia\u2013reperfusion (I/R) model (Abdeen et al., 2011). Thus, injury of the ISCs might be the reason why Ki67 was upregulated in the early stage of PDCoV infection in our study.",

A previous study reported that the Bmi1-expressing stem cells are activated to replenish the Lgr5-expressing cells under pathological conditions (Tian et al., 2011). This could explain why the stem cell marker gene Lgr5 was not detectable by RT-qPCR at 24 hpi (Figure 5D). Therefore, up-regulation of Bmi1 indicates differentiation of large amount of +4 stem cells in response to PDCoV infection. Up-regulation of the genes related to markers of the secretory cells, such as ChgA, Lyz, and TFF3, may be due to a protective mechanism of the host cells by secreting mucus, antibacterial peptides, and other substances (Gill et al., 2011). We also found that the PDCoV infection can induce a much stronger immune response of enteroids than that of IPEC-J2 cells, which may be due to the presence of more stem cells in MPIEs (Andersson-Rolf et al., 2017).",

This 2-D enteroids model should be superior to commonly used IPEC-J2 cells for investigation of immune responses of intestinal cells to infection by porcine enteric pathogens, such as PDCoV. We anticipate that enteroid infection models will play an important role in the study of enteroviruses replication and pathogenesis.",
