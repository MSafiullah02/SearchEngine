The composite exhibited regularly spherical particles with the size of 50 nm and the specific surface area of 90.3 m 2 g \u22121 , furthermore, it showed mesoporous structure and significantly improved dispersion. SA was grafted on TiO 2 surface by -COOTi and TiO 2 existed as pure anatase phase in the composite. The addition of SA made the band gap of TiO 2 increased from 3.03 to 3.35 eV, which indicting that the composite exhibited a strong response to the ultraviolet light. The optimum preparation parameters of the catalyst were as follows: n(Ti):n(SA) = 1:0.05, ethanol 60 mL, glacial acetic acid 40 mL, hydrothermal temperature 180 \u00b0C, hydrothermal time 12 h. The composite could reach the 4.31 log reduction of E. coli, with the optimum catalyst dosage of 0.7 g L \u22121 , irradiated by UV light for 60 min. SA/TiO 2 was an environmentally friendly, non-toxic and safe sterilized nanocomposite material appropriate for future bactericidal applications, providing a new way to effectively increase the dispersion of TiO 2 particles to achieve superior photocatalytic sterilization efficiency.",

Further researches were conducted to explore its photocatalytic sterilization activity and mechanism, and TiO 2 was verified that it could transfer toxic and non-biodegradable organic pollutants into small molecules such as water and carbon dioxide by photocatalytic oxidation [4] . It was notable that many researches manifested TiO 2 also had superior sterilization performance against many bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus niger, Bacillus atrophaeus, Giardia lamblia and etc. [5] . For instance, the sterilization efficiency of TiO 2 for Staphylococcus aureus could reach 93% irradiated by UV light for 30 min [6] , while its was up to 97% for Giardia lamblia under UV light irradiation for an hour [7] , showing that TiO 2 possessed broad and efficiency sterilization activity, which was beneficial to apply in actual drinking water treatment to deal with different bacteria.",

            "text": "With so many superior advantages described above, TiO 2 was considered as an excellent potential material to deal with microbial contamination problems. However, there was a big obstacle in actual application which the surface area, free energy and binding energy of the TiO 2 catalyst substantially increasing when the crystal size decreasing, making the catalyst agglomerate and eventually leading to the unsatisfied photocatalytic effect [8] . Therefore, the dispersion of TiO 2 was expected to overcome. It was reported that the element doping [9] , noble metal loading [10] , semiconductor compounding [11] and surface modification by organic compounds were useful to tackle this problem [12] . Especially, the surface modification of TiO 2 enhancing its surface acidity, was a feasible way to improve its photocatalytic activity. The reason was that the concentration of Ti 3+ and the adsorption concentration of O 2\u2212 , O \u2212 on the TiO 2 surface would reduce, while the oxygen defect sites would increase after modified by acid [13] . As a result, it could effectively hinder the electron-hole recombination and improve TiO 2 photocatalytic activity. It was obvious that modification by strong acid greatly improved TiO 2 photocatalytic activity, for example, the photocatalytic activity of SO 4 2\u2212 /TiO 2 was 2-10 times higher than that of TiO 2 at the same reaction conditions [14] . Nevertheless, TiO 2 modified by strong acid was unsuitable to apply in drinking water treatment due to its high toxicity and researchers turned to try using weak acid to modify it. Compared with the pure TiO 2 , TiO 2 modified by surfactants oleic acid had higher photocatalytic activity and could degrade methylene blue efficiently even at low concentration [12] . Besides, the TiO 2 -stabilized Pickering emulsion, which was successfully modified by salicylic acid, provided a new way to the degradation of insoluble organic pollutants [15] . These results indicated that weak acid could also effectively modify TiO 2 to increase its photocatalytic activity. Hence, the surface modification by the lower nontoxic weak acid was probably a feasible way to increase the photocatalytic sterilization activity of TiO 2 , which was suitable to apply in water treatment.",

Firstly, 4.5 mL saline solution was added into 0.5 mL bacteria suspensions, and then the 10 times diluted bacterial suspension was acquired under stirring. After that, taking 0.5 mL forming mixture in a beaker and 4.5 mL saline solution was added into the beaker to form new mixture by stirring.

It was found that the flake TiO 2 obviously agglomerated with large particle size, while the composite presented spheroidal with smaller size and larger dispersion. The SEM images confirmed that the addition of SA would reduce the composite size and increase its dispersion. Moreover, shown in the images of (c, d) and (e, f), the composite became lager when the molar ratio of TiO 2 to SA was 1:0.05, however, when the molar ratio reached to 1:0.1, the composite size became too large. It showed that adding SA properly was effective to hinder TiO 2 particles agglomeration, but excessive SA would coat on the TiO 2 surface making the composite size become larger [21] . FT-IR spectra of TiO 2 , SA and SA/TiO 2 samples were shown in Fig. 3 . The strong absorption peaks of TiO 2 were obtained at 3430, 1634 and 1430 cm \u22121 in Fig. 3a , the first two absorption peaks resulted from the -OH stretching and bending modes for the absorbed water on TiO 2 surface, while the last peak was ascribed to Ti-OH after TiO 2 contacted with water. SA showed strong absorption bands at 1710, 1640, 1612 and 1414 cm \u22121 in Fig. 3b , the first two were attributed to the stretching vibration of C=C and C=O, while the others were corresponded to the asymmetric vibration peak and symmetrical vibration peak of COO-, respectively. Other absorption bands of SA was obtained at 3026 and 2970 cm \u22121 assigned to =C-H and -CH 3 . For SA/TiO 2 , the new peaks at 1560, 1401 and 1120 cm \u22121 appeared in Fig. 3c , the first two were correspond to the peak shift of the -COOTi stretching vibration absorption, implying that SA was successfully grafted on TiO 2 surface, and the emergence of new peak at 1120 cm \u22121 was due to the more unbalanced force between the C atom and the two O atoms in SA after the carboxyl combination with Ti atom, resulting in the double bond of C=O broken and forming C-O bonds. Besides, the absorption band of the composite at 1634 cm \u22121 was sharp assigned to the C=C bonds from two different sources, including the original C=C bonds in SA itself and the broken of C=O bond to form new C=C bond in SA [22] .",

The reason was that TiO 2 would decrease particle sizes and increase the specific surface area after modified by SA, ultimately enlarging the contact area between the catalyst and the bacteria suspension.

The curve in Fig. 8 showed the effect of the different in situ water content on the sterilization performance of the composite and the inactivation efficiency tendency of the composite was increasing firstly and then decreasing. When the ethanol volume was 60 mL, the catalyst showed its excellent sterilization activity. The interpretation for the tendency of inactivation performance was that Ti precursor failed to fully hydrolyze with little in situ water, and then the increasing of in situ water content accelerated the hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate, forming TiO 2 particles with small sizes and large specific surface area [23] , thus greatly enhancing the sterilization activity of the catalyst. However, when the in situ water content was over 60 mL, due to the excessive water dilution, resulting in the viscosity of TiO 2 sol, the crosslinking degree and polymerization degree of the polycondensate would significantly decrease, which hindered the crystal to the form complete structure in the subsequently solvothermal reaction [24] . Moreover, the reactants volume had greatly effect on the reactor filling degree and also affected the sterilization performance of the composite [25] . The low composite volume exhibited poor crystallinity for the low reactor filling degree at low reaction pressure. On the contrary, excessive volume composite showed too fast growth rate at high pressure. Therefore, the ethanol volume of 60 mL and the acetic acid volume of 40 mL were selected for further research. Figure 9 presented the influence of the hydrothermal temperature on the photocatalytic sterilization activity of the catalyst. The results showed that the catalyst prepared at the hydrothermal temperature of 180 \u00b0C exhibited excellent sterilization activity. The precursor reaction was incomplete at low hydrothermal temperature, making the low growth rate, little size and poor crystallinity of the catalyst [26] . With the increasing of hydrothermal temperature, it provided more energy for the crystal growth and accelerated the phase transformation of TiO 2 from rutile to anatase phase [27] . However, the fast supersaturation and crystallization rate might lead to the abnormal growth of the catalyst at too high hydrothermal reaction temperature [28] , and the synthesized powders were prone to agglomeration, decreasing the specific surface area of the crystals. More importantly, some SA would decompose, negatively affected its photocatalytic activity. Therefore, 180\u2103 was chosen as the optimum hydrothermal reaction temperature in this experiment.",

It turned out that the composite obtained in a short time was noncrystalline with TiO 2 particles obviously aggregation. Besides, less photogenerated electrons would be excited in the unit area of crystals, and the diffusion distance from the internal to surface would increase [29, 30] , which decreased photocatalytic activity of the composite. As the hydrothermal time increasing, the catalyst continuously would grow having better crystallization and the crystal particles distributed more uniformly [31] . However, when the hydrothermal reaction time was over 12 h, due to the gradually increasing of particles size, the defects on the crystal surface and the active sites decreased, resulting in the gradually decreasing of sterilization activity. Especially, when the hydrothermal reaction time was more than 24 h, the sterilization effect of the catalyst obvious rapidly decreased, for the overgrown crystals mutual extrude and engulf forming the uneven sizes.

The catalyst exhibited its best sterilization activity adding SA/TiO 2 to 1.0 g L \u22121 . When the catalyst dosage was less than 1.0 g L \u22121 , the log reduction increased rapidly due to the increasing contact area between the catalyst and bacteria, which created more active sites in the catalyst. Meanwhile, the ultraviolet utilization efficiency increased releasing more oxidizing groups [32] , rapidly increasing the sterilization effect of the catalyst. Nevertheless, the log reduction would decrease when the catalyst dosage was more than 1.0 g L \u22121 , for the catalyst concentration gradually increased and the bacteria suspension turbidity correspondingly increased, sheltering the light and reducing the transmittance of the solutions [33] . As a result, some catalysts away from the light source could not be stimulated by the UV light. On the other hand, the increasing of catalyst concentrations made some catalyst particles agglomerate each other [34] , and the electron hole pairs were easy to recombine, which weakened the sterilization properties of the catalyst. The log reduction of E. coli reached 4.41 log at the catalyst dosage of 1.0 g L \u22121 , compared to 0.7 g L \u22121 only 0.1 log higher. Therefore, the optimum economically dosage of catalyst was 0.7 g L \u22121 in this experiment.",

The effects of different irradiation time on the sterilization properties of SA/TiO 2 were investigated under ultraviolet lamp irradiated for 10, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min, respectively. The results were shown in Fig. 12 , it depicted that the log reduction of E. coli increased rapidly from 1.45 to 3.41 log at the irradiation time from 10 to 30 min, however, it increased slowly in 30 to 60 min. Irradiated by the continuous UV light, the increasing light quantum numbers provided more energy for the electronic excitation process of the catalyst, helpful for the oxidation groups to participate in the sterilization process. However, per unit volume of the catalyst content in the bacteria suspensions was fixed so that the formation efficiency of the electron-hole pairs gradually decreased when the radiation time reached 30 min. The increasing tendency of the log reduction of E. coli was quite slowly when the radiation time exceeded 60 min, due to the limitation of bacteria numbers. In short, the inactivation efficiency was relatively efficient when the radiation time was 60 min and the catalyst showed excellent sterilization performance at this condition.",

As a representative compound of DOM, humic acid (HA) had been widely used to evaluate the effect of natural organic matter on the environmental geochemical processes [35] . HA was a major component of humic substances coming from the decomposition of plants and animal [36] , and it belonged to a kind of chemically heterogeneous compound containing abundant functional groups such as phenolic, hydroxyl, and carboxyl. Some research showed that HA could be absorbed on the nanomaterials surface, and the functional groups of HA such as carboxylate and phenolic had a strong complexation effect probably affecting the photocatalytic performance of the nanomaterials [37] . Therefore, the disinfection of pathogens in water might be affected by HA and it was still urgent to investigate the effect of HA on SA/ [38] . In this work, the effect of different HA concentrations in the range of 3-18 mg L \u22121 on the disinfection performance of E. coli cells were investigated. As shown in Fig. 13 , the increasing of HA concentrations would decrease the disinfection efficiency and the decreasing tendency became obviously when the concentration reached 18 mg L \u22121 . The sterilization performance of the composite was slightly affected by the concentrations of HA which generally below 10 mg L \u22121 in actual water sources.",

The addition of SA made the band gap of TiO 2 slightly increased from 3.03 to 3.35 eV, implying the composite showed strongly response to the UV light. The optimum preparation parameters of the catalyst were n(Ti):n(SA) = 1:0.05, 60 mL ethanol and 40 mL glacial acetic acid at the hydrothermal temperature of 180 \u2103 for 12 h. The composite (0.7 g L \u22121 ) showed excellent photocatalytic sterilization performance, which could reach the log reduction of E. coli to 4.31 log under the UV light irradiation for 60 min. In a word, SA/TiO 2 provided a new path to hinder the agglomeration of TiO 2 nanoparticles by enhancing TiO 2 surface acidity, thus achieving a safe and effective drinking water disinfection method.",
