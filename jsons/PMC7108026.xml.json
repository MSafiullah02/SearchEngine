Respiratory specimens and environmental samples were collected and cultured from all patients during the later stages of clinical disease. After discharge of the MERS patients, we continued to collect environmental specimens for up to 24 or 120 hours. The respiratory specimens of the patients and the environmental specimens were tested for MERS by reverse transcription and PCR, and by virus culture [16]. The average temperature and humidity condition of the 4 rooms were 25.6\u00b0C and 52.2%. Three rooms of Chungbuk National University Hospital had 12 air-changes per hour and the average pressure gradient between the patient room and the anteroom was 9.1 hPa.

However, in room B the patient's room and medical equipment tested positive for viral RNA as late as 96 hours after the death of patient 3 from sudden aspiration (Table 2). It is noteworthy that medical equipment in the patient's room and anteroom began to test positive for viral RNA 1 day after the entrance of the MERS patient into room C. In room D, the patient's room and medical equipment was positive for the virus up to 120 hours after the patient's last positive PCR (Table 2). The RT-PCR results with the environmental specimens revealed that bed controllers (5 of 15 specimens, 33.3%), IV fluid hangers (5 of 14 specimens, 35.7%), anteroom desks (3 of 7 specimens, 42.8%), and bedrails (4 of 15 specimens, 26.7%) were frequently positive (Table 3). The detailed numbers of positive samples from all tested environmental specimens are summarized in Table 3. The duration of viral RNA detection from environmental specimens since the patient's last positive PCR ranged from 2 to 5 days. The environmental sampling was continued in rooms A, B, and C for the same time period due to the disinfection schedule for the new patients. Of note, viral RNAs were also detected in samples from the anteroom floors and anteroom desks of room C and room D, areas the patients couldn't reach by themselves. Furthermore, we also tested the environmental specimens from X-ray machines and thermometers, which were used for routine patient check-ups. RT-PCR and sequencing results revealed that 1 of 6 and 1 of 5 specimens from X-ray devices and thermometers, respectively, were positive for viral RNA suggesting that medical instruments could also be a source of virus spread. Infectious virus was also found in some environmental samples including those from bed sheets (room C), IV fluid hanger (room C), bedrail (room D), anteroom table (room D), and X-ray devices (room D) (Tables 2 and 3). It is noteworthy that the virus was recovered from the specimen taken from the IV fluid hanger in room C even on the day when the patient was negative for viral RNA as assessed by RT- PCR (Table 2).\n",

We could also detect MERS-CoV RNA on medical devices and air-ventilation equipment in isolation rooms. During the late clinical phase of MERS-CoV infection, viable virus could be isolated from 3 of the 4 enrolled patients between days 18 and 25 post-symptom onset. In addition, we could isolate viable MERS-CoV from some environmental surfaces, suggesting that MERS-CoV can be transmitted through contaminated environments and fomites.",

In rooms B and C, viral RNA of MERS-CoV was detected on environmental points where the patients could not reach due to their limited activity. This finding suggests that the contamination was caused by healthcare workers potentially exposed to high levels of infectious virus unwittingly contaminating the environment during patient care. These results might explain the unusual, rapid spread of MERS-CoV to visitors and people who did not share the same room during the MERS outbreak in South Korea. The massive contamination around the patients including beds, IV fluid stands, and X-ray machines prior to recognition of the first patient (20 May 2015) might have been a critical factor responsible for the amplified spread of MERS-CoV infection to visitors and people who did not share the same room, even in the emergency room of each hospital. Similar findings were made during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Canada, in which PCR-positive swab samples were recovered from frequently touched surfaces in patient rooms, on patient care equipment, and ventilation-system components [20].",

This finding suggests that infected patients can shed MERS-CoV in respiratory secretions for more than 20 days, which is longer than previously thought [21\u201323]. This prolonged viral shedding may result in the persistent contamination of the patient's environment even when clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities have resolved. Thus, careful infection control and prevention strategies should be applied to isolated MERS patients not only during the acute phase but also during recovery to prevent viral spread and further nosocomial infections. Our results also suggest that isolation and quarantine policy during a MERS outbreak should be considered on laboratory results (PCR or viral culture) rather than solely on improvements in patient symptoms.",

Moreover, they found that MERS-CoV was more stable than influenza A under various environmental settings [24]. This characteristic of MERS-CoV increases the likelihood of contact and fomite transmission, and therefore, when possible medical devices such as thermometers, X-ray devices, or IV fluid hangers should be retained in the patient room to avoid cross contamination. Furthermore, all medical devices should be cleaned thoroughly before leaving the patient's room.",

In addition, an anteroom provides space for healthcare workers to put on and take off Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Usually, medical devices used in patient rooms are disinfected in anterooms; thus, the anteroom is commonly considered to be a buffer zone. In our study, MERS-CoV was detected on anteroom floors and desks. This suggests that unless the anteroom is frequently disinfected, viable virus can be spread to the corridor by medical personnel or medical devices leaving patient rooms.",

Current guidelines suggest gloves, gowns, respirators, and eye protectors as PPE for MERS patient care [26]. In addition, during large MERS outbreaks, where hastily assembled anterooms may not be equipped with sinks for proper hand washing, double gloving may help to avoid spread by contact. Furthermore, because PPE may be contaminated by MERS-CoV during patient care, there is a need for more careful and comprehensive procedures for putting on and removing PPE and respirators, including double gloving, in order to improve infection control. To this end, mirrors placed in anterooms can assist healthcare workers in checking their PPE status before entering patient rooms and during removal of PPE to avoid contamination. Moreover, it is reasonable to assume that the surface of sample bottles and specimen cups may be contaminated by MERS and should be disinfected before transport to the hospital laboratory.",

Although we failed to isolate viable virus by cell culture (Table 3), it is noteworthy that viral RNA was detected on the entrance to air-ventilating equipment in 1 room, suggesting the potential existence of airborne-viral particles.
