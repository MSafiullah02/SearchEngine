Infection of the stomach also is strongly correlated with recurring peptic ulcer disease and with gastric cancers.73, 95 Readers are referred to Chapter 21 in this volume for a more detailed review of H pylori infection.",

The hypothesis that receptor analog therapy is an effective and safe form of treatment to prevent the systemic complications of EHEC infection is now being tested.93 This or other novel treatment approaches are required because antimicrobial agents are of unproven benefit. Theoretically, antibiotics could cause harm because the cytotoxins are released from the periplasm of the organism following exposure to agents that disrupt the prokaryotic outer membrane.
