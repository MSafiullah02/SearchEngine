In 1963, Dr. James Hardy performed the first human lung transplantation. The recipient survived 18 days, ultimately succumbing to renal failure and malnutrition [58]. From 1963 through 1978, multiple attempts at lung transplantation failed because of rejection and complications at the bronchial anastomosis. In the 1980s, improvements in immunosuppression, especially the introduction of cyclosporin A, and enhanced surgical techniques led to renewed interest in organ transplantation. In 1981, a 45-year-old-woman received the first successful heart\u2013lung transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) [106]. She survived 5 years after the procedure. Two years later the first successful single lung transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) [128] was reported, and in 1986 the first double lung transplantation for emphysema [25] was performed.",

Today, there are four major surgical approaches to lung transplantation: single and bilateral lung transplantation (BLT), heart\u2013lung transplantation, and transplantation of lobes of lungs from living donors. In 2007, 2,708 lung transplantation procedures were reported worldwide to the Registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) in adults, the highest number for any year until then [21]. In the same year, 93 lung transplantations were reported in children, the majority in adolescents (12\u201317 years old) [6]. Although the number of single lung transplantations has been relatively stable, BLTs have continuously increased within the past 15 years. In fact, in 2007, BLT was the most common lung transplantation procedure performed with 69% of all lung transplantation procedures, largely due to transplantation for cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive lung disease/emphysema which made up for 26.6 and 25.7% of all BLTs between 1995 and 2008 [21].",

However, since lung transplantation is a rapidly evolving field, there are no hard and fast rules about who may be transplanted. When choosing a transplantation procedure, several issues are considered including the shortage of organ donors, the original disease, and the center\u2019s experience with graft and patient survival. General guidelines for the selection of the procedure have been proposed [36] and are based on the nature of the underlying lung disease. While BLTs are mandatory for cystic fibrosis [35], this procedure has also become more popular for indications such as AAT, COPD, IPF, and IPAH. Single-lung transplantation is usually performed in patients with restrictive fibrotic lung disease, Eisenmenger syndrome with reparable cardiac anomaly, and older patients with COPD. Heart\u2013lung transplantation is considered in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome with irreparable cardiac defect, pulmonary hypertension with cor pulmonale, or end-stage lung disease with concurrent severe cardiac disease [83, 89]. Transplantation of lobes from living donors is a recently developed technique involving bilateral implantation of the lower lobes usually from two blood group\u2013compatible living donors. The procedure has been performed in patients with cystic fibrosis, although the indications have been recently broadened. The functional and survival outcomes are similar to those achieved with conventional transplantation of cadaveric lungs. Donation of a lobe decreases the donor\u2019s lung volume by an average of approximately 15%, which is not associated with long-term functional limitation.",

Usually, rejection is evaluated on transbronchial biopsies (see below Sect. 7.3). On only rare occasions, wedge biopsies are performed. Other specimens might include explants for retransplant or autopsy specimens. Acute rejection is characterized by perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates, which may be accompanied by sub-endothelial chronic inflammation (e.g., endotheliitis or intimitis), and also by lymphocytic bronchiolitis. In contrast, chronic rejection is manifest by fibrous scarring, involving the bronchioles and sometimes associated with accelerated fibrointimal changes affecting pulmonary arteries and veins. The presence of presumed irreversible dense eosinophilic hyaline fibrosis in airways and vessels remains the key histologic discriminator between acute and chronic rejection of lung. The histologic changes are divided into grades based on intensity of the cellular infiltrate, and the presence and absence of fibrosis.",

Chest radiograph displayed a completely opacified left lung, with homogenous infiltrates. Bronchoscopy revealed abundant pink frothy fluid draining from the allograft. Mean pulmonary artery pressure increased to 29 mmHg. The patient died 24 h later. At autopsy, the vascular and bronchial anastomoses appeared patent without signs of injury. The transplanted lung showed red hepatization and a firm consistency. Microscopically, signs of acute lung injury were evident. Although a pretransplant panel-reactive antibody (PRA) was negative, flowcytometry revealed 56 and 45% reactivity against HLA class I and II, respectively with anti-A2 detected among the preformed antibodies. Three other reported patients with hyperacute rejection died within 4 h to 13 days after transplantation [11, 19, 43, 116]. Although in three of the five reported patients pretransplant PRAs were negative, crossmatch was positive in all cases with anti-A2 the most common identified antibody. Collectively, although hyperacute rejection is rare after lung transplantation, one should keep this reaction in mind given that false-negative PRAs may occur and pretransplantation cross match is not often possible [29].",

Most patients develop at least one episode of acute rejection within the first 3 weeks following transplantation, typically in the first 5\u201310 days, with 36% of patients experiencing at least one episode in the first year [21]. Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) is the most common late cause of mortality and morbidity after lung transplantation occurring in 28% by 2.5 years and 74% by 10 years in patients who survive at least 14 days [21]. It also has a significant negative impact on quality of life parameters. Risks for acute rejection include HLA mismatching, type of immunosuppression, infection, and recipient factors. It is generally thought that the intensity of host alloimmune response is related to recipient recognition of differences with the donor HLA antigens and that this process drives acute lung allograft rejection. A higher degree of mismatch increases the risk of acute rejection [101, 115, 141]. However, this effect is not consistent across all HLA loci or studies. Mismatches at the HLA-DR, HLA-B [115], and HLA-A [101] loci, as well as a combination of all three loci [141], appear important. In addition, the ISHLT registry has not found a correlation between HLA mismatching and survival [130]. Thus, while HLA mismatching between donor and recipient likely contributes to the immunologic basis for acute rejection, it is difficult to discern if a mismatch at a particular locus or if different degrees of mismatch significantly alter the overall risk for acute rejection.",

As a consequence, a clinical definition, called bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) was proposed [24]. This is based on pulmonary function criteria, initially FEV1 evolution, and more recently, mid-expiratory flow rate (FEF25\u201375) [38].

Immune stimulation by prior infections or autoimmunity might contribute to the development of antibodies to alloMHC in those patients with no identifiable risk factors. These preexisting antibodies can react with donor antigens, leading to immediate graft loss (hyperacute rejection) or accelerated humoral rejection and BOS [23]. Furthermore, recent studies have consistently demonstrated an increased incidence of acute rejection (a threefold increase in one study) [48], persistent rejection, increased BOS [96] or worse overall survival [56] in patients with anti-HLA antibodies. This effect is apparent both with pretransplant HLA sensitization and with the development of de novo anti-HLA donor-specific antibodies after transplantation [96].",

PTLDs most commonly are associated with EBV infection of B-cells either by reactivation of latent virus or primary EBV, most commonly acquired from donor organs [12]. A recent study showed [37] that five of seven lung-transplanted children who developed PTLD were EBV-negative recipients who received EBV-positive lungs. In a series [81] of 988 heart and/or lung transplant recipients, 17 PTLDs were identified. Amongst the 17 PTLD cases, there were two B-cell monoclonal polymorphic PTLDs and 15 B-cell monomorphic PTLDs (see Fig. 7.11) (13 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) and two Burkitt lymphomas). EBV was detected in 9 of the 17 patients. All cases showed monoclonal IGV gene rearrangements; IGV somatic hypermutation was found in 88% of cases, indicating a prevalent origin from germinal center-experienced B cells.\n",

Mediastinal and hilar adenopathy also can be observed in 22\u201350% of cases. Patients who present with a solitary pulmonary nodule have a better overall prognosis. However, most PTLDs have a rapid onset, a predilection for extranodal sites, and an aggressive clinical behavior with poor outcome [15, 69, 70, 78, 100]. As a result of the high mortality associated with PTLD, treatment often poses a challenge. The most common treatment of PTLD has included decreasing immunosuppression in combination with surgical resection, antiviral agents, radiation, and chemotherapy [45, 103, 109]. The reduction or withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy may result in a partial or complete regression of the PTLD [69]. A higher risk of graft rejection associated with PTLD treatment is one reason for the need for early detection of the disease [45, 102, 103, 109].",

A few days later, profuse, green, watery diarrhea developed with abdominal pain and paralytic ileus. Colonoscopy showed ulceration of mucosa and destruction of intestinal crypts, features compatible with Gvhd. There was leucopenia, severe anemia, and deterioration of liver function. The diagnosis was confirmed by chimerism study that revealed a recipient/donor lymphocyte ratio of 50:50. A second case of acute Gvhd after lung transplantation was successfully treated with corticosteroids [5]. This patient presented with mild symptoms (pruritic rash and blurry vision) suggesting low-grade Gvhd.

Microscopically, the bronchiectasis may be associated with areas of mucous plugging, goblet cell hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, denudation of the bronchial epithelium, submucosal scarring, and acute and chronic inflammation of the bronchial wall. Occasionally foreign body giant cells are present, probably representing a manifestation of aspiration. Obliteration of the terminal respiratory bronchioles is often observed distal to these areas. The bronchiectasis of lung allografts is probably the result of several factors including immune-related injury, infection, mucostasis, aspiration, and loss of innervation.",

The improvement in survival is largely due to improvement in the 1 year survival. Long term survival has improved as well, although to a seemingly lesser degree.

For instance, the survival half-life for patients older than 65 years of age was 3.2 years compared with 6.3 years for those aged 35\u201349. Overall survival rates at 3 months after transplantation are lowest for IPF (86%) and IPAH (78%) and highest for CF (91%) and COPD (91%), most likely due to differences in early complications, including PGD [21].
