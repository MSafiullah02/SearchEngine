It is important that the users are provided with updated versions of the system on a regular basis. 50,57,60  Updates must be referable to unique consistent version identifiers. This identifier is for instance used in the communication with the users for collection of change proposals. 61,62  New releases of a TS can be distributed in different ways. One option is to provide a full version of the system each time an update of the system is available (non-incremental update). Another option is to provide a list with the accepted changes that can be imported into the previous version of the system (incremental update). 61  The choice of the update method depends on the volume and the complexity of the changes made. The update frequency is sufficiently low in order to quickly accommodate new concepts and repairs. 63  On average, twice a year a new release of a TS is launched. 36,57,60  However, this update frequency does depend on the content and the purpose of a TS. For instance, the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT\u00ae) containing three types of categories (I\u2013III), has a different updating scheme for each category depending on its intended usage. 54,64  Once approved by the Editorial Panel, the newly added Category I CPT concepts are distributed annually whereas the category II CPT concepts are distributed every two years. Since Category III CPT concepts are used to report emerging technologies and must respond quickly to changes in treatment methods, Category III CPT concepts are updated twice a year. The update frequency also depends on how the TS is distributed. Printed revisions will necessarily be produced less frequently than revisions of a computerized system. Electronic updates have the advantage of being accessible more quickly or even instantaneously. 49  Furthermore, distribution of updates may need to be coordinated with updates of related TSs.",

Change operations that do affect the hierarchy, e.g., changes in concept definition or addition of concepts, are more complex because they must adhere to the constraints set by the change policy and often also lead to changes in existing concepts. Differences in the TS structure and content may lead to differences in allowable change operations within each TS. In general, for a TS that distinguishes concepts from terms, the change model includes addition, obsolete marking and amendments of the concepts, relationships and terms. 12  Additional change operations may be applicable to terminological systems based on their typology and content architecture (for example, if they provide cross mapping or composition rules). 19  The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Thesaurus for example uses a change model, that satisfies the change policies described above, and contains the following change operations: 59  \u2022 Create concept, i.e., assign Unique ID number, Concept Code, and Concept Name,\u2022 Modify concept, i.e., additions, deletions, or changes that do not change the concept's definition,\u2022 Split concept, i.e., a concept is redefined by partitioning its defining attributes over two concepts, one of which retains the original concept's code, and the second of which is newly created during the split action. Ambiguities in the original concept's meaning are clarified by narrowing its definition,\u2022 Merge concepts, i.e., multiple ambiguous concepts are combined into one concept,\u2022 Retire concept, i.e., a concept is marked obsolete: previous taxonomic placement information is retained.

This is reflected by the criterion of a short response time (i.e., time needed to handle a proposal or a questions) of the maintenance team with respect to proposals and questions. Still, in the existing literature, no concrete indication is provided for what the response time should be. In our study, the mean response time of the maintenance teams varies between 26.8 days for quartile I, and 6.7 days for quartile III. Almost all respondents wish to reduce their response time for processing the proposals. This is particularly the case for TSs in the first quartile.",

The lack of specific literature and the fact that the framework prescribes the use of centralized maintenance model are the reasons that the use of semantic wikis as potential editing tools for TS maintenance was not specifically included in the framework or in the questionnaire.
