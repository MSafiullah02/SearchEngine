More specifically, we question the standard assumption in the literature on epidemiological models, where the transmission rate dictating propagation of infections is taken to be proportional to the product between the infected and susceptible sub-populations; a model that relies on strong mixing between the two groups and widespread contact between members of the groups. We content, that contact between infected and susceptible individuals, especially during the early phases of an epidemic, takes place over a (possibly diffused) boundary between the respective sub-populations. As a result, the rate of transmission depends on the product of fractional powers instead. The intuition relies on the fact that infection grows in geographically concentrated cells, in contrast to the standard product model that relies on complete mixing of the susceptible to infected sub-populations. We validate the hypothesis of fractional exponents i) by numerical simulation for disease propagation in graphs imposing a local structure to allowed disease transmissions and ii) by fitting the model to a",

The justification for such a model stems from the fact that, at least during the initial phase of an epidemic, infection propagates outwards from infected cells to the general population. In such a scenario, where for instance S(t) I(t) (much greater), the boundary of infected cells which would roughly account for most new infections, scales as a fractional power \u03b3 < 1 of the area of the cells, hence I(t) \u03b3 . In actuality, due to the diffusive nature of infection-propagation amongst the general population, the exponent is expected to be larger than 1/2, as it would be in the continuous limit when the boundary is a smooth curve. Moreover, at least in the early phases of an epidemic, the exponent of S(t), which is significantly larger than I(t) may turn out to be negligible.",

In the model, the parameters a and b quantify anabolism (growth) and catabolism (death), respectively. Equation (3) may be interpreted as asserting that the net growth rate of an organism results from the balance of synthetic and degradative mechanisms. While the rate of the former process follows a law of allometry (i.e., the rate is proportional to the volume V (t) via a power function), the rate of the latter process scales linearly with V (t). It is important to note that the two special cases of (3), (i) power law b = 0, and (ii) second-type growth \u03bb = 2/3 have already been successfully applied to describe tumor growth [9] , [4] . The general case, 0 < \u03bb < 1, was introduced in [8] to explain the self-seeding hypothesis. Moreover, an important geometrical interpretation was provided in [7] , [1] . In these works, the authors relate the exponent \u03bb = d/3 to the fractional Hausdorff dimension of the proliferative tissue, where d denotes the fractal dimension of the tissue. Moreover, the model (3) has been derived mechanistically by linking tumor growth to metabolic rate and vascularization [5] .",

To this end, we seek to explain the origin of fractional power in (2) by i) numerical experiments, and ii) fitting such models to data sets. Specifically, with respect to i), we postulate a discrete model where infection propagates over nodes of a network. The network, representing individuals, is not planar (in general), yet it is immersed in R 2 . While (physically) neighboring nodes may be densely connected, precluding the graph from being planar, the likelihood of being connected as well as infecting each other is regulated by a parameter that is a function of their physical distance. It is observed, universally, that such models lead to fractional exponents in the transmission rate, in agreement with (2) . With regard to ii), we have also numerically studied data on recent COVID-19 epidemic that is available at [3] . For this dataset, as we note in the results, the exponent \u03b3 in (2) ranges from about 0.6 to 0.8, which is similar to the empirically determined exponent of the NSM model.",

We study the relationship between the number of newly infected \u2206I(t) and the total recorded number of infected I(t) individuals for the duration 01/31 to 03/24, in Italy, Germany, Iran, and France. The number of newly infected individuals is approximated by subtracting the number of infected people at time t from the number of infected people at time t \u2212 1, as information on those recovering is not available. We fitted the curve \u2206I(t) = cI(t) \u03b3 to the data; due to the fact that S(t) I(t) during these initial stages of infection spread S(t) is treated as constant. The result for four different countries is depicted in Figure 5 .",

            "text": "The main thesis of this work is that models of epidemics, especially at early phases, incorrectly assume that the contagion depends on the product of infected and susceptible populations. Contagion takes place at the boundary of infected cells and as a result it is the topology of the distribution of infected cells that dictate the spread. Thus, we propose a fractional-power alternative to the standard SIR model. Our thesis appears to be supported by simulation results as well as by fitting this model to recent COVID-19 datasets. Specifically, the two-dimensional discrete probabilistic SIR models in Figure 2 (with a nearest neighbor connection) and in Figure 3 (with a two-step nearest neighbor connection), suggest exponent of 0.50 \u2212 0.77 for the contribution of I(t) on the infection rate. It should be noted that, although these plots depict \u2206I vs. I(t), whereas the third abscissa for S(t) is not shown. Similar results are observed in Figure 4 for a two-dimensional random distribution of nodes (vertex set) with four nearest-neighbor contacts (edge set). Here, the exponent of the I(t) contribution to the infection rate lies in a similar range ({0.58, 0.64} for the conditions displayed).",

In this data-set, the value of S(t) (that includes the remaining of a rather large total population) varies insignificantly over time, and hence treated as a constant. Several limitations of our experiment are noted. Firstly, the value of I(t) is only an estimated value since recording of all infected individuals is not guaranteed. Secondly, the value of \u2206I(t) is estimated as being the difference I(t) \u2212 I(t \u2212 1). Thus, we do not take into account individuals who may have recovered. However, it is deemed that the uncertainty in the actual value of R(t) is not significant as, from available information in the rapidly developing COVID-19 epidemic, it appears that the recovery rate is of the order of weeks.",
