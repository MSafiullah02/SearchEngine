Fosphenytoin can also be administered via intramuscular route when IV access is not available; however, this is not always an appropriate route of administration for status epilepticus. IV phenytoin is a cost-effective option; however, use is associated with serious adverse events, including purple glove syndrome and cardiac abnormalities. In some patients, the large initial loading doses of IV phenytoin or fosphenytoin are associated with cardiovascular adverse effects, including hypotension and bradyarrhythmias.

Special attention is needed for patients at risk for cerebral edema who require isotonic IV fluids. Table 3 provides a comparison of fluid components.Evaluate total fluid requirements for surgeries. The American College of Surgeons 2014 Principle and Practice notes total volume replacement needs for elective surgeries are much less (500 mL to 3000 mL total) than traditionally thought (4500 mL to 6000 mL total) [26].Evaluate the clinical need for IV fluid replacement and \u201ckeep vein open\u201d orders at every shift change. Consider catheter locks and flushes for eligible patients.

In a publication from 2018, a group of physicians from the Emergency Department at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital developed a protocol for using oral rehydration therapy in patients presenting with mild dehydration from conditions such as pharyngitis, gastroenteritis, pregnancy-related vomiting, and upper respiratory tract infection [30]. Patients deemed to be experiencing severe dehydration or who were unable to take liquids by mouth were excluded from the protocol. The authors administered 500 to 1000 mL of oral fluids, including oral electrolyte solutions, water, dilute juice, or dilute sport drinks. Considerations for use of specific products on the basis of concomitant disease states such as renal disease, diabetes mellitus, or heart failure were recommended. Patients were instructed to drink 30 mL (two large sips) every 3\u20135 min with specific instructions for drinking goals and the use of tracking sheets. Comfort medications such as analgesics, antipyretics, and anti-emetics were administered as needed. Through the use of this protocol, the authors were able to reduce the use of IV fluids by an estimated 30%. In patients, unable to take medications by mouth but with enteral access via a nasogastric or orogastric tube, oral rehydration therapies can be administered as needed.",

Utilizing a fixed-dose strategy may be effective in conserving PCC4 supply rather than using the FDA-approved dose based on weight and initial INR. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is not recommended as first-line treatment for warfarin reversal by the Neurocritical Care Society/Society of Critical Care Medicine guideline for the reversal of anti-thrombotics in intracranial hemorrhage [35]. Additionally, the American Heart Association guideline for the management of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage recommends against the administration of rFVIIa because it fails to replenish all of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and does not restore thrombin generation as effectively as PCC [46]. The INR is particularly sensitive to factor VII levels and may decrease despite inadequate levels of factors II, IX, and X that are required for hemostasis [35]. It also has a very short half-life of about 3 h leading to INR rebound [47]. rFVIIa is associated with a high rate of thrombosis (12.8\u201324%), including a 5% excess risk of arterial thrombosis compared to placebo with intra-parenchymal hemorrhage [35, 48].",

Neurointerventionalists at many institutions nationwide use abciximab during neurointerventional procedures as rescue therapy for thromboembolism during procedures such as coil embolization or stenting. In the field of cardiology, many providers say that the shortage has gone unnoticed as they were already relying on other GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors and those that were using abciximab have easily made the switch to an alternative agent such as tirofiban [53]. In the neurointerventional field, however, the transition to an alternative GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor is not as straightforward. The indications for these agents in neurointerventional procedures are off-label, and the literature in support of alternative agents is limited to small, non-randomized evaluations with heterogeneous dosing.

Similarly no significant differences in efficacy were found when abciximab, an irreversible agent, was compared with the reversible agents tirofiban and eptifibatide in these case series [54]. Of note, a limited meta-analysis has demonstrated higher recanalization rates with the reversible GPIIb/IIIa agents compared to abciximab [55]. From a practical standpoint, tirofiban compared to abciximab is less expensive, does not require a filter needle or refrigeration prior to administration, and has a shorter effective half-life of hours compared to days. These practical benefits are tempered by less evidence and less clinical experience by neurointerventionalists. Further, in the setting of bleeding, tirofiban inhibits platelets administered by platelet transfusion until it is eliminated since it reversibly inhibits platelets. Abciximab irreversibly inhibits platelets and will inhibit platelets administered by platelet transfusion up to 30 min after the drug administration. Beyond 30 min, most free drug has been eliminated and the remaining abciximab is unable to release from its binding site. There are no head-to-head studies comparing bleeding risks in the neurointerventional patient population. Providers need to ensure that tirofiban dosing is adjusted in the setting of renal dysfunction (CrCl < 60 mL/min).",

A low-dose infusion of tirofiban 0.08 mcg/kg/min may be used to bridge the patient to a P2Y12 inhibitor and will be continued until the P2Y12 inhibitor loading dose is at maximal efficacy [56]. Another protocol mirrors cardiac bolus dosing for eptifibatide of up to 180 mcg/kg as a loading dose administered intra-arterially [57].

Furthermore, the electronic health record should be updated to display opioid options that match products currently in stock as well as providing alternative alerts with other options. Inventory control strategies should include reserving supplies of specific IV opioids for specific indications and limiting their placement to those areas with those indications.

Clinical decision support systems within the CPOE system can assist providers with medication ordering. Drug shortage alerts can be incorporated into the CPOE system to communicate restricted use and/or direct providers to an alternative therapy [62].

Initial strategies for drug shortages may include adjusting par levels of medications stocked in the automatic dispensing cabinets [7]. Prioritizing distribution of short-dated (i.e., soon-to-expire) medications allows for increased time of drug utilization, less inventory required to order, and decreased waste [63]. Throughout the process, it is essential that the CPOE and pharmacy system product preference list is updated accordingly. Medication package selection (e.g., a 2 mL vial of diazepam 5 mg/mL versus 10 mL vial of diazepam 5 mg/mL) may prefer products stocked on the unit in the automated dispensing cabinet over those distributed from central pharmacy. As such, manipulation of inventory available in the automated dispensing cabinet can facilitate correct product selection on order verification [7]. If a shortage becomes significant enough to deplete central pharmacy supply, centralization of inventory may be required to allow for distribution of medication to patients throughout the hospital. If unit-dosed medications are on shortage, purchasing of bulk bottles and repacking into smaller dosage units may help mitigate the impact of drug shortages until resolution.",

One retrospective study of 26 US hospitals showed that among patients with septic shock, a norepinephrine shortage was associated with an absolute increase in in-hospital mortality of 3.7% (adjusted odds ratio 1.15, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.30) [65]. The authors hypothesized that the increase in mortality was due to a combination of the use of potentially inferior vasopressors for septic shock such as phenylephrine and dopamine, lack of familiarity with alternative options, and inadequate optimization of supply management during the shortage. Another retrospective study of three intensive care units (ICUs) in Vienna in which remifentanil was the continuous infusion analgesic of choice demonstrated a longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU and hospital length of stay associated with a remifentanil shortage [66]. The authors postulated that the use of unfamiliar and longer-acting alternatives may have led to suboptimal dosage adjustments and prolonged respiratory depression, impairing ventilator weaning. Additional studies are needed to assess the impact of drug shortages on patient outcomes.",
