We only found 14 cases with RSV as the single causative agent for SARI. Considering the incidence of RSV-associated hospitalizations, this is lower than expected [17] . We were able to benchmark our algorithm, although it seems to be very stringent and results in an underestimation of the true HBoV epidemiology. It is therefore of note that we did not set out to estimate the true burden of disease of HBoV, but to establish whether HBoV by itself can cause SARI. Our study is subject to several limitations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 323, "end": 327, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "964.e5"}, {"text": "It may be argued that the retrospective nature of this study and its inherent limitations may have resulted in a sample bias. Blood samples for HBoV serology or PCR were not obtained, because these are not routinely tested at our hospital. Furthermore, not all bacteriology samples were obtained, as more invasive procedures would have had to be carried out to fully rule out the role of bacteria in lower respiratory tract infections. These are currently not routinely practiced in critically ill children for ethical and technical reasons. As an alternative we set strict CRP levels to our inclusion criteria. Based on previously published data we set a lower cut-off for bacterial co-infections (40 mg/L) than the usually applied 80 mg/L, to minimize the contribution of bacterial infections to the observed disease. In addition, during non-structured follow up, none of the patients showed an increase in CRP levels >80 mg/ L. Still, in two cases a moderate increase was observed and it should be noted that despite these low CRP levels, bacterial involvement cannot be fully ruled out based on CRP levels alone [28] [29] [30] . Other biomarkers such as pro-calcitonin and interleukins could have been used to differentiate between bacterial and viral infections, but these were not carried out in our hospital [30, 31] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1116, "end": 1120, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1121, "end": 1125, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1126, "end": 1130, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1315, "end": 1319, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1320, "end": 1323, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "964.e5"}, {"text": "Based on our findings we conclude that a single HBoV infection can cause SARI in children in the absence of viral and bacterial co-infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "964.e5"}, {"text": "This work was financially supported by the Virgo consortium, which is funded by the Dutch government project number FES0908.
