Therefore, the development of COVID-19 testing kits is still an open area of research. Recently, many studies have shown that chest Computed Tomography(CT) images can be used for COVID-19 testing, as chest CT images show a bilateral change in COVID-19 infected patients. However, the classification of COVID-19 patients from chest CT images is 15 not an easy task as predicting the bilateral change is defined as an ill-posed problem. Therefore, in this paper, a deep transfer learning technique is used to classify COVID-19 infected patients. Additionally, a top-2 smooth loss function with cost-sensitive attributes is also utilized to handle noisy and imbalanced COVID-19 dataset kind of problems.",
