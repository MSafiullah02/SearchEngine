She had been on\u2010and\u2010off febrile (maximal body temperature 40\u00b0C) with worsening productive cough of yellow sputum for 2 weeks despite visiting her general practitioner twice and a course of Augmentin (GlaxoSmithKline UK, Middlezex, UK; standard dosage of 914 mg/10 mL, twice daily for 1 week). She had post\u2010tussive vomiting and her appetite poor. Her immunizations were up to date except for pneumococcal vaccination. She travelled to Shenzhen in Mainland China and was hospitalized and treated with intravenous medication, but her symptoms persisted. Therefore, the patient was taken back to a hospital in Hong Kong the next day. At the emergency department, her vitals were: heart rate 131/min, respiratory rate 20/min, blood pressure (BP): 103/60 mmHg, tympanic temperature 38.6\u00b0C and SaO2 90% in room air. Percussion notes were dull and air entry to the right lung decreased. Chest radiography showed patchy right\u2010sided consolidations with pleural effusion (Fig. 1). She was immediately treated with oxygen (4 L/min via nasal cannula), intravenous cefotaxime and oral azithromycin to cover pneumococcus and atypical pathogens. Cloxacillin was added to cover possible Staphylococcus aureus infection.",

            "text": "MP is one of the most common agents of community\u2010acquired atypical pneumonia (AP) in children and young adults. The epidemiologic characteristics, including periodic epidemics, and some clinical characteristics of MP are similar to those observed in systemic viral infections 1. AP caused by MP has been called \u2018walking pneumonia\u2019 because it usually affects older children and seldom results in PICU admission 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Nevertheless, the pathogen can occasionally cause severe acute respiratory symptoms (sars) 4, 7, 9, 11. Rarely, mycoplasma can co\u2010infect children and result in very severe and even fatal disease 12. Literature on the incidence and mortality of severe AP with MP requiring PICU care is reviewed. Six, 165 and 293 articles were found when PubMed (a service of the US National Library of Medicine) was searched for the terms \u2018mycoplasma\u2019 and \u2018ICU\u2019, \u2018mycoplasma\u2019 and \u2018mortality\u2019, and \u2018mycoplasma\u2019 and severe', with limits activated (ages: birth to 18 years), respectively, as of March 2013. These publications are used to address the clinical questions as to the epidemiology of MP, PICU admission and mortality. Mortality and PICU admission associated with MP is general low and rarely reported 3, 4, 8. One study indicated that patients with MP\u2010associated encephalitis are predominantly pediatric, and they frequently require intensive care with prolonged hospitalizations 5. In a large Chinese study on etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital\u2010acquired pneumonia in children, mycoplasma was only reported in 0.4% 3, 4, 8. Nevertheless, recent MP infections play a significant role in exacerbations of asthma and occurrence of status asthmaticus in children 4. A retrospective review of all patients admitted to PICU over a 12\u2010month period with status asthmaticus showed evidence of recent mycoplasma infection [by Immunocard Mycoplasma Enzyme Immunoassay for detection of MP immunoglobulin M antibodies (Meredian Diagnostics, Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA)] in 42% 3, 4, 8. There were no statistically significant differences in length of hospitalization, ICU days, duration of continuous albuterol aerosol, days on oxygen or white blood cell counts between the two groups. However, patients who were mycoplasma positive were treated with a macrolide antibiotic in addition to their standard asthma therapy. Patients with evidence of recent MP infection were more likely to have one or more infiltrates on their chest radiography. The authors reported no mortality reported in the series. Full respiratory recovery and ICU discharge has been reported despite persistent acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory impairment and hypoxia in a patient with Down syndrome 3, 4, 8.",

            "text": "Macrolide resistance in MP has been investigated in a number of publications. Some patients with MP infection are clinically resistant to antibiotics such as erythromycin (EM), clarithromycin or clindamycin. The relationship between the point mutation pattern of EM\u2010resistant strains and their resistance phenotypes to several macrolide antibiotics was investigated in a Japanese study, which isolated MP from patients and found that one of three isolates showed a point mutation in the 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene 18, 19. Furthermore, 141 EM\u2010sensitive clinical isolates of MP were cultured in broth medium containing 100 microg/mL of EM. Among 11 EM\u2010resistant strains that grew in the medium, point mutations in the 23S rRNA were found in three strains at A2063G, five strains at A2064G and three strains at A2064C. During an outbreak of MP infections in southern Italy in 2010, 48 clinical specimens from 43 pediatric patients hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infections were analyzed for macrolide resistance 18, 19. The mutations associated with resistance (A2063G and A2064G) and MP subtypes were detected by sequencing the targeted domain V region of the 23S rRNA gene and a region in the MPN528a gene, respectively. Macrolide resistance genotypes were detected in 11 (26%) of the 43 MP\u2010positive children. The A2063G mutation was identified in seven patients, and the A2064G mutation was identified in the remaining four. Upon admission, the isolates from three patients showed a susceptible genotype but subsequently acquired the A2063G mutation. Genotyping revealed MP subtype 1 in 33 of 40 sequenced strains and subtype 2 in the remaining 7. There was no association between macrolide resistance or susceptibility and the MP subtypes. Locally, Lung et al. reported that macrolide\u2010resistant MP accounted for 33% (3 out of 10 patients) of the PCR\u2010confirmed cases 20. A recent Hong Kong study identified A2063G macrolide\u2010resistant MP quasispecies populations in 78.8% of the respiratory specimens 21.",

Amoxicillin should be used as first\u2010line therapy for previously healthy, appropriately immunized infants and preschool\u2010aged children with mild to moderate CAP suspected to be of bacterial origin. Amoxicillin provides appropriate coverage for S. pneumoniae, the most prominent invasive bacterial pathogen. Macrolide antibiotics (such as azithromycin) should be prescribed for treatment of children (primarily school\u2010aged children and adolescents) evaluated in an outpatient setting with findings compatible with CAP caused by atypical pathogens 23. There is no need to change macrolide use in the case of mild to moderate disease, but tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones should be considered if the symptoms persist or there are signs of a clinical deterioration, especially in countries in which macrolide\u2010resistant MP strains are very common 24. Laboratory testing for MP should be performed if available in a clinically relevant time frame. Empiric combination therapy with a macrolide (oral or parenteral), in addition to a beta\u2010lactam antibiotic, should be prescribed for the hospitalized child for whom MP and Chlamydia pneumoniae are significant considerations; diagnostic testing should be performed if available in a clinically relevant time frame. Co\u2010infections by viral and bacterial agents in critically ill patients have been reported 25, 26, 27, 28. These pathogens are known to cause pneumonia on their own and both are not commonly carried by healthy young persons 22, 26.",
