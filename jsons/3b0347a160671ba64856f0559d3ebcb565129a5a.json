The patient could not tolerate lying flat due to severe coughing spells and emesis, so she underwent elective intubation and was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Pericardiocentesis yielded 800 mL of exudative bloody fluid [fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 1,697 IU/L, pericardial fluid LDH/serum LDH >0.6]. Fluid cytology was negative for malignant cells. Acidfast bacilli smear was negative and there was no growth on cultures. Samples of the fluid were frozen in an effort to test the presence of SARS-CoV-2 which is currently not available in our center. Serum autoimmune workup was negative. In the absence of a history of malignancy, chest trauma, or coagulopathy, we suspected the hemorrhagic effusion to be secondary to COVID-19. Treatment was started with hydroxychloroquine along with colchicine and glucocorticoids given elevated serum inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein (15.9 mg/dL; RR <0.5 mg/dL), ferritin (593 ng/mL; RR 11-307 ng/mL), D-dimer (6.52 \u00b5g/mL; RR <0.68 \u00b5g/mL) and interlukin-6 (8 pg/mL; RR \u22645 pg/mL). Serial TTEs demonstrated resolution of the pericardial effusion, however, the patient was found to have new hypokinesis of the apical and periapical walls concerning for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) (Video 3). This coincided with a rise in cTnI levels to 2,410 (ng/L) and deep T wave inversions in precordial leads (V2-V6) ( Figure 3 ). The patient did not develop any chest pain or worsening dyspnea. On the contrary, she reported improvement of dyspnea and was subsequently discharged from the hospital.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is the novel virus that causes COVID-19 (1). Early studies from Wuhan, China demonstrated that patients commonly develop fever, upper respiratory symptoms and pneumonia (2) . As the disease spread globally, reports of extrapulmonary manifestations have been frequently identified, however, pericardial involvement has been rarely reported (3, 4) . Herein, we report the case of a patient who developed large symptomatic hemorrhagic pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade. There were no initial signs of cardiac injury or myocardial involvement as demonstrated by the absence of cTnI elevation or wall motion abnormalities on TTE. In fact, her symptoms were relatively mild until the development of pericardial effusion. Viral infections are a common cause of pericarditis and typically entail a benign clinical course (5) . Hemorrhagic pericardial effusions have been less commonly associated with viral infections but have been reported in Coxsackievirus (6) . It is hypothesized that viruses cause pericardial inflammation via direct cytotoxic effects and/or via immune-mediated mechanisms (5) . COVID-19 has been reported to trigger an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response in certain patients, however, details of this response are not fully understood (3) . It is plausible that COVID-19, like other viral infections, elicits an inflammatory response leading to pericarditis and subsequent effusion, however, the exact mechanism is unclear. Hemorrhagic effusions have also been reported in other inflammatory states such as Dressler's syndrome, which is thought to result from an immune complex deposition and a subsequent inflammatory cascade post myocardial infarction (7, 8) .",

TTC is a stress induced cardiomyopathy characterized by transient apical ballooning with regional wall motion abnormalities that occur in association with identifiable emotional or physical stressors including infections (9) . The Mayo Clinic proposed the following diagnostic criteria for diagnosis of TTC: transient segmental left ventricular systolic dysfunction, absence of obstructive coronary artery disease, new ECG abnormalities or modest cardiac troponin elevation and absence of pheochromocytoma or myocarditis (9) . Our patient met these diagnostic criteria clinically and echocardiogram was consistent with apical ballooning. Cardiac magnetic resonance would have definitively ruled out the presence of myocarditis, however, it was not performed as the patient's condition continued to improve and to further avoid non-essential medical testing to minimize spread of the disease. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was unlikely as coronary angiography from two years ago showed no significant coronary artery disease and the patient demonstrated no symptoms of ACS. While TTC has been widely reported in the setting of severe bacterial infections, cases of TTC attributed to viral infections such as influenza are rare (10) . In our case, troponin elevation and apical hypokinesis occurred only after intubation and pericardiocentesis, therefore stress from these procedures is also a possible etiology.",
