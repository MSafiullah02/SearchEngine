We investigated whether immunologic dysregulation contributes to these complaints. Cytokine and chemokine production was measured after stimulating monocytes of QFS patients and age-and sex-matched healthy controls with LPS and several viral ligands. The H3K4me3 mark of open chromatin was measured at the promoter regions of cytokines and chemokines that differed significantly from healthy controls. Monocytes of QFS patients produced significantly less TNF-\u03b1 (p = 0.032), IL-1\u03b2 (0.004, 0.024, and 0.008), IL-6 (0.043), RANTES (0.033), IP-10 (0.049), MCP-1 (0.022), IL-13 (0.029), and IL-10 (0.026) than healthy controls when stimulated with various ligands. H3K4me3 expression was significantly lower in QFS patients than in healthy controls on the promoter regions of IL-1\u03b2 (p = 0.004), MCP-1 (<0.001 and <0.001), IP-10 (<0.001), IL-10 (0.041), and IL-13 (<0.001, <0.001, and 0.",

Initial infection with C. burnetii remains asymptomatic in around 60% of cases, but can also manifest as symptomatic disease, acute Q fever, usually manifesting as a flu-like illness that is sometimes accompanied by hepatitis or pneumonia [1, 2] . The Netherlands experienced the largest Q fever outbreak ever reported between 2007 and 2011. It is estimated that at least 32 200 individuals were infected, and around 4000 patients notified having a symptomatic acute Q fever infection [3] . During an acute Q fever infection, the C. burnetii bacterium resides inside the phagolysosomes of monocytes and macrophages [1, 2] . In order to survive and replicate in the phagolysosome, or Coxiella containing vacuole, of these cells, C. burnetii is known to alter and subvert various host cell processes [4, 5] .",

It was shown that monocytes and likely also myeloid progenitor cells are able to acquire long-lasting immunologic memory (also termed \"trained immunity\") through epigenetic remodeling at the promoter regions of various cytokines [11, 12] . Depending on their initial challenge, these cells show altered (decreased or increased) responses to secondary challenges such as infections [13, 14] . Given these findings, it could be hypothesized that QFS patients who experience more frequent and severe upper respiratory tract infections since their acute Q fever infection, exhibit epigenetic remodeling of chromatin at the level of immune genes involved in host defense against viral upper respiratory tract infections. This remodeling could then result in altered cytokine responses to such infections. We test this hypothesis by conducting in vitro stimulation experiments on monocyte responsiveness of QFS patients with frequently recurring and severe upper respiratory tracts infections, together with an investigation of epigenetic changes at various cytokine promoter regions of these monocytes.",

Most research on the role of antiviral cytokine and chemokine responses was done on Influenza. When looking at disease severity, human studies show consensus and indicate toward an association with increased cytokine and chemokine responses [16, 17] . Studies on disease susceptibility are however scarce, mainly consist of mouse models, and show conflicting results. Both positive and negative associations are found when looking at disease severity, morbidity, and mortality in mice deficient for IL-6 [18] and IL-1 [19, 20] , MCP-1 [21] , and IP-10 [21] receptors. Nonetheless, it is conceivable that the decreased cytokine responses in our cohort of QFS patients contribute to an increased susceptibility to viral upper respiratory tract infections. Previous studies on cytokine responses in QFS found that white blood cells of QFS patients produce higher amounts of IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 when exposed to Coxiella antigen [8, 9] . One could therefore argue that immune regulation in QFS is ligand dependent, which makes it challenging to decipher its exact underlying immunopathologic mechanisms. It should be noted that this study solely included QFS patients who experience more frequent and severe upper respiratory tract infections since their acute Q fever while the above mentioned studies made no such distinction.",

The concept of trained immunity is based on metabolic and epigenetic remodeling of monocytes, macrophages, and their progenitor cells, following insults such as infection, vaccination, or inflammatory diseases (e.g. atherosclerosis) [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Epigenetic remodeling on promoter regions of pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, can result in transcriptionally active chromatin, often accompanied by higher expression of open chromatin marks such as H3K4me3 [11, 22] . Such remodeling can result in an increased inflammatory response upon a second, nonspecific, infectious stimulus. As a counterbalance of trained immunity, certain incentives are known to inflict long lasting decreased inflammatory responses, i.e. tolerance [22] [23] [24] [25] . Such a process, inflicted by a strong initial incentive, e.g. acute Q fever infection, could perhaps explain the altered cytokine responses in these QFS patients and arises from similar metabolic and epigenetic remodeling.",
