This is more than double the global average rate of 133 per 100 000.12 An estimated 1.2 million out of the 9.6 million TB cases (12%) were HIV-positive and the Africa Region accounted for 74% of them. It is important to note that in 2014, three million people with TB went undiagnosed and untreated, or unreported. A significant proportion of these were in Sub-Saharan African countries. Critical to reducing the global burden of TB and slowing down TB transmission rates is the identification and treatment of all active cases of pulmonary TB, rendering them non-infectious.13 Furthermore, those individuals with a high risk of re-activation of latent TB infection need to be identified and treated.12\n",

The number of MDR-TB cases in 2014 remained unchanged from the figure estimated in the previous year's 2013 WHO Annual TB Report. This may represent an underestimate, or could be explained by inadequate laboratory infrastructure and resources to correctly diagnose and report MDR-TB at the health facility and national levels. Whilst of the African countries, only South Africa has reported a high prevalence of MDR-TB, it is likely that all of Sub-Saharan Africa has a significant burden of unreported drug-resistant TB.",

We have also seen the resurgence of malaria, TB, and other infectious diseases, which were being brought under control.14 We have also witnessed the emergence of the devastating HIV pandemic, which has largely been responsible for the breakdown of TB control programs. Together, TB and HIV have imparted a huge toll on health services and the economies of Sub-Saharan African countries.15 The MDR-TB pandemic in particular now threatens to devastate entire regions and may fundamentally alter the life-expectancy and demographic profile of many African countries.16\n",

This book was edited by Professor Francis Omaswa and Lord Nigel Crisp, Chairman of the UK All Party Parliamentary Group on Global Health, a tireless advocate for global health and international development issues and renowned for his commitment to improving health services in Africa. It contains chapters written by three generations of African leaders, including the ex-Prime Minister of Mozambique, Dr Pascoal Mocumbi, and Rwandan Minister of Health, Dr Agnes Binagwaho, among others who have led the transformation of health services in Africa. They detail their experiences and vision for Africa health systems, emphasizing that \u201cAfrican leaders and leadership in health have an enormous role to play in a new Africa, where Africans recognize that the responsibility for making Africa an equal player in the global community rests primarily with Africans.\u201d They address key global health issues and emphasize that there are lessons that other nations can learn from Africa. In addition, they challenge Africans to take up the mantle and lead from the front. This supports the repeated calls for Africa to become independent from the dominance of research in Africa by Western institutions,36, 37, 38 and to build infrastructure and capability that can be sustained in the long term.",

EDCTP2 has substantial funding for clinical trials research, training, and capacity development on TB as one of the major poverty-related diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa.25 Three funding schemes or \u2018actions\u2019 are supported under the EDCTP2 program:38 (1) research and innovation actions (RIA), (2) coordination and support actions (CSA), and (3) training and mobility actions (TMA). RIAs are primarily clinical research activities and clinical trials conducted in partnership between European and Sub-Saharan African countries aimed at increasing the number of new or improved interventions for TB, HIV, malaria, and other poverty-related diseases. CSAs are primarily accompanying measures, such as activities to develop, strengthen, and extend clinical research capacities in Sub-Saharan Africa. They aim to maximize the public health impact of research results by promoting their translation and supporting their uptake in policy-making, health systems, and clinical practice at the local, national, regional, and international levels. TMAs are activities that foster career development (fellowships) of individual junior and senior researchers from Sub-Saharan Africa, support training and mentorship of researchers, and promote mobility of individual researchers. Between 2009 and 2014, EDCTP supported four African (South, East, West, and Central) regional networks of excellence,39 which enabled African scientific leadership to develop and address capacity development and training needs, identify gaps for tackling TB, and develop locally relevant solutions. Progress made under the first EDCTP program requires consolidation, and the research capacity built needs to be strengthened further.",

These will require evaluation in clinical trials for their impact when used as adjunct therapy, on shortening the duration of TB treatment, improving treatment outcomes of MDR-TB, and preventing pulmonary damage and functional disability.43 This will be taken forward by a recently formed Host-Directed Therapies Network consortium (HDT-NET),44 a consortium of partners from all regions of Africa in collaboration with institutions in Europe, Australia, and the USA.45\n",

Furthermore, scaling up sustainable interventions for TB care and treatment requires high-level political commitment and adequate financial and human resources.46 Central coordination under the national government's stewardship will be essential. African governments must step up current efforts to further improve the quality of proactive TB screening and identification of all missed, sub-clinical and undiagnosed cases of TB,47, 48 improve health services to provide quality TB treatment, and provide follow-up care. Efforts must also be stepped up to improve capacity for rapidly diagnosing MDR-TB to address this deadly and growing epidemic in Africa.12 We also re-iterate that it is only through the empowerment of the indigenous younger generation scientists, program managers, and healthcare workers that the current status quo can be changed significantly.",
