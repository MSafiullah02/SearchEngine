            "text": "Emerging infectious diseases are of particular concern to public health. Emergence is driven by sociocultural, environmental, and ecological factors.1 The vulnerability of people to emerging infectious diseases has been shown by the emergence of AIDS in the late 1970s, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, pandemic influenza H1N1 in 2009, and multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens, as well as the re-emergence of dengue, chikungunya, and malaria. Traditionally, effective disease surveillance is expensive and needs a formal public health network.2 Such systems are maintained by most countries, to varying degrees. Data sources, surveillance methods, analytical approaches, and factors affecting these systems are varied and have been reviewed in detail elsewhere.3, 4 Traditional, passive surveillance systems typically rely on data submitted to the relevant public health authority by physicians, laboratories, and other health-care providers; they provide information crucial to the effective functioning of health systems.5 These systems can be complex and expensive. Time and resource constraints, as well as a lack of operational knowledge of reporting systems, adversely affect the completeness of reporting,6 resulting in an incomplete account of disease emergence. Furthermore, substantial lags between an event and its notification are common; a result of late or failed reporting and the hierarchical structure of these systems.7 The average delay from receipt to dissemination of data by traditional sentinel surveillance networks is roughly 2 weeks.8\n",

Although this study did not identify a single best method, it showed the potential use of Google Flu Trends data in this manner. Zhou and coworkers65 have developed a system to predict epidemic alert levels from daily Google Trends data. Hidden Markov model-based methods predicted influenza alert levels in real-time with 97\u00b77% accuracy and provided an indication of influenza activity up to 4 weeks ahead of the release of CDC reports. In another recent study, ensemble adjustment was used to assimilate Google Flu Trends data into a humidity-driven compartmental mathematical model, enabling real-time predictions of peaks to be made more than 7 weeks in advance of their occurrence.66 Finally, using a negative binomial generalised autoregressive moving average model\u2014which included Google Flu Trends data as a secondary variable\u2014Dugas and colleagues67 predicted weekly influenza cases at a medical centre with a high degree of accuracy (83% of estimates were within seven cases).",

Additionally, they investigated the potential of incorporating Google Flu Trends data into the network as a virtual provider. Google Flu Trends was reported to have a high degree of correlation with the ILINet in Texas (R2=0\u00b777 at a 0 week lag).

They analysed the frequency of English language blog posts that contained the terms \u201cinfluenza\u201d or \u201cflu\u201d and compared these with CDC ILINet data. Correlation was r=0\u00b763 for this study and r=0\u00b755 in a subsequent study with an extended dataset.72 Microblogs (such as Twitter) were not included in these studies. Collier and coworkers73 used supervised learning to categorise expressions from Twitter messages into five influenza-related categories and correlated these expressions with CDC data for positive influenza A H1N1 tests. Correlations in this study (r=0\u00b758\u20130\u00b767) were similar to those for Corley and colleagues.\n71, 72 Chew and Eysenbach74 sorted Twitter posts containing terms related to influenza A H1N1 into groups describing \u201cpersonal experiences\u201d or \u201cconcern\u201d and compared these with H1N1 incidence rates in the USA. Correlations were r=0\u00b777 for \u201cpersonal experiences\u201d and r=0\u00b766 for \u201cconcern\u201d. These correlations are not as high as those reported for approaches based on internet search queries. However, Lampos and Cristianini75 reported correlations of up to r=0\u00b7933 for their analysis of influenza created with a supervised learning framework compared with influenza-like illnesses reported by the UK Health Protection Agency. They concluded that a supervised learning framework is a suitable method for selection of features for use in digital surveillance systems. Culotta76 reported that the accuracy of estimates could be improved by use of a document classification component; they reported correlations of up to r=0\u00b797.",

Internet-based surveillance systems circumvent the bureaucratic structure of traditional systems. Furthermore, they target a different section of the community to traditional surveillance systems. Zeng and Wagner's77 model of patient behaviour during epidemics identifies four phases in health-care seeking: recognition of symptoms, interpretation of symptoms, representation of illness, and seeking treatment. Traditional surveillance systems only source data from people seeking treatment. Internet-based surveillance systems access people from not just the final phase, but also the earlier interpretation of symptoms and representation of illness phases.48 However, internet-based surveillance systems are limited to people who seek health-related information on the internet (or proxies, such as parents or carers of sick children). Despite this limitation, they can capture many cases. Attrition during disease pathogenesis or health-seeking pathways is both high and cumulative\u2014results of a study done in rural Cambodia showed that 67% of cases of haemorrhagic fever were treated at home, rather than in a health facility; thus, a health-care-based surveillance system would miss 67% of information before it even becomes accessible.78 Systems that target points earlier in surveillance will produce more timely information. For an influenza epidemic with a 20% infection rate, 10% clinical attack rate, 2% case hospital admission rate, and 0\u00b71% symptomatic case fatality rate,79 the fraction of the population assessable by an internet-based surveillance system (7488 people per 100 000 patients) would be nearly ten-times that of a traditional system (750 people per 100 000 patients), for a population with the internet use of an average high-income country (76\u00b78%; figure 2\n).9\n",

Bias introduced by self-reporting and media-driven interest might be the biggest confounder of internet-based surveillance systems. Targeting microblogs has the potential to track, not just disease activity, but also related community concerns and perceptions.73 However, the frequency of posts on social media is generally accepted to be a function of personal experience and perception of what an individual believes their friends and followers would find interesting, rather than a true reflection of the occurrence of an event.81 Similarly, the media drive search frequency. An increase in searches for \u201cbird flu\u201d occurred in the USA between 2005 and 2006, despite no avian influenza being detected; this trend was attributed to media-driven interest about the influenza outbreak affecting Asia at the time.24 A similar occurence was reported for dengue-related searches in India in 2006; an unusually large spike in searches was attributed to news that a member of the prime minister's family had been admitted to hosptial for dengue.48 To reduce the effect of media-driven searches, the Google Dengue Trends model replaces spikes that exceed the mean of the previous 4 weeks by five SDs with an imputed value.48 Media-driven behaviour does not exclusively affect internet-based surveillance systems. On April 26, 2009, the US CDC declared a national public-health emergency in response to the emerging H1N1 pandemic; the following week was termed fear week.61 Despite state-wide viral surveillance data showing little influenza activity, emergency department patient volumes increased substantially. A similar trend occurred in a Baltimore paediatric emergency department.58 Because changes in Google Flu Trends over this period correlated with the increase in emergency department patient volumes, the investigators suggested that Google Flu Trends could have a role in planning emergency department surge capacity;58 rather than representing influenza incidence, Google Flu Trends identified public perceptions of the threat of influenza and predicted the associated increase in health-care demand.",

Internet-based surveillance systems work on the premise that disease incidence correlates with frequency of information-seeking using specific terms. Textual information can be difficult to classify and interpret83 and accuracy might be heavily affected by cultural nuances, language shifts, and use of colloquialisms or even memes. The model of Collier and coworkers73 needed a filter to reduce the effect of terms such as \u201cBieber fever\u201d (which refers to infatuation with Canadian pop musician Justin Bieber) on the keyword of interest, \u201cfever\u201d. Changes to search behaviours and information-seeking practices will affect the performance of these models;62 furthermore, such changes are unlikely to occur uniformly. The re-emergence of infectious diseases with similar clinical presentations\u2014eg, chikungunya in dengue-endemic areas\u2014also presents a difficulty.48 Models should be designed for a specific system (country or region) and be validated against reference data before they are used to guide health policy or action.

Google Flu Trends alone explained roughly 60% of influenza-associated hospital admissions in Texas; which is equivalent to the performance of an optimised sentinel network with 44 providers (R2=0\u00b763). Furthermore, Google Flu Trends outperformed the 2008 Texas ILINet which drew information from 82 providers (R2=0\u00b757). An optimised network of 82 providers outperformed Google Flu Trends (R2=0\u00b777); however, the best predictive performance was achieved by optimised hybrid networks, which allowed use of Google Flu Trends as a virtual provider. Allowing Google Flu Trends as a virtual provider in a network of 82 providers increased predictive performance by a further 12\u00b75% (R2=0\u00b790).68 These studies show potential applications of internet-based surveillance systems in bolstering traditional surveillance system capacity and guiding public health action. However, the routine integration of non-traditional, unstructured, internet-based data into existing surveillance systems will necessitate a change in the structure and rhetoric of units responsible for surveillance if it is to be effectively translated into public health action.86\n",

Future studies should not only focus on development of new detection methods nor on application of these methods to new diseases, but they should also explore ways to integrate these approaches into existing systems.55 In doing so, care must be taken to ensure that new systems add to the capacity of old ones. The potential application of internet-based surveillance systems is not restricted to surveillance. They can also be strategic instruments for resource management and allocation,58, 59 which warrants further investigation. Finally, despite the potential of internet-based surveillance systems, they have not been applied with a global focus. Strategies for surveillance of infectious diseases have been criticised for focusing too heavily on high-income countries.87 New infectious diseases emerge all over the world and their emergence is affected by many sociocultural, economic, environmental, and ecological factors.1 The international nature of emerging infectious diseases, combined with the globalisation of travel and trade, have increased the interconnectedness of all countries. Strategies to detect, monitor, and control emerging infectious diseases should recognise this change\u2014these diseases are a global concern. The potential to develop global surveillance systems for emerging infectious diseases that use internet-based data should be explored.",

These systems are appealing from a logistical, economical, and epidemiological standpoint. Internet-based systems are intuitive, adaptable, operate in almost real-time and, once established, are cheap to operate and maintain.12 Furthermore, these systems do not rely on the health-care system to provide and analyse data, or a government to disseminate information and advise the international community of emerging concerns\u2014all limitations of traditional surveillance systems. However, internet-based surveillance does not provide an alternative to traditional surveillance systems. Rather, these systems are an extension of traditional systems. The societal effect and extent of spread of infectious diseases within a community cannot be measured by any one surveillance system.43 Surveillance systems should be flexible, built with models that incorporate several means of collecting information, and integrate information from other sources to create a comprehensive understanding of and approach to addressing emerging problems.86 Furthermore, addressing emerging infectious diseases is contingent on their recognition as global, rather than regional, issues. A global response requires concerted international approaches to strengthen the capacity of emerging infectious diseases surveillance systems worldwide. Future research needs to focus on how to use internet-based surveillance systems to complement existing systems.",
