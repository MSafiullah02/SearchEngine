A diseased or stressed state may also result from exposure of indigenous wildlife to wastewater components other than sewage, such as metals, synthetic organics and disinfection by-products. Additionally, stressed populations may be at increased risk of infection and disease by microbiological agents (Daszak et al. 2001). As micro-organisms in human sewage are known to cause a number of diseases in exposed human hosts, the potential exists for introduction of disease via exposure of wildlife to sewage (Daszak et al. 2001, 2004; WHO 2003).",

Drying, anaerobic digestion and composting of sludges can all lead to further reductions (USEPA 1999), although effluent quality is highly dependent on the type of system and how well it is operated. Further BOD, TSS and pathogen reductions in the remaining liquid sewage fraction are achieved through stimulation of aerobic heterotrophic microbial oxidation of sewage organics and competitive die-off of many pathogens, typically aided by active or passive aeration (Bitton 2005; Gerardi 2004).",

These settle, or are filtered or screened, leading to further reductions in pathogen, TSS and BOD levels. Composting processes make use of a succession of largely aerobic heterotrophic micro-organisms, in which mesophilic bacteria are succeeded by thermophilic bacteria and fungi (largely streptomycetes and actinomycetes). During these processes, temperatures of 70\u00b0C may be obtained, killing many non-spore-forming pathogenic micro-organisms and reducing moisture content (Bitton 2005).",

This has largely been brought about by increased awareness of the need to protect the environmental values of Antarctica and recognition of localised adverse effects on indigenous biota, which in turn led to international agreement on the need for better environmental management in Antarctica and subsequently to obligations under the Antarctic Treaty System (Coughlin 1998; Greenpeace USA 1990). Improved practices have been made possible by the development and availability of logistically feasible, small-scale wastewater treatment technologies (Bou et al. 1996; Hughes 2004; Meyer-Rochow 1999; NSF 1990; Redvers 2000; US EPA 1992).",

For monitoring to be effective in testing predicted impacts, it is essential that it is directed towards measuring the impacts rather than simply recording the amount of treated or untreated effluent discharged. Microbiological analysis parameters comprise an important component of wastewater environmental impact monitoring schemes (APHA 2005; COMNAP 2005; EPHC/NRMMC 2005; US EPA 1992, 1999). However, microbiological monitoring of sewage discharges is not currently performed at all Antarctic stations or by tourist vessels (COMNAP 2005). Such data would be useful not only for monitoring environmental impact, but also for assessing treatment efficacy of different systems for review by all Antarctic operators. Additionally, microbiological data is essential as the basis for meaningful assessments of the risk of disease introduction to indigenous wildlife (Haas 2002; Westrell et al. 2004).",

At most stations solids are separated, often dewatered, and stored for shipment out of Antarctica for ultimate disposal. While awaiting shipment, these solids must be stored in such a way as to restrict access by indigenous fauna (Burger 1981; M\u00fcller-Schwartze et al. 1978). At some smaller stations such as Aboa (Finland) and Wasa (Sweden), urine is separated at source and the liquid fraction is evaporated or freeze-dried after settling. This latter approach is a low-energy method for reducing sewage bulk and is suitable for use at smaller stations (Sanin et al. 1994).",

The breakout of seasonal fast-ice and the scouring effects of icebergs and pack-ice make permanent submerged discharge points difficult to maintain (Bleasel et al. 1989; Holmes et al. 1983). Therefore, at some locations disposal is through pipes that terminate above sea level and effluent is discharged onto ice-cliffs (e.g. Casey), onto the shoreline above the sea-ice (e.g. Davis) or onto the sea-ice at pressure ridges and tidal cracks. Discharge above the ice in this way limits dispersion, as it must first permeate through the ice which tends to channel effluents, and may cause aesthetic and odour problems (McFeters et al. 1993; Redvers 2000.)",

The low mean temperatures at higher latitudes in Antarctica effectively rule out such systems because of freezing and logistical problems (McAnaney 1998). Open systems might be possible in the warmer, more northerly parts of the Antarctic Peninsula or on sub-Antarctic islands, but if used would create the possibility of direct access by indigenous wildlife, primarily birds (Burger 1981; M\u00fcller-Schwartze et al. 1978). Indeed, disposal of liquid or solid wastes in any manner that leaves them open to the environment increases the risk of transmission of infectious diseases to wildlife. Similarly, standard septic systems with subsurface leach fields would face problems of restricted penetration of the leachate through permafrost layers and possible channelling and pooling (US EPA 1992). Both these technologies are effectively prohibited in the Antarctic Treaty Area because of the ban on the disposal sewage onto ice-free areas included in the Madrid Protocol.",

In addition, separation of urine is desirable in composting toilets, as it provides greater control over compost moisture. Considering the low ambient temperatures at many stations, the use of ambient freezing and subsequent sublimation of solids, as well as source-separated liquids, may provide an effective alternative for reduction of sewage volume (Parker et al. 2000; Sanin et al. 1994).

Mortality of the amphipod Heterophoxus videns was high in 28-day bioassay exposures to sediments from near the McMurdo Station sewage outfall and to those from Winter Quarters Bay, compared to relatively uncontaminated sediments (Lenihan et al. 1995). Increased levels of petroleum hydrocarbons have been found in marine sediments in the vicinity of Davis Station (Green and Nichols 1995; Green et al. 1992), and increased levels of metals have been found to be centered around the sewage outfall at McMurdo Station (Anderson and Chagu\u00e9-Goff 1996).

High levels of organic material in sewage have the capacity to consume oxygen from water (termed biological oxygen demand, BOD) largely due to respiration by heterotrophic bacteria, and can be detrimental to aquatic systems by reducing dissolved oxygen to levels that are insufficient to sustain life (APHA 2005; Bitton 2005; USEPA 1992). In a study of BOD of discharged sewage at in situ temperatures (\u22121.8\u00b0C) at McMurdo Station, Howington et al. (1994) found that rates of oxygen uptake were approximately 3-fold lower than at the standard test temperature of 20\u00b0C. This suggests that while oxygen limitation in mixed receiving water columns is unlikely, oxidation rates of organic material are significantly reduced. This may result in localised acute benthic impacts caused by the high BOD creating oxygen limitation in settled solids. Both nutrient levels and BOD can be reduced by settling, and most of the more advanced treatment technologies are designed to further reduce them (Bitton 2005; Gerardi 2004; US EPA 1999).",

This is typically associated with settling and accumulation of effluent solids over existing benthic environs.

Indeed, the presence of a microbial mat of Beggiatoa sp. (a chemolithotrophic sulphur-oxidising bacterium) on top of the zone of settled solids proximal to the McMurdo Station outfall suggests a source of reduced sulphur compounds (AWWA 1999; Lenihan et al. 1990, author\u2019s (Smith) unpublished data). These compounds can prove toxic to marine invertebrates and can inhibit their growth. Mitchell and Chet (1975) found evidence of both Beggiatoa and Desulfovibrio sp. involved in the destruction of stressed corals (Platigyra sp.), while Campos et al.

The most commonly reported EDCs are estrogenic reproductive steroid hormones and biodegradation products of alkylphenol ethoxylate surfactants (APEs, common in cleaning products, shampoos, household cleaners, contraceptives, etc.) The effects of EDCs in Antarctica have been very little studied. EDCs are particularly harmful to reproductive and early development phases, and because many fish and invertebrate species reproduce and undergo early development in the nearshore marine environment in Antarctica, it is possible that they could exert detrimental impacts. If EDCs do prove to be a major concern in Antarctica, they will be difficult to address, as advanced tertiary treatments such as reverse osmosis are required to effectively remove them.",

Similarly, Palmgren et al. (2000) did not find antibiotic resistance in any of 50 Salmonella spp. isolates from Bird Island seabirds and fur seals.

Faecal sterols may be useful for distinguishing between sewage and wildlife-derived organic material. Total coprostanol/epicoprostanol ratios have been suggested for discriminating between human and marine mammal faecal contamination (Green et al. 1992), but may be limited because of the high variability of the ratio. Indeed, Venkatesan et al. (1986) suggested that sterol composition in Antarctic sediments might be different from that in temperate environments and urged caution in the specific use of coprostanol for estimation of sewage-derived organic material. Hughes and Thompson (2004) used coprostanol + epicoprostanol:coprostanol + cholestanol (5\u03b1[H]-cholenstan-3\u03b2-ol) ratios (also termed 5\u03b2:5\u03b2 + 5\u03b1 ratios) to more specifically distinguish between these faecal sources. The relationship between faecal sterols and bacterial indicators was investigated by Leeming and Nichols (1996). These authors found better correlation between levels of coprostanol and enterococci than for thermotolerant coliforms in a temperate river estuary (Tasmania, Australia). Their correlation of faecal sterol data with bacterial indicator data in this environment indicated that levels of coprostanol of 76 and 499 ng l\u22121 corresponded to 35 and 230 enterococci per 100 ml, while levels of coprostanol of 60 and 400 ng l\u22121 corresponded to 150 and 1,000 thermotolerant coliforms per 100 ml, respectively.",

Genotyping includes techniques such as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), pulsed field electrophoresis (PFGE), multi-locus restriction typing (MLRT), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), BOX-PCR fingerprinting and ribotyping, as well as enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR (ERIC-PCR), among others. Recent reviews of this rapidly advancing field include those by Olive and Bean (1999), Jannes and De Vos (2006) and others. Significant recent advances have also occurred in microbial community profiling techniques (Spiegelman et al. 2005). While isolation of identical genotypes from respective sewage populations and associated wildlife is not definitive evidence of sewage as the source of the organism, it does provide strong presumptive evidence. Supporting evidence would include significantly reduced occurrence of the genotype (or microbe) in the same animals remote from the sewage source(s). Significant recent advances in molecular genotyping techniques will allow greater application for determination of wildlife disease epidemiology in relation to sewage disposal. Indeed, application of such techniques for genotyping of bacteria isolated from Antarctic wildlife is increasing (Broman et al. 2000; Leotta et al. 2006a).",

This is not surprising considering the ongoing investigations into the considerable microbial diversity of the human gut. However, a survey of the dominant flora of selected wildlife in terms of faecal indicator bacteria (faecal enterococci, E. coli, C. perfringens), the Enterobacteriaceae, selected viral pathogens and indicators (Hepatitis A, Norovirus, somatic and male-specific (F+) coliphage) and fungi (Aspergillus sp., Candida sp.) would be of significant value as the basis for identifying possible changes to normal flora in response to sewage exposure. Indeed, knowledge of the normal enteric microbial flora of Antarctic wildlife is essential as the baseline for determining whether organisms may have been introduced by human activities (Broman et al. 2000).",

The size of localised areas of high coliform densities (>1000/100 ml) reduced significantly (Fig. 15.1) in the near-shore area when the outfall was changed from surface to subsurface discharge (5 m depth, 15 m from shore) (Howington 1992; McFeters et al. 1993). An additional ca. 10-fold reduction in coprostanol in sediments close to the outfall was observed (Edwards et al. 1998). The changes were thought to be due to better dispersion of sewage from the submerged outfall than when the outfall discharged directly onto the sea-ice. Localisation was thought to be due to restricted dispersion of sewage due to submerged shore-associated sea-ice tide cracks and pressure ridges, and tide-associated movement within these features.\n",

            "text": "In contrast to McMurdo, most other Antarctic stations have summer populations of 20\u201360 or less. Faecal indicator bacteria in marine receiving waters surrounding such stations have generally been found to be detectable for just a few hundred metres from outfalls (Bruni et al. 1997; Delille and Delille 2000; Hughes 2003). However, relocating outfalls to improve dispersion can still bring about environmental improvements. At Scott Base (NZ, population 10\u2013100) relocation of the outfall from the foreshore (13 m from the shoreline) to 5 m offshore through a tide crack in the sea-ice increased dispersion and faecal coliform (>1 CFUs per 100 ml) plume area. Increased lateral dispersion along the near shore was noted, and is associated with an area of large tide cracks and pressure ridges. Several other studies have also noted restricted dispersion when effluent is discharged directly onto the foreshore or sea-ice (Delille and Dellile 2000; Hughes 2003). A study at Rothera Station (UK, population \u223c22 in winter and up to 120 in summer) indicated presumptive faecal coliform levels > 10 CFUs per 100 ml between 300 m (February) and 500 m (September) from the outfall (Hughes 2003). This study also emphasised the effects of variations in station population on presumptive faecal coliform densities, and that these were masked by the effects of changing environmental factors such as solar radiation, the summer algal bloom and sea-ice formation.",

Increased concentrations of faecal indicators were related to increases in station population and this was attributed to the inability of the wastewater treatment system to handle the increased volume of influent. A study of faecal coliform dispersion from untreated sewage discharged from Dumont d\u2019Urville Station (France, population \u223c25\u201360) found levels < 5 CFUs per 100 ml at > 2 km from the point of discharge (Delille and Delille 2000).

Bacteria (Corynebacterium-Rothia, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Micrococcus spp.) and fungi (Cladosporium, Penicillium spp.) reported to be of human origin (but not E. coli or other standard faecal indicators) were found in soils from 68 sites up to 100 m from Syowa (Showa) Station (Japan) (Toyoda et al. 1985). Non-culturing techniques (PCR amplification) were used to demonstrate the presence of E. coli in soils at an abandoned field site (Canada Glacier camp site), but they were not detected at a currently occupied site (Lake Fryxell camp site) (Sj\u00f6ling and Cowan 2000) possibly due to improved environmental practices in recent years. Lemese and Cowan (2005) also used PCR to demonstrate the presence of Staphylococcus epidermidis in soils from heavily impacted sites in the DryValleys, but not in low-impact and pristine sites. Upton et al. (1997) used PCR to detect human commensals from soils around Halley Station (UK), but were unable to detect them using culture-based techniques. It should be emphasised that standard PCR (as opposed to reverse-transcriptase PCR) does not distinguish between viable and non-viable cells, and that viable cells are required for a microbial pathogen to infect a susceptible host. However, these results do demonstrate the environmental persistence of DNA from these organisms, and hence availability for transformation of indigenous bacteria under suitable conditions (Lorenz and Wackernagel 1994).",

Aerosols can be created via sewage treatment and discharge processes, and their subsequent dispersion has been described (Bitton 2005; Fannin et al. 1985; Shuval et al. 1989; WHO 2003). Surface discharge into surf or intertidal zones, and venting of wastewater treatment processes may be expected to generate bioaerosols. Generally, propagules of certain viruses as well as sporulated bacteria and fungi are more resistant to airborne environmental stressors (dessication, irradiation, etc.) than non-spore-forming micro-organisms. In a general study of fungal bioaerosols on Signy Island (sub-Antarctic) Marshall (1997) found concentrations of a common saprophytic fungal bioaerosol Cladosporium spp. tended to decrease with increasing latitude. Seasonal abundances were associated with the thaw, and transport from more northerly latitudes was suggested as a possible source. Using 16S rRNA PCR to analyse biodiversity of aerosols at Rothera Point (Antarctic Peninsula) Hughes et al. (2004) found that the majority of sequences obtained appeared to be of local or regional origin. These authors also noted the utility of this analytical technique over conventional microscopic morphologic or culture-based isolation/identification techniques. In a study of sewage-derived bioaerosols from an Antarctic marine discharge, Hughes (2006) found faecal coliforms up to 175 m downwind from the intertidal discharge point (which included a 1 m drop to the marine environment) and that dispersion appeared to be related to wind speed. Faecal coliform survival in relation to desiccation and UV irradiation indicated ca. 3\u20134 log10 reductions in this indicator within 1 h of exposure. However, these organisms retained viability and were deposited cumulatively under low UV irradiation when collected into a suitable growth medium. Hence, although environmental survival of non-spore-forming sewage-derived microbial bioaerosols appears limited, wildlife close to sources may be subjected to cumulative exposures.",

Several studies have suggested that enterococci (Bruni et al. 1997; Smith et al. 1994; Lisle et al. 2004) are optimal faecal indicators for water samples and C. perfringens for sediments (Edwards et al. 1998; Hughes and Thompson 2004; Lisle et al. 2004), because they are present in greater numbers and at greater distances from sewage outfalls, and may be more persistent in the Antarctic marine environment than alternative microbial indicators.",

E. coli showed a similar decline under ambient light. They concluded that as repair mechanisms are unlikely to operate in situ, resuscitation of sublethally damaged cells is improbable, and recommended that sewage should be discharged on or near the sea surface to maximise exposure to solar radiation.

Observations of lower faecal coliform counts with seasonally increasing solar radiation led this author to suggest that solar radiation dose is the dominant factor controlling concentrations of this indicator in seawater near the station. A later study demonstrated that the bactericidal effects of solar radiation on E. coli progressively increased with shorter wavelengths < 345 nm, showing a ca. 3.5 log10 reduction at 280 nm over 60 min exposure (Hughes 2005). Additionally, die-off was greater in seawater compared to phosphate buffered saline, under UVB compared to UVA or photosynthetically-active radiation (400\u2013700 nm), and in filtered sewage compared to raw, centrifuged sewage containing particulates. These results indicate the importance of solar radiation in reducing numbers of bacteria in sewage discharged into the marine environment.",

This was despite progressive relative decreases in recovery of these bacteria on selective media versus non-selective media, suggesting that these species may persist for extended periods in the Antarctic in a sub-lethally injured or viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state, particularly when shielded from solar radiation in sediments or by sea-ice cover (Smith et al. 1994). After 54 days exposure E. coli, S. typhimurium and Y. enterocolitica respiratory activity was found to be limited by nutrients rather than temperature, and these organisms had become markedly thermosensitive. These results suggest that reduced-temperature and/or reduced-selectivity resuscitation steps may increase recovery of these organisms from the Antarctic marine environment, and that counts obtained should be considered minima owing to the possibility of sub-lethal injury or VBNC responses. However, the extended persistence observed in the absence of high light levels is in contrast to the rapid mortality observed when enteric bacteria are exposed to Antarctic ambient light (Hughes 2003, 2005; Statham and McMeekin 1994).",

Hence, while the low in situ ambient temperatures in Antarctica may be expected to generally prolong microbial survival relative to more temperate regions, other factors, such as increased summer photoperiod, freeze/thaw, predation/grazing and salinity, may collectively or individually contribute to increased die-off of potential pathogens in human faecal waste and sewage.

In addition, the quantity and type of pathogens present in sewage from an Antarctic station may be different from those generated by the general population, although we are not aware of any comprehensive studies of pathogens (as opposed to faecal indicators) in wastewater from Antarctic stations that could be used to test whether this is the case. Most Antarctic programs require participants to pass a physical examination prior to deployment, which usually includes screening for signs of disease. Some diseases are more common in children than in the adult population; consequently, these diseases are likely to be under-represented as a result of the absence of children from Antarctic communities. Thus, the overall health of people at Antarctic stations may be better than average, with some diseases reduced or excluded. These factors, together with the absence of many vectors of human disease common in temperate climates, such as domestic animals and insects, suggest a lower likelihood of disease and shedding of pathogens into wastewater in station populations.",

In contrast, Shult et al. (1991) found low levels of transmission of adenovirus between personnel at McMurdo Station.

A survey of two species each of penguins and albatrosses, as well as Antarctic fur seals on Bird Island, South Georgia, in 1996 and 1998 isolated various Salmonellae species of very low genetic heterogeneity (Palmgren et al. 2000). The S. Enteritidis was thought to be introduced from land- or ship-based sewage, and migratory birds were suggested as possible sources (Olsen, et al. 1996). More recently a multi-year (2000\u20132003) study of avians at Hope Bay, Antarctic Peninsula (site of Esperanza Station), by Leotta et al.

All birds were dead at time of examination; however, this coincided with an outbreak of avian cholera. A clonal isolate of Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from cloacal and/or rectal swabs of 3 of 100 macaroni penguins, Eudyptes chrysolophus, at Bird Island in the sub-Antarctic (Broman et al. 2000).",

Several of the fur seal isolates showed identical sero-, and phage-types to known New Zealand porcine isolates. One isolate of S.

Indeed, the majority of wildlife disease literature is focused on zoonotic disease transmission to humans (Bengis et al. 2004), with some research effort directed towards transmission between animals (Daszak et al. 2004), or the impacts of environmental change on wildlife disease (Daszak et al. 2001; Williams et al. 2002).

The sampling design should include sufficient replication to account for natural variability, and to provide sufficient statistical power to identify important differences. Reference locations are an essential component of any rigorous monitoring design and are particularly important in this application because faecal indicators from non-human sources are known to occur at many locations in Antarctica well away from anthropogenic influences. Analytical techniques must be logistically feasible and suitable for use by a wide range of personnel, often with limited laboratory space. Microbiological samples have relatively short hold-times (8\u201348 h) within which analyses must be initiated. Therefore, samples cannot be routinely shipped out for analysis. Analyses should additionally minimise requirements for sub-culturing and/or confirmation of presumptive positive samples. Recent advances in defined substrate and chromogenic/fluorogenic media for the analysis of total coliforms, E. coli, Salmonella spp. enterococci and C. perfringens allow for such simplified analyses (Manafi 1996; Adcock and Saint 2001; Kinzelman et al. 2003; WHO 2003). Indeed, several studies have already used such media for enumeration of E. coli (Bruni 1992; Delille and Gleizon 2003; Lisle et al. 2004) and enterococci (Delille and Gleizon 2003) in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic marine environments.

Assessment of the risk to humans of sewage in the environment is commonly based on epidemiological models linking disease occurrence to exposure (Fleisher et al. 1998; Haas 2002; EPHC/NRMMC 2005; Pr\u00fcss 1998; WHO 2003). As specific data on the risk to wildlife from exposure to sewage is lacking, human-derived risk assessment data may be the best available starting point for this purpose. Alternatively, selected animal-derived pathogen dose\u2013response relationships may be used in conjunction with estimated indicator/pathogen ratios/correlations in order to estimate risk of disease using microbiological monitoring data (Haas 2002).",

On the other hand, the probability of detecting pathogens derived from sewage in wildlife in general may be higher in studies undertaken in more densely populated regions where much larger volumes of effluent are discharged, with a greater variety of pathogens entering the wastewater stream and a greater diversity of wildlife in the receiving environment. The development of molecular genotyping methods for identifying and tracing particular strains of disease-causing agents provides a set of useful tools for such investigations.",
