Initially, many of our colleagues were thinking on the basis of the first scant descriptions that this was just a new flu virus -nothing to worry about. However, as more and more experience is accumulating, it becomes obvious that although it is indeed a virus belonging to the flu family, this one has peculiarities which have the potential of straining some of our health care resources to the extreme.",

Since there is a limited number of high-pressure respirators, there is a risk that a growing number of patients with the most advanced critical stages of breathing problems will not get any treatment and accordingly will choke to death -despite the fact that the staff have the knowledge about how to save them. All the staff can do in that situation is to observe and give some palliative help. This is of course an extreme ethical provocation for the staff. The problems will be worse for medical doctors and registered nurses who are facing the difficult decisions in concrete situations than for nonmedical staff such as administrators. At the same time, many of their colleagues are on sick leave because they are infected with the coronavirus. Thus, with increasing numbers of patients in the corridor, there will be decreased staff.",
