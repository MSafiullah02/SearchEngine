The barrier, a plastic collar wrapped around building support posts, proved highly effective at preventing movement of adult lesser mealworms. Signi\u00decantly more lesser mealworm larvae were recovered from cardboard collar beetle traps placed below both washed and unwashed barriers than from traps placed above washed and unwashed barriers. Similarly, signi\u00decantly more adult Dermestes were recovered from traps placed below washed barriers than from above both washed and unwashed barriers. The level of \u00dfy specking on the barrier was found to have no signi\u00decant impact on the numbers of adult lesser mealworms and adult and larval Dermestes recovered either above or below barriers. Fly specking level did signi\u00decantly impact the numbers of lesser mealworm larvae recovered above the barrier. Although washed barriers provided the greatest deterrent to adult lesser mealworms, the presence of the barrier, regardless of the level of \u00dfy specking, provided a signi\u00decant deterrent to beetle climbing success. Washed barriers further reduced climbing success by lesser mealworm larvae by 17%, Dermestes adults by 7\u00d028%, and Dermestes larvae by 33\u00d038%. The high level of climbing observed by adult lesser mealworms suggests that the impact of adult beetle movement toward birds should be considered in its importance in building damage, disease transmission, feed infestation, and bird productivity and health. Observations on cost and maintenance of the barrier are discussed.",

Although the primary habitat for the beetle is in the manure or litter, the larvae climb walls and support posts in caged-layer poultry facilities seeking pupation sites and causing extensive damage to insulation materials (Vaughan et al. 1984 , Despins et al. 1987 . Vaughan et al. (1984) also observed a preponderance of adult beetles in the tunnels of the insulation; however, the damage to insulation was not directly attributed to the adult stage. Additionally, the adult stage can become a very serious pest when manure is spread on \u00deelds during warmer months. The adult beetle is capable of \u00dfight and will move en masse toward arti\u00decial lights generated by residences near \u00deelds on which beetle-infested manure has been spread.",

At each facility, barriers (PET strips) were installed using the same procedure. The PET was cut into 64-cm strips. Before installation, support posts in the facilities were measured and the PET strips were creased by hand according to the dimensions of the corresponding posts. A 1-cm bead of adhesive (Nail Pro, OSI Sealants, Inc., Mentor, OH) was applied 3 cm from the edge on the inner surface of each barrier.

After placement, the attachment of the barriers was examined and additional adhesive was applied to \u00dell in any gaps at the wood\u00d0plastic interface. In each poultry house, beetle traps, made of 81 by 15.2-cm corrugated cardboard strips (Brooder Guard, Beacon Industries, Westminster, MD), were placed for a 1-wk duration at a minimum of 3-wk intervals to determine the ef\u00decacy of the barriers.

To complete the cleaning, each barrier was again wiped down with clean water. Cardboard collars were wrapped around the post, either above or below the barrier, as described previously. The cardboard collars were af\u00dexed with the corrugated side facing out, and stapled twice where the ends overlapped. After 1 wk, the cardboard collars were removed.

In Maine, insects on the cardboard collar surface were removed and the cardboard collars were placed into sealable plastic bags.

However, during this study, we observed considerably greater movement up support posts by lesser mealworm adults compared with larvae. Indeed, adult lesser mealworm climbing behavior was so proli\u00dec that while installing barriers it was not uncommon to return to the barriers within hours of installation and \u00dend dozens of beetles on support posts directly below barriers. That manure core beetle counts documented similar levels of adult and larval lesser mealworm in the manure pile while such a large number of adults was observed climbing the support posts suggests that the impact of adult beetle movement toward rafters or even movement into the bird level of the facility should be considered in its importance in building damage, disease transmission, feed infestation, and bird productivity and health. Many studies document the impact of birds feeding on lesser mealworms and the ability of lesser mealworms to serve as vectors of a variety of pathogens to broiler chickens and turkeys Axtell 1994, 1995; McAllister et al. 1994 McAllister et al. , 1996 Goodwin and Waltman 1996) . Preventing birds from feeding on lesser mealworms in these broiler chicken and turkey facilities is nearly impossible given animal management practices where birds are always in direct contact with the litter-containing beetles. However, caged-layer facilities are very different in that birds are held well above the manure pit, creating a spatial separation of bird and insect, thereby greatly reducing this interaction. In addition, the impact of lesser mealworm adult presence on adult, egg-laying, and possibly na\u1e4fve birds has not been studied. We observed a \u03fe90% reduction in beetle presence above barriers that had not been washed and that were heavily covered with \u00dfy specks. Therefore, the barrier may prove to be a useful tool to deter large numbers of beetles from reaching rafters and birds, even if producers are unwilling or able to clean them regularly.",

            "text": "For barrier technology to be most effective, producers must be willing to wash them after house \u00dfy populations subside and most likely wash the barriers several times during the \u00dfock cycle. This is because barriers can rapidly become covered with \u00dfy specks during the typical \u00dfy outbreak that occurs after facilities are repopulated. In the larger New York facilities, this would involve \u03f7100 \u00d0150 posts. An additional challenge to the use of barriers includes the duration of manure accumulation. The longer the manure remains in the facilities, the higher and wider the pile becomes which, in turn, contributes to increased inaccessibility to the barriers for the purpose of cleaning. At a certain point, maintaining/cleaning the barriers will become cost prohibitive. It is also critical that producers understand that this technology will not decrease beetle numbers in the facility. The barrier is solely a tool for preventing damage to the structural posts and possibly protecting bird health. Although not evaluated in this study, the inner foundation of a manure pit can easily be wrapped in plastic barrier to prevent beetles from crawling up the walls and reaching building insulation. Geden and Carlson (2001) described the durability and maintenance efforts associated with the utiliza-tion of the barrier. Our estimate of the cost to install the barrier onto 100 posts include $133.00 for one roll of PET, $27.00 for 35 tubes of generic adhesive, and $400.00 for labor (26-h effort). The resultant primary installation costs totaled $560.00. The PET material is very durable and although it is likely that a number of posts will require repair after each cleanout, producers can expect several years of use after the installation of this mechanical barrier. This system provides producers with another cost-effective tool to add to their integrated pest management program.",
