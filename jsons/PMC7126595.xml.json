            "text": "ANPs play a key role in the treatment of viral infections, and this class of compounds can be regarded as one of the most significant group of drugs in the antiviral field.16, 17 Discovered almost 30 years ago, a great wealth of research has been dedicated to the development of efficient synthetic methodologies that resulted in a great variety of ANPs.18, 19, 20, 21, 22 These new structures offer a potential for the discovery of more effective drugs against a variety of infectious diseases including antiparasitic,23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 antimicrobial,30, 31, 32, 33 and antitubercolous34, 35 medicines. Among these synthetic strategies, quite recently, Agrofoglio\u2019s group has elaborated a novel, efficient and straightforward synthesis of C5-alkenyl substituted ANPs via olefin cross-metathesis.36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 Although structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on acyclic nucleosides have not clarified their pharmacophore model, the introduction of a rigid structural element such as the double bond has proved to be extremely important for their antiviral activity.43, 44 Precisely, the trans-alkene skeleton is able to mimic the three-dimensional geometry of the ribose ring maintaining also an electronic contribution similar to the one provided by the oxygen.45 There are considerable evidences that the trans-alkenyl acyclic nucleotide motif has a strong affinity with recombinant human thymidylate kinase (hTMPK) active site, responsible for the nucleotide phosphorylation and consequently correlated to its antiviral activity.41Interestingly, Agrofoglio\u2019s group employed the olefin cross-metathesis methodology also for the direct synthesis of a vast array of unsaturated ANPs analogues including bis-POM, bis-POC, and alkoxyesters prodrugs.36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 46, 47 Although adopting a different procedure, our group extended the range of prodrugs of (E)-but-2-enyl-pyrimidine, by synthesising their ProTide and bisamidate derivatives.48 In this study we showed that the ProTide technology was able to broaden the spectrum of antiviral activity when compared to other phosphate prodrug approaches. However, we discovered that this methodology suffers from the limitation that only linear olefin must be employed, as with trisubstituted alkenyl derivatives we observed only formation of traces of the desired ProTides. This finding prompted us to investigate the possibility of using the cross-metathesis for the direct synthesis of unsaturated branched ANP phosphonoamidates. At the time we started this investigation, no application of such procedure for the synthesis of ProTides was yet reported. However, during the preparation of this manuscript, a paper reporting the use of the cross metathesis for the synthesis of ProTide derivatives of linear (E)-but-2-enyl nucleoside scaffold, was published.49 The prodrugs described in this work belong to the same family of compounds previously reported by us,48 and indeed their antiviral profile was in agreement with our published results. In the present article, we would like to report an effective and improved methodology for the synthesis of allyl phosphonoamidate and their further application in olefin cross-metathesis for the synthesis of ANP ProTides. We also anticipate that our two-steps, one-pot methodology can also be applied to the synthesis of symmetrical allyl phosphonodiamidates. Compared with the recently published procedure,49 our synthetic strategy presents some advantages which we believe, merit consideration.",

This methodology was already adapted in our laboratory for the synthesis of adefovir and tenofovir phosphonoamidate prodrugs53 and more recently for the preparation of (E)-but-2-enyl pyrimidine ProTides.48 Briefly, commercial dimethyl allylphosphonate 1 was converted into the corresponding silyl ester 2, by reaction with an excess of bromotrimethylsilane (5.0 equivalents). Due to the hydrolytically instability of this ester, 2 was not isolated but immediately dissolved in a mixture of pyridine/Et3N and treated with the l-alanine isopropyl ester hydrochloride (1.0 equivalents), an excess of 1-naphthol (6.0 equivalents), and a premade solution of PPh3 (6.0 equivalents) and aldrithiol-2 (6.0 equivalents) in pyridine. After 16 h, the crude mixture did not show the presence of either the desired product or phosphonodiamidate compound (which, based on our experience, is almost invariably formed). We attributed this lack of reactivity to the decomposition of the disilyl ester 2 caused by the release of hydrobromic acid, generated by the hydrolysis of the excess of TMSBr used. Pleasingly, when we attempted the reaction in the presence of 2,6-lutidine (4.0 equivalents) as acid scavenger, the formation of the desired product 3a was observed (31P NMR and LC-MS analysis of the crude mixture). 3a was isolated by flash chromatography in excellent yield (79%) (Table 1\n, Entry 1). Quite surprisingly, no evidence of side reactions48 (bromination of the double bond and formation of the phosphonodiamidate) have been observed.",

First we employed the same CM conditions developed and used by Agrofoglio for the synthesis of the corresponding bis-POM alkenyl derivatives38. As expected we obtained a mixture of E/Z isomers of which the desired compound E-8a was afforded in 24% yield (Entry 1, Table 2\n). Both E-8a and Z-8a isomers were isolated by preparative reverse phase-HPLC and their configurations were confirmed by NOESY experiments. The homodimer 9 was formed along with the E/Z derivatives. Any attempt to improve the reaction outcome using different catalysts (Hoveyda-Grubbs 2nd generation catalyst (A), Grubbs 2nd generation catalyst (B) and Grubbs catalyst C859 (C) failed providing 8a in similar or lower yield and almost identical E/Z ratio (Entries 2\u20133, Table 2). Since catalyst A resulted the best in terms of product/ homodimer ratio further screening was conducted keeping A as catalyst. Prolonged reaction time (Entry 4, Table 2) resulted in a slightly increased yield that however, was not further improved with addition of more catalyst (Entry 5, Table 2,). These conditions are different from those reported by Agrofoglio in his recent paper,49 where (E)-but-2-enyl pyrimidine ProTides were formed via cross metathesis only when water was used as solvent.",

Our methodology is an important improvement of a recently reported strategy49 that allows the synthesis of these substrate in a shorter synthetic sequence and with an overall higher yield. We also extended this protocol to the synthesis of hitherto unknown allyl phosphonodiamidate. We also proved that both synthons are capable to undergo alkene cross-metathesis with alkenyl functionalized uracil and thymine nucleobases although the yields need to be further optimized, especially in the case of phosphonodiamidates. These phosphonoamidate prodrugs were evaluated for their biological activity against a panel of DNA and RNA viruses. None of the compounds prepared, showed significant cytotoxicity. ProTides of allylphosphonate pyrimidine showed a broader antiviral activity than the corresponding bis-POM prodrugs against VZV infected cells. We have also demonstrated, once again, that the introduction of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1-naphthyl moiety into the ProTide scaffold is capable to increase the antiviral activity of the prodrug. Finally, not only the E-isomers showed some biological activity, but also all the Z isomers isolated (Z-8a,e,f and Z-10e) showed to some extent antiviral activity against both AD-169 and Davis HCMV strains. Further studies directed to the optimization of the cross metathesis procedure especially for the allyl phosphonoamidate, are currently in progress in our laboratory.",
