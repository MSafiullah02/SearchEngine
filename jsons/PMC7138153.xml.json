Interestingly, six (75%) of these eight patients were children. In addition, the families of these children showed negative results in all types of specimens. More interestingly, besides these patients, a boy showed a positive result in his stool 3 weeks after close contact with his father, a confirmed patient. However, all other samples (i.e., nasal swab, throat swab, and stool) of the boy had been negative for the past 3 weeks. These findings indicate that the stool specimens of children remain positive for a longer time than those of adults. In the present work, we analyzed possible reasons behind this phenomenon.",

Of these CoVs, two zoonotic viruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, were responsible for serious outbreaks in China in 2002\u20132003 (SARS-CoV) and in the Middle East in 2012 (MERS-CoV). The 2019-nCoV virus is closely related to SARS-CoV with over 85% identity.2 Moreover, the epidemiological and biological characteristics of these viruses are relatively similar. When SARS broke out in China, researchers found that the virus could survive in feces for over 96 h.3 Similarly, studies on SARS-CoV-2 revealed that live viral strains could be isolated from feces, thus indicating the potential infectiousness of this body waste.4 Further research found that different specimens express different results at different stages of the disease. For example, a report indicated that specimens obtained from the respiratory tract are more likely to yield viral RNA in the early stages of illness than other specimens. However, this likelihood gradually decreased after the first week of onset. The same report further found that stool specimens are 100% positive on the third week after onset and 30% positive 29 days later.5 Recent data from China revealed that sputum shows the highest positive RT-PCR rates. Viral nucleic acids could be positively detected in 10% of the patients' blood samples at the acute period and in 50% of the patients' feces.4 These studies infer that live viruses and viral nucleic acids could be detected in stool. Moreover, compared with respiratory specimens, stool specimens may remain positive longer, similar to the findings of the present study.",

Interestingly, subsequent findings indicated that 2019-nCoV also uses ACE2 as an entry receptor.6 Previous studies demonstrated that ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lungs and small intestine7 and, especially, in proximal and distal enterocytes. Animal studies have also shown that ACE2 has different distributions in the lung in different genders and ages and that ACE2 expression in rat lung decreases with age.8 Therefore, we believe that the expression of ACE2 in the intestine of children may differ from that of adults; this difference may explain why children have a longer viral shedding period than adults.",
