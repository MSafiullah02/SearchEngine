The CDC's decision to present the racial/ethnic distribution of COVID-19 deaths at the state level alongside the weighted racial/ethnic distribution of the counties within each state reporting those deaths-in effect, a geographic adjustment-makes it seem that Whites have the highest death rates. Age adjustment procedures used by others, including the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, lead to the opposite conclusion that Blacks and Hispanics are dying from COVID-19 at higher rates than Whites. In this paper, we use indirect standardization methods to adjust per capita death rates for both age and geography simultaneously, avoiding the one-sided adjustment procedures currently in use. Using CDC data, we find age-and-place-adjusted COVID-19 death rates are 80% higher for Blacks and over 50% higher for Hispanics, relative to Whites, on a national level. State-specific estimates show wide variation in mortality disparities. Comparison with nonepidemic mortality reveals potential roles for preexisting health disparities and differential rates of infection and care.",

However, as previously discussed, these disparities in unadjusted crude death rates are confounded by differences in age structure and the geographically localized nature of the early stages of the epidemic. Accounting for the county-level geography of COVID-19 mortality reduces disparities for Blacks to about half of the level of the per capita rates (56% to 24%), as can be seen in the \"Place Standardized\" portion of the figure. Place standardization also reduces the relative death rate for Hispanics slightly and Asians substantially.

Standardization is typically used to remove the effects of \"'extraneous' influences\" [14, p. 24 ]. While it is clear that we should be comparing individuals of like ages, it is not so clear that place of residence is a purely \"extraneous\" influence, particularly given the long history of racial discrimination in housing [13] .

Understanding the reasons for this pattern is an important topic for future research. This paper offers a method for more refined measurement of racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 mortality using limited data. Indirect standardization is a powerful tool that can be widely adopted for the reporting of mortality that adjusts for both age and place. We believe this approach is superior to the one-sided adjustment procedures currently in use by state and local agencies as well as at the federal level at the CDC.",
