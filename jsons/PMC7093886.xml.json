Bilateral disease, multilobar shadows, and the presence of pleural effusion on initial chest radiographs are predictive of adverse outcomes in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (16, 17, 18). The initial radiographic features of patients with SARS have been described (6, 19, 20). Our present study of the predictive value of initial chest radiography adds to these earlier studies. We observed that patients with more extensive lung involvement in terms of bilateral disease and more than two zones of involvement had more systemic disease and worse outcomes. Patients with involvement of more than two zones had a higher risk of liver impairment and more severe lymphopenia, which may reflect systemic viral infection. A recent study reported that patients requiring intensive care had higher serum SARS coronavirus concentrations as detected by RT-PCR (21). This new assay, however, is not widely available, and its correlation with radiographic abnormalities is not known. We also found higher lactate dehydrogenase levels and neutrophil counts in patients with greater lung involvement, which suggests that greater lung damage may occur in patients with extensive lung infiltrate on chest radiographs (7).",

However, multilobar change was not identified as an independent prognostic factor in their study, perhaps because their sample size was too small and their use of a single frontal chest radiograph was not adequate in defining the number of lobes involved. Other reports did not consider initial radiographic abnormalities as a confounding factor for clinical outcome (7, 20). As there were correlations between chest radiographic findings and other confounding factors, we used multivariate analysis with logistic regression to determine the independent prognostic value of chest radiograph on presentation and found that involvement of more than two zones was independently associated with an adverse outcome.",

In our study, the interobserver agreement on the normality, laterality, and number of zones was generally good. Complete concordance among the radiologists was greater than 80%, which is considered acceptable. It may be argued that quantitative assessment of the total area of infiltrate rather than the number of zones involved may be a more accurate indicator of disease severity. Area estimation, however, is highly subjective and may result in substantial interobserver variability. On the other hand, the level of agreement on assessment of type and distribution of opacification appeared unsatisfactory by the \u03ba statistic.",

            "text": "SARS is a highly contagious infectious disease that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Patients\u2019 conditions may deteriorate rapidly with acute respiratory failure. Indeed, 23% to 48% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation (1, 6, 7), and short-term mortality rates range from 4% to 15% (7, 23). Our study suggests that radiographic evidence, specifically, frontal chest radiograph on presentation, may have prognostic value in patients with SARS. Patients with more extensive lung involvement on the initial chest radiograph had a higher risk of mechanical ventilation or death. Involvement of more than two zones on initial chest film, older age, and shortness of breath on presentation were independent predictors of an adverse outcome.",
