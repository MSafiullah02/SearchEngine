About twenty clinical cases have been reported in the literature, sometimes described only briefly with regard to both the clinical course and the therapy employed. Because of this, we wish to describe the clinical findings of four cases of feline leishmaniasis observed between December 1997 and May 2001.",

The cats were six (case 3), 10 (case 4) and 14 (case 1) years of age, in case 2 the age was unknown but the subject was an adult cat. All cats came from the Messina district and they were free-roaming. Diagnosis was achieved by microscopic (smears from cutaneous ulcers and cysts, and from lymph node needle-aspiration) and serological investigations (IFAT) with anti-L eishmania antibody titres ranging from 640 (cases 1, 2, and 4) to 1280 (case 3). Further confirmation came from PCR and isolation of L eishmania spp. in cases 2, 3 and 4. The cats were tested for FIV and FeLV (Duospeed, BVT, La Seyne sur Mer, France), T oxoplasma gondii (IFAT), Bartonella henselae (IFAT) and given blood tests (complete blood cell count, biochemistry profile, serum protein electrophoresis, urinalysis). Two cats did not undergo specific treatment (cases 1 and 3) because the owner was not compliant with the drug regimen. Cases 2 and 4 were treated by oral administration. Case 2 was given three different oral treatments without any success: fluconazole (5 mg/kg SID for 2 months), metronidazole (25 mg/kg) and spiramycin (150,000 UI/kg) SID for 35 days and itraconazole (50 mg SID) for 2 months.",

Case 3 (no therapy), which developed urinary signs of renal failure three years later, was healthy for about two more years, when the onset of a proliferative stomatitis led to anorexia; at the same time there was the onset of seizures and an irregular bradycardia (108 beats/minute) associated with a 5th degree heart murmur.",

The drug regimen was modified and the cat was given allopurinol for ten further months. At the end of the treatment (15 months in all) L eishmania serology and PCR were negative, while neutropenia and hypergammaglobulinemia were still present. Two months later the cat exhibited anaemia, leucopenia, hypergammaglobulinemia and positive antibody (titre 80) once again. In the following months the uveitis recurred, anaemia worsened and the IFA titre rose to 1280. Parasites were isolated once again from the submandibular lymph node. At this time allopurinol (20 mg/kg SID) was recommenced, and the treatment remains ongoing.",

Clinical signs of feline leishmaniasis are quite similar to those observed for dogs: lymph node enlargement, cutaneous ulcers, alopecia, weight loss, pale mucous membranes, hypergammaglobulinemia and CRF. On the contrary, cutaneous bloody cysts (with evidence of amastigotes inside) have not been reported for canine leishmaniasis. The ocular lesions cannot be considered specific because of the concurrent FIV infection (cases 1, 3 and 4) and a high anti-T oxoplasma titre (case 4). Despite the fact that the literature reports the efficacy of fluconazole (Gangneux et al., 1999 ), itraconazole (Gangneux et al., 1999 and spiramycin+metronidazole (Gangneux et al., 1999; Pennisi et al., 2001) , these drugs did not work for the FIV\u2212 cat (case 2) which developed CRF. The same happened in case 3 which, in spite of the FIV infection and the lack of therapy, lived for five more years after diagnosis.",
