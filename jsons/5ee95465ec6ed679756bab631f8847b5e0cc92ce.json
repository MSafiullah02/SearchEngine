            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection is associated with a high case-fatality rate, and the potential pandemic spread of the virus is a public health concern. The spike protein of MERS-CoV (MERS-S) facilitates viral entry into host cells, which depends on activation of MERS-S by cellular proteases. Proteolytic activation of MERS-S during viral uptake into target cells has been demonstrated. However, it is unclear whether MERS-S is also cleaved during S protein synthesis in infected cells and whether cleavage is required for MERS-CoV infectivity. Here, we show that MERS-S is processed by proprotein convertases in MERS-S-transfected and MERS-CoV-infected cells and that several RXXR motifs located at the border between the surface and transmembrane subunit of MERS-S are required for efficient proteolysis. However, blockade of proprotein convertases did not impact MERS-S-dependent transduction of target cells expressing high amounts of the viral receptor, DPP4, and did not modulate MERS-CoV infectivity. These results show that MERS-S is a substrate for proprotein convertases and demonstrate that processing by these enzymes is dispensable for S protein activation. Efforts to inhibit MERS-CoV infection by targeting host cell proteases should therefore focus on enzymes that process MERS-S during viral uptake into target cells.",

The virus was transmitted from bats, potentially via intermediate hosts, to humans, demonstrating that the zoonotic transmission of novel coronaviruses from animal reservoirs to humans can pose a significant threat to public health [3, 4] . A similar outbreak scenario unfolded in 2012, when a novel coronavirus, initially named human coronavirus EMC and now termed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was detected in a patient from Jordan hospitalized with a severe and ultimately fatal pneumonia [5] . Subsequently, the virus spread within the Middle East and, through travel activity, occasionally to Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America [6] [7] [8] [9] . The outbreak has, as of 4 July 2014, entailed 827 laboratory-confirmed infections and 287 deaths [10] , and adaptation of the virus to moreefficient human-to-human spread is a public health concern. Therefore, it is imperative to identify and explore novel targets for antiviral therapy.",

For this, the MERS-CoV spike protein (MERS-S) binds to its receptor dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP4, CD26) on the surface of target cells [13] and drives fusion of the viral envelope with a target cell membrane, which allows delivery of viral proteins and RNA into the host cell cytoplasm, the site of viral replication. However, MERS-S and other coronavirus S proteins are synthesized as inactive precursors in infected cells and only acquire the ability to drive membrane fusion upon processing into the surface unit (S1) and the transmembrane unit (S2) by host cell proteases [14, 15] . The activity of the responsible proteases is essential for viral infectivity, which makes these enzymes potential targets for antiviral intervention.",

Similar effects were seen when potential cleavage sites 3 and 4 were simultaneously altered (PCM3 + PCM4) or when all 3 potential cleavage sites were mutated in parallel Figure 2 . RXXR motifs located at the border between S1 and S2 are required for efficient processing of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein (MERS-S). A, The domain organization of the MERS-S protein is schematically depicted. The MERS-S sequence at the border between the S1 and S2 subunits is shown. RXXR motifs, which constitute potential cleavage sites, are highlighted, and the predicted start of the S2 subunit is underlined. The mutations introduced into the potential cleavage sites in MERS-S are shown. B, 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids coding for MERS-S wild type and the indicated MERS-S mutants equipped with a C-terminal V5 tag. Transfection of empty plasmid (pcDNA) served as negative control. Expression of S proteins in cell lysates was determined by Western blot, using a V5 tag-specific monoclonal antibody. Expression of \u03b2-actin in cell lysates was assessed as a loading control. The results shown are representative for at least 3 independent experiments. Abbreviations: CT, cytoplasmic tail; PCM, potential cleavage site mutant; RBD, receptor binding domain; SP, signal peptide; TM, transmembrane domain. (PCM1 + PCM3 + PCM4). Collectively, these results indicate that MERS-S cleavage is reduced or altered upon mutation of potential cleavage sites 1, 3, and 4.",

For this, we investigated whether S protein cleavage can be blocked by a cell-permeable tripeptide derivative containing an Arg-X-Arg motive, which is known to inhibit several proprotein convertases, including furin [31] . Treatment with this PCI reduced the production of the 90-kDa band in cells transfected to express MERS-S ( Figure 3) . Moreover, the presence of PCI diminished processing of the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) into GP1 and GP2 (Figure 3) , which depends on the activity of the proprotein convertase furin [32] . In contrast, processing of the glycoprotein of Lassa virus (LASV-GPC), which is mediated by the proprotein convertase SKI-1/S1P [33] , was not suppressed (Figure 3 ). This finding is in keeping with the known differences in substrate specificity (and thus inhibitor sensitivity) of SKI-I/SIP, compared with proprotein convertases with specificity for basic amino acids, like furin [34] . Collectively, these results show that the activity of proprotein convertases is essential for MERS-S processing in transfected cells.",

For this, we used a previously described assay [24] , which is based on directed expression of S protein and receptor/protease in effector and target 293T cells, respectively. Expression of MERS-S in effector cells allowed inefficient fusion with control-transfected 293T target cells, which are known to express low amounts of endogenous DPP4 [35] , and the efficiency of cell-cell fusion was markedly increased when target cells were transfected with DPP4 and/or TMPRSS2 encoding plasmid ( Figure 4A ). However, the continuous presence of PCI in target and effector cell cultures, before, during, and after mixing had no appreciable effect on fusion efficiency ( Figure 4A ), suggesting that proprotein convertase activity is dispensable for MERS-S-driven cell-cell fusion. To determine whether proprotein convertase activity is required for MERS-S-dependent virus-cell fusion, we used a previously reported vector system [14] . Notably, the addition of PCI to cells producing MERS-S-harboring lentiviral particles reduced transduction of 293T target cells by roughly 100-fold ( Figure 4B ). In contrast, infectivity of particles bearing LASV-GPC or EBOV-GP was not affected (Figure 4B ), in keeping with the findings that processing of LASV-GPC is not inhibited by PCI (Figure 3 ) and that processing of EBOV-GP by proprotein convertases is dispensable for GP-driven virus-cell fusion [36, 37] . Of note, no inhibitory effect was detected when 293T cells transfected to express DPP4 were chosen as targets (Figure 4B) , indicating that S protein processing in virus-producing cells might be dispensable for infectivity when target cells express robust amounts of DPP4. In sum, these results suggest that proprotein convertase activity is largely dispensable for MERS-S-driven cell-cell and virus-cell fusion, at least when target cells produce high levels of DPP4.",

Therefore, we assessed whether PCI inhibits MERS-CoV spread in target cells expressing endogenous DPP4. PCI treatment of Caco-2 and Vero B4 cells infected with MERS-CoV did not inhibit total MERS-S expression but reduced S protein cleavage efficiently and in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 5A and data not shown), confirming that MERS-S is a substrate of proprotein convertases in infected cells. However, PCI treatment did not reduce MERS-CoV propagation, as determined by the amount of viral RNA ( Figure 5B and data not shown) or infectious units ( Figure 5B and data not shown) present in culture supernatants. Similarly, treatment of MERS-CoV-infected cultures had little if any effect on the formation of cytopathic effects, as demonstrated by comparable destruction of the cell monolayer ( Figure 5C ). Thus, processing of MERS-S by proprotein convertases is dispensable for MERS-CoV infectivity in cell cultures. ",

However, TMPRSS2 might not be the only cellular protease that constitutes a potential therapeutic target in the context of coronavirus infection. Thus, cleavage of MERS-S during biogenesis in infected cells might be required for subsequent cleavage and activation of the S protein by TMPRSS2 during viral uptake into target cells. Such a scenario would not be unprecedented, given that entry mediated by the glycoproteins of certain bunyaviruses depends on glycoprotein processing during synthesis in the constitutive secretory pathway and, as suggested by a recent report, during viral uptake into target cells [42] . Alternatively, it is conceivable that processing of MERS-S in infected cells is dispensable for virus-cell but required for cell-cell fusion, which results in formation of syncytia, a feature of MERS-CoV pathogenesis [5] .",

The finding that MERS-S is efficiently cleaved in transfected or MERS-CoV-infected cells is in keeping with several studies examining MERS-S expression for other purposes [16, 43, 44] . One report showed that MERS-S is not cleaved in transfected cells [17] ; however, a MERS-S variant with a truncated cytoplasmic tail was examined, and it is conceivable that this deletion interfered with S protein exposure to or recognition by proprotein convertases. Alternatively, the cells used for S protein expression might have produced only low amounts of proprotein convertases. Robust S protein processing by proprotein convertases has also been reported for mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 [45, 46] and IBV [18, 47] , while cleavage of SARS-S by these proteases is inefficient [48] [49] [50] . Thus, MERS-S belongs to the subgroup of coronavirus S proteins that are substrates of proprotein convertases, and MERS-S processing in different cellular systems, including the colon-derived cell line Caco-2, is robust.",

The finding that RXXR motifs located at the predicted border between S1 and S2 subunit are important for MERS-S processing by proprotein convertases might therefore not be unexpected. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that at least 2 RXXR motifs had to be mutated in parallel to markedly reduce S protein processing. This suggests that the processing enzyme(s) can recognize >1 cleavage site. Indeed, the S2 fragment produced upon cleavage of PCM4 showed a slightly increased molecular weight relative to the fragment generated from MERS-S wild type, which would be in keeping with use of an upstream cleavage site, most likely potential cleavage site 3. Alternatively, the integrity of the RXXR motifs located at the border of the S1 and S2 subunit might be required to present a single cleavage site in a protease sensitive configuration.",

In contrast, proprotein convertase activity is required for full activity of certain MHV and IBV S proteins in cell-cell and virus-cell fusion reactions [18, [45] [46] [47] . Moreover, processing of the HIV envelope protein by proprotein convertases is essential for viral infectivity, and it has been suggested that processing of SARS-S, although being inefficient, is still required for full viral spread and for the establishment of cytopathic effects in infected cultures [48] . The present study provides evidence that efficient blockade of MERS-S processing by PCI has no appreciable effects on S protein activity in cell-cell fusion assay and does not modulate MERS-CoV spread in susceptible cells. In contrast, inhibition of MERS-S processing markedly reduced MERS-S-driven fusion of virions with 293 T cells expressing low amounts of endogenous DPP4. It is therefore conceivable that processing of MERS-S by proprotein convertases is required for optimal spread of MERS-CoV in target cells expressing low levels of DPP4. Such a scenario would be in keeping with the observation that inefficient SARS-S-driven cell-cell fusion due to limited receptor expression can be rescued by directed expression of S protein-activating proteases and vice versa [50] .",

A, Fusion of 293T effector cells transfected to express MERS-S with target cells transfected to express DPP4 and/or TMPRSS2 or control transfected with empty plasmid ( pcDNA) was assessed. Both effector and target cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M of proprotein convertase inhibitor (PCI) as indicated and, 1 day later, were mixed for cocultivation. The effector/target cell mixtures were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or PCI, and cell-cell fusion was quantified by determination of luciferase activities in cell lysates. The results of a representative experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown. Error bars indicate standard deviation (SD). Two separate experiments yielded similar results. B, Lentiviral pseudotypes carrying MERS-S, Lassa virus glycoprotein (LASV-GPC), Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein (EBOV-GP), or the glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G), as well as pseudotypes bearing no viral glycoprotein ( pcDNA), were generated in the presence or absence of PCI (1 \u00b5M). Subsequently, target 293T cells transfected with empty plasmid or DPP4 expression plasmid were preincubated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), PBS, or PCI at a final concentration of 0.5 \u00b5M for 30-60 minutes, followed by transduction with the pseudotypes specified above. At 72 hours after transduction, luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured. The average of 5-7 independent experiments performed with triplicate samples is shown. Transduction with pseudotypes bearing VSV-G in the absence of inhibitor was set as 100%. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean (SEM).
