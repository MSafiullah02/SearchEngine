At most institutions, formal exposure to neurosurgery during medical school is weighted towards the senior years, and it is often the responsibility of the student to explore the field during earlier years 2, 3 . Due to this absence of clinical exposure, medical students' perceptions of the field, often shrouded in stereotypes, weigh heavily on the decision-making process and have been the subject of recent studies 4, 5 . However, as might be expected, student perceptions are not static and are significantly shaped by increased exposure to the field, particularly after rotating through neurosurgery electives 6 and gaining increased experience in the neurosurgical operating room (OR) 7 .",

The most cited interventions were virtual mentorship pairings and virtual skills workshops. Some efforts are underway to meet these requests at our own institution, which will be offering virtual simulation training and webinars in neurosurgical anatomy. Another Guadix 14 example is the AANS mentorship program, in which student members can match with mentors based on their needs and interests. This program is especially valuable for first and second year students who have yet to find mentors in neurosurgery. In addition, increasing numbers of presentation-based webinars are also being offered by neurosurgical organizations. Finally, as indicated by many in our survey, medical students have been hopeful for a consensus statement from neurosurgical organizations on how some of these specific changes will affect students in their residency application process. The Society of Neurological Surgeons (SNS) recently released a statement cancelling all away neurosurgery rotations. Similar communications from organized neurosurgery on other aspects of the path to residency will deepen trust with students and offer much needed guidance. Above all, the results of our study highlight the uncertainty that medical students interested in neurosurgery are still facing during this time.",
