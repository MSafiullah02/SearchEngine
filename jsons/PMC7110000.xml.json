TGF-\u03b2s are synthesized via inactive precursors, which cannot bind to their receptors until being activated. After released from cells, they associate with latency-associated protein (LAP) and form a small inactive complex. In the extracellular matrix, this complex is bound by latent TGF-\u03b2-binding protein (LTBP), a component of the extracellular matrix that is necessary for the secretion and storage of TGF-\u03b2 [3].

ALK5 (T\u03b2RI) and T\u03b2RII are specific for TGF-\u03b2. Upon TGF-\u03b2 binding, ALK5 is phosphorylated and activated by the constitutively active T\u03b2RII at the GS region, which is important for the activation of its kinase domain as well as the recruitment of R-Smads. The phosphorylation of R-Smads at the C-terminal SSXS motif by activated type I receptor is an essential step for signal transduction. Of these R-Smads, Smad2 and 3 are engaged in signal transduction of TGF-\u03b2, activin, and Nodal group cytokines, whereas Smad1, 5, and 8 are necessary for the other groups including BMPs and GDFs. Once activated, R-Smads form complexes with a common Smad (Co-Smad, Smad4), enter the nucleus and regulate transcription of target genes along with different cofactors [6]. Both R-Smads and Smad4 are characterized by two conserved regions known as MH1 domain at the N-terminus and MH2 domain at the C-terminus, respectively, which are joined together by a linker region. The MH1 domain of R-Smads and Smad4 plays important roles in cytoplasmic anchoring, nuclear import, DNA binding, and regulation of gene transcription, while the MH2 domain is responsible for Smad\u2013receptor interaction, Smad hetero-complex formation, cytoplasmic anchoring as well as transactivation of target genes [7].",

            "text": "Besides the canonical Smad-mediated signaling pathway (Fig. 1), it has long been recognized that TGF-\u03b2 can also regulate some cellular or physiological processes independent of Smad proteins. There is evidence showing that Smad4 is not indispensable for the development of the mammary gland, liver, or pancreas in mice [2,8]. We have demonstrated that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus can bind to Smad3, interfere with the complex formation between Smad3 and Smad4, and promote Smad3\u2013p300 complex formation in the nucleus [9], indicating a novel mode of Smad3 effect in a Smad4-independent manner. TIF1\u03b3 is also found to selectively associate with phosphorylated Smad2/3 in hematopoietic, mesenchymal, and epithelial cells in response to TGF-\u03b2 and transduce the signal independent of Smad4 to promote erythrogenesis [10]. In addition, TGF-\u03b2 can also activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) (ERK1/2, JNK, p38), PI3K, protein phosphatase 2A, Rho family proteins as well as the epithelial polarity protein Par6, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Lee et al. [11] reported that upon TGF-\u03b2 stimulation, activated TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2RI) recruits and directly phosphorylates ShcA protein on tyrosine and serine residues, activating ERK MAPK signaling pathway. Recently, the ubiquitin E3 ligase TRAF6 has also been reported to interact with T\u03b2RI, and this interaction is required for TGF-\u03b2-induced auto-ubiquitination of TRAF6 as well as subsequent activation of TAK1-p38 MAPK, which leads to apoptosis [12,13]. This plasticity of TGF-\u03b2 signaling allows TGF-\u03b2 to exert pleiotropic influences.",

            "text": "As mentioned above, TGF-\u03b2 is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates embryonic development and cellular homeostasis mainly through the canonical Smad-mediated signaling pathway, which appears to be relatively simple and consists of only a few essential components. However, the signal transduction is finely regulated both temporally and spatially at different levels, including ligand activation, receptor complex formation, R-Smads activation, and translocation, as well as transcription in the nucleus. Many proteins have been identified to be associated with the receptors, R-Smads, or Co-Smad, and regulate TGF-\u03b2 family signaling either in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. In addition to R-Smads and Co-Smad, there is a third Smad protein family, namely the I-Smads (Smad6 and Smad7), which have been documented to play key roles in regulating signal transduction of TGF-\u03b2 family cytokines. I-Smads are transcriptionally induced by TGF-\u03b2 family cytokines and regulate these signaling pathways negatively, thus establishing an important negative feedback loop. Of these two I-Smads, Smad7 is a general antagonist of TGF-\u03b2 family, while Smad6 is specific for BMP signaling. Smad6 and Smad7 also have conserved the C-terminal MH2 domain, but unlike R-Smads or Co-Smad, they lack the N-terminal MH1 domain and the phosphorylation site by the type I receptors at the C-terminal tail. The N-terminus of these two I-Smads shares a similarity of only 36.7%. Both the N-terminus and MH2 domain of Smad7 are essential for its specific inhibition of TGF-\u03b2/activin signaling [14,15]. I-Smads can also bind to DNA. For instance, we recently demonstrated that Smad7 could function in the nucleus by binding to the DNA elements containing the minimal Smad-binding element (SBE) CAGA box. By single-molecule force spectroscopy, our results revealed that Smad7 had similar binding strength to the oligonucleotides corresponding to the CAGA-containing activin responsive element (ARE) and the PAI-1 promoter, as that of Smad4 although, unlike R-Smad or Co-Smad, Smad7 also exhibits a binding activity to the mutant ARE with the CAGA sequence substituted. Interestingly, distinct from other Smad proteins, the MH2 domain, but not the N-terminal region, of Smad7 is responsible for DNA binding [16,17].",

            "text": "I-Smads can antagonize TGF-\u03b2 family signaling through various mechanisms (Fig. 2). First, Smad7 is shown to form a stable complex with type I receptors, therefore leading to inhibition of R-Smad phosphorylation and the hetero-complex formation between R-Smads and Co-Smad [18]. Smad7 also recruits the HECT type of E3 ubiquitin ligases, Smurf1 and Smurf2. It binds to Smurfs in the nucleus and translocates into the cytoplasm in response to TGF-\u03b2 and recruits the ubiquitin ligases to the activated type I receptor ALK5/T\u03b2RI, leading to the degradation of the receptor through the proteasomal pathway. Smad7 itself is also degraded in this process. Besides, the E3 ligases Nedd4-2 and WWP1/Tiul1 can also promote the degradation of type I receptor as well as R-Smads and Smad4, in which process Smad7 serves as an adaptor protein [19]. By employing similar mechanism, Smad6 interferes with BMP signaling. Moreover, Shi et al. [20] reported that the phosphatase GADD34-PP1c could be recruited to ALK5/T\u03b2RI by Smad7 and in turn dephosphorylate the receptor. Protein phosphatase 1\u03b1 was also reported to have similar effect to dephosphorylate ALK1 in endothelial cells. It could be recruited by Smad7 to ALK1, and thereby controlled TGF-\u03b2/ALK1-induced Smad1/5 activation [21]. In addition, Smad6 has been shown to bind to the phosphorylated Smad1 in competition with Smad4 [22].",

Recently, we reported that in some cell lines, such as Hep3B, HeLa, mink lung epithelial Mv1Lu mutant L17, and human normal lung epithelial HPL-1 cells, most Smad7 proteins retain in the nucleus even under TGF-\u03b2 stimulation, and Smad7 can exert its inhibitory effect on TGF-\u03b2 signaling in the nucleus [16]. Forced expression of Smad7 in the nucleus potently repressed the transcriptional activity of TGF-\u03b2, and the inhibitory effect of Smad7 can be independent of T\u03b2RI, as demonstrated in T\u03b2RI-deficient R1B/L17 cells. Furthermore, Smad7 is able to bind DNA in vivo and in vitro with the MH2 domain and disrupt the formation of functional Smad\u2013DNA complexes [16,17].",

AP1 and SP1 were also found to promote the transcription of Smad7, indicating that other signaling pathways may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of Smad7 (Fig. 2) [43]. Similarly, Smad6 is also transcriptionally induced by BMP/Smad signaling pathway. Besides CREB, other factors, such as OAZ and Runx2, also upregulate the expression of Smad6 [44,45].

It induces the Smad3-dependent transcription of fibrillar collagens, inhibits the degradation of ECM by downregulating the expression of matrix degrading enzymes, and increases the expression of metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors, together leading to the accumulation of ECM. Elevated TGF-\u03b2 level and decreased Smad7 level are often present in tissues where an uncontrolled fibrotic response occurs. Therefore, inhibition of Smad3 by overexpression of Smad7 dramatically reduced fibrotic responses of the kidney, lung and liver in animal models, indicating an important anti-fibrotic effect of Smad7 by antagonizing TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 signaling pathway [61\u201364].",

            "text": "In addition to pro-fibrotic activity, TGF-\u03b2 also has a major role in the regulation of immune cell functions. TGF-\u03b21 knockout mice showed a multifocal, mixed inflammatory cell response and tissue necrosis, leading to organ failure and death [65]. Consistently, blocking TGF-\u03b2 signaling via specific deletion of TGF-\u03b2 type II receptor in T cells leads to disruption of T-cell development as well as homeostasis, resulting in autoimmune inflammation and death at last [66]. TGF-\u03b2 also regulates the differentiation and activation of many other leukocytes, including B cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages, granulocytes, and mast cells [67]. Thus, TGF-\u03b2 is a key regulator in immune system homeostasis, and dysfunction of TGF-\u03b2 may results in disorders of this system, such as autoimmunity or inflammatory bowel disease. In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, the phosphorylation level of Smad3 is very low, and the formation of Smad3\u2013Smad4 complex is also affected, so TGF-\u03b2 signaling is disrupted despite the abundance of TGF-\u03b2 in the inflamed gut [68,69]. Instead, Smad7 level is elevated in the tissues with inflammatory bowel disease. When Smad7 was reduced by anti-sense oligonucleotides, Smad3 activation was restored and the inflammation was subsequently inhibited by endogenous TGF-\u03b2 [70]. Conversely, Smad7 may also mediate the anti-inflammatory activity of TGF-\u03b2 in other situations by inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling upon activation by inflammatory cytokines like interleukine 1 or TNF-\u03b1. Smad7 has also been shown to disrupt the TRAF6\u2013TAK1\u2013TAB2/3 signaling complex or to induce the expression of I\u03baB, which induces the degradation of NF-\u03baB subunits by the proteasomal pathway, therefore resulting in inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling. In addition, Smad7 has been shown to be a key negative regulator of the renal inflammatory response [62,68,71,72]. These results suggest that Smad7 may have both anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory functions.",

            "text": "TGF-\u03b2 has anti-proliferative effects in epithelial cells. However, it can also promote tumorigenesis by modulating processes such as cell invasion, metastasis, immune regulation, and microenvironment modification that cancer cells may exploit for their own good [2]. Smad7 has been shown to play a role in these processes. A genome-wide association study showed that common alleles of Smad7 influenced the risk of colorectal cancer [73]. As a key negative regulator of TGF-\u03b2 signaling, Smad7 has been reported to inhibit the formation of osteolytic metastases by human breast cancer and melanoma when overexpressed [74\u201376]. In addition, it also inhibits endometrial carcinomas, thyroid follicular tumors, and hepatocellular carcinomas [77\u201379]. Azuma et al. [80] reported that overexpression of Smad7 in mouse mammary carcinoma JygMC(A) cells inhibits their metastasis via upregulation of E-cadherin and downregulation of N-cadherin, leading to a reduction of cell migration [81]. In other cases, Smad7 can promote tumorigenesis. For instance, Smad7 blocks TGF-\u03b2-mediated growth inhibition and inhibits apoptosis in pancreatic cancer as well as FET cells [82,83]. Liu et al. [84] also reported that in a xenograft model, when primary keratinocytes were co-transfected with Smad7 and H-ras, mixed with dermal fibroblasts, and grafted into nude mice, they progressed into skin squamous cell carcinomas, while control cells did not. Since Smad7 has been shown to degrade \u03b2-catenin by recruiting Smurf2, and reduced Wnt signaling leads to spontaneous skin cancer in mice [85], it would be interesting to examine the relationship among Smad7, Wnt signaling, and skin cancer. On the other hand, enhanced Wnt signaling contributes to many different types of cancers. Therefore, the role of Smad7 in the process of tumor formation is very complicated and varies depending on tumor types and their microenvironments [86].",
