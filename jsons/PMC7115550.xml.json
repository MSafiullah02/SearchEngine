We have previously shown that ALVAC enhanced both Th1 humoral and cellular immune responses to co-injected protein antigens in a mouse model. Precisely, ALVAC increased the levels of antigen-specific IgG2a antibodies and the number of IFN\u03b3 secreting cells in response to co-injected cytomegalovirus (CMV) gB or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Tat protein antigens, compared to antigen alone. The adjuvant effect of ALVAC was dependent on the presence of IFN\u03b3 produced by natural killer (NK) cells [15]. Neutrophil infiltration at the ALVAC injection site was demonstrated by Boudet et al. also suggesting that ALVAC induces pro-inflammatory mechanisms [14].",

Both murine and human cells of the myeloid lineage, particularly immature MDDCs, are readily infected by ALVAC resulting in maturation of these cells [17], [18], [19]. In the present study we also observed DC partial maturation following ALVAC infection of immature MDDCs.

The majority of the genes up-regulated following ALVAC infection was involved in the type I IFN pathway. In contrast, genes involved in the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines) were not up-regulated. The gene encoding for the chemokine CXCL10, a direct target of the transcription factor IRF3, was up-regulated in response to ALVAC. CXCL10 protein secretion in the supernatants of ALVAC infected DCs was confirmed by ELISA. The expression of a number of known interferon responsive genes such as IRF7, RIG-1 and MDA-5 as well as anti-viral genes like OAS, Mx, ISG15, and PKR were enhanced in human MDDCs cells following ALVAC infection. In this study, we focused on the ISG15 gene in view of increasing evidence suggesting its role in the regulation of immune responses [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. The induction of the free form of ISG15 in human MDDCs was confirmed by Western blot analysis. These results support the hypothesis that ALVAC activates IFR3 and IFR7 mediated induction of the type I IFN signaling cascade through a cytosolic pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) sensing dsDNA viruses, such as the recently reported \u201cDNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory molecule\u201d (DAI) [30], [31].",

When tested by reverse-transcripase PCR (RT-PCR) IFN-\u03b2 was expressed at the highest level after 16 h of ALVAC infection in accordance with the positive-feedback loop (Fig. 4\n). Neither IFN-\u03b1 nor IFN-\u03b2 were detected in the supernatants of ALVAC infected MDDCs by ELISA (detection level \u223c15 pg/ml). To explain this observation, it should be considered that IFN-\u03b1 subtype expression is cell-type, donor and stimuli dependent and that not all the subtypes (13 in humans) were represented on the microarray chip (IFN-\u03b1 subtypes present on the microarray chip: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, and 21). Furthermore, MDDCs are known to be poor producers of type I IFNs, these are mainly secreted by plasmacytoid DCs and their precursors [35]. Therefore, the levels of type I IFNs in the supernatants might be below the detection limit of the assays used.",

Human MDDCs were incubated for 48 h with ALVAC at a MOI of 0.2, subsequently the supernatants were collected and the concentration of CXCL10 was measured by ELISA. In accordance with the enhanced gene transcription, MDDCs released high amounts of CXCL10 in response to ALVAC (Fig. 5\n). These results confirm our previous findings in the mouse model, in which high levels of CXCL10 secretion by bone marrow derived dendritic cells in response to ALVAC was observed [15]. In addition, this finding supports the hypothesis that ALVAC activates an IRF3-mediated signaling pathway, as the activated form of IRF3 directly targets CXCL10 gene transcription [31], [36].",

Interferon alpha induced release of CXCL10 by MDDCs at a lesser extent than ALVAC and this secretion was completely blocked by the neutralizing anti-IFN type I receptor antibody. These findings strongly argue in favor of the release of type I IFNs in this system which could not be detected in the ELISA experiments. Therefore, these results support a key role for type I IFN in the amplification of CXCL10 secreted by MDDCs in response to ALVAC infection, in accordance with the proposed mechanism of action (Fig. 3).",

Interferon via an IRF3 mediated pathway strongly activates the production of free ISG15 as well as protein ISGylation, which is the conjugation/deconjugation of ISG15 to target proteins via specific enzymes (UBP43 and UBE1L; whose expression is also regulated by type I IFN). Although, the functional consequences of ISGylation are not yet completely understood, there is increasing evidence to suggest a role in innate anti-viral responses [39], [40]. The free form of ISG15 has been described as an interferon-induced cytokine with immunoregulatory properties [27], [28]. Considering the potential role of ISG15 in the IFN mediated innate anti-viral response, we further analyzed the effect of ALVAC on this interferon responsive gene in MDDCs. We evaluated the induction of ISG15 in MDDCs following ALVAC infection at the protein level by Western blot analysis. Human MDDCs were cultured in the presence of 0.2 MOI ALVAC or human leukocyte interferon (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03c9), as positive control, for 48 h, then cells were harvested, lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequently analyzed by Western blot. A band of 15 kDa, corresponding to the expected size of the free form of ISG15, was detected in the ALVAC as well as in the IFN treated MDDCs but not in the untreated MDDCs. Equal protein loading was verified by blotting the same membrane for the housekeeping gene GAPDH (Fig. 5). This data confirmed the induction of ISG15 in response to ALVAC at the protein level. Further analyses will establish if ISG15 is also released into the supernatant thereby influencing other cell types.",

            "text": "In order to optimize the benefit of prophylactic or therapeutic immunization strategies, particularly those targeting cancer or viral infections, vaccines need to be able to induce and sustain cellular immune responses. ALVAC, a recombinant canarypox virus, is considered to be a good candidate vaccine vector with the potential to meet this need. ALVAC vaccine constructs can induce specific cellular and humoral immune responses against multiple pathogens and have a good safety profile [41]. Moreover, several canarypox virus recombinant vaccines are licensed for veterinary use [42]. ALVAC can be engineered to encode different foreign antigens and in contrast to vaccinia virus vectors, the problem of pre-existing immunity to the vector is circumvented. In addition to the antigen carrier function, it has also been reported that ALVAC itself exerts an adjuvant effect when administered with recombinant protein antigens in mice [14], [15]. This property is most likely linked to the stimulation of the innate immune system by ALVAC virus infection. Innate immunity is initiated by cells sensing foreign molecules known as \u201cpathogen associated molecular patterns\u201d (PAMP) through pattern-recognition receptors (PRR). Two classes of PRRs have been identified [31], [43], the trans-membrane PRRs, including the TLRs and some scavengers or lectin-like receptors and the cytosolic PRRs, including NOD and RIG-1 among others. Toll-like receptors sense bacterial or viral PAMPS and lead to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines via the NF-kB signaling pathway and for some TLRs (TLR3, TLR7/9) secretion of type I IFN via the IRF3/IRF7 signal transducers [31]. In the cytoplasm, the Nod-like receptors detect intracellular bacterial PAMPs, while RIG-1 and MDA-5 detect virus-derived RNA leading to activation of IFR3/IRF7 and NF-\u03baB signaling cascades [43]. The existence of cytoplasmic dsDNA sensors has been long suspected since some DNA viruses, replicating in the cytoplasm, are able to induce type I interferon responses. Recently, Toneguchi and co-workers discovered the first cytosolic dsDNA sensor DAI (DLM-1/ZBP1), ligation of which leads to type I IFN gene induction through IRF3 and IRF7 and independently from TLR activation [30].",

            "text": "The majority of genes up-regulated by ALVAC belong to the type I IFN pathway. Interaction between IFNs and their receptors (IFNR1 and IFNR2) promotes activation of the ISG3 signal transducer, a heterotrimer composed of STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9. Once ISG3 translocates to the nucleus, this complex activates the transcription of IRF7, MDA-5 and RIG-1 genes, all of which contribute to the positive feedback regulation of the IFN pathway. We found that the transcription of STAT1, IRF7, MDA-5 and RIG-1 was up-regulated in response to ALVAC. In addition, the expression of the interferon inducible and anti-viral genes OAS, PKR, Mx and ISG15 was enhanced following ALVAC infection of MDDCs. However, genes involved in the NF-\u03baB signaling cascade were not found to be up-regulated in human MDDC upon ALVAC infection. In the light of these results, we propose that ALVAC, a dsDNA virus that resides in the cytoplasm of the cell, induces an interferon-mediated innate immune response in an IRF3/IRF7 dependent and TLR-independent way through recognition by a cytosolic dsDNA sensing PRR, such as the recently reported DAI molecule [30].",

Furthermore, the fact that ALVAC infected MDDCs secreted reduced levels of CXCL10 in the presence of neutralizing type I IFN-receptor antibody suggests a primary effect of ALVAC and a secondary effect of type I IFNs on MDDCs, thereby supporting the proposed model. CXCL10 (IP-10), is a chemotactic factor for T cells [46] and NK cells [47] expressing CXCR3 receptor. Recent studies with CXCL10 neutralizing antibodies or CXCL10 deficient mice demonstrated that the absence of functional CXCL10 resulted in increased mortality and reduced T cell infiltration in the brains of mice intracerebrally infected with a murine coronavirus, illustrating the importance of this chemokine in co-coordinating a protective immune response against a viral pathogen [48], [49], [50]. In addition, CXCL10 release might attract NK cells to DC rich areas bringing them in close contact and thereby triggering a downstream TH1 response by secreting IFN\u03b3 [51]. Here, we have demonstrated that human MDDCs secrete high levels of CXCL10 following incubation with ALVAC, thus confirming our microarray results, as well as data obtained in vivo in mice following ALVAC injections [15].",

            "text": "ISG15, is an ubiquitin-like protein modifier whose gene expression is induced by several stimuli, besides IRF3, type I interferon (ISG15 is one of the earliest ISGs induced), LPS, retinoic acid, campothecin and radiation [52]. The conjugation of ISG15 to intracellular protein targets is a reversible process controlled by a conjugating enzyme and a deconjugating enzyme, UBE1L and UBP43, respectively. Both enzymes are induced by type I interferon. Currently about 200 ISGylated proteins have been identified, among them IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-induced anti-viral proteins, such as PKR, MxA, HuP56, and RIG-1 [40], [53]. The effect of ISGylation on protein function, distribution or stability is not yet fully understood. However, accumulating evidence, including the ability of many viruses to either inhibit the production of free ISG15 or the formation of ISG15 conjugates, indicates an anti-viral role for this protein [26], [26], [40], [53]. The free form of ISG15 has been described as an interferon-induced cytokine with immunoregulatory properties [27], [28]. Human lymphocytes and monocytes release ISG15 into culture medium following in vitro stimulation with IFN-\u03b2 and free ISG15 has been detected in the serum of IFN-\u03b2-treated patients [28]. Furthermore, it has been shown that recombinant ISG15 stimulates IFN-\u03b3 production by CD3+ lymphocytes and increase proliferation of CD56+ NK cells [27]. We show here, for the first time, that ALVAC infection of human MDDCs induced gene expression of ISG15 and both its conjugating and deconjugating enzymes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the protein expression of ISG15 is enhanced in ALVAC infected MDCCs by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6\n).",

            "text": "While, our microarray data failed to show the up-regulation of IFN-\u03b1, we detected enhanced IFN-\u03b2 expression in two of four donors. Recent data suggest that the expression of the different IFN-\u03b1 subtypes (13 in human) is cell-type and stimulus specific [28]. The fact that not all IFN-\u03b1 subtypes were represented on the microarray chip may explain the lack of IFN-\u03b1 gene up-regulation observed in the microarray data. However, the secretion of type-I IFN by ALVAC infected DCs was indirectly demonstrated by the reduced capacity of these cells to secrete CXCL10 in the presence of a type I IFN-receptor neutralizing antibody (Fig. 5). Surprisingly, MyD88 gene transcription was also up-regulated by ALVAC in all four donors. The adaptor molecule MyD88 is essential for all TLR signaling leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (except TLR3) and is also required for TLR 7 and 9 signaling resulting in type I interferon secretion [43], [54]. Since we found no evidence for enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine gene transcription following ALVAC infection upon analysis of our microarray results and type I interferon MyD88-mediated secretion via TLR7/9 does not involve IRF3 activation, the MyD88 induction might be attributed to other functions rather than the adaptor one [54]. This study confirms that ALVAC infection induces the maturation of MDDCs [15], [17], [55]. However, we made the additional observation that as opposed to LPS stimulation, ALVAC induced lower levels of co-stimulatory molecules and failed to up-regulate CD25 which has been demonstrated to be essential for DC mediated T cell activation and IL-2 secretion [33]. These results suggest that ALVAC does not induce full DC maturation. The consequences of this finding on the activation of the specific T cell response against ALVAC encoded antigens were not investigated in the present study. This is of great interest and will be subject of further research.",

(Left side) We propose that ALVAC is detected by a cytoplasmic dsDNA sensor which leads to the phosphorylation of IRF3 via TBK1. Phosphorylated IRF3 homodimerizes or heterodimerizes with IRF7 and migrates to the nucleus where it directly induces the expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, CXCL10 and ISG15 among others. In a positive feedback loop type I IFNs induce gene expression of IRF7, MDA-5, RIG-1, etc. (Right side) Two-dimensional hierarchical clustering was performed using Rosetta Resolver System Software. Columns represent gene expression data for four distinct donors from an individual experiment. The intensity of the color red indicates the degree of up-regulation, genes which did not meet the required p-value of 0.05 are colored in grey.",

Amplification of the IFN\u03b2 and \u03b2-actin encoding genes was performed by RT-PCR as described in Section 2. A band of the expected size of 185 nt was detected in MDDCs upon ALVAC infection and Poly I:C stimulation.
