Nevertheless, a nationwide analysis in China observed that patients with cancer had a higher risk of severe events compared with patients without cancer and that patients who underwent chemotherapy or surgery in the previous month had a higher risk of severe events.6They noted that cancer patients had a higher risk of COVID-19 and that these patients had poorer outcomes than patients without cancer.6",

The basis of these side effects is due to hyperactivated T-cell response with reactivity directed against normal tissue.27 Immune checkpoint inhibitors have rare side effects of thrombocytopenia and pneumonitis T-cell transfer therapy, consists of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-celltherapy. Side effects for TIL include prolonged lymphopenia, and CAR T-cell therapy can lead to cytokine release syndrome.27\u201329 Cancer vaccines are associated with minimal toxicity.27 Finally, certain immune-modulating agents can cause thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, and vascular permeability leading to pleural effusion or pulmonary edema.27 Interestingly, some immune-modulating agents that diminish inflammation during infection have shown therapeutic promise in mice models infected with various influenza strains.30",
