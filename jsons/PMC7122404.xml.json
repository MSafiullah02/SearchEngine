While first reported in China, COVID\u201019 is no longer restricted to that country, and the increasing number of cases and alarming levels of geographical spread raises grave worries about its future direction.\n1\n On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID\u201019 outbreak a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern\u201d (PHEIC), and, by March 19, 2020, over a 160 countries have reported cases of COVID\u201019. More than 209 000 cases have been confirmed globally, with approximately 39% of them in China; more than 8700 people have died worldwide.\n2\n Importantly, however, some countries have demonstrated the ability to slow or partially limit transmission of the COVID\u201019 virus, SARS\u2010CoV\u2010.\n2\n\n",

Turkey ranks sixth in the world in terms of number of tourists and 14th in terms of tourism income.\n5\n Turkey is surrounded by eight countries, namely, Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia, Armenia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Azerbaijan, and cases of COVID\u201019 have been reported in most of these countries.\n2\n In light of the coronavirus outbreak, Turkey announced to cease all flights from China\n6\n and closed its border with Iran and Iraq.\n7\n The ministry also established field hospitals near the Iraq and Iran borders. However, despite these precautionary measures, by March 19, Turkey had more than 190 confirmed COVID\u201019 cases and two deaths.2, 8\n",

The WHO developed a strategic preparedness and response plan for COVID\u201019 which aims to slow and stop transmission, prevent outbreaks and delay spread, provide optimized care for all patients (especially the serious ill cases), and minimize the potential impact of the epidemic on health systems, social services, and economic activity.\n3\n\n",

The COVID\u201019 epidemic is a problematic and complicated situation that requires concerted efforts at both national and international levels to tackle. Therefore, and given the reporting of Turkey's first cases, Turkish health care authorities should keep up\u2010to\u2010date with factual information and recommendations from the WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other organizations about COVID\u201019 to try to contain the disease at this early stage. Moreover, they should carefully formulate national guidelines in light of interim recommendations for responding to community spread,\n9\n and on information on critical preparedness and response actions,\n3\n healthcare planning checklists,\n10\n resources for healthcare professionals,\n11\n and on advice for the public on COVID\u201019 proper measures, to prevent the rapid transmission and possible spread of this infection.",
