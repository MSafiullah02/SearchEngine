The cases of patients with preexisting kidney disease prior to pregnancy differs in the differential diagnosis from new onset kidney disease that develops because of pregnancy. The focus of this chapter is to review the evaluation of new onset kidney injury as a result of pregnancy. This chapter does not attempt to review the newly diagnosed patient with kidney disease that may be discovered during pregnancy, that in and of itself is not thought related to pregnancy. When kidney involvement occurs, from proteinuria alone to elevation of creatinine, pathologic systemic changes related to the fetal-placenta interaction provokes the obstetric provider to heighten their level of concern for the maturing fetus and the welfare of the mother. While the diagnosis of preeclampsia is easily the first consideration given how common it is, a broaden differential is employed. Before doing so, a discussion of kidney physiology during pregnancy is prudent as well as a review of the diagnostic tools used in kidney function assessment during pregnancy.",

The best test was discerned by comparing inulin versus 24 h creatinine clearance as well as using the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula in healthy pregnant women and women with preeclampsia or chronic kidney disease (CKD) [3]. In healthy pregnant women the 24 h creatinine clearance was better than the MDRD by 40 cc/min. In women with preeclampsia or prior CKD the MDRD underestimated the GFR in both by 25 cc/min. Because the GFRs were >60 the MDRD formula loses its\u2019 integrity in this population. Following serum creatinines is certainly useful, but the absence of changes in creatinine may not be indicative of true GFR changes and so 24 h urine collections may be instructive.",

If one assumes the urine protein to creatinine ratio (PCR) is expected to hold in pregnancy, it is useful for quantification for diagnosis of preeclampsia and monitor preexisting kidney disease. Urine dipsticks routinely have high rates of false positives and negatives compared to 24 h urines and do not take into consideration the specific gravity in the guidelines when assessing proteinuria such as in preeclampsia. Most nephrologists do not speak in terms of urine protein dipsticks. However, urinary stasis complicates the utility of the urine PCR. There is sufficient data in the literature that demonstrates that the spot urine PCR has been shown to correlate well with 24 h urine collections [4, 5].

Obstetrical hemorrhage can occur during pregnancy, immediately postpartum or delayed postpartum. Severe cases can cause hemorrhagic shock, thus leading to renal hypoperfusion and oligouria. Identifying and correcting the source of bleeding is the mainstay of treatment, as is aggressive replacement of blood products.

The classic presentation of this rare disease is hypoglycemia, transaminitis, elevated coagulation studies, hypofibrinogenemia, kidney injury, and fatty infiltration of the liver. However, the exclusion of these signs does not rule out the diagnosis. The largest series of AFLP studied to date came from a population of over 1.1 million deliveries in the United Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System Study between 2005 and 2006 [6]. Providers diagnosed only 61 women with AFLP, 90% of which were retrospectively confirmed by the authors using the previously described Swansea criteria [7] (see Table 48.3). Of the 57 women meeting the criteria for the diagnosis of AFLP, 1 woman died; and of the 67 infants, there were 7 deaths, yielding a perinatal mortality rate of 104 per 1,000 births.\n",

This renders the mother susceptible to hypercalcemia. With increased use of calcium and vitamin D supplements to treat osteoporosis and when used to treat gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) exacerbated by pregnancy, milk alkali syndrome occurs [18]. GERD is a common problem in pregnancy occurring in 30\u201356% of all pregnancies and therefore with indiscriminate use of calcium products lead to the syndrome [19]. The kidney injury from hypercalcemia has several mechanisms. It causes afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and decreases renal blood flow and GFR. Increased calcium binds to calcium-sensitive receptors in the medullary thick ascending limb and inhibits Na-K-2Cl cotransporter and blocks sodium reabsorption leading to volume depletion. Increased calcium in the tubulointerstitium can affect kidney function as well. The treatment is avoidance of calcium and vitamin D, control of emesis and volume resuscitation.

Several factors are thought to contribute to these physiologic changes that most commonly do not lead to renal injury. Progesterone reduces ureteral tone and contractility. Enlarged blood vessels in the pelvis may cause ureteral compression, especially at the pelvic brim. The enlarging uterus displaces the ureters laterally, and on rare occasions can directly compress the ureters. The resulting urinary obstruction is marked by severe abdominal pain and inability to void. Resolution with maternal position changes aids in making the diagnosis. In these severe cases ureteral stents can relieve the ureteral compression, but in case of stent failure, delivery may be required.",

The symptoms are similar to the nonpregnant patient with abdominal or flank pain, nausea, vomiting, and hematuria with 42% of these patients having pyuria on urinalysis [23].

Approximately 2% of women with pyelonephritis develop acute renal failure which may or may not be reversible [43]. If biopsied, microabscesses may be found. Treatment is with empiric i.v. antibiotics until culture results are available, and until the patient is 24\u201348 h afebrile.

            "text": "As a way of categorizing vascular involvement as a cause of intrinsic acute kidney injury, one may distinguish this entity from both large and small vessels. The large renal arteries, when occluded, may be defined as prerenal kidney failure. When the small capillaries in the glomerular are primarily involved, this is nephritis or nephrosis. When the interlobular arteries are involved, we speak of intrinsic vascular involvement. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is an intrinsic cause of renal vascular disease. It is composed of the syndromes thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS), both of which are seen in pregnancy. The pathology does overlap, with thrombi in the glomeruli, and injury to the interlobular arteries is seen as intimal thickening and onion skinning. The pathogenesis relates to Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) maintenance by ADAMTS-13 enzyme molecules [57]. The VWF multimeric structures are secreted from stimulated endothelial cells. When the activity of ADAMTS-13 is absent or reduced, VWF cleavage does not occur and platelets adhere and aggregate onto the uncleaved VWF molecules forming microvascular platelet thrombi. Severe congenital deficiency of ADAMTS-13 caused by gene mutations or inhibition of the enzyme caused by acquired autoantibodies, inflammatory cytokines, estrogen or bacterial toxins, results in TTP [57]. HUS is described in association with infections by the Shiga toxin-producing hemorrhagic strains of E. coli [58]. HUS presents with a greater degree of kidney injury, potentially requiring renal replacement therapy. TTP-HUS is extremely rare during pregnancy and postpartum. They afflict <1 case in 100,000 pregnancies [59]. One review of the literature from 1955 to 2006, only noted 166 cases of TTP, distinguished from HUS by creatinines <3 mg/dl, and 55% of the cases occurred in the second trimester, whereas 33% occurred after 28 weeks [60]. The classic diagnosis of TTP/HUS includes the pentad of thrombocytopenia, Coombs negative hemolytic anemia, kidney injury, neurologic abnormalities, and fever but not all of these findings are present. The ADAMTS-13 activity is absent to markedly reduced in 33\u2013100% of patients with TTP but in HUS that is not the case [59]. TTP-HUS has similarities with HELLP that may confuse the diagnosis and therefore the management. TTP/HUS should be favored as a diagnosis if the patient has a past history of TTP/HUS, ADAMTS-13 activity <5%, severe hemolytic anemia, markedly reduce platelets, a bloody diarrheal prodrome, congenital TTP-HUS, or presentation in the first trimester. Plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma should be considered if a HELLP-like syndrome persists beyond 3 days postpartum and/or sooner if there is life-threatening microangiopathy. Our case #1 had diarrhea, but the platelets were only modestly reduced and the LDH was only modestly increased and there were no shistocytes on the smear, making TTP-HUS less likely. In case #2, the moderate shistocytes and more elevated creatinine raises the specter of TTP-HUS more so and thus plasma exchange should be considered as the patient is followed.",

The creatinine of 1.1 mg/dl appears normal for a nonpregnant patient but is noticeable elevated for pregnancy. The initial blood pressure does not meet the defined criteria for this disease but that is not always necessary and certainly blood pressures may fluctuate. The patient does have other constitutional signs consistent with a systemic process, and the subsequent blood pressures became consistent with preeclampsia. Other considerations for her presentation are AFLP as the patient meets six or more of the Swansea criteria, those being vomiting, elevated bilirubin, uric acid, ammonia, AST, PT, and leukocytosis. If the patient has HELLP, it is likely considered partial as the AST is not >70 U/l, the platelet count is not <100,000, the LDH is not >600 U/l and there was no hemolysis seen on the peripheral smear. TTP is unlikely without hemolysis but this and HUS should be followed after delivery.

This patient has elevated blood pressures without proteinuria, thus she does not meet criteria for preeclampsia. Proteinuria is not necessary for the diagnosis of HELLP syndrome, and in such circumstances the diagnosis is known as \u201catypical HELLP.\u201d She has several features of HELLP syndrome including severe right upper quadrant pain, evidence of hemolysis, mildly elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets. But the clinical picture is confused by renal insufficiency which is a sign of possible TTP-HUS. Whereas the clinical picture for HELLP and TTP-HUS is very similar, treatment strategies are quite different. Delivery for this patient is indicated, as preeclampsia or some variant (such as HELLP), cannot be completely excluded. Given the elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and RUQ pain, HUS is an unlikely diagnosis, but should be considered, especially if the patient does not improve clinically within 48 h after delivery. Postpartum, the patient\u2019s AST and ALT continued to rise peaking in the 300 s and her platelets fell to a nadir of 32,000 on postpartum day 1 with a stable creatinine. In this case, a multidisciplinary team with seasoned expert consultants can be helpful in determining if plasma exchange is necessary.
