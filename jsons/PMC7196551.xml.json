The heightened oxidative stress caused by CS dissociates transcription factor Nrf2 from kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) [36], eventually translocating into nucleus followed by binding to antioxidant response elements (ARE). These events regulate downstream gene expression for phase II detoxification enzymes such as glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) [37], that promote in maintaining cellular redox balance [38]. Therefore, Nrf2 signaling pathways present potential therapeutic target against the physiological redox imbalance [39].",

Reportedly, the identified six test alkaloids significantly attenuated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), upregulated the level of antioxidant molecule glutathione (GSH), and promoted the Nrf2 induced expression of HO-1 protein. Notably, the presence of glucoside moiety at C-3 position in alkaloid 5, and absence of \u03b2-OH at C-17 position in alkaloid 6 resulted in higher GSH/GSSG ratio. Similarly, the presence of \u03b2-CH3 substituent at C-20 position in alkaloid 3 favored its efficacy and tolerable cytotoxicity. The presence of \u2013OH substitution at C-3 position in all the test alkaloids demonstrated a paramount importance for inducing HO-1 expression, which diminished in the presence of C\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\nO group at the same position [40].",

The administration of total alkaloids produced marked effect as compared to the single test alkaloid, hence confirming a synergistic effect. Moreover, these alkaloids proved useful for the treatment of post-infectious symptoms in animal models by mitigating the levels of inflammatory cytokines followed by down-regulation of the expression of IL-6.

Moreover, it also reduced the IL-13 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage, which serves as the key regulator of AHR [46]. The test alkaloid checked the ovalbumin (OVA)-induced eosinophil intrusion in the tissues, and downregulated the mucus production and subepithelial fibrosis. Further analysis of airway mucins by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining revealed OVA induced metaplasia and mucus accumulation in animal models, which reduced significantly after warifteine administration.",

The inactive form of test flavonoids metabolized in vivo to anti-complimentary active metabolite aglycones 47\u201353 (Fig. 4) by the enzyme \u03b2-glucuronidase secreted by the epithelial cells, which demonstrated superior absorption into IAV-induced ALI animal models [61]. The infected animal models demonstrated a better metabolic transformation of the test flavonoids to active metabolites, with elevated levels in lungs and intestine, with higher content in the latter suggesting that the test flavonoids reach intestine first and then transformed to active metabolites before finally becoming a part of systemic circulation. The active metabolites 47\u201353 after reaching the lungs reportedly downregulate the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1), while raising the levels of IL-10 and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), and considerably lowered the production of nitric oxide (NO) from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells thereby attenuating the activity of target virus [62].",

The exposure of the respiratory airways to oxidants results in epithelial cell necrosis and functional impairment due to defective expression of adherens junction proteins such as E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. Hence, E-cadherin maintains epithelial barrier stability of the airway mucosa and allergic sensitization, which lowers in asthma condition thereby promoting the infiltration of oxidants via defected airway epithelium [94].

These chemokines play a critical role in the recruitment of neutrophils in the lungs inflamed with cystic fibrosis. The investigations suggested that \u03b2-sitosterol partially inhibited LPS-triggered activation of Protein Kinase C isoform alpha, associated with transmembrane signaling for the activation of the expression of IL-8 gene in bronchial epithelial cells. Hence, \u03b2-sitosterol effectively mitigates the chronic lung inflammation in the patients with cystic fibrosis [96]. Further investigations suggested the attenuation of pulmonary fibrosis by \u03b2-sitosterol, by preventing the abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), manifesting deleterious effects to the alveolar epithelium resulting in epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT). \u03b2-sitosterol, reportedly displayed anti-fibrotic effect while inhibiting EMT by downregulating the expression of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21). Notably, treatment with \u03b2-sitosterol convincingly blocked TGF-\u03b21-induced protein expression of EMT markers, N-cadherin, vimentin, and E-cadherin [97].",

Ursolic acid displayed significant inhibition of airway inflammation via suppression of Th2 cytokines such as IL-5, IgE, and CCR3 expression [98]. Ursolic acid reportedly displays chemotherapeutic effect on COPD, and provides protection against cigarette smoke induced cell injury by suppressing the lung tumor metastasis [99]. The therapeutic effect of allergic asthma arises due to increase in the expression of PPARg and attenuated GATA-3 and STAT6 expression, resulting in a decrease of antigen-induced Penh, eosinophilia, lung inflammation, and the production of cytokines and antigen-specific IgE that play vital role in coordinating and intensifying the allergic inflammation in asthma [100]. Reportedly, the treatment with ursolic acid alleviates emphysema instigated by cigarette smoke by PERK pathway, as well as Nrf2 pathway [101]. The activation of PERK discourages protein synthesis via phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiator factor, thereby causing a selective translation of ATF4, which controls the expression of critical apoptotic association genes.",

The effect of plant stanol added in soy-based yogurts in half of the patient on comparison with remaining half receiving control yogurt (placebo group) suggested considerable therapeutic results. It was observed that patients receiving plant based stanol ester group showed increased antibody titres against hepatitis A virus after 3 week [19% (P = 0.037)] and 4 wk [22% (P = 0.030)] of vaccination. Likewise, there was a marked depletion in plasma total IgE, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 in plant-stanol ester group compared to placebo control. Furthermore, a correlation appeared between the increase in serum plant-stanol concentrations and decrease in IL-13 concentrations as well as Th1 switch in the Th1/Th2 balance [113].

            "text": "Chronic respiratory disorders mainly arise due to the bronchial and pulmonary inflammation arising due to the heightened innate response causing an upsurge of proinflammatory metabolites, and over activity of enzyme such as cyclooxygenases, and lipoxygenases. The inhalation of toxicants manifests the recruitment of inflammatory cells in the bronchial and alveolar mucosa. The perseverance of nonspecific macrophages and adaptive T-lymphocytes even after the prolonged stimuli cassation inappropriately instigates the memory cells of adaptive immunity, an event further maintained by dendritic cells, which also induce remodeling of lung tissue. In addition, the oxidative stress and disturbance in protease/antiprotease balance deter the beneficial effects of corticosteroids in managing airway inflammation.",

The involvement of multiple regulatory pathways in mediating respiratory disorders necessitates the development of multi-targeting medications. The practice of polypharmacy holds considerable potential for effectively managing the composite pulmonary maladies, considering the patient compliance. Mucoactive drugs such as \u2018erdosteine\u2019 combat broncho-obstructive symptoms by reinstating mucociliary clearance.",

Similarly, the pulmonary disorders caused by multidrug-resistant microbes such as mycobacterium tuberculosis, and streptococcus pneumoniae requires innovative pharmaceuticals with multifarious targeting potential. Reportedly, the isoniazid monotherapy or rifampicin or pyrazinamide bitherapy proved inadequate for the disease management and resulted in its recurrent cycles. Hence, the recommended anti-TB regimen suggests polypharmacy as preliminary combination therapy of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and pyridoxine to prevent the recurrence of disease. Nevertheless, the amenability of the subjects to the combination of drugs, and the probability of microbial susceptibility to the administered doses raises compulsion for the identification of physiologically tolerable, novel pharmacophores for which the natural products present an ideal profile.",
