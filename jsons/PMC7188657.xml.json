The government strictly managed the movement and gathering of people, and restrictions on non-essential social activities were strictly enforced. The outbreak of COVID-19 and series of strict control measures adopted by the government had many negative effects on individuals and society. The population may experience restriction of activities, panic, poor mental health, loss of relatives, life-threatening situations, unemployment, reduced income, and separation from their families or partners2. Individuals may also experience unique changes in their sexual behaviors under these unprecedented conditions3. However, sexual behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic have not been examined. This study aimed to assess changes in the sexual behaviors of young women and men during the COVID-19 outbreak.",

The difference between men and women was statistically significant (F = 12.09, df = 2, p = 0.002), and the difference reported here is attributed to the decrease (F = 3.99, df = 1, p = 0.046) and increase (F = 10.28, df = 1, p = 0.001) in the desire (compared to unchanged). The results showed that 44% of participants reported a decrease in the number of sexual partners, with men slightly more likely than women to report a decrease in the number of sexual partners (53% vs. 30%). There was good agreement between men and women in terms of sexual frequency, with about 37% of participants reporting decreased sexual frequency. A sub-analysis of married individuals showed that all participants had similar characteristics, 49% of married men and 29% of married women reported a decrease in the number of sexual partners and 36% of married men and 28% of married women reported a decrease in the frequency of sexual activities. Through multiple regression analysis, we found that age, partner relationship, and sexual desire were closely related to sexual frequency (Table 2\n). During the COVID-19 outbreak, 32% of men and 39% of women experienced a reduction in sexual satisfaction. The difference between men and women was statistically significant (F = 14.49, df = 2, p = 0.001). In addition, most participants with a history of risky sexual experiences had a reduction in risky sexual behaviors after the COVID-19 outbreak. In fact, only five individuals reported an increase in risky behaviors during this period.",

In addition, it is undeniable that strict physical restrictions have directly impacted the possibility of having new sexual partners and risky sexual behaviors. However, in the supplementary question, 32% of men and 18% of women indicated that they were inclined to increase the number of sexual partners or risky sexual behaviors once the epidemic ended.

First, race and ethnic culture appear to have a significant association with the occurrence of sexual problems8. For example, most young Chinese people live with their parents (72% in the current study), which is different from results reported in other countries and may be a significant factor that can limit their sexual behaviors. Therefore, the small sample size from a single ethnicity and the lack of randomization are also limitations for the extrapolation of the results to the global general population. Second, the use of unverified questionnaires and retrospective evaluations of sexual behavior was also a weakness of the study. In addition, we did not collect data form participants who did not complete the questionnaire. Hence, the characteristics of these individuals and their impact on the overall data were not analyzed.",
