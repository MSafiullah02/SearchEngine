Similar to adult-onset MS, children present with visual and sensory complaints, as well as weakness, spasticity, and ataxia. A lumbar puncture can be helpful in diagnosing MS when CSF immunoglobulins and oligoclonal bands are present. White matter demyelinating lesions on MRI are required for the diagnosis; however, children typically have fewer lesions than adults. Many criteria have been proposed to diagnose MS that have been applied to children, mostly above 10 years of age. The recent revisions to the McDonald criteria allow for earlier diagnosis, such as after a clinically isolated event. However, children are more likely than adults to have monosymptomatic illnesses. None of the approved disease-modifying therapies used in adult-onset MS have been approved for pediatrics; however, a few studies have verified their safety and tolerability in children. Although children and adults with MS have similar neurological symptoms, laboratory (cerebrospinal fluid) data, and neuroimaging findings, the clinical course, pathogenesis, and treatment of childhood onset MS require further investigation.",

The study concluded that children and adults with MS have similar clinical profiles, including mode of onset, symptoms, and physical and laboratory (cerebral spinal fluid [CSF]) findings.

In 1987, Duquette et al. reviewed 125 pediatric patients with MS who presented most commonly with either pure sensory symptoms or optic neuritis [Duquette et al., 1987] . Diplopia, pure motor symptoms, abnormal gait including ataxia (cerebellar or vestibular), mixed sensory and motor symptoms, and sphincter disturbances were also reported. In 1992, Sindern et al. identified 31 patients with MS using Poser's criteria (see Diagnosis section) who presented before the age of 16 years and compared them to 72 sex-matched control patients diagnosed with MS between the ages of 20 and 40 years [Sindern et al., 1992] . The most common finding at the onset of disease for both children and adults was optic neuritis, accounting for 52% and 40%, respectively. The second most common presenting symptom in children was sensory disturbance, seen in 16% of children and 15% of adults. Transverse myelitis was more common in children, whereas motor symptoms were more common in adults (18%) than in children (6%). Furthermore, in 71% of children, the initial presentation was rapid, resulting in admission to the hospital within a few hours to days. A longitudinal study by Boiko et al. confirmed Duquette's and Sindern' s findings that sensory symptoms and optic neuritis were the most common initial manifestations in patients with the clinical onset of MS before the age of 16 years [Boiko et al., 2002] . In 1995, Poser et al. characterized the presentation of MS in adults (Table 1) [Poser, 1995] , and the diagnosis of MS should be considered in children presenting with similar symptoms.",

The remainder of patients has a lymphocytic pleocytosis (typically \u03fd50 cells/mm 3 ) and/or elevated protein (typically \u03fd75 mg/dL) [Dale et al., 2000] . Intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin (Ig), predominantly IgG, is also seen in patients with MS. Approximately 80% of children with MS have increased CSF IgG synthesis [Jones, 2003] . Furthermore, oligoclonal bands (OCB), markers of antibody synthesis in the CNS, are present in about 85-95% of adult patients with MS [Olek and Dawson, 2004] . In children, OCB were present in 40 -87% of patients and may appear later during disease convalescence or relapse [Sindern et al., 1992; Selcen et al., 1996; Dale et al., 2000; Jones, 2003 ]. OCB are not specific to MS [Poser, 1983; Olek and Dawson, 2004] .

At least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion or nine T2 hyperintense lesions if there is no gadolinium-enhancing lesion 2. At least one infratentorial lesion 3. At least one juxtacortical lesion 4. At least three periventricular lesions There are two ways to show dissemination in time: 1. Detection of gadolinium enhancement at least three months after the onset of the initial clinical event, if not at the site corresponding to the initial event 2. Detection of a new T2 lesion if it appears at any time compared with a reference scan done at least 30 days after the onset of the initial clinical event Note: A spinal cord lesion can be considered equivalent to a brain infratentorial lesion, an enhancing spinal cord lesion is considered to be equivalent to an enhancing brain lesion, and individual spinal cord lesions can contribute together with individual brain lesions to reach the required number of T2 lesions.

In ADEM, a repeat MRI scan performed more than two months after the onset of symptoms often shows partial or complete resolution of lesions with no new lesions. Enhancement after the administration of gadolinium can be seen on the initial scan; however, no lesions enhance on the follow-up MRI in ADEM. In MS, both new and enhancing lesions may be present when the scan is repeated, although the time to develop new lesions is unpredictable. In the absence of clinical symptoms, new findings on MRI are useful in differentiating MS from ADEM. MDEM presents a challenging dilemma in diagnosing childhood-onset MS. The clinical presentation, laboratory data, and neuroimaging features of MDEM resemble ADEM, both of which are monophasic illnesses. However, patients with MDEM have a clinical relapse after their initial illness or develop new lesions on MRI, suggestive of a chronic demyelinating disease or MS. Despite the presence of new lesions on MRI, suggesting dissemination in time, some investigators believe that MDEM and MS are separate entities. A diagnosis of MDEM should be reserved for patients whose relapses are caused by the same trigger responsible for the inciting event and occur shortly after presentation or within two months of discontinuing steroids [Dale et al., 2000] .",

Linkage and twin studies demonstrate that individuals carry a genetic susceptibility to this disease [Rice, 2004] . A susceptibility locus for MS has been identified on chromosome 6, specifically the major histocompatability complex (MHC) class II alleles human leukocyte antigens (HLA) DR15 and DQ6. This association is seen in all populations. In Sardinians, there is an additional association with DR4, and, in Turks, there is an association with DR2 and DR4. In Finns, there is an association of MS with myelin basic protein (chromosome 18); however, neither this association nor an association with any other myelin genes has been noted in non-Finnish populations [Kenealy et al., 2003] . Aside from the MHC locus, other regions of interest identified from the United Kingdom study for MS susceptibility are located on chromosomes 1, 5, 6p, 7p, 14q, 17q, 19q, and Xp [Chataway et al., 1998] . Some of the genes in these regions include tumor necrosis factor [TNF]\u2423, interleukin [IL]-1Ra, IL-4, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4).",

For some time, an infectious agent has been suspected in triggering an autoimmune response. This theory was supported by apparent epidemics that occurred in the Faroe Islands and Iceland following World War II [Rice, 2004] . Additional support for an infectious etiology was provided by further studies that showed elevated antiviral titers (measles, rubella, mumps, varicella/zoster, EBV, influenza/parainfluenza,coronavirus, HTLV-1, Borna, etc) in the CSF of MS patients during an acute exacerbation [ Sibley et al., 1985; Panitch, 1994] . Presumably, the elevated titers represent nonspecific activation of B cells in the nervous system. In addition, the MS literature is replete with the isolation of viruses from the brains of patients with MS including measles, coronavirus, retroviruses, HTLV-1, HHV-6, and scrapie agent. Current focus on infectious agents includes EBV, HHV-6, endogenous retroviruses such as HERV-W, and Chlamydia pneumoniae [Johnson and Major, 2003] .",

In demyelinating lesions, T H 1 cytokines, such as interferon \u2425, TNF-\u2423, and IL-2, are expressed by these leukocytes. The chemokine profile also suggests a T H 1-mediated inflammatory process. Nevertheless, MS is likely to be more than a purely T H 1-mediated disease because it is likely that CD4 cells, macrophages, B cells, and a paucity of regulatory T cells also play a role [Merrill, 1992; Sorensen et al., 1999; Frohman et al., 2006] .",

The goal of any disease-altering therapy is to prevent longterm disability which evolves over many years [Goodin et al., 2002] . The efficacy of the newer therapies has predominantly been studied over a short time period. Moreover, the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) that is used as an outcome measure in adult studies has not been validated for use in children. Children with MS may have cognitive dysfunction, which has not been evaluated as an outcome measure, although the MS functional composite (MSFC) places some weight on mental functioning. Once again, the utility of this scale has not been established in children. Currently, most studies use the short-term attack rate as an outcome measure as well as MRI data to assess T2 disease burden, cerebral atrophy, and the appearance of T1 black holes. Although there are very few trials that have included children, in this article we review therapies that are recommended for adults and, where data is available, highlight the pediatric studies.",

They suppress the immune system in many ways, such as altering cytokine profiles, inhibiting the synthesis of matrix metalloproteinases, and reducing CSF antibodies to MBP and OCB [Kupersmith et al., 1994] . In 1970, a multicenter trial compared adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (80 U/day given intramuscularly [IM] for four days with a 7-day taper) against placebo in 197 patients with acute MS [Rose et al., 1970] . After four weeks, the authors found that ACTH accelerated clinical improvement, although there was no significant difference in the outcome. In another study, ACTH (80 U/day for one week followed by a taper) was compared with 1 g of IV methylprednisolone for three days. In this study, there was no significant difference between the two treatment arms [Thompson et al., 1989] . Subsequently, a number of studies have been published using glucocorticoids for optic neuritis, most notably the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial. This multicenter study compared IV methylprednisolone for three days followed by oral prednisone for 11 days against a 14-day course of oral prednisone and a placebo group. For both primary (visual fields and contrast sensitivity) and secondary (visual acuity and color vision) endpoints, the group that received IV methylprednisolone had an accelerated recovery of visual function compared to the placebo group. The rate of recovery for the group receiving oral prednisone was in between the IV and placebo groups. At six months, there was no difference between the treated and the placebo groups [Beck, 1988] . Furthermore, the group receiving oral steroids had an increased number of recurrences of optic neuritis. In addition to their use in optic neuritis, high-dose ste-roids are also known to enhance the resolution of gadolinium-positive MRI lesions [Barkhof et al., 1991; Burnham et al., 1991] . Finally, abrupt discontinuation of steroids can lead to severe clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic relapses; therefore, an oral taper is recommended. Although these studies were performed in young adults with RRMS and CIS, IV steroids (15-30 mg/kg/day given daily for 3-5 days followed by an oral taper over 14 days) are used in children with acute attacks that impair function.",

In addition, they may cause a shift from a T H 1 to a T H 2 response. In adultonset MS, IFN-\u2424 has a beneficial effect on the clinical and radiological outcome measures. Because the drug is not marketed for the pediatric population, there are no recommendations available for dosing children. For older children and adolescents, adult doses are most often used. Interferon \u2424-1a (INF\u2424-1a) is available in a weekly IM injection (Avonex, 30 g) or a subcutaneous (SC) injection given three times a week (Rebif, 22 g or 44 g). Interferon \u2424-1b (INF\u2424-1b, Betaseron, 8 million international units (MIU) or 250 g) is given SC every other day. For smaller teens or children younger than 10 years, the doses are often adjusted to minimize adverse events and increase tolerability, such as starting with a half-dose of Avonex or Betaseron or using the lower dose for Rebif.",

Sixty-five cases were reviewed. The majority was treated with Avonex (38), followed by Rebif (18), Betaseron (16), and Copaxone (9). Relapses were defined as the occurrence of new symptoms lasting more than 24 hr with objective findings of CNS involvement in a previously unaffected patient or the acute worsening of preexisting symptoms lasting more than 24 hr and causing an increase of at least 1 on the EDSS. All four of the drugs substantially reduced the relapse rate with combined data showing a decrease from 2.8 to 0.5 relapses per year and similar results for the individual medications. The change in EDSS was not significantly different when comparing the first and last visit in the INF\u2424 subgroups; however, a statistically significant difference was seen in the GA subgroup (baseline: 1.1 \u03ee 0.5, posttreatment: 0.6 \u03ee 0.5, P \u03ed 0.007).

Although natalizumab had significant short-term beneficial effects, unfortunately, three patients who received this drug developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The relative risk of developing PML in MS patients on natalizumab is 1 in 1,000 [Ropper, 2006 ]. Moreover, the use of this drug may have other long-term effects, such as unmasking latent viral infections as well as other diseases that are dampened by immune surveillance. In children who have a malignant course of MS, the use of this drug on a short-term basis may be warranted.",

            "text": "In acute MS plaques, there is clearcut evidence for remyelination; however, this is minimal in chronic lesions. The recruitment of oligodendrocyte precursor cells to areas of demyelination is mediated via chemokine and cytokine receptors, a pathway that appears to be intact. Once attracted to areas of damage, these precursor cells recapitulate the differentiation process; however, full differentiation of these cells may be dampened by macromolecules that are negative regulators of this process, such as activation of the Notch pathway due to reexpression of the ligand Jagged or the Nogo receptor interacting protein. In the future, both of these targets may be sites for therapeutic intervention that will aid the process of remyelination. In addition, transplantation of stem cells or oligodendroglial progenitor cells may be a consideration [John et al., 2002; Mi et al., 2005; Frohman et al., 2006 ].",

            "text": "MS is best recognized for its relapsing and remitting clinical course. In fact, in both children and adults, RRMS is the most common form, followed by the secondary and primary progressive forms. However, the prognosis for pediatric MS remains controversial. The EDSS has been used to quantify the disability associated with MS by assigning a functional score for multiple systems (pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel and bladder, visual, and cerebral) [Kurtzke, 1983] . Patients with a score of 0 have a normal neurological exam. Scores between 1.0 and 3.5 are fully ambulatory, whereas 4.0 -5.5 are ambulatory for short distances without aid or rest. Patients with scores greater than 6 require assistance with ambulation as well as other activities of daily living. In 2002, Boiko et al. compared the time to EDSS of 3.0 (mild disability in at least three domains or moderate disability in one area) and 6.0 (requiring intermittent or constant unilateral assistance to walk 100 meters with or without resting) in adult-and pediatric-onset MS [Boiko et al., 2002] . On average, adults had a 50% risk of reaching EDSS scores of 3.0 and 6.0 in 10 and 18 years, respectively, after onset whereas disability in children was much slower, taking 23 and 28 years, respectively. In addition, 53.1% of children with RRMS progressed to SPMS after an average of 17.7 years (SD 1.17 years). The 50% risk for conversion from RRMS to SPMS was 23 years in children, whereas it was 10 years in adults. Although this data suggests a slower disease course in children, the overall morbidity is typically greater when children reach adulthood. Children have higher EDSS scores when compared to adults with MS of the same age [Ghezzi et al., 2005] .",

Despite significant advances in neuroimaging, MS remains a clinical diagnosis. New guidelines allow earlier diagnosis, but they have not been reliably established in children, especially those younger than 10 years of age. In addition, these guidelines may not be sufficient to prevent the inclusion of monosymptomatic demyelinating disorders, which do not require long-term treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment with immunomodulatory agents are critical to reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Although these drugs have been used in practice, more data is needed on long-term tolerability, side effects, and overall efficacy in the pediatric population. f",
