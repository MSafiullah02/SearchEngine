Due to achievements like vaccination and antimicrobial drugs, many infectious diseases can now be prevented or controlled. Most striking in this respect is the development of a vaccine against smallpox, a lethal virus that globally claimed millions of lives. Although the vaccination procedure was already developed in the 18th century, it lasted until the end of the 20th century before the world was declared smallpox\u2010free. Based on this success, there was great confidence that viral infections could be conquered definitely, either by vaccination or by antiviral drug treatment. Inspired by these successes, the US Surgeon General William Stewart stated in 1967 that \u201cThe time has come to close the book on infectious diseases\u201d. Unfortunately, the future has shown otherwise.",

For this, immune cells are equipped with different groups of receptors, which are able to sense microbial intruders including viruses. These pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are fundamentally different from host structures. One of the first discovered and best characterized PRRs are the Toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs) 7, 8, 9, 10, which are mostly present on antigen\u2010presenting cells like macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) 8, 9, but also on non\u2010immune cells like fibroblasts and epithelial cells 10. These transmembrane receptors are located on the cell surface or at the endosome 7, 9, 10, 11. The cell surface\u2010located TLRs recognize mainly lipids and proteins from bacteria and yeasts 10. Viruses, on the other hand, are intracellular parasites, which may explain the endosomal localization of the viral nucleic acid\u2010recognizing TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 (Figure 1) 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Also, this endosomal location of the TLRs probably serves to ensure tolerance for \u201cself\u201d molecules and to promote ligand accessibility 10, 14. Interestingly, in addition to the well\u2010known lipopolysaccharides from Gram\u2010negative bacteria, cell surface TLRs have also been associated with viral recognition. TLR4 has been shown to recognize the fusion protein of RSV 10, 20. Likewise, next to the recognition of Gram\u2010positive bacteria, TLR2 is involved in detection of various DNA viruses like HSV1 and 2, measles virus, vaccinia virus, and CMV 21, 22, 23. Interstingly, this TLR2\u2010dependent detection seems to be regulated especially by monocytes 21, 22, 24.",

Although RIG\u2010I can respond to both positive and negative strand RNA viruses, MDA5 senses mainly picornaviruses like rhinovirus and poliovirus 29, 30. Earlier data suggested that MDA5 preferentially binds long dsRNA (picornaviruses), whereas shorter fragments of dsRNA and other specific nucleotide sequences are sensed by RIG\u2010I 30, 31. However, some viruses can be detected by both receptors 29. Also, the recently discovered receptor DAI is important for intracellular detection of viral DNA 32, 33.",

The acidic environment disassembles the virus, and viral nucleic acids are subsequently recognized by TLR7 or TLR9 50, 51. Ultimately, massive amounts of type I IFN are produced. In contrast to cDCs and non\u2010immune cells, in pDCs the TLRs contribute significantly more to viral recognition than the cytoplasmic PRRs RIG\u2010I and MDA5 26, 52, 53.

In cDCs, viral components stimulate the TLRs (apart from the cytoplasmic PRRs) resulting in phosphorylation of interferon\u2010regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). IRF3 is essential for the production of proinflammatory cytokines and IFN\u03b2 (the first wave IFN) and is constitutively expressed, not only in cDCs but in most cell types 10, 54. Next, because of autocrine or paracrine signaling through the interferon\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR), IRF7 is activated, leading to the production of all type I IFNs including the various IFN\u03b1 subtypes (the second wave IFN) 55, 56. Alternatively, in pDCs IRF7 is constitutively expressed and activated immediately after stimulation of TLR7 or TLR9, and thus no prior phosphorylation of IRF3 or autocrine/paracrine signaling is required (Figure 1) 48, 52, 57, 58, 59, 60.

Yet, the cDC is indispensable for clearance of a viral infection. This can be illustrated by the function of TLR8 expressed by cDCs. This receptor is similar to TLR7 in pDCs and also recognizes viral ssRNA. Interestingly, stimulation of TLR8 on cDCs and TLR7 on pDCs results in entirely different responses 63. Although the pDC produces mainly IFN\u03b1, the cDC induces a pro\u2010inflammatory profile in which nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB) is activated for the production of TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20106 64. More importantly, IL\u201012 is produced (Figure 1). This cytokine augments the cytolytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells and also induces the production of the immunoregulatory cytokine IFN\u03b3 by T and NK cells 65. Thus, although both DC subsets use different antiviral pathways, they are certainly not mutually exclusive in their response to viral infection. Because of their different cytokine patterns, pDCs and cDCs respond collaboratively to viral infection and connect innate and adaptive immunity 66. Communication and cooperation between these two DC subsets are vital to induce appropriate immune responses towards invading pathogens.",

A typical example of a combination of efficient inhibition of the type I IFN response together with an exaggerated immune response is provided by the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza strain. The non\u2010structural 1 (NS1) protein of H5N1 is an effective antagonist of the type I IFN pathway 100, 101, 102. This results not only in high viral replication but also in an inflammatory response characterized by high levels of cytokines like TNF\u03b1 103. This \u201chypercytokinemia\u201d or \u201ccytokine storm\u201d results in excessive infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lungs 103, 104, 105, 106. Also, higher plasma levels of inflammatory mediators were detected in deceased H5N1 patients compared with survivors 107. The deregulation of type I IFN by H5N1 is also observed in the highly virulent 1918 H1N1 influenza strain and the Ebola and Marburg viruses 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, in which both viral and immune pathology result in severe disease 6. Thus, the increased resistance to the antiviral effects of IFN enhances viral replication and evokes an aberrant proinflammatory response characterized by high levels of cytokines and chemokines, which induces the pulmonary injury observed in H5N1 patients.",

HIV infection results in progressive immune deficiency, impaired adaptive responses, low CD4 T cell counts and increases susceptibility to opportunistic infections. One of the earliest findings during the AIDS epidemic was a deficient IFN\u03b1 production in HIV\u2010infected patients. Next to a lower number of IFN\u2010producing cells, also each cell produced less IFN\u03b1 in response to HIV 113, 114. The decrease in IFN\u03b1 can be due to the Vpr protein of HIV, which strongly inhibits type I IFN production by pDCs 115. In addition, the effects of IFN\u03b1 are antagonized by the HIV protein Vpu, which induces degradation of the restriction factor BST2 79, 116. However, during the chronic phase of HIV infection, it is hypothesized that IFN\u03b1 contributes to the decline of the immune system by inducing apoptosis of CD4 T cells. Because of the non\u2010infectious interaction between the HIV\u2010bound gp120 protein and the CD4 receptor on pDCs, IFN\u03b1 is produced and this results in killing (possibly by pDCs) of uninfected CD4 T cells 114, 115, 116, 117. Thus, although apoptosis of infected cells is usually a protective mechanism to prevent viral spread 118, 119, here, it results in a distinct advantage for the virus due to the decreased immune control by CD4 T cells.",

Although this therapy is effective in nearly 50% of the cases, the administration of pegylated IFN\u03b1 is associated with severe side effects 120, 121, 122. Normally, during viral infections, type I IFN gives the \u201csick\u2010signal\u201d that results in fever. Patients treated with type I IFN have to endure these feverish periods for prolonged periods of time.
