Spatial risk did not correspond precisely to population-based rates of positive tests. The strongest univariate association with positive testing rates was the proportion of residents in a ZIP Code Tabulation Area with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). For every one unit increase in a scaled standardized measure of COPD in a community, there was an approximate 8-fold increase in the risk of a positive COVID-19 test in a ZCTA (Incidence Density Ratio = 8.2, 95% Credible Interval 3.7, 18.3). The next strongest association was with the proportion of Black and African American residents, for which there was a nearly five-fold increase in the risk of a positive COVID-19 test. (IDR = 4.8, 95% Cr I 2.4, 9.7). Increases in the proportion of residents older than 65, housing density and the proportion of residents with heart disease were each associated with an approximate doubling of risk. In a multivariable model including estimates for age, COPD, heart disease, housing density and Black/African American race, the only variables that remained associated with positive COVID-19 testing with a probability greater than chance were the proportion of Black/African American residents and proportion of older persons.",

            "text": "The SARS-Cov-2 virus poses unprecedented clinical and public health challenges world-wide. While much of the attention has been rightfully focused on the clinical aspects of the disease, epidemiological studies and prevention research are becoming of increasing importance, particularly as no effective therapeutic has yet been identified. 1 Epidemiological and populationbased studies can contribute to the identification of patient risk factors for disease severity. Recent studies of observational registry data have found COVID-19 mortality to be independently associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) (Odds Ratio (OR) for mortality=2.7, 95% CI 2.1, 3.5), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR =3.0; 95% CI, 2.0 to 4.4), and age greater than 65 years (OR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.6 to 2.4). 2 In one case series, 68% of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 ICU patients had at least one comorbidity, of which hypertension was most common. 3 Not all comorbidities, however, are physiologic. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage communities across the United States and the world, attention is increasingly turning to population-level demographic, socioeconomic, racial and environmental risk factors for COVID-19. Blacks/African Americans have been reported to contract and die from COVID-19 at higher rates than others. 4 In Chicago, a large number of COVID-19 deaths are concentrated in five largely black neighborhoods. 5 A similar mortality concentration among Black/African American persons has been reported in New Orleans. 6 At the built-environmental level, drivers of disease include population density 7 and housing density, with urban counties in the US having the highest COVID-19 death rates. 8 Few regions of the US have been more grievously affected than the five boroughs of New York City. A neighborhood-level analysis of New York City found higher rates of COVID-19 disease in areas with higher population shares of Black/African American and Hispanic persons, and in areas with higher population density. 9 While it certainly is possible that those affected have higher rates of underlying health conditions that may increase their susceptibility to the virus, the authors speculate that \"residents of these neighborhoods are less likely to be able to work from home, disproportionately rely on public transit during the crisis, are less likely to have internet access,\" and \"have higher rates of overcrowding at the household level.\"",

The probability of spatial risk greater than 2 (PrK L M > 1P) was calculated. As originally described by Clayton and Bernardinelli, 18 these exceedance probabilities are the posterior probabilities for an area's spatial risk estimate exceeding some pre-set value. This was extended by Richardson, et al 19 to decision rules \"for classifying whether (an area) has an increased risk based on how much of the posterior distribution of the relative risk parameter \u2026 exceeds a reference threshold\". 20 They are calculated as the proportion of simulations for which the linear combination of effects ( ) exceeds the target value. Lastly, the proportion of spatially explained variance was calculated as the proportion of total spatial heterogeneity accounted for by the spatially structured conditional autoregression variance. 17 .

But perhaps the more unexpected finding is that when Black/African American race and COPD are entered into the same multivariable model, it is race that appears to be the stronger predictor.

And, it may be that disparities may vary depending in part on how well-established Hispanic communities are within cities and states. 25 The question of why COVID-19 affects one community more severely than another may provide clues to crucial questions about who is a risk and why. 26 Our study indicates place is important. We find about a third of the variance in a simple spatial model can be accounted for by place. We found risk to be approximately doubled by environmental characteristics like population and housing density.

It could be that Black/African American race is a proxy for underlying physiological risks. There are preliminary reports that infection with SARS-Cov-2 may be associated with the A blood group, 27 and that severe COVID-19 is driven in part by coagulopathies that may be associated with Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor, 28 although the relationship of such factors with race is complex. 29 Race may also be associated with exposure. By one account, 80% of non-medical staff in New York City's hard-hit public hospitals are Black/African American or Hispanic, compared to less than half of doctors and nurses. It may be that their risk of exposure to SARS-Cov-2 compared to their clinical colleagues has been underestimated. 30 Our results indicate that kind of exposure risk may be the more critical factor than underlying health conditions. That a risk like COPD should drop from a level of 8 to non-significance when race is included in the model may point to something beyond physiological risk of infection. Placing risk factors in context, both within and across populations, may be key. Differences between New York City vs Chicago as a whole appear to influence the relative strength of associations between population-level demographic variables and testing outcomes. 23 It will be increasingly important to conduct such comparative studies.",

            "text": "Our results should be interpreted cautiously. Ecological studies can offer a view of disease processes in a community, but it may be a fractured view. Measures like school density and social fragmentation may not be measuring what we think they are measuring; the number of schools in an area, rather than acting as a disease multiplier, may be a measure of the strength of the tax base. Similarly, the Congdon Index treats empty houses as a measure of disorder, but this has a very different meaning in the setting of a rapidly-spreading infectious disease. The proportion of non-English speakers in a given ZCTA may be biased by a lack of self-reporting by undocumented immigrants. And, as in any ecologic study, it is not certain that the persons with the risk factor being studied are those who are developing the outcome. SARS-Cov-2 testing results are imperfect, with numbers likely to be biased by the availability of testing. But, we would expect that bias, to be in the direction of increased counts in areas with higher socioeconomic status. Consistent with our findings, a recent geographic analysis reported that persons in poorer NYC neighborhoods were less likely to be tested but once tested were more likely to test positive. 22 It is partly for this reason, we chose to base most of our analyses on the proportion of positive tests, rather than the population-based rates of positive tests, an approach taken by others. 22 Despite these caveats, it is difficult to overlook the interplay of race and COVID-19. Race appears to be an indicator of risk independent of social status, income, built environment or even underlying health. This has implications not only for justice and equity, but for an effective response to the pandemic. 25 .
