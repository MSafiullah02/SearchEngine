As 279 an example, the COVID-19 ID Now system, discussed above, uses nicking enzyme 280 amplification reaction (NEAR) isothermic amplification chemistry to reverse transcribe 281 and exponentially amplify a small region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The system uses 282 two sequence-specific templates (primers) and three enzymes (a thermostable DNA 283 polymerase, a reverse transcriptase, and a thermostable nicking endonuclease) as well 284 as fluorescently-labeled molecular beacons to detect the virus-derived amplicon. 14 285 286 Unlike a traditional RT-PCR test which utilizes a positive control human gene (extraction 287 control), the ID Now system does not report out whether a given sample contained 288 sufficient sample-derived RNA to be valid. As a point of care test, it has a low 289 throughput (1 sample every 13 minutes vs 96 to 384 samples per run for RT-PCR in 290 ~90min), but does not require transport of the sample to a clinical laboratory, ID Now system does, however, have an impressive reported limit of detection 293 (LOD), claimed by the manufacturer to be 125 genome equivalents per ml. For 294 comparison, the commercially available Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) RT-PCR kit 295 has a LOD of 100 copies/ml. The BGI kit utilizes the Chinese CDC Orf1ab 296 primers/probe with an RNA extraction control targeting the human B actin gene. (Figure 297 1) Of note, the Chinese CDC protocol provided to the World Health Organization targets 298 two genes (Orf1ab and N), but the BGI kit targets only one viral gene. Surprisingly, the 299 US CDC kit has a significantly higher LOD at 1000 copies /ml, but this is partially 300 because of the kit's more stringent criteria for generating a positive result.

Flocked swabs are often more effective for sample collection than 464 cotton, rayon or Dacron swabs, and cotton-tipped swabs may also contain ingredients 465 that inhibit PCR testing. 466 Utilizing appropriate technique during sample acquisition is paramount to ensure 467 accurate results. Inappropriate sampling may lead to insufficient sample volume or type 468 and may result in false negative results. 25 The CDC recommends obtaining 469 nasopharyngeal specimens by inserting the sterile swab through the nares, confirming 470 the swab is parallel to the palate. Appropriate depth of insertion equals the distance 471 from the nostrils to the outer opening of the ear. Encountering resistance after insertion 472 can also indicate suitable contact with the nasopharynx. The swab is then rolled and 473 kept in place for several seconds to allow absorption of secretions. 26 These samples 474 should only be obtained by medical professionals, with proper PPE in place. 475 Additionally, false negative results may be received if the sample is improperly handled, 476or if the patient is no longer actively shedding viral particles.477For most RT-PCR based tests a transport media is required. For those, the CDC has 478 designated viral transport media/universal transport media (VTM/UTM) as the preferred 479 transport media, however other transport media or lab-created media are likely also 480 acceptable. Specimens should be evaluated rapidly, however storage for up to 72 hours 481 at 4 degrees Celsius is approved. There is limited data regarding freezing specimens, 482 and stability should be assessed before use if the specimen was frozen. Recent RT-483 PCR point-of-care tests, e.g. Abbott's ID NOW test discussed above requires that 484 sample swab be placed directly on the sample receiver. Antibody-based tests require a 485 serum sample obtained from a finger prick or a venipuncture.486Test specimens are to be obtained by a health care worker and no self-testing is487 available. This creates an interdependence of testing with health care workers where 488 increasing the number of tests utilizes scarce resources of health care workers and the 489 required personal protection equipment. On the other hand, one of the main benefits of 490 testing is to protect health care workers from exposure to undiagnosed infected 491 persons. On April 21, 2020, the FDA re-issued the EUA for the Laboratory Corporation 492 of America (LabCorp) COVID-19 RT-PCR Test to permit testing of self-collected nasal 493 swab samples by patients at home using LabCorp's Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 Test 494 home collection kit. This kit is different in that the swab used for sample collection is number of studies have compared the timing of detection of the viral DNA, and 498 the timing of seroconversion with the course of the illness starting with the incubation 499 period and during convalescence. 12 Figure 2 depicts the relationship among the three 500 factors. It is important to note that the yield of the tests compared to the stage of the 501 illness also depend on how mild or severe the illness is, which introduces a fourth factor 502 in these analyses. As of the time of submission of this manuscript, the RT-PCR based 503 tests continue to be used for diagnosis of infection after onset of symptoms and in 504 evaluating contacts of confirmed patients in the process of contact tracing. Repeat 505 testing by RT-PCR based tests after resolution of symptoms may be used to determine 506 when a patient is no longer contagious. Several issues need to be taken into 507 consideration. The duration of viral shedding can be prolonged and is also related to the 508 severity of the illness. Detection of viral fragments by the test may give a false positive 509 test. The use of RT-PCR based tests for epidemiologic surveillance requires well 510 designed prospective studies. 511 One study looked at PCR based tests for surveillance of non-symptomatic persons. Two 512 New York hospitals implemented universal SARS-CoV-2 screening utilizing PCR-based 513 testing from nasopharyngeal specimens from pregnant women upon admission for 514 delivery of their infant. In these asymptomatic obstetric patients, 13.7% were positive for 515 the SARS-Co-V-2 virus. The authors suggest that universal screening may allow for 516 improved isolation and PPE practices. 27 517 Serologic tests are not recommended to be used for diagnosis of the infection because 518 the timing of the appearance of IgM and IgG is variable and may be delayed. They are 519 also related to the severity of the infection, with higher IgG levels in more severe 520 infections. 22 Serologic tests can be used in epidemiologic studies and surveillance as 521 well as identifying patients who can become convalescent serum donors for 522 experimental treatment protocols. 523 Roadblocks to Testing 524 While all these tests and others have received EUAs, the consensus is that testing has 525 not been as available as needed for the rapid diagnosis of symptomatic patients and for 526 the detection of the infection in mildly symptomatic people or the asymptomatic contacts 527 of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. This has resulted from multifactorial issues 528 ranging from overwhelming the commercial laboratories to exhausting limited supplies 529 of swabs, transport media, reagents and cartridges/kits for platform instruments needed 530 for the assays. A potential strategy is to move the testing to 'in house' laboratories 531 residing within hospitals and medical institutions. Currently, there are no national data 532 on the turnaround time of testing, so we present here our experience at CCHMC, 533 Cincinnati, Ohio. We tracked the time it took for COVID-19 test results to return since March 16, 2020. The longest turnaround was for samples collected on March 21, 202. A 535 total of 14 samples that day had an average turnaround of 13.1 days. The 25th, 50th, 536 75th percentiles were 12.2 days, 13.6 days, 13.7 days, respectively. This meant that a 537 patient suspected of COVID disease would have been infectious for a long duration 538 prior to confirmation of the infection, resulting in difficulty in managing contacts. The first 539 reduction in turnaround time was seen for samples collected on March 31, 2020, when 540 a second external laboratory was contracted to perform the test. The second reduction 541 in turnaround time was seen for samples collected on April 5, 2020. The remarkable 542 decrease in the turn-around time occurred on April 13, 2020 after testing started in-543 house with a turn-around time of a few hours to a maximum of 24 hours and further 544 decrease noted thereafter when the Abbott ID NOW was used to test patients 545 immediately prior to surgical procedures.

            "text": "560at higher risk of complications if infected. Lowest priority is given to groups such as 561 other critical workers or other individuals who are symptomatic, asymptomatic 562 healthcare workers or first responders or those living in communities with high 563 hospitalization rates secondary to SARS-Cov-2 in an effort to protect healthcare 564 workers and reduce spread of the virus through communities. The CDC recommends 565 that asymptomatic persons are not given priority for testing. The difficulties in obtaining 566 an adequate number of tests has led hospitals and institutions to create algorithms to 567 prioritize which patients need to be tested. CCHMC has assembled a committee with 568 representation from clinical divisions and has generated three tiers of testing included 569 as an example of the local application of the testing guidance(Table 7). The principle 570 behind the guidance is to suit the availability of tests to the areas of highest need based 571 on the experience gained to date from the behavior and course of the pandemic in other 572 countries. The WHO guidelines prioritize the vulnerable populations, health care 573 workers and those in closed environments who are most likely to be infected. The CDC 574 guidance prioritizes symptomatic individuals in similar tiers as the WHO and guides 575 against testing of asymptomatic individuals. The CCHMC guidance prioritizes testing for 576 patients who are at highest risk of getting the infection, patients who are at risk of 577 complications and hence may benefit from available therapies, which are mostly 578 experimental at this time, and patients in whom a negative test is necessary prior to 579 proceeding with critical procedures. The tiers reflect the testing priorities of the CDC and 580 WHO, to assist clinicians with testing decision making. Priority is given to symptomatic 581 inpatients who are immunocompromised, reside in a long-term care facility, depend on 582 respiratory technology, are less than 1 year of age, or those who develop symptoms 583 after hospital admission. Testing is also recommended for inpatients with two or more 584 SARS-CoV-2 specific symptoms without an alternative unifying diagnosis, symptomatic585 oncology patients evaluated in the emergency department or other asymptomatic higher 586 risk populations. These high-risk asymptomatic groups include those pre-transplant 587 patients with an organ offer, patients receiving high-risk surgical procedures, 588 chemotherapy or bone marrow transplant, solid organ transplant patients with acute 589 rejection treated by biologic therapy or neonates from a SARS-CoV-2 positive mother. 590 Numbers of tests, locations and outcomes: 591 According to the COVID-19 tracking project, and as of May 13, 2020, the number of 592 tests performed was approximately ten million tests ( 9,974,831) with close to 1.4 million 593 ( 1,382,304) positive at a cumulative rate of 13.6% positivity. 29 Tests are conducted at 594 public health, clinical and commercial laboratories. According to data on the CDC 595 website, up to May 1rst, 2020, of the 676,488 tests done at public health laboratories, 596 396,585at clinical laboratories and 3,809,190 at commercial laboratories, the percent 597 positive is 15.7% and 10.2% and 18.0%, respectively. 30 598 Discussion: 599 Despite the surge in the number of laboratories and institutions offering testing, there 600 remains a need for increased testing capacity. There is yet no available data on what 601 the indications were for the already performed tests in order to relate the pre-test probability with the outcome of the test, whether positive or negative. Per guidance, only 603 symptomatic persons were tested, however, the degree of adherence to the guidance is 604 not known. 605 There are multiple unresolved clinical issues surrounding the use of the COVID-19 606 diagnostics tests outlined above, ranging from technical limitations of each testing 607 modality to their utility for individual patient management and population-wide infection 608 control. NAT remain the most useful test for diagnosis of acute COVID-19 infections, 609 but have some clear limitation. NAT's currently available for clinical use do not 610 distinguish between functional / infectious (\"live\") and non-functional / non-infectious 611 viral RNA. These tests primarily quantify genomic viral RNA. Genomic viral RNA not 612 properly enveloped and packaged into an intact viral particle, however, is generally not 613 infectious, but can still be detected via NATs. This limitation makes clear demarcation 614 of when a specific patient is no longer infectious more difficult to determine. A recent 615 clinical report showed that COVID-19 patients who were serially tested for SARS-CoV-2 616 via RT-PCR could remain positive for 3-4 weeks or longer, well past the time when they 617 were symptomatic. 13 Whether these subjects remain contagious for as long as they are 618 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive is not entirely clear. Reassuringly, some emerging lines of 619 evidence (viral culture, viral gene transcription studies) suggest that active viral 620 shedding ceases after ~10-14 days of infection. Functional and nonfunctional SARS-621 Cov-2 viral particles can be distinguished from each other via viral culture techniques. In 622 a recent study \"live\" SARS-CoV-2 virus could not be cultured from patient sputum after 623 day 8 of symptoms. 12 Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 viral culture is labor/time intensive, 624 not easily scalable, and requires significant biosafety measures be in place (BSL-3 equipped lab per US CDC guidance). An alternative method to distinguish between live 626 and inactive viral RNA relies upon quantification of viral subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) 627 which are only transcribed within infected cells actively shedding viral particles. SARS-628 CoV-2 sgRNAs could be detected in patient sputum out to the 10 th symptomatic day, 629 while this signal disappeared at day 5 of symptoms in throat swab specimens, 630 suggesting that viral replication continues in the lower airway throughout the 2 nd week of 631 infection. 12 Taken together, current evidence would support quarantining SARS-CoV-2 632 subjects, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, for 2 weeks following onset of 633 symptoms. 634 As the pandemic progresses and more people are presumed recovered, the population 635 immunity and true surveillance can only be measured with antibody-based tests. As of 636 today only seven such tests have received EUA, however, multiple other tests are in 637 development in commercial laboratories and academic institutions. With the large 638 numbers of people needing antibody-based tests, the same hurdles may develop, in 639 addition to the lower sensitivity and specificity of those tests. The virus has several 640 different immune-dominant proteins (S and N proteins) and different antigens will likely 641 play different roles in the development of immunity; therefore knowledge of the 642 antibodies that will predict protection will have to be established. 643 In Conclusion: 644 Tests for COVID-19 disease have been instrumental in the management of the 645 pandemic. The utility of COVID19 testing has been diminished by limited resources 646 reducing the number of tests that could be offered in the face of a rapidly increasing 647 epidemic. There has been difficulty in extending the tests to the populations most in 648 need and possibly a lack of stringent application of the testing guidelines. It is the hope 649 that as the pandemic subsides, antibody-based tests would have a larger contribution to 650 the surveillance of the population and that the wider spread use of nucleic acid tests 651 would provide much needed data on the spread of the pandemic particularly in 652 vulnerable populations. It is also the hope that testing devices would move towards 653 point-of-care tests and possibly self-tests that would allow the continued monitoring of 654 the disease spread as well as facilitate preparedness for future recurrences of the 655 disease that are predicted.656",

Subsequently on February 29, 2020, an immediately in effect guidance policy was released by the FDA to assist with the 142 expansion of available tests and testing facilities throughout the United States. Since 143 this time and up to April 27, 2020, 48 unique tests were approved for use through the EUA, 41 tests are nucleic acid-based tests and 7 are antibody-based tests (Tables 1, 2 Additional Authorizations by States: To expand testing availability, states approved authorization of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified laboratories to develop and perform testing. The first such approval was given to the Wadsworth Center in New York on March 12, 2020. A Presidential memorandum followed on March 13, 2020 allowing other states to 151 authorize laboratories to develop and perform testing without EUA approval by the FDA. State authorization requires laboratories to follow state law, and state-specific 153 processes. The states of Connecticut, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, New York and Washington have utilized this pathway to allow laboratories in the state to implement 155 testing through a state-specific process.Additionally, on March 31, 2020, the FDA issued another EUA allowing use of molecular-based laboratory developed tests by a CLIA-approved developing laboratory.This directive broadened the scope of which entities could develop and utilize testing.This authorization restricts the use of the test to the laboratory where it was developed.Since this time, 21 academic hospital and commercial laboratories have been approved 161 to utilize their diagnostic testing. Each of these are nucleic-acid-based tests(Table 3).Lastly, the FDA has issued a policy allowing serologic testing to be developed and marketed by commercial manufacturers without application for an EUA. In these cases, the test must be validated, and the FDA notified that the test is in use. Many commercial 165 companies are currently utilizing serologic testing. Since the FDA issued the policy, over 166 70 test developers have notified the agency that they have serological tests available for 167 use.

            "text": "Additionally, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein shows much less cross-reactivity between SARS-Cov-2 and other coronavirus strains.17  These are more ideal protein targets for serologic testing. Currently available tests and prior serology research studies have utilized antibodies against the N protein, RBD or S protein. Still, all serology tests methodologies may lead to false positive results from acute infection with a different coronavirus due to some sequence similarities. Antibody-based testing evaluates for the presence of IgM and IgG specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in whole blood, plasma or serum.18,19  Anti-viral IgA antibodies were studied in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Studies showed that IgA antibodies targeting the S protein are detected from day 6-8 and up to 42 days with a peak at 20-22 days.18,20,21  However, at this time343 there are no commercial tests currently developed to measure anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgAs . The timing of the emergence of IgM and IgG specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID-19 illness has been described in few publications. 17,22 These indicate that IgM and IgG appear almost simultaneously and with an onset occurring approximately one week after the onset of first symptoms, similar to reports of antibody kinetics from SARS-CoV-1 infections. 23 Antibody titers vary by severity of symptoms, with levels being highest in the most severe infections. Thus it is not recommended to use serologic tests to confirm COVID-19 disease when the nucleic acid-based tests are negative in an attempt to confirm a diagnosis. Serologic tests have shown cross reactivity with other coronaviruses and can be seen in persons who were negative to SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR based tests and have had no symptoms of COVID-19 illness. While the serologic tests approved measure antibodies to the S and N viral proteins, not all such antibodies are neutralizing antibodies, hence may not be reliable in identifying persons who are protected from the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared to RT-PCR based tests, antibody-based tests have lower sensitivity and specificity. Negative results should be interpreted with caution, as negative serology does not definitively rule out an acute infection. Rapidity of development and length of persistence of specific antibodies are not fully described, and therefore presence of IgM or IgG may not indicate an active infection. Current infection is suspected with positive IgM and negative IgG, however current or recent infection may also be indicated with positive results for both IgM and IgG. Positive testing to IgG alone indicates recent or past infection. Results from serologic 365 testing should not be used in isolation. They should be combined with results from other laboratory tests including PCR-based tests and clinical history and presentation. It is still not known which antibodies will confer immunity and the duration of the immunity Seven laboratories have received EUA for an antibody-based test. testing procedure does not specify which epitopes on the 4 structural proteins of the virus (S, N, E and M) the detected patient-derived IgM and IgG bind. Per the manufacturer, the test performance as regards positive percent agreement and negative The DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG System manufactured by Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Inc is a rapid immunochromatographic test for recognition of IgM and IgG for SARS-Cov-2 utilizing the targeted N protein. False positive results may occur secondary to regards to negative percent agreement was 400/400. There was no demonstrated cross reactivity with other upper respiratory viral infections, although cross reactivity with alternative coronaviruses was not evaluated.The COVID-19 ELISA IgG Antibody Test manufactured at Mount Sinai is an ELISAthe RBD, followed by a confirmatory ELISA against the full S protein. Samples used for Given the large number of those tests being designed and utilized in public, commercial and academic institution laboratories, it will continue to be very difficult to assess and compare the tests performances and their place in the testing algorithms. that utilizes lateral flow technology. Antigen tests are very specific but are not sensitive, so a negative test in circumstances that suggest active infection need to be confirmed Each test's EUA specifies the sample on which the test can be run. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus resides in the upper and lower airways, the preferred location for obtaining these specimens is from the nasopharynx, which will represent the upper and lower replicates in the throat, hence throat swabs can be used for testing.12  In a publication that states that saliva can be collected for test, a review of the methods section suggests that the sample collected is sputum and that the use of the word saliva is a healthcare workers on COVID-19 wards. They compared SARS-CoV-2 detection from 450 patient-matched nasopharyngeal and saliva samples. They found that saliva yielded 451 greater detection sensitivity and consistency throughout the course of infection, and 452 self-sample collection of saliva have less variability than nasoparyngeal samples.24  The FDA has approved one test for saliva samples to be run only in the Rutgers Clinical",
