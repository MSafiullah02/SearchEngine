After a decline in the 1960s, cases again started to increase in the early 1970s reaching a peak in 1982 but remaining at levels of 5-6 000 cases per year till the end of the decade (16) . Since the vast majority of cases have been due to canine rabies, an extensive dog Evolutionary studies of lyssaviruses have tended to focus on the N protein, a well conserved structural protein, and the G protein which forms the envelope and capsid of the virus. The G protein contains domains responsible for host cell receptor recognition and membrane fusion and is the major target for the host neutralizing-antibody response (1) , and the G-L intergenic region or pseudogene (\u03a8) which is a noncoding region, highly variable, not subject to immunological selective pressure, and has therefore been used in studies of molecular epidemiology of the rabies virus (11) .

It is important to note that 98% of the people who died of rabies in China had not received any anti-rabies vaccine treatment and 70% of the people who died of rabies between 1996 and 2002 lived in Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces. There were 2 651 and 2 571 cases in 2004 and 2005, respectively, which suggest the new epidemic peak is coming. All warm-blooded mammals are susceptible to RABV infection, but dogs represent the major host of rabies virus in China. The main transmission route for rabies is canine bites. 95% rabies deaths are due to canine bites and rabid cats are responsible for 4% human cases in China. Increased dog populations and limited vacci-nation against rabies together with improved transportation may have resulted in this recent increase in rabies cases. The lyssavirus particle has a bullet-shaped form, 100-300 nm in length and 75 nm in diameter (7). The RABV genome consists of a single-stranded, unsegmented, negative-sense RNA of about 12 kb, which encodes five viral proteins (3'-N-P-M-G-L-5') and is contained in a bullet-shaped and bilayered envelope. The RNA polymerase(L) and phosphoprotein(P) complex with the nucleoprotein (N) form the nucleocapsid (NC), and the matrix protein(M) and the glycoprotein (G) form the inner and outer layers of the envelope, respectively.",

Percentage bootstrap values above 70% are shown at the branch nodes. mass vacci-nation of dogs in the epidemic regions, as has been successfully undertaken in certain countries of Latin Ame-rica(13), could virtually eliminate rabies, but the high cost of vaccines currently prevents this undertaking. The data reported here represent an early step in understanding the epidemiology of dog rabies in China. This knowledge will be important to future control efforts. According to the phylogenetic analysis of the G-L intergenic region in different rabies virus strains, all of the Chinese street isolates and the CTN vaccine strains of 7 generations were closely related but could be divided into two groups. The Chinese street isolates formed Group I, which was further divided into four lineages related to origins of distinct geographic regions. Inte-restingly, we recovered 15 RABV isolates from Fuyang and its surrounding area, and although the homology among these 15 isolates, which comprise lineage 1a, is very high, these isolates could still be further subdivided into several variants. Group II included CTN vaccine strains of different generations, which were originally isolated from Shangdong province in 1956 and became a vaccine strain through serial passages in mouse brain and human diploid cell(KMB-17). Group I and group II were closely related. A previous study on the N genes of Chinese strains has obtained similar phyloge-netic patterns(15). The G-L intergenic region in different rabies virus strains was highly variable and even the nucleotide numbers of this region were different. In Chinese street strains, this region had 519 nucleotides and only one transcription termination and one polyadenylation(PPT) motif. However, there were two transcription termination and two polyadenylation(PPT) motifs found in this region in the Pasteur strain derived from an 1882 French strain and the SAD strain derived from a 1935 U.S. rabies isolate (10) . The G-L intergenic region is a non-coding region, which is highly susceptible to random mutations, unrestricted by structure and function requirements or by immunological pressure. Being the most divergent region of the rabies genome, it might be more sensitive in demonstrating recent evolutionary events (9) . The CTN, PV and PM strains are the human vaccine strains currently used in China. The nucleotide homology between the CTN strains and the Chinese street strains was much higher(at least 12.3%) than that of any other vaccine strains. When the N and G Genes of the same vaccine strains and the same Chinese street strains were sequenced and analyzed, we obtained very similar phylogenetic trees(the data are not showed here and they will be published later). So it is possible that vaccines produced with the CTN vaccine strain might be more efficient than same time, we find that SAD, PV, HEP-Flury and PM vaccine strains have very high nucleotide homologies with South Korean, Indian, Canadian and Brazilian isolates. All these vaccine strains originated from America or Europe. For nearly half a century there was virtually no connection between China and South Korea and there is natural barrier between India and Tibet. These might explain the difference in the strains between China and South Korea or India.In conclusion, the findings from this study confirmed the fact that rabies viruses are genetically variable and the evolutions of different groups are apparently dominated by geographical influences. The nucleotide homology between the CTN vaccine strain and the Chinese street strains is higher than for other vaccine strains. Our study provides new data to support the national rabies control programme.",
