Here we show that human monocytes constitutively express p17Rs and that p17 selectively triggers these cells to produce MCP-1. The effect of p17 on MCP-1 expression was observed at the transcriptional level and was primarily dependent on the activation of the transcription factor AP-1. p17 increased the binding activity of AP-1 complexes in a time-and dosedependent manner. Deletion of the AP-1 binding sites in the MCP-1 promoter resulted in the lack of p17induced MCP-1 transcription. In particular, the P3 binding site located between -69 and -63 position seems to be essential to MCP-1 mRNA induction in p17-treated monocytes. An ever increasing amount of evidences shows a tight link between biologically dysregulated monocytes, AP-1 activation, MCP-1 release and HIV-1 pathogenesis. Overall our results suggest that p17 may play a critical role in the monocyte-mediated inflammatory processes, which are suspected to be major precipitating events in AIDS-defining diseases.",

            "text": "Blood monocytes are major in vivo cell targets of HIV-1 infection. They are known to be less susceptible to viral cytopathic effects and more resistant to HIV-1-induced apoptosis than CD4 + T lymphocytes (Herbein et al., 2002; Kedzierska et al., 2003) . Due to their ability to survive HIV-1 infection, and because of a chronic low-level viral infection, monocytes serve as a major virus reservoir (Ho et al., 1994) . Activation of monocytes by infectious and/or inflammatory stimuli increases plasma viral load (Donovan et al., 1996; Goletti et al., 1996) combined with increased numbers of HIV-1-positive cells. In addition, activated monocytes can traffic and invade tissues and organs, homing to sites of infection and inflammation (Fischer-Smith et al., 2001) . Productively infected monocytes may therefore ultimately serve as 'Trojan horses' for viral dissemination to different organs. Furthermore, a monocyte-dependent mechanism of viral amplification at local sites of initial infection appears to be a prerequisite for efficient dissemination of infection (Hirsch et al., 1998) . The analysis of infected monocytes reveals evidence of signalling cascades leading to upregulation of specific inflammation-related molecules, which include MCP-1 (Wahl et al., 2003) . MCP-1 plays an important role in sustaining both inflammation and HIV-1 replication (Fantuzzi et al., 2003) and is also involved in mass recruitment of such HIV-1 targets as dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages and T lymphocytes, into localized sites of infection (Cinque et al., 1998; Fantuzzi et al., 2000; Alfano and Poli, 2001) . The pro-HIV-1 role of MCP-1 has been confirmed by the recent finding that HIV-1 infection and disease progression are influenced by a mutant MCP-1 allele linked to increased monocyte infiltration of tissues and MCP-1 levels (Gonzalez et al., 2002) . Considerable attention should therefore be given to the mechanisms triggered by HIV-1 to induce enhanced MCP-1 production by monocytes.",

HIV-1 p17, as a recombinant protein, exerts a cytokine-like activity after binding to a specific cellular receptor (p17R) (De Francesco et al., 2002) . It is able to modulate the activation and proliferation status of T and NK cells (De Francesco et al., 1998; Vitale et al., 2003) and to enhance HIV-1 replication (De Francesco et al., 1998) . Moreover, it increases the release of such proinflammatory molecules as TNF-a and IFN-g, while counteracting the anti-inflammatory activity of IL-4 (De Francesco et al., 2002) . It is likely that, through the release of pro-inflammatory molecules, p17 may induce the activation of monocytes and modulate their functions.

As shown in Fig. 1A (left), cell staining with monoclonal antibody (mAb) to CD14 revealed that almost all monocytes constitutively expressed p17Rs on their surface. The presence of p17Rs on human monocytes was confirmed on cells purified by magnetic sorting using anti-CD14-coated paramagnetic beads as a specific reagent (Fig. 1A , right). The specificity of the binding was confirmed by displacement of p17/p17R interaction by the anti-p17 mAb MBS-3 (data not shown). The stability of the p17R + phenotype was then evaluated in purified monocyte preparations. Almost 100% of monocytes showed a p17R + phenotype after 72 h of culture, with a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) similar to or even higher than that observed on cells soon after their purification (Fig. 1A , right). At the same time, we observed a consistent increase in the MFI of p17Rs expressed on cells stimulated for 16 h with IFN-g or LPS. As shown in Fig. 1B (top) , IFN-g increased the expression of p17Rs on purified monocytes already at a dose as low as 0.2 ng ml -1 . A peak of p17R expression was reached at an IFN-g dose of 25 ng ml -1 . LPS was less efficient than IFN-g in upregulating p17Rs expression. A peak in p17R expression was observed at an LPS dose of 10 ng ml -1 . A kinetic analysis of p17R expression on 4, 8, 16, 24 and 48 h) showed that p17R expression was enhanced on monocytes within 8-24 h ( Fig. 1B, bottom) . The slow surface induction of p17Rs is therefore indicative of the de novo synthesis of p17Rs following monocyte activation.",

Results from EMSA experiments showed that treatment of THP-1 cells for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with p17 (1 mg ml -1 ) induced AP-1 activation, with a peak (5.2-fold increase) at 1 h after treatment, but did not induce any NF-kB activation (Fig. 5A) .

Further analyses were performed to characterize the specificity and protein composition of AP-1 complexes induced by p17 treatment in THP-1 cells. TransAM\u2122 analysis showed a preferential involvement of c-Fos and JunB in the active AP-1 complexes (Fig. 5B) . Altogether, our results confirm a similar AP-1 activation pattern by p17 in human primary monocytes and THP-1 cells, which suggests that this cell line may be used as a model in future studies of the biological activity of p17 in the monocyte compartment.

To investigate which regions are involved in the transcriptional activation of MCP-1 by p17, primary monocytes were transfected with different plasmids containing the reporter luciferase gene cloned downstream to the MCP-1 promoter. MCP-1 promoter luciferase reporter plasmids used included: pGLM-PRM containing the proximal promoter region of the MCP-1 gene, pGLM-ENH, which contains both the proximal promoter and the distal enhancer regions, pGLM-PRM-P2mut mutated into the P2 AP-1 binding site, and phMCP128, a plasmid containing a MCP-1 proximal promoter region whose AP-1 binding sites (P2 and P3) have been deleted (Fig. 6A) . Flow cytometric analysis of cells transfected with a control GFP-encoding plasmid (pmax-GFP) showed a high transfection efficiency of primary monocyte with over 40% of the viable cells expressing GFP as early as 8 h after pmax-GFP plasmid transfection (Fig. 6B) . Soon after transfection, cells were left untreated or treated with p17 (1 mg ml -1 ). PMA (20 ng ml -1 ) or TNF-a (10 ng ml -1 ) was used as controls of NF-kB and AP-1 activation. PMA and TNF-a resulted in a significant transcriptional activation (3.9-and 2.2-fold respectively) in cells transfected with the pGLM-ENH plasmid, in which both the MCP-1 promoter and enhancer regions are present (not shown). In p17-treated monocytes the luciferase activity of constructs pGLM-ENH and pGLM-PRM was induced approximately twofold (Fig. 6C) . The lack of difference between the promoter and the enhancer regions in response to p17, despite the potential AP-1 binding site in the enhancer region, indicates a critical role for AP-1 binding sites in the promoter region. Indeed, deletion of both AP-1 binding sites (phMCP128) resulted in complete loss of p17-induced activation. To further assess whether p17-induced MCP-1 expression was dependent on the P2 or P3 AP-1 binding site, we mutated the P2 region in the pGLM-PRM plasmid (pGLM-PRM-P2mut) and tested for p17 activation. Treatment with p17 resulted in luciferase expression in both cells transfected with the pGML-PRM or pGML-PRM-P2mut plasmids. This finding suggests that the P3 AP-1 binding site in the promoter region is necessary for optimal p17 stimulation.",

Schematic representation of the four human MCP-1 reporter constructs used to perform our experiments. pGL-ENH contains both the proximal promoter (between -107 and +60) and distal enhancer (between -2742 and -2513) regions of MCP-1. This construct has three AP-1 binding sites identified by open boxes: P1 is located in the enhancer region while P2 and P3 are placed in the promoter region. pGL-PRM contains the proximal promoter region only, whereas pGL-PRM-P2 Mut contains the proximal promoter region but has a mutated P2 AP-1 binding site. pHMCP-128 is a construct with deletion of both P2 and P3 AP-1 binding sites. B. The transfection efficiency of purified human monocytes was assessed by flow cytometry using a GFP-expressing plasmid as a tracer. In the left panel, GFP + monocytes are displayed in bold in the histogram, as opposed to untransfected cells (thin line). The percentage of GFP + cells is also reported. Transfection by nucleofection did not impair p17R expression on the surface of monocytes (right). Cells transfected with the pmax-GFP plasmid were stained with biotin-conjugated p17 and APC-conjugated streptavidin to detect p17R expression, and with PI to mark dead cells. Viable monocytes (PI -) were gated on FSC/PI dot plot (not shown) and an analysis was performed of GFP versus p17R dot plot. Quadrant statistics are shown. C. Purified human monocytes were transiently co-transfected with the pRL-TK control vector together with one of the plasmids described in (A). Soon after transfection, cells were treated or not with p17 (1 mg ml -1 ). Renilla and Firefly luciferase activities were determined 6 h after p17 treatment. Relative activity is expressed as fold stimulation as described in Experimental procedures and represent the mean \u03ee SD of quadruplicate samples from three independent experiments. AIDS pathogenesis. An increasing amount of evidence shows a tight link between activated monocytes recruitment, MCP-1 release and HIV-1 pathogenesis, especially in AIDS patients suffering from HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD). The selective accumulation of MCP-1 in the cerebrospinal fluid of AIDS patients with HAD, together with the finding that MCP-1 levels correlate with the degree of dementia (Cinque et al., 1998; Conant et al., 1998; Kelder et al., 1998) , substantiates a possible role of MCP-1 in neuropathogenesis. It is worth noting that the presence of activated monocytes in the brain is a better correlate of HAD than the extent of viral infection (Glass et al., 1995) . A chronic inflammatory state of circulating monocytes emerges over time also in HIV-1 patients receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). In particular, these elements evolve to a chronic inflammatory state characterized by an increase in chemotactic macrophage markers and a more mature (monocyte/ macrophage hybrid) profile (Pulliam et al., 1997; . Considerable interest is focused therefore on the mechanism by which HIV-1 makes active to induce dysregulation of monocyte activity. Understanding this mechanism will contribute to further identify the linkage between HIV-1 infection and monocyte activation and, ultimately, to achieve improved control over the replication and spread of the virus, and of the prevention and treatment of immune disorders.",

            "text": "Highly active anti-retroviral therapy usually leads to prolonged control of HIV-1 replication. Yet the blocking of HIV-1 replication is not linked to a complete recovery from immune dysfunction, thus suggesting that mechanisms other than active viral replication are involved in chronic immune perturbation. Structural HIV-1 proteins have been associated with immune activation and loss of functional competence by different immune cells (Quaranta et al., 2004) . Among these, the HIV-1 matrix protein p17 has been recently identified as a critical determinant in AIDS pathogenesis as it binds to a cellular receptor expressed on immune cells and enhances viral replication and infectivity (De Francesco et al., 1998) , through a combination of different effector functions (De Francesco et al., 2002; Vitale et al., 2003) . This structural viral protein accumulates and persists in the lymph nodes of patients under HAART (Popovic et al., 2005) . Moreover, amounts of the HIV-1 protein did not noticeably differ in lymph nodes specimens either before initiation of therapy or during treatment where the virus burden significantly decreased. This finding strongly suggests that p17 persists in patients under HAART for a long time in the absence of detectable virus replication making conceivable that their chronic activity on immune cells can lead to immune dysfunction. Furthermore, we have recently shown that p17 is released by infected cells (Fiorentini et al., 2006) and can be detected in sera obtained from HIV-1-infected patients using a newly developed p17 capture immunoassay (S. Fiorentini et al., in preparation) . The pro-inflammatory role for p17 is suggested by its ability to induce TNF-a and IFN-g expression on T cells and to counteract the antiinflammatory activity of IL-4 (De Francesco et al., 2002) . In the present study we have described the ability of the HIV-1 matrix protein p17 to perturb the biological activity of primary monocytes, by selectively inducing increased MCP-1 production and release. This process is mediated by the expression of p17Rs on the monocyte surface.",

Interestingly, p17R expression -in terms of mean fluorescence intensity -was strongly up-modulated on the surface of these cells upon activation of monocytes with IFN-g or LPS. The finding that p17R expression is increased by two known monocyte stimulatory molecules warrants the definition of this molecule as a new marker attesting for the monocyte activation status.

            "text": "Several signalling pathways have been hypothesized for the transcriptional regulation of MCP-1. In the human MCP-1 gene, TRE and kB enhancer elements exist in the 5\u2032-flanking region of MCP-1 gene, thus suggesting a role for AP-1 and NF-kB (Shyy et al., 1993) . We therefore decided to use the primary human monocyte model to assess p17 signal transduction pathways involved in MCP-1 gene expression. EMSA revealed that p17 does not cause significant changes to the DNA-binding activity of NF-kB, whereas it increases AP-1 binding in a timeand dose-dependent manner. Induction of AP-1 in both primary human monocytes and THP-1 cells was associated with increased levels of c-Fos and JunB proteins in the active AP-1 complexes. These results indicate that the p17-induced AP-1 complexes responsible for the MCP-1 transcriptional activity are likely to be c-Fos/JunB heterodimers. Deletion of AP-1 binding sites in the HIV-1 P17 induces MCP-1 by AP-1 activation 661 enhancer region of human MCP-1 (P1) or mutation of the P2 AP-1 binding site in the MCP-1 proximal promoter region had no effect on the transcriptional activity in response to p17. Instead, deletion of both AP-1 binding sites (P2 and P3) in the promoter region resulted in reduced p17-induced MCP-1 gene transcription levels, close to basal transcription values. Such evidence suggests that the upregulation of MCP-1 transcription in human monocytes by p17 may depend on AP-1 activation and binding to the P3 site in the MCP-1 proximal promoter region. However, a direct evidence for the involvement of the P3 AP-1 binding site in p17-triggered MCP-1 transcription is still lacking, as all our efforts to obtain a MCP-1 promoter-luciferase construct containing a mutated P3 AP-1 binding site were unsuccessful.",

            "text": "The finding suggesting that in primary human monocytes AP-1 could be a major regulator of MCP-1 transcription, independently of NF-kB activation, is in line with previous studies (Hanazawa et al., 1993; Wang et al., 1999; Lee et al., 2001; Cho et al., 2002) . Moreover, Cho et al. (2002) and Lim and Garzino-Demo (1999) have clearly shown that the P3 AP-1 binding site abolished inducible MCP-1 promoter activity in human endothelial cells and human astrocytoma cells (U-87) respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that, at least in certain cells, AP-1 activation can circumvent the NF-kB pathway by means of different signal transduction pathways leading to the induction of the MCP-1 gene. Interestingly, our experiments show a peak of AP-1 activation at 1 h after p17 stimulation and persists, at lower levels, up to 4 h. At the same time, MCP-1 transcripts increase at 4 h after p17 treatment reaching a plateau at 6 h of stimulation. The kinetics of AP-1 activation does not apparently well correlate with induction of MCP-1 gene. This finding may reflect the capability of p17 to trigger an unusual pathway that induce AP-1 binding to the MCP-1 promoter leading to the production of MCP-1 transcripts but also to their stabilization, ultimately allowing their accumulation. Indeed, it is well known that regulation of MCP-1 transcription is due to both gene transcription activation and mRNA post-transcriptional stabilization. Different studies have demonstrated that, upon different exogenous stimuli, MCP-1 mRNA half-life increases to 3 h while anti-inflammatory molecules may reduce it to 15 min (Poon et al., 1999; Dhawan et al., 2007) . On the other hand, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that p17 may activate other transcription factors that cooperate with AP-1 to determine the prolonged activation of MCP-1 transcription.",

In some cases, the viral protein responsible for AP-1 activation has been identified, e.g. the hepatitis B virus X protein (Tanaka et al., 2006) , the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (He et al., 2003) , the papilloma virus E2 protein (Behren et al., 2005) , the Epstein-Barr virus latent protein 1 and the parvovirus non-structural protein (NS) 1 (Kieser et al., 1997) . The common exploitation of the AP-1 pathway points to the wider role of this signalling event and of its downstream gene targets in viral infections. In the case of HIV-1, AP-1 activation is a redundant phenomenon, being performed by such viral proteins as tat (Kumar et al., 1998) , nef (Biggs et al., 1999) , gp120 (Gibellini et al., 1999) , vpr (Varin et al., 2005) and, as shown here, by the matrix protein p17. In the case of HIV-1, AP-1 activation may not only enhance viral replication via trans-activation of the HIV-1-LTR (Rabbi et al., 1997) but, as demonstrated above for p17, it may also modulate the expression of cellular genes. These effects could not only promote HIV-1 infection but also lead to functional defects and pathogenetic events, as demonstrated for MCP-1 and its contribution to the pathogenesis of AIDS dementia. Our results suggest that it is necessary to block the biological activity of the HIV-1 proteins (including p17) continuously released by infected cells despite the successful blocking of viral replication obtained by HAART. At the same time, the knowledge that p17 induces monocytes to produce MCP-1 by activating the transcriptional factor AP-1 should be followed up by new anti-HIV-1 therapeutic strategies capable of neutralizing the functions of molecules induced by the HIV-1 proteins which are known contributors to virulence and pathogenesis.",

Cells were then plated into a 24-well plate (10 6 cells per well) and exposed or not to p17 (1 mg ml -1 ) in complete medium. After 6 h, they were harvested and luciferase expression was quantified using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Test values were corrected for the luciferase activity value of the internal control plasmid pRL-TK. The results for the p17 exposed cells are expressed as fold induction of luciferase activity by the same construct under control conditions, taking the control (no p17 added) value as 1.",

Nuclear protein extracts from THP-1 cells collected at different times after p17 treatment (1 mg ml -1 ) were analysed for binding activity to oligonucleotides specific for different transcription factors. A. Representative autoradiograms of EMSA using nuclear extracts (10 mg per sample) from THP-1 cells at the specified times after p17 treatment and radiolabelled oligonucleotides specific for NF-kB, AP-1 or Oct-1. C: untreated cells; LPS: LPS-treated cells (1 mg ml -1 LPS for 0.5 h), used as positive control for NF-kB activation. Protein-DNA complex specificity was confirmed by competition with an excess of unlabelled oligonucleotide probe. The right panel represents a densitometric analysis of changes in DNA-binding activity of AP-1 relative to Oct-1, used as loading control. Data are expressed as fold of induction over control untreated cells. B. AP-1 family profiling for DNA binding activation from an ELISA-based kit using nuclear extracts (4 mg per sample) from THP-1 cells cultured for 1 h in the presence or absence of p17and AP-1-specific oligonucleotides immobilized to a 96-well plate. Levels of Fos or Jun family members in the active AP-1 complex of p17-treated or -untreated monocytes are expressed as percentage of relative activity where 100% is referred to 0 h values. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA test. *P < 0.05, statistically different compared with 0 h values. Bars represent the mean \u03ee SD of three separate experiments in triplicate.
