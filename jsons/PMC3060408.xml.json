            "text": "We conducted a community-based study of the effectiveness of face masks and hand hygiene to prevent influenza transmission in households during 2008 [3]. As part of that study, index cases in patients of all ages who presented with \u2a7e2 of a range of signs and symptoms consistent with influenza virus infection were recruited from outpatient clinics and private hospital emergency rooms from January through September 2008. A positive result for influenza virus infection on a rapid antigen test was used to determine eligibility of the index cases' households for additional follow-up. Index cases and household contacts were eligible regardless of preexisting conditions or treatment prescribed, but index cases who had household members with concurrent influenza-like illness were excluded [3, 4]. There was no recorded use of antiviral prophylaxis. Symptom diaries were provided to all household members at an initial home visit within 24\u201348 h of index case recruitment to record respiratory and systemic symptoms daily; 82% of initial home visits were conducted within 12 h of index case recruitment [3]. Compliance with symptom reporting was high; all symptom diaries were complete with the exception of 12 (0.6%) of 2170 entries. We provided each household with a digital tympanic thermometer and asked all household members to record their body temperature daily. Household members were followed up for \u223c7 days to observe secondary infections. Pooled nose and throat swab (NTS) specimens were collected from all household members regardless of illness at the initial home visit and at 2 followup visits 3 (\u00b11) and 6 (\u00b12) days later. Because index cases are likely to have higher viral loads, given their positive result on a rapid test [5], and are less likely to have mild illness given that they sought outpatient care, all analyses here focus only on the household contacts to avoid selection bias.",

We plotted average symptom scores by time since ARI onset, which was defined as the first day when the subject reported \u2a7e2 of the 7 symptoms. We plotted quantitative viral loads by time since ARI onset and calculated daily geometric means, imputing half the lower limit of detection (ie, 450 copies/ mL and 0.15 log10 TCID50) for the undetectable values. As a sensitivity analysis, we plotted viral shedding by time since onset of fever of \u2a7e37.8\u00b0C.

Characteristics of the excluded 76 contacts were similar to those of the 59 retained contacts (Table 1).

Forty-six (78%) of 59 subjects were persons aged 16 years or older. At ARI onset, the most common symptoms were cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, and sore throat (Table 2). Of the 34 subjects infected with influenza A viruses, 15 (44%) reported a temperature of \u2a7e37.8\u00b0C on at least 1 day over the course of illness, whereas 21 (62%) reported having a temperature of \u2a7e37.8\u00b0C on at least 1 day, taking antipyretic medication, or both.

            "text": "There are few data in the literature on the patterns in infectiousness in influenza virus infections over time, and how infectiousness may be related to viral shedding or symptoms. We investigated 3 alternative simple models for infectiousness in influenza A virus infections and found that if infectiousness is proportional to viral RNA shedding (or log10 viral shedding or presence/absence of shedding), then the majority of infectiousness occurs within 1\u20132 days (or 3\u20134 days) after ARI onset (Figure 4). Given the more rapid decrease in replicating viral load compared with molecular viral shedding (Figure 1), we may have overestimated the duration of infectiousness. In previous work, we estimated the mean serial interval of influenza to be 3.6 days [9], given an incubation period of 1.5\u20132 days [13]. This implies that the average time between ARI onset and subsequent transmission to household contacts was \u223c2 days, which is consistent with infectiousness profiles in between a proportional relationship with log10 viral shedding and viral shedding. From a detailed model of influenza transmission in households in a French household study [14], Ferguson et al estimated that infectiousness was highest around the time of illness onset, and that the infectiousness profile correlated closely with viral shedding [15], whereas in our data viral shedding peaked within 1\u20132 days of symptom onset (Figure 1). Similarly, Pitzer et al [16] found that moderate increases in transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome 5\u201310 days after illness onset appeared more consistent with changes in log viral shedding rather than viral shedding over the same period [17]. Because the majority of viral shedding measured with RT-PCR or TCID50 occurred within 2\u20133 days of ARI onset, isolation of patients or other interventions must be applied very soon after ARI onset; otherwise, they could not have any substantial effectiveness in reducing onwards transmission.",

Daily replicating viral shedding measured with TCID50 for influenza A virus infections decreased faster than viral shedding measured with RT-PCR. Patterns in viral shedding associated with influenza B virus infections were more variable and followed a pattern similar to that of data observed in volunteer challenge studies, with shedding at substantial levels from ARI onset through to 5 days after ARI onset [2]. We found that levels of replicating virus measured by TCID50 had high correlation with molecular viral loads measured with RTPCR soon after ARI onset but diverged as the infection progressed when TCID50 decreased more rapidly (Figures 2 and 3). A previous study also found that viral culture is less sensitive than RT-PCR later in the course of illness [18], perhaps because inactivated virus or viral DNA persist in the respiratory tract towards the end of illness.",

It is possible that we failed to detect infections associated with lower levels of viral shedding or shedding for a shorter period, because swab samples were collected on average only at 3-day intervals, and proportionally more such infections may be asymptomatic [2, 21]. Some individuals may have been infected without shedding virus. It is still unknown whether or to what degree asymptomatic individuals could transmit infection to others [22], although mathematical models typically assume that 33%\u201350% of infections are asymptomatic or subclinical, and these individuals are approximately half as infectious as symptomatic persons [23, 24].

It is important also to note the limitations of our study. First, because of sample-size limitations, our study was underpowered to explore in detail the differences by age and other characteristics. Second, because our study design tended to exclude households with >1 case at the recruitment stage, subjects in our study could be biased toward those having a lower risk of infection or illness [3]. Third, although we have investigated alternative models for the relationship between infectiousness and viral shedding, it is possible that specific symptoms also play an important role in infectiousness. Fourth, we have a relatively small sample size, and more data would be valuable to more precisely characterize patterns in viral shedding and illness, and particularly viral shedding associated with asymptomatic infections and before illness onset. Finally, we did not record symptoms in household contacts retrospectively, so we were unable to include in this analysis household contacts with evidence of influenza virus infection at the initial home visit; however, the general characteristics of excluded contacts were similar to those of contacts who were included (Table 1).",

This would allow more accurate estimates of the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic or subclinical, and the characteristics of viral shedding in asymptomatic infections. Future studies of naturally acquired infections with increased frequency of clinical specimens and a longer followup period would also contribute valuable knowledge about the shape of the peak and duration of viral shedding. If combined with data on transmission to contacts, these studies may be able to provide additional information on the relations between viral shedding, illness, and infectiousness, which would facilitate optimal application of interventions and control measures. Volunteer challenge studies can provide useful data, but large detailed studies of naturally acquired infections are essential to inform differences in time lines and trends by age and other characteristics.",
