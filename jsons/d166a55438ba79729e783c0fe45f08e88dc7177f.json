            "text": "In late 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, capital city of Hubei province in China. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection quickly grew by several thousand per day. Less than 100 days later, the World Health Organization declared that the rapidly spreading viral outbreak had become a global pandemic. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is typically associated with fever and respiratory symptoms. It often progresses to severe respiratory distress and multi-organ failure which carry a high mortality rate. Older patients or those with medical comorbidities are at greater risk for severe disease. Inflammation, pulmonary edema and an over-reactive immune response can lead to hypoxia, respiratory distress and lung damage. Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) possess potent and broad-ranging immunomodulatory activities. Multiple in vivo studies in animal models and ex vivo human lung models have demonstrated the MSC's impressive capacity to inhibit lung damage, reduce inflammation, dampen immune responses and aid with alveolar fluid clearance. Additionally, MSCs produce molecules that are antimicrobial and reduce pain. Upon administration by the intravenous route, the cells travel directly to the lungs where the majority are sequestered, a great benefit for the treatment of pulmonary disease. The in vivo safety of local and intravenous administration of MSCs has been demonstrated in multiple human clinical trials, including studies of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Recently, the application of MSCs in the context of ongoing COVID-19 disease and other viral respiratory illnesses has demonstrated reduced patient mortality and, in some cases, improved long-term pulmonary function. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASC), an abundant type of MSC, are proposed as a therapeutic option for the treatment of COVID-19 in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. Additionally, when proven to be safe and effective, ASC treatments may reduce the demand on critical hospital resources. The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in significant healthcare and socioeconomic burdens across the globe. There is a desperate need for safe and effective treatments. Cellular based therapies hold great promise for the treatment of COVID-19. This literature summary reviews the scientific rationale and need for clinical studies of adipose-derived stem cells and other types of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of patients who suffer with COVID-19.",

While numerous therapeutic and preventative avenues are being investigated, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) offer a compelling treatment option. In recent months, there has been increased interest in the clinical trial sector for the use of MSC therapies in COVID-19 patients. MSCs have received particular attention because of their ability to inhibit inflammation and cytokine storms as demonstrated in several in vitro and in vivo models [1, 2] . Early-stage studies of MSC treatment in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) models have reported improvements in the lung microenvironment, inhibition of the over-active immune system, promotion of tissue repair, protection of lung alveoli epithelial cells, prevention of pulmonary fibrosis and the preservation of longterm pulmonary function. MSCs also secrete molecules that are antibacterial [3] , anti-viral [4] and analgesic [5] .",

Similar to SARS in 2003, this infectious disease results in a high probability of ICU admission and mortality [6] [7] [8] . The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection includes the recognition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) by the virus spike protein and priming of the spike protein by the cellular transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) facilitating host cell entry and spread [9] [10] [11] . Severe respiratory illness is a primary outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection because the ACE2 receptor is widely expressed on alveolar type II cells and capillary endothelial cells. Also, the alveolar cells are known to express TMPRSS2 [12] . Viral lung infection results in the generation of a cytokine storm, as defined by the rapid efflux of a large number of cytokines. The elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines drive extensive lung tissue edema, air exchange dysfunction, acute respiratory distress, secondary infection and death in 0.7 to 17.3% of patients [13] .",

Moderate ARDS is defined by PF ratio of 100-200 and patients with severe ARDS have a PF ratio < 100. The mortality rate for mild, moderate and severe ARDS is 27%, 32% and 45%, respectively [20] .",

Management with mechanical ventilation and fluidrestriction provides organ support while minimizing iatrogenic harm [22] . Several pharmacological approaches have been tried including glucocorticoids, surfactants, inhaled nitric oxide, antioxidants and protease inhibitors. Unfortunately, these treatments have been found to be completely ineffective [26, 27] . Currently, no direct therapies for ARDS exist.",

These plastic-adherent bone marrow stromal cells were denoted as CFU-F due to their fibroblastic appearance and ability to form colonies in vitro. In 1991, Caplan termed these cells mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) due to their mesenchyme origin during embryonic development noting an ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes [29] . In response to the varying nomenclature used to characterize MSCs, in 2005 the International Society of Cellular Therapy (ISCT) proposed that these stromal cells be referred to as multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells and the term be reserved for cells that meet the following criteria [30, 31] In 2017, Caplan suggested that the name \"mesenchymal stem cells\" be changed to \"medicinal signaling cells\" to more accurately reflect the fact that, in vivo, these cells secrete bioactive factors that are immunomodulatory and trophic, meaning that these cells make medicinal drugs in situ [32] .

The ASC's immunomodulation of dendritic cell differentiation has been shown to be more effective than BM-MSCs [63] .

EVs comprise exosomes, microvesicles (MVs) and apoptotic bodies. MVs form directly by budding from the cell membrane and are 100 nm to 1000 nm in size. They are abundant in selectins, integrins, CD-40, phosphatidylserine and metalloproteinases. Apoptotic bodies are fragments of dying cells which form and are released in the extracellular space by plasma membrane budding during the apoptotic process. They are irregular in shape and are between 50 and 4000 nm in size. They are rich in DNA and histones [119] . Exosomes are vesicles of 20-100 nm size with endosomal origin. The exosomes exist intracellularly within multivesicular bodies which fuse with the cell membrane and then are released into the extracellular space. EVs carry membrane proteins, cytosolic proteins, transcription factors, DNA, mRNA, rRNA, miRNA and various signal transduction molecules. They are rich in heat shock proteins, annexins, cytoskeletal proteins, signal transduction proteins and multivesicular body synthesis proteins. EVs allow intercellular information exchange via different mechanisms such as internalization, ligand-receptor interaction, secreted factors and fusion-mediated transfer of surface receptors, to name a few. Thus, the presence of EVs by themselves in health and disease may be detrimental or beneficial depending on the cell of origin, the cargo they carry and the information they relay [74] .",

When cocultured with monocytes, ASC production of IL-10 was more pronounced and resulted in lower levels of IL-6 secretion which led to greater inhibition of immature dendritic cell generation [133] .

Although a tissue injection route, this study demonstrated safety in a veterinary clinical setting in a randomized blinded and placebo controlled fashion. Seventy-three dogs were [153] . There were no detectable significant differences in the incidence of adverse events between treated and placebo-controlled dogs. In a naturally occurring lung disease in horses, ASCs were used to treat lung epithelial and alveolar pathology [154] . Exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) occurs in the majority of Thoroughbred and Standardbred racehorses [155] [156] [157] [158] [159] [160] [161] , as well as other breeds that are required to perform strenuous exercise in their athletic disciplines (e.g. barrel racing Quarter Horses). It can lead to progressively decreased athletic performance [155] [156] [157] [158] [159] [160] [161] . EIPH causes persistent structural lung damage with fibrosis and vascular remodeling of the caudodorsal lung fields, as well as venous remodeling and occasional bronchiolar damage [156, 157, [159] [160] [161] [162] . This, in turn, leads to pulmonary hypertension, capillary stress failure and hemorrhage into the lung. There is substantial evidence of the ASC's ability to reduce inflammation, reduce fibrosis and repair damaged tissues [163] [164] [165] [166] . Therefore, ASCs were hypothesized to repair damaged vessels, prevent pulmonary capillary hemorrhage, reduce pulmonary hypertension and decrease perivascular inflammation and fibrosis in EIPH. All twelve horses treated with ASCs were able to race again without any prophylactic medications. Prior to treatment with ASCs, all 12 of the horses had obvious epistaxis after racing and veterinary confirmation of lung bleeding by tracheobronchoscopic (TBS) examination, despite having received pre-race prophylactic medications. Following treatment with ASCs, only 1 of 12 horses had epistaxis with exercise. Five of eight horses (62.5%) were confirmed Grade 0 EIPH (no bleeding) by post-race TBS examination. Two horses (25%) were confirmed Grade 1 EIPH, and one horse (12.5%) was confirmed Grade 2 EIPH on post-race TBS examination. Owner/Trainer performance evaluations following treatment with ASCs were reported on only six horses. Four were reported as significantly better, one as better, and one as unchanged. Again, all horses raced without prophylactic medications after treatment with ASCs and no treatment associated adverse events were report.",

Very few adverse events have been reported that could be related directly to MSC therapy. One case of pulmonary thromboembolism was reported 4 weeks after intramyocardial stromal vascular fraction injection in a patient with New York Heart Association class II heart failure [203] . Henry et al. performed intramyocardial ASC injections in 17 chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy patients with an average ejection fraction of 31% and two patients suffered possible TIA or stroke, but the cause could not be directly attributed to the procedure [204, 205] . These studies did not describe whether the cells were filtered before administration to ensure that the injected cells were single cell suspensions. Thromboembolic complication risk can be assumed to be higher when injecting clumped cells compared with single cell suspensions, particularly when performed in intramyocardial injections. In addition, the patients' underlying medical conditions must also be taken into account as they had a poor prognosis due to their severe cardiopulmonary disease.",

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of long-term morbidity and mortality occurring in up to 60% of patients who survive for more than 100 days after allo-HSCT treatment [214, 215] . Gao et al. [61] conducted a randomized, double blind controlled trial on the safety and efficacy of 230 UC-MSC infusions for GVHD prophylaxis after HLAhaploidentical stem cell transplantation in 62 patients with hematologic malignancies. Infusions of 30 \u00d7 10 6 UC-MSCs/100 ml/month) were well tolerated without acute infusion related toxicity or adverse events. The incidence of cGVHD in UC-MSC treated group was significantly lower than the placebo control group (27.4% vs. 48.4%). Survival and disease recurrence did not differ at 51 month follow-up, suggesting that UC-MSC treatment did not increase the incidence of disease recurrence. Interestingly, analysis of a subset of CD4+ CD25+ CD127\u2212 regulatory T cells (Treg) and CD27+ memory B-lymphocytes was higher in the UC-MSC treated group although the proportion of total T cells and B cells remained unchanged. Wang et al. [216] conducted a meta-analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials to evaluate the safety of MSC prophylaxis of cGVHD in 365 patients undergoing allo-HSCT. Beneficial prophylactic effects were seen with high dose UC-MSCs but not with low dose BM-MSCs. Prophylactic MSC infusion significantly decreased the incidence of cGVHD without increasing the risk of infection or primary disease relapse. Further, MSC infusion did not impair the antitumor and anti-virus T cell responses.",

No evidence of infusion-related clinical instability, adverse events or toxicity was observed at any of the doses tested.

            "text": "Matthay and colleagues reported the results from a prospective, double-blind multi-center, randomized trial (START study) to assess BM-MSC treatment in ARDS [229] . A single intravenous dose of 10 \u00d7 10 6 BM-MSCs/ kg bw was compared with placebo in 40 patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Angiopoietin 2 is a well-recognized mediator and biomarker of pulmonary and systemic vascular injury. Angiopoietin-2 concentrations have important predictive value for the development of ARDS [232] . In addition, they robustly predict poor clinical outcomes in adults and children with ARDS and are recognized as prognostic factors in patients with pneumonia [233] [234] [235] . There was a strong indirect correlation between cell viability and levels of angiopoietin-2, as well as between viability and improvement in oxygenation index. Angiopoietin 2 levels in plasma showed a significantly greater decrease in the BM-MSC group than in the placebo group [236, 237] . The reductions in angiopoietin-2 concentrations observed in this trial may be related to the release of anti-inflammatory mediators that can mitigate the lung injury. The patients in the BM-MSC treatment group had higher disease severity scores than Page 11 of 19 Rogers et al. J Transl Med (2020) 18:203 those in the placebo group at baseline, but mortality did not differ significantly between groups. No patient experienced any BM-MSC-related hemodynamic or respiratory adverse events. The authors concluded that a single dose of intravenous BM-MSCs was safe in patients with moderate to severe ARDS and larger trials were needed to assess efficacy. In a recent press release [238] , Athersys announced positive results of a randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 2a study which aimed to test the safety and possible efficacy of the adult BM-MSC investigational product MultiStem \u00ae in patients with ARDS. Within the prospectively defined group of patients with more severe ARDS, MultiStem \u00ae treatment was associated with a markedly greater rate of survival and progression to functional independence at 1 year. As measured at day-28, MultiStem \u00ae treatment was associated with a higher mean ventilator-free day (VFD) score of 12.9 vs. 9.2 in the placebo group, and a higher mean intensive care unit (ICU)free day score of 10.3 vs. 8.1 in the placebo group. As measured at day 28, among more severe ARDS patients, mean VFD in the MultiStem \u00ae subgroup was 14.6 vs. 8.0 in placebo subgroup. Mean ICU-free days were 11.4 vs. 5.9 for MultiStem \u00ae and placebo recipients, respectively. Quality of Life outcomes, assessed by the EQ-5D, were meaningfully better among all survivors who received MultiStem \u00ae treatment compared to those who received placebo. Lower inflammatory cytokine levels at day 7 in the MultiStem \u00ae group relative to the placebo group, including IFN-\u03b3, IL-6 and IL-1b among others, suggest the potential for MultiStem \u00ae treatment to abate the severe inflammatory response associated with ARDS. MultiStem \u00ae treatment was well tolerated in this very sick ARDS patient population, with no serious adverse events related to administration through 1 year of follow-up.",

During the spring of 2013, a novel avian-origin Influenza A (H7N9) virus emerged and spread among humans in China. The disease caused by this virus shares many similarities with COVID-19. Chen and colleagues conducted an open-label clinical trial in 61 patients infected with the H7N9 virus. All patients had moderate to severe ARDS. Seventeen patients consented to receive intravenous infusions of allogeneic menstrual blood MSCs after failure to improve with standard treatment and, in some cases, invasive ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Patients were infused with 1x10 6 MSCs/kg bw, three to four times. No adverse MSC infusion-related events were noted in any of the patients. The clinical outcomes were compared with 44 patients matched with similar symptoms, laboratory tests and other baseline characteristics. There was no significant difference in baseline data between the groups, except that the MSC treatment group had a higher incidence of severe circulatory disturbances prior to treatment. The MSC treated group demonstrated a significantly higher survival rate (82.4%) compared to the control group (45.5%). At discharge, significantly better laboratory test results (procalcitonin, creatinine, creatine kinase, prothrombin time and D-dimer) were noted in the MSC infusion group. At the 1 year followup, chest CT scans of the patients showed significant improvement in the MSC treatment group. At five-year follow-up, all tested survivors from the treatment group did not show any adverse effects of MSC treatment or decline in pulmonary function tests. These promising results support the belief that MSCs reduce the inflammatory effects associated with viral infection, induced cytokine storm and severe respiratory distress. Future placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials using a greater number of patients are desperately needed to validate these encouraging findings.",

On January 27, 2020 the patient presented with fatigue, fever and cough. The following day she developed chest tightness, hypoxia and hypertension and tested positive for 2019 novel coronavirus. Radiographs revealed ground glass opacity and 2 days later she was admitted to the hospital. She was initially treated with antiviral therapy (lopinavir/ritonavir), IFN-\u03b3 inhalation, oseltamivir, and IV injection of moxifloxacin, Xuebijing, methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin. Her breathing was maintained with a non-invasive mechanical ventilator. Days later she was diagnosed with critically ill type COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure and was transferred to the ICU for ventilator support. Eventually, the glucocorticoid and antiviral therapies were withdrawn, and 1 week later, 50 \u00d7 10 6 allogeneic UC-MSCs were administered intravenously. No obvious adverse effects were noted. The treatment was repeated 3 and 6 days following the initial treatment. Two days after the infusion of her third dose, she was transferred out of the ICU with normal vital signs and laboratory values and a negative throat swab test for COVID-19 antigen. Although this study was limited to just one critically ill patient, the positive outcome supports further investigation. Leng and colleagues reported similar improvements with intravenous administration of UC-MSCs into seven patients with COVID-19 noting improved functional outcomes and facilitation of recovery [9, 241] . The patients selected were positive for SARS-CoV-2, with one displaying critically severe type, four patients exhibited severe types, and two with milder symptoms of disease. An additional three patients with severe types were enrolled for placebo control. Prior to MSC infusion, all of the patients displayed high fever, shortness of breath, low oxygen saturation and pneumonia. When symptoms worsened, the patients received 1 x10 6 UC-MSCs/kg bw intravenously and were closely followed for 14 days. Virtually all symptoms subsided within 2-4 days subsequent to MSC infusions with no adverse effects. Chest CT imaging demonstrated that pneumonia infiltration significantly subsided. The majority of patients tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test at a week or two after MSC infusion. They found that MSC could significantly improve the functional outcomes of 7 patients without any observed adverse effects. Although no shortterm adverse effects were observed, long-term follow up after MSC administration will be necessary in future clinical studies.",

Such processes include an increased number of peripheral lymphocytes, the decline in the C-reactive protein, and decrease of over-activated cytokine-secreting immune cells (CXCR3+ CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+ CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells). Moreover, a group of CD14+ CD11c+ CD11bmid regulatory dendritic cell (DC) population increased after MSC treatment. In comparison to the placebo group, the MSC-infused patients demonstrated a decreased level of TNF-\u03b1, and concurrent elevation in the concentration of IL-10, suggesting an improved cytokine milieu. RNA-sequencing showed that infused MSCs were negative for ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which implied that MSCs were free from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis suggested that MSCs were involved in antiviral pathways.
