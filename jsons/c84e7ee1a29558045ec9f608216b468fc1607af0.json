            "text": "The initial demyelinating lesions in canine distemper virus (CDV) infection develop during a period of severe immunosuppression in the absence of inflammation. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that early demyelination is due to directly virus-induced oligodendroglial changes. In the present spatiotemporal study in experimentally CDV-infected dogs we observed diffuse up-regulation of T cells throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and T cell invasion in early demyelinating lesions. Invasion of T cells in the CNS occurred despite severe immunosuppression and without any perivascular cuffing. However, the major fraction of invading T cells correlated with sites of viral replication and coincided with the demonstration of an early immune response against the nucleocapsid protein of CDV. Activation of microglial cells was thought to have elicited the migration of T cells to the CNS by secretion of chemokines: marked IL-8 activity was found in the CSF of dogs with acute lesions. In areas of early demyelination, large numbers of CD3 + cells accumulated in the tissue in the absence of any morphological sign of inflammation. Whether the T cells at lesion sites contribute to the development of acute demyelination remains uncertain at this stage. Antiviral cytotoxicity was not apparent since viral clearance in demyelinating lesions is only effective when B cells and concurring antiviral antibody production appeared in the subacute and chronic inflammatory stage of the disease. CD3 + cells appear to persist for several weeks after infection since they were also found in recovered dogs that did not develop demyelination. Accumulation of immune cells, including a significant proportion of resting T cells (CD45RA + ) in the CNS in the early stages of the disease may facilitate the later development of the intrathecal immune response and associated immunopathological complications.",

Initial non-inflammatory demyelination in distemper develops during a long period of severe virus-induced immunosuppression and is associated with viral spread and replication in the glial cells of the white matter [32, 34] . The mechanism which leads to demyelination in the immunosuppressive stage of distemper is not completely understood. We have recently found that restricted CDV infection of oligodendrocytes with down-regulation of myelin gene transcription occurs in acute demyelinating lesions [37] , which had been previously observed in vitro [38] . Since viral infection of oligodendrocytes was only seen in a limited number of cells, this observation could not completely explain total loss of myelin in the lesions.",

That the CNS immune system could be somehow involved in acute distemper has been suggested by the work of Alldinger et al. [1] describing up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression in the white matter. Because of this unexpected finding we designed a spatiotemporal study to investigate the presence of lymphocytes in the CNS of dogs during the course of the infection against the background of an antiviral immune response.",

Purified recombinant CDV N protein (2.0 \u00b5g/ml) diluted 1 : 10, 1 : 20, and 1 : 40 in 0.9 M NaCl was applied as 1-\u00b5l dots (in duplicate) on nitrocellulose (NC) stripes. The dried antigen was blocked for 30 min (0.02 M TRIS pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 1% milk powder) at room temperature (RT) on the shaker. Subsequently, the blocked antigen was incubated with a 1 : 500 dilution of test sera in washing buffer (0.9 M NaCl, 0.5% Tween, 0.02 M TRIS) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C on a shaker at 55 rpm. Afterwards, the NC stripes were thoroughly washed with washing buffer. The stripes were then incubated with a mouse mAb anti-canine IgM (CM7, IgG \u03ba recognizing the Fc5u heavy chain region; Custom Monoclonals, Sacramento, Calif.) for 30 min at RT on a shaker. After another washing step, polyclonal goat anti-mouse antibody diluted 1 : 40 in washing buffer was added for 30 min at RT on a shaker. Again the stripes were washed, followed by application of a monoclonal mouse PAP antibody complex (1 : 100). After a further washing step, the reaction product was visualized using DAB as chromogen (1 ml DAB, 0.05 M TBS pH 7.6, 5 \u00b5l 30% H 2 O 2 ). Experiment 3: Demonstration of IL-8-like activity in CSF IL-8-like activity in the CSF was measured in 14 dogs with spontaneous CDV infection, which were presented at the Animal Neurology Service, University of Berne. All dogs were euthanized and examined neuropathologically. Seven animals had subacute to chronic inflammatory demyelination and seven were in the acute stage of the CNS disease. As a control, CSF samples of eight healthy dogs were used. Evidence for the presence of IL-8-like activity was obtained based on receptor-specific desensitization of canine neutrophilic granulocytes in repeated stimulation [5, 9] . The desensitizing activity could be completely or at least partially blocked after pre-incubation of the CSF samples with a polyclonal antibody against canine recombinant IL-8 (crIL-8), known to neutralize the chemotactic activity of crIL-8 [9, 25] . crIL-8 (Repligen Corporation, Needham, Mass.) was used in a chemotaxis assay using a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, Md.) to prove that IL-8 elicits chemotactic activity for canine mononuclear cells (including about 85% lymphocytes and 15% monocytes).",

Two phenomena were observed: marked T cell invasion in early demyelinating lesions and diffuse up-regulation of T cells throughout the CNS. Passive diffusion of these cells from the blood is unlikely, because there is no evidence for blood-brain barrier breakdown in acute distemper [4, 7, 30, 35] . The observed increased numbers of T cells in the brain could not be explained by local proliferation of residential T cells, which can be found in small numbers in the CNS in normal dogs as in other species [18] . Rather, locally produced chemokines could be responsible for attracting T cells from the circulation. Indeed, we found marked IL-8-like activity in CSF in a group of dogs with acute distemper in the present study. It is known that besides neutrophils also T cells are attracted by IL-8 [17] . Potential sources of IL-8 are the microglia and probably activated astrocytes. Microglia are activated in distemper as shown by our present findings and those of Alldinger et al. [1] . Production of IL-8 has been shown in our study, but it seems probable that other chemokines also attract T cells, and numerous other cytokines may be involved in the immunopathogenesis of canine distemper.",

These T cells were not associated with blood vessels, which is consistent with the previously noted complete absence of any perivascular cuffing in acute distemper lesions. This suggests a high mobility of these T cells; they probably migrate quickly into the tissue without accumulating in the Virchow-Robin space. This is similar to Borna disease [23] in which CD8 + cells are trafficking through the parenchyma, whereas CD4 + cells are more restricted to perivascular cuffs. Our limited studies in frozen sections suggested that most of the T cells were CD8 + . This is also consistent with studies in frozen sections from W\u00fcnschmann et al.

            "text": "Although scattered T cells were also found outside of lesions and/or infected areas, major T cell invasion correlated with virus replication in the CNS especially in areas of myelin pathology. This correlation strongly suggest the antiviral nature of the invading T cells. This contrasts with the well-established fact that an antiviral immune response is virtually lacking in the immunosuppressed acute stage of the disease [3] . Antiviral immunity has been measured by its success to eliminate CDV by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and neutralizing antibodies, which correlates with an immune response against surface antigens of the virus [3] . However, while such an effective response is clearly lacking in animals that develop acute demyelination, there is some evidence for a weak antiviral antibody response against internal proteins in early infection stages [20] . Using a sensitive binding assay with recombinant N protein of virulent CDV in the present study, we were able to demonstrate a significant specific IgM response against the N protein of CDV starting between 1 and 2 weeks PI in the majority of animals in a group of experimentally in- fected dogs. We could also show in other studies that, similar to other Morbilliviruses [6] , a conserved epitope of CDV N protein is capable of inducing a CTL response in mice (Witteck and Zurbriggen, unpublished data). The early immune response to CDV N protein in dogs coincides temporally with the earliest detection of T cells in the CNS at the time when CDV starts to invade the brain. Taken together, these findings strongly support the notion that the T cells in acute demyelinating lesions are indeed directed against CDV, probably against internal viral proteins. T cell accumulation in acute distemper lesions did not at all appear to inhibit CDV spread: viral load continued to increase at least up to 31 days PI, despite continuously increasing numbers of T cells. Similar to corona virus infection in rats [14] , CDV clearance, the visible effect of an effective antiviral immune response, occurs much later in the inflammatory stage of the disease [8] , when the intrathecal antiviral humoral immunity develops with invasion of CD4 + cells, B cells [29, 36] and neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, there is no evidence that antiviral cytotoxicity contributes to demyelination in early lesions by killing infected cells, as for example could occur in Borna virus infection [23] . A humoral component [19] may also be required for autoimmune demyelination in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is induced by myelin antigen-sensitized T cells [26, 31] . Such cells have been found in experimental distemper [10] , but do not correlate with disease outcome.",

            "text": "In addition to T cell invasion in early demyelinating lesions, diffuse up-regulation of T cells was already found in the early stages of viral invasion of the CNS. These T cells were scattered in unaffected/uninfected tissue throughout the brain, mostly in the white matter and did not correlate with disease outcome: similar numbers of T cells were also found in four experimentally CDV-infected, recovered animals that did not develop demyelination. The later course of the infection has been described before in experimental distemper in a limited number of animals that are capable of mounting an early effective antiviral immune response [3, 16, 32] . Neither CDV protein nor CDV mRNA were detected in the CNS of our recovered animals. It is possible that T cells in the CNS, whose numbers in recovered animals decreased towards the end of the observation period, reflect transient presence of CDV in the CNS. The observed small glial nodules in the CNS of the recovered dogs would support this notion. An alternative explanation would be that homing abilities of lymphocytes are deranged as a result of the primary interaction of CDV with the immune system. In lymphatic tissue CDV mRNA and antigen were abundant already 5 days PI (data not shown). Although T lymphocytes infiltrating the lesion epicenter also occur in experimental spinal cord trauma [22] , we do not believe that T cells in our study were attracted to the brain as an unspecific response to injury. Diffuse T cell invasion in other canine infectious diseases such as rabies and central European tick-borne encephalitis is not as evident as in distemper, but may be difficult to assess because of a more widespread distribution of the lesions. Moreover, in conditions with neuronal or white matter degeneration such an up-regulation of T cells was not observed.",

The invasion of these cells may be directed by chemokine production associated with microglia activation, which in turn results from virus-induced tissue changes. Whether the observed T cells contribute to the development of acute demyelination remains uncertain at this stage. Accumulation of immune cells in the CNS in the early stages of the disease may, however, facilitate the later development of the local immune response and associated immunopathological complications.",
