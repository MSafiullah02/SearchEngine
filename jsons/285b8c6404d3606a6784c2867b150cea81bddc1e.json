Recent surveys and experiences show that Schi\u00f8tz and other researchers had correct facts and guidelines according to airborne infections. Secrets from the respiratory tract can go far off 9 m or more, for example, when coughing and sneezing, and pathogenic viruses and bacteria are detected in the air in rooms with infected patients [2, 14, 17, 18, 20, 21, 26, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . Airborne MRSA and other multiresistant bacteria may be a greater problem than previously thought [17, 18, 20, 42] . Even Clostridium difficile spores may become airborne under certain conditions [43] . Today, it is also known that most microbes are strong, surviving organisms outside the body [1, 44] . They can also survive on the outside of the protective equipment and even re-aerosol from these and even penetrate a wet mask [1, 4, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . Respirators (half masks) are more expensive (about 4 USD) than surgical mask (<0.1 USD). Because of a shortage during large outbreaks, it has been attempted to decontaminate respirators for reuse. However, this is not effective, is not recommended and cannot be done with disposable equipment [49] .",
