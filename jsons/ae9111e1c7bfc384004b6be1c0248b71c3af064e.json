Compared with standard linear panel data models, spatial panel data models take on spatial effects, such as the spatial dependence and spillover effects. Further, compared with the spatial model built on cross-sectional data, the spatial panel data model can grasp the individual heterogeneity of spatial units-that is, individual effects-and can escape missing variables and estimation errors more efficiently (Elhorst, 2014) Before estimating spatial panel data models, we need to test for cross-sectional dependence. The primary issue when confronted with spatially referenced data is to determine whether spatial dependence exists, that is, whether \"nearby\" cases are more correlated than distant ones. A flexible way of assessing whether dependence in the cross-section of a panel dataset is spatially related is the particularization of the Pesaran (2004) test for general cross-sectional dependence (Croissant & Millo, 2019; Tato\u011flu, 2013) . Table 2 shows the cross-sectional dependence test reports; we can reject that the null hypothesis errors are i.i.d. This is not surprising given our hit map visual ( Figure 2 ) appraisal of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Consequently, we require spatial panel models. The estimation results for the SLM and the six spatial panel data models are shown in Table 2 . The parameters of the spatial panel models are estimated using the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator derived by Lee and Yu (2010) and the p-value is calculated using the robust standard error. All of spatial panel data models include two-way effects: individual (cross) and temporal (time) effects. Temporal effects for each spatial panel model are shown in Table A.2. Firstly, we eliminated SEM (2), SDM (5) and SDEM (6) models since there was spatial effect no statistically significant at %5 level. Following, we had to choose from models such as SAR (1), SAC (3) and SLX (4). The estimated coefficient of the spatially lagged independent variables (LM r and LM d ) in the SLX (spatially-lagged X) model was statistically significant at the %5 level. That is, the rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases for provinces in China are spatially correlated. This further suggests that it is necessary to construct spatial panel data models rather than SLMs, which do not consider spatial effects, if our objective is to explore the influencing factors of the rate of confirmed cases and their spatial spillover effects.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 602, "end": 617, "text": "(Elhorst, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1097, "end": 1122, "text": "(Croissant & Millo, 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1123, "end": 1137, "text": "Tato\u011flu, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1612, "end": 1629, "text": "Lee and Yu (2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1140, "end": 1147, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1306, "end": 1314, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1489, "end": 1496, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1858, "end": 1868, "text": "Table A.2.", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Comparison of Spatial Panel Models Estimation"}, {"text": "The pseudo-R 2 (99.16), likelihood ratio-stat (LR-stat) (85972), and Lagrange multiplier (LM) test of common spatial terms stat (41.853) for the SLX are higher than SAR (1) and SAC (2) models.
