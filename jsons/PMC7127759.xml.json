            "text": "Gangliosides are a diverse series of sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids present on the plasma membrane of most vertebrate cells. They are particularly abundant in the central nervous system. Sialic acid residues on gangliosides are sometimes modified by O-acetylation at the 9-position. Some biological properties are found to be associated with the modification of sialic acids by O-acetylation. The expression of 9-O-acetylated gangliosides is apparently associated with neural cell differentiation and migration (Constantine Paton et al., 1986, Mendez-Otero and Cavalcante, 1996). Expression of O-acetylated sialic acids on cell surfaces can also cause significant effects on the action of bacterial sialidases (Corfield et al., 1986, Varki and Diaz, 1983). It also affects virus binding, cell adhesion and the immunogenicity of sialic acid residues of gangliosides (Varki, 1992). Expression of O-acetylated gangliosides on the cell surface can alter the binding of pathogenic viruses. In most cases, it confers protection to the host from the corresponding pathogen. Interestingly, Influenza C and Corona viruses bind specifically to 9-O-acetylated sialic acids; however, these are relatively benign pathogens compared to the Influenza A and B viruses, whose binding to sialic acids is abrogated by O-acetylation (Higa et al., 1985, Rogers et al., 1986). O-Acetylation of sialic acids on murine erythrocytes appears to inhibit binding of the malarial parasites (Reuter et al., 1991). These data are supportive that O-acetylation of sialic acids provides protection from pathogens.",

Expression of sialic-acid-specific 9-O-acetylesterase in the fertilized egg consistently arrested development at the two-cell stage, suggesting that O-acetylated sialic acids might be involved in segmentation of the embryo, and the late expression in specific organs caused developmental abnormalities (Varki et al., 1991).",

The molecular cloning of genes encoding for various factors that take part in the biosynthesis of acetylated gangliosides is necessary to understand the biological functions of O-acetylated gangliosides during development. Previously, we have reported the isolation of a novel cDNA encoding for a putative acetyl-CoA transporter that is required for the formation of O-acetylated gangliosides (Kanamori et al., 1997). Since expression of O-acetylated gangliosides is developmentally regulated, it is necessary to analyze the expression of acetyl-CoA transporter protein during embryonic development. As mouse is a model experimental system, the study of mouse genes is becoming increasingly important with the advent of gene-targeting technology. However, mouse acetyl-CoA transporter cDNA has not been isolated so far. In this paper we report, for the first time, cDNA cloning of putative mouse acetyl-CoA transporter, and study its expression during embryonic development.",

The mouse Acatn cDNA sequence was highly homologous with the human cDNA, and it exhibited 87% homology at nucleotide sequence level and 92% homology on the basis of amino acid sequence. Hydropathy analysis revealed a highly hydrophobic, transmembrane protein with approximately 6 to 10 transmembrane domains, similar to human Acatn protein (data not shown).

            "text": "Homology searches of mouse Acatn against currently available nucleotide and protein databases revealed two hypothetical proteins with high degree of homology: a putative transmembrane protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (EMBL, accession No. Z36088) that has 560 amino acids with 34% homology, and a protein from Caenorhabditis elegans T26C5.3 (EMBL, accession No. Z50859) that has 632 amino acids with 49% homology on the basis of amino-acid sequence. As shown in Fig. 2\n, there are highly conserved segments among acetyl-CoA transporter and its homologs from different organisms. In particular, maximum homology is seen in the regions corresponding to amino acid residues 72\u2013246 and 431\u2013482 of mouse Acatn, suggesting that these might be functionally more significant domains of Acatn protein. The function of these homologous proteins in C. elegans and S. cerevisiae is not yet known. Since these organisms lack both sialic acids and gangliosides, it is unlikely that Acatn is involved solely in acetylation of sialic acids. Thus Acatn (and its homologs) might be involved in other acetylation processes as well. In addition to these two proteins, mouse Acatn protein also exhibited low similarity to Amp G protein of Escherichia coli (EMBL, accession No. X82158) with 22% identity on the basis of amino acid sequence (data not shown), indicating an evolutionary relationship between these two proteins. Interestingly, like other homologs, there are several conserved amino-acid residues in the region corresponding to amino-acid position between 66 and 237 of mouse Acatn. The gene product of ampG is a 53 kDa hydrophobic protein with 7 to10 transmembrane domains, and is found to be involved in the transport of muropeptides of bacterial cell wall inside the cell and also in the regulation of beta-lactamase induction (Jacobs et al., 1994, Lindquist et al., 1993). At present, the role of AmpG protein in acetylation process is not known.",

            "text": "Mouse Acatn cDNA was introduced into HeLa/GT3+ recipient cells, that express precursor gangliosides GT3 but lack 9-O-acetylated GT3. A BamHI\u2013Xba I fragment of mouse Acatn cDNA (nt 1\u20131653) containing the entire coding sequence was subcloned into BamHI and XbaI sites of mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1. The resultant plasmid, designated as pcDNA3.1-Acatn, was transfected into HeLa/GT3+ cells. Expression of 9-O-acetylated gangliosides in HeLa/GT3+ cells was detected by immunostaining with mAb 493D4, specific for 9-O-acetylated GT3. As shown in Fig. 3\n, expression of 9-O-acetylated gangliosides was strongly detected with mAb 493D4 on Acatn transfected cells as compared with the cells transfected with vector pcDNA3.1 alone, indicating that Acatn protein does play an important role in acetylation of gangliosides. Our previous studies on the expression of human Acatn cDNA in COS-1/GD3+ and HeLa/GT3+ cells also showed a high level expression of 9-O-acetylated GT3 and GD3 in the transfected cells (Kanamori et al., 1997). Based on these results and also earlier studies on in vitro transport activity for acetyl-CoA (Kanamori et al., 1997), the protein encoded by Acatn is suggested to be an acetyl-CoA transporter that is involved in the process of O-acetylation.",

High level of expression was observed in early embryonic stage ED7, and then there was a subsequent decrease in the expression level up to embryonic day 17, as shown in Fig. 4C, suggesting a highly specific role for Acatn protein during early embryonic development. A major transcript of 3.0 kb was detected in all the embryonic stages. Expression of Acatn mRNA during developmental stages was also examined by in situ hybridization using rat embryos, because expression of acetylated gangliosides is very well characterized in rat system (Schlosshauer et al., 1988, Varki, 1992). In the 10 day old embryo, high level of mRNA expression was detected in the neural tube and neural crest cells using Acatn antisense RNA probe (data not shown). In the 13 day old embryo, maximum expression was detected in the dorsal root ganglia (derived from neural crest) with Acatn antisense RNA probe (Fig. 5A\n). In the 16 day old embryo, expression of Acatn mRNA was also detected in dorsal root ganglia, but the expression level was low as compared with that in the 13 day old embryo (Fig. 5C). With the control sense probe, no signal was detected in the rat embryos (Fig. 5B, D). In the 18 day old embryo, Acatn expression was barely detected in dorsal root ganglia (data not shown), suggesting that there is a decrease in Acatn expression levels at later stages of embryonic development, as also observed by Northern blot analysis. Earlier studies have indicated the developmentally regulated expression of 9-O-acetylated gangliosides in rat. In early embryonic stages, ED8\u201311, expression of 9-O-acetylated gangliosides was observed in neural tube and neural crest cells. In embryonic stages from ED13\u201318, expression of 9-O-acetylated gangliosides was detected in dorsal root ganglia and germinal cells in the ventricular zones (Varki, 1992). Hence, the expression of Acatn mRNA is in accordance with the expression of O-acetylated gangliosides during embryonic development.",

            "text": "We have isolated a mouse cDNA encoding for an acetyl-CoA transporter which exhibited 87% homology with the human cDNA at nucleotide sequence level. Acatn is found to be evolutionarily conserved as its homologs are detected in various organisms including C. elegans, S. cerevisiae and E. coli, exhibiting 49%, 34% and 22% homology, respectively, with mouse Acatn protein. In particular, maximum homology is seen in the regions corresponding to amino acid residues 72\u2013246 and 431\u2013482 of mouse Acatn protein. Transfection of Acatn cDNA into HeLa/GT3+ cells resulted in high expression of 9-O-acetylated gangliosides, indicating that it plays an important role in the acetylation of gangliosides. During embryonic development, Acatn expression levels were high during early embryonic stages such as ED7 and there was a subsequent decrease in expression levels in later stages, suggesting that Acatn expression is developmentally regulated. Expression of Acatn was also found to be tissue-specific, as it was detected in neural tube and neural crest cells in early embryonic stages of development and, in later stages, the expression was detected in dorsal root ganglia. In adult stages, transcript of Acatn was detected in all the tissues, with higher expression levels in kidney and liver. Although transcript of Acatn is more widely distributed in adult stages, until now, acetylated gangliosides have been reported only in adult kidney, brain and adrenal medulla (Leclerc et al., 1992, Reivinen et al., 1992, Schlosshauer et al., 1988), suggesting that some other factors also might be involved in regulation of the expression of acetylated gangliosides. In fact, another cDNA clone that is involved in O-acetylation of gangliosides had been isolated from rat brain (Ogura et al., 1996). The predicted sequence of the protein does not share any similarity with Acatn protein. The function of this protein as an O-acetyltransferase is not yet clear. Homologs of Acatn protein have been identified in C. elegans and S. cerevisiae. Since these organisms have neither gangliosides nor sialic acids, it is unlikely that Acatn is involved solely in acetylation of sialic acids. Thus Acatn protein might be involved in other acetylation processes in addition to the acetylation of sialic acids in gangliosides. Our earlier studies have suggested that Acatn protein functions as an acetyl-CoA transporter (Kanamori et al., 1997); development of transgenic mice with both the alleles of Acatn disrupted will be required to further elucidate the biological functions of Acatn during embryonic development.",
