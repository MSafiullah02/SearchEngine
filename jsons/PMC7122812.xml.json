Unless promptly isolated, hospitalized patients with active pulmonary TB can transmit to both healthcare workers (HCWs) and other patients [2]. HCWs could have an incidence rate of active TB 2- to 20-fold higher than that in general population [3]. The discovery of hospital-acquired extensively drug-resistant TB, with an extremely high mortality among HIV-positive patients, further highlights this deadly hazard [4, 5]. Rapid isolation of hospitalized patients with pulmonary TB is the pivotal step to prevent nosocomial transmission [6]. However, undiagnosed TB patients hospitalized for treatment of comorbidities constitute a challenge to TB control within hospitals.",

An expanded isolation policy which pre-emptively isolated all patients with possibility of TB achieved immediate isolation of >95% of patients with TB in low TB risk settings [8]. Nevertheless, the same policy would be impractical in a high TB risk setting because there would be too many patients to be pre-emptively isolated [9, 10]. For a laboratory diagnosis-based respiratory isolation policy, an important barrier is the limited sensitivity of conventional sputum smear [11, 12]. Compared with conventional microscopy, fluorescence microscopy has a superior sensitivity for detecting TB bacilli [13]. In 2011, World Health Organization (WHO) recommends switching conventional to fluorescence microscopy [14], under the condition that the switch should be carefully planned at country level with training, quality assurance, and monitoring on TB detection rate [14]. WHO also endorsed highly sensitive TB nucleic acid amplification test (TB-PCR) such as Xpert\u00ae MTB/RIF (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) [15]. Point-of-care Xpert\u00ae MTB/RIF reduces all-cause 12-month mortality in patients positive for TB symptoms at the time of HIV diagnosis [16]. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, the effect of introducing these more sensitive diagnostic tools on reducing risk of nosocomial TB transmission has not been documented.",

In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related chest radiograph screenings led to the discovery of a large nosocomial TB outbreak at a rehabilitation facility in Taipei, involving 65 cases of active TB in HCWs [18]. The index case of this outbreak was an elderly patient hospitalized for stroke rehabilitation without suspicion of TB [18]. Subsequent investigations found that the problem of delayed isolation of undiagnosed TB patients also existed in other hospitals [19, 20]. In response, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued guidance on nosocomial TB control [21]. To facilitate laboratory diagnosis-based isolation, Medical Center A started to roll out auramine-rhodamine staining with fluorescence microscopy since 2006 and completed the switch by early 2010s. We aimed to assess whether switching from conventional microscopy to a more sensitive rapid diagnostic tool improves early detection and prompt isolation of hospitalized patients with undiagnosed TB.",

Physician education and expansion of respiratory isolation facilities were simultaneously implemented along with the switching to fluorescence microscopy during the same intervention period. Nevertheless, we applied multivariable regression and causal mediation analyses to estimate the effect attributable to switching to fluorescence microscopy. Second, the study hospital closely followed the national guidance on nosocomial TB control policies issued by Taiwan CDC. Therefore, our findings might not be generalizable to hospitals with less proficiency. Third, the study hospital is a medical center, and therefore might not represent situations in smaller hospitals. Nevertheless, under NHI in Taiwan, people can and did directly seek health care in medical centers, without the need of referral from general practitioners. The 3 million annual outpatient visits and more than 90 thousand hospitalizations per year in the study hospital were predominantly from primary care services, rather than tertiary referral care. Finally, since Taiwan has a low HIV prevalence [35], only two of TB patients had HIV coinfection in our study. Thus, our conclusions might not be generalized to countries with a high HIV prevalence.",
