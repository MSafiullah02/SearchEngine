Due to the normal migration of population, China is facing high risk from imported cases. The potential specific medicine and vaccine is still in the process of clinical trials. Currently, controlling the impact of imported cases is the key to prevent new outbreak of COVID-19 in China. In this paper, we propose two impulsive systems to describe the impact of multilateral imported cases of COVID-19. Based on the published data, we simulate and discussed the epidemic trends under different control strategies. We compare four different scenarios and show the corresponding medical burden. The results help to design appropriate control strategy for imported cases in practice.",

The strong ability of transmission and high fatality ratio have attracted attention worldwide. WHO named the infectious disease as Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , it is the seventh member of coronavirus which can infect human [16, 19] . Compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 has a significant but volatile incubation period, a much stronger transmission ability and a relative low fatality ratio [6] . Another key factor of COVID-19 is asymptomatic transmission, it is reported [8] that the proportion of asymptomatic infected people could be up to 60% and it brings high risk for new outbreak. As of April 3, over 1 million confirmed cases were reported in more than 200 countries, areas or territories around the world [16] .",

Clinical studies showed that the disease is susceptible to all people, even worse, there is no specific medicine and vaccines. In order to ensure every patient to be treated, the Chinese government provide free medical care for domestic confirmed COVID-19 patients.

It shows that the imported cases would produce new outbreak of the epidemic if the domestic infected cases were not clear. After clearing that, the increasing trend due to the imported cases can be suppressed under strict immigration control strategy. The numerical results also show that limitation of international arrivals, the strategy carrying in China, is an effective way to reduce the amount of confirmed cases and also the medical resources needed.",

In Model (2.1), the home quarantine strategy keeps carrying on, we use parameter p and \u03bb to represent the quarantined rate and release rate. Compartment Q(t) in Model (2.1) contains not only the imported exposed population E i , but also the domestic quarantined individuals who are carrying no virus, so we use an impulsive procedure to describe the transition of E i to D(t) for Model (2.1) . \u03c9 denotes the proportion of becoming diagnosed from the imported exposed population E i in Model (2.1) during the isolation period. Model (2.2) describes the scenario after the resumption of work, all of the domestic population in China return back to their normal life, then the compartment Q i (t) includes the isolated imported population only. We use a continuous transition procedure and denote by parameter Q i the diagnostic rate of imported exposed population in the model. Both Q(t) and Q i (t) have no contact with the infected individuals, that is, the population in Q(t) and Q i (t) will not cause new infection. However, there are some exposed individuals in them due to the overseas imported cases, which we cannot detect them immediately after arrival. S i , E i , A i and I i are constants which denote the population of corresponding compartments from the imported population, the period is denoted as T .

After someone infected, the proportion of becoming symptomatic is denoted by \u03c1 and asymptomatic by 1 \u2212 \u03c1. Diagnostic rate of asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious are respectively denoted by A and I and the mean recovery period of class A, I, D are denoted by 1/\u03b3 A , 1/\u03b3 I and 1/\u03b3 D , respectively.

We apply the model in [9] to simulate the no imported scenario and the first 30 days of above four scenarios. We combine Model (2.1) for the next 90 days to finish the simulation for Scenario A. We use Model (2.1) for second 30 days and Model (2.2) for the following 60 days with condition E(t) + A(t) + I(t) = 0 to describe Scenario B. For Scenario C, we use the combination of 60 days for Model (2.1) and 30 days for Model (2.2) to simulate Scenario C with condition E(t) + A(t) + I(t) = 0. On Mar 26, CAAC announced that each domestic airline can keep only one route to each country and each route cannot operate more than one shift per week, each foreign airline can keep only one route to China and the weekly operation shift cannot exceed one [3] . This strategy caused a sharply drop of international flights from 1447 to 131 shifts per week. Scenario D describes the impact of this strategy with dropping 90% of impulsive imported population.

Especially in Shanghai, the peak value of D(t) is much higher than the previous outbreak. We also calculate the increment of AM R for C and D scenarios, see Table 2 .
