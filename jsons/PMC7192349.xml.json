This suggests that socioeconomic differences, local geography, differences in containment strategies, and heterogeneities essentially affect the value of the exponent \u03bc but not the qualitative behavior. A model of coupled differential equations, which includes quarantine and isolation effects, was used by the authors to match real data. Power-law growths for China were also obtained in another study and a possible relation to fractal kinetics and graph theory is discussed.9",

In all cases, we observe a power-law increase for the positive detected individuals, where the exponent \u03bc changes for different countries. In addition to the power-law behavior, we also computed the Distance Correlation (DC)10 between pairs of countries. The DC is able to detect nonlinear correlations between data.11,12 We show that power-law data are highly correlated between all analyzed countries. This strongly suggest that government strategies to flatten the power-law growth, valid for one country, can be successfully applied to other countries and continents. Furthermore, a model of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) is proposed and some strategies to flatten the power-law curves are discussed using the numerical simulations.",

Data were collected from the situation reports published daily by the World Health Organization (WHO).13 We notice that the values in the vertical axis in Fig. 1 change for different countries. Initial data regarding the incubation time were discarded since they do not contribute to the essential results discussed here. Black-continuous curves are the corresponding fitting curves \u03b1+\u03b2t\u03bc, where t is the time given in days and \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03bc are parameters. Insets in all plots show the data in the log\u2013log scale. Straight lines in the log\u2013log plot represent the power-law growth. The fact that the growth increases as a power-law is good news since it increases slower than the exponential one. However, that is not good enough.",

The exponent \u03bc changes for distinct countries and the complete fitting parameters are given in Table I. Results in Table I are presented in decreasing order of the exponent \u03bc; the USA [Fig. 1(a)] has by far the largest exponent and, therefore, became already the country with epidemic records. Even though Germany [Fig. 1(b)] reported a small number of deaths, it has the second large exponent, followed by Spain [Fig. 1(c)], France [Fig. 1(d)], and Italy [Fig. 1(e)], in this order. China [Fig. 1(f)], Brazil [Fig. 1(g)], Japan [Fig. 1(h)], and Republic of Korea [Fig. 1(i)], in this order, are the last in the list. In the case of China and Republic of Korea, the power-laws are more clear due to the number of available data. For these two countries, a flatten is observed after the power-law. The jump observed after 30 days in China data is due to a change in the counting procedure of infected cases (see the situation report on the February 17, 2020, in Ref. 13). Republic of Korea, on the other hand, focused on identifying infected patients immediately and isolating them to interrupt transmission.14 It is interesting to note that for Japan, another country that adopted similar measures, we obtained a similar value for \u03bc.",

Even though USA has the largest exponent and Japan the lowest one (considering the error in Table I), they are highly correlated.

The vertical axis is the cumulative number of positive infected individuals in the population. In the horizontal axis, we have the days since the first computed case in these countries. Black circles are the real data starting from the power-law-like behavior discussed in Sec. II. During the times for which real data are available, the model chooses the values of the parameters \u03b8 and \u03bas that better adjust the simulation results with the data. In the cases shown in Fig. 3, we needed three values of \u03b8 and \u03bas, namely, the values \u03b8eff and \u03baseff given in the figures. As a consequence, the red curves are in full agreement with the data in this time interval. When the available data end, the simulation continues and the red curves can be used to predict the asymptotic number of confirmed cases since they represent the scenario following the tendency demonstrated by the data. In the case of Italy, we obtain 5.6\u00d7106 and for France, 1.0\u00d7107. See the tendencies in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d). The considerable difference between these projections is explained by the last values of \u03b8eff and \u03baseff obtained for these countries. Besides \u03b8eff being larger for France, we obtain \u03baseff=0, which can be interpreted as the nonexistence of quarantine measures or the inefficient isolation of symptomatic individuals. We are aware that such asymptotic behavior can be hardly trusted with numerical simulation of models. However, our intention in displaying such asymptotic behavior is to show that the proposed model converges to reasonable values.",

For both countries, we assume \u03bas=1 for all strategies, which means that all symptomatic individuals per day are put into quarantine. We can see that the strategy represented by the orange curves is not sufficient to significantly reduce the total number of confirmed infected individuals for France, since the last value \u03b8eff=1.90 indicates a large level of social interaction in this country. On the other hand, for Italy, a considerable reduction is observed, specially for the orange-dashed curve, which indicates only the number of symptomatic cases. Strategies related to the blue curves mitigate the growth of the number of confirmed cases and, with exception of the dark blue case for Italy, lead to smaller asymptotic values when compared to the red and orange scenarios. The light blue curves, related to large social distance (\u03b8=0.8), are the most efficient scenarios to induce an accentuated reduction of the growth and a fast convergence to the maximal number of confirmed cases. Furthermore, green curves tend to approach the medium blue curves, which means that, for \u03b8=1.0, there is no significant difference between isolating 1% (\u03baa=0.01) of the asymptomatic individuals per day or doing nothing. However, increasing the daily ratio of detection and isolation of asymptomatic individuals to \u03baa=0.05, a noticeable reduction of the asymptotic value of infected individuals is observed (see magenta-dashed curves). Nevertheless, none of these strategies are better than increasing the social distance, scenario represented by the light blue curves.",

All blue curves (dark to light) tend to mitigate the growth of the asymptotic number of cases for both countries. However, values of \u03b8=2.0 and 1.5 still lead to large asymptotic values. The case with \u03b8=1.0 is the most relevant strategy to flatten the curve efficiently. From the strategies that combine social distance with quarantine for the asymptomatic and mild symptomatic cases, stands out the inefficiency of the scenario with \u03b8=2.0 and \u03baa=0.20 to flatten the green curve. On the other hand, strategies with larger social distance (magenta and orange curves) lead to more promising scenarios. The better prediction emerges when using \u03b8=1.0 and \u03baa=0.10 (orange curves). For comparison, if we consider only the symptomatic cases, we obtain the asymptotic values 3.0\u00d7104 (light blue curve) and 1.6\u00d7104 (orange-dashed curve) for Brazil and 8.7\u00d7105 (light blue curve) and 4.6\u00d7105 (orange-dashed curve) for USA.

Distinct power-law exponents for the countries are found and summarized in Table I. The power-law behavior suggests that the underlying propagation dynamics of the virus around these countries follows scale free networks, fractal kinetics, and small world features.5,6,9 While power-laws with distinct exponents may look visually similar, it is necessary to quantify this similarity. For this, we compute the Distance Correlation10\u201312 between all countries mentioned above (not shown). However, we use results for the DC from representative countries from four continents, namely, Brazil, Italy, Japan, and USA (see Fig. 2). They show that the power-law growth between these countries are highly correlated, even between North and South Hemispheres. The high correlation between the power-law curves of different continents strongly suggest that government strategies can be applied with success around the whole world.",

We apply numerically distinct strategies to flatten (or not) the power-law curves. Even though the social isolation, a well known benefit, is very powerful to flatten the curves, we found other strategies which lead to comparable results. For Italy and France, for example, the best scenario was obtained when reducing the social interaction to \u03b8=0.8 (light blue curves). However, if 5% of the asymptomatic and mild symptomatic individuals are identified and isolated everyday (\u03baa=0.05), asymptotic values of the same order of magnitude for the symptomatic cases were obtained even if \u03b8=1.0 (magenta-dashed curve). On the other hand, for Brazil and USA, our simulations confirm that to keep the social distance is essential to decrease the asymptotic number of infected individuals, and even better results could be obtained by increasing the tests to identify and isolate asymptomatic and mild symptomatic individuals (compare light blue and orange curves). The above combination between social interaction and the huge degree of isolation of infected individuals could be implemented to prevent economic catastrophes because people are not working. In other words, let some essential individuals go back to work (increasing \u03b8) and, simultaneously, increase by a huge amount the number of daily tests and isolation of infected individuals. This could furnish an efficient scenario to flatten the power-law.",
