[1] Studies within our group, and elsewhere, have demonstrated the application of heavier group-2 species to the catalytic hydroamination, [2] hydrophosphination, [3] hydrosilylation, [4] and polymerization [5] of substrates containing unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds. In addition, a number of group-2 mediated catalytic reactions have been reported that employ substrates containing carbon-heteroatom multiple bonds. These include the polymerization of lactides and lactones, [6] the trimerisation of phenyl isocyanate, [7] the dimerisation of aldehydes (Tischenko reaction) [8] and the hydrophosphination of 1,3-carbodiimides. [9] Guanidines have received considerable attention not only for use as ancillary ligands in f-block and transition-metal chemistry, [10] but also due to their appearance as functional groups in many natural products and synthetic pharmaceuticals. [11] Despite this, catalytic syntheses of these molecules remain limited to a handful of examples. These include the early transition metal, [12] lanthanide [13] and group 1 [14] mediated hydroamination of carbodiimides and group 4 imido catalyzed transamination of guanidines. [12a] As part of a preliminary study toward the catalytic hydroamination of heterocumulenes, we recently reported that \u03b2-diketiminato calcium amides, [{ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr}Ca{NR 2 }-(THF)] (Ar = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl, NR 2 = NHAr, NPh 2 , NHCH 2 CH 2 OMe), readily undergo insertion reactions with 1,3-dialkylcarbodiimides to yield the corresponding heteroleptic calcium guanidinate complexes. Furthermore, these latter complexes could be synthesized through a onepot procedure from addition of the amine and carbodiimide to [{ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr}Ca{N(SiMe 3 ) 2 }(THF)] (1) in hydrocarbon solutions.

Although it has proven to be a remarkably useful prototype for the elabora- tion of stoichiometric calcium reactivity, in the current context, use of the \u03b2-diketiminato complex 1 offers no advantage over the homoleptic calcium amide 2a in terms of either activity or ease of utility. Indeed it is likely that the \u03b2-diketiminate ligand is protonated and effectively removed during the early stages of catalytic turnover to provide common catalytic intermediates (viz. the homoleptic guanidinate complexes 3a and 3b, vide infra). Reactions were conducted using 2 mol-% catalyst and based upon initial substrate concentrations of 0.15 \uf76d. Although, in all cases, crystallization of the product from solution was observed at room temperature, the reaction yield of the isolated guanidine was consistently low (37-68 %). This latter limitation could be overcome, however, by changing the conditions for what is effectively a crystallization of the reaction product upon mixing starting materials and catalyst. In this manner, increasing the concentrations of the substrates to 0.3 \uf76d and changing the reaction solvent to hexane yielded the hydroamination product [{(2-FC 6 H 5 )N}C{NHiPr} 2 ] in 71-84 %. Again 1 and 2a-c proved catalytically active with most reactions taking less than 5 min at room temperature (Table 1 , Entries 1-4). A number of anilines and 1,3-carbodiimides were investigated under these reaction conditions and the results of this study are presented in Table 1 .

These observa-tions are consistent with those previously made in stoichiometric heavier group-2 chemistry. For example, although the calcium amide [{ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr}Ca-{NHAr}(THF)] reacts readily with 1,3-diisopropyl-and 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide at room temperature, this latter complex does not undergo an insertion reaction with 1,3-di-tert-butylcarbodiimide even after being heated to 60\u00b0C for 12 h.

A series of reactions were conducted at room temperature based upon a 60 mmol quantity of 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and aniline using 0.2-2 mol-% of 2a. These experiments demonstrated that whilst the reaction proceeds rapidly at catalyst loadings as small as 0.5 mol-% (82 %, 0.5 h), at even lower catalyst loadings product yields diminish quickly and the catalyst reaches a limit at 0.2 mol-% (56 %, 48 h).

Addition of 2 equiv. of aniline and 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide to 2a in [D 8 ]toluene yielded, in addition to 2-phenyl-1,3-diisopropylguanidine, a new calcium species, 3a, which could also be synthesized by addition of two equivalents of the free guanidine to the pre-catalyst 2a. Crystallization of 3a from a hexane/THF solvent mixture allowed the isolation of single crystals. An X-ray diffraction experiment revealed the product 3a to be a homoleptic calcium guanidinate complex with coordination at the metal provided by two unsymmetrically chelated \u03ba 2 -N,N-guanidinate ligands and two molecules of tetrahydrofuran ( Figure 2 and Table 2 ).

Variable temperature NMR studies upon a [D 8 ]toluene solution of 3a showed a number of reversible changes. At 298 K four independent isopropyl signals were observed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. In the high-temperature limit (353 K) these resonances coalesced to give only two isopropyl environments.

An X-ray crystallograpic study revealed 3b to consist, in the solid-state, of a centrosymmetric dimer in which five-coordinate calcium centers are bridged by unsymmetric Ca-N-Ca\u0408 interactions (Figure 3 and Table 2 ). The N-C-N chelate rings are disposed with and anti-configuration with respect to the dimer core giving rise to an S 2 -symmetric tricylic ladder structure. Further coordination at calcium is provided by terminal guanidinate ligands. As with 3a the guanidinate ligands in both terminal and bridging positions in 3b coordinate as unsymmetric \u03ba 2 -N,N-chelates. The calcium-nitrogen bond lengths of the non-bridging interactions [av. 2.379 \u00c5] are slightly shorter than those observed in 3a due to the higher coordination number at calcium in the former complex. The guanidinate bite angles within 3b [N(3)-Ca-N(1) 57.45\u00b0and N(6)-Ca-N(4) 55.08\u00b0] also differ slightly from those in the monomeric species with the terminal ligands demonstrating a more obtuse bite-angle than those in the bridging positions. Complex 3b demonstrated identical variable-temperature 1 H NMR spectroscopic data to 3a in [D 8 ]toluene solutions, indicating that 3a also undergoes dimerisation in solution with the exclusion of THF from the coordination sphere. Whilst alternative fluxional modes cannot be discounted, this behaviour may be explained by considering the equilibration of bridging and terminal ligands within a robust dimeric species with the guanidinate maintaining a preference for unsymmetrical coordination. Consistent with this hypothesis 13 C NMR spectroscopic data demonstrated two guanidinate ligand environments at 298 K, characterized by the quaternary carbon resonances of the N 3 C cores [ 13 C quat. = 151.5, 154.9 ppm]. Further qualitative evidence for the dimeric nature of 3 in solution was provided by the fact that \u2206G \u2021 was found to be independent of sample concentration. Although it has previously been reported that [{(Me 3 Si) 2 N}C(NCy) 2 ] 2 Ca(OEt 2 ) (4) is susceptible to reversible decomposition with reformation of a carbodiimide and calcium amide, [17] the attempted crossover reaction of [{(2-FC 6 H 5 )N}C{NHiPr} 2 ], 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 2 mol-% 2a yielded no new reaction products after 12 h at room temperature as monitored by 19 F NMR spectroscopy.
