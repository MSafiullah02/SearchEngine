Currently, the pathogenesis of the COVID-19 still remains unclear, and there is no precise and effective treatment. Recent clinical research suggests that some patients have mild symptoms and can recover quickly, while others may develop rapid disease progression, which often leads to respiratory failure and even death. Besides, advanced age at presentation has shown to be very useful in predicting the mortality in SARS [9] and MERS [10] cases. Elderly patients tend to develop a greater number of comorbidities, potentially leading to poor outcomes [11] . Besides, studies have shown that older macaques have stronger host innate responses to virus infection than younger adults, which promotes inflammation [12] . The current study confirmed that increased age was associated with disease progression in patients with COVID-19. CRP is an important inflammatory index and a significant predictor of disease progression. Previous studies on SARS have suggested the initial CRP level as a predictive factor of death [13] . Rapid elevation of inflammatory cytokines-IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha might have a role in the development of SARS-related ARDS. The timing of elevations in inflammatory cytokines and CRP is correlated with the progression of pulmonary infiltrates of SARS patients [14] . In addition, studies have found that CRP is one of the risk factors for disease progression in Wuhan patients with COVID-19 [15] . Moreover, lymphocyte count is another predictor of disease progression. The most common laboratory abnormalities observed across several studies were depressed total lymphocytes [16] . Recently, it has been found that the number of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 is significantly reduced, but the state is over-activated, which shows the increase of Th17 and the high cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells thus suggesting serious damage of immune system in these patients [16] . Our study confirmed that CRP and lymphocytopenia were independent risk factors for disease progression.",
