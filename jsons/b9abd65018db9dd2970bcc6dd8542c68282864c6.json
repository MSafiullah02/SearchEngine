Previous investigations indicated that spectral interferences exist in the analysis of CsA blood samples by the above methods. In TOF-SIMS, interference is caused by overlap of the Ag-cationized internal standard, cyclosporin D (CsD), with the Ag-cationized metabolite, AM1. To resolve this interference and obtain quantitative information, cross-correlation analysis was applied to the TOF-SIMS data. Application of damped non-linear least squares curve-fitting was carried out to resolve an interference in the MALDIJTOF-MS data due to multiple cationization products (i.e. Na and K). Measurement of standard samples indicates that the minimum accuracy (95% confidence level) of the TOF-SIMS method was better than 9% for CsA and 13% for AM1 using only one standard curve.' Similarly, the minimum accuracy of the MALDIROF-MS method was determined to be 14% for CsA and better than 25% for AM1. Blood samples obtained from transplant patients receiving CsA were analyzed by polyclonal fluorescence polarization immunoassay, highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and by both TOF-MS methods. Both TOF-MS results for CsA and mono-hydroxylated CsA are in good agreement with the HPLC results.",

The application of damped non-linear least squares curve-fitting (NLLSCF) was carried out to resolve mathematically this interference and subsequently allowed the quantification of CsA; however, the quantification of AM1 using NLLSCF was not thoroughly investigated in a systematic study. This paper presents the use of cross-correlation analysis (CCA) for TOF-SIMS data and NLLSCF for MALDI/TOF-MS data to enable the techniques to simultaneously quantify CsA and AM 1 in synthetic samples, and CsA and all mono-hydroxylated metabolites in allograft recipient samples. The results obtained from transplant samples are compared with gradient HPLC results which can measure CsA and some metabolites simultaneously.

Using this intensity ratio (1.907) the concentration of the 1 pg ml-' AM1 standard was determined to be 939 ng ml-' using the CsA standard curve.

The accuracy in determining AM 1 concentrations using CCA ranged from 0 to 6.0% (RE), with CVs ranging from 0 to 10%; these are also listed in Table 3 . The accuracy of this analytical method is slightly reduced when using CCA to quantify AM 1, compared to the direct quantification of CsA. This may be attributed to: (1) an inaccurate value of Ag-RIE; and (2) the calculation of the ratio (AM 1/CsD) using CCA. However, the accuracy and precision are still acceptable for clinical use.

This spectrum displays all six groups (Table 1) with reasonable intensity; the first peak in each group is identified with an arrow. The results of this curve fit are summarized in Table 4 . The mass separation (Am,) is defined as (mass group (2-6) -mass group 1). The error in the mass separation is highest for group 2 (5.16%). Also note that the FWHM is smaller than for the rest of the groups of known origin, indicating that the impurity is not being correctly modeled as (CsA + 2H + Na)'.",

Figure 6A shows a TOF-SIMS spectrum of a sample obtained from a transplant patient (no. 1) indicating a low CsA concentration and metabolite levels below detectable limits. The HPLC data also indicated small concentrations, ( < 50 ng ml-I ) of CsA metabolites in this sample, which is confirmed by the low CsA FPIA/HPLC concentration ratio of 1.3 (a ratio of 1.0 indicates no metabolites are present). Figure 7A shows a curve-fitted MALDI/TOF-MS mass spectrum of sample no. 1 ; this spectrum also indicates a low CsA level in the patient sample, with few metabolic products present. Refer to Table 1 for peak assignments. Thus, both TOF-MS methods are capable of detecting CsA and its metabolites. Figure 6B shows a TOF-SIMS spectrum of sample no. 2. Note that several Ag-cationized species are present with reasonable intensity compared to sample no. 1 (Fig. 6A) . These Ag-cationized species are attributed to CsA metabolites and are listed in Table 5 with their molecular masses and peak assignments. The HPLC data for sample no. 2 indicated extensive metabolism of CsA, which is also consistent with the high CsA FPIA /HPLC concentration ratio (3.2) . Inspection of the MALDI/TOF-MS spectrum of sample no. 2 in Fig. 7B clearly indicates the presence of several CsA metabolites.

Note that the FPIA results are higher than those from HPLC and both TOF-MS methods as a result of the immunoassay technique quantifying CsA and cross-reactive metabolites (see above). The CsA concentration by HPLC for blood sample no. 6 is higher than the FPIA and both TOF-MS results, indicating possible interferences in the HPLC assay.
