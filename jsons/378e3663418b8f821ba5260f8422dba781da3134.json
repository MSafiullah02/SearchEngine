Please note that, during the production process, errors may be discovered which could affect the content, and all legal disclaimers that apply to the journal pertain. The allocation of resources on mental health services is minimal (Upadhaya et al., 2017) with a vast treatment gap (Jha et al., 2019) . A unique concept to address this treatment gap in Nepal is the 'Satellite Clinic' whereby access to specialist services can be increased. In this modality, psychiatrists provide services to rural areas on an out-patient basis, monthly/bimonthly. A local community health center or a pharmacy hosts these outpatient services by charging a nominal consultation fee of three to five USDs.",

It is also the most accessible means at the time of the current pandemic (Kar et al., 2020) . In practicing telepsychiatry we connect the clients via the internet for direct interview and assessment (Shore, 2013) . In case of unavailability of the internet, a local health worker or a pharmacist could manage simple telephonic conversation or short message service (SMS). This can be an immediate and accessible way of providing health care remotely. However, telepsychiatry is not a part of routine patient care and standard consensus guideline for its implementation does not exist in Nepal. Hence, the use of telepsychiatry might be a daunting task for many.",
