Although still considered emerging infectious agents in some countries, these drug-resistant pathogens have become endemic in the United States, Europe, and Australia and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in these countries. These pathogens are commonly found in hospitals and clinics and are increasingly implicated in community-acquired illness.(3,\n12\u201319) They are typically spread by direct contact with other infected individuals or indirectly from fomites.(9,\n20\u201321)",

However, it is poorly stable in solution. When stabilized with carbonate and maintained at a high pH (>8.5), chlorine dioxide is present primarily as chlorite, a more stable form.(22) Although chlorite has nearly the same oxidative capacity as chlorine dioxide, the germicidal potential of chlorite is not well known. If stabilized chlorine dioxide is acidified, however, ClO2 gas will be regenerated. This is an important consideration for application, since chlorite is a respiratory irritant but has no established exposure limit, while ClO2 has an occupational exposure limit of 0.1 ppm. Stabilized chlorine dioxide products that have been activated are reported to be efficient bactericides, with previous studies showing as little as 0.75 mg/L of available chlorine dioxide capable of at least a log10 reduction = 4 for vegetative bacteria.(23\u201324)",

In this study, disinfection of MRSA and VRE was evaluated on a range of hard (glass, stainless steel, and floor tiles) and soft surfaces (carpet and cotton fabric). No significant difference was found in the level of disinfection observed between different surface types (p > 0.05). Surface type differences were potentially occluded by the variability between inter-trial results for particular surfaces. The log10 reduction factor for MRSA was generally greater than or equal to that of VRE, regardless of surface type. However, only the log10 reduction difference on carpet was significant (p = 0.004).",

However, in circumstances where contamination is significant or for instances in which direct patient contact risks are limited, disinfectant fogging may be an appropriate supplement to routine cleaning or disinfectant processes for non-critical surfaces. Furthermore, as community-acquired MRSA is a growing concern, the use of disinfectant fogs outside the health care setting may become more common.
