Los Angeles has been one of the first cities in the United States to declare the state of emergency on March 4 th , progressively issuing stronger policies involving-among the others-social distancing, the prohibition of crowded private and public gatherings and closure of leisure premises. These interventions highly disrupt and modify daily activities and habits, urban mobility and micro-level interactions between citizens. One of the many social phenomena that could be influenced by such measures is crime. Exploiting public data on crime in Los Angeles, and relying on routine activity and pattern theories of crime, this work investigates whether and how new coronavirus containment policies have an impact on crime trends in a metropolis using Bayesian structural time-series (BSTS) models. The article specifically focuses on nine urban crime categories, daily monitored from January 1 st 2017 to March 28 th 2020. The analyses have been updated bi-weekly (up to March 16 th and up to March 28 th 2020) to dynamically assess the short-term effects of mild and hard interventions to shed light on how crime adapts to such structural modification of the environment. The results show that overall crime in Las Angeles is significantly decreasing, as well as robbery, shoplifting, theft and battery. No significant effect has been found for stolen vehicle, burglary, assault with deadly weapon, intimate partner violence and homicide. In the last section of this article, policy implications are also discussed.",

Several newspapers have already started to report and describe micro-level short-term changing these major societal modifications to the lives of millions of people influence urban crime occurrence. Specifically, it is crucial to understand what types of crime, if any, are mostly influenced by the forced modification of daily habits and behaviors. This quasiexperimental context will help in explaining what are the main changes that are plausible to foresee in these situations and what may be the underlying factors that lead to trend variations. Social distancing and quarantine inherently modify micro-and meso-level human interactions within an urban setting, increasing or decreasing criminal opportunities based on newly adopted behaviors, as well as new criminal motivations. The modi operandi and the hotspots for crime are likely to change too. Theoretical implications of the results obtained are numerous due to the extent of transformations introduced by these policies and the novelty of the research proposed. Shedding light on these potential mechanisms can also help in theoretical advancing and in providing law enforcement agencies with indications regarding new threats and patterns in urban criminal activity.",

Section 1 highlights the gap of knowledge specifically addressed by this study and frames it within the criminological theoretical debate. Section 2 then justifies the use of the 2019-nCoV emergency to answer to our research question and outlines the adopted methodology and the data used for the analyses. Relying on two post-intervention time windows (the first one considering daily data points from March 4 th to March 16 th , the second one including all data points from March 4 th to March 28 th ), the present study allows to dynamically compare the effects of milder containment policies prompted during the first two weeks of March with stronger interventions put in place in the second half of the month. This design provides a unique informative framework to comprehensively assess the evolution of the effects as a result of policy tightening. 1 Section 3 presents then the statistical outcomes for the selected crime categories and the overall number of crimes in the city of Los Angeles. The models show, up to March 28 th , a significant decrease in shoplifting (-31%/-32%), thefts (-24%/-25%), robberies (-21%/-19%) and battery (-11%/-7.6%). Furthermore, the overall trend of crimes in the city of Los Angeles exhibit a reduction (-15%/-14%). Finally, section 1 Readers interested in accessing the previous version of the manuscript considering only data points up to March 16 th can freely read it downloading Version 2 from https://osf.io/gcpq8/. 4 reviews the most important results of the analyses, focusing on the future expected patterns and the most important policy implications entailed by the study.",

In 1918, the so-called \"Spanish Flu\" was a H1N1 influenza virus that infected about 27% of the world's population up for an almost three-year period, with death estimates ranging from 17 to 50 million globally (Taubenberger and Morens, 2006) . In 1957, a new influenza denominated \"Asian Flu\", led On March 11 th , the WHO declared 2019-nCoV a global pandemic as the virus spread widely across continents, leading to a dramatic increase in the number of positive cases and deaths. As the virus first originated in China and rapidly diffused across Asia and then Europe, the Americas, and Africa, countries experienced delayed contagion patterns and, consequently, started to react with policies and interventions at different periods (Wilder- Smith and Freedman, 2020) . At this point, most countries have already implemented (or are moving towards) policies that encompass social distancing as the most promising countermeasure to slow down the diffusion of the virus, as to protect their citizens and safeguard public health systems from collapse due to exponential or nearly-exponential increase of cases country-wise. As governments issue new directives, regulations, and recommendations to their citizens to proactively respond to the virus, cities, and communities, are progressively experiencing consistent changes in the way in which daily life occurs. Social distancing, as the most relevant strategy, clearly affects the way in which society behaves, impacting collective socialization, jobs, mobility, and the economy.",

Many studies, in this regard, have attempted to delineate and analyze the social and psychological effects of HIV/AIDS in different regions of the world (Keogh et al., 1994; Danziger, 1994; Barnett et al., 2000; Piot et al., 2001; McDowell and Serovich, 2007; Subramanian et al., 2009) .

Routine activity (Cohen and Felson, 1979) and crime pattern theories (Brantingham and Brantingham, 1984) outline how the characteristics and interactions of individual-level activities command the spatial and temporal distribution of offending and victimization. Assuming these perspectives, members of a community can be modeled as potential offenders, potential victims, and potential guardians, moving around and interacting in a socio-geographical space. Moving from these premises, routine activity theory postulates that offenders and victims (or targets) usually meet during daily, non-criminal activities (Brantingham and Brantingham, 1984) . Behavioral decisions then determine how the various agents react to each other's presence and actions. Crime occurs in the context of the everyday routines as the three factors converge in space and time: a motivated offender, a victim or potential target, and the absence of a capable guardian (Brantingham and Brantingham, 1984) .",

We hypothesize crime reduction will be strong in crime generators areas, which we intend as \"particular areas to which large numbers of people are attracted for reasons unrelated to any particular level of criminal motivation they might have or to any particular crime they might end up committing\" (Brantingham and Brantingham, 1995, p.7) . In Los Angeles, typical examples might include the Hollywood entertainment district, the financial district with its high concentration of offices, and the famous Staple Center. Also flows of people to some crime attractor areas are going to be reduced as people have to avoid concentrating in bars, nightclubs, or shopping malls, but also in high-intensity drug trafficking and prostitution areas.",

We hypothesize burglaries and shoplifting to reduce the most. There is an extensive agreement over the fact that burglars prefer to target unoccupied homes (Mustaine, 1997; Shover, 1991; Tseloni et al., 2002) . People forced at home will guard their houses for longer hours minimizing their exposure to burglaries. The reduction in the number of open shops and the limitations in the number of entrances-only a certain amount of people are allowed to be simultaneously in the shops depending on the premises' square meters-reduce the opportunities for crime by simultaneously increasing the guardianship and reducing the exposure of targets to potential offenders. Conversely, intimate partner assaults are likely to increase. Patriarchy and gender inequality are considered as the root causes of intimate partner violence; yet, situational determinants are also recognized to influence this form of crime (Wilkinson and Hamerschlag, 2005) . As a consequence of the spread of 2019-nCoV, couples-including dysfunctional ones-spend more time together with reduced supervision of possible informal guardians as relatives and acquaintances, two factors that may lead to an increase in violence (Hayes, 2018) .",

As requested by the method, these two covariates have not been affected by policies. This is trivial in the case of average temperature, while holidays may be affected in the future if restrictions will be prolonged for months. It is worth noting that this method generally recommends using more than two controls to evaluate the effect of an intervention on the response time series. However, in our research design, we assume that it is highly unlikely that any other daily predictor of crime in Los Angeles left out from this analysis has been influenced by the issued containment policies. The decision to exploit time series spanning more than three years has been made to reduce the potential biases arising from the exclusion of hidden trend dynamics, preserving the seasonality and long-term dependencies of crime as a complex social phenomenon.

The models run up to March 28 th show a statistically non-significant reduction of burglaries in the city with a higher posterior probability for both the univarate and the multivariate models (respectively, 80% and 91%) compared to the previous time-frame analyzed. It is likely that burglaries will be more affected by the stricter rules to fight the virus in the upcoming weeks and show a statistically significant reduction in the next future. Table 6 suggest that the policies adopted have not prompted any significant change in intimate partner assaults hitherto. The models considering the period from March 4 th to March 16 th as period of intervention show non-significant negative effects (-4.0% and -2.5%). The univeariate model considering the entire period identifies a small non-significant negative effect (-0.28%). Finally, the multivariate model indicates an increase in intimate assaults due to the policies (+3.3%); yet, such increase is not statistically significant. The explanation behind the absence of a clear and significant signal in the post-intervention period may be connected to the fact that dynamics of this crime are complex and the forced cohabitation of partners is not an immediate trigger of violence within the household. While in the case of shoplifting, for example, the closure of shops has a direct impact on the thefts within the shops themselves, in the case of intimate partner violence the increase might be delayed, once tensions intensify.",

Conversely, if the offender aims at using the car for a ride (or, in any case, for a short timeframe), the act is usually considered as the unlawful taking or driving of a vehicle. In the former case, the offense can be considered either a felony or a misdemeanor (depending on the circumstances), while in the latter the offense is generally classified as a misdemeanor. Table 11 : Causal Impact Analysis -Homicides 2019-nCoV containment policies do not show any statistically significant effect on homicides overall. In none of the two selected temporal windows, the model detects a sufficient statistically strong variation in the trend. Nonetheless, compared to first batch of data-up to March 16 th -, the last update seem to point in a two-fold direction. First, the relative effect has increased, going from -15% and -10% in the univariate and multivariate models respectively, to -28% and -24%. Second, the posterior tail-area probability p has decreased, thus increasing the posterior probability of a causal effect, which went from 67% and 63% in the first batch of results, to 86% and 80%. While still non-significant, these findings may suggest that the trends is moving towards a more stable reduction, and future analyses may confirm this hypothesis. While, so far, fluctuations hold a random nature, it cannot be completely excluded that future data streams may highlight a statistically significant effect instead, especially if the relative effect continues to increase.

The former set of crimes is directly influenced by the sensible reduction of social interactions and the sudden modification of daily habits (i.e., shoplifting, theft, and robbery). The latter categories, instead, may experience a stronger delay with smoother effects that cannot be captured in the short-term aftermath of a policy intervention (i.e., homicide, intimate partner violence, and assaults with deadly weapon). While situational crime prevention theories are extremely powerful in addressing the first class of criminal behaviors, they are less effective in capturing the dynamics of more complex crimes and should therefore need to be integrated with broader set of theories (Hayward, 2007) . In this regard, two potential concurring and complementary approaches that are potentially able to explain future emerging trends are the theory on crime precipitators (Wortley, 2001) , as complementary to the classic rational choice approach, and the strain theory of crime (Agnew, 1992) , which could be critical in delineating explanation of emerging trends as a consequence of the sudden amplified cohabitation of stressors resulting from Covid19 containment measures. can play a role in reporting abuses (Paquin, 1994 Besides crime evolution as a product of the reduction of opportunities and the evolution of social life, mental stress and fear of crime will also likely have a role in these dynamics.",

Alternative forms of criminal displacement, as tactical-or perpetratordisplacement (Guerette and Bowers, 2009 ) could also occur as a result of new opportunities arising in the aftermath of a situation of emergency and high uncertainty. Also with respect to these crimes, it has to be observed that short-, medium-, and long-term effects might be significantly different due to emerging needs by the population-e.g., the need for funds to save endangered businesses-and criminal adaptation capabilities-e.g., reorganization of drug dealing.",

Homeless, for instance, could experience an increase in the likelihood of becoming victims of crimes, as a consequence of lower guardianship and social control. Furthermore, as people are forced to spend more time at home, the probability of intimate partner violence could become extremely high. Research found that intimate partner violence is as prevalent in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) relationships as it is in heterosexual ones, although modalities of intimate partner violence may differ (Ford et al., 2013) . For this reason, and to safeguard all the citizens involved in this health crisis, a systematic analysis of crime should also serve to the purpose of empowering remote contact points, facilitating distance reporting to make it easier for victims of domestic violence and abuse to connect with the law enforcement agencies. Distance reporting, for instance, could include text messaging services to reduce the risk of being stopped or heard by the abusive member of the household.",

This forced the WHO to first declare the virus a global health emergency at the end of January-due to the several thousand cases reported in China-and then, after the diffusion to the large majority of the world, to announce the global pandemic on March 11 th . The United States registered the first confirmed case in the State of Washington on January 21 st . Soon thereafter, new cases were reported. One of the first States to be affected by the spread of the virus was California. As a result of the increasing number of cases, the county of Los Angeles-representing the second-most populated metropolitan area in the United States-declared the state of emergency. While the first issued policies to help the containment of the virus were soft recommendations on social distancing, institutional intervention started to become stronger on March 16 th , with the prohibition of all events comprising fifty or more attendees. On March 19 th , the California Department of Public Health further reinforced the containment strategy, ordering all individuals living in the State to stay at home (County of Los Angeles, 2020). As happened in many other countries, these measures strongly impact on the daily habits of every living in areas of the United States in which such directives and policies have been promulgated. Micro-level human dynamics, mobility patterns, urban concentration, and public life are among the main social dimensions that are being disrupted and significantly modified. Among these dimensions, crime stands as well. As self-isolation, quarantine, and avoidance of social contact result in a lower density of interactions and in the increase of time spent at home, several criminological theories suggest that this could lead to a change in spatio-temporal criminal trends. This work specifically tested the impact of the Los Angeles State of Emergency and subsequent measures on nine crime categories and the overall number of crimes reported in the city.

Furthermore, we may have witnessed, especially in relation to the period up to March 16 th , a mixed dynamic combining both the effect of the mild policies and the fear of contagion. Fear of contagion has likely played a role in reshaping people's individual and collective behavior, even before the second half of the month when stronger measures were adopted. This process, directly impacting on the density and frequency of social contacts, has potentially fostered the effect of the policy recommendations on crime. In addition, social distance restrictions may have also influenced the reporting rate of criminal offenses affecting somehow the results. People are avoiding to spend time outside their home and this might have reduced their willingness or ability to go to the police to report a crime. In the case of Los Angeles, however, problems related to a reduction of crime reporting are mitigated by the possibility to report a crime using an online form for specific crimes (e.g., theft or theft from vehicles) or calling a dedicated number. This might help to reach solid estimates reducing the possible bias of under-reporting. The dynamics related to the lack of -or impossibility to-reporting are especially going to influence crimes such as intimate partner assaults where the cohabitation of victim and offender may make it difficult for the victim to report the offense to the police. Nevertheless, since neighbors are likewise at home, they are also more capable to exert partial guardianship on the episodes of domestic violence that are happening in their surroundings and call the police. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that neighbors",

            "text": "). In addition, research have shown that informal actors (e.g., family, friends, and neighbors) are often approached by the victims of intimate partner violence because they are proximal and may be able to intervene before, during, and after the violent event(McCart et al., 2010;Wee et al., 2016). Our models -up to March 28 th -show a non-significant increase of this crime category in the multivariate case, so it is very important to keep monitoring intimate partner assaults as stronger (and significant) effects might emerge in the next future.",
