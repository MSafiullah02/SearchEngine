This is an area of intense research with the pathophysiology underlying these clinical conditions becoming progressively better understood. This improved understanding has resulted in new therapeutic strategies that are being assessed in multicenter clinical trials. The chapter will begin by describing the incidence and pathophysiologic signifi cance of anemia in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) providing a differential diagnosis of the many conditions that may present with anemia in this setting. The chapter will next consider disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) focusing on the pathophysiology of a condition that has been associated with much morbidity and mortality. The underlying conditions predisposing to DIC will be detailed as well as a number of treatment options that have been implemented in clinical trials. In addition to DIC, thrombocytopenia may be caused by a number of other clinical conditions important to the pediatric critical care provider. The clinical and prognostic signifi cance of thrombocytopenia will be addressed and a focused differential diagnosis will be provided. Thrombotic disorders are becoming increasingly recognized in children and are a particular concern for the pediatric intensivist. The epidemiology of thromboembolism in children will be reviewed focusing on the conditions most commonly associated with these thromboses. Finally, a chapter on hematologic issues in the critically ill child would not be complete without a discussion of sickle cell disease. Acute chest syndrome, one of the most frequent complications of sickle cell disease resulting in the need for intensive care services, will be discussed in detail.",

            "text": "Anemia, derived from the Greek meaning \"without blood\", is used to describe a reduction in the concentration of hemoglobin below the lower limit of normal for age. The lower limit of normal for age is usually defi ned as two standard deviations below the norm. Although other indicators may be used to defi ne anemia, the hemoglobin concentration is most commonly used because of its accuracy, reproducibility, and because it is most indicative of the pathophysiologic consequences of anemia. Normal hemoglobin values vary by age and gender, and to some degree, by race (Table 38 .1 ). Children ages 6 months to 12 years have more 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) in their red blood cells (RBCs), and thus, can tolerate From Dallman ( 1977 ) , Geaghan ( 2005 ) T hese data have been compiled from several sources. Emphasis is given to studies employing electronic counters and to the selection of populations that are likely to exclude individuals with iron defi ciency. The mean \u00b12 SD can be expected to include 95% of the observations in a normal population lower hemoglobin levels than adults because of the rightward shift of the oxygen disassociation curve. Anemia is a symptom and not a disease, but the primary cause is in the hematopoietic system more often in children than in adults. Children infrequently present in critical condition because of anemia. On the other hand, anemia may be quite common among critically ill patients. Among adults, data suggests that as many as 77% of patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit have some degree of anemia, and by day 3, almost 95% of patients are anemic. The prevalence of anemia in children admitted to an ICU is less well established, but appears less than that of adults. A prospective multicenter study was recently completed, and determined that most (74%) children admitted to the PICU were either anemic upon admission (33%) or developed anemia while in the PICU (41%). An interesting fi nding from this study was that 73% of the blood loss that occurred was related to blood draws. One-half of the children required packed red blood cells transfusions while in the PICU, with most of the fi rst transfusions occurring within 48 h of PICU admission. In that study, transfusion in the PICU was associated with worse outcome, and the authors concluded that it is imperative to minimize blood loss from blood draws and to set clear transfusion thresholds in the PICU.",

Manifestations of anemia are usually dependent on fi ve factors: (1) the reduction in oxygen carrying capacity, (2) the change in total blood volume, (3) the rate at which these two changes have occurred, (4) the capacity of the cardiopulmonary system to compensate, and (5) the underlying disorder that resulted in anemia. In light of this, the hemoglobin concentration alone is not the sole determinant of the severity of the anemia. The clinical fi ndings of anemia are primarily the result of compensatory mechanisms to prevent tissue hypoxia secondary to decreased oxygen carrying capacity. The hemoglobin concentration is one of the three primary factors infl uencing oxygen delivery to the tissues. Thus, a signifi cant decrease in hemoglobin without compensation results in less delivery of oxygen to the tissues, and potentially tissue hypoxia.",

            "text": "In an attempt to prevent this tissue hypoxia, several compensatory mechanisms are activated. First, the RBCs generate increased 2,3-DPG that results in a decreased affi nity of hemoglobin for oxygen. Given the high oxygen pressures in the alveoli, this has a minimal effect on the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin in the lungs. However, in the tissue beds of the body, increased 2,3-DPG results in more oxygen being released to the tissues (rightward shift of the oxygen disassociation curve). Second, additional capillary beds open within vital organs, thereby minimizing the distance from the oxygen supply to the cells. Since the blood volume in anemia is unchanged or decreased, this increased perfusion can only occur with decreased perfusion to other, less vital parts of the body and/or an increased cardiac output. Data suggests that in anemic states, vasoconstriction occurs primarily in the cutaneous tissue and in the kidneys. The kidneys usually maintain a very low arterio-venous oxygen difference, and thus, can tolerate a signifi cant decrease in perfusion without experiencing tissue hypoxia. The decreased skin perfusion results in the pallor commonly appreciated during anemia. Cardiac output and blood fl ow velocities are also increased to maintain tissue perfusion. This occurs in children primarily through an increased heart rate although the decreased blood viscosity and a decreased systemic vascular resistance from the opening of the capillary beds also contribute. Other signs of increased cardiac activity include the presence of murmurs, bruits, and venous hums. It has been suggested that the tinnitus commonly associated with anemia, may merely represent the internal detection of bruits. With severe, prolonged anemia, the increased cardiac output may result in hyperdynamic cardiac failure with fl uid retention. In such situations, RBC transfusions must be administered in small aliquots extremely slowly (over several hours) with close monitoring of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and fl uid status. Finally, to compensate for decreased oxygen carrying capacity, the body will both increase production of RBCs and decrease their destruction in the face of anemia.",

Anemia and neutropenia follow, and often, the symptoms are related to the degree of neutropenia. At or near the time of diagnosis, there is usually a moderate to severe macrocytic anemia, a low reticulocyte count, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis is confi rmed by bone marrow aspiration. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with an HLA-compatible Adapted from Hermiston and Mentzer ( 2002 ) , Oski et al. ( 1998 ) sibling is being used with much success, and thus, supportive transfusions should be used sparingly to prevent isoimmunization. Immunosuppressive therapy may be used for patients without an appropriate donor. In addition to the aplastic anemias associated with decreased production of several cell lines, decreased RBC production may be related to pure RBC aplasias. The congenital form, Diamond-Blackfan Syndrome , is a rare and potentially severe form of macrocytic anemia usually presenting early in the fi rst year of life. In addition to the markedly decreased hemoglobin, the reticulocyte count is extremely low while the white blood cell count is normal to mildly decreased with platelet counts that may be normal, increased or decreased. Serum bilirubin levels are normal while erythropoietin levels are elevated. Analysis of the bone marrow is most helpful as there is marked reduction, or absence of erythroid precursors, while the other cell lines are normal yielding a markedly increased myeloid to erythroid ratio. Forty percent of the patients have associated physical abnormalities (short stature, facial, cardiac, and renal abnormalities). Transfusions of packed RBCs are often required at presentation, and may be required long term. Approximately two-thirds of patients will respond to corticosteroids. Those children who do not respond to corticosteroids will likely not respond to other therapies and may require chronic transfusion therapy or be considered for HSCT. Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC) is a moderate to severe form of normocytic anemia usually occurring over 1 year of age in otherwise healthy children. It is believed to be secondary to a circulating immunoglobin that inhibits colony-forming uniterythroid (CFU-E) or burst-forming unit-erythroid and it resolves spontaneously without therapy.

The reticulocyte count is useful in distinguishing among these diagnoses since it is decreased in disorders of heme synthesis (iron defi ciency, sideroblastic anemia, lead poisoning) and increased in disorders of globin synthesis (hemoglobinopathies). Iron defi ciency is the most common cause of microcytic anemia. It is most commonly secondary to inadequate dietary intake, but may also result from chronic blood loss. It tends to occur with a bimodal distribution occurring most commonly in late infancy, and again, during adolescence (times of rapid body growth and potentially poor dietary intake).

There are three major classes of acquired hemolytic anemia based on the mechanism of RBC injury: immune-mediated, microangiopathic, or infectious. The immune-mediated hemolytic anemias occur as a result of antibodies directed against RBC antigens. They are classifi ed as autoimmune , alloimmune , or drug-induced based on the antigen that stimulates the destruction of the RBC. Autoimmune hemolysis is mediated by autoantibodies (typically IgG) that attach to RBC surface antigens. These antibody-coated RBCs are partially ingested by macrophages in the spleen with proteolytic enzymes on the macrophage surface digesting portions of the RBC membrane. This process results in the formation of a microspherocyte, an RBC with the lowest surface area to volume ratio, which is the hallmark of autoimmune hemolysis. These microspherocytes are trapped in the spleen because of their poor deformability. The direct antiglobulin test, or Coombs' test, demonstrates the presence of antibodies or complement on the surface of the RBC and is another hallmark of autoimmune hemolysis. The clinical presentation varies, although the anemia may be severe with hemoglobin values < 6 g/dL. Other non-specifi c laboratory fi ndings of hemolysis may also be appreciated. Although autoimmune hemolysis may occur with lymphoproliferative diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus, and immunodefi ciency disorders, the majority of cases are idiopathic. Corticosteroids are the primary treatment. Splenectomy and immunosuppressive therapy have been used in refractory cases.

For example, factor Xa, thrombin, fi brin, and the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex have all been found to elicit proinfl ammatory processes. More specifi cally, the binding of thrombin to specifi c cell receptors known as protease-activated receptors (PARs) appears to be the primary mechanism by which this proinfl ammatory response is induced. These PARs are located in the vasculature on endothelial cells, platelets, mononuclear cells, fi broblasts and smooth muscle cells. Four PARs are known in humans. Human PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4 can be activated by thrombin while PAR2 is activated by the tissue-factor-factor VIIa complex and factor Xa, but not by thrombin. The effect of these coagulation proteins on infl ammation is supported by the clinical fi nding that infusion of recombinant factor VIIa in healthy human subjects results in small, but signifi cant increases in the concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8; a response that is absent when volunteers are pretreated with an inhibitor of tissue factor-factor VIIa. In addition to the effect of these coagulation proteins, the three endogenous anticoagulant pathways can also infl uence infl ammation. For example, activated protein C has been found to inhibit TNF-alpha release from monocytes both in vitro and in vivo and to block leukocyte adhesion in vivo . It has also been demonstrated to inhibit endotoxin-induced production of IL-1B, IL-6, and IL-8 in cultured monocytes and macrophages. Furthermore, inhibition of the protein C pathway increases cytokine elaboration, endothelial cell injury and leukocyte extravasation in response to endotoxin; processes that are decreased by the infusion of activated protein C. Moreover, infusion of recombinant activated protein C accelerated the decrease of IL-6 levels in humans with severe sepsis. In addition, recent laboratory experiments demonstrate common pathways in which coagulation directly relates to innate immunity against pathogens and microorganisms, contributing to the infl ammation-coagulation interface. Briefl y, infectious processes are responsible for recruiting cells and proteins that facilitate both immunity and coagulation (i.e. neutrophil extracellular traps [NETs] ). Likewise, thrombomodulin, the protein that binds to thrombin with subsequent activation of protein C, is also involved in the negative regulatory effect of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), a cytokine storm elicitor, contributing to the direct inactivation of complement C3b, and the indirect inactivation of complement C5a and C3a.

In addition to sepsis, DIC is commonly found in severe trauma patients and is closely linked to the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and worse outcomes. A combination of factors may contribute to the triggering of DIC in severe trauma, but clearly, activation of the cytokine network in a manner similar to sepsis is an established factor. DIC is also common among patients with cancer. In children, laboratory evidence of DIC has been reported in 3% of untreated patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia and in nearly 14% of those with acute myelocytic leukemia. Children with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) appear to be at increased risk. DIC has also been reported among children with neuroblastoma and other solid tumors usually in the setting of extensive disease. The pathophysiology of DIC in cancer is less well established although expression of high levels of tissue factor and cancer procoagulant, hyperfi brinolysis in the setting of activated coagulation (APL), and the release of cytokines that infl uence the prothrombotic potential, adhesive properties and permeability of the vascular endothelium have all been suggested.

Fibrinogen levels have been suggested as a useful tool for the diagnosis of DIC. However, because fi brinogen is as an acute-phase reactant, levels can remain within the normal range for a long time despite active DIC, making it a less sensitive test. Serial monitoring of fi brinogen levels, as well as these other tests, is more useful than a single result in establishing the diagnosis of DIC. Another method, the waveform aPTT, has been found to be both a sensitive and specifi c detector of DIC in adults.

Another potential therapy is the recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2 (rNAPc2) which is a potent inhibitor of the tissue factorfactor VIIa complex. Its mechanism of action is distinct from tissue factor pathway inhibitor. In a phase 1 study in healthy, male volunteers, intravenous rNAPc2 was found to be safe and well tolerated. A single dose completely blocked endotoxin-induced thrombin generation without affecting the fi brinolytic response and attenuated the endotoxin-induced rise in IL-10, without affecting other cytokines. Blockade of IL-6 is another therapeutic consideration. Since IL-6 is postulated to be responsible for tissue factor expression in mononuclear and endothelial cells during severe sepsis, it is plausible that IL-6 blockade may inhibit activation of the coagulation cascade. Based on encouraging results in primates, a randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled trial of a monoclonal anti-IL-6 antibody was conducted in healthy volunteers who received a lipopolysaccharide infusion. Unfortunately, the use of the IL-6 antagonist failed to decrease lipopolysaccharide-induced tissue factor mRNA transcription or plasma concentrations of any of the downstream coagulation factors.

Antithrombin is one of the most important physiologic inhibitors of coagulation, and patients with DIC almost invariably have an acquired defi ciency. The administration of antithrombin concentrate has been extensively studied and utilized in the treatment of DIC for over 25 years.

However, in a randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial in 2,314 adult patients with severe sepsis (the KyberSept Trial), high-dose antithrombin therapy had no effect on 28-day all cause mortality when administered within 6 h of the onset of sepsis, and, was associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage when administered with heparin. A post hoc subgroup analysis suggested a treatment benefi t of antithrombin in the subgroup of patients not receiving concomitant heparin. Available data is limited in pediatrics. However, in an open, randomized, controlled trial of 109 children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 37 patients were treated with supraphysiologic doses of antithrombin to prevent thromboembolism.

Generally, the body produces approximately 35,000 platelets per microliter of blood each day to maintain a steady state platelet count in the range of 150,000-350,000/ m L. Steady state platelet counts of this magnitude are more than that needed for routine hemostasis, and thus, provide a surplus for times of excess platelet loss or consumption. Studies have suggested that a platelet count of at least 7,000/ m L is necessary to support vascular integrity. Although platelets have several growth regulators, thrombopoietin, a polypeptide glycoprotein that shares signifi cant homology with erythropoietin, is the most important modulator of the platelet count.",

These younger, larger platelets may have better function than older platelets and the larger membrane area per platelet partially compensates for decreased platelet numbers. Thrombocytopenia secondary to increased destruction can be divided into immune or non-immune causes. Among the immune causes, infections of all types (viral, bacterial, protozoan) appear to be the most common in the PICU. Among the non-immune group, DIC, vascular anomalies, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and catheter-related thromboses are most common.

The physical exam is essentially unremarkable, notable for its absence of lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, and joint swelling. Platelet counts can frequently be very low (<10,000/ m L) and the WBC count is usually normal. For the same degree of thrombocytopenia, there is an apparent lower tendency to bleed with ITP because the platelets tend to be younger, larger (elevated MPV), and more effective than older, smaller platelets. A bleeding score based on the initial physical fi ndings has been established in pediatrics that allows for a semi-quantitative assessment of hemorrhage in children with ITP. Therapy for ITP at diagnosis remains controversial and guidelines have been published by both the British and American Societies of Hematology. In the event of severe, lifethreatening bleeding, platelet transfusions, steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and even splenectomy may be considered. Platelet transfusions are only indicated for life-threatening hemorrhage in ITP. Postulated mechanisms for steroid effi cacy include stabilization of vascular integrity, decreased synthesis of autoantibodies, and decreased clearance of antibody-coated platelets by white blood cells. IVIG works by blocking Fc receptor-mediated clearance of antibody-coated platelets by mononuclear, phagocytic cells. IVIG also seems to provide immune-modulation of the phagocytic system. Intravenous anti-D immune globulin has also been offered as a potential therapy for ITP, but should be used with caution in the setting of a decreased hemoglobin concentration or hemolysis.",

Hemostasis is therefore based on a critical balance between opposite forces that regulate fi brin formation and dissolution. Procoagulant mechanisms and natural anticoagulant inhibitors are intrinsically related in a delicate equilibrium that can be disturbed towards coagulation due to an inherited or acquired condition that will either lead to excessive prothrombotic stimuli or lack of proper coagulation inhibition. Overall, thrombin is the most powerful procoagulant protein in this system and the goal of the coagulation cascade is to generate thrombin and to promote the formation of a stable clot.

The increased incidence in adolescence occurs at a time when the coagulation profi le is transitioning to adult values. It is associated with an increased capacity for thrombin generation, a decrease in the coagulation inhibitor, alpha 2-macroglobulin, and an increase in acquired risk factors (e.g. smoking, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, use of oral contraceptives, pregnancy and obesity).

In adults, a strong association between these inherited prothrombotic conditions and VTE has been demonstrated. However, the infl uence of these disorders on the development of VTE in children is just beginning to be studied and understood. Table 38 -5 delineates the combined fi ndings of two published pediatric series of the prevalence of inherited prothrombotic conditions in children with VTE. These predisposing conditions may or may not be expressed as thrombosis, depending on environmental insults, the strength and number of predisposing factors, and the presence of other genetic abnormalities associated with hypercoagulability. There are some data to suggest that in children with VTE, the presence of a genetic prothrombotic disorder is a strong predictor of a recurrent episode. However, in two separate reports, the presence of a genetic prothrombotic disorder was found to not be associated with recurrent thrombosis in children. This difference may be related to the population studied, the ethnic background of the patients, the underlying medical conditions, and the type of thrombotic event (e.g. CVC-related thrombosis). Large family studies of thrombophilia (including antithrombin defi ciency, protein C defi ciency, protein S defi ciency, factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutations) have found a negligible incidence of thrombosis in children less than 15 years of age. A recent meta-analysis suggested that thrombophilia traits are a signifi cant risk factor in the development of the fi rst onset of DVT in children. In addition, with the exceptions of factor V Leiden and lipoprotein (a), these traits are also signifi cant risk factors for DVT recurrence.

In children, it carries an odds ratio (OR) for fi rst onset VTE of 9.44 (95% CI: 3.34-26.66; p<0.0001). It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with two types of abnormalities: one associated with reduced plasma levels of a functionally normal AT (Type I), and the other covering the two types of dysfunctional AT (Type II) (active-site defect and heparin binding-site defect). AT exerts its anticoagulant effect primarily by inactivating thrombin and factor Xa. AT bound to heparan sulfate molecules of the vascular endothelium inactivates thrombin, factor Xa, factor IXa, and factor XIa. It accomplishes this by forming a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with the activated clotting factor. Of note, AT levels are approximately half the normal adult levels at birth and increase to adult values by 6 months of life. Interestingly, levels of another thrombin inhibitor, alpha 2-macroglobulin, are elevated at birth and remain elevated through the second decade of life perhaps rendering a protective effect against thromboembolism during these years. Individuals with heterozygous AT deficiency usually present with venous thrombosis in early adulthood; while homozygous Type I AT defi ciency is likely incompatible with life. Homozygous AT-Type II is rare, and is associated with an extremely high risk of VTE during childhood. There are several acquired causes of AT defi ciency including DIC, liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, oral contraceptives, asparaginase therapy, and heparin therapy.

Protein C, a vitamin K dependent protein, is activated when thrombin binds to the endothelial cell receptor thrombomodulin. Once protein C is activated, it exerts its anticoagulant effect by inactivating factor VIIIa and factor Va ( Fig. 38-5 ) . Protein S is required for the above reactions. Protein C is produced in the liver and there are two primary types of protein C defi ciency. The fi rst is associated with reduced levels of functionally normal protein C. In the second, there is a normal amount of protein C, but it is dysfunctional with either decreased coagulation or amidolytic function. Protein C levels are also approximately half the adult norm at birth rising to adult levels by adolescence. In general, homozygous protein C defi ciency presents within hours of birth with life-threatening thrombotic complications including purpura fulminans as well as cerebral and ocular thromboses.

If other causes of decreased protein C levels can be excluded, a level \u00a3 55% suggests a genetic deficiency in adults, but not in prepubescent children where age-appropriate values are recommended. Repeat analysis and assessment of other family members should be performed to secure the diagnosis with certainty. Other causes of decreased protein C levels include DIC, liver disease, severe infection (notably meningococcemia), ARDS, asparaginase therapy, surgery, and coumadin therapy. Protein S, another vitamin K dependent protein, is an important cofactor for protein C. Protein S enhances the binding of protein C to phospholipid-containing membranes and accelerates the inactivation of factor VIIIa and factor Va. Protein S is synthesized by hepatocytes and megakaryocytes. Normally, 60% of protein S is complexed to a complement binding protein, C4b-BP, which neutralizes its ability (Fig. 38-5 ) . Hereditary protein S defi ciency is also inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and has a clinical presentation similar to protein C defi ciency. Protein S defi ciency is associated with an OR of 5.77 (95% CI: 3.03-10.97; p<0.0001) for fi rst onset VTE in children. There are three distinct forms of this deficiency: Type I has decreased total and free protein S levels with concomitant decreased function; Type II has normal total and free levels, but it is dysfunctional; Type III has sufficient total levels, but decreased free protein S, and therefore, decreased function. Interestingly, levels in neonates are only 30% of adult levels, but C4b-BP levels are also decreased, and thus, function is basically normal. Several acquired factors result in decreased levels including pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, human immunodefi ciency virus and varicella infections, liver disease and asparaginase therapy. In light of these acquired defi ciencies, repeat sampling and family testing is required for defi nitive diagnosis. Acute thromboembolic events including DIC result in increased C4b-BP levels, and therefore, decreased protein S activity.

The antiphospholipid antibodies comprise a group of heterogeneous IgG, IgM or IgA antibodies that are developed as either a primary phenomenon (i.e. antiphospholipid antibody syndrome) or secondary to an acute infection, an autoimmune disorder, or to medications. It is usually an acquired condition that manifests clinically as thrombosis (venous and/or arterial), thrombocytopenia, livido reticularis, and/or pregnancy loss. It can be divided into two broad types: the lupus anticoagulant and the anticardiolipin antibody syndromes. The name antiphospholipid is actually a misnomer, since the antibodies are mostly directed against proteins in combination with the ionic, negatively charged phospholipids (i.e. phosphatidylserine). There are several possible mechanisms to explain the procoagulant state including inhibition of the protein C system (acquired protein C resistance) as well as abnormal interactions with the complement system or with annexin V. The assays used to detect such abnormalities are classically divided into solid phase and fl uid, clot-based assays. In the former, solid phase assays containing antibodies directed towards B2-glycoprotein-1 (B2GP-1) and anticardiolipin antibodies are detected by ELISA. In the latter, phospholipid-dependent coagulation assays are inhibited ' in vitro ' by the presence of the antiphospholipid antibodies leading to prolonged clotting times. In the past, lupus anticoagulant was usually identifi ed in children by a prolonged aPTT during pre-surgical screening. However, as more laboratories are now using lupus-insensitive reagents, a prolonged aPTT cannot reliably detect lupus anticoagulant. In testing for lupus anticoagulant, it is important for the laboratory to adhere to the guidelines published by the ISTH. In essence, at least two screening tests for a lupus anticoagulant should be performed. In the event of a detected abnormality, a mixing study should be performed to demonstrate that the abnormal test is due to an inhibitor rather than a clotting factor defi ciency. Moreover, the inhibitory activity of the antibodies needs to be neutralized by an excess of phospholipids. In children, these antibodies are commonly transient; however, there are instances in which these fi ndings persist.",

Moreover, extrapolation of adult thrombosis data may not be appropriate as there are clear differences between children and adults. For example, although increasingly recognized, thrombosis in children is a relatively rare event in comparison to adults. Several factors for this decreased risk in children have been postulated including differences in the coagulation profi le, a decreased potential for thrombin generation and a vascular endothelium that has not endured years of potentially damaging exposures. Moreover, in children, vascular endothelial cells express more heparin cofactor 2 than adults potentially contributing to the decreased risk of VTE.

            "text": "The fundamental pathophysiology of SCD was long thought to be dependent on the obstruction of the microcirculation as a consequence of impaired erythrocyte plasticity during capillary transit. It is now recognized that the actual mechanism is much more complicated, although the polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin S resulting in less deformable cells remains the primary event in the pathogenesis of SCD. This polymerization occurs as a result of the substitution of valine for glutamic acid allowing complimentary globin chains to bind, forming rope-like fi bers that align with others to form a bundle, distorting the red cell into a classic crescent or sickled form. This polymerization is dependent on the intraerythrocytic hemoglobin S concentration, the degree of cell deoxygenation, the pH, and the intracellular concentration of hemoglobin F. Interestingly, the process of polymerization is slow relative to transit times through the capillary bed, and thus, many cells do not undergo polymerization. However, if transit times in the capillary bed are prolonged, then the red cells, as a result of exposure to lower oxygen tensions for longer periods of time, almost all undergo polymerization resulting in less deformable cells. These polymer-containing cells are trapped in the slow fl owing venular side of the microcirculation. This sludging eventually leads to the formation of heterocellular aggregates of leukocytes and poorly deformable erythrocytes that adhere to the endothelium. These aggregates fuel the process of vasoocclusion by creating further local hypoxia, increased transit times, increased hemoglobin S polymer formation, and propagation of the occlusion. Several other factors contribute to the vaso-occlusive pathophysiology of SCD. For example, leukocytes migrate though endothelial gap junctions, up-regulating infl ammation in the microvasculature. In fact, the role of leukocytes in SCD is now well recognized by both clinical and animal data. Elevated granulocyte counts are predictive of disease severity and mortality, and an elevated baseline white blood cell count is an independent risk factor for the occurrence of acute chest syndrome and cerebral infarction among patients with SCD. Moreover, abnormal cation homeostasis via a number of mechanisms results in red cell dehydration and membrane damage resulting in dense, irreversibly deformed cells. This not only contributes to vaso-occlusion, but may also contribute to the hemolytic anemia of SCD. Additionally, the interaction between the heterocellular adhesion at the venular level and the activation of abnormal cation homeostasis is accentuated by infections, hemolysis, and other proinfl ammatory states common to SCD and its sequelae. Finally, the dysregulation of vasomotor tone favoring vasoconstriction via the down-regulation of nitric oxide-mediated vasodilatation and other mechanisms further exacerbates vasoocclusion.",

Continuous pulse oximetry should be utilized to assess for hypoxia and supplemental oxygen should be administered to all patients with any degree of hypoxemia. Also, laboratory values often worsen after the initial diagnosis despite aggressive intervention suggesting the need for serial monitoring. Hemoglobin concentrations should be measured and the fraction of hemoglobin S should be determined and utilized in the management of ACS with a goal of maintaining a hemoglobin S concentration <30%. Most centers advocate early transfusion to interrupt the pathophysiologic processes that lead to ACS. These early transfusions will not only increase oxygen carrying capacity, but may also decrease the percentage of hemoglobin S, improve blood rheology, and decrease intrapulmonary shunting. Packed RBC transfusions should be used judiciously, however, as increasing the hemoglobin concentration above 11 g/dL may increase blood viscosity, worsen ACS and increase the possibility of a cerebrovascular accident. Exchange transfusions may be more useful minimizing the risk of increasing blood viscosity and more rapidly decreasing the fraction of hemoglobin S. Some centers advocate using automated red blood cell exchange transfusion, or erythrocytapheresis, in treating HbSS disease. This process replaces sickle cells with normal cells, thereby decreasing the percentage of hemoglobin S Most centers advocate early RBC transfusion to interrupt the pathophysiologic processes that lead to ACS with a goal of maintaining a hemoglobin S concentration <30%. while maintaining a net balance in iron accumulation. In addition, the use of phenotypically matched packed red cell units may be benefi cial. The use of these phenotypically matched transfusions results in only a 1% rate of alloimmunization; considerably lower than the 7% rate associated with standard transfusions. In light of the data suggesting that nearly 30% of ACS is associated with an infection, and the diffi culty in distinguishing between infectious and non-infectious etiologies, empiric antibiotic use is important. In view of the likely pathogens, appropriate coverage should include a macrolide antibiotic and a second or third generation cephalosporin. Vancomycin may be needed in areas with a prevalence of penicillin resistant pneumococcus. The appropriate attention to analgesia and hydration is also important. Inadequate analgesia may result in splinting, shallow respirations, and hypoventilation. Excessive analgesic use may result in sedation, poor respiratory effort, and hypoventilation. Both scenarios will result in worsening of the ACS. Incentive spirometry should be utilized during pain crises and should be a standard of care for surgical admissions among these patients. Volume depletion may result in further vasoconstriction and increased blood viscosity while overhydration may have its own deleterious effects. Placement of a central venous catheter with central venous pressure monitoring may assist in maintaining optimal hydration.",

Table 38 -8 depicts the factors associated with an increased risk of cerebral vasculopathy in SCD. These patients have a continued arterial disease with intimal hyperplasia, fi broblast and smooth muscle proliferation, and the potential for eventual thrombus formation that commonly involves the internal carotid, the middle cerebral, and/or the arteries of the Circle of Observations in young children during steady state, not recently transfused and not on chemotherapy (hydroxycarbamide).

These pathophysiologic changes increase the rate of blood fl ow through the middle cerebral artery. The rate of blood fl ow through the middle cerebral artery can be measured by transcranial doppler ultrasound and this has been found to be a useful index for monitoring the severity of neurovascular disease in these patients. Treatment of a cerebrovascular accident in this setting consists of an immediate exchange transfusion to reduce the percentage of hemoglobin S to less than 30%. In addition, standard neuroprotective interventions should be implemented to prevent an ischemic cascade. Long-term hypertransfusion therapy to keep the hemoglobin S percentage to less than 30 has been shown to reduce the incidence of a repeat stroke from 50% to 10% in a 3-year follow-up study. However, recent studies have reported the occurrence of silent infarcts despite transfusion therapy. In one report, 18 of 40 patients were found to have progressive cerebral infarction without overt clinical signs or symptoms with one patient requiring revascularization surgery.",

The microvasculature occlusion tends to occur in bones involved in marrow production (such as long bones, ribs, sternum, and pelvis) usually with multiple sites being involved simultaneously. The pain is mediated via activation of nociceptive afferent nerve fi bers. This microvascular involvement with its associated pain may persist, mimicking osteomyelitis.

The goals of therapy should be to prevent the formation of uric acid and to augment its elimination. Malignant cells, because of their high cellular activity and turnover, contain large quantities of nucleic acids that are rapidly released into the bloodstream during tumor lysis. These purine nucleic acids are initially converted to hypoxanthine, and then, into uric acid via the enzyme xanthine oxidase (Fig. 38-7 ) . Allopurinol, a structural analog of hypoxanthine, is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase. By competitively inhibiting xanthine oxidase, allopurinol decreases production of uric acid and results in a decrease in systemic uric acid levels ( Fig. 38-7 ) . However, allopurinol has three key limitations. First, it only prevents the formation of new uric acid and does not enhance the elimination of uric acid formed prior to its administration. Second, it increases the levels of both xanthine and hypoxanthine, increasing the potential for xanthine crystallization and obstructive uropathy since xanthine is even less soluble in urine than uric acid. Fortunately, this potential complication is rarely clinically manifested. Third, allopurinol reduces the degradation of other purines requiring dose reductions in patients receiving medications such as 6-mercaptopurine.",

Each cylinder contains straw-colored clear plasma at the top, a thick layer of white leukemic cells in the middle, and a thin layer of red cells at the bottom. The highly cellular nature of Burkitt lymphoma is evident in Panel B (Burkitt lymphoma of the appendix, hematoxylin and eosin). Lysis of cancer cells (Panel C) releases DNA, phosphate, potassium, and cytokines. DNA released from the lysed cells is metabolized into adenosine and guanosine, both of which are converted into xanthine. Xanthine is then oxidized by xanthine oxidase, leading to the production of uric acid, which is excreted by the kidneys. When the accumulation of phosphate, potassium, xanthine, or uric acid is more rapid than excretion, the tumor lysis syndrome develops. Cytokines cause hypotension, infl ammation, and acute kidney injury, which increase the risk for the tumor lysis syndrome. The bidirectional dashed line between acute kidney injury and tumor lysis syndrome indicates that acute kidney injury increases the risk of the tumor lysis syndrome by reducing the ability of the kidneys to excrete uric acid, xanthine, phosphate, and potassium. By the same token, development of the tumor lysis syndrome can cause acute kidney injury by renal precipitation of uric acid, xanthine, and calcium phosphate crystals and by crystal independent mechanisms. Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase (Panel D) and prevents the conversion of hypoxanthine and xanthine into uric acid, but does not remove existing uric acid. In contrast, rasburicase removes uric acid by enzymatically degrading it into allantoin, a highly soluble product that has no known adverse effects on health (Howard et al. 2011) function due to precipitation of calcium phosphate crystals in renal tubules. Therefore, alkalinization is not recommended in countries in which rasburicase is available to remove uric acid. A recombinant form of urate oxidase, rasburicase, catalyzes the conversion of uric acid to allantoin (Fig. 38-7 ) . Allantoin is signifi cantly more soluble in urine than uric acid, and readily excreted by the kidneys. Rasburicase is the treatment of choice to prevent tumor lysis syndrome in children at high risk for this metabolic complication because it effectively reduces uric acid levels within 4 h of administration and is more effective than allopurinol. Although the original, nonrecombinant form of the enzyme was associated with a high incidence of anaphylaxis, rasburicase is well tolerated with allergic reactions occurring in less than 1% of patients. It should not be used in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase defi ciency as it may induce a hemolytic anemia. Rasburicase may yield inaccurate determination of serum uric acid levels as it may continue to breakdown uric acid in the laboratory collecting tubes; a process that may be stopped by promptly placing the collecting tube on ice.",

Identifying patients at risk from these life-threatening complications is crucial. It is estimated that 7-19% of patients with a mediastinal mass will develop an airway complication with the induction of anesthesia or deep sedation. The pathophysiology of this airway compromise with anesthesia is multifactorial. With the induction of anesthesia, lung volumes are decreased secondary to weakened or abolished inspiratory muscle tone and increased abdominal muscle tone. Additionally, bronchial smooth muscle is relaxed resulting in increased compressibility of the large airways and decreased expiratory fl ow rates. This exacerbates the effects of the extrinsic compression. Third, the use of neuromuscular blockade eliminates the caudad movement of the diaphragm observed during spontaneous respiration, thereby, decreasing the transpleural pressure gradient. The transpleural gradient dilates the airways during inspiration, and when decreased, results in decreased airway caliber also augmenting the effect of the extrinsic compression. Additionally, supine positioning may result in further cephalad displacement of the diaphragm and increased central blood volume.

Decreases in the peak expiratory fl ow rate (PEFR), total lung capacity, forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s have all been reported in patients with a mediastinal mass suggesting both obstructive and restrictive defi cits. The PEFR appears to be a useful predicator of airway compromise with a predicted PEFR <50% identifying patients at high risk for airway obstruction with the use of anesthesia. Also, a 12% decrease in pulmonary function can be anticipated when placing the child with a mediastinal mass in the supine, rather than, upright position. It is important to remember that these tests require patient cooperation in both the upright and supine position often making their use impractical particularly in children. Figure 38 -9 demonstrates the fl ow volume loops of a child with a mediastinal mass before and after therapy. Echocardiography is another dynamic test that may be used to assess cardiac function, the presence of a pericardial effusion, impending tamponade, and the integrity of the pulmonary outfl ow tract.",

It is prudent to discuss the condition with all responsible clinical services (nursing, oncology, anesthesia, surgery, pathology, radiation oncology, critical care) to assure the optimal course of action and the appropriate, timely handling of diagnostic specimens. A patient presenting with, or acutely developing, airway obstruction from a mediastinal mass is in a precarious condition of the highest magnitude. Several techniques may be used to decrease the obstruction and/or improve air fl ow emergently. Repositioning the child from the supine into the upright, lateral, or prone position may be of benefi t. Heliox may also improve air movement through the narrowed airway. Bag valve mask ventilation in a spontaneously breathing patient using high positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been reported to be useful. If intubation is required, it is preferable to have it performed in the controlled environment of the operating room as described below. If emergent intubation must be performed outside the operating room, it should be performed without the use of neuromuscular blockade by the most experienced person. Reinforced endotracheal tubes of suffi cient length to extend beyond the area of tracheal compression should be utilized. If at all possible, both a fl exible and rigid fi beroptic bronchoscope should be available and cardiopulmonary bypass should be on standby. Once successfully intubated, the use of PEEP, repositioning of the tube, and/or repositioning of the patient may be needed to facilitate optimal air movement. Although never ideal, presumptive, pre-biopsy therapy may be required in cases of severe airway compromise. Clearly, this obviates the risks of anesthesia and delays in treatment associated with a diagnostic work-up. However, it may reduce the ability to make a defi nitive diagnosis, result in unnecessary therapy, and lead to improper staging of the disease. Pre-biopsy radiotherapy has also been found to obscure the diagnosis.",

Such procedures may be performed under local anesthesia or with light sedation, but with extreme caution nonetheless. For example, bone marrow aspiration may be used to ascertain a diagnosis, particularly for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Unfortunately, this test may have less utility in other patient populations. Thoracentesis is another diagnostic test that may also be useful in determining the etiology of a mediastinal mass when associated with a pleural effusion. Among malignant masses, pleural effusions are more common in lymphoblastic lymphoma than Hodgkin disease and this diagnosis has been secured using cytological and fl ow cytometric analysis of the pleural fl uid. Fine needle aspiration and core needle biopsies of superfi cial lymphadenopathy have also been used to diagnose lymphoblastic lymphoma precluding the need for more invasive procedures.

First, secure intravenous access must be established and consideration should be given to lower extremity placement as the superior vena cava may have poor infl ow due to extrinsic compression. Next, pre-anesthesia sedation or narcotics should be avoided. Both a fl exible and rigid fi beroptic bronchoscope should be available and cardiopulmonary bypass should be on standby. The rigid, ventilating bronchoscope is the instrument of choice for the unstable airway. However, it is important to note that if the mediastinal mass is compressing the airway near or beyond the carina, a rigid bronchoscope may still be ineffective as it may not be able to open airways past the occlusion. Induction of anesthesia should be performed in an upright position; however, if the patient cannot tolerate this, then a lateral or prone position should be considered as supine positioning may be associated with worsening of the obstruction. Anesthesia should only be deepened once it is demonstrated that the patient can be easily ventilated with a bag mask set-up. The patient should be intubated with a reinforced endotracheal tube that is passed beyond the obstructed region. In the event of an acute airway occlusion, several maneuvers may be implemented that may be life-saving. Anesthetic effects should be reversed promptly and the patient returned to spontaneous ventilation. Repositioning of the child, in particular utilizing a prone position, may alter the effect of the mass on the airway and facilitate air movement. The ventilating rigid bronchoscope may be advanced beyond the area of obstruction. An emergent thoracotomy with bulk resection of the tumor may be performed to relieve pressure on the airway. However, this should be performed only in extremis as the bleeding and tissue edema involved may actually worsen the effects upon the mediastinum. If necessary, the patient may be placed on cardiopulmonary bypass or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.",

Frequent assessment of fl uid balance with particular attention to urine output is critical. Daily weights are used at some centers.

In addition to well established hematologic disorders that may present with critical illness such as sickle cell disease, DIC, HUS, and TTP, the signifi cance of hematologic perturbations in other critical conditions is just beginning to be understood. The prevalence of such conditions as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and thromboembolism in the PICU is being established and their impact on outcomes remains an area for much research. Moreover, as anti-neoplastic therapy improves survival among pediatric patients with cancer, the need for, and importance of, critical services for these children will continue to expand. A better understanding of the critical care issues confronting these children such as tumor lysis syndrome and mediastinal mass management will only result in better outcomes. ",
