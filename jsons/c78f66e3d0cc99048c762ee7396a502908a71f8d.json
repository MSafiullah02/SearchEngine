Nipah virus is considered a biosafety level-4 pathogen and is listed as a select agent with high risk for public health and security due to its high mortality rate in people and the lack of effective vaccines or therapies. The natural reservoir for Nipah virus and related members of the genus Henipavirus are fruit bats of the genus Pteropus. Nipah virus emerged in Malaysia in 1998 as a porcine neurologic and respiratory disease that spread to humans who had contact with live, infected pigs. Research reviewed in this paper suggests that anthropogenic factors, including agricultural expansion and intensification, were the underlying causes of its emergence. Nipah virus has caused five subsequent outbreaks between 2001 and 2005 in Bangladesh. Here, it appears to have spilled over directly from bats to humans, and person-to-person transmission is evident suggesting a heightened public health risk.",

Both viruses appear to have fruit bat (Pteropus species) reservoirs [14\u2022,15] , and both initially emerged via domestic animal amplifier hosts (horses for Hendra virus; pigs for Nipah virus), although some of the recent outbreaks in Bangladesh may have involved direct transmission between bats and humans [13\u2022\u2022] .",

The outbreak of encephalitic disease in pigs spread through peninsular Malaysia as infected animals were shipped between farms from north to south and into Singapore. There were a total of 265 human cases of Nipah virus infection in Malaysia and a further 11 in Singapore [16] . Of those infected, nearly 40% (105) died. Almost all cases were directly associated with the pig industry, suggesting that Nipah virus in Malaysia is either unable or unlikely to spill-over from its reservoir directly to humans. This was subsequently supported by a serologic survey of Tioman Islanders who live in close proximity to the population of the Island fruit bat Pteropus hypomelanus from which Nipah virus was isolated. This survey did not find evidence of exposure to Nipah virus in any of the 153 people tested, suggesting that the risk of direct transmission from bats to humans is low [17] . The origins of the outbreak were in a large, intensively-managed pig farm in Ipoh, Malaysia, where the first known pig and human cases occurred as early as January 1997, prior to the large outbreak in the Nipah region of Malaysia [11,14\u2022] (Field et al., unpublished data) .",

Typical lesions included widespread vasculitis, particularly in the CNS, heart, lung, and kidney, with multinucleated giant endothelial cells sometimes present in these organs. Viral inclusion bodies were present in the cytoplasm and nuclei of neuronal cells. Viral antigen was seen by IHC staining in the blood vessels of most organs, particularly where vasculitis was present. Many of the pathologic findings of acute fatal Nipah virus encephalitis are common to other encephalitic diseases; however, the presence of syncitial multinucleated endothelial cells is characteristic of Nipah and Hendra virus infection [ Epidemiologic data suggest four major differences between the outbreaks in Bangladesh and those in Malaysia and Singapore: 1) Nipah virus has spilled over into the human population repeatedly in five independent outbreaks; 2) spillover appears to be seasonal; 3) spillover occurred without livestock amplifier hosts; and 4) there is strong evidence of human-to-human transmission. Genetic characterization of the Nipah virus isolated from humans in Bangladesh in 2004 showed it to be distinct from the Malaysian strain, with the two viruses having approximately 92% nucleotide sequence homology [21] .",

Although ribavirin therapy may have been somewhat effective, there are currently no commercially available vaccines or approved therapeutics for Nipah virus. Nipah and Hendra virus have homologous attachment glycoproteins that are associated with virus to host-cell binding (G) and fusion (F), suggesting that these viruses may utilize common host-cell receptors [26, 27] . Ephrin-B2 was recently identified as a cell-surface receptor that permits both Nipah and Hendra virus viral fusion and cell entry. Ephrin-type receptor proteins are found in most human tissues. Ephrin-B2 is highly expressed in vascular and respiratory tissue, which is where Nipah virus was commonly found in patients who died from Nipah virus encephalitis [18\u2022,28\u2022] . Fusion inhibitors that block the expression of Ephrin-B2 could be used in future vaccines or therapeutic agents of clinical benefit [28\u2022 ].",

The most obvious clinical feature in young pigs was a severe, nonproductive cough, sometimes called a \"barking cough.\" Neurologic signs included tremors, hind-end weakness with spastic paresis, and general ataxia. Boars and sows presented with a similar syndrome that included excessive flow of saliva, nasal discharge, and abortion primarily in early-pregnancy sows [29] . Nipah virus is thought to be highly infectious among pigs, most likely spread through aerosolization of virus due to coughing and mechanical contact with oronasal secretions. This is presumed to be the primary mechanism of transmission to humans as well, although virus was isolated from pig urine and feces [29] . In some pigs, virus was present in the CNS despite a clinically normal appearance [30] . Sub-clinical infection occurred in pigs during the outbreak, and pigs were able to transmit the virus during sub-clinical infections [31] . Experimental infections also showed that pigs can maintain Nipah virus sub-clinically and are able to transmit the infection in this state [31] . The infection rate among pigs was close to 100%, and mortality was between 1% and 5% [29].",

Neutralizing antibodies to Nipah virus were found in five bat species in Malaysia. Seroprevalence was highest in Pteropus hypomelanus and Pteropus vampyrus [33] . Subsequently, Nipah virus was recovered from the urine of P. hypomelanus and from fruit partially eaten and discarded by bats, suggesting that urine and saliva may be significant routes of excretion [14\u2022 ]. The incidence of Nipah virus infection in bats is unknown; however, data from a longitudinal study of Hendra virus in Australian fruit bats suggest that it is likely to be low (Field, unpublished observations [34] , and the virus has been isolated from flying foxes in Cambodia [35] . This supports previous hypotheses that henipaviruses likely exist across the entire global distribution of pteropid bats [7] . Figure 1 shows the global range of genus Pteropus and indicates the known distribution of henipaviruses in bats and humans. Black flying foxes (Pteropus alecto) are known to co-roost with the P. hypomelanus and P. vampyrus in parts of Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, and in turn, these species at the northern extent of their range are known to mix with P. giganteus, whose distribution extends eastward (from Thailand and Burma) across to India and Bangladesh [36, 37] . Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analyses suggest that both Hendra and Nipah viruses have co-evolved with their fruit bat hosts from an ancient, common ancestor [38, 39] . As would be expected for such a long co-evolutionary relationship, henipaviruses have relatively low pathogenicity in their fruit bat reservoir hosts. Australian fruit bats (Pteropus poliocephalus) experimentally inoculated with Hendra virus in some cases developed sub-clinical infections [40] , and no clinical signs were reported in bats inoculated with Nipah virus (Halpin et al., unpublished observations) .",

The population of P. vampyrus in Peninsular Malaysia has likely declined in recent times due to habitat loss and hunting [41, 43, 44] . Anecdotal evidence suggests that P. vampyrus moves from Sumatra to Malaysia and it seems likely that the population is contiguous to some extent [43] . Deforestation is severe in Sumatra, and it is likely that this has also led to a lowering of the total reservoir population, and perhaps a change in migration patterns. Loss of natural food resources through deforestation may have made P. vampyrus more dependent on cultivated fruits such as durian, rambutan, langsat, and jambu air [43] . These fruits were cultivated on and near the farm where the index cases of Nipah virus were found [45] . ",

At the time of the outbreak, fruit trees were routinely planted in close proximity to pig sties. Planting orchards provided additional income for farmers, but an unintended result was the attraction of flying foxes onto their properties. On the large pig farm where Nipah virus infection first occurred in pigs and then humans (the \"index farm\"), branches from fruit trees frequently hung over the pig enclosures [45] . The isolation of Nipah virus from chewed fruit dropped by bats suggests that ingestion of bat saliva-or urine-contaminated fruit by pigs at the index farm may have led to the spillover of the virus into pigs [45] .",

A recent paper hypothesized that spill-over was a one-time event driven by a severe El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation drought and anthropogenic forest fires in Indonesia that forced migration of Nipah virusinfected bats to Malaysia [45] . This hypothesis implies that bats were newly arrived in the Ipoh area in early 1998, just prior to the outbreak, leading to the emergence of Nipah virus. Our surveillance and tracking data suggest that Pteropodid bats are consistently found in the Ipoh area, even in nondrought years and that P. vampyrus regularly move between Sumatra and mainland Malaysia in the absence of severe climatic conditions or haze (Epstein et al., unpublished data). Furthermore, several Nipah virus encephalitis cases associated with the index farm were retrospectively diagnosed as occurring in early 1997, prior to the El Ni\u00f1o-related drought (Field et al., unpublished data) . Thus, the \"why now\" of Nipah spillover must be considered as largely random: transmission from flying foxes to pigs, and subsequent pig-to-human transmission, may have occurred on multiple occasions over an unknown time span.",

First, models show that spillover of the virus from bats to pigs on an intensively managed farm such as the index farm leads to a large epidemic in pigs that quickly burns itself out [46] . Such an epidemic would be expected to produce few human cases, and those that occurred would be highly clustered in both space and time. The cluster of cases on the index farm in 1997 follows this pattern. Subsequent reintroduction of the virus from bats into the pig popu-lation could have a variety of effects, depending on the timing of the spillover. The scenario that best explains the difference between the series of cases in 1997 and the 1998 to 1999 outbreak is that the virus was reintroduced into the pig population whereas a large proportion of the sows retained antibodies from previous exposure. Unlike young pigs, which are usually sent to market within 6 months after birth, sows are kept in the population up to 5 years for breeding purposes. After approximately 6 months, therefore, no previously exposed young pigs would remain in the population; sows and pigs young enough to maintain maternal antibodies, however, would be immune to infection. The difference in the force of infection compared with the earlier epidemic would permit the virus to circulate endemically within the pig population [46] . The long-term maintenance of the virus on a single, large pig farm would allow plenty of opportunity for spread beyond the index farm, producing more widespread cases in both pigs and humans.",

The distribution of Pteropus ranges from Madagascar eastward across the Indian Ocean islands, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia, and much of the Pacific islands, and includes some of the most densely populated regions on Earth.

The cow was not tested for Nipah virus, and so it is still unclear what role domestic animals play in Nipah virus transmission in Bangladesh [13\u2022\u2022]. Among 10 birds, 6 pigs, 4 dogs, 2 shrews, and 4 rodents tested in Meherpur and Naogaon, none had antibodies to Nipah Virus [13\u2022\u2022]. In Bangladesh there is evidence of person-to-person transmission of Nipah virus [13\u2022\u2022,23]. In the first outbreak, in the Meherpur district, the index patient died 6 days after developing symptoms. Five other persons in the household developed Nipah virus disease 10 to 18 days after the index case, and nine of the 13 infected people in this outbreak were relatives of the index case. Living with an infected person was a risk factor for illness (OR 4.80; 95% CI 1.23-18.8) [13\u2022\u2022]. In the Naogaon outbreak in January 2003, the head of one household became ill, followed 2 weeks later by his wife and three eldest daughters. All died of Nipah virus infection. In Goalando in January 2004, several cases occurred within the same household [24]. In the Faridpur outbreak between February and April 2004, the virus appears to have undergone four transmission cycles in people [23]. The most recent Nipah outbreak occurred in the Tangail District in north central Bangladesh in January 2005. Among 12 persons who met a case definition of outbreak-associated encephalitis, 11 (92%) died [23].",

Our recent studies have identified a high prevalence of antibodies to Nipah virus in colonies of both P. vampyrus and P. hypomelanus throughout peninsular Malaysia, suggesting that these bats are true reservoirs and that the virus is endemic to the region (Rahman et al., unpublished observations). In Bangladesh, a serologic survey of domestic and wild animals undertaken after the 2001 Meherpur and 2003 Naogaon outbreaks identified evidence of infection only in bats (Pteropus giganteus) [13\u2022\u2022,24]. In Meherpur and Naogaon in 2003, serum samples were collected from 10 birds, six pigs, two shrews, five rodents, and 56 bats including 44 P. giganteus. Antibodies against Nipah virus antigen were detected in two P. giganteus adult females. Serum specimens from all of the other animals were negative [13\u2022\u2022]. Concurrent serologic surveillance of P. giganteus in northern India in 2003 found that 54% had neutralizing antibodies to Nipah virus (Epstein et al., unpublished observations), suggesting that Nipah virus or a related crossneutralizing virus is present across the range of P. giganteus. Neutralizing antibodies to Nipah virus have been reported from P. vampyrus in Indonesia [33a] and Cambodia",
