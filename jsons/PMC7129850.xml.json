CNBr therefore cannot be used when internal methionines are present in the target protein, which fortunately is not the case for neither SARS-CoV E or IBV E. However, the \u03b2-barrel used as fusion protein contains four internal Met residues, and cleavage of the fusion construct with CNBr would produce in this case many fragments that could complicate purification.

Electrophysiological recordings were carried out with a Port-a-Patch automated patch clamp system (Nanion Technologies GmbH, Munich, Germany). First, a planar bilayer was obtained by applying 5 \u03bcl of GUV solution onto the borosilicate glass chips, \u223c1 \u03bcm aperture, in presence of a slightly negative pressure (\u221220 mbar). The formation of the planar lipid bilayer on the aperture provided a seal resistance of >10 G\u03a9. Then, proteoliposomes containing the protein were pipetted onto the planar lipid bilayer. Currents were amplified with Axon Patch 200B amplifier (Axon instruments, USA). The data were acquired by using Axon Digidata 1322A and analyzed with Clampfit (Axon instruments, USA).

The monomer of wild type SARS-CoV E migrated with its expected mobility in 4\u201312% Nu\u2013PAGE (\u223c8 kDa) together with several higher oligomers, and mutants SSS and AAA produced only monomers (Fig. 5\nA).

The difference between triple mutants and wild type in presence of DTT suggests that cysteine side chains are involved in SARS-CoV E inter-monomeric contacts, but this involvement does not necessarily imply the formation of disulfide bonds. The side chain of cysteine is more hydrophobic [46] than alanine or serine, and the latter residues may lead to different secondary structure propensities relative to cysteine [23], [24].",

For wild type full length SARS-CoV E no simple reversible association \u2018monomer:N-mer\u2019 model could be fitted to the data (N was tested from 2 to 15), probably because of the presence of disulfide bonds. However, in the presence of reductant TCEP, the data could be best fitted to a simple monomer-pentamer self-association model (Fig. 6A\u2013D), with log \nK\na\n = 17.5 \u00b1 0.2, similar to that obtained previously in similar conditions [19] for synthetic peptide TM8\u201337 in similar conditions. This suggests that the main contribution to pentamerization in SARS-CoV E is provided by the TM domain. The fact that we could fit the data in presence of TCEP to a monomer pentamer model demonstrates that disulfide bonds are not required to form pentamers. When we used the cysteine-less mutants (SSS or AAA) or IBV E and mutant AA, the data could still be fitted to a reversible monomer-pentamer equilibrium (not shown). For IBV E a good fit of the data could be obtained without the need of TCEP, consistent with the observation that no disulfide bonds were observed in SDS (Fig. 5C). Purified SARS-CoV E has channel activity in lipid bilayers, although the film was unstable and recordings could only be obtained at two potentials (Fig. 6E and F).",

Thus we obtained CD and FTIR spectra to assess the secondary structure of SARS-CoV E. The CD spectrum of SARS-CoV E protein incorporated in anionic SDS or lipid-like DPC detergent micelles showed characteristic minima at 208 nm and 222 nm (Fig. 7\nA), typical of \u03b1-helical conformation. This is confirmed by the infrared amide I band envelope (Fig. 7B) obtained after reconstitution of SARS-CoV E protein in lipidic membranes, which shows a predominant band centered at \u223c1655 cm\u22121, also characteristic of \u03b1-helices, although in some cases (e.g., DMPC) a small shoulder was observed consistent with some \u03b2-structure.",

From visual inspection, about 70% of the 1H\u201315N peaks can be detected. Using the triple cysteine mutant did not improve the quality of the spectra (not shown).

We stress the fact that (1) this is the first report that shows unequivocally that coronavirus envelope proteins (full length) are pentameric, and (2) that the mass spectroscopy determination of these proteins is by no means routine. Indeed, the fluctuation between measurements observed for SARS-CoV E was not observed previously in TM fragments of SARS-CoV E [18], [19], in proteolytic fragments after tryptic digestion (Supplementary File), or in similar viroporins, e.g., small hydrophobic (SH) protein from RSV [51], which do not form large aggregates in SDS and PFO gels.
