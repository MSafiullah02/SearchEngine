However, the bad things may occur simultaneously, such as, the spread of 2003 SARS and 2009 H1N1 influenza almost throughout the world. SARS involved 30 countries and regions, caused more than 8,000 patients, and 774 deaths [19, 20]. The H1N1 influenza virus quickly spread worldwide due to airplane travel. As of May 6, 2009, the virus had invaded in 23 countries including Mexico and the United States, and a total of 1,882 people were confirmed to be infected by it [3]. It then follows that the studies on the influence of infectious diseases transmission on the global population that formulates patchy models are more and more significant and practical.",

But for many mathematical models of infectious diseases in a patchy environment, the global stability of the endemic equilibrium is still an open problem. Motivated by this, in the present paper, a class of simple SIR models with susceptibles dispersal in a patchy environment is to be formulated and investigated the stability of the endemic equilibrium by constructing the Lyapunov function (also see [5, 6, 9\u201311, 13, 14]).",

The existence of equilibria is obtained and the basic reproduction numbers R01, R02, and R0 are defined. It is indicated that R01 and R02 are two important threshold parameters to determine the long-term behavior of the solutions of system (1). The disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and the disease ultimately dies out by applying the comparison principle of cooperative systems if the basic reproduction numbers both R01 and R02 are below unity. The disease persists in patch one and can be eradicated in patch two if R01 is above one, R02 is below one, and S21\u2217<S22\u2217. The disease persists in patch two and can be eradicated in patch one if R02 is above one, R01 is below one, and S12\u2217<S11\u2217.
