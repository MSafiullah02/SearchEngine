However, steroid-associated osteonecrosis frequently occurs as a result of high-dose corticosteroid treatments. Extravascular lipid-deposition is a major consent etiopathogenesis of steroid-associated osteonecrosis (Lieberman et al., 2003). It has been experimentally confirmed that lipid-lowering agent is able prevent steroid-associated osteonecrosis (Motomura et al., 2004). Epimedium-derived flavonoids have shown beneficial effect on prevention of steroid-associated osteonecrosis by inhibiting extravascular lipid-deposition in our previous experimental studies (Qin et al., 2006, Zhang et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2009). However, the underlying mechanism of Epimedium-derived flavonoids on inhibition of adipogenesis remains unknown.",

Adipocyte differentiation involves sequential activation of various transcription factors (MacDougald and Lane, 1995, Rosen and MacDougald, 2006). Cebpd and Cebpb are the earliest transcription factors induced by adipogenic stimuli, and they transcriptionally activate the Cebpa and Pparg genes through C/EBP regulatory elements in their proximal promoters (Gregoire et al., 1998). Cebpa and Pparg served as key transcriptional activators of adipogenesis promote expression of adipocyte-specific genes, such as Fabp4 and Lpl (Gregoire et al., 1998).",

            "text": "Desmethylicaritin is a metabolite of Epimedium-derived flavonoids identified in serum after its oral administration (Liu and Lou, 2004, Shen et al., 2007). It is classified as a phytoestrogen and exerts estrogenic-like activity (Wang and Lou, 2004, Ye et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2006), anti-inflammatory activity (Chen et al., 2008, Kim et al., 2009) and anti-oxidative activity (Wo et al., 2008). Recently, estrogen has been reported to inhibit adipogenesis by activating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling (Kanit et al., 2012). Accordingly, we hypothesize that desmethylicaritin may be able to inhibit adipogenesis via regulating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, i.e. a relevant mechanism to explain the role of Epimedium-derived flavonoids and also the potential use of desmethylicaritin as a novel phytochemical agent to prevent disorders involving lipid metabolism.",

It has been reported that steroids are evidently related to the control of the developmental program during adipocytic differentiation. In vitro, adipocytes increase with concentration of dexamethasone and duration of steroids therapy. Dexamethasone can directly stimulate differentiation of MSCs into adipocytes and accelerate lipids formation (Yin et al., 2006). Epimedium-derived flavonoids are able to inhibit extravascular lipid deposition during steroid-associated osteonecrosis (Zhang et al., 2007). In this study, we used preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells induced with insulin and dexamethason as in vitro models for studying the conversion of preadipocytes into adipocytes and exploring the mechanism of desmethylicaritin, a bioactive metabolite of Epimedium-derived flavonoids, on inhibition of adipogenesis.",

Indeed, it has been reported that activation of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling stimulates osteoblastogenesis and inhibits adipogenesis by modulating the relative levels of cell type specific transcription factors (Bennett et al., 2005). While inhibitory of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling does not influence the induction of the early adipogenic factors Cebpd and Cebpb, repressions of Cebpa and Pparg are suggested a primary mechanism by which Wnt signaling controls mesenchymal cell fate (Rosen et al., 2000; Bennett et al., 2005). Zhang et al. has found that flavonoids from Epimedium exert promotion effect on osteogenic differentiation that is partially via WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway (Zhang et al., 2010). Thus, findings of the present study confirm our hypothesis on the role of desmethylicaritin in regulating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway during adipogenesis.",

Wnt10b binds to frizzled (FZD1) receptors and LRP5/6 co-receptors leading to disheveled phosphorylation and Axin degradation, and in turn, results in hypophosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin, which accumulates in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to TCF/LEF transcription factors to activate WNT target genes and inhibited adipogenesis by suppressing CEBPA and PPARG (Bennett et al., 2005, Christodoulides et al., 2009). Our results showed that desmethylicaritin up-regulated the mRNA expression of Wnt10b (Fig. 4A). Further, western blot and immunofluoresence analysis confirmed that desmethylicaritin was able to promote nuclear translocation of \u03b2-cantinin, which might play an important role in suppressing adipogenesis. Hence, we infer that desmethylicaritin may inhibit adipocyte differentiation through activating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, which results in inhibition of the adipogenic transcription factors Cebpa and Pparg (Christodoulides et al., 2009).",

Locally, these phagocytic cells produce O2\u2212 that activates NF-\u03baB and JNK. Both inflammatory signaling pathways regulate cellular transcriptional events, thereby leading to greater production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and other pro-inflammatory mediators that further JNK and NF-\u03baB pathways through a feed-forward mechanism until glucocorticoids, the end products of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, limit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibit their effects on target tissues (Zappulla, 2008). This implies that the flavonoid desmethylicaritin might also sustain inflammation, a key survival mechanism which can be harmful when its transient, physiological adaptations are converted to a chronic, pathological state (Zappulla, 2008). Recent studies have however shown that the herb Sophora flavescens containing desmethylicaritin may exert anti-inflammatory effects by functioning as an inhibitor of the NF-\u03baB pathway through the suppression of redox-based PI3K activation and PEN inactivation (Kim et al., 2009). It has also been reported that desmethylicaritin interferes with JNK-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation thereby attenuating pro-inflammatory NO production (Chen et al., 2008). Nonetheless, desmethylicaritin might also affect the fate of erythrocytes, and this has been related to the risk factors for diabetes, obesity (Kristina et al., 2012), and metabolic syndrome, an increasingly prevalent condition in the Western world (Zappulla, 2008). Since humans are not exposed uniformly to single, pure chemicals, but rather to complex and variable mixtures of substances, some of which may also interact synergistically, in vitro studies might not be so reliable to justify a preventive, ever-lasting use of any kind of drugs, including supplements such as prenyl-flavonoid derivatives. Therefore, the synergistic effect of desmethylicaritin and other chemicals in the environment requires further exploration.",
