The original formulation contained albumin, which was later replaced by saccharose and glycine and registered in Germany as Beriate\u00ae P. This initial formulation had a FVIII concentration of 50 IU/mL and a specific activity of approximately 170 IU/mg protein. Subsequent advances in the production process enabled the solvent volume to be reduced and led to the launch in 1992 of Beriate\u00ae P with a FVIII concentration of 100 IU/mL and a mean specific activity of approximately 270 IU/mg protein. Other manufacturing developments have included a change in the diameter of the chromatography column to increase the FVIII yield, an improved purification process, and the optimization of the lyophilization programme for Beriate\u00ae P 500 and 1,000 IU FVIII.",
