However, the mechanism by which GA inhibits viral hepatic inflammatory injury is not completely understood. In this study, we found that, by consecutively treating mice with a traditional herbal recipe, licorice plays an important role in the detoxification of mice. We also employed a murine hepatitis virus (MHV) infection model to illustrate that GA treatment inhibited activation of hepatic inflammatory responses by blocking high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) cytokine activity. Furthermore, decreased HMGB1 levels and downstream signaling triggered by injection of a neutralizing HMGB1 antibody or TLR4 gene deficiency, also significantly protected against MHV-induced severe hepatic injury. Thus, our findings characterize GA as a hepatoprotective therapy agent in hepatic infectious disease not only by suppressing HMGB1 release and blocking HMGB1 cytokine activity, but also via an underlying viral-induced HMGB1-TLR4 immunological regulation axis that occurs during the cytokine storm.",

The GL compound consists of two molecules glucuronic acid and one molecule glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) [5] . GA is also a key hydrolysis product of GL and is a triterpenoid saponins with a molecular weight of 470.69 kDa ( Fig.1) . GA has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in different systems through multiple mechanisms, such as inhibitory effects on reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction and NF-\u03baB pathway activation [6, 7] .

Therefore, it was hypothesized that in a hepatotropic coronavirus model, GA may have different effects on virus replication and its protective function in tissue injury. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the presence of licorice serves as a hepatoprotective agent against potentially toxic bioactive herbal ingredients. Then we characterized the effectiveness of GA in inhibiting HMGB1 cytokine activity and suppressing the induction of inflammatory genes known to be involved in hepatic injury while assessing the involvement of HMGB1/TLR4 signaling in mediating tissue injury during viral hepatitis. There is a pressing need for new approaches to prevent and manage viral hepatitis, and we hope that a better understanding of GA function will allow for emergence of new therapeutic approaches in Western medicine.

Furthermore, serum ALT and AST levels increased significantly 21 days after the first injection in the TCM-L group as compared to control mice and the TCM+L group ( Fig. 2B-C) . Additionally, we examined the induction of IP-10 and IL-1\u03b2, two inflammatory cytokines induced during liver injury.

MHV causes hepatic and central nervous system diseases of varying severity, depending on the strain and is therefore used as a model for hepatitis, viral encephalitis, and demyelination. In our lab, we have established acute lethal and sub-lethal MHV infection models using the MHV-A59 virus strain, which is a moderately hepatotropic and neurotropic virus (Fig. S1 ). Murine survival studies suggested that administration of GA (20 mg/kg, i.p.) on the day of infection and every other day after infection leads to an increased survival rate in MHV-infected mice as compared to the control group (Fig. 3A ). In addition, the virus titer assay showed that GA treatment significantly inhibited the viral proliferation in the liver ( Fig. 3B ). As the marker of hepatotoxicity, ALT exhibited a decreasing trend until the level of 530 IU/ml (Fig. 3C) . Furthermore, GA treatment decreased MHV-induced hepatic injury and exhibited fewer necrotic foci upon liver histological analysis (Fig. 3D ). In some sterile hepatic injury diseases, GA attenuates HMGB1-mediated inflammatory by inhibiting TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 production [7, 26, 27] . Pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10 is a predictive marker of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HBV infection [28, 29] . We then determined the gene expression of these four pro-inflammatory cytokines, which have been shown to be key triggers in the innate immune response in hepatic injury in mouse models (Fig. 3E ). Our qPCR data demonstrated that GA treatment during viral infection in mice can suppress the induction of several pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, except IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 3E) , which has some different expression in sterile inflammation disease [26] .",

In order to determine whether GA is able to inhibit the HMGB1-induced expression of inflammatory genes, D2SC cells were co-incubated with HMGB1 solution and different doses of GA for 6 hours. Analysis of the culture supernatants suggested that HMGB1 stimulation leads to the release of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1\uff0cwhich were inhibited by GA treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B-C) . The supernatant solution from infected BNL.CL2 cells was also exposed to UV radiation for virus inactivation and then added to RAW 264.7 cells, after incubating with anti-HMGB1 antibody or GA for 8 hours, qPCR analysis showed that IP-10 expression in macrophages was able to be inhibited by both HMGB1 antibody and GA treatment (Fig. 4D) . TNF-\u03b1 cytokine levels released from RAW 264.7 cells, which was triggered by MHV-infected hepatocyte supernatant, showed the same trend as IP-10 (Fig. 4E ). Similar to our in vivo data, GA treatment in vitro was able to inhibit the induction of IP-10 in MHV-infected BNL.CL2 cells (Fig. 4F) . Therefore, the above results suggested that GA exerts regulation functions in hepatic cells and immune cells. Interestingly, GA and HMB1 antibody treatment did not affect the viral proliferation in BNL.CL2 cell (Fig. 4G) . This was not in accordance with the data from other murine cells. This difference may be due to indirect and immunological viral inhibition mechanisms of GA in hepatic infection model.",

Additionally, IP-10, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 gene were not strongly induced in the TLR4 KO mice infected with MHV, further suggesting that TLR4 is an important immune receptor in mediating inflammation during MHV infection ( Fig. 6E-G) . Although TLR4 KO mice may not affect MHV proliferation in vivo, the TLR4 gene could play a key role in determining the level of HMGB1 release in infected mouse serum, as well as the GA treatment effect (Fig. 6H ).

For example, GA can attenuate LPS-induced fulminant hepatic failure through the deactivation of MAPKs and NF-\u03baB pathway, resulting in the inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 production [42] . GA also inhibits viral proliferation directly and indirectly in vitro and in vivo [30, 43] . Our GA treatment results demonstrated that GA can not only rescue mortality of virus-infected mice and alleviate liver injury, but GA injection can also significantly inhibit viral proliferation in the liver. GL and GA both have been reported to exert antiviral effects, but there is a difference between the antiviral profiles of GL and GA [44, 45] . Although GL exerts antiviral activity in SARS-associated coronavirus infection in vitro, solid evidence of the antiviral activity of GA in the MHV infection animal model is absent [30] . In this study, we first demonstrated the antiviral activity of GA in a murine coronavirus infection model in vivo. To further investigate the mechanism of GA, we performed a cellular assay in vitro and found that it was involved with HMGB1 release and activity. Interestingly, in both hepatic and inflammatory cells, GA treatment or HMGB1 neutralizing antibody treatment significantly inhibited HMGB1 cytokine-inducing activity. Surprisingly, GA did not affect viral proliferation in vitro, which was different from previous reports [30] . This may be because we used mouse embryonic liver cells in our study, whereas previous studies have used Vero cells. The response of mouse embryonic liver cells to MHV infection may differ from Vero cells, and as such, a distinct cellular signaling pathway may be activated in mouse embryonic liver cells in vitro.",

Although GA did not significantly affect TLR4 gene expression during viral infection, expression of TLR4 gene mediated the MHV-induced hepatic inflammation damage and determined HMGB1 release levels in the serum (Fig. 3G and 6H ). In fact, pretreatment with a TLR4 blocking agent decreased the HMGB1 levels from virus-infected cells via the TLR4-NF\u03baB pathway, and the inactivation of NF\u03baB resulted in a decreased release of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and HMGB1 [37, 54] .",

This result was not consistent with HCV and human adenovirus infection, which may due to the different viral pathological and replication mechanism [36, 56, 57] . Acute viral hepatitis caused by MHV is characterized by acute necrosis of hepatocytes, inflammation and production of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-17A [58, 59] . In acute hepatitis B virus infection, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-35 can suppress liver inflammation by reducing IL-17 and IL-22 production, which results in regulating HBV peptides-inducing Th17 cells [60] . In this study, we show for the first time that IL-17A, IL-6, and IL-22 cytokines were released into the serum in response to MHV-A59 infection and are inhibited by GA treatment or TLR4 deficiency. However, there were different variations of IL-10 levels under the two intervening pathways. Although the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 has been shown to have efficacy in reducing inflammatory injury in the liver, its effect on viral titers in some types of hepatitis remains unclear [61] . Based on our MHV infection data, IL-10 was up-regulated by GA treatment or mediated in a TLR4-dependent manner, which might be a new GA regulatory mechanism of cytokine storms resulting from viral infection, excluding the HMGB1-TLR4-IL-17 axis.",
