However, a major rise in the incidence of Gram-positive infections occurred in the mid- to late-1980s such that Gram-positive organisms now cause the majority of invasive bacterial disease in patients with cancer (Fig. 35.1) [3\u201313]. Reasons for the increase in Gram-positive infections include, but are not limited to, antimicrobial prophylaxis strategies, increased use of long-term in-dwelling catheters, and advances in chemotherapeutic regimens [5, 14, 15]. Regardless of the causal factors for the escalation of Gram-positive infections, physicians caring for patients with \u00adcancer need to be familiar with the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of, and the treatment options for, infections due to Gram-positive bacteria. In this chapter, we will examine the major Gram-positive bacterial genera that cause invasive \u00addisease in cancer patients (Table 35.1).\n\n",

S. aureus is a leading cause of catheter-related bacteremia, prosthetic joint infections, and postsurgical infections [21]. Among patients with cancer, suppurative complications such as infective endocarditis, bacteremic pneumonia, and osteomyelitis often result from S. aureus bacteremia [32, 33]. Necrotizing pneumonia due to S. aureus in patients with malignancy usually occurs in mechanically-ventilated patients, but can affect healthy patients in the community especially following an antecedent influenza infection or in patients with long-term in-dwelling catheters (Fig. 35.3) [34, 35]. The rise of CA-MRSA has been especially concerning given that CA-MRSA isolates can cause devastating invasive infection such as necrotizing fasciitis and \u00adnecrotizing pneumonia even in otherwise healthy hosts and more so in patients with cancer [36]. S. aureus is commonly isolated from cancer patients with pyomyositis, septic arthritis, and septic bursitis either as a result of contiguous infection or hematogenous seeding [32].\n",

Good data on the reliability of blood cultures come from studies of CNS catheter-related bacteremia [43]. If a catheter is the source of infection, then quantitative cultures generally show fourfold higher numbers of colony forming units for blood drawn through the catheter compared to peripheral blood [64]. Similarly, \u00adcultures of blood drawn through an affected catheter tends to turn positive in automated blood culture systems at least 2 h earlier compared to those obtained from peripheral blood [64, 70]. The diagnosis of CNS infection from sources other than blood needs to be considered on a patient-specific basis with full knowledge that CNS is both the most common \u00adculture contaminant and a leading cause of prosthetic device infection.",

Because rifampin is active against CNS in the biofilm state, rifampin may be added for serious CNS infections such as prosthetic valve endocarditis although there is no clear proof of its efficacy [68, 74]. CNS are usually susceptible to recently developed antimicrobials such as quinupristin/dalfopristin, linezolid, and daptomycin [60]. With the exceptions of prosthetic valve endocarditis and prosthetic joint infection, most CNS infections respond readily to antimicrobials especially when the infected device is removed [10, 75]. Guidelines suggest that 7 days is adequate treatment for uncomplicated CNS catheter-related bacteremia after catheter removal and relapse rates are generally lower than those observed for S. aureus [43].",

VGS bacteremia occurs almost exclusively in patients receiving aggressive cytoreduction therapy for such conditions as acute leukemia or following bone marrow transplantation [85, 86]. It is believed that the development of mucositis allows for translocation of colonizing VGS from the oropharynx or gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream [87]. VGS bacteremia has been correlated with the use of prophylactic antimicrobials that have limited anti-VGS activity such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones [88].",

The vast majority of infections due to these organisms have a community onset [64]. Having a malignancy markedly increases the risk of invasive disease due to \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci compared to the general population [105, 106]. The risk of cellulitis due to \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci is even further increased in patients with cancer who have had disruption of lymphatic drainage by, for example, a lymph node dissection [107]. Limited systematic studies have suggested that GBS is the most common of the invasive \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci isolated from persons with cancer followed by GAS, GCS, and GGS [108, 109].

Cellulitis due to \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci tends to develop rapidly, spread quickly, and be accompanied by systemic manifestations such as chills and fever [111]. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis caused by \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci in which disease is restricted to the dermis. Lesions are raised above the level of the surrounding tissue, and there is a clear demarcation of involved from uninvolved tissue [112]. This infection tends to occur \u2013 and, importantly \u2013 to recur in areas of damaged lymphatic drainage, which explains the propensity for recurrent infection in the ipsilateral arm after breast resection and lymph node dissection. Among children, GAS along with GCS and GGS are the leading bacterial causes of pharyngitis which is usually uncomplicated, although invasive disease, such as peritonsillar abscess and cervical lymphadentis, may occur [102].",

An exception to this rule is toxic shock syndrome, which can occur in the absence of invasive disease; thus a diagnosis of GAS-related toxic shock syndrome can be supported by isolation of the organism from a mucosal site [116]. Serologic tests are not useful in the acute setting in diagnosing disease due to \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci. Acute and convalescent serum for antibodies to streptolysin O or DNase can be sent to determine whether an infection with GAS has occurred although these tests are rarely used in a clinical setting [117].",

Macrolide and lincosamide resistance rates are highly variable, and these agents should not be used for serious infections without knowing strain susceptibility [120]. Many isolates are resistant to tetracyclines and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [121, 122]. Experience with newer Gram-positive agents such as \u00addaptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and tigecycline is limited although in vitro data are promising [123, 124]. In cases of serious soft tissue infection, especially toxic shock syndrome, clindamycin is added to reduce toxin production by slowly dying GAS [125]. Uncomplicated bacteremia due to \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci can be treated with a 10-day course of antibiotics whereas complicated disease mandates longer therapy. Surgical debridement of devitalized tissue is mandatory when these agents cause necrotizing soft-tissue infections [113].",

In a case of meningitis, inhibition by <0.06 \u03bcg/mL penicillin defines susceptibility; an MIC of \u22650.12 \u03bcg/mL is defined as resistance with about 75% of pneumococcal isolates causing meningitis in the USA being susceptible by these criteria [138]. Pneumococcal isolates are universally susceptible to vancomycin and usually susceptible to quinolones for which there is extensive experience in treating most S. pneumoniae infections, except for meningitis [139]. S. pneumoniae resistance to macrolides, clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and tetracyclines ranges from 20 to 40% in the USA, and these drugs should not be used in treating cancer patients who have invasive pneumococcal disease [140] unless susceptibility has been proven by in vitro testing. There are increasing data indicating that linezolid is effective for S. pneumoniae infections whereas daptomycin is not used to treat pneumonia because it is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant [141]. Although mortality for invasive pneumococcal disease remains around 15% for the first 7 days after admission, most infections respond to relatively short course of antimicrobials with longer courses reserved for meningitis, empyema, and complicated bacteremia [134].",

Vaccination is indicated in all adults \u226565 years of age and at any age for patients with malignancy who have an increased risk of pneumococcal disease such as those with lymphoma, multiple myeloma, transplant recipients, and those receiving chronic glucocorticoids [143]. Unfortunately, it is these very adults who are least likely to respond to such vaccination [144]. In the past decade a protein-conjugated vaccine that includes capsular polysaccharides from seven pneumococcal types has been licensed for use in children. Widespread use of this vaccine in infants and toddlers has reduced the incidence of pneumococcal disease in the entire population; however, replacement by other pneumococcal types has eroded vaccine efficacy in the population at large [129].",

The vast majority of enterococcal infections are nosocomial in origin [146]. The major risk factors for serious enterococcal disease include general debilitation, a prolonged hospital stay, recent surgery, neutropenia, presence of indwelling catheters, and receipt of broad-spectrum antimicrobials [147, 148]. Patients with malignancy appear to have especially high risk for infection with vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) perhaps because of broad use of vancomycin and agents with anti-anaerobic activity in this patient population [147].",

Enterococci are considered to be low virulence pathogens, and enterococcal infections often have a minimal inflammatory component [150]. Fever may or may not be present even in cases of bacteremia [151]. Culture is the mainstay of diagnosis with serologic or antigen tests being of no value. The isolation of enterococci from nonsterile specimens such as urine, sputum, or draining wounds usually represents colonization or subclinical infection rather than infection that requires treatment. Prescribing antibiotics in this situation generally fails to eradicate the organism while promoting the development of antimicrobial resistance and exposing the patient to potentially serious side effects [152]. Even when isolated from sterile sites, such as the abdominal cavity, enterococci are usually present along with one or more other organisms [153], and treatment of more virulent pathogens has been shown to cure such infections even in the absence of targeted enterococcal therapy [151]. This concept is illustrated by the highly effective nature of cephalosporins in treating intra-abdominal infections despite having no anti-enterococcal activity [154].",

Most E. faecalis isolates remain relatively susceptible to penicillins, specifically penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin (not nafcillin) and carbapenems (for example, imipenem), but are intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins [155]. In contrast, penicillin resistance among E. faecium isolates exceeds 50% [155]. Enterococci are generally resistant to macrolides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fluoroquinolones [156]. Vanco-mycin has been the drug of choice for treating enterococci resistant to \u03b2-lactam agents, but rates of VRE have increased dramatically over the past 20 years [152]. Enterococci are \u00adtolerant to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, meaning that they are inhibited but not killed by them; this becomes clinically meaningful in treating endocarditis and, perhaps, infections in neutropenic patients, as well [152]. A bactericidal effect may be achieved against some isolates by the addition of an aminoglycoside. Because, in this instance, the killing is attributable to the aminoglycosides, no synergy occurs against strains that are highly resistant to aminoglycosides, and such resistance has been increasing [157]. The emergence of VRE has left physicians with relatively few treatment options. Linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin are the only drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of infections due to VRE, although both drugs have significant limitations such as a lack of efficacy of quinupristin/dalfopristin against E. faecalis [158]. In vitro data with daptomycin and tigecycline are encouraging although emergence of resistance and reports of clinical failures are concerning [159]. The lack of clear clinical data regarding VRE treatment has recently led the Infectious Diseases Society of America to declare that determining optimal VRE treatment strategies is an area of paramount importance [160].",

            "text": "For many years empiric antimicrobial treatment of cancer patients with possible bacterial infections focused on Gram-negative pathogens, because bacteremic infection with these organisms was associated with a high risk of death [75]. The increased rates of isolation of Gram-positive pathogens has led many physicians to add an anti-Gram-positive antimicrobial, such as vancomycin or linezolid, when treating cancer patients with suspected infection [161], even though the same risk for death has not been documented for Gram-positive compared with Gram-negative bacteremia [66, 162]. In fact, clinical trials demonstrate no clinical benefit for the addition of targeted anti-Gram positive antimicrobials in empiric treatment regimens [94, 163, 164]. Widespread use of vancomycin and other targeted anti-Gram-positive agents is a major factor contributing to the emergence of such multi-drug resistant organisms as VRE [165]. Nonetheless, the practice of adding vancomycin or other targeted Gram-positive antimicrobials empirically in neutropenic patients with fever and, by extension, in many other cancer patients who are not neutropenic, remains pervasive [166]. Taken together, these factors have led to specific recommendations against adding empiric anti-Gram-positive treatment in patients with cancer and suspected infection [94]. Institutional attempts to limit additional empiric anti-Gram-positive antimicrobial treatment to patients with specific risk factors have had limited success to date, but provide some hope for minimizing the overuse of antimicrobial agents [4]. Historically, a broad array of Gram-positive pathogens have shown the remarkable ability to overcome any widely prescribed antimicrobial, and thus antimicrobial conservation may play a pivotal role in the long-term control of these prevalent organisms [167].",
