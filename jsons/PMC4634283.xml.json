Symptoms include fever, cough, rhinorrhea, and LRT illness such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis.1, 2 Influenza C virus has been shown to be a significant cause of URT illness in children less than 6 years old, and the risk of complications with LRT illness is particularly high in children less than 2 years old,2, 3 resulting in more severe illness and hospitalization.4, 5 In adult volunteer studies, the disease caused by influenza C can vary from an asymptomatic to a mild upper respiratory tract infection.6 A case of acute encephalopathy associated with influenza C has also been reported.7 Influenza C virus has been documented as the etiological cause of several outbreaks in schools and the community8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13; hence, its role in adding to the overall burden of respiratory illness should not be underestimated. High rates of seroprevalence have been reported for influenza C, suggesting that the virus is circulating widely in the population.1, 14, 15, 16\n",

This will allow us to understand the burden of influenza C infections in the community both as single and mixed infections with other respiratory viruses. Mixed infections in children are not uncommon, with various studies showing that coinfection rates range from 5 to 65%,32 and have a higher likelihood of being admitted to a pediatric ICU.33 The participating role of influenza C as a sole or mixed infection in this vulnerable patient category deserves further study.",

Given the relative frequency of influenza C from studies in the literature, it is likely that some of these infections could be caused by this virus; presently the proportion is unknown. Recent studies32 show that human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus in this group of patients have a significantly higher rate of mortality, and defining the frequency and outcome of influenza C infections in this group of patients is worthy of study.",

This suggests that epidemiologically dominant variants of influenza C viruses do not emerge successively.37\n",
