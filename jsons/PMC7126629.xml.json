For years, Streptococcus pneumoniae has been invariably found the most common etiologic factor of CAP [2]. The introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) had an important impact on both the incidence of CAP and its complication rate. The incidence of CAP has been reported to decline in some well developed countries, where PCV had been widely introduced, but at the same time, an increasing incidence of local complications was noted. Data from the United States collected between 1996 and 2007 showed that all-cause pneumonia hospitalization rate in children younger than 2 years decreased by 33%, and the number of children hospitalized due to community acquired pneumococcal pneumonia decreased even by 61%. However, this decline was associated with 2-fold increase of empyema. This phenomenon may have an important impact on the overall efficacy of CAP treatment [3].",

Since the results of individual microbiological studies are usually not available at the time of decision making on antibiotic therapy and the positive results of these studies can be expected in only minority of patients [5], [6], [9], the choice of antibiotics is based on local microbiological data and the results of epidemiological studies. In this context, studies on etiology of PPE and PE have an enormous impact on proper antibiotic treatment in children with local complications of CAP. It has been shown that molecular techniques are significantly more sensitive than standard microbiological cultures. Their use may be associated with even several fold increase in the detection rate of S. pneumoniae and other bacteria [5], [6], [10].",

To our knowledge no such data have been published for Poland. This issue seems to be particularly important in terms of increasing proportion of Polish children receiving PCV. Thus, we undertook a study aimed at the evaluation of the etiology of PPE/PE in children managed in the referral pulmonary center in Poland. The secondary goals of the study were: 1) comparison of the diagnostic yield of standard culture with molecular techniques in the determination of PPE/PE etiology in children, 2) comparison of microorganisms responsible for local complications of CAP in children vaccinated vs. non-vaccinated with PCV.",

It could have been expected that the introduction of PCV would decrease the proportion of children with pneumococcal pleural infections in favor of other pathogens, e.g. S. pyogenes and S. aureus. Data on such phenomenon are rather equivocal. Indeed, in some countries an increase in the proportion of staphylococcal pleural infections has been observed [3], [18], [19]. In the United States, empyema caused by S. aureus in children less than 2 years old increased 4 - fold between 1996\u20131998 and 2005\u20132007 [3]. On the other hand, in a Canadian study by Pernica et al. performed between January 2009 and March 2011 not even a single case of staphylococcal infection was found [5]. At this time all children in Canada were routinely vaccinated against pneumococcal infections. Thus, although we were surprised not to identify any patient with PPE/PE caused by S. aureus, our results are in agreement with the above mentioned results of the Canadian study. In both these studies, the two most common pathogens responsible for pleural infections were S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. However, significantly fewer patients with unknown cause of PPE/PE were reported in the study by Pernica et al. than in our study. S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes were responsible for 62% and 16% of all pleural infections in Canada and for 41% and 5% in Poland, respectively.",

            "text": "Another interesting issue is the changing role of different pneumococcal serotypes in children pleural infections related to PCV introduction. A shift between the serotypes causing PPE/PE has been observed after vaccination with PCV7 [20]. The predominant serotypes responsible for pleural infections in countries where PCV vaccination is common are serotypes 1 and 19A. Serotype 1 infections have been frequently reported in Spain and Turkey [10], [21]. In contrast, in our study S. pneumoniae serotype 1 was detected in only one pleural fluid sample. The second most common serotype responsible for the replacement phenomenon observed after introduction of PCV7 is serotype 19A [6], [22]. Our study showed that, contrary to serotype 1, serotype 19A is also a significant problem in country, where the percentage of vaccinated children is low. This serotype was the second most common serotype in our study - 6/26 (23%). Four children infected with serotype 19A were either not vaccinated or received PCV7, while 2 were vaccinated with PCV13. Both of these children were vaccinated in the third year of life (1 dose). As the immunogenity after a single dose vaccination with serotype 19A has not been reported to be impaired (as was with serotype 3), the serious infections with 19A serotype seem to be somewhat surprising [23]. The most common serogroup in our study, responsible for 40% of all infections was serogroup 6. This could have been expected, as only approximately 20% of our patients received PCV. Of 11 children infected with serogroup 6 (serotype 6A in 2 cases and serotype 6B 9 cases), two had earlier received PCV10. Despite that, these two children had PPE/PE caused by serotype 6B S. pneumoniae, which is covered by PCV10. In contrast to our observation, the studies performed in other countries where the percentage of vaccinated children in the study groups was relatively low (less than 50%) the infections with serogroup 6 were rather rare [10], [21]. Serotype 3 was the third most common serotype found in our study. All cases occurred in non-immunized children: 2 not vaccinated and 1vaccinated with PCV10, while serotype 3 is covered only by PCV13. However, alarming reports on serotype 3 PPE/PE occurring in children after PCV 13 have been published recently [24], [25].",

Similarly to other studies, H. influenzae was not found to be present in pleural infections [5], [6], [10]. This may be a consequence of the widespread use of H. influenzae type b vaccine. S. maltophila was detected in blood sample of one patient. However, according to previous studies the role of this organism in pulmonary infection is unclear. There are opinions that S maltophila is contaminant rather than a true pathogen, particularly in immunocompetent patients [28]. On the other hand, there are studies showing that S. maltophila is an important etiologic factor of PPE/PE in immunocompromised adults. Surgery or chest tube drainage as well as broncho-pleural and esophageal-pleural fistulas seem to be risk factors for empyema caused by this pathogen [28]. The similar concerns - true pathogen or contamination \u2013 refer to coagulase-negative staphylococci (Staphylococcus hominis identified in blood cultures of two children in our study).",

Noteworthy is that in none of our patients M. pneumoniae was isolated as single pathogen (2 pleural fluid samples were also positive for C. pneumoniae and one for S. pneumoniae). There are few studies aimed to detect C. pneumoniae in children with PPE/PE. In a study by Strachan et al., C. pneumoniae was found in one specimen of pleural fluid (1/145\u20130.7%) and was accompanied by S. pneumoniae\n[6]. In our study group, DNA of C. pneumoniae was found in 5 pleural fluid samples. Two of these samples were also positive for M. pneumoniae but in 3 patients C. pneumoniae was the only pathogen. In fact, C. pneumoniae was the second most common bacteria found in our patients with pleural infections.",

In our study group, adenovirus was the most common viral agent detected in pleural fluid. This seems to be consistent with data cited by the BTS guidelines [30]. Interestingly, in four of our patients, adenoviruses accompanied pleural infection caused by S. pneumoniae. An increased incidence of PPE/PE during influenza virus pandemic was observed in different parts of the world [10], [31], [32]. In southern Spain, 36% of children with pleural empyema admitted to the hospital during influenza A virus (H1N1) pandemic had influenza co-infection. Single cases of empyema caused by other viruses were also reported, e.g. cytomegalovirus in an immunocompromised child [33]. Recently Games et al. published a study aimed to establish the potential role of torque teno mini viruses (TTMV) in the pathogenesis of parapneumonic empyema in children. The authors showed that TTMV can deeply colonize lungs and are able to modulate the innate immune response of pulmonary cells by inducing the production of inflammatory mediators [34].",

Second, as the microbiological data on the etiology of PPE/PE come from one referral children hospital where mainly patients from Warsaw or surrounding area are treated, they may not ideally reflect epidemiological situation in other regions.
