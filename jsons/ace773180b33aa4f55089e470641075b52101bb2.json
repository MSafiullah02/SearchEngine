This report presents analysis of foliage nutrient concentrations in species within these groupings. The highest concentrations of phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and potassium occurred in the suburban/disturbed group. The lowest overall concentrations were found in foliage from species in the dry sclerophyll communities. Mean foliage phosphorus was 0.099%, 0.125% and 0.042% for wet sclerophyll, disturbed and dry sclerophyll groups, respectively. Exotic species, particularly in disturbed environments, had the highest foliage nutrient concentrations. Results presented here showed that foliage nutrient concentrations are consistent with definitions of these groups on the basis of total soil phosphorus. These changes are considered to be important for management and conservation of bushland areas around Sydney.",

Bushland sites in the northem suburbs of Sydney were compared with relatively unaffected areas in the Brisbane Waters, Ku-ring-gai Chase and Royal National Parks. Higher phosphorus levels were detected in soils of suburban sites compared with those from similar parent materials in non-suburban areas. The analysis of vegetation revealed three major clusters of species, based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering. The major species clusters were: (1) elements associated with wet sclerophyll or rainforest margins; (2) those related to the activities of man; and (3) species associated with dry sclerophyll forests and heaths. The first main cluster was considered to be related to nutrient-rich soils, the third cluster was related to nutrient-poor soils, whereas the presence of the second cluster was restricted to suburban sites. Clements (1983) concluded that a major effect of suburban development on bushland is to increase soil total phosphorus levels, thereby decreasing the abundance of species that occur naturally on low nutrient soils, and increasing the abundance of species adapted to high nutrient soils.",

These were not taken from the same sites as Clements (1983) but from similar general geographical areas. There were fewer than five samples for most species and so a mean is reported for each species without error terms. The information is presented to give a basis for testing the hypothesis of a relationship between suburban disturbance and soil nutritional status and, hence, plant nutritional status. This becomes of critical importance for both the maintenance of existing vegetation or the amelioration of damaged sites. Non-parametric testing of between species groups (Sokal & Rohlf 1969) was carried out, specifically the Mann-Whitney tests.",

However, it would appear to not be a phosphorus effect alone. While many of the soils derived from Hawkesbury sandstone have very low phosphorus concentrations, they are also low in other elements important for plant nutrition, and the suburban environment has also either enriched and/or increased the availability of these elements. For example, foliage calcium was 0,39%, 0.50% and 1,46% for the dry sclerophyll, wet sclerophyll and disturbed sites, respectively, the last figure being significantly higher than the other two. Potassium was 0.62%, 0,95% and 1.70%, respectively, for the same sites, this difference also being significant. That is, species on disturbed sites have a higher uptake of both calcium and potassium. Aluminium, which may be expected to be more available on disturbed sites, is slightly higher in foliage from Group 1 and appears to be closely related to genera, such as the aluminium-accumulating genus Ceratopetalum (Webb 1954; Turner & Kelly 1981) , No significant effects were found for chloride concentration.",

However, foliage from Grevillea robusta and Phytalacca octandra are considerably higher in nutrients and relate to species from disturbed sites which were similar to those from which they were sampled, A major problem with both soil and foliage nutrient concentration data when attempting to compare sites and species is that actual availabilities or requirements for nutrients are not known. Thus, an undisturbed and a disturbed site may both have similar soil total phosphorus but disturbance (physical disturbance or change in drainage due to building construction further upslope) would alter organic matter decomposition and hence phosphorus availability. Further, a slowgrowing plant with high phosphorus requirements may take up from the soil the same quantity of phosphorus as a faster-growing plant with low phosphorus requirements. Although only relative indices of nutrient uptake or requirement were measured, it appears that disturbance leads to changed nutritional conditions allowing weeds with higher nutrient requirements to become established.",
