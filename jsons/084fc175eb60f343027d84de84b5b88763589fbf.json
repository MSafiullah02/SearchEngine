In recent years, a summary of visitor statistics reveals that the region welcomed approximately 528,000 international and domestic visitors annually, with visitor spending totalling approximately C$388 million: the figure for Yukon was 314,450 (Belik 2013); for Nunavut it was 30,525 (Belik 2013); for North West Territory 64,380 (Belik 2013); for Churchill (Manitoba): 20,747 (City of Thompson, Manitoba 2012); for Nunavik 88,000 (Tourism Quebec 2010) ; and for Labrador 10,394 (Government of Newfoundland and Labrador 2011). Spending was as follows: Yukon C$200 million, Nunavut C$40 million, North West Territory C$99.5 million, Manitoba C$21 million, Nunavik C$18 million, Labrador C$9.9 million. The Yukon is Canada's most visited Arctic destination because it has relatively easy road access from the USA via Alaska.",

            "text": "The Arctic is defined as Canada north of 60\u00b0 N, as can be seen in Fig. 6 .1, together with northern Quebec (Nunavik) and Labrador (Nunatsiavut), but, as Johnston (1995) points out, definitions of the Arctic can also be culturally (based on indigenous, aboriginal populations) and historically based constructs, and with changes in climate the definition will vary in the future. The definition probably, though, should be based on climate, permafrost and biogeography, and on this basis there can be a useful subdivision into the High Arctic and Sub-Arctic Canada. The High Arctic includes all the islands and archipela-gos north of the continental mass, most of which are uninhabited, but there are thinly scattered Inuit settlements in small coastal villages for the most part, mainly on the southern islands, and very few towns, except on the bigger islands, such as Baffin Island (Fig. 6 .2). The landscape is dominated by glaciers and small ice caps which are in general retreat as a result of climate change; it is treeless, with tundra vegetation; there is permafrost and a periglacial landscape outside the glaciated areas with landforms like pingos, patterned ground and ice wedges; and the climate is cold, with average temperatures in January between 0 \u00b0C and \u221234 \u00b0C and in July between 10 \u00b0C and \u221210 \u00b0C and a short summer season of less than three months. The archipelagos are bounded to the west by the Beaufort Sea, on the north-west by the Arctic Ocean and on the east by Greenland, Baffin Bay and Davis Strait, and the Canadian Arctic stretches over a vast area-8000 km from west to east. To the south are Hudson Bay and the Canadian mainland. The archipelago consists of over 36,000 islands, the largest being Baffin Island, followed by Victoria Island, Ellesmere Island ( Fig. 6. 3), Banks Island, Devon Island, Axel Heiberg Island and Somerset Island. After Greenland it is the world's largest High Arctic area and has 39% of Canada's total land area but less than 1% of its population. It is sometimes called the Far North and divided into the Eastern Arctic with Nunavut and Nunavik, which is an autonomous part of Quebec province and Nunatsiavut, an autonomous part of Newfoundland province and Labrador. The Western Arctic is the north-west portion of the North West Territory and a small part of the Yukon, together called the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. The Sub-Arctic to the south of the High Arctic, with temperatures above 10\u00b0 C for between one and three months, is composed mainly of boreal, coniferous forest, has First Nation Tribes and reserves and around 15% of the Canadian population.

            "text": "Tourism is regarded as a relatively benign economic development alternative compared with that of energy and mineral exploration in the polar regions (Hall and Saarinen 2010a) . The Canadian government has favoured the latter but with relatively little success. Tourism is also potential evidence for laying claim to polar territory as a form of economic use and is therefore part of the broader Canadian national polar geopolitical strategy. Hence the role of tourism has increased and tourism development is seen as a highly beneficial activity with the capacity to contribute to the wider socio-economic development of polar regions (Snyder 2007; Hall and Saarinen 2010b) and particularly in the Canadian Arctic (Robbins 2007) . However, in the Canadian Arctic region tourism also benefits from energy and mineral exploration as the infrastructure required for oil, gas and other mineral development with respect to transport connectivity and accommodation is the same infra-structure that is also used by commercial tourism (Government of the Northwest Territories Industry, Tourism and Investment 2009) . However, despite large investment in oil and mineral exploration, the returns have been relatively modest, and the producing mines, for example, in the North West Territory (NWT) there are three diamond mines (Diavik, Ekati and Snap Lake) employing 3300 people in total, whilst the tungsten mine at Canting employs only 204 (NWT Mineral Development Strategy, Government of NWT 2014). Nevertheless the NWT Geological Survey Strategic Plan 2017-2022 (2017) seems much more optimistic.",

This was because of a combination of the 9/11 incident and the intense border security, the SARS outbreak of 2002, the global recession of 2008 and the recent unattractive exchange rates. However, recently there has been an increase, mainly owing to Chinese and other Asian tourists. The number of international tourist trips for 2017 for the Arctic regions, though, is extremely small, with the Yukon Territory having 1.63 million visits and Nunavut only 170,000, especially when compared with Ontario (9.77 million visits), British Columbia (5.7 million) and Quebec (3.14 million) . It ought to be comparable with Greenland, which has extensively marketed the adventure tourism industry, and been successful, but this does not appear to be the case for Arctic Canada. Partly this is due to the inaccessibility of much of the region, the extremely high costs of internal flights and the high costs of accommodation too. Unlike from Greenland, there are no direct flights to the USA or Europe.",

            "text": "Tourism in the North West Territory (NWT) has shown marginal annual increases since 2000 but represent only the third-largest export, behind mining and petroleum products (Government of NWT 2014). In 2007/2008, it is estimated that 79,000 tourists and business travellers spent C$138 million on NWT goods and services, of which just over C$60 million is attributable to the accommodation and food services sector (Government of the North West Territory Industry, Tourism and Investment (GNWTITI) 2009) . Contributing more to the economy than the combined sales of agriculture, forestry, fishing and trapping, tourism is the largest renewable resource industry (GNWTITI 2009 ). By 2016-2017 tourist figures were at a record 93,910, although 20,000 of these were business travellers, who nevertheless took part in tourist activities. The growth of tourism and a breakdown of the reasons for visiting into six market sectors over a twelve-year period is shown in Table 6 .1. NWT Tourism markets the area as a Spectacular World Class Tourist Destination, and this can be seen from Fig. 6 .4A, B. These figures show a growth since 2012 owing to a combination of factors, including the weak Canadian dollar and low gas prices, which provide a strong incentive for Canadians to vacation domestically and at the same time has attracted more visitors from overseas. Canada's reputation as a safe destination compared with some parts of the world must also have helped the growth. For example, between 2013-2014 and 2016-2017 tourists from China grew from 180 to 6200, with an annual growth rate of 55% during that period. This is likely to continue, especially as representatives from the NWT's tourism industry travelled to China in June 2018 with the goal of placing the NWT at the top of the minds of visitors from the industry's largest international market. The growth areas indicate a general increase in tourism along with outdoor adventure of 35% over the previous ten years from [2006] [2007] [2008] [2009] [2010] [2011] [2012] [2013] [2014] [2015] [2016] , aurora viewing increased spectacularly by 23% since 2016/2017, whilst fishing and hunting declined. However, the growth has caused problems with tourist infra- structure and there has been a hotel room shortage in Yellowknife on occasions. Nevertheless, despite this growth, national park visiting has remained low, as can be seen from Table 6 .2, which may in part be due to budget cuts to Parks Canada, but is more likely to be due to the extreme inaccessibility, especially of Aulavik on northern Banks Island and Tuktut Nogait, where the main access is by charter aircraft from Paulatuk. All the parks have spectacular landscapes, including mountains, lakes ( Fig. 6 .4A) and rivers, ideal for paddling, hiking and climbing in Nahanni ( Figure 6 .4B), and magnificent wildlife. For example, Aulavik has two-thirds (over 10,000) of the world's musk oxen (Fig. 6 .5), Tuktut Nogait has the 68,000 Bluenose caribou herd and Wood Buffalo has wood bison, wolves and black bears. The Wood Buffalo Park has year-round road access from Fort Smith, which is reflected in the visitor numbers. The newest national park was created in 2014, the N\u00e1\u00e1ts'ihch'oh, which is 5000 sq. km of Alpine scenery, with excellent paddling on the Natla, Keele, Broken Skull and headwaters of the Nahanni rivers.",

The polar bears are the world's largest terrestrial carnivores and are among the most carefully managed species (Fikkan et al. 1993) in the northern hemisphere. Between 500 and 650 polar bears are hunted annually in Canada (see Table 6 .5), far more than are hunted in Greenland or Alaska, whereas Norway and Russia, the other nations with significant polar bear populations, have banned all forms of polar bear hunting owing to non-sustainable uses of bear populations such as trophyhunting. The majority of the harvest in Canada is taken by the Inuit of Nunavut. For Nunavummiut (regional Inuit people), polar bear meat remains an important item in their diet and, with the advent of a fur trade with non-Inuit in the early twentieth century, polar bear hides became an economic resource; the sale of the skins is still a part of the contemporary economy. Under the multilateral Agreement for the Conservation of Polar Bear, Canada has a legal and scientifically managed polar bear hunt (Lentfer 1974) . Inuit are permitted to sell bears from their annual quota to non-aboriginal recreational hunters. Typically, each year Nunavummiut make between seventyfive and ninety bears available to recreational hunters from the USA, western Europe, Japan and Latin America. With the average cost of a recreational polar bear hunt now between C$35,000 and C$60,000, this trophy-hunting is now at least as important in economic terms as the traditional polar bear fur trade. Polar bear trophy-hunting may be one of the most taxing hunts anywhere in terms of the toll it exacts on hunters and their equipment. Conducted mainly between March, when temperatures average \u221225 \u00b0C, and the end of May, when it may be as warm as +5 \u00b0C, client hunters travel across the sea ice with an Inuit guide and his hunt assistant on hunts lasting up to ten days, often covering 300-500 km during a trip. By regulation, trophy-hunting must be done using traditional means, which is by dog team, and the conditions are frequently extreme and taxing for recreational hunters. The most obvious benefit Inuit derive from recreational polar bear hunting is the financial contribution to the communities that host and stage trophy hunts (for example, Foote and Wenzel 2008 Tyrrell 2009 ). Such benefits most obviously accrue to the individuals who work as guides or are otherwise involved in trophy-hunting, such as the assistants, but there are also other returns-some economic and others less apparent-that transcend wages to individual Inuit. A polar bear trophy hunt is expensive, with the cost paid by client-hunters to the southern expediters (for example, Canada North Outfitting, who have their head office in Edmonton, Alberta, www.canadanorthoutfitting. com/) that are the link between the sport hunt community and the Inuit in Nunavut. In fact, the portion of the money that ultimately enters northern communities ranges from around 43% (at Taloyoak) to about 60% (at Resolute Bay) of the price paid to wholesalers, according to Foote and Wenzel (2008) . Even though a substantial proportion of the fee paid by a visitor hunter goes to a southern expediter, hosting polar bear trophyhunting offers distinct economic benefit to northern communities and to the Inuit who participate in it as community outfitters, guides and hunt assistants (see Table 6 .4). This economic benefit, however, is disputed by the Humane Society of the USA (2013). Nevertheless, Dowsley (2009a, b) suggests that each recreational hunt provides about twenty times the monetary value of a polar bear taken in a subsistence hunt.",

The benefits to the recreational hunter, as Wenzel and Bourgouin (2003) note, is that, after the rarity of polar bear trophies, it is the experience of traveling and living with Inuit upon which those who have hunted in Nunavut most frequently comment. Traditional skills are not only still a part of modern Inuit life but are essential to it. Moreover, many come away realising that the role of tradition among Inuit is not limited to the pursuit of a bear or a level of comfort with the environment, but is also a matter of the closeness that exists among Inuit and between them and the Arctic. There are other positive cultural outcomes for communities that offer recreational hunts, and these include the revival of dog-mushing, the preservation of traditional sewing and the preservation of hunting and survival skills (Dowsley 2009a, b) .",

Examples of restrictions included: no killing bears in dens, no killing sows with cubs and designation of certain refuge areas. However, great flexibility was allowed for Inuit to take and participate in sponsoring trophy-hunting for polar bears by foreign hunters. Even though some people remain opposed to the killing of bears for any reason, not much widespread organised opposition to polar bear hunting has been mounted on a moral basis so far. The polar bear harvest is moderate annually worldwide, and the hunt is virtually impossible to observe by opponents of hunting or by the media. Polar bear tag allotments are issued to Inuit hunters, who have been harvesting bears annually for over 4000 years, there is a strong record of sustainable use and, consequently, it is difficult for opposition groups to make claims that limited hunting is a major extinction threat to polar bears.",

            "text": "It is important to recall that polar bear tag allocation is through the hunter/trapper organisations and that Inuit hunters decide how many bears from their annual regional allotments will be harvested by native hunters and how many will be allocated for sale to foreign recreational hunters: often around 15%, but with variations by community. Most recreational hunters are from the USA, followed by substantial numbers from central European countries. Under this quota system, the same numbers of bears will be killed even if recreational hunting were reduced or eliminated. The highly desirable recreational hunting tags would simply be used by Inuit hunters for subsistence hunting to provide meat, recreational opportunities and furs for crafts. The quotas are determined by biologists, Inuit traditional ecological knowledge and with prudent oversight and recommendations from the Polar Bear Technical Working Group. Based on the 2004-2005 observations of Inuit hunters seeing higher numbers of polar bears, the Nunavut territorial government increased its annual hunting quotas by 29% to 518 tags, an increase of 115 bears, despite the concern of biologists that this was too many tags. However as the Inuit value the bears so highly and seek conservative harvests, there is substantial compromise and adjustment with input from authorities, and in this case a scaling back did occur after this season. There is often disagreement about whether polar bears are increasing or decreasing in numbers between the scientists, who suggest that because of climatic change the numbers are decreasing, and the Inuit, who see more bears around their communities and think that the bears are increasing in number (Tyrrell 2006) . However, pressure to reduce hunting for reasons not supported by evidence could result in an undue reduction in the value of polar bear harvesting, which may result in a loss of local support for conservation measures, including polar bear quotas, which would erode rather than support the protection of the polar bear as a species (Dowsley 2009a, b) . Foote and Wenzel (2008) suggest there are three-way reciprocal benefits: hunters reap profound emotional and experiential benefits; hosting communities find value, both tangible and intangible, in the process of supporting hunting for species such as polar bear; and ecosystem robustness and sustainability are usually enhanced by increased value, resulting in higher conservation priority given to the habitats of hunted species. Importantly, these species, such as the polar bear, are accorded great intrinsic value and afforded protection resulting from conservation concepts being incorporated into carefully regulated hunting protocols. The hunting affects the way people value wildlife and wildlife habitat. Consequently, it can contribute to sus-tainability of hunted wildlife populations and their habitat by providing the incentive for local people living in close contact with wildlife species to become their stewards, as the Inuit have always been for the last 4000 years.",

In 2015 a CITES committee meeting in Tel Aviv determined that the international trade in polar bear is not detrimental to the survival of the species and the USA dropped a bid to ban the international trade in polar bear products.

The usual attempts to beat the Safari Club International Trophy Records, the annual World Hunting Awards, which recognises all hunters who have achieved exceptional levels of big game hunting, and the Pope and Young Record Book, which claims to be one of North America's leading bow-hunting and conservation organisations, do not help here. Some biologists have suggested that polar bears are inherently unsuitable as a target for recreational hunting as the population relies on high adult survival, has a low birth rate, high cub mortality, inhabits a marginal environment and is extremely vulnerable to the effects of habitat degradation and loss triggered by climate change, shipping developments and pollution as it is the top predator in the food chain.

Problematically, there is little about polar bear viewing tours that reflect the living conditions of indigenous people, or the relationship they have with polar bears. Tour operators recognise and respond to their clients' demand for comfort, safety and gourmet meals. Luxury accommodation set in one of the harshest climates on earth holds a curious attraction for foreign visitors. Most tourism companies in Churchill (Manitoba), where a lot of the polar bear viewing takes place, work to minimise their ecological impacts and to avoid wildlife disturbance, yet perverse incentives exist to accommodate visitor desires, sometimes to the detriment of the resource. Isaacs (2000) observes that 'The rigors of a market system that caters to the resource-intensive preferences of modern con-sumers will make it difficult for low-impact ecotourism operators to prosper.' Amongst the advertisements for polar-bear-watching ecotourism, there seems no evidence or suggestion that any of the polar bear viewing ecotourism companies are Inuit-owned, and because almost all tourist needs are met by non-Inuit ecotour companies, the local people are likely to receive a reduced share of profits flowing from bear viewers. The provision of financial benefits to local indigenous people should be one of the primary criteria defining ecotourism. Bear viewing may be more accurately characterised as simply tourism, though, because there are no accepted standards or certifying organisations, the term 'ecotour' will probably continue to be used in advertising this activity.",

The first company started tours in 1974, with other companies following in the early 1980s (Webb 1985) . The Gordon Point area, which is predominantly used for polar bear viewing, is located along the westcentral part of the point during the ice-free period (July to November), when the bears are forced to come ashore (Stirling et al. 1977) . While ashore, bears conserve energy and are sustained by their stored fat reserves. Tour operators have been transporting visitors into areas where bears congregate, using large customised vehicles that travel across tundra. Human-TV-polar bear interactions have been observed in these staging areas, resulting in some instances of food conditioning (where food is given to bears so that they get used to this and are conditioned), habituation and harassment (Watts and Ratson 1989; Herrero and Herrero 1997) . Some of these interactions may elicit behavioural and physiological responses that could compromise the bears' energy balance (Knight and Gutzwiller 1995) . TV activity may impose an energetic cost on bears, depriving them of energy that could otherwise be utilised for growth, maintenance, reproduction and lactation, or for different activities such as male play-fighting (Dyck 2001) . Polar bears are easily affected by hyperthermia, and so reduction of unnecessary movement may be important for the conservation of energy. The rate of depletion of energy reserves will influence an animal's condition when it returns to the sea ice and may affect reproductive success, or even subsequent survival. Churchill is unique in that bears are viewed at close distances relative to any other bear-viewing location. The close proximity of TVs and polar bears in the Gordon Point area at Churchill poses a question vital to the bear management and the nature tourism industry: do human activities at Churchill induce behavioural changes in polar bears? In addition to viewing bears from TVs, two stationary tundra train lodges provide accommodation and viewing options. The vehicles are large, with the base of the viewing windows reaching approximately 3.5 m off the ground, and the lodges are modifications of these vehicles, with seven vehicles linked together making a combined length of approximately 60 m.",

            "text": "TVs use a trail system consisting of established trails, eskers and foreshore flats to transport visitors into the Gordon Point area. While most visitors engage in bear-viewing activities from TVs, many take advantage of helicopter rides. These flights usually begin in July and last as long as bears are in the area. Half-hour and hour-long tours are flown along the shoreline, over spits, Fox Island and toward Cape Churchill. Most of these activities take place in the Churchill Wildlife Management Area and are thus overseen by Manitoba Conservation. Permits are issued for TVs, train lodges and helicopter activities and also include a provision for vehicles to drive on established trails. However, no special training or ecological educational background is required to operate TVs. Manitoba Conservation set certain spits and islands aside as Designated Polar Bear Resting areas to provide undisturbed resting opportunities for polar bears awaiting the freezeup of Hudson Bay. The primary polar bear viewing season at Churchill lasts only forty-two to fifty days on average, but it is the number of tourists involved and the types of interactions with the bears that cause the problems. In 2000 an estimate of 9720 tourists was made by Dyck (2001) , but on the basis of information provided by him this was a gross underestimate and CBS News in 2004 suggested that there were 15,000 tourists travelling to Churchill, although some visit for other reasons, such as to see beluga whales. The mean approach distance between bears and vehicles was estimated by Dyck (2001) to be 24.3 m. The observed average number of TVs around a bear was 2.1 +/\u2212 0.1 TV, ranging from one to nine TVs. The minimum time TVs were within 20-30 m of a bear was estimated to be three hours. Family groups (5.5 +/\u2212 1.2 TVs) and sub-adult males (4.6 +/\u2212 1.2) had more TVs around them than bears of other sex and age classes. Disturbances in the form of approaching and leaving TVs around a bear occurred every 10.2 +/\u2212 1.7 minutes. Vigilance behaviour in the presence of TV activity was significantly increased, with increased frequencies of head-ups, and decreased time intervals between vigilance bouts (Dyck and Baydack 2004) . Overall, bears were 2.5 times more vigilant in the presence of TVs than without. Qualitative information was recorded by Dyck (2001) on tourist behaviour, helicopter and TV activity during polar bear viewing. On several occasions, passengers on TVs were observed photographing polar bears from the roofs of vehicles. Film crews and regular passengers were observed disembarking from TVs for unknown purposes, but it is assumed for better photo opportunities of specific objects of interest, likely to be bears.",

Attempts to get the attention of polar bears included whistling and loud talking by passengers, and the starting of the engine by TV drivers.

However, Eckhardt (2005) stated that bears that responded to vehicle approach did so at an average of 43 m, and this was closer than 50 m, which is often suggested as a possible buffer zone distance and is the distance between wildlife and tourists recommended to minimise response. This is a much greater distance than that suggested by Dyck (2001) . This greater distance from bears to tourist vehicles could minimise responses to vehicles and reduce behavioural responses in the number of bears in response to vehicle approach.",

Hence, management actions (for example, education for tourists and tour operators, policies) should be designed that manage human activity in this area. Cooperation among all parties (for example, Manitoba Conservation, Manitoba Department of Culture, Heritage and Tourism, tour operators, Parks Canada) is necessary to accomplish this goal. In the year 2016-2017 there was a reduction in tourism to Churchill because the rail connection with Winnipeg had been broken and there had been an impasse over who would pay for the repairs. Up to this event there had been approximately 12,000 tourists in the six-week polar bear viewing period, but poor communications, with no roads, expensive air fares and infrequent rail services, has always been a problem for tourism in Churchill.",

Simply because there may be some costs to the bears does not mean bear-watching is not a worthwhile activity.

This problem has now been reduced since the town rubbish dump has been closed since 2005. Recently, Inuit and Cree communities have reported increases in polar bear-human interactions and conflicts around Baffin Bay and Hudson Bay, as well as bears being more aggressive and less afraid of people (Dowsley and Wenzel 2009; Nirlungayuk and Lee 2009; Tyrrell 2009; Lemelin et al. 2010) .

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) list the numbers of musk oxen at around 121,000 in Canada, but in the Arctic archipelago these are declining as a result of lungworm which is a parasite, because of a bacteria, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae and/or because of a virus related to a similar one in domestic sheep and goats. It also appears that climate change may be making them more susceptible to illness (Bennett 2017) . Kutz et al.

            "text": "Giardia was found in seventy samples of musk ox faeces. As musk oxen were extremely rare on the island in the early twentieth century, the present infection is likely to result from recent, and perhaps ongoing, introduction(s) of Giardia associated with contemporary settlement and/or tourism. The high prevalence and intensity of Giardia observed in musk oxen in this study are unprecedented among wild ungulates and suggest that musk oxen are important hosts on Banks Island. Several characteristics of musk oxen and Giardia may support parasite maintenance. Musk oxen are highly susceptible and competent hosts for pathogens from many species. They are relatively sedentary herd animals that congregate in river valleys for feeding, a behavioural trait that contributes to large numbers of cysts in a moist environment and ongoing parasite exposure. Giardia cysts are cold-tolerant, immediately infective and few are needed to establish infection. Thus, musk oxen may now maintain Giardia Assemblage A in the absence of reservoir hosts or ongoing introductions and may serve as a source for infection for other species. Untyped Giardia species previously reported in Peary caribou on Banks Island may represent overspill from musk oxen. Behaviour of people and musk oxen also affords several opportunities for ongoing transmission between these hosts and between terrestrial and marine systems. In summer, spatial overlap between residents of Sachs Harbour, tourists and musk oxen is common, as all tend to concentrate around major water bodies. High abundance of Giardia infection in the large musk ox population results in significant contamination of water bodies and, because latrines are rare in this vast landscape, contamination of the land and water bodies with human faeces is likely. Residents and tourists often drink untreated water directly from these water bodies. Human sewage from Sachs Harbour, deposited untreated in a sewage pond accessible to wildlife, provides ongoing opportunities for parasite dispersal, as do the commercial musk ox harvests that are held almost every winter near the community. People working at these harvests may be directly exposed to cysts in the offal. Additionally, for many years this offal was disposed of untreated on the land near the temporary abattoirs used for the harvests, and more recently has been deposited on the sea ice. These disposal practices may provide a source of infection for people and terrestrial and marine wildlife. So we can see here that there may be links between climate change and diseases in large terrestrial mammals, and there could be links with either native human populations and/or tourists. However, further research is needed to establish the role of tourists, if any, in this dispersal process.",

This migration is interrupted during the summer months to feed, give birth and nurse young in Manitoba's northern river estuaries. In association with the annual beluga migration, a thriving whale-watching industry has also developed a strong presence in northern Manitoba. We need to identify if there are any actual or potential problems associated with this industry. Beluga has always been an important resource for peoples living in northern Manitoba. Historically, Inuit, Cree and Dene hunted beluga as a food source. The outer skin and fat layer provided a source of vitamins and energy in the form of 'maqtaak'. The nutrient-rich meat was also eaten by people and was an important food source for sled dogs. Present-day subsistence harvests by Inuit continue in some areas of Nunavut and northern Manitoba (north of Churchill), but it is no longer a current practice by First Nations in Manitoba. The presence of large numbers of beluga also contributed to the development of a commercial whaling from the late 1800s in Churchill and York Factory. Churchill was the most active site for this industry. Various companies operated up until 1968, when the whale-processing factory closed in Churchill. A small operation that captured live belugas for aquarium display operated in Churchill from 1967 to 1992.",

Over time, some tour operators have developed an informal, self-regulating 'Code of Conduct' which includes many proactive measures to support thriving beluga whale populations in these estuaries. Some of the measures include reduced speed when manoeuvring around whales, 'sharing whales' by limiting the number of boats surrounding whale groups and taking turns when viewing. Some operators have also installed propeller guards to protect belugas from moving parts of the boat and work to dissuade tourists from physical contact with belugas. However, there seems a possible conflict between the beluga whale tourist boat operators and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), because recently in 2014 there was a DFO proposition to impose a maximum 50 m approach zone between a boat and the belugas, with apparently no consultation with the tour operators. This resulted in a detailed document from the Churchill Beluga Whale Tour Operators Association and the Town of Churchill (2015) suggesting that the belugas are thriving in these estuaries and that the belugas are habituated to the presence of tour operators activities (viewing from boats, snorkelling, kayaking) and that there is no apparent impact on their life processes. The document suggests that a maximum 50 m approach would be impossible to implement as the belugas are curious and approach the boats, rather than the other way round, and that the voluntary understanding of policies and protocols in place has worked well for decades. They point out many inconsistences in the new suggested regulations. The importance of the summer beluga viewing to the tourist industry in Churchill was emphasised (it constitutes 8.9% of the tourism base), and if these new DFO regulations were implemented it would destroy this industry. What is needed is more research on the possible recreational disturbance on the beluga populations, especially as it is known that both belugas and narwhals are sensitive to seismic noise and icebreakers (Cucknell et al. 2015) , although there are clearly major differences in type of noise disturbance here.",

The peak traffic here increased between 2003 and 2012 as a result of the development of newly established whalewatching companies in the upper estuary in some sectors of the beluga's critical habitat. This takes place in July and August, when the beluga give birth. An above-average number of dead calves was also observed in the period 2010-2012, and the population seems to be facing a decrease. This is thought to be due to a combination of the marine traffic, persistent organic pollutants and occasional toxic algal blooms (Lair 2013). Hence there seems to be a difference between the impacts of noise and disturbance caused by shipping on beluga populations in the estuaries in the Churchill area and in the St Lawrence, and there seems to be a need for more research into the effects of recreation on the beluga.",

However, there are potential conflicts with tourism, and, until recent years, the Inuvialuit were virtually powerless to resolve these conflicts. Starting in 1984, formal mechanisms became available for the Inuvialuit to achieve both their economic needs and social objectives. The Inuvialuit Final Agreement, signed in 1984, covers an area of 72,000 sq. km and includes the six communities of Inuvik, Aklavik, Tuktoyaktuk, Holman, Paulatuk and Sachs Harbour. Section 14 of the agreement provides the Inuvialuit with exclusive rights to hunt all marine mammals, establishes a co-management body for marine mammals and fish (the Fisheries Joint Management Committee, or FJMC) and gives the Inuvialuit the first priority for wildlife-related guiding, outfitting and other commercial activities (DIAND 1984) . A second mechanism is Canada's 1997 Oceans Act. The Oceans Act addresses the integrated management of activities in coastal, marine and estuarine waters of Canada, and contains language that provides for the inclusion of 'bodies established under land claims agreements' and other stakeholders, specifically mentioning 'affected aboriginal organizations, coastal communities and other persons' (Section 31).

The tourism guidelines have specific clauses, such as those against the harassment of marine mammals that are enforceable under the Federal Fisheries Act, the National Parks Act and the Territorial Travel and Tourism Act and Regulations. The tourism guidelines have provisions to designate areas where tourism may take place, to require tour operators to obtain HTC and the camp owner's permission if they are to visit whale hunting camps, to establish tour lengths, to prohibit photographing and filming of certain hunting activities, to prohibit low-level flying over whales and whaling areas, to require tourists and tour operators to remove all refuse from activity sites and to leave cultural artefacts as they were found (FJMC 1998) . In particular, the BSBMP has power to establish zoning, with one zone where subsistence activities take priority over water-based tourism. The tourism guidelines require aeroplanes to fly no lower than 2500 feet over any area designated as a subsistence zone, but such provisions are difficult to enforce.

            "text": "The unsuccessful integration of whale-watching and whaling camp visits with whale harvesting has also particular consequences for the nature-based tourism industry. Owing to the sensitive nature and politics involved in whalewatching, most tour operators mentioned they would not become involved in this activity. Accordingly, this segment of the nature-based tourism market has become increasingly marginalised. It is thought by some locals that tourism could harm the beluga whales, and they mentioned the noise of charter planes, the approach of the independent marine kayaker and the noise of outboard motors ('kickers'), which scared the whales out of the shallower waters (where hunting typically occurs) into deeper waters. One elder from Inuvik commented on changes in beluga behaviour as affected by boats: 'the beluga do run and they do stop and they seem to be disturbed.' Similarly, an Inuvialuit man from Aklavik mentioned that during weekends, when boat traffic was heavier owing to hunting, it was more difficult than usual to harvest whales; he thought that it was the noise of 'kickers' that disturbed the whales. Thus, hunting boats as well as tour boats may harass beluga.",

Similarly, lowlevel flight excursions have been known to harass beluga whales as well ). Whether from a cruise ship or out of Inuvik or Tuktoyaktuk, it is the emergence of highly mobile transportation means (zodiacs, hovercraft, small aircraft and helicopters) that allows tourists to move even closer to the whales. Since the peak of the tourism season coincides with beluga calving, it is anticipated the tourists may now want to see birthing and rearing. It has been documented that if boats get too close, they can cause the separation of young beluga calves from their mother. When separated experimentally, calves may transfer their attachment to the side of a nearby ship, potentially not to return to their mother (Edington and Edington 1986) . A study on the St Lawrence beluga whale population found that, when ecotourism boats interacted with beluga whales, the belugas would show subtle surface avoidance; feeding and travelling belugas would generally terminate and not resume their activity (Blane and Jackson 1994) . Further north, Fraker et al. (1997) found that beluga whales congregating in estuarine areas react by avoiding boat and barge traffic within approximately 2.5 km. They found that when boats passed beluga travel paths, this would hinder and then delay the passage of the whales for several hours. The same study found that aircraft flying at an altitude of less than 200 m caused beluga to panic into a random pattern characterised by thrashing and wheeling.",

Any impact from these tourists is difficult to gauge, but it must be limited because of the small numbers of people involved on each tour and per year, and it is never going to be anything other than a specialised niche market because of the costs involved, not only in the adventure package itself but also the cost of charter flights from Ottawa to Pond Inlet.",

The seals congregate in large groups on pack ice in late February/early March to give birth, nurse and mate. The seals' behaviour during and after visits by tourists was compared with behaviour observed at undisturbed sites by observers accompanying daily helicopter flights from a land base on Prince Edward Island. Virtually every aspect of the mothers' behaviour and of their pups was significantly affected by the presence of the tourists. The mothers' attendance was significantly reduced, and those that remained with their pups when tourists were present spent significantly more time alert and less time nursing their pups. Non-nursing social interactions occurred less frequently. Females with young pups were particularly aggressive and occasionally lashed out at their own pups, biting or clawing them when approached. Pups were more active when tourists were present, resting less and changing location more frequently. They also spent significantly more time alert and engaged in agonistic behaviour. When tourists approached to within 3 m or touched the pups, the pups frequently showed a freeze response that was only observed in this context. Pup age and tourist behaviour affected the degree of disturbance: for example, if there was a lot of tourist activity or loud noise a large area was disturbed. Tourist groups that made modest attempts to minimise disturbance, such as walking calmly or slowly into areas containing seals, had discernibly less impact. After the tourists left, most females returned to their pups promptly and behaviour characteristic of undisturbed situations usually resumed within one hour.",

However, there appeared to be no evidence of abnormal abandonment or life-threatening Thorburn (1920)) injury resulting from the tourists' visits. If some distance is maintained between tourists and the seal pups, then many mothers remain much calmer (a distance probably of 10 m seems best). If the tourists remain relatively quiet, move more slowly and crouch or remain seated, seal disturbance is greatly reduced. The tendency of most tourists was to move from pup to pup, which resulted in a very transient disturbance to individual seals. The results from this work showed that disturbance from tourists occurred, but at the level of tourism in the late 1980s this was not great, especially if education of the tourists and tour companies occurred regarding simple and fairly obvious behaviour protocols, such as minimum distance and no touching of the animals.",

The results of the survey of tourists on the grey seal trips showed that they were aware of their potential impacts upon the wildlife, and were generally supportive of the voluntary codes in place. Therefore if an honest explanation and interpretation of the potential impacts of seal tourism are provided, it may encourage a protectionist predisposition in wildlife tourists and ren-der the compliance of voluntary codes a highly satisfactory tourist experience rather than a negative one.

He explains that helicopter noise evokes a greater 'escape' from caribou than do fixed-wing aircraft However, both planes and helicopters affect caribou during calving and wintering periods, and it is cows and calves that are the most sensitive during these times (Fishman 1994) .",

For the Beaufort Delta region, it is particularly important that low-flying helicopters and cruise ships, as well as kayakers and canoeists, be prohibited close to all breeding areas. The sudden disturbance of shorebird colonies nesting on crags can cause their eggs to be knocked off as they fly off in panic (Edington and Edington 1986) . The increased number of tourists to Herschel Island means that there are more threats to the important breeding bird communities as the main tourist arrivals tend to coincide with the latter stages of egg incubation and hatching (Talarico and Mossop 1998) .",

            "text": "Owing to a high preponderance of recreational vehicles (RVs) coming in off the Dempster highway, there is also potential for considerable impact on the Beaufort Delta's terrestrial environment. Much of the tundra vegetation found around tourism 'hot spots', such as in Tuktoyaktuk, is particularly vulnerable to damage from visitor trampling. As nature-based tourists embark on hikes from recreational campsites (where most RVs are stationed) or tour bases, they often follow the same path, eventually compacting plants and exposing soil to the sun and wind. Vegetative compaction by tents occurs at campsites, and at remote rural locations. Damage to tundra vegetation helps to accelerate erosion of the land, which is no longer protected from runoff, wind and sun. Erosion can result, with gully erosion increasing trail width and depth, the development of muddy stretches and the development of parallel trails, often considered as shortcuts ('informal trails'). The fragility of the tundra landscape is illustrated through the everlasting presence of cart tracks on Melville Island left in 1819 by a British expedition (Hampton and Cole 1988) . This fragility was also illustrated by Forbes (1998) from close to Clyde River (Baffin Island), where the cumulative impacts resulting from single-and multi-pass vehicles tracks running perpendicular to a 3-4\u00b0 slope were noted. Changes could be induced by single passages of the tracked vehicle and the effects were persistent for twenty years. The effects of disturbance spread far from the point of the initial impact, even when there was just a single pass. The soil temperature regime and the plant nutrient regime were greatly altered from the initial vehicle disturbance and represented locally significant cumulative impacts. The general effect was to eliminate aquatics and stimulate the growth of lichens and shrubs. The vegetation could recover but not to the prior diversity levels and/or biomass. The greatest concentration of vegetative trampling mentioned in Dressler (1999) was perceived to be upon and around the larger pingos ( Fig. 6.11) . Once the vegetative covering and Environment Canada (2001) and the Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) created a set of guidelines for seabird viewing by cruise ships:",

Community members were looking for industries that were environmentally friendly, which ruled out mining. Since mining was out, tourism became the key.

When CTFN achieved self-government, the first thing it did was prepare a full infrastructure and land management plan. Yet, in order for Carcross to capture a larger share of Yukon visitors and encourage them to extend their stay, CTFN had to develop a comprehensive plan consisting of practices, operating structure, systems, businesses and activities that would create the right environment to entice tourists to make longer visits, satisfy the concerns and interests of Carcross citizens and attract investors and partners. For the strategy to be successful, it was important that CTFN should have the active involvement of cruise ship companies and Carcross citizens, and strategies to achieve economic growth. CTMC realised the strategy needed to be focused on establishing destination products. This effort started with building mountain bike trails, opening a carving centre, Skookum Jim's museum and a new visitor information centre, and attracting many new entrepreneurs and partners to the town. Vital to all this was catering to the many existing tourists arriving from Skagway's cruise liners. Cruise ship companies control rail travel in the region and many tour packages that are offered to tourists, such as mountain bike or hiking trips. Whatever CTFN built had to meet their standards and fulfil needs identified by cruise ship companies, including any tour company partners, to encourage them to increase their customers' time in Carcross and promote other activities. CTFN listened to the community and tour companies. Consequently, CTFN's business corporation, Carcross Tagish Management Corporation (CTMC), established partnerships with Alaska Excursion and other specialist tour companies. These companies bring jeeps with mountain bikes to the community and shop in the Carcross Commons.",

In 2006, with very little to do in the community outside their family, an increasing number of young people were turning to dangerous behaviour, such as alcohol, drugs and other activities. Community leaders wanted to reverse this trend by providing young people with something they could call their own. Trails development was built by the Singletrack to Success (S2S) project with the support of the Government of Yukon Sport and Recreation Branch and Community Development Fund, the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency and Tagish Lake Gold Corporation. The project started with fifteen youths aged fourteen or over working closely with community leaders. While carving trails, leaders taught them how to plan and build trails, identify plants, protect heritage sites, understand traditional place-names and have an appreciation of nature. Leadership was key, especially having the chief champion of the programme address some community members' concerns that the trails would harm the mountain, wildlife and natural environment, and that Tagish Mountain Hero trail in Carcross, just outside Whitehorse, was granted epic status in 2011; the International Mountain Bike Association (IMBA) states that the Mountain Hero trail offers stunning alpine views, historic mining artefacts and a chance to see caribou and other wildlife (IMBA 2012). Rowsell and Maher (2017) discuss the attributes of the Yukon trails, mentioning their uniqueness in terms of their remoteness and also their scenery, with views of mountains and forests, and alpine riding above the treeline (Fig. 6.12) . The trail builders have designed trails around historic landmarks (mining activities), scenic views and alpine areas to give a sense of remoteness very different from the experiences of the mountain bikers' home environment and to give a distinctive adventure tourism experience.",

Data is compiled from the Canadian Coast Guard, NORDREG, Iqaluit. 'Ships present' refers to the number of different cruise ships that appeared in the Canadian Arctic defined as the NORDREG zone. The 'Number of voyages' depicts their movements within the NORDREG zone: a voyage begins when a ship enters the NORDREG zone and ends when it exits. Thus, several cruises may take place within the same voyage in the sense NORDREG gives to this statistic.

Most of the operators surveyed by Lasserre and T\u00eatu (2015) communicated their lack of interest in expanding their business activities or in entering the Canadian cruise tourism market, with only three signalling their interest. Several underlined problems that appeared to them to hinder growth potential severely. Similarly, it is considered that a diversification of cruise itineraries and a modest increase in cruise tourism activities in the future are more realistic expectations, yet we might not witness the realisation of these expectations without significant development of marine infrastructures and a revision of regulations in the Canadian Arctic waters.",

However, the analysis of cruise activity in the Hudson Bay region illustrates considerable variability and shows that a change in distribution of cruise activity may be under way. North West Passage tours are among the most popular expedition cruises in Arctic Canada because of the combination of good wildlife viewing opportunities, the spectacular scenery and unrivalled opportunities to witness the relics associated with the historical exploration of the route. The latest example is Hurtiguten's August 2020 cruise, involving full transit of the North West Passage by the new MS Roald Amundsen (launched in May 2019). This voyage will set off from Nome (Alaska) to Halifax (Nova Scotia) and call at sites such as Ulukhaktok, Cambridge Bay, Gjoa Haven, Fort Ross, Beechey Island, Dundar Harbour and Pond Inlet, including a crossing of the Davis Strait and sites in western Greenland. The Hudson Bay region currently struggles to compete with these destination characteristics and will continue to do so, particularly when the southern reaches of the Canadian Arctic transition faster to an ice-free summer. In the long term, the focus for cruise operators wishing to remain active in the Hudson Bay region, if market conditions allow it, may require a shift toward more land-based tourism activities, such as those related to arts and crafts and Inuit culture.",

The ships may have a problem with National Parks and other sensitive areas as they may not have permits which are required before any landing, they may not recognise where the park boundaries are, as there is no signage indicating a National Park, and they may have a limited knowledge of, or not recognise, guidelines. The potential disturbance effects of cruise tourism on wildlife have already been discussed in earlier sections of this chapter, and cultural conflicts and misunderstandings are possible too, as we have seen from the Yukon.

            "text": "The maintenance of archaeological sites seemed to be an issue of great difficulty for some of the participants of Marquez's (2006) study. The desire to share archaeological finds with the tourists versus the need to protect a historically significant and often fragile site is the balance that the participants who work directly with the tourists struggle to achieve. Those who commented on the protection of these sensitive sites expressed a belief that 'it has to be one of those challenges that archaeological sites have to be maintained.' Many stakeholders understand the cultural value of the sites, and these remote archaeological sites are not only an incredible cultural resource but also a very strong indication of how long and how many people have been in the Arctic (Fig. 6 .14). One participant noted the difficulty with choices when faced with 'the destruction or degradation of cultural and historic sites; you don't want to fence it off but it's a fine balance and sometimes you just have to ask yourself whether it is worthwhile to keep things shut away or allow the tourists to have the experience with the risk of having it destroyed' (Marquez 2006) . There is a very fine line that tourists and tour operators must walk if they choose to visit sites of historical significance. A participant from a cruise operator suggests that guidelines are absolutely required in wilderness areas and archaeological sites. Archaeologists who work on the cruise ships, academics, cruise ship operators and cruise industry personnel struggle with the dilemma of wanting to share the incredible cultural treasures that are dispersed throughout the Arctic with a very real fear of overexposing these national relics to tourists. The creation and implementation of a guideline that would provide direction for the industry would be a solution to the current struggles that many participants face in regards to sensitive archaeological sites. However, it is clear that many archaeological sites elsewhere in the world are used currently for tourism. Learned experience from those sites should facilitate the development of guidelines and operational procedures that enable tourism use without damage. In 2005, for the first time, Nunavut actually required every cruise company that came in to the area and landed at a remote site to have an archaeologist, or someone designated as an archaeologist, on board the ship who was responsible for education relating to the sites. There had to be an application for a permit in advance to visit a site. The requirement to have an archaeologist on board each cruise ship was introduced to ensure that a qualified person who understands the true significance of sensitive archaeological sites will try to protect them. An example of the potential problems related to tourist visits to archaeological and historical sites comes from Herschel Island, off the northern Yukon coast. Here there is a rich cultural and historical heritage around Simpson Point and Pauline Cove and at Avadlek point at the southern end of the island, where there have been archaeological excavations (Herschel Island 2006) . There are many structures which range in age from precontact Thule cultures and historic buildings and structures developed by Inuvialiut, commercial whalers, traders, missionaries and the North West Mounted Police (see Appendix 3 Herschel Island 2018 for an inventory). There are also four graveyards (two Inuvialiut and one whalers and one North West Mounted Police), which, because of frost heaving processes, require management. There are also artefacts as well as Pleistocene mammalian fossils, which are often found along the beaches as the permafrost melts and erodes. All these sites and artefacts are vulnerable to potential tourist pressure, including trampling of the vegetation, destruction of structures and collection of artefacts. Currently the numbers of tourist visitors to Herschel Island is low (Herschel Island 2018) because of the difficulty of access, and number of cruise ships visiting over the last ten years has only been between one and three per year, with the number of visitors from these ships ranging from a low of 104 in 2005 to 534 in 2013. The total number of independent tourist ranged from a low of 22 in 2014 to 179 in 2006, and the number of tourist days ranged from a low of 42 in 2008 to 295 in 2006. Nevertheless, despite what we say in the next paragraph, management of cultural and historical sites visited by tourists, particularly cruise tourists, needs careful monitoring throughout the Canadian Arctic, and education does remain the key to preservation and conservation of these sites.",

(2017) found that, unlike mainstream cruises, tourists on expedition cruises to the Canadian Arctic are motivated by opportunities for novel experience and for learning. The educational programme offered by expedition cruise companies was an important component of their cruise experience. It was found that this programme has positively impacted cruise tourist attitudes, behaviours and knowledge post-cruise. These findings should encourage cruise companies to improve their educational offerings (i.e., preparedness, programme quality, level of engagement) to meet the expectations of their clientele, thereby transferring critical knowledge of environmental stewardship. It was suggested by Maher (2012) that this area of education of the clientele was being done well by operators in the Canadian Arctic. The use of the 'Linblad pattern' on these small vessels with zodiac trips to sites may help to creating a behavioural code, even if none exists in the regulations. There is a positive community engagement/educational opportunity for Inuit to dispel myths about living in, and their relationship to, the Arctic environment. In some communities a regular audience of cruise visitors to traditional throat singing, Arctic sports and drum dancing activities will help to make the tourists understand the local culture both in the past and present. This should again help in environmental stewardship by the participants.",
