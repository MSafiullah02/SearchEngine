A large population based case-series study found a relative risk ratio of 4.95 for acute myocardial infarction in the first 3 days following respiratory tract infections [5] . Influenza is recognized as a major risk factor for the occurrence of acute ischemic cardiovascular events in the elderly population. Epidemiologic evidence consistently proves a decrease in cardiovascular mortality following vaccinations with influenza [6] .
