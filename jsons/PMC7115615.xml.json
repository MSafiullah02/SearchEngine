The 2-hydrazolyl-4-thiazolidinone-5-carboxylic acid derivatives have shown promising activity on the cruzipain protease [12]. The most promising compound in series of aryl-4-oxothiazolylhydrazones was shown to be very active at non-cytotoxic concentrations in in vitro assays against Trypanosoma cruzi cell cultures and exhibited potency comparable with the reference compounds (IC50 (Y strain) = 0.3 \u03bcM) [9].

In all experiments, log-phase parasite cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 3000\u00d7g and immediately used. Drug assays were based on the conversion of a redox-sensitive dye (resazurin) to a fluorescent product by viable cells as previously described [45]. Drug stock solutions were prepared in pure DMSO. T. brucei bloodstream forms (105 cells/ml) were cultured in 96-well plates either in the absence or in the presence of different concentrations of inhibitors in a final volume of 200 \u03bcl. After a 72-h incubation, resazurin solution was added in each well at the final concentration of 45 \u03bcM and fluorescence was measured at 530 nm and 590 nm absorbance after a further 4-h incubation. The percentage of inhibition of parasite growth rate was calculated by comparing the fluorescence of parasites maintained in the presence of drug to that of in the absence of drug. DMSO was used as control. Concentration inhibiting 50% of parasite growth (IC50) was determined from the dose\u2013response curve with a drug concentrations ranging from 10 \u03bcg/ml to 0.625 \u03bcg/ml and presented in \u03bcM. IC50 value is the mean +/\u2212 the standard deviation of three independent experiments.",
