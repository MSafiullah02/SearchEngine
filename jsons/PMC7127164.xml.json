Edward Jenner was the first to vaccinate against smallpox in 1796. Jenner found that an inoculation of the pus from a cowpox lesion on a handmaid's hand to patients infected with smallpox conferred immunity (Stern and Markel, 2005). The aim of every vaccination is to present a particular antigen or set of antigens to the immune system in order to elicit immunity to the pathogen. In addition to the efficient elicitation of immune response, the ideal vaccine should be safe, show long-term stability at ambient temperatures, demonstrate high population coverage, and provide protection after the administration of a single dose. Moreover, the manufacturing, purification, and characterization processes should be effective, require a minimal number of steps, and be affordable to enable broad vaccine use.",

            "text": "The oldest type of vaccines or traditional vaccines consist of either live attenuated and killed microorganisms or inactivated toxins (Skwarczynski and Toth, 2011). The development of these vaccines uses the whole organisms, which is why they are more effective and elicit long-lasting innate and adaptive immune responses (Karch and Burkhard, 2016). Despite these benefits, traditional vaccines have some disadvantages, such as a risk of infection, probability of allergic and autoimmune reactions, and difficulties related to culture, production, and stability. Moreover, they cannot be developed for some diseases, such as cancer and several infectious diseases. Therefore, a new type of vaccines, named subunit vaccines, has been developed that has many advantages compared to the whole organism-based vaccines, including a lack of pathogenic organisms, safety, ease of production, stability, and low allergic and autoimmune responses. Hence, these vaccines are considered efficient (Skwarczynski and Toth, 2011, Skwarczynski and Toth, 2014). Based on the mentioned merits, many researchers, including our team, have worked extensively on the development of these types of vaccines (Farhadi et al., 2015, Hajighahramani et al., 2017, Mahmoodi et al., 2016, Nezafat et al., 2017, Nezafat et al., 2014, Nezafat et al., 2016, Shahbazi et al., 2016).",

They encapsulate antigens and carry them to the target cells, i.e., immune cells. Among this type of nanoparticles, polylactic acid (PLA), chitosan, poly lactide-co-glycolide acid (PLGA), poly glutamic acid (PGA), polypeptides, polyethylene glycol, and their copolymers are the most typical polymers. However, PLGA, which is applied to encapsulate antigens from different pathogens, such as Plasmodium vivax, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and Bacillus anthracis, and PGA, which is used to entrap hydrophobic antigens, are the two most widely used polymers due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability (Azmi et al., 2014, Skwarczynski and Toth, 2011, Zhao et al., 2014). Recently, thermo-responsive synthetic polymers (TRP) nanoparticles based on the N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM), and N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) polymers, which are able to self-assemble into immunogenic particles at physiologic temperatures, have been developed for the co-delivery of toll like receptor 7 and 8 agonists (TLR-7/8a) as adjuvants and immunogens such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion (F) protein trimers. TRP nanoparticles induce broad-based humoral and cellular immune responses; moreover, they are stable, soluble, filterable, colloidally dispersed, and unimolecular during purification and storage phases (Francica et al., 2016, Lynn et al., 2015). Currently, various vaccines based on polymeric nanoparticles are being tested in pre-clinical and clinical trials as treatments for different diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cancer, and tuberculosis (Bolhassani et al., 2014) (Table 1).",

Gold nanoparticles are more widely used in vaccine delivery compared to the other nanoparticles.

Lipidation leads to the formation of amphiphiles, which improve diffusion across epithelial barriers and provide stability against degradation agents (Golkar et al., 2016a, Golkar et al., 2016b, Zhao et al., 2014). These structures target vaccines to DCs and stimulate the activation of these cells through self-adjuvant properties. Lipid-based nanoparticles may have different structures, such as emulsions, including oil-in-water or water-in-oil forms, an immunostimulating complex (ISCOM), which is a cage-like lipid particle (Zhao et al., 2014), and liposomes (Golkar et al., 2016c, Tavakoli et al., 2015). Among these three types, liposomes are broadly used and are composed of biodegradable and non-toxic natural or synthetic bilayer phospholipids that surround an aqueous core (Azmi et al., 2014). In vaccine formulations, the antigenic determinants, which are most often peptide-based antigens, integrate within the lipid bilayer of liposomes and are protected from enzymatic degradation. Moreover, liposome-antigen complexes efficiently stimulate cellular immune response because of their nature. Therefore, liposome-based structures are potential efficient vaccine adjuvants (Azmi et al., 2014, Skwarczynski and Toth, 2011, Skwarczynski and Toth, 2014). Currently, several liposomal vaccines are being tested in clinical studies (Table 1).",

In fact, VLPs are recombinant, self-assembled capsid proteins with an ideal diameter of 20\u2013100 nm that are non-infectious and non-replicating. Therefore, they have been applied as an effective diagnostic approach and in drug, DNA, peptide, protein, and vaccine delivery. For vaccine delivery, a variety of different antigens have been genetically or chemically fused to the VLPs and presented on their surface. These VLPs strongly stimulate the immune system without the need for adjuvant, because they mimic the structure of native viruses (Azmi et al., 2014, Yang et al., 2016). In fact, VLPs induce the innate immune response by activating TLRs and pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), as well as humoral immune response, particularly IgM. Due to the particulate nature of VLPs, they also increase the uptake of antigens by APCs. Currently, a few approved VLP-based vaccines are available on the market, including a recombinant hepatitis B virus vaccine and the human papilloma virus vaccines. Several VLP vaccines are also being tested in clinical trials for different diseases (Shirbaghaee and Bolhassani, 2016) (Table 1, Table 2).",

Water-mediated hydrogen bonds are also very important in biological systems, where molecules primarily contact water.

Since then, self-assembled peptides have been employed to produce a broad range of materials, such as nanofibers (Yanlian et al., 2009, Zhang, 2003), nanowires (Sun et al., 2016), nanorings (Carlson et al., 2006, Shah et al., 2016), nanotubes (Hartgerink et al., 1996, Scanlon and Aggeli, 2008), and nanoparticles (Kaba et al., 2009, Raman et al., 2006), among others.

Peptidic self-assembled nanostructures have been used as peptide surfactants (Mandal et al., 2014, Zhao and Zhang, 2006), membranes for separation and purification (Busseron et al., 2013), or research models of protein folding and protein conformational disease studies, in addition to enzyme immobilization and blood cell substitution (Doll et al., 2015a, Zhao and Zhang, 2006). Some nanoscale self-assembled peptides possess a central cavity, which enables them to carry drugs or genes, and have been used for controlled drug release, gene, and drug delivery (Doll et al., 2015a, Habibi et al., 2016). SAPNs have also been harnessed in 2D and 3D cell-cultures, for reparative and regenerative medicine, tissue engineering (Yu et al., 2016), as pharmacological antagonists (Yu et al., 2016), in imaging, as biosensors, and in diagnostic device development (Busseron et al., 2013, Habibi et al., 2016, Hauser and Zhang, 2010). They have also shown antimicrobial and anticancer activities in some studies (Roy et al., 2013). One promising application of SAPNs is in vaccine development (Kaba et al., 2009, Zhang et al., 2014, Zhao et al., 2014), which will be discussed further in the next section.",

Two structural features of SAPNs, molecular specificity and multivalency, make them suitable vaccine adjuvants and carriers. The high antigen density and structurally ordered antigen arrangement on SAPNs resembles the recognition patterns on pathogens and thus facilitates the cross-linking of antigens with the BCRs (L\u00f3pez-Sagaseta et al., 2016). This multivalent interaction is a key step in provoking a potent immune response and is a solution for the weak immunogenicity of subunit vaccines. In fact, SAPNs elicit high titers of high affinity neutralizing IgG in addition to CD8 + T-cell-mediated protection (Chen et al., 2013, Chesson et al., 2014). They not only trigger complement activation but also help in creating microenvironments that promote the interaction of the vaccine with APCs (Eskandari et al., 2016, Hubbell et al., 2009). Therefore, SAPNs have been used in both prophylactic and immunotherapeutic vaccines (Hubbell et al., 2009). The incorporation of antigens on self-assembled peptides and subsequent production of chimeric SAPNs is accomplished through a direct self-assembly process or covalent chemical bonding of antigens to nanoparticles (L\u00f3pez-Sagaseta et al., 2016). SAPNs with \u03b2-sheet and coiled-coil structures have been studied by several groups as vaccine carriers and/or adjuvants (El Bissati et al., 2014, Karch and Burkhard, 2016); however, more research is needed.",

One approach is to synthesize the SAPN systems first, followed by their functionalization with epitopes under proper conditions to achieve a vaccine construct (Friedrich et al., 2016, Rudra et al., 2012b). Using this method, epitopes are covalently attached to both termini and presented on the surface of the peptide nanofibers, while preserving their immunogenicity and eliciting high antibody titers and cellular responses in mice, without the need for any adjuvants (Branco et al., 2011). Alternatively, peptide monomers that include the self-assembling domain and epitopes may be produced by expressing recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli hosts, which will be self-assembled after production (El Bissati et al., 2014, Kaba et al., 2012, Pimentel et al., 2009). The self-assembling peptide may be synthesize alone or in tandem with the epitope via the solid phase peptide synthesis method with high purity (Chen et al., 2013, Coin et al., 2007, Rudra et al., 2010). The amino acid pairing (AAP) strategy has also been used for SAPN synthesis. This method is based on three major interactions (hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attractions, and hydrophobic interactions) that are created between the amino acid side chains of a self-assembling peptide with an adjacent peptide molecule (Eskandari et al., 2016, Fung et al., 2011). Although this approach was used to fabricate \u03b2-sheet fibrils for drug delivery (Sadatmousavi, 2009), it may also be applied to vaccine design.",

These repeats can further assemble to form open linear structures with a helical curvature or closed ring structures with rotational symmetries (Huang et al., 2016). The generated SAPNs in this class may also possess \u03b2-sheet structures, such as \u03b2-trefoil (Broom et al., 2012, Longo et al., 2014), \u03b2-propeller (Voet et al., 2014), and TIM barrels (Huang et al., 2016). Many of these structures are either natural or synthetic scaffolds. These repeat proteins may be generated through gene duplication and fusion of a single repeat. The geometric constraints of linear repeat proteins are lower than cyclic proteins. Moreover, they can adopt various supramolecular forms, some of which may not exist in nature (Norn and Andr\u00e9, 2016). The supramolecular shapes should be controlled either through computational de novo design (Brunette et al., 2015, Doyle et al., 2015, Park et al., 2015) or by using slightly different oligomeric repeats to produce structures with predefined geometries for these molecular architectures (Ramisch et al., 2014). Additionally, different conformational repeats may be used to generate structures with a non-uniform curvature (Park et al., 2015).",

Otherwise, the oligomeric units may adopt different orientations, leading to irregular assemblies. Generally, in epitope vaccines, linkers, which are short sequences that are sensitive to proteasomal degradation (Nezafat et al., 2014), are commonly used for two reasons: separating the antigenic domains (Arai et al., 2001) to prevent the generation of junctional epitopes (neoepitopes) and promoting the processing and presentation of HLA-II binding epitopes (Nezafat et al., 2016). In SAPNs, different types of linkers are being employed for architectural purposes according to the desired structure (Lai et al., 2012).",

Bioinformatics provides great help for researchers aiming to generate predictions before performing lab experiments to design SAPNs, similar to some other fields (Negahdaripour et al., 2016, Negahdaripour et al., 2017, Rahmatabadi et al., 2016, Zamani et al., 2015), which helps save time and energy (Negahdaripour et al., 2017, Rahmatabadi et al., 2016). On the other hand, the use of computational tools in vaccine design or SAPN development seems unavoidable, considering the huge volume of data that must be compiled. SAPN design usually begins with an initial computer design that calculates the expected molecular mass, diameter, and symmetry in advance. In the past few years, other factors that impact design complexity, such as the rotational and translational degree of freedoms (Marsh et al., 2013) and different competing assembly states with similar stabilities (Fleishman and Baker, 2012, Ramisch et al., 2015), have been also calculated computationally. However, some deviations from the predicted models have been reported (Brunette et al., 2015). By taking advantage of molecular modeling and simulation programs, various \u03b1-helices and oligomerization domains have been combined to design novel self-assembling nanoparticles (Sanner et al., 2005). Moreover, point mutations within the oligomerization domains and adjacent to the linker, or within the linker, and their impacts on the assembly can be investigated with these programs (Ardejani and Orner, 2015). Additionally, protein stability has been optimized with computer programs by modifying surface polarity, core hydrophobicity, and backbone regularity (Netzer and Fleishman, 2016).",

Peptides composed of alternate hydrophilic (charged, polar) and hydrophobic (uncharged, nonpolar) amino acid repeats, which provide a backbone with amphiphilic properties, possess a tendency to form a \u03b2-sheet structure with one hydrophilic face and one hydrophobic face (Doll et al., 2013, Eskandari et al., 2016, Habibi et al., 2016, Zhang et al., 1993). These amino acid arrangements promote hydrogen bonds among residues (hydrogen donors and acceptors) in various polypeptide chains or in different parts of a folded polypeptide, resulting in parallel/anti-parallel sheet-like structures (Eskandari et al., 2016). Two sheets interact such that the surrounding aqueous media contacts the hydrophilic faces of the sheets, whereas the aqueous media is excluded from the hydrophobic faces (Doll et al., 2013). The \u03b2-sheet motif has been used to fabricate supramolecular structures. Various hierarchical structural arrays have been developed based on the number of packed sheets, such as tapes, ribbons, fibrils, and fibers (Fig. 5\n) (Eskandari et al., 2016, Kumar et al., 2011, Loo et al., 2012). However, under physiological conditions, these short peptides primarily self-assemble into \u03b2-sheet-rich nanofibers (Doll et al., 2013, Rudra et al., 2010).",

The mechanical characteristics of the self-assembled \u03b2-sheets are controlled by adjusting the molar ratio of enantiomeric peptides, where different ratios of L-peptides (composed of L-amino acids) and D-peptides (composed of D-amino acids) are applied to design self-assembled \u03b2-sheet structures. The use of chirality in peptide sequences may greatly enhance the stability of the prepared peptide scaffolds and protect them from enzymatic degradation (Eskandari et al., 2016, Nagy et al., 2011). Furthermore, polypeptides rich in alanine (A) and glycine (G) formed larger beta strands (Zhang et al., 2011).

A notable increase in the antibody titers and a significant inhibition of sporozoite infection were produced by the prepared self-assembled nanofibers. The antibody responses were both T-cell- and MyD88-dependent. Furthermore, two different epitopes self-assembled together without impacting the strength and duration of the antibody responses. These developed nanofibers were proposed to be a favorable platform for self-adjuvanting multi-antigenic immunotherapies (Karch and Burkhard, 2016, Rudra et al., 2012a).",

Astbury applied the first X-ray diffraction measurement of natural protein fibers (the keratins from wool, horsehair, and collagen) and discovered three main structures in native wool (a-form), in the denatured form (b-form), and in collagen (Astbury, 1933). Then, he observed meridional arcs of 5.15 \u00c5. He proposed that the \u03b1-helix may be deformed into a coiled-coil to clarify the 5.15 \u00c5 reflection on the meridian and indicated that the energy is involved in this deformation is likely to be small (Crick, 1953b). In the 1950s, L. Pauling at Caltech in the USA and L. Bragg at Cambridge in the UK attempted to interpret the meridional arcs observed at 5.15 \u00c5 (Pauling and Corey, 1950, Pauling et al., 1951). In the same year, L. Pauling, R. Corey, and H. Branson at Caltech in the USA elaborated mathematical models of 3.7 residues per turn and 5.1 residues per turn in an \u03b1-helical structure (Pauling et al., 1951). In 1952\u20131953, F. H. C. Crick (Cambridge, UK), L. Pauling, and R. Corey (Caltech, USA) separately submitted reports to Nature showing that the 5.15 \u00c5 diffraction pattern was attributed to the packing of two or more strands of \u03b1-helices (Crick, 1953b, Pauling and Corey, 1953). Subsequently, in 1953, Crick described the Fourier transform of a continuous coiled-coil domain, and, in a follow-up paper, explained that the knobs-in-holes configuration leads to the packing of \u03b1-helices in the form of coiled-coils (Apostolovic et al., 2010, Crick, 1952, Crick, 1953a, Crick, 1953b, Pauling and Corey, 1953).",

            "text": "The seven main factors that influence the stability of coiled-coils include: 1) the hydrophobicity of the core residues in positions \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018d\u2019, 2) the number of heptad repeats (a-b-c-d-e-f-g) n, 3) the helix melting temperature, as a high thermal stability and high binding constants result in reduced immunogenicity and a lower synthesis cost, 4) pH, as changes in pH induce unfolding of the coiled-coils by (de)protonation of the side chain functional groups of amino acids at residues \u2018e\u2019 and \u2018g\u2019, followed by disruption of the interchain salt bridges and destabilization of the coiled-coil, 5) specific interstrand interactions, such as disulfide bridges, 6) metal ions, which are important in direct protein folding, stabilization of the tertiary structure, or electron transfer and mainly influence the orientation of the helices in a coiled-coil, and 7) the helical propensity of amino acid residues in the remaining positions (Apostolovic et al., 2010). The amino acid sequence determines many aspects of coiled-coil binding, such as stability, the direction of binding (parallel or antiparallel), the oligomerization state (two or more peptides), size (2 nm\u2013200 nm long), rigidity, and homomeric or heteromeric binding (Robson Marsden and Kros, 2010). The coiled-coil domains of cartilage oligomerization matrix protein (COMP) (Malashkevich et al., 1996), tetrabrachion (Stetefeld et al., 2000), fibritin (Tao et al., 1997), and the GCN4 leucine zipper (O'Shea et al., 1991) are some of the well-known examples of \u03b1-helical coiled-coils and represent pentameric, tetrameric, trimeric, and dimeric coiled-coils, respectively (Yang et al., 2012).",

Their production process is environmentally friendly, as it does not involve the use of large amounts of chemicals (Zhao et al., 2017). Overall, SAPN fabrication is affordable and lacks complexity through its bottom up approach (Zhao and Zhang, 2006). Other advantages of SAPNs include their stability at high temperatures, resistance to enzymatic degradation, organic solvents and extreme pH values (Roy et al., 2013), as well as their symmetrical nature, modularity, responsiveness to stimuli (Yu et al., 2016), and bioactivity (Yang et al., 2012). The chemical diversity and possibility of structure design and engineering to match the specific needs (Fairman and Akerfeldt, 2005), which leads to their versatility (Mandal et al., 2014), are other merits. In other words, SAPNs can be synthesized from a variety of natural and non-natural amino acid building blocks with diverse characteristics (Webber et al., 2016).",

Some polymerization reactions may lead to the generation of several products with various lengths and molecular weights.

The toxicity and immunogenicity of polymers and carriers used in micelles have not yet been thoroughly studied, which is a concern in vaccine development (Yokoyama, 2014).

SAPNs have shown some benefits over other nano-structured systems used for vaccine development, and their usage in vaccine design is emerging due to their advantages of multivalency, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and molecular specificity. The orderly repetitive array of antigens on SAPNs structures and their small sizes resemble PAMPs, leading to strong immune reactions. SAPN vaccines are mainly constructed from coiled-coil or \u03b2-sheet biostructural motifs to which the immunodominant B- and T-cell epitopes for various antigens that protect against bacteria or viruses are fused. Under controlled conditions, coiled-coils and \u03b2-sheets assemble into single nanoparticles in a variety of forms. These structures act as carriers and immune adjuvants to enhance both humoral and cellular immunity.

Each of these structures has its own special features and potential, and different desired characteristics may be achieved by selecting appropriate building subunits. Because the identified repeat protein motifs are a minor part of all probable structures, many possibilities can be explored using synthetic biology. In this regard, in silico modeling will assist in the discovery of novel self-assembled peptides with more appropriate structures and effectiveness from thousands of available natural peptides. The ab initio design of building blocks will substantially increase the opportunities to develop novel SAPNs. However, the immunogenicity of novel synthetic oligomers should be carefully tested. The architecture and the assembly pathway both should be investigated and controlled to achieve higher success rates in accurate SAPN design. Additionally, the specificity of oligomerization should be improved. The use of immunoinformatics to select immunodominant epitopes in addition to structural biology and computational modeling to achieve the desired biomolecules may also help. Continuous progress in improving computational algorithms would be an undeniable support in this process. Overall, SAPN usage in vaccine design seems very promising.
