Education was designed and delivered according to the recipient's level of knowledge and readiness (as the patient population was comprised of healthcare workers and the general public) to ensure that the new knowledge was built on his/her existing understanding. More advanced knowledge about the illness and treatment would be provided to health care workers while non-technical language would be used when teaching the lay public. Special precautions were taken to protect the patients from infections including: drinking only bottled water, not allowing family to bring in home-cooked food, meticulous handwashing and discouraging patients from visiting one another.",

            "text": "As nosocomial infection is a key feature of SARS, precautionary measures were also taken to eliminate the risk factors leading to breakthrough infection among health care workers. For example, all potentially aerosol-generating procedures were avoided. These included diagnostic sputum induction, endotracheal intubation, nasopharyngeal aspiration, and the use of nebulizer and nebulized medication. In cases where intubation and assisted mechanical ventilation were required, patients were transferred to the SARS ICU where negative pressure room and closed suction system were available to prevent air leaks. Since lapses in infection control (for example, using one's hand to adjust the mask or goggle, forgetting to wash hands after patient contact) were linked to heavy workload and failed attention span, special measures were taken to ensure that the staff were not over-worked. These included instituting a lower nurse-patient ratio (1:4.5 for a 20-bedded SARS ward, 1:8 for a 30-bedded non SARS ward), providing more breaks while on duty, and scheduling a shorter working week. Nursing procedures, while essential for patient care, were also high-risk activities for nurses. In order to minimize the risk of prolonged exposure and extensive contact, a system of pairing up nurses, designed to improve efficiency and effectiveness, was instituted whenever nursing procedures were performed. To further reduce the risk of cross contamination, air-flow exchange cycle in SARS wards was increased from 7 to 11 per hour, beds were kept at 3 to 7 feet apart, and a distance of 3 feet was maintained between the patient and health care worker.",

Dyspnea could compromise the patient's ability to care for self, and the individual would become dependent on others. Yet close contact with health care personnel increased the risk of transmission of nosocomial infection. Depending on the degree of patient incapacity, nursing activities were carefully coordinated to minimize burden on the patient, while avoiding prolonged exposure for nurses. Involvement of patients in assessing their self-care needs facilitated joint decision making about what self-care activities the patient might manage and what assistance might be required. Educating the patients about their symptoms helped them to find alternative ways of coping.",

In addition, an infection control team should be set up in each hospital to enforce the precautionary measures, monitor staff compliance and identify areas for improvement. Also, each incident of breakthrough infection must be investigated immediately and thoroughly to find the cause.

At present, the patients are being followed up weekly after discharge in order to monitor their physical condition. To the best of our knowledge, there are no provisions to rehabilitate these patients, even though many of them believe they have experienced the worst ordeal in their life. Nurses are in close contact with these patients when they return for their follow-up visits, and are in an excellent position to assess, plan, implement and evaluate a comprehensive model of physical-psycho-social-spiritual care.

The valuable lessons learned during this crisis should not be forgotten and should indeed be the basis for strategic planning for future similar events. Among the lessons learned, the most obvious one is the importance of infection control. This was most acutely felt in the beginning of the outbreak when so little was known about the disease and health professionals had to resort to control tools (isolation and quarantine) dating back to the earliest days of empirical microbiology.23In the battle against SARS, we have learned that infection control is broader than just having standards and guidelines in place or having the provision of personal protective equipment. It encompasses surveillance, infrastructure and staff training. In the USA, the CDC has already shown that hospitals that conduct ongoing surveillance on nosocomial infections have a significantly lower infection rate than those without such programs.",

An administrative infrastructure with the establishment of a hospital-wide Infection Control Committee with proper support (Infection Control Officers, space, computers and clerical support) is also essential to contain the spread of SARS. Since such an infrastructure cannot be built in a day, health authorities should make a concerted effort to establish it before the next outbreak of SARS or other similar catastrophes. Any effort at instituting infection control is futile without the support of health professionals who have received formal training in infection control. Although staff education may appear to be costly, the reduction in the spread of SARS, as well as other communicable diseases and infections, would more than pay for the education program.",
