The metapopulation consists of susceptible and infected individuals that are grouped in subpopulations symbolising cities and villages that are coupled by human travel in a transportation network. By analytic methods and numerical simulations we calculate the fraction of infected people in the metaopoluation in the long time limit, as well as the relevant parameters characterising the epidemic threshold that separates an epidemic from a non-epidemic phase. Within this model, we investigate the effect of a heterogeneous network topology and a heterogeneous subpopulation size distribution. Such a system is suited for epidemic modeling where small villages and big cities exist simultaneously in the metapopulation. We find that the heterogeneous conditions cause the epidemic threshold to be a non-trivial function of the reaction rates (local parameters), the network's topology (global parameters) and the cross-over population size that separates \"village dynamics\" from \"city dynamics\".",

The infection model we assume is the wellestablished susceptible-infected-susceptible model (Sec. 2) where individuals can be in either a susceptible or an infected state and going from one state to the other is controlled by rates. For an isolated city or village, the fraction of infected individuals in the population in the final (stationary) state is fully determined by these rates. However, when the cities and villages in addition are exchanging people with each other, for instance on a transport network, the situation may be much more involved. Under such conditions, the final state is not only determined by the rates, but also depends on structural features of the network [10, 11] .",

The separation between these two phases (in parameter space) is known as the epidemic threshold. In this study we go beyond previous works and address the importance of city-size heterogeneity on the epidemic threshold. The size of the city or village is an important aspect because it sets the limit on how large fraction of the population a single individual actually meet within a given time period. The well-mixed approximation works poorly for a large city like New York whereas for a small countryside village it could be adequate. We therefore let the infection dynamics at each node change depending on how many individuals are present at any given time. In previous models, the network's topology only influenced how people, and thus the disease, spread between the nodes. Here we in addition let the dynamics adapt to the local instantaneous population density, which means that the network structure influence the disease dynamics in two ways. First, how individuals move, and second, how they interact on the nodes. The latter part is in practise achieved by introducing a population dependent infection rate that interpolates between the two limiting cases of \"the big city\" for which the infection rate is dropping with increasing population, and \"the small village\" where the infection rate remains independent of population size. Within this setting, we derive new analytic expressions for the epidemic threshold of a general network which interpolates between previously known cases. This paper is organized as follows; Section 2 is devoted to detailing the infection model that will be assumed. Here also the behavior of this model in homogeneous space is discussed. We then present how we model the transportation of individuals between the cities and villages (Sec. 3) before we in Sec. 4 present a unified reactiondiffusion model that combines the two phenomena from the previous two sections. Section 4 also presents analytic results for the epidemic threshold and compare them to simulations. The conclusions from this study are presented in Sec. 5.",

            "text": "In the previous section, we considered the dynamics of the SIS model under the assumption of an isolated, homogeneous well mixed population. It was shown that an epidemic phase may exist. However, humans are not uniformly distributed over the surface of the earth. Instead, throughout history, we have had the tendency to form local communities (\"subpopulations\"), i.e. areas where the population density is higher than in its surroundings. Today the population density of the world is rather heterogeneous, and the communities range in size from small villages, consisting of a few tens of people, to mega-cities or urban areas where many millions of people are living within a rather small area. A group of such spatially separated populations that are coupled to each other in one way or the other is called a metapopulation ( Fig. 1 ). Within one local community of a metapopulation one may argue that the SIS interactions (1) may take place essentially within homogeneous space, so that the epidemic threshold for that community is given by Eq. (7). However, for this equation to be correct one is required to neglect the exchange of people between the various communities of the metapopulation. Today we travel more than ever before; we visit neighboring villages and cities, we travel to further away regional centers, and do international travels to far away destinations for business or pleasure. Hence, the effect of the ever increasing human travel patterns [15] [16] [17] is that the population centers are coupled, something that in some cases (as we will see below) influences significantly the epidemic threshold. In our model, the nodes of the network represent population centers and the links connecting them correspond to the human traveling routes between such centers ( Fig. 1 ). An integrated world will be assumed; by this we mean that any node of the network can be connected to any other node by following the links of the network. Technically this is to say that the network is fully connected and therefore consists of one giant component [28] . We let the network consist of V nodes (or vertices), and let N p (i, t) denote the number of individuals of type p = I, S at population center (or node) i = 1, 2, . . . , V at time t. Thus, the population of node i at time t becomes N (i, t) = N S (i, t) + N I (i, t), and by summing over i, the total p-population becomes N p (t) = \u2211 i N p (i, t). Therefore, the total population of the whole network, independent of the type of individual, can be written as the time-independent constant N = N S (t) + N I (t). Furthermore, the topology of the complex network is described by the so-called adjacency matrix W [28, 29] . The components of this matrix, W ij \u2265 0, describe the weight or capacity of the traveling route from population center j towards population center i. To keep matters simple, we will assume that the links are symmetric: the capacity of the route j \u2192 i is equal to that of i \u2192 j (i.e. W ij = W ji ). Moreover, W ij = 0 means that no direct migration (or travel) is possible from j towards i.",

The equations on which such simulations are based are obtained by combining Eqs. (3) and (8) so that the relevant set of equations is of reaction-diffusion type. Motivated by the key question in epidemiology studies, we focus on the long time behavior of this reaction-diffusion system. Therefore, our primary interest will be the average nodal density of infected individuals in the stationary state of the system,\u03c1 I . The corresponding density of susceptibles is readily obtained as\u03c1 S = \u03c1\u2212\u03c1 I and will thus not be explicitly given. We recall from the preceding discussion that a non-trivial result\u03c1 I > 0 requires that initially N I (i, 0) > 0 for at least one node in the network. Therefore, it will from now onward be assumed that N I (i, 0) > 0 for some i's. Moreover, if D I is zero, there is no way that an initial infection can be transmitted in our model to other parts of the metapopulation. Since such a \"local infection\" is not a very interesting and/or realistic situation, we will require that D I > 0. \u03c1 \u03c1 \u00d7 (with \u03c1 \u00d7 = N \u00d7 V ) assuming that \u03b2 \u00b5 = 2.

Nonweighted simply means that the population density at given node is proportional its number of incoming links (see Eq. (9)). The simulation results shown in Fig. 2 (as solid lines) were obtained under the assumption of treating \u03c1 p (i, t) as a continuous variable to save computation time, and the networks were generated by the Molloy-Reed algorithm [35] . A stochastic simulation approach similar to that being used in Ref. [10] was also implemented. It was found to give equivalent results except for a higher expenditure of computer time.",

As the epidemic model we assumed the well-studied susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) system. This model exhibits an epidemic and a non-epidemic phase, of which the latter has a nonzero number of infected individuals in the long time limit. The transition between these states, the so-called epidemic threshold, depends non-trivially on the parameters of the model. These parameters are the infection and recovery rates, the cross-over population size separating small village dynamics from large city dynamics, and the topology of the network distributing the subpopulations within the metapopulation. We envision the network to symbolize 3 In practice we let km how cities and villages are interconnected in a transportation network, and human traveling patterns are assumed as simple as possible; People diffuse randomly. In principle, the diffusion rates also enter into the epidemic threshold, but here we only addressed either immobile and mobile susceptibles (D S = 0 or D S = 1). Instead, we paid special attention to a previously unexplored case, namely, city-size dependence on epidemic spreading. By city size we mean population density. It is an interesting aspect because a disease spreads quite differently in a small city (a village) compared to in a metropolitan city, and the most realistic situation is that all city sizes coexist within a metapopulation. We therefore formally let the local dynamics in each node adapt itself to the instantaneous local population density. In a diffusion model, the size of the city is proportional to the number of its links (we assume an undirected, non-weighted network). This means that the network's structural features enter the dynamics of the disease in two ways. First, how people migrate, and second, the dynamics in each node. Previous works have assumed that the individuals are infected in the same way in all nodes. Our main result is that we obtain (in the mean-field limit) and for a general network an implicit expression for the epidemic threshold expressed in terms of the model parameters. This expression shows good agreement with numerical simulations and its asymptotic behaviour interpolates between known limits.",

The results presented in this paper open for a better understanding of the position of the epidemic threshold and its complex interplay between the local infection parameters and the global parameters characterizing the network topology for a large class of diseases (SIS). Such knowledge may in the future prove critical for reducing the outbreak size, slowing down the speed of spreading and/or spatially confining infectious diseases. Moreover, if epidemic dynamics were better understood, our contemporary societies could earlier, and at better levels of accuracy, predict if a local outbreak has a risk of becoming a global pandemic. If an accurate early warning could be given, appropriate measures could be taken, for example by adjusting the production of vaccines, with the potential of saving numerous lives.",
