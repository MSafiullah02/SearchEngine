There has been a fall in global stock prices (Figure 2)\n3\n as well as oil price all due to quarantines, cancelation of flights by many airlines, factories shut down, and so forth.

Online services became the alternative for many dwellers, particularly in Wuhan. This alternative also came with some hurdles, as goods ordered took longer than expected to arrive. Moreover, newer policies barred door\u2010to\u2010door delivery services in some communities. Thus, individuals had to pick their ordered items at the community entrance further increasing their chances of contracting the virus. This could be described as inefficiency in the delivery market. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) or self\u2010driving cars provided by companies such as JD and Meitan came in to solve this market failure as it also helps to reduce the spread of the virus. Ordered goods were now loaded unto AVs at specified stations and then delivered to their destination within the communities.\n6\n JD's AVs which operated in Wuhan, for instance, delivered 24 smaller packages of orders per trip at a travel speed of 15 km/h.",

Interactions made via robots made treatment of sick patients easier, reduced disease transmission, and saved health workers time on simple tasks. Robots were now being used in communicating with isolated patients, disinfecting rooms, taking vital statistics, and delivering medications. In addition, meal delivery robots provided by Keenon Robotics reached people in hospitals and quarantine zones in more than 40 cities.\n7\n People who might be sick or not wearing masks, walking in open spaces were detected and alerted via powerful surveillance technologies, such as facial recognition enabled cameras and drones. Although potentially unreliable, infrared thermometers or thermometer guns increasingly become common in China, where people's temperatures were regularly checked by health workers.\n8\n\n",

For instance, a 50\u2010piece surgical mask sold on Amazon at \u00a310 early January 2020 shot up to \u00a3170 a few weeks later as the virus spread heightened (ibid). The World Health Organization (WHO) expressing concerns about some of this misleading information especially on Amazon helped rectify this anomaly. A million products with the claim of protecting patients against the coronavirus or even curing it have now been banned on Amazon. Furthermore, tens of thousands of overpriced health products from unscrupulous sellers have also been removed from the platform.",

Refunding unemployment insurance premiums, offering social insurance subsidies for SMEs, subsidies for employee training, the purchase of teleworking service products, and the extension period for the payment of social insurance premiums to the end of March. Others include the lowering of lending rates, whiles local banks are being encouraged to adjust loan repayment, extend maturity periods, or renew the loan without repayment for firms in heavily hit zones. In the case of exemptions, SMEs seriously affected by the epidemic and lease state\u2010owned assets are exempted from paying the first month's rent, and either halving or paying zero rents in the next 2 months. In all of these measures, it is instructive to note that some are specific to some regions as they are time\u2010bound and thus required to be adhered to to smoothen the production and operations of the affected SMEs and other businesses (ibid).",
