Several similarities and differences in the epidemiology, clinical features and management of SARS and MERS have been identified [3]. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses are enveloped positive strand RNA betacoronaviruses. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV isolated from bats share sequence homology with isolates from humans or civet cat isolates suggest that bats are reservoirs [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. In contrast to MERS-CoV where the Hajj and Umrah (mini-Hajj) continued to occur without any reported cases, whereas SARS had a significant economical impact. The estimated global economic cost of 100 billion; $US 48 billion in China alone [9], [10].",

In February\u2013March 2003, there were clusters of atypical pneumonia reported in Vietnam, Hong Kong, Canada, and Singapore [1], [13], [14], [15], [16]. All these clusters were linked to index patients who stayed on the ninth floor of a hotel in Hong Kong on February 21\u201322, 2003 [17]. Subsequently, SARS-CoV spread across 30 countries in 6 continents and resulted in a cumulative 8098 cases and 774 deaths (9.5%) [18] with a high rate (21%) of involvement of healthcare workers [19].",

There is increasing evidence of the presence of MERS antibodies in camels pointing them as possible reservoir or an intermediate host. In an initial study from 50 sera of dromedary camels (Camelus dromedaries) from Oman showed a high-titre of neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV [58]. Later on, multiple studies showed positive antibodies in camels from many countries including Spain (Canary Islands), Egypt, Qatar, KSA, UAE, and Jordan [48], [50], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65]. In addition, MERS-CoV was detected by PCR in 2 of 9 (22.2%) camels from the farm of a patient in Jeddah, KSA [50], [51], and from 3 of the 14 tested dromedary camels in Qatar [59]. More than one genomic variant was found in dromedary camels which is different from humans where one variant exist and thus the finding suggests interspecies transmission of MERS-CoV of specific genotypes [66]. Currently, the route of animal-to-human transmission is not clearly known [67]. However, MERS-CoV was found in camel milk in 41.7% of 12 tested camel milk [68].",

In 2012 with the emergence of MERS-CoV, the Saudi Ministry of Health, based on available data at that time and in accordance with the WHO advice, did not recommend any travel restrictions [77], [78]. The Saudi MoH recommendations also promoted the use of good hand hygiene and cough etiquette [78]. On October 10\u201331, 2012, the 2012 annual Hajj season was uneventful with no reported MERS-CoV cases among four million pilgrims [79]. Among 300 symptomatic pilgrims with upper respiratory symptoms, none of them tested positive for MERS-CoV [80]. In a cohort of 154 French pilgrims, 83.4% had respiratory symptoms, but none was tested positive for MERS-CoV [81]. A number of sporadic cases and cluster of MERS-CoV occurred in 2012 and 2013 in Saudi Arabia as discussed earlier with clear evidence of human to human transmission among close contacts. As the season for the 2013 Hajj approached, the Saudi MoH further strengthened the recommendations based on the available data. The recommendations stated that people 65 years and older, and those with chronic diseases (such as: heart disease, kidney disease, respiratory disease and diabetes) and pilgrims with immune deficiency (congenital and acquired), malignant and terminal illnesses, pregnant women and children aged under 12 years should postpone the performance of the Hajj and Umrah [74].",

The basis of such screening to reduce the potential risks of international spread of infectious disease was controversial [87], [88], [89], [90], [91]. In an analysis of the effectiveness of non-contact infrared thermometers (NCIT), the calculated positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.9\u201376.0% and negative predictive value (NPV) was 86.1\u201399.7% based on fever prevalence of 1.2\u201316.9% [87]. In a small study of airline travellers, 3 (0.8%) of 359 met the influenza-like illness case definition [89]. Pitman et al. [90] concluded that \u201centry screening is unlikely to be effective in preventing the importation of either SARS or influenza\u201d. Identifying a maximum of 9% of SARS infected individuals has no significant impact on the course of any subsequent SARS epidemic [90]. In Canada, the use of thermal scanning to detect fever, only 191 (0.025%) of 763,082 screened persons had an initial temperature of >38 \u00b0C [91]. The estimated cost of such screening was Can$7.55 million in 4 months [91].",
