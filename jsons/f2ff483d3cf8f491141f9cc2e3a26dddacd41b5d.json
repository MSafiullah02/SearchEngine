Rapid detection and differentiation from seasonal influenza is essential to instigate appropriate patient and public health management and for disease surveillance. Objectives: To develop a rapid and sensitive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) for confirmation of H1N1 swl. Study design: A one-step rtRT-PCR approach was employed to target the matrix gene of the novel influenza A/H1N1 swl and validated against a panel of seasonal influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), swine influenza A/H1N1 and avian influenza A/H5N1 viruses. The assay following validation was then used prospectively to detect H1N1 swl positive specimens from the recent outbreaks in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Results: The one-step H1N1 swl matrix rtRT-PCR successfully detected H1N1 swl clinical specimens and did not cross-react with seasonal influenza A, subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and swine influenza A (H1N1). The H1N1 swl matrix assay did cross react with H5N1. The H1N1 swl matrix assay was then compared to two other assays using a dilution series and a panel of untyped influenza A positive clinical samples. These experiments found the assay to have a comparable sensitivity to the established universal influenza A rtRT-PCR and was more sensitive than the H1N1 swl specific assay that targeted the H1 region. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that the rtRT-PCR is sensitive and should be used alongside existing universal influenza A assays to rapidly detect the novel H1N1 swl virus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "On April 15th and 17th 2009, a novel swine-lineage influenza A (H1N1 swl) infection was reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta in two children presenting with febrile respiratory illness from adjacent counties in southern California. 1,2 These cases were not epidemiologically linked and neither child had exposure to swine. 2 Subsequent phylogenetic characterisation of H1N1 swl from the U.S. index case (A/California/04/2009) showed that the virus had a unique genome composition that had not been previously identified. Six genes (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP and NS) were similar to viruses previously identified in triple-reassortant swine influenza viruses in North American pigs. 2 The remaining two genes (NA and M) were derived from Eurasian swine influenza viruses and this particular gene constellation has never been previously identified in humans or other reservoirs. 2 Since the original identification of H1N1 swl in the U.S. and Mexico, sustained human to human transmission has been seen in other countries raising concerns of a future pandemic. [3] [4] [5] The symptoms seen in U.S. and cases outside of Mexico resemble those normally seen in influenza, with fever, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, headache and myaglia, however, approximately 25% of patients had vomiting or diarrhea, which is unusually high compared with infections with other strains of influenza. 2 The H1N1 Table 1 Primer and probes sequences for the generic influenza A and the H1N1 swl rtRT-PCR assays.

Most influenza A PCR assays in use in the United Kingdom target conserved regions of the M gene and therefore should detect influenza A from all established subtypes, including the newly emergent H1N1 swl.

Other studies have also highlighted its non-specificity in relation to avian strains of influenza A7. However, since avian influenza A viruses are not circulating in humans in the UK at present the non-specificity of this assay should not pose a particular problem for its routine use and any samples that have a high risk of being avian influenza positive should also be tested using a H5N1 real-time assay in order to rule out this virus.
