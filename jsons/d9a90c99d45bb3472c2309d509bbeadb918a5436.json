In addition, 42% of patients in the intensive care unit require invasive mechanical ventilation, necessitating sedation and foley catheter insertion. 3 Inpatient urologic consultations are very common, 26% of which will result in bedside procedures. 4 In the first few weeks of the current outbreak, roughly 20-25% of urologic consults at our institution have been for patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2, although this percentage may change over time. Bedside procedures performed for these patients have included: difficult Foley placement, bedside cystoscopy, suprapubic tube exchanges, incision and drainage of scrotal and perineal abscesses, and gross hematuria with clot retention. As the number of patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 continues to increase, we anticipate growth in urologic consults and bedside procedures for infected patients.",

The rest should be left outside to avoid unnecessary contamination. A second person, a nurse or colleague familiar with the supplies, should be enlisted to help and remain outside the room. To remain in contact with the primary provider, the provider may require a hands-free headset or speakerphone within the room to facilitate easy communication. This assistant can pass additional supplies into the room as needed or obtain other instruments from other treatment areas. To keep the patient's door closed as much as possible, we recommend the assistant transfer additional supplies under the door or through a crack in the door onto a small table in the patient's room, avoiding direct handoff to the contaminated provider. It also reduces excessive donning and doffing of PPE, expedites the procedure, and decreases time in the patient's room. Once the procedure is complete, contaminated supplies should be disposed of in the patient's room.",

We also leave a glide wire and council-tip catheter outside the room in case the first two attempts at catheter placement are unsuccessful. It is also useful to have irrigation supplies available, including saline and a catheter-tipped syringe. If these maneuvers are unsuccessful, we proceed to bedside cystoscopy.

However, we cannot bring the entire cart into the room of a patient with SARS-CoV-2 due to the risk of contamination of the entire cart and its supplies. We have instead created makeshift carts with only a single light source, light cord, flexible cystoscope, saline bag, and irrigation tubing. This makeshift cart with a single guide wire and council-tip catheter are brought into the patient's room while other types of wires, catheters, and dilators are left outside as backup. A portable monitor is also highly recommended, both to reduce the risk of possible facial contamination with body fluids during direct visualization to improve the difficulties of visualization through an eyepiece when wearing appropriate eye/face protection. After the procedure is complete, the cystoscope is cleaned per institutional protocol, placed inside a biohazard bag, and sent to sterile processing. The entire cart and light source are sanitized once inside the room and then additionally outside the patient's room.",

We have a low threshold to then initiate continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) to reduce the need for manual irrigations and prevent unnecessary exposures for nursing staff. It is important to initially irrigate out as much clot burden as possible to prevent possible clot obstruction of the catheter. To allow for easier monitoring and titration of continuous irrigation flow from a distance, it is important to set up the irrigation fluid, tubing, and catheter bag to be easily visible. We recommend ensuring that adequate gravity drainage is present throughout the system and securing all tubes to prevent migration or kinking to avoid the need for difficult troubleshooting after the procedure. For men, we also routinely inflate the retention balloon to 30 cc with light catheter traction for a limited period. If these patients need an endoscopic fulguration procedure, spinal anesthesia may reduce the amount of aerosolization.",
