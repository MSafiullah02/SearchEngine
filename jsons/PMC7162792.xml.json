This mussel is reported to live in the region ranging from intertidal to shallow subtidal zones at the depth of approximately 30 m, and it is tolerant of low salinity and low oxygen levels during its life span of ca. two years (http://www.exoticsguide.org/musculista_senhousia). The outside shell of M. senhousei is smooth and shiny with a yellow-green color and can grow to a maximum length of 35 mm, while its interior is purplish-gray. Analyses of the habitat and growth conditions indicate that M. senhousei is a passive filter-feeding shellfish. Thus, in addition to a small number of protozoa, the main component of its food is diatoms, which belong to 20 different genera [2].",

In our continuous search for anti-influenza A viral compounds from natural sources [4], [5], [6] using the H5N1 pseudo-typed virus screening approach, we identified the traditional Chinese seafood M. senhousei as showing a good inhibitory activity toward influenza A virus (IAV). The preliminary mechanistic study indicated that the antiviral activity of this food resulted from the inhibition of virus entry during early infection. We then investigated the bioactive components of this mussel using a bioassay-guided approach, from which a porphyrin derivative named pyropheophorbide a (PPa) that showed significant anti-IAV activity in vitro was isolated and identified, indicating a potential application of this molecule in the development of new antiviral agents.",

Currently, only two types of anti-IAV drugs are available, but the emergence of viral strains resistant to these compounds has been reported [26], in addition to some side effects. Therefore, it is imperative to develop new and effective anti-IAV drugs that employ a different mechanism by targeting other viral proteins or cellular factors involved in the influenza virus life cycle. In this study, we identified a porphyrin derivative, pyropheophorbide a (PPa), with broad anti-IAV activity in vitro. PPa was isolated from the marine mussel M. senhousei, and it has also been isolated from abalone [27]. Structurally, PPa is a derivative of chlorophyll. Therefore, a reasonable deduction that the original sources of PPa might be phytoplankton, which were subsequently transformed by mussels to produce PPa\n[28].",

Polykaryons are indicated by red arrowheads. 4b The results were quantified by counting the number of polykaryons. Syncytium formation was quantified by counting the number of polykaryons in whole fields of the plate. Each of the polykaryons contains at less three nuclei. The polykaryon inhibition was compared to the pH 5.0 control.4c Lipids were extracted from MDCK cells, mixed with PBS to form a suspension, and then PPa was added to a final concentration of 5 \u03bcg/mL. The mixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 45 min, the supernatant was removed, and the lipids were washed with PBS twice. The bound PPa was then extracted with 1 mL of methanol for 1 h, and the fluorescence intensity was measured at the excitation wavelength of 365 nm. 4d Lipids were suspended in PBS at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, and then PPa was added at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcg/mL. After an incubation for 2 h, the fluorescence intensity was measured at the excitation wavelength of 365 nm. 4e The thermodynamic curve of the binding of 75 \u03bcg/mL PPa to 1 mg/mL of lipids was obtained by performing an ITC assay. The thermal changes occurring in response to the interactions between PPa and cellular lipids were detected.

The mice were intranasally challenged twice with 106 TCID50 of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) in a volume of 30 \u00b5L of normal saline (NS). Immediately after the viral infection, the mice were orally administered PPa or oseltamivir. The compounds were administered once a day until the fifth day. The mortality rates were analyzed with Pearson\u2019s Chi-square test (P < 0.05). 5b Lung index of infected mice treated with PPa. The lung index of the mice was determined after the viral infection and PPa treatment for 3 days. Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001. 5c The body weight of the infected mice was recorded. 6d Histopathological changes (200 \u00d7 ) of the lung tissues obtained from mice.",
