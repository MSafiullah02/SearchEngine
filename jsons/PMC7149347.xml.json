            "text": "Traditionally, core quantitative approaches used in pharmacy practice research include nonexperiments, quasi-experimental designs, and true experimental designs such as prospective randomized controlled intervention trials. Nonexperiments also include observational study designs that are often described as pharmacoepidemiologic study designs such as case\u2013control study, cohort study, nested case\u2013control study, and cross-sectional study (Etminan, 2004, Etminan and Samii, 2004). In recent years, conventional qualitative approaches and their philosophical paradigms are increasingly been used in pharmacy. These include the five qualitative approaches to inquiry: narrative research, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, and case study. These qualitative methods are often difficult for pharmacy practice researchers to comprehend, and researchers tend to describe the methods of data collection such as individual interviews and focus group discussions as qualitative methods of inquiry. These data collection methods are briefly described later in this chapter, among others. Furthermore, there is an increasing importance on the appropriate selection and use of mixed method approach (Hadi et al., 2013; Hadi and Closs, 2016a, Hadi and Closs, 2016b), which are often designed and applied wrongly. Finally, it is worthwhile to be familiar with novel research methodologies such as discrete choice experiments, Delphi techniques, simulated client technique, and nominal group techniques, which fall between quantitative and qualitative approaches, often with no clear differentiation on where they belong. Although called \u201cnovel\u201d in the context of this chapter, these methods are not new in other relevant disciplines, but new and not commonly used in pharmacy practice research.",

            "text": "Pharmacy practice researchers begin by conception of a research idea or identifying a research question and defining a hypothesis based on the question. The researcher then selects a study design that will be suitable to answer the research question. The study design should be appropriately selected prior to initiation of any research investigation. Selecting an inappropriate study design may potentially undermine the validity of a study in its entirety. Investigators are encouraged to critically think about the possible study designs to ensure that the research question is adequately addressed and should be able to adequately justify their choice. These study designs have been variously classified and one common classification system is quantitative vs. qualitative study designs. Study designs play a major role in determining the scientific value of research studies. Inappropriate choice of a study design is impossible to correct after completion of the study. Therefore, thorough planning is required to avoid unconvincing results and invalid conclusions. Good understanding of basic study design concepts will aid researchers in conducting robust and rigorous practice-based research. This chapter introduces the structure and the fundamentals of common study designs used in pharmacy practice research and discusses the important considerations for conducting pharmacy practice research in terms of study design, data collection, data analyses, and ethical considerations.",

            "text": "Various classifications for research designs and methods used in pharmacy practice have been used in the literature. The following are some of the approaches for the classification of research designs:1.Classification based on time orientation: Retrospective vs. prospective designs\na.Retrospective design\u2014A retrospective study design observes what has happened in the past. It begins and ends in the present. This design involves a major limitation as it looks to collect information about events that occurred in the past. An example of this design is retrospective case-control study.\nCase example: Investigators were looking for the association between acute myocardial infarction and smoking status, type of tobacco, amount of smoke, etc. (Teo et al., 2006). Another example of a case\u2013control study from published literature is the study investigating the association between the use of phenylpropanolamine and the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (Kernan et al., 2000).b.Prospective design\u2014A prospective study design begins in the present and progresses forward, collecting data from subjects whose outcomes lie in the future. An example of this design is prospective cohort study.\nCase example: Investigators were interested to determine the long-term effectiveness of influenza vaccines in elderly people; they recruited cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated community-dwelling elderly (Nichol et al., 2007).\n2.Classification based on study purpose: Descriptive vs. analytical designsa.Descriptive design\u2014A descriptive study describes a population/sample in terms of distribution of the variables, and frequency of outcomes of interest. Unlike analytical studies that include control (comparison) group, descriptive studies do not include a comparison group. Descriptive studies include case reports, case series reports, cross-sectional studies, surveillance studies, and ecological studies.\nCase example: A case report was written by a physician who contracted Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) during an outbreak in Hong Kong (Wu and Sung, 2003). Another example is an ecological study examining diet and sunlight as risks for prostate cancer mortality (Colli and Colli, 2006). Chim et al. conducted a large population-based survey in Australia to determine what community members think about the factors that do and should influence government spending on prescribed medicines (Chim et al., 2017).b.Analytical design\u2014An analytical study identifies risk factors, associated factors, mediating factors, etc. Analytical studies are either experimental or observational. Case\u2013control and cohort studies are types of observational studies.\nCase example: A group of investigators carried out a study to establish an association between the use of traditional eye medicines (TEM) and corneal ulcers. In this case, both case\u2013control and cohort study designs are applicable. In an example of a case control study, Archibugi et al. aimed to investigate the association between aspirin and statin exclusive and combined and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma occurrence (Archibugi et al., 2017). Another example of a cohort study is a study carried out by Wei et al. in which they investigated whether or not acid-suppression medicines increased the risk of bacterial gastroenteritis (Wei et al., 2017).\n3.Classification based on investigator orientation: Experimental vs. quasi-experimental vs. observational designsa.Experimental design\u2014In experimental design (also known as interventional design), the investigator performs an intervention and evaluates cause and effect relationships.\nCase examples: Investigators conducted a study about the newer versus older antihypertensive agents in African hypertensive patients (NOAAH) trial (nct01030458) to compare the efficacy of single-pill combinations of newer versus older antihypertensive agents (i.e., a single-pill combination of newer drugs, not involving a diuretic, with a combination of older drugs including a diuretic) (Odili et al., 2012). In a crossover design, a group of investigators evaluated the effect of spironolactone on nonresolving central serous chorioretinopathy (Bousquet et al., 2015).b.Quasi-experimental design\u2014The quasi-experimental design is very similar to the true experimental design described above and it involves an intervention. The design has been employed when randomization is inappropriate or impossible, especially when implementing complex interventions.\nCase examples: Prashanth et al. aimed to understand if (and how) a package of interventions targeting primary health centers and community participation platforms affect utilization and access to generic medicines for people with noncommunicable diseases using quasi-experimental design approach (Prashanth et al., 2016).c.Observational design\u2014It involves only observation of natural phenomena and does not involve investigator intervention. Typically, this study design investigates associations and not causation. Examples include cohort study and case\u2013control study. These studies can explore an association between a pharmacologic agent and a disease of interest. Case examples: Please see previous examples of these.\n4.Classification based on question orientation: Quantitative vs. qualitative vs. mixed method designsa.Quantitative design\u2014This is based on measurement of quantity and it is applicable to phenomenon that can be quantified (i.e., expressed in terms of numbers).\nCase examples: Please see experimental studies, and case\u2013control and cohort study designs.b.Qualitative design\u2014Qualitative research is concerned with qualitative phenomenon (i.e., a phenomenon relating to or involving quality).\nCase examples: Investigators in Canada explored the lived experiences of youth who are prescribed antipsychotics by conducting interpretative phenomenology study (Murphy et al., 2015).\nc.Mixed method designs\u2014Mixed method design brings together qualitative and quantitative methodologies within a single study to answer or understand a research problem (Hadi et al., 2013).\nCase examples: Shiyanbola et al. combined focus group discussion with a survey tool to investigate patients' perceived value and use of quality measures in evaluating and choosing community pharmacies (Shiyanbola and Mort, 2015).\n5.Classification of pharmacoepidemiologic study designsBelow is a brief description of traditional and novel pharmacoepidemiologic study designs. Several examples of pharmacoepidemiologic study designs are provided above. Some descriptive studies including case reports, case series, and ecological studies will not be described in this chapter.a.Case\u2013control studies\u2014In this design, patients (those who develop the disease or outcome of interest) are identified and control patients (those who do not develop the disease or outcome of interest) are sampled at random from the original cohort that gives rise to the cases (Etminan and Samii, 2004, Newman et al., 2013). The distribution of exposure to certain risk factors between the cases and the controls is then explored, and an odds ratio (OR) is calculated.b.Cohort studies\u2014This can be described as a study in which a group of exposed subjects and a group of unexposed subjects are followed over time and the incidence of the disease or outcome of interest in the exposed group is compared with that in the unexposed group (Etminan and Samii, 2004, Hulley et al., 2013).c.Case-crossover studies\u2014The case-crossover may be considered comparable to a crossover randomized controlled trial in which the patients act as their own control (Etminan and Samii, 2004). Pattern of exposure among the cases is compared between event time and control time. The between-patient confounding that occurs in a classic case-control study is circumvented in this design. Tubiana et al. evaluated the role of antibiotic prophylaxis and assessed the relation between invasive dental procedures and oral streptococcal infective endocarditis, using a nationwide population-based cohort and a case-crossover study design (Tubiana et al., 2017).d.Case\u2013time control studies\u2014This design is an extension of the case-crossover design, but includes a control group (Etminan and Samii, 2004). A group of researchers assessed medication-related hospitalization. They used the case\u2013time control study design to investigate the associations between 12 high risk medication categories (e.g., antidiabetic agents, diuretics, benzodiazepine hypnotics) and unplanned hospitalizations (Lin et al., 2017).e.Nested case\u2013control studies\u2014In this design, a cohort of individuals is followed during certain time periods until a certain outcome is reached and the analysis is conducted as a case\u2013control study in which cases are matched to only a sample of control subjects (Etminan, 2004). de Jong et al. examined the association between interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) and potential adverse events using population-based health administrative data in Canada (De Jong et al., 2017).f.Cross-sectional studies\u2014In this type of study, the investigator measures the outcome of interest and the exposures among the study participants at the same time (Hulley et al., 2013, Setia, 2016b). It provides a snapshot of a situation for a particular period.\n\n",

It is a useful design to study exposures in rare diseases or diseases that take long time to develop (Newman et al., 2013). It investigates exposures in individuals with and those without the outcome of interest. Nevertheless, case\u2013control studies can help to identify harmful or beneficial exposures. Furthermore, the outcome of interest can be undesirable (e.g., mortality) or desirable (e.g., microbiological cure). As the name suggests, in a case\u2013control study design, there are two groups of subjects: (1) cases (individuals with the outcome of interest) and (2) controls (individuals without the outcome of interest) (Newman et al., 2013). Cases are randomly selected based on prespecified eligibility criteria from a population of interest. Appropriate representative controls for the cases selected are then identified. The researchers then retrospectively investigate possible exposures to the risk factor. Fig. 1\nrepresents a schematic diagram of a case\u2013control study.",

It can be considered equivalent to a crossover RCT with a washout period (Etminan and Samii, 2004). Pattern of exposure to the risk factor is compared between the event time and the control time (Etminan and Samii, 2004). Case-crossover study design is useful to investigate triggers within an individual. For instance, it is applicable when studying a transient exposure or risk factor. However, determination of the period of the control and case components is a crucial and challenging aspect of a case-crossover study design. Since the patients serve as their own controls, the interindividual variability that is inherent in classic case\u2013control studies is eliminated.

The investigator randomly assigns a representative sample of the study population into an experimental group and a control group (Fig. 4). Randomization in RCT is to minimize confounding and selection bias; it enables attainment of similar experimental and control groups, thereby isolating the effect of the intervention. The experimental group receives the treatment or intervention (e.g., a new drug or pharmaceutical care for treatment of a certain disease), while the control group receives a placebo treatment, no treatment, or usual care treatment depending on the objective of the study (Cummings et al., 2013). These groups are then followed prospectively over time to observe the outcomes of interest that are hypothesized to be affected by the treatment or intervention. The result of the study is considered to have high internal validity if significant changes on the outcome variable occur in the experimental group, but not the control group. The investigator can infer that the treatment or intervention is the most probable cause of the changes observed in the intervention group. The unit of randomization in RCTs is usually the patient, but can sometimes be clusters to circumvent the drawbacks of contamination.",

Whenever true experimental models are not feasible to be applied in pharmacy practice research, the researcher should endeavor to use a more robust quasi-experimental design. For instance, when randomization is not feasible, the researcher can choose from a range of quasi-experimental designs that are non-randomized and often noncontrolled (Grady et al., 2013, Krass, 2016). Quasi-experimental studies used in pharmacy literature may be classified into five major categories: (1) quasi-experimental design without control groups (i.e., one group pre\u2013posttest design); (2) quasi-experimental design that use control groups with no pretest; (3) quasi-experimental design that use control groups and pretests (i.e., nonequivalent control group design with dependent pretests and posttests) (see Fig. 5); (4) interrupted time series and; (5) stepped wedge designs (Brown and Lilford, 2006, Grady et al., 2013, Harris et al., 2006).",

The five approaches to qualitative research inquiry are:a.Narrative research: Describes participants' written and spoken stories about their experiences with a phenomenon being investigated, while considering the chronological connection of the phenomenon's series of events (Anderson and Kirkpatrick, 2016, Creswell, 2013, Czarniawska, 2004).b.Phenomenological research: Describes the essence of participants' common experiences of a phenomenon, so that the description is a general essence rather than an individual experience (Creswell, 2013, Giorgi, 1997, Moustakas, 1994).\nc.Grounded theory research: Aims to generate a theory grounded in participants' data that conceptually explain a social phenomenon, which could involve social processes, or actions or interactions (Creswell, 2013, Strauss and Corbin, 1990, Woods et al., 2016).d.Ethnographic research: Involves describing the shared patterns of values, behaviors, and beliefs of culture-sharing participants (Creswell, 2013, Harris, 1968, Rosenfeld et al., 2017).e.Case study research: Provides an in-depth examination of a real-life contemporary phenomenon that researchers cannot change over time, to illustrate the significance of another general topic (Baker, 2011, Creswell, 2013, de Le\u00f3n-Casta\u00f1eda et al., 2018, Mukhalalati, 2016, Yin, 2014).\n",

They are developed based on the literature review, aim and objectives, research questions, and propositions (Kleiber, 2004).b.Audio recording of FGs and interviews: Audio recording of discussions that take place in interviews and FGs is essential for managing and analyzing data, and for increasing the accuracy of data collection and analysis, and ultimately enhancing the dependability and credibility of the research (Rosenthal, 2016, Tuckett, 2005).c.Transcription of FGs and interviews recording: Verbatim transcription refers to the word-for-word conversion of oral words from an audio-recorded format into a scripted text format. Transcribing data is considered as the first data reduction step because it generates texts that can be examined and rechecked (Miles et al., 2014, Grossoehme, 2014).\n3.Data analysisData analysis comprises several fundamental steps, including reading the transcribed text, arranging data, coding data deductively based on prefigured themes or inductively to produce emergent themes, and then summarizing the codes into themes, and finally presenting the analyzed data as results (Cohen et al., 2013, Crabtree and Miller, 1999, Pope et al., 2000).The most commonly used data analysis methods in health science research are:a.Thematic analysisThematic analysis is characterized by identifying, analyzing, and reporting themes that are available in the data (Braun and Clarke, 2006, Castleberry and Nolen, 2018).b.Content analysisContent analysis comprises systematic coding followed by quantification of the analyzed data in a logical and unbiased way (Berelson, 1952, Vaismoradi et al., 2013).c.Discourse analysisDiscourse analysis emphasizes the core format and the structure of texts to examine the assumptions and concealed aspirations behind discourses (Brown and Yule, 1983, Gee, 2004).\n\n",

In pharmacy practice research, Hadi and Closs, 2016a, Hadi and Closs, 2016b argued that quality in qualitative research topic has not been discussed widely in the literature, and therefore Hadi and Closs, 2016a, Hadi and Closs, 2016b suggested using several trustworthiness criteria to ensure the rigor of qualitative study. The trustworthiness criteria for ensuring quality in qualitative research (Lincoln and Guba, 1985) are:1.The trustworthiness criteriaa.CredibilityThis criterion aims to ensure that the results are true and increases the possibility that the conclusions are credible (Cohen and Crabtree, 2008).\nb.DependabilityThis criterion aims to indicate that the research results are repeatable and consistent, in order to support the conclusions of the research (Cohen and Crabtree, 2008).c.ConfirmabilityThis criterion aims to confirm the neutrality in interpretation by ensuring that the perspectives of participants, not the bias of researchers, influence the results (Krefting, 1991).d.TransferabilityThis criterion involves identifying the contexts to which the study results can be generalized, and indicating if the study conclusions can be applied in similar setting (Yin, 2014).\n2.Reflexivity in qualitative researchReflexivity implies revealing and evaluating the effect and biases that researchers can possibly bring to research process, by explaining the researcher's opinion, feelings, and experience with the phenomenon in question, and explaining the influence of this experience on research methods, findings, and write-ups (Creswell, 2013, Krefting, 1991, Lincoln and Guba, 1985).\n",

            "text": "Obtaining an ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) is required before conducting the qualitative research (Creswell, 2013). The key ethical issues that need to be considered are:a.Informed consent and participant information leafletInformed consent refers to the decision taken by a competent individual to voluntarily participate in a research, after adequately understanding the research. Participant information leaflet is usually distributed to participants before they consent to participate in the research to clarify them the voluntary nature of research participation, the aim and objectives of the research, the rights of the respondents and the potential risks and harms, the data collection, management and storage conditions, and the right of participants to withdraw from the research (Jefford and Moore, 2008).b.Anonymity and confidentialityThe anonymity is usually ensured by not disclosing names of participants and by utilizing a code system to identify them during data collection, management, analysis, and in the writing up of the research. The confidentiality of participants and data is ensured by using a code system to identify participants, and by storing all data in a locked cabinet and a password-protected computer for a specified period of time (Creswell, 2013).c.Power relations in qualitative research settingsPower imbalance is caused by the fact that participants have the experience about the investigated phenomenon, and researchers need to obtain information about these experiences. The power imbalance is usually associated with interaction between the researcher and participants during recruitment stage, and during data collection, analysis, interpretation, and validation stages. Hence, researchers should take suitable measures at each stage to decrease the influence of possible power imbalance, and should enhance trust with participants (Karnieli-Miller et al., 2009, Yardley, 2000).\n",

            "text": "Research studies in pharmacy practice usually utilize single-method research designs. However, often these report numerous limitations and may not adequately answer the research question. Therefore, the combination of more than one research method to answer certain research questions has become increasingly common in pharmacy practice research (Ryan et al., 2015). Mixed methods research design is now a popular and widely used research paradigm in pharmacy practice research fields (Hadi et al., 2013, Hadi et al., 2014; Hadi and Closs, 2016a, Hadi and Closs, 2016b, Ryan et al., 2015). Mixed methods research allows the expansion of the scope of research to offset the weaknesses of using either quantitative or qualitative approach alone (Creswell et al., 2004, Hadi et al., 2013; Hadi and Closs, 2016a, Hadi and Closs, 2016b, Pluye and Hong, 2014). Typically, qualitative and quantitative data are collected concurrently or sequentially in order to increase the validity and the comprehensiveness of the study findings (Creswell et al., 2004, Hadi et al., 2013; Hadi and Closs, 2016a, Hadi and Closs, 2016b, Pluye and Hong, 2014, Ryan et al., 2015). The mixed method approach provides an expanded understanding of phenomenon under investigation through the comparison between qualitative and quantitative data (Hadi et al., 2013; Hadi and Closs, 2016a, Hadi and Closs, 2016b, Pluye and Hong, 2014).",

The most common typologies used in pharmacy practice and health services research include: concurrent or convergent parallel design, exploratory sequential design, explanatory sequential design, and the embedded design (Hadi et al., 2013, Pluye and Hong, 2014). Scholars believe that there are several factors to consider when selecting the typology or model of mixed methods research to use. These factors include: the order of qualitative and quantitative data collection (concurrent vs. sequential); priority of data (i.e., which type of data has priority between quantitative and qualitative data); purpose of integration of the data (e.g., triangulation); and number of data strands (Hadi et al., 2013, Pluye and Hong, 2014). In mixed methods research, integration of qualitative and quantitative findings is critical, and this research approach does not simply involve the collection of these data (Ryan et al., 2015).",

            "text": "\nPharmacy practice researchThe Canadian Pharmacists Association defines pharmacy practice research as a component of health services research that focuses on the assessment and evaluation of pharmacy practice (Koshman and Blais, 2011).Quantitative researchIs simply defined as \u201ca research in which things are counted.\u201d These things might be people, medicines, opinions, behaviors, etc. \u201cWhile qualitative research is very useful for describing phenomena in depth (particularly motivations, feelings, understandings), quantitative research can tell us how common and widespread the phenomena are\u201d (Green and Norris, 2015).Qualitative researchQualitative research within the health sciences has developed as a means to gather an in-depth understanding of human behavior, as well as to find the underlying reasons, attitudes, and motivations that govern such behavior (Kaae and Traulsen, 2015).Mixed methods researchA mixed methods research typically involves both the components of qualitative and quantitative research approaches embedded within a single study or research program for the broad purpose of breadth and depth of understanding and corroboration (Creswell et al., 2004, Johnson et al., 2007, Tashakkori and Creswell, 2007).Observational studiesObservational studies involve merely observing the study subjects in a noncontrolled setting, without investigator intervention or manipulating other aspects of the study in order to determine an association between an exposure and an outcome of interest.\nExperimental studiesIn experimental design (also known as interventional design), the investigator performs an intervention and evaluates cause and effect relationships between exposure to the intervention and an outcome of interest (Cummings et al., 2013). Subjects are typically randomly assigned into experimental and control groups.Quasi-experimental studiesQuasi-experimental designs are studies that aim to evaluate interventions, but that do not use randomization and at times noncontrolled (Harris et al., 2006, Krass, 2016). Similar to true experimental studies, quasi-experiments aim to determine causality between an intervention and an outcome of interest.\n",
