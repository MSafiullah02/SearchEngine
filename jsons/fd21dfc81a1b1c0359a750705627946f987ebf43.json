MBL deficiency is due to one of three point mutations in the gene for MBL, each of which reduces levels of the lectin by interfering with the protein oligomerization [351] . In children with this kind of deficiency, the level of MBL is 4.9 mg/l compared to the 143 mg/l in controls [487] . Regardless of whether the children are homozygote (HZ) or heterozygote (HET) in relation to a given mutation, the defect appears to be more consistent in small babies aged 6-18 months [487] , who show an immaturity in providing immune response to capsular bacteria and in whom low levels of opsonin are incapable of compensating for this [506] . The risk of contracting infections is similar in HZs [175] and HETs [486] , though it persists throughout life in HZs because of an abnormal allele, while it exhausts itself in the HETs, where the frequency of abnormality is similar to that of the general population [175] . Anomalies in immunoglobulins (Ig) and in opsonization have been observed, respectively in 13%-20% of children suffering from frequent asthma and IgG subclass deficiencies. Children suffering from cystic fibrosis also present an elevated prevalence of immediate cutaneous reactions to aeroallergens, and although without primary defects of adoptive immunity, they are susceptible to severe RRIs; therefore it may be possible that they suffer from the mucosal antigenic exclusion [61] . Unlike asthmatic children, in whom a relatively high concentration of IgE for respiratory viruses was observed [172, 173, 457] , positive skin prick tests (SPTs) are more common for Aspergillus fumigatus [61] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 63, "end": 68, "text": "[506]", "ref_id": "BIBREF502"}, {"start": 237, "end": 242, "text": "[351]", "ref_id": "BIBREF327"}, {"start": 353, "end": 358, "text": "[487]", "ref_id": "BIBREF464"}, {"start": 545, "end": 550, "text": "[487]", "ref_id": "BIBREF464"}, {"start": 699, "end": 704, "text": "[506]", "ref_id": "BIBREF502"}, {"start": 760, "end": 765, "text": "[175]", "ref_id": "BIBREF173"}, {"start": 775, "end": 780, "text": "[486]", "ref_id": "BIBREF463"}, {"start": 974, "end": 979, "text": "[175]", "ref_id": "BIBREF173"}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1464, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1578, "end": 1583, "text": "[172,", "ref_id": "BIBREF170"}, {"start": 1584, "end": 1588, "text": "173,", "ref_id": "BIBREF171"}, {"start": 1589, "end": 1593, "text": "457]", "ref_id": "BIBREF453"}, {"start": 1671, "end": 1675, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The hypothesis suggested by these observations is that atopy derives from an unbalanced immune response to foreign antigens, with a consequent lack of their early identification or the capacity to neutralize or eliminate them.

The association of very low IgA levels with atopy has been proposed again in the classic prospective study on the association of viral respiratory infections (VRI) and the onset of allergic manifestations, which proved serum IgA levels at the lowest normal levels in the children studied [173] .

The publication of the first case of agammaglobulinemia by Bruton in 1952 [60] demonstrated that the PID diagnosis is first done in the laboratory. However, PIDs require specialized immunological centers for diagnosis and management [33] . A large body of epidemiological evidence supports the hypothesis of the existence of a close etiopathogenetic relation between PID and atopy [73] . In particular, an elevated frequency of asthma, food allergy (FA), atopic dermatitis and enteric pathologies can be found in various PIDs.

Various acquisitions indicate that PID is also an opsonization deficiency, observed in 5% of the normal population [469] . In this disease, microorganism phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes appears annulled, and the patient is subject to severe infections supported by capsular bacteria: the deficiency, described in association with severe and recurrent infantile infections [175, 485, 487] , depends on the lack of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) [487] , its Primary Immunodeficiencies a possible atopy dependence on IgA underproduction rather than on IgE hyperproduction ( Fig. 4.1 ): in children with levels of IgA at the minimum normal level, and followed from birth until the age of 18-23 months, a greater severity of atopic manifestations and an increased cumulative incidence of asthma, AD and otitis media with effusion (OME) were observed compared to controls.

This hypothesis is supported by the observation that Omenn syndrome, WAS and especially HIgES, with an immunological phenotype characterized by a quantitative and qualitative reduction of CD8 T cells, are accompanied by extremely high levels of serum IgE [61, 162, 196] . Lymphocytes in subjects with normal levels of IgE are incapable of producing them, not even after stimulation with polyclonal activators such as PWM (pokeweed mitogen) or EBV (Epstein-Barr virus), while patients with high antibody levels spontaneously synthesize in culture sIgE (specific) levels between 200 and 2,000 pg/ml, also releasing factors capable of increasing IgE secretion (IgE-PF) [287] . Supernatant derivatives from the T cells of patients with HIgES are in fact capable of inducing in vitro the pre-B cells to increase IgE production; furthermore, when the T lymphocytes in these patients are isolated on the basis of receptors for the IgE Fc fragment, the remaining cells release IgE-PF [287] . Considering the suppressive activity of human lymphocytes with CD8 phenotype on sIgE, it has been observed that these lymphocytes are able to suppress sIgE synthesis in patients with high antibody levels; similarly CD8 + cells from a bone marrow transplant (BMT) can suppress IgE production in the HLA-compatible recipient [478] . The study of patients with ID associated with hyper-IgE has supplied useful information concerning IgE system biology, although the immune defect essentially responsible for IgE increased production and for severe atopic iectasia (ATA), thymic alymphoplasia, SCID (severe combined ID) (48%) [44] and, occasionally, by DiGeorge syndrome (DGS), ID with hyper-IgM (HIgMS) now CD154/CD40L deficiency, selective IgM deficiency, biotin-dependent carboxylase deficiency, CGD (chronic granulomatous disease), primary neutropenia, and in Netherton, Nezelof, Omenn and Shwachman syndromes [434] .

This was possible thanks to the refinement of DNA recombinant technology (rDNA), including DNA probes (sequences of radio-marked DNA) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The closer the gene segregates to RFLP, the lower the chance that they might be separated by recombination phenomena when meiosis occurs: the identification of deficient genes allows early diagnosis, even prenatal, and if necessary gene therapy or BMTs [76] . Furthermore, the observation that numerous PIDs are transmitted with an X-linked modality allows a relatively simple diagnosis of males with a positive family history (FH); if FH is negative (40%-50% of XLA cases) or there are females presenting a clinical pattern of PID, or when sporadic cases are caused by a new mutation, carrier identification is based on the study of immunologically normal female carriers, with two populations of B precursors, using X-chromosome inactivation analysis. This test does not take into account the existence of possible gene mutations and the availability of already affected relatives, and it is also relatively simple and fast [537] . Molecular studies follow the hypothesis that, at an early stage during embryogenesis, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated in the cells of all tissues of female embryos (persisting as Barr's chromatin) [300] . Therefore in normal conditions, one has a cell mosaic that actively expresses for 50% the paternal X chromosome and for the remaining 50% the maternal X chromosome (lionization) [300] (Fig. 22 .3a) [355] . In female carriers of XLA, the cell mosaic expresses 50% for an X chromosome with Btk in an active form and the remaining 50% for an X with a mutated Btk (Bruton tyrosine kinase). This means that in the carrier mother it is inactivated in preference to the X chromosome carrier of the defective gene in B, which matures therefore in an unbalanced manner (not randomly), while in all other cells activation occurs randomly. It follows that in fixed carriers only the B lymphocytes that have the X carrier of a normal gene complete the differentiating route, while the precursors that express the X chromosome with a mutated Btk do not mature into B cells, but remain blocked [100, 413] (Fig. 22.3b) . In X-SCID, the study of fixed carriers follows the corrected Lyon hypothesis, because the cells with a normal active X develop into normal T lymphocytes; however, when T precursors with a mutant X reach the stage where the X is needed, they do not find it and consequently do not develop: thus female carriers have only one normal and active X, instead of the random mixture of cells with one of the two active X [389] .

Classically affected subjects present levels of IgG at <100 mg/dl, with very low circulating IgA, IgM and B cells (Table 22. 3), in which are found, in addition to BM, pre-B lymphocytes in an almost normal quantity [100] . XLA is characterized by a blocking of B-cell differentiation that results in an arrest of the evolution of pre-B1a cells: low levels of cytoplasmic IgM and high levels of surrogate light (L) chains (CD179b) into later-stage B cells [348] .The B-cell differentiation arrest in the majority of XLA patients appears to be homogeneous, with approximately 80% of the pro B-cell compartment being negative for cytoplasmic Igm expression [349] . The size and nature of the residual more mature B-cell population (leakiness) varied among patients, independent of the type of Btk mutation. Further, it appears that the pro B-cell compartment composition in bone marrow (BM) of some XLA patients can be influenced by low levels of wild-type Btk mRNA [349] . On the contrary, T cells are normal both in function and in number, as is thymus architecture, including Hassall's corpuscles and thymus-dependent areas of spleen and lymph nodes. B lymphocyte zones are typically depleted, with an absence of GCs, plasma cells, and cortical and medullar differentiation compared to normal (Figs. 22.4 and 22.5) and an absence of adenoidal tissue (Fig. 22.6 ). The intestinal lamina shows a similar deficiency [227] , even if both B and T cells use the same recombination (Chap. 1). In the BM, increased pre-B lymphocytes without CD19 and CD21 can be observed. The pre-B cells are capable of transcribing and translating microgram intracytoplasmic (IC) H chains, but not the L chains [453] , thus pre-B only form microgram chains not associated with V H , while only 5% of normal cells produce incomplete chains [278] . Experimental data currently indicate that the defect lies in the XLA gene mutations that codify for btk [505, 513] . The XLA gene is expressed by B cells during differentiation, but is not transcribed in the T cells, thereby explaining the B lymphocyte maturative block at the pre-B level [61] (Fig. 2.6 ), immediately after their appearance in the BM [302] . XLA, however, presents a genetic heterogeneity, explained by mutations in the 5 btk domain (PH, TH, SH3, SH2, kinase), with a frequency proportional to the pertinent domain dimensions [514] . The mutation size was ascertained by finding 175 mutations in 236 patients ( Fig. 22.7) . Equally, genes codifying for marker proteins and receptors that are essential for B-cell maturation and development are also involved: in fact many of these proteins, including btk, Hm chains and surface proteins are crucial for B-cell differentiation [395] . Studying chil-dren of both sexes with XLA, various mutations of Hm germline have been identified, in addition to deletions affecting the D, J H and Cm genes and other gene alterations capable of blocking H chain synthesis on B lymphocytes [548] . An equivalent molecular defect was observed in an infant girl with XLA, with differentiation block preceding the Ig gene rearrangements by early pre-B cells [316] . There are also the so-called leaky forms, with absent or few B cells and various antibody deficiencies [240] , which can be attributed to individual mutations of btk [267] , for example in the non-kinase domain, which permits the expression of normal btk levels [427] . However, btk mutations can be even more detrimental for B lymphocyte proliferation compared to the total kinase absence [370] . XLA is clinically characterized from its onset in male babies, at 5-6 months of life (but also at the end of the 1st year), when the maternal IgG passive protection ceases. It usually attracts attention due to delayed growth and mostly recurrent and severe bacterial infections dominate (sinusitis, otitis, bronchitis, [476] . Although representing the phenotypic picture of humoral ID, confirmed as a separate deficiency [459] , XLA associated with GHD is mapped in the same region as the X chromosome of the isolated XLA.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 130, "end": 135, "text": "[100]", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 353, "end": 358, "text": "[100]", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 593, "end": 598, "text": "[348]", "ref_id": "BIBREF324"}, {"start": 792, "end": 797, "text": "[349]", "ref_id": "BIBREF325"}, {"start": 1101, "end": 1106, "text": "[349]", "ref_id": "BIBREF325"}, {"start": 1438, "end": 1452, "text": "22.4 and 22.5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1551, "end": 1556, "text": "[227]", "ref_id": "BIBREF225"}, {"start": 1825, "end": 1830, "text": "[453]", "ref_id": "BIBREF449"}, {"start": 1953, "end": 1958, "text": "[278]", "ref_id": "BIBREF257"}, {"start": 2065, "end": 2070, "text": "[505,", "ref_id": "BIBREF501"}, {"start": 2071, "end": 2075, "text": "513]", "ref_id": "BIBREF509"}, {"start": 2250, "end": 2254, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2313, "end": 2318, "text": "[302]", "ref_id": "BIBREF299"}, {"start": 2505, "end": 2510, "text": "[514]", "ref_id": "BIBREF510"}, {"start": 2855, "end": 2860, "text": "[395]", "ref_id": "BIBREF410"}, {"start": 3102, "end": 3107, "text": "[548]", "ref_id": "BIBREF537"}, {"start": 3267, "end": 3272, "text": "[316]", "ref_id": "BIBREF313"}, {"start": 3378, "end": 3383, "text": "[240]", "ref_id": "BIBREF237"}, {"start": 3441, "end": 3446, "text": "[267]", "ref_id": "BIBREF246"}, {"start": 3537, "end": 3542, "text": "[427]", "ref_id": "BIBREF405"}, {"start": 3665, "end": 3670, "text": "[370]", "ref_id": "BIBREF366"}, {"start": 3992, "end": 3997, "text": "[476]", "ref_id": "BIBREF491"}, {"start": 4095, "end": 4100, "text": "[459]", "ref_id": "BIBREF455"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 252, "end": 262, "text": "(Table 22.", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1488, "end": 1498, "text": "(Fig. 22.6", "ref_id": "FIGREF11"}, {"start": 2255, "end": 2264, "text": "(Fig. 2.6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2590, "end": 2600, "text": "Fig. 22.7)", "ref_id": "FIGREF11"}], "section": "X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia or Bruton Tyrosine Kinase Deficiency"}, {"text": "The observation of HZ deletion of one or more C H genes for the H chains of Ig in 5%-10% of normal patients has led to the identification of various polygenic deletions concerning the genes of one or more isotypes and subclasses [282, 414] .

In one family the molecular bases of the deficiency were ascribable to two different punctiform mutations, one in each C\u03ba allele that prevented the formation of -S-S bridges between the k and H chains. The k:l ratio in human Ig is 2:1, and the relative alterations can be observed in numerous primary or secondary IDs [414] . Only one patient is known with an l chain deficiency, hgG and RRI (upper and lower respiratory tract) [508] . [61, 79, 302] . Rotavirus and ECHO viruses also cause severe meningoencephalitis in 5%-15% of patients [100] . Phenotypic variability may occasionally be present, as in a family spanning three generations [332] . In 33 patients with a median age of 9.4 years the median age at the XLA onset was 8 months and the median age of diagnosis was 4 years, with a median diagnosis delay of 33 months. The common infectious diseases were pneumonia, otitis, diarrhea, sinusitis, and arthritis. The most common chronic infections were seen in 75.8% of the patients: in the respiratory tract in 93.9%, in the gastrointestinal tract in 75.8%, in the central nervous system (CNS) in 33.3%, and in the musculoskeletal system in 21.2% of patients [324] . Bronchiectasis, malabsorption, arthritis, autoimmune and tumor-related diseases are the most common complications, as well as edema, contractures, etc. (Fig. 22 .8). One must predict the onset of bronchiectasis and intervene quickly with specific physiotherapy, because forms that are initially localized later spread, causing respiratory failure in older children and adolescents. One-third of all cases start with mono-or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum with a sterile exudate, which usually regresses following treatment with IVIg [355] .Anti-polio vaccinations with live attenuated viruses should be forbidden, because they can cause very severe pneumonia [278] . About ten cases of XLA associated with GHD are known. In addition to reduced growth, clinical symptoms are typical of XLA, though it is not a variant, Sporadic cases have been described, occasionally associated with SIgAD (10%-20%) and more often with ATA (80%) and susceptibility to infections [227] or without RRIs [385] , differentiating patients with probable PID from those with low levels of IgG 2 (Table 22 .7) [387] , in whom it may represent delayed maturation [450] . Selective deficiency of IgG subclasses presents three different aspects: \u2211 Total lack of a subclass \u2211 Two SD levels below average \u2211 Inability to produce antibodies relative to the subclass in question, even when hematic concentrations are normal [465] The following selective deficiencies are present [283, 465] : \u2211 Isolated IgG 1 : deficiency in only a few cases has been described, also because this subclass represents 60%-70% of all IgGs (the others account for 25% [IgG 2 ], 6% [IgG 3 ] and 3% [IgG 4 ]), its absence is very probably an indication of an evident HgG; these patients usually have a reduced level of total IgGs and react normally to antigens with a polysaccharide capsule. \u2211 Other combined ID (CID): for example IgG 2 +IgG 4 , IgG 2 +IgG 3 , IgG 1 +IgG 2 +IgG 4 , IgG 1 +IgG 2 , IgG 2 +IgG 3 + IgG 4 , some of which are associated with a deficiency of IgA or its subclasses [153, 465] . The association of SIgAD and defects of IgG subclasses is explainable in view of Ig production ontogenesis by B cells: one starts with IgM, moving on to IgD, and then to IgG ending up with IgA passing by IgE [296] ; therefore the deficiency could originate with an immunological defect involving the T lymphocyte regulating work or B cells secreting Ig, with an effect on the final stages of their production. In rare cases, more or less extended deletions in chromosome 14 have been observed, in the region that codifies the H chains; in most cases the genome is instead intact, confirming a possible defect in B lymphocyte switching [367] .

Interesting indications for understanding the pathogenesis come from molecular genetic studies that have allowed the formulation of a hypothesis of multifactorial origin, given that the combinations of more widely involved HLA haplotypes and extended haplotypes involve the class I-III genes, to the extent that they are more often encountered in the general population [105] .Among the class III alleles the most studied is the gene that dictates the C4A, among class I and II the most common are A1, A28, B8, B13, B40, CW6, DR1, DR3, DR7, DQW1, associated with haplotypes such as A1, B8, DR3; B13, DR7; A1, B14 or A28, B14.

CVID can also be observed following congenital rubella or EBV infections; it can also be induced by some drugs such as phenytoin [355] . In 2/9 CVID families, 5 subjects were identified with identical large mutations in the ICOS (inducible costimulator) gene, expressed on the surface role in the formation of a barrier against the penetration of polypeptidic macromolecules through the intestinal mucosa. SIgAD therefore facilitates the penetration of food antigens through the mucosa followed by the formation of specific antibodies. For example, 50% of patients present CICs and precipitins to CM, 23% to bovine anti-serum and 13% to anti-serum of calf fetus [106] . Symptoms affecting the respiratory tract are also caused by the absence of sIgA, as in 30/36 children aged 1-15 with increased susceptibility to RRIs [327] . Patients balance the sIgA deficiency with the sIgM, but in some cases the compensation is insufficient for exempting them from RRIs and asthma [227] . SIgAD should be diagnosed on the basis of both serum and secretory IgA, because normal levels in adults are achieved at different times (Table 1. 15) . Some drugs such as phenytoin (an anticonvulsant) can determine SIgAD, sometimes persisting in time after the drug has been discontinued. The clinical symptoms in these cases are not different from those of patients with SIgAD [507] . There is no random treatment; these patients do not benefit from therapy with IVIg, even when enriched in IgA. There are no counter-indications for obligatory and optional vaccinations [507] . Whole blood or plasma transfusions containing IgA can sensitize patients or cause anaphylactic shock in those already sensitized [105] . Life expectancy is excellent; however, the random discovery of SIgAD in asymptomatic children should not be underestimated. They should in fact undergo periodic clinical and laboratory controls so as to identify as early as possible any possible pertinent symptoms. At the same time, there is the need to ensure a good life quality with adequate prevention of RRIs in those patients whose respiratory tract is affected [383] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 321, "end": 326, "text": "[232]", "ref_id": "BIBREF229"}, {"start": 471, "end": 476, "text": "[191]", "ref_id": "BIBREF207"}, {"start": 540, "end": 545, "text": "[527]", "ref_id": "BIBREF523"}, {"start": 588, "end": 593, "text": "[232]", "ref_id": "BIBREF229"}, {"start": 725, "end": 730, "text": "[355]", "ref_id": "BIBREF351"}, {"start": 1258, "end": 1263, "text": "[106]", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1421, "text": "[327]", "ref_id": "BIBREF340"}, {"start": 1567, "end": 1572, "text": "[227]", "ref_id": "BIBREF225"}, {"start": 1953, "end": 1958, "text": "[507]", "ref_id": "BIBREF503"}, {"start": 2146, "end": 2151, "text": "[507]", "ref_id": "BIBREF503"}, {"start": 2283, "end": 2288, "text": "[105]", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 2710, "end": 2715, "text": "[383]", "ref_id": "BIBREF379"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1711, "end": 1720, "text": "(Table 1.", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Common Variable ID"}, {"text": "SADNI translates into the inability to respond to certain antigens, especially if polysaccharide.

The most accredited hypothesis is that a number of extended haplotypes of the HLA system are shared, to which gene duplications, deletions and polymorphisms codifying for some class II and III alleles correspond [22] . In fact, a number of common HLA haplotypes, especially belonging to class III, are observed in patients, and at least two haplotypes in 77% of cases [518] , such as HLA-DQB1*0201, HLA-DR3, C4B-Sf, C4A, G11-15, Bf-0.4, C2a, HSP-70-7.5, TNFa-5, HLA-B8 and HLA-A1, postulating therefore the existence of a common genetic basis [22] , with a susceptible gene (6p21.3) possibly the association marker [61] . For example in five members of a large family with one of the two PIDs, duplications of the C4 genes were associated with a selected group of HLA class II and III genes [22] . The fact that four members without PID also had these haplotypes indicates that their presence alone is not sufficient for expressing PID, leaving room therefore for other factors [22] such as overlapping relations with celiac disease.

Walker et al have calculated that the prevalence of THI is 23 \u00d7 10 6 in children, equal to the prevalence of symptomatic SIgAD (24 \u00d7 10 6 ) [525] . In all 15 children the IgG and in 12/15 (80%) the IgA were <5th percentile, 9/15 (60%) had IgM levels <20th percentile resolved around the 22nd month; further confirmation consisted in the fact that the 12 children had symptoms either of AD or of FA or food intolerance [525] . From Table 22 .4 the mean incidence is from 1 to 61 \u00d7 10 6 . During 7 years 30 children aged 6-46 months were diagnosed with THI and an incidence of 4.3/year [124] .

The molecular base is the mutation affecting the JAK3, which prevents it from associating with the gc chain and from sending signals to the abovementioned ILs [354] and to other marker proteins belonging to the JAK-Stat complex [301] .

The cousins and their parents harbored both wild and mutant alleles. This partial deficiency is sufficient to block T-cell development and lead to a SCID phenotype. The FH of severe PID with multiple affected male infants strongly suggested an X-linked inheritance. Nevertheless, this family consanguinity is in favor of an AR inheritance [410] . Defective IL 7 R expression caused in three patients a T -B + NK + SCID, indicating that the T-cell defect in SCID-X1 resulted from inactivation of IL 7 Ra signaling.

It has a frequency of 1% in cases of SCID [68] . The children are symptomatic in 90% of cases within the first days after birth [46] and is usually fatal within the 3rd month of life without a BMT [224] . Due to the common stem cell (SC) non-maturation [224] , it is characterized by total block in lymphoid and myeloid precursor differentiation, therefore not only by an extraordinary lymphopenia, but also by a marked cytopenia in all sections (Table 22 .11) [474] , in the spleen, in the lymph nodes and in the gastroenteric tract, and a high frequency of severe successive infections [474] . The thymus is always much reduced in volume, no Hassall's bodies are seen [224] . Seven of the eight infants reported by WHO with this defect died between 3 and 119 days of age from overwhelming infections; the eighth underwent complete immunological reconstitution from a BMT [543] . An additional three of five children who required two HSCTs (hematopoietic SCT stem-cell transplantation) and received intensive conditioning therapy before haploidentical HSCT (matched for 3 of the 6 HLA loci) are alive and well an activated phenotype and poor functional capacity [117] . Studies involving HLA typification and DNA polymorphism show that T cells belong to the host, ruling out, therefore, the etiology of maternal cell engraftment [117] , unlike other types of SCID [474] . The absence of circulating B is also characteristic [117] , equal to 3.8%-7.1% of normal levels [474] , reaching 0% [520] , high IgE levels (526 UI/l), hypereosinophilia reaching 3,000\u00a510 9 cells/l (normal, 0-0.5 cells/l), and low Ig levels at the beginning [246] then declining to the point of agammaglobulinemia [520] , comparable to that in reticular digenesis (Table 22 .11) [474] . The marked B-cell depletion can also bear RAG1 and RAG2 gene missense mutations that decrease the efficiency of VDJ recombination, which results in impaired but not absent rearrangement of both BcR and TcR. Four missense mutations were detected in the RAG-2 in 6/8 patients [491] . In 13/16 patients (81%) the mutations affected the RAG1 gene, and in 3/16 (19%) the RAG2 gene [515] . Increased IgE is linked to Th2 primary infiltration, with spontaneous production of IL 2 IFN-g, IL 4 , IL 5 and IL 10 , which is down-regulated by IFN-g therapy [437] . Clonal expansion of Vb14 + CD3 + , CD4 -CD8secreting high IL 5 levels and low IL 4 and IFN-g levels [318] could indicate an analogy with the Fas (CD95) defect. T lymphocytes show an activated phenotype and a spontaneous apoptosis associated with reduced expression of bcl-2 gene product, and a higher cell death of CD4 + CD45R0 + cells [59] . Given that high CD30 levels in the lymph nodes, skin and serum of three children generated Th2 lymphocytes [95] , a Th2-mediated pathogenesis is possible: the CD30 are Th2 markers (Chap. 1). As in human SCID, B and T cells are found in mice with SCID, but with a final repertoire that is decidedly oligoclonal and lacks the heterogeneity characteristic of a normal immune system, so lymphopenic SCID and Omenn syndrome could be two aspects of the same disease with different clinical expressions, especially of time [224] . Clinically, young babies soon after birth show a generalized exudative erythroderma and desquamation, often mistaken as AD, alopecia, widespread lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, persistent and profuse diarrhea, failure to thrive with malnutrition ( Fig. 22.19) , AIHA, recurrent infections caused by common and opportunistic germs ( Fig. 22 .20), and markedly elevated serum IgE levels [136, 241, 474, 520] . This outline included four babies from the same family with the same symptoms until death occurred at 10-19 months, but who did not present hypereosinophilia and were diagnosed as DM [375] . Differential diagnosis may be challenging since Omenn syndrome and GvHD show dyskeratosis and basal vacuolation, but the first always shows acanthosis and usually parakeratosis. GvHD shows a flat epidermis and rarely parakeratosis. Both can be distinguished after immunohistochemical staining for CD45 and CD68, which shows predominantly lymphocytes in the dermal infiltrate in Omenn syndrome, and relatively more macrophages in GvHD [438] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 251, "end": 255, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 337, "end": 341, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 406, "end": 411, "text": "[224]", "ref_id": "BIBREF222"}, {"start": 462, "end": 467, "text": "[224]", "ref_id": "BIBREF222"}, {"start": 670, "end": 675, "text": "[474]", "ref_id": "BIBREF489"}, {"start": 797, "end": 802, "text": "[474]", "ref_id": "BIBREF489"}, {"start": 879, "end": 884, "text": "[224]", "ref_id": "BIBREF222"}, {"start": 1082, "end": 1087, "text": "[543]", "ref_id": "BIBREF546"}, {"start": 1372, "end": 1377, "text": "[117]", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 1539, "end": 1544, "text": "[117]", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 1574, "end": 1579, "text": "[474]", "ref_id": "BIBREF489"}, {"start": 1634, "end": 1639, "text": "[117]", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 1678, "end": 1683, "text": "[474]", "ref_id": "BIBREF489"}, {"start": 1698, "end": 1703, "text": "[520]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1840, "end": 1845, "text": "[246]", "ref_id": "BIBREF243"}, {"start": 1896, "end": 1901, "text": "[520]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1961, "end": 1966, "text": "[474]", "ref_id": "BIBREF489"}, {"start": 2243, "end": 2248, "text": "[491]", "ref_id": "BIBREF468"}, {"start": 2345, "end": 2350, "text": "[515]", "ref_id": "BIBREF511"}, {"start": 2514, "end": 2519, "text": "[437]", "ref_id": "BIBREF433"}, {"start": 2622, "end": 2627, "text": "[318]", "ref_id": "BIBREF331"}, {"start": 2858, "end": 2862, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2972, "end": 2976, "text": "[95]", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 3381, "end": 3386, "text": "[224]", "ref_id": "BIBREF222"}, {"start": 3779, "end": 3784, "text": "[136,", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 3785, "end": 3789, "text": "241,", "ref_id": "BIBREF238"}, {"start": 3790, "end": 3794, "text": "474,", "ref_id": "BIBREF489"}, {"start": 3795, "end": 3799, "text": "520]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3985, "end": 3990, "text": "[375]", "ref_id": "BIBREF371"}, {"start": 4427, "end": 4432, "text": "[438]", "ref_id": "BIBREF434"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 655, "end": 664, "text": "(Table 22", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1946, "end": 1955, "text": "(Table 22", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 3642, "end": 3653, "text": "Fig. 22.19)", "ref_id": "FIGREF11"}, {"start": 3726, "end": 3733, "text": "Fig. 22", "ref_id": "FIGREF11"}], "section": "Reticular Dysgenesis"}, {"text": "with myeloid and T-and B-cell lymphoid reconstitution [46] ; another child is alive and well after 32 months [13] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 54, "end": 58, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 109, "end": 113, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Reticular Dysgenesis"}, {"text": "B-SCID, characterized by increased cell sensitivity to radiation secondary to mutations of the ARTEMIS gene, could carry a poorer prognosis because of defective repair of DNA breaks [406] , occurring around the time of BMT, from the effects of chemotherapy, infections, and GvHD [206, 247, 332] .

He was given a successful allogeneic BMT after cytoreduction [452] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 110, "end": 115, "text": "[414]", "ref_id": "BIBREF392"}, {"start": 903, "end": 908, "text": "[452]", "ref_id": "BIBREF448"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "IL 2 Deficiency (IL 2 Ra-Chain Gene Mutations)"}, {"text": "About 225 cases have been reported, [75, 290, 539] , 78% [75] or 100% [539] of which have the X-linked form of CD154 deficiency [75] . Patients are generally male, but there can be a non-X-linked form [224] , in which 22% of patients are females [75] . An estimated minimal incidence was calculated of 1 in 1,030,000 live births. Over half of 79 patients developed ID symptoms and were diagnosed by 1 year of age, and over 90% by 4 years of age [539] .Although carriers of XHIgMS are considered to be asymptomatic, an extreme lyonization of the normal X can lead to a mild expression of the XHIgMS which is similar to CVID [118] . It can be secondarily caused by environmental factors and also stem from congenital rubella [278] : this indicates its heterogeneity. Mutations in the TNFRSF5 encoding CD154 in XHIgM patients result in a lack of B-cell signaling by activated T cells [53] . However, 21 boys out of 56 failed to express CD154, and TNFRSF5 mutations were found in 20 of these boys, whereas no TNFRSF5 mutations were found in 16 boys with weak expression of CD154 [184] . As a result, XMIgM B cells fail to undergo isotype switching and produce only IgM due to a defect in the RNA editing enzyme, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA), an enzyme expressed only in B cells and required for the processes of class-switching and somatic hypermutation of Ig genes [357] . The marked reduction of IgG (<150 mg/dl), IgE and IgA is accompanied by a sharp increase in mature IgM and circulating IgD, but B cells do not express other Ig [227] . Interestingly, 25% of patients with confirmed XHIgMS who had TNFRSF5 mutations had low concentrations of IgG, IgA, and IgM. Most of the remaining patients with XHIgMS had the classic pattern of normal or raised IgM with low concentrations of IgA and IgG [184] . The CD154 gene defect is usually expressed on the membrane by activated T lymphocytes, which therefore cannot bind B-cell CD40 [266, 346] . Figure 22 .21 shows 75 CD154 localizations and mutation frequencies, in 39.5% of cases mistakenly. For example, a sense codon substitutes for a missense one, creates a premature stop signal: therefore specific pertinent mutations, such as G144E, tunistic infections. This disorder is related to mutations in the gene that encodes the nuclear factor kB (NF-kB), which is required for activation of the transcription factor NF-kB, or NEMO (NF-kB essential modifier), also known as IKK (inhibitor of B kinase). The phenotype observed in X-HIgMS-EDA patients shows that the putative zinc-finger domain of NEMO has a regulatory function and demonstrates the definite requirement of CD40-mediated NF-kB activation for B cell Ig classswitching [233] . Three other genes, expressed by B cells, have been associated with the HIGM phenotype giving place to HIGM 2-4. Mutations of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA) (HIGM2) and uracil glycosylase (UNG) (HIGM4), both expressed by follicular B lymphocytes, lead to defective class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation. Mutations of CD40, the CD154 receptor, cause a rare autosomal form with a clinical phenotype similar to CD154 deficiency (HIGM3). These rare PIDs may shed light on the complex events leading to the production of high-affinity, antigen-specific antibodies of different isotypes [146, 355] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 36, "end": 40, "text": "[75,", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 41, "end": 45, "text": "290,", "ref_id": "BIBREF287"}, {"start": 46, "end": 50, "text": "539]", "ref_id": "BIBREF542"}, {"start": 57, "end": 61, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 70, "end": 75, "text": "[539]", "ref_id": "BIBREF542"}, {"start": 128, "end": 132, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 201, "end": 206, "text": "[224]", "ref_id": "BIBREF222"}, {"start": 246, "end": 250, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 445, "end": 450, "text": "[539]", "ref_id": "BIBREF542"}, {"start": 623, "end": 628, "text": "[118]", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 723, "end": 728, "text": "[278]", "ref_id": "BIBREF257"}, {"start": 881, "end": 885, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1075, "end": 1080, "text": "[184]", "ref_id": "BIBREF200"}, {"start": 1379, "end": 1384, "text": "[357]", "ref_id": "BIBREF353"}, {"start": 1547, "end": 1552, "text": "[227]", "ref_id": "BIBREF225"}, {"start": 1809, "end": 1814, "text": "[184]", "ref_id": "BIBREF200"}, {"start": 1944, "end": 1949, "text": "[266,", "ref_id": "BIBREF245"}, {"start": 1950, "end": 1954, "text": "346]", "ref_id": "BIBREF322"}, {"start": 2694, "end": 2699, "text": "[233]", "ref_id": "BIBREF230"}, {"start": 3312, "end": 3317, "text": "[146,", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 3318, "end": 3322, "text": "355]", "ref_id": "BIBREF351"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1957, "end": 1966, "text": "Figure 22", "ref_id": "FIGREF11"}], "section": "X-Linked Hyper-IgM (or Hyper-IgD) or CD154 Deficiency Syndrome (XHIgMS)"}, {"text": "Early treatment with IVIg associated with antibiotic prophylaxis have reduced the incidence of life-threatening infections and improved the growth of children with HIgMS [290] .

Patients have considerably reduced concentrations of serum and urinary uric acid.

HLA class II molecules are absent in all tissues [400] , to the extent that the cells of patients maintained in cultures for years preserve the negative phenotype [400] . There is a deficiency of class II gene transactivator (CIITA) codified by chromosome 15, the expression of which plays an important role in T-cell activation: its absence makes class II gene expression impossible [473] . This function is shared with another protein mapped on chromosome 2, RFX5, with a binding site in the promoter region of genes codifying class II chains [401] . Two additional class II-specific transcription factors are RFXAP and RFXANK [314] . These act on the class II promoter region and are essential and also nonreplaceable, to the extent that alternative routes cannot compensate for their absence [311] . Furthermore inactivation, or the deficiency of these factors, has a specific effect on the genes dictating HLA class II, the li chain and HLA-DM, because there is no indication that other regulating systems may be involved [401] .

CDC42H2 plays a critical role in the assembly of actin filaments [490] and in T-cell polarization when they encounter a B-lymphocyte APC [481] .

The proliferative response to mitogens can be pathologically reduced [224] and the response to polysaccharide antigens may be absent [442] .

Linkage to a region on chromosome 4q has been demonstrated in several affected families; however, neither the fundamental host defect nor the defective gene has yet been identified [195] . FH is frequently positive for atopic disease, at times HIgES is combined with an unusual predisposition to Staphylococcus aureus infections [62, 178, 196, 287] . In Buckley's study, it was present in 36.4% of cases, of both sexes, indicating an autosomal dominant transmission with incomplete penetrance [62] . Onset occurs in the pediatric age in 90% of cases [64] . Clinical presentation is unusual: there are no complaints during the first months of life, toward the 3rd-4th month a severe form of chronic AD appears all over the body, which can be associated with other allergic manifestations, including asthma in 13.6% of cases [62] . Skin biopsy specimens reveal spongiosis and perivascular dermatitis and/or folliculitis with a predominance of eosinophils [91] . There is an excessive predisposition to cutaneous and respiratory tract infections (deep and superficial abscesses, otitis, pneumonia, sepsis) ( Fig. 22 .37), also encouraged by neutrophil chemotactic deficiency caused by defective cellular functions (Table 1. 65), which, if present, is so pronounced that it becomes a characteristic, unlike AD where it is secondary [226] . The subcutaneous abscesses, described as cold, not covered by warm and reddened skin, are pathognomonic to HIgES but not essential to the diagnosis [144] . The abscess is filled with pus that always grows Staphylococcus aureus; in some cases mucocutaneous candidosis and chronic herpetic keratitis are associated [178] . Infections appear within the first 18 months [62] . The face shows coarse and dysmorphic features, midline facial defects such as a prominent nose and a high, arched palate, and disproportionate cheekbones and mandible; pondostatural growth notably retarded [64] , pneumatocele (Fig. 22 .38) and osteoporosis caused by reduced bone density with a tendency to fracture [287] complete the picture.

Considering the IFN-g/IL 4 + correlation of AD, in HIgES no specific T-cell anomalies are noted, nor does the hyper-IgE explain this pediatric abnormal susceptibility to infections: high IgE levels are also seen in children with AD, who do not, however, have an unusual predisposition to abscess formation [226] . One typical characteristic is sIgE directed against microbial antigens: the anti-staphylococcal sIgE rise to 8.9% compared to normal levels of 0.2%-0.6%. Another constant finding is the increase in 100% of cases of eosinophil concentrations, which make up 6%-12% of leukocytes [64] , reaching 30%-50% [178] .

In case of HIgES caused by FA, atopic manifestations can clearly improve following an exclusion diet, reducing the frequency of infections and partially correcting the immune defect [420] , revealing how FA can induce several immunological anomalies. Diagnosis is made on the basis of the data in Table 22 .14; differential diagnosis with AD is schematized in Table 22 .15 [287] . Treatment with cromolyn is extremely effective, anti-staphylococcal antibiotic treatment [64, 226] and if necessary antifungal therapy provide good results [144] . Griscelli disease, mapping to chromosome 15q21 [372] , is an AR syndrome caused by mutations in the MYO5A (GS1), RAB27A (GS2), or MLPH (GS3) genes, all of which lead to a similar pigmentary dilution [50, 312] . The disease is also characterized by partial oculocutaneous albinism, predisposition to pyogenic infections and in most patients by abnormal regulation of the immune system, which results in a syndrome of macrophage hyperactivation, known as hemophagocytic lymophohistiocytosis [15] . Mutations in the GTP-binding protein RAB27A (GS2), which appears to be involved in an uncontrolled T lymphocyte and macrophage activation syndrome, leading to death in absence of BMT, occur in this syndrome [319] . A mutation was found in the MYO5A gene (GS1) associated primarily with neurological impairment [319] . Two identical twin boys aged 3 months were reported with persisting fever, mouth ulcers, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia and failure to thrive [431] , as was an 8-month-old infant [397] . Both infants had silvery-gray hair and pigment clumps on the hair shafts, and skin biopsy showed accumulation of melanocytes on melanosomes. Their parents were first cousins and a sibling with similar manifestations had already died, as did the twins. A genetic study revealed a 5-bp deletion in the RAB27A gene (510 del AAGCC in exon 5) [431] . In a 4-year-old child with hemophagocytic syndrome, ID, and secondary neurological disorders, typical melanosome accumulation was found in skin melanocytes and pigment clumps were observed in hair shafts. Two heterozygous mutant alleles of the RAB27A gene, a C-T transition (C352T) leading to Q118stop and a G-C transversion on the exon 5 splicing donor site (G467+1C) were found [50] .

More precisely, the four subtypes are caused by mutations in the four gp91 phox regions, many of which depend on CYBB gene mutations, causing the X91 0 form, while 17 mutations depend on the NADPHoxidase activity (X91form) and eight others lead to a 1309 Phagocyte Deficiency subunits, which are in part mediated by noncovalent binding between src-homology 3 domains (SH3 domains) and proline-rich motifs [447] . CGD is a hereditary disease (Table 22 .16) characterized by severe recurrent pyogenic infections. This marked susceptibility is caused by the phagocytes' incapacity to kill in particular the catalase-positive bacteria, because of a genetic defect of the NADPH-oxidase enzymatic system situated in the wall of the phagocytic vacuole. In CGD, phagocytosis occurs normally, but the NADPH-oxidase is unable to markedly produce anion superoxide (O 2 \u2022-), H 2 O 2 and other O 2 free radicals, thereby permitting the survival of microorganisms within the cells, where they are protected from the antibodies and from most antibiotics [501] . Another consequence of the lack of O 2 radicals is the development with countless inflammatory episodes, which then result in typical granulomas [109] . The nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction test is based on the chemical characteristics: in fact, the phagocytes without O 2 \u2022are unable to reduce the yellow NBT of products activated by PHA aspecifically stimulated phagocyte O 2 , or specifically with corpuscle particles such as preopsonized yeasts (Fig. 22.41) .

She also has two half-sisters who are completely well. The FH is negative for recurrent infections in either parent or more distant relatives [121] . LAD type V caused by Rac2 deficiency. A 5-week-old boy born to unrelated parents had delayed UC separation, perirectal abscesses, poor wound healing, and absent pus at sites of infection in the setting of neutrophilia, suggesting a neutrophil defect. His neutrophils exhibited decreased chemotaxis, polarization, azurophilic granule secretion, as well as significantly reduced stimulated superoxide production but had normal expression and up-regulation of CD11b. Rac2 constitutes more than 96% of the Rac in neutrophils [9] . A 1-yearold boy who had multiple recurrent, life-threatening infections characterized by leukocytosis and notable for the absence of pus in the inflamed tissues was reported. The presence and density of CD11b, CD11c, and CD18 were normal. The expression of CD62P and CD62L were also normal. A BMT was curative. The boy shared a phenotype that closely mimicked that of a mouse mutant deficient in the Rho GTPase, Rac2 [534] . The disease was shown to be attributable to an AD mutation in the Rho GTPase Rac2 at an amino acid needed for proper interaction with other intracellular proteins. Rac2 comprises >96% of the critically important G protein Rac in neutrophils.

The 400 G6PD variants have been classified by the level of residual enzyme activity and propensity for hemolysis and grouped into five classes: class I, severely deficient with chronic hemolytic anemia; class II, severely deficient with occasional hemolytic anemia (<10% residual activity); class III, moderately deficient (10%-60% residual activity); class IV, normal activity (60%-150%); class V, increased activity [310] .

AR transmitted, it appears far more common than previously suspected (1:2,000 for the partial deficiency to 1:4,000 for the total deficiency). It is a disorder that is prevalently recorded in entirely healthy patients and therefore, in most cases, a random laboratory finding. In addition to three already-known mutations, the genetic characterization of an Italian population showed the presence of six novel mutations: four missense mutations, a deletion of an adenine within exon 3 (c.325delA) and a mutation within the 3\u00a2 splice site of intron 11 (c.2031-2A>C). The c.325delA deletion causes a shift in the reading frame with the occurrence of a premature stop codon within the pro-peptide. The activation of a cryptic 3\u00a2 splice site located 109nt upstream of the authentic 3\u00a2 splice site causes a shift in the reading frame that may lead to the generation of an abnormal MPO precursor lacking the enzymatic activity [303] .

Recently, mutations of the gene encoding neutrophil elastase 2 (ELA2) have been indicated as the most common cause for SCN as well as the cause for autosomal dominant cyclic neutropenia [225] . Deficiency of ELA2 leads to regularly fluctuating levels of neutrophils [112] . Linkage analysis on 13 affected pedigrees have shown that cyclic neutropenia and sporadic cases of this disease are due to a mutation in the gene for ELA2, located at 19p13.3 [112] . This enzyme is synthesized in neutrophil precursors early in the process of primary granule formation [225] . A mutation in the ELA2 gene was detected in one of three apparently autosomal dominant kindreds with familial SCN. No mutations were identified in the apparently AR families [12] . These results fit those showing that mutations were found in all five SCN families [112] , but they suggest that not all cases of autosomal dominant SCN caused by mutations in ELA2 [12] . However, the high frequency of HET mutations in the neutrophil elastase gene in sporadic SCN confirms a previous report [112] . Considering that four novel mutations and a low-frequency polymorphism were detected, nearly all cases of sporadic SCN may result from de novo HET mutations in ELA2 [12] . In recurrent SCN, an absolute neutrophil count of <200 cells/mm 3 (or <0.1\u00a510 9 /l) [12] oscillates with an approximate 21-day periodicity. Circulating neutrophils vary between almost normal numbers and zero [225] . In about 30% of patients with cyclic neutropenia, however, the cycles range from 14 to 36 days [42] . In 26 children referred during a 22-year period PIDs were as follows: cyclic neutropenia (30.7%), Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (26.9%), Kostmann syndrome (23%), and Ch\u00e9diak-Higashi syndrome (19.2%). The mean absolute neutrophil count of children was 398.2\u00b1259.3 cells/mm (range, 74-1,152/mm) at the first visit. The children first experienced symptoms of infection suggesting neutropenia at a median age of 7.5 months (range 1 month to 10 years), also suffering from oral ulcer, otitis, pneumonia, diarrhea, cutaneous abscess, and oral candidiasis [398] . Fever, stomatitis, and periodontitis and skin infections occur during periods when the neutrophil count is low. significantly diminished with slightly elevated superoxide production. Mutational analysis of the patient revealed a glycine to serine substitution (G501S) in the exon 9 region [356] .

C/EBP\u03b7 is a member of the leucine zipper family of transcription factors, expressed primarily in myeloid cells [284] . Recessive mutations in the C/EBP\u03b7 gene were described in one patient; analyses of the C/EBP\u03b7 locus indicated that the disorder could have resulted from HZ recessive inheritance of the mutant allele from an ancestor shared by both parents [187] .

A wide spectrum of symptom severity, ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening illness, was observed within the nine families. The phenotype changed with age. Children displayed typical neutrophil cycles with symptoms of mucosal ulceration, lymphadenopathy, and infections [369] . Patients are usually asymptomatic, but during the period of severe neutropenia, recurrent overwhelming infections, inflammation, and ulcers occur in about 10% of patients and can lead to significant chronic morbidity [298] . Severe neutropenia was shown by 21 children, moderate by 4, and mild by 1: 16 of these children had leukopenia, 7 anemia, 2 thrombocytopenia, and 1 monocytosis.

Usually, children suffer from long-term recurrent bacterial infections, and maturation arrest of myelopoiesis at the promyelocytemyelocyte stage of BM development [12] . The disease begins during the 1st year of life, and its infectious complications include cellulitis, perirectal abscess, peritonitis, stomatitis, and meningitis, commonly as a result of infections with S. aureus, E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [42] . The numbers of circulating monocytes and eosinophils are often increased [42] . Missing the most important cells in the defense against bacterial infections, the neutrophil granulocytes, children suffer from episodes of severe, often life-threatening bacterial infections [42] . They spend many days in hospital, requiring IV antibiotic treatment. Recurrence of bacterial infections leads to irreversible tissue damage, for example in the lungs, requiring often disabling surgical interventions. A high incidence of significant bone mineral loss was seen in children with SCN [545] . The presence of qualitative and quantitative abnormalities of primitive myeloid progenitor cells expressing G-CSFR may play an important role in the impairment of granulopoiesis in these patients, thus nearly all patients have a response to pharmacological doses of rHuG-CSF: neutrophil counts rise, infection rates fall, and mortality is reduced [343] . Since the introduction of rHuG-CSF, most children enjoy a normal life span and a greatly improved quality of life, although they still have problems with infections, especially chronic gingivitis and periodontitis [82] . It is more likely that the bone loss was caused by the pathophysiological features of the underlying disease, but it is possible that rHuG-CSF accelerates bone mineral loss [545] . Prolonged administration of rHuG-CSF at a dose of 3 U/kg bw twice daily may be associated with increased bone resorption, mediated by osteoclast activation and leading to bone loss.

From the study of blood donors the prevalence may be of 0.03% in the general population [531] . Congenital deficiencies have been described for most of the proteins it is composed of (Tables 22.20 and 22 .1F [167, 169, 453, 531] , usually following the AR model. Properdin deficiency is the only complement deficiency that is X-linked [531] . HETs can be easily identified because their relevant component is present in the serum with a 50% concentration. The lack of one component at the HZ level serologically involves the blockage of enzyme release below and the absence of hemolytic activity, while that of controlling proteins causes its uncontrolled activation, consuming the factor that is the object of control and, in various ways, also of successive components [137] . Nonfunctional C1q variants have been observed, C1r and C1s deficiencies are often associated, probably because they are mapped on contiguous genes of chromosome 12 (C1q on 1) [167] . The B, C2 and C4 genes, situ-ated on the short limb of chromosome 6, constitute along with others the HLA class III (Chap. 1). C6 and C7 are codified on chromosome 5p and have a similar structure; C8 shows a different structure, because the molecule consists in three a, b and g chains, united to form two subunits, a-g and b dictated by different genes [495] . Alternative pathway deficiencies are extremely rare [328] . Complement deficiencies are accompanied by an increased frequency of infectious pathologies [155] , although it is not rare to come across them in individuals who are apparently in good health, as in the case of C2 hereditary deficiency [422] . Also frequent are teens and young adults with autoimmune manifestations (Chap. 18). Classic pathway deficiencies are often associated with SLE-like diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus), ID of the early components of complement (C1-C3) are associated with risks of infections caused by encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, as well as by meningococci [363] . The incidence of SLE in patients with C1q, C4, or C2 deficiency is 90%, 75%, and 15%, respectively [378] . Partial C4 deficiency is also associated with SLE; 15% of patients with SLE exhibit C4A deficiency [531] . Several components are associated with development of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (Table 22 .20 [167, 169, 453, 531] ). In alternative pathway ID, the infections recognize pyogens as the most common etiological agents, while final common pathway ID (C5-C9) or properdin (P) have been associated with recurrent or invasive infections by Neisseria (N) gonorrhoeae or N. meningitidis, Gramnegative bacteria, and asplenia, agammaglobulinemia [167, 169, 363, 531] . It is estimated that the frequency of meningitis in subjects with HZ deficiency of the final C5-C9 pathway is 10%, 6,000-fold higher than in non-ID individuals [363, 488] .

Episodes affecting the airways, particularly common in cellular and combined ID, tend to become longer or severe, especially if complicated by pneumonia [44] . Chronic disorders such as sinusitis and bronchiectasis (sinobronchial syndrome) are not rare; interstitial pneumonia is in most cases caused by Pneumocystis carinii and results in tachypnea and lung hyperinflation [409] . Infections supported by the Herpes simplex, EBV and CMV are also common: males with XLP exhibit a deficient response to EBV [446] . Severe and recurrent sinopulmonary, WAS, HIgES and ATA infections as well as severe RRIs in CGD, complement deficiencies and LAD 1 to V must also be borne in mind. Cases of recurrent pneumonia should be warning signals to rule in 4.8% pediatric cases of PIDs [392] . The second most important manifestation is chronic diarrhea: in some cases the infections are caused by rotavirus and enterovirus among which the ECHO: Giardia lamblia, Salmonella and Campylobacter can also cause chronic enteric infection; malabsorption resistant to treatment can be ascribed to Cryptosporidium [80] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 588, "end": 592, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 809, "end": 814, "text": "[409]", "ref_id": "BIBREF424"}, {"start": 941, "end": 946, "text": "[446]", "ref_id": "BIBREF442"}, {"start": 1208, "end": 1213, "text": "[392]", "ref_id": "BIBREF407"}, {"start": 1528, "end": 1532, "text": "[80]", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 190, "end": 199, "text": "(Table 22", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Children with PID"}, {"text": "RRIs are common in children. They reflect the immaturity of the immune system in its encounter with environmental antigens; this developmental delay during the first years of life fosters the development of RRIs. Thus, RRIs are part of the growing-up process of any child [47] . The consequences of RRIs can be of a profound and sometimes protracted alteration of the different immune defense mechanisms, which place the child in an undefended position, similar to the condition observed in children with PIDs, compromising the phagocytes, lymphocytes, NK cells, antibody production, and ILs at every occasion [419] . The responsible viruses for these infections have a development limited to surface mucous cells, spreading from cell to cell due to contiguity, while the viremic stage is absent or remains marginal. The incubation period is therefore brief, normally <3 days; consequently the immune response may not be capable of ensuring a protective function, or it only intervenes partially, clarifying the potentially unlimited number of infectious episodes [392] . From a pathogenetic point of view, the virus works by triggering the development of IgE and allergic sensitization and/or damaging the immune structures [322, 519] . In the first case, it is known that experimental infection in mice with RSV is capable of significantly increasing the absorption of ovalbumin (OVA) administered by aerosol, of IgG, IgE and anti-OVA sIgA (Fig. 4.26) and of increasing the synthesis of IgE and specific IgG to ragweed also administered by aerosol. The result is that the majority of infants become infected with RSV, although LRTIs develop in only about 20% [382] . Approximately 25%-50% of those subsequently experience recurrent acute asthma from VRI [530] . The mechanism by which VRIs induce atopic sensitization in experimental models is identified with antigen penetration and sIgE synthesis [322] . Studies show that viruses increase mucosal permeability, by modulating antigen uptake and altering antigen processing by the mucosa, which results in the IgE-suppressor T-cell depression, while IFN-g-modulated histamine release further increases mucosal permeability [162] . It is probable that the immune deficiency is secondary to VRIs, because many viruses are capable of inducing transient [521] . The lack of NK cells, which are in the front line of defense against viral infections, and with which the altered production of IL 2 and factors activating the phagocytes are associated, appears significant, but it is unclear whether the deficiency is primary or secondary to viral infections [419] . The basic question with potential therapeutic consequences therefore remains unanswered, and is probably destined to remain so until more sophisticated tests are available to clarify this issue, although the NK-cell reduction in these children corroborates the first hypothesis. Recent data emphasizes the important defensive activity of cytotoxic CD8 T cells and by different ILs, including IL 10 , IL 28 and IL 29 active in antiviral defense: if the infected cells express on the surface the viral antigen processed in association with HLA class I molecules, cytotoxic CD8 take care of killing the cell. Normally the CD8 are activated by the virus itself or by soluble factors released by the infected cells and mediate the cellular lyses after recognizing HLA class I antigens on the same cell. However, if the APC is a macrophage, it can be parasitized by the virus, with consequently reduced chemotaxis and microbicidal activity and in particular the capacity to cooperate with T cells [322] . Considering that macrophages may have evolved specific mechanisms for directing T-cell development toward the Th1, since CMI can solve some infections, it is clear that their dysfunctions appear in the insufficient NK cell activation and inadequate Th1 development in response to infections. IFN-g, produced not as a direct consequence of infection, but probably by IL 12 and/or IL 15 , stimulates the nearby cells to block the nucleic acid transcription and therefore the viral replication, preventing the infection of those cells to which virus spreads due to contiguity. Therefore the IFN-g species-specific antiviral activity takes place at the very first stages of the infection, preceding the antibodies [322] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 272, "end": 276, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 610, "end": 615, "text": "[419]", "ref_id": "BIBREF397"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1069, "text": "[392]", "ref_id": "BIBREF407"}, {"start": 1225, "end": 1230, "text": "[322,", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}, {"start": 1231, "end": 1235, "text": "519]", "ref_id": "BIBREF515"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1666, "text": "[382]", "ref_id": "BIBREF378"}, {"start": 1756, "end": 1761, "text": "[530]", "ref_id": "BIBREF526"}, {"start": 1901, "end": 1906, "text": "[322]", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}, {"start": 2176, "end": 2181, "text": "[162]", "ref_id": "BIBREF160"}, {"start": 2303, "end": 2308, "text": "[521]", "ref_id": "BIBREF517"}, {"start": 2604, "end": 2609, "text": "[419]", "ref_id": "BIBREF397"}, {"start": 3603, "end": 3608, "text": "[322]", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}, {"start": 4321, "end": 4326, "text": "[322]", "ref_id": "BIBREF335"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1442, "end": 1453, "text": "(Fig. 4.26)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Children with RRIs"}, {"text": "The response to germs' capsular polysaccharides, particularly deficient until the age of 2, although encounters with these germs are abundant during this period of time, still remains to be evaluated [508] . However, selected children, although normal from an immunological point of view, may have a deficient antibody response even aged 4-8 [195] with a percentage of modifications of both humoral and CMI, therefore not only of antibody synthesis or phagocyte and neutrophil functions, but also of T lymphocytes and related ILs [457] . It is also possible to hypothesize that persistent VRIs are capable of inducing Th2 activation by antigens or super-antigens: Th2 T cells with IL 4 help induce virus-specific CD8 + to produce IL 5 , which recruits eosinophils in the respiratory tract, thus reducing IFN-g secretion. Thus there may be an increased interaction of IgE mast cells in these subjects with immunoregulatory alterations, due to a marked lymphoproliferative response and the elaboration of other ILs, which consequently amplifies IgE production in the respiratory tract. The IgE response is thought to lead to a greater production of bronchoconstrictor mediators by effector cells; viral infections themselves may induce these cells to release histamine. It is also known that humoral deficiency, especially of IgA, very often opens the way to Gram-positive germs causing viral and bacterial infections, thereby completing the circle [409] . Interestingly, only 2/13 children have at least a significant production of antigen-specific salivary IgA against Klebsiella pneumoniae [418] . Even if the alterations are transient and aspecific in children with RRIs, their occurrence and persistence for a number of months, for a year and even longer, leads to believe that the immunosuppressive mechanisms set off by the first episode occasion more severe, profound and lasting consequences for the immune functions than those occurring in their normal peers [36, 273] . Having at least one physician-diagnosed LRTI in the 1st year of life was significantly associated with recurrent wheezing (OR, 2.0) and asthma (OR, 2.5) [89] . At the base of this exclusive predisposition in children for contracting RRIs, there is a NK cell reduction [419] and immune deficiencies related to the global lymphocyte population, the CD4 and the CD4:CD8 ratio, unbalanced toward CD4 T cells, prevalent in children expressing coughing compared to those with bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) [374] . Other T-cell deficiencies in children with humoral anomalies include a considerable spontaneous production of IL 2 and IL 4 , both generated by Th phenotypes, or alternatively by the Th0, which express both ILs [216] . It is similarly feasible that virus-specific CD8 deprived of cytolytic activity are converted into Th2-like T cells when IL 4 is present [216] . CMI in these children consists above all in the transient T-cell numeric and functional depression, coinciding with a deficiency of ILs necessary for their activation, proliferation and differentiation. The virus toxic effect also acts directly on the T cells, inciting rough structural modifications including giant polynucleate cells, which jeopardize homing and recirculation capacities, to the point of immunosuppression, affecting the specific lymphocytes for that particular virus, thus favoring the attacking organism [552] .

It has been known that RRIs during the early periods of life can play a role in the development of BHR and atopy: in the classic study by Frick et al [173] , in 11 out of 13 allergic children sensitization was propitiated by RRIs. With continued observation, the authors noted the presence of high IgE levels, positive RAST and histamine released by leukocytes after infections [172] . In a cohort of 73 asthmatic children aged 0.8-3.1, the 21 affected by 20th week of pregnancy is possible, so as to evaluate the immune phenotype in the fetal blood [491] . WCCs (white-cell counts) in CB and differential counts can be used to detect the lymphopenia that is commonly present in infants with SCID. However, subset analysis by flow cytometry is necessary to enumerate T, B and NK cells. Subsequently, SCID diagnosis will be suspected when overwhelming opportunistic infections occur [320] .

However, children with variable levels of antibody ID may end up with different diagnosis [269] . Children with HIgMS presented initially with a history of an increased susceptibility to infection including Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia [539] in 43% of children [290] . In PIDs affecting phagocytes, because of the relatively narrow spectrum of disease-specific infections (such as aspergillosis in CGD), careful attention to the microbiology laboratory early in the course of evaluation of a patient suspected of having a PID is crucial to orient the work-up in the appropriate direction [416] . In a male newborn referred to hospital at 27 days of age for fever, hemodynamic failure and an inflammation syndrome caused by pulmonary infection, culture of tracheal, bronchoalveolar lavage samples and lung biopsy grew positive for A. fumigatus, enabling the diagnosis of CGD [337] . To investigate whether patients with undiagnosed ID could be identified in diverse inpatient hospital populations, a scoring algorithm and computer screening method was updated [107] on the basis of ICD-9 codes to survey the discharge diagnoses of all hospitalized patients over periods of time. Thus 17 ID patients were identified, eight of whom were children aged 2-10 (47%), two with neutropenia, two with IgG deficiency, one with LAD, one with DGS, etc. [108] . We also suggest including congenital phagocytic defects in the differential diagnosis of recurrent bacterial or fungal infections in a child [285] .

A recent study measuring the IgG with both methods, has proved that the RID can show higher values of IgG 1 and IgG 2 in low serum levels of both Ig [387] , data with an unquestionable negative effect in pediatrics.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 234, "end": 239, "text": "[153]", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}, {"start": 394, "end": 399, "text": "[113]", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 561, "end": 566, "text": "[198,", "ref_id": "BIBREF178"}, {"start": 567, "end": 571, "text": "317]", "ref_id": "BIBREF314"}, {"start": 631, "end": 635, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 718, "end": 723, "text": "[198]", "ref_id": "BIBREF178"}, {"start": 901, "end": 906, "text": "[317]", "ref_id": "BIBREF314"}, {"start": 971, "end": 976, "text": "[198]", "ref_id": "BIBREF178"}, {"start": 1128, "end": 1133, "text": "[387]", "ref_id": "BIBREF383"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Specific tests"}, {"text": "In conclusion, at the moment our knowledge suggests that we should also carefully interpret low levels of one or more subclasses, because on the one hand this might indicate a transient or paraphysiological condition, on [174] . IgG levels in all patients also rose considerably compared to previous treatment: the average levels in different determinations was >700 mg [174] . Finally, all children grew normally; the height achieved by each child is between the 3 rd and 50 th percentile, within the limits of theoretical values calculated on the height of their parents. Substituting therapy with IVIg has allowed patients to return to their normal activities, with a considerable improvement in quality of life. In all these years, we have never come across substantial unwelcome reactions or infectious complications [174] , as also found by other authors [177, 461] . IVIg could also be effective for reducing the allergic symptoms discussed thus far: presuppositions are not lacking, such as the blocking of allergens and mastocyte FcR thanks to the modest quantities of IgG 4 present in the preparations [196] . In addition, the increased understanding of the IgG transplacental passage (Chap. 2) can absolve the function of timing their transfusion in the case of mothers with antibody ID, so that the fetal defenses can be complete and quantitatively adequate. In SIgAD common IVIg preparations cannot be used, even if with a low content of IgA, nor enriched, both because of the extremely short IgA life-span, which would therefore suggest IgA administration every 2-3 days, and because the infused IgA do not reach the secretions [507] . Should IVIg be indicated for a deficiency associated with IgG 2 , or should transfusions of blood derivatives become necessary, one must first investigate serum antibody anti-IgA levels (IgG and IgE) and, should these be positive, avoid infusions or administer them in a hospital under strict medical supervision, or use washed red blood cells [507] . The same precaution must be taken for subjects with ATA for whom IVIg, if is appropriately administered, also ensure beneficial effects on quality of life, while there are no known therapies for contrasting neurological symptoms. In patients with humoral deficiency, alongside IVIg, if appropriate, an antibiotic prophylaxis is suitable with monthly cycles, alternating amoxicillin, cephalosporin, co-trimoxazole, etc., bearing in mind family compliance. In CVID recurrent infections caused by Giardia lamblia should be treated using furazolidone (8 mg/kg/day) or methronidazole (15 mg/kg/day) for 10 days, if necessary to be repeated.

Subnormal IgG 2 levels can indeed be associated with various manifestations of immune dysfunctions; it is therefore advisable in this case to proceed with specific investigations, measuring the response to polysaccharide antigens and studying the lymphocyte activity in vitro [451] . In children with normal serum levels, who are instead lacking in antibody responses to polysaccharide antigens [143, 430] , this is a conclusive investigation [470] (Fig. 22.47) .

There are >375 patients worldwide who have survived SCID as a result of successful transplantation of HLA-identical or haploidentical BM [67] . Most importantly, 34 of 35 infants (97%) undergoing transplantation in the first 3.5 months of life are currently alive [69, 338] , compared with a cut-off at 6 months (97% vs 86%, children younger vs those aged >6 months) receiving BMT (OR 5.0 [14] ). We stress that neonates developed higher lymphocyte responses to phytohemagglutinin and higher numbers of CD3 + and CD45RA + T cells in the first 3 years of life than those receiving BMTs late. T-cell antigens peaked earlier and with higher values in the neonatal BMTs (181 days to 1 year) than in the late BMTs (1-3 years) [338] .

Only 40% of these children may find a matched donor; therefore, the remaining PID-affected children are candidates for a TCD haploidentical BMT [277] .

The requisite for applying this form of genetic engineering treatment is that the responsible gene must be cloned; the most common techniques involve knock-out mice and inactivating a particle [104] , or employing retroviral vectors (Table 22 .32) [263] , totally deprived of their genomic factors except for the normal copy of the gene to be inserted. This is indispensable for allowing the vector to reach the human nucleus, where it will integrate with the cellular genome [263] . In this case, PBLs are collected through leukapheresis and cultivated in vitro with retroviral particles containing a normal gene RNA copy: thus the healthy gene is introduced into the cell genome using a vector and the manipulated cells are reinfused, so as to restore normal immune functions. This system has been used to treat two children aged 2 months suffering from SCID [508] and from ADA deficiency by employing autologous PBLs [51] , BM cells [54] , and CB cells [262] . Three reports [4, 88, 204] of successful gene therapy in infants with X-linked SCID [88, 204] and in T -B -SCID [4] are a major step forward among repeated efforts to achieve better immune reconstitution in ADA-SCID with gene therapy than with BMT/SCT [161] . Immediately after the diagnosis had been made in two capacity of wild-type, replication-competent retroviruses to cause leukemia in immunologically immature neonatal mice [263] , and in humans (two children out of 11) [63, 88, 204] . Retroviruses can cause insertional oncogenesis, a long-known potential complication of retroviral gene transfer attempts, because gene integration occurs at random in the genome, thus deregulating the expression of cellular oncogenes [263] . This complication has been thought to be unlikely with such vectors, because they are capable of inserting only once into the cell's chromosomes and cannot repeatedly reproduce and integrate. Lentiviruses may be more effective than murine retroviruses for gene transfer into human hematopoietic SCs and T lymphocytes [263] . In ADA-SCID, the safety and efficacy of HSC gene therapy combined with nonmyeloablative conditioning for the treatment of SCID has allowed two children to live at home and clinically well, with normal growth and development [4] . On January 14, 2003, FDA placed on \"clinical hold\" all active gene therapy trials using retroviral vectors to insert genes into blood SCs after having learned that a second child treated in the French gene therapy trial developed a leukemia-like condition.

In SCID, the European experience with unfractionated HLA-identical and TCD or non-TCD haploidentical or MUD BMTs in patients with SCID reported that between 1968 and 1999, a 3-year survival with sustained engraftment was significantly better after HLA-identical than after mismatched transplantation (77% vs 54%).Within the HLA-identical group, survival after BMT from genotypically or phenotypically identical related or MUDs was 81%, 72%, and 63%, respectively [14] . In non-SCID, 3-year survival after genotypically HLA-matched, phenotypically HLA-matched, MMRD, and MUD BMT was 71%, 42%, 42%, and 59%, respectively [14] . In a retrospective analysis of BMTs performed between 1977 and 1991 at 13 European centers in 149 children as young as 1 month with 11 different PIDs (excluding SCID), the overall survival among 53 recipients of HLA genetically identical BMT was 66%, 45.5% in 22 patients who received closely matched BMT, and 38% in 71 recipients of BMT with two or three mismatched HLA antigens. A significant improvement in survival has been achieved in most PIDs (overall survival, 81.5% vs 51.7%, primarily because of a decrease in the frequency of infectious complications [163] . In the similar analysis performed in 193 children with SCID at 18 European centers between 1982 and 1993, 116 out of 193 (60.1%) patients were alive with evidence of engraftment 6 months after BMT. However, 24 patients died >6 months post-BMT, mainly due to cGVHD and/ or viral infection. Thus GvHD 6 months after BMT and B -SCID vs B + SCID were the main factors associated with a poor outcome [206] . The disease-free survival was significantly better for patients with B + SCID (60.7%) than for those with B -SCID (33.3%) [14] . In a children aged 8 and 11 months including a novel splice imitation in the common gc chain [183] , haploidentical CD34 + peripheral progenitor cells mobilized with GM-CSF were isolated to a purity of more than 99%. These cells were infused with no prior chemoablation and no prophylaxis against GvHD. Both children showed signs of T-cell reconstitution beginning 3 weeks after the CD34 + infusion and were weaned from continuous cures. They are in excellent health, without GvHD, 34 and 68 months after transplantation. One child does not need replacement Ig. The other received a booster infusion of CD34 + SCs from the original donor 1 year later to improve B-cell function and now receives Ig every 3 months. Both were followed for 10 months after gene transfer [88] . However, retroviral vectors have the 1339 Treatment Data from [4, 76, 104] .

BM was TCD by use of either erythrocyte rosetting or monoclonal antibodies to prevent GvHD [231] . Additional survival rates were reported previously (Table 22 .30). In a series of consecutive UD BMTs 31/33 children with SCID and non-SCID PIDs who received a BMT with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen between 1998 and 2001 survived after a 3.3-year follow-up, as well as 10/19 children who received a BMT with myeloablative conditioning (MAT) between 1994 and 1998 and survived after an 8.6-year follow-up. Therefore a RIC regimen results in improved survival and reduced BMT-related mortality compared with MAT in HR children undergoing an UD BMT [396] . In 170 transplanted patients with WAS, the 5-year probability of survival differed according to donor type: 87% with HLA-identical sibling donors, 52% with other related donors, and 71% with MUD. Significantly, boys who had received a MUD transplant before 5 years of age had survival rates similar to those receiving HLAidentical sibling transplants [158] . However, the time required to develop immune function after haploidentical SCTs is quite different from that after unfractionated HLA-identical BM. Lymphocytes with mature T-cell phenotypes and functions fail to rise significantly until 3-4 months after BMT; normal T-cell function is reached between 4 and 7 months [338] . B-cell function develops much more slowly, averaging 2-2.5 years for normalization; many do not have B-cell function, despite normal T-cell function. [338] . Ex vivo rigorous depletion of post-thymic T cells from donor marrow that cause GvHD is efficient and feasible, even in haploidentical settings [13] , presumably because of more effective infection-control measures and better transplantation strategy [514] . For non-SCID, SCT can provide a cure, and grafts from unrelated donors are almost as beneficial as those from genetically HLA-identical relatives [45] . In most patients, deficient B-cell function persists after transplantation and requires lifelong IVIg therapy [69, 207] , which is necessary to prevent bacterial and common viral infections [69, 514] . Some patients also have persistent deficiencies of T-cell function after SCT [206, 373] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 473, "end": 477, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 629, "end": 633, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1198, "end": 1203, "text": "[163]", "ref_id": "BIBREF161"}, {"start": 1601, "end": 1606, "text": "[206]", "ref_id": "BIBREF186"}, {"start": 1731, "end": 1735, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1831, "end": 1836, "text": "[183]", "ref_id": "BIBREF199"}, {"start": 2505, "end": 2509, "text": "[88]", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 2574, "end": 2577, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2578, "end": 2581, "text": "76,", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 2582, "end": 2586, "text": "104]", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 3136, "end": 3141, "text": "[231]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3705, "end": 3710, "text": "[396]", "ref_id": "BIBREF411"}, {"start": 4064, "end": 4069, "text": "[158]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4388, "end": 4393, "text": "[338]", "ref_id": "BIBREF315"}, {"start": 4546, "end": 4551, "text": "[338]", "ref_id": "BIBREF315"}, {"start": 4697, "end": 4701, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 4804, "end": 4809, "text": "[514]", "ref_id": "BIBREF510"}, {"start": 4958, "end": 4962, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 5075, "end": 5079, "text": "[69,", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 5080, "end": 5084, "text": "207]", "ref_id": "BIBREF187"}, {"start": 5155, "end": 5159, "text": "[69,", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 5160, "end": 5164, "text": "514]", "ref_id": "BIBREF510"}, {"start": 5244, "end": 5249, "text": "[206,", "ref_id": "BIBREF186"}, {"start": 5250, "end": 5254, "text": "373]", "ref_id": "BIBREF369"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2716, "end": 2724, "text": "Table 22", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 3195, "end": 3204, "text": "(Table 22", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Antibody Deficiency"}, {"text": "In children with RRIs, depending on the nature of the infection, the pediatrician will prescribe the most appropriate symptomatic and/or antibiotic therapy.

We suggest monitoring measures, such as keeping a clinical diary, in which each acute episode should be briefly noted, continuing registration until clinical symptoms have not regressed for at least 15 days and returning to keep notes in the diary each time there is a cough and/or nasal and/or bronchial inflammation, completing this with PEF as well as some respiratory parameters right at the beginning and then every 6 months.

Considering the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial stock, as for example S. pneumoniae, immunotherapy has been proposed as a means of preventing RRIs by providing children with small doses of inactive bacterial antigens liable to trigger specific and protective immune responses (Table 22 .33) [36] . For example, OM-85 BV significantly reduces the URTI rate, particularly in a DBPC study in 232 children aged 3-8 with a history of acute URTIs [448] , is active in preventing RRI episodes [36] with a meaningful reduction in the number of days of suffering acute URTIs [448] . Bacterial ribosomal and membrane proteoglycans of S. pneumoniae, which stimulate B cells with secretory responses, as well as memory cells, may be used for responding to future infections [36] . Ribosomal immunotherapy appears to be not only well tolerated, but also ideally targeted to induce mucosal responses [37] . Among the preparations reserved for specific use, a study of pidotimod in DBPC trials proved its effectiveness in a sample of 101 children with RRIs, also showing increased CD25, absent in placebo-treated children [72] . The use of immunostimulants should be limited to children with proven high susceptibility to acute URTI, or overexposed children attending daycare facilities, or attending kindergarten or elementary school [508] . However, according to a meta-analysis, immunostimulants are an effective treatment for the prevention of acute URTI in children [40] . Furthermore the indiscriminate and purely empiric use of IVIg must be discouraged in every child with RRI, whereas in a prospective, DBPC study of IVIg and co-trimoxazole, 106 of 130 children <8 years referred for recurrent bacterial RRIs became infection-free over a 4-month obser-if caused by pneumococci.

The pediatrician is entrusted with a more difficult job, that of identifying as early as possible the possible existence of PID, remembering the suggestions for case history in Chap. 6, with the exception of clinical emergencies such as Omenn syndrome and reticular dysgenesis. This specific research becomes a necessity thanks to the new diagnostic and therapeutic advances that have been conceived over the past few years: the earlier one acts, on the one hand with a prenatal diagnosis and on the other with a BMT or SCT therapy, the greater the chance to increase life expectancy for these children, in addition to ensuring better quality of life. The discovery and cloning of the genes for these diseases have obvious implications for the potential of gene therapy. The rapidity of these advances suggests that there will soon be many more to come. One of the most common differential diagnoses will occur with a child affected by RRIs, for whom we believe the number of infections must be immediately clarified, although evaluated according to different numeric and epidemiologic factors, not associated with those which instead concern the severity and the site of the infection as well as the type of the pathogenic agent that characterize children with PID.
