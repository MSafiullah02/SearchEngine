As of 10 March 2020, confirmed cases of COVID-19 have reached 10,000 in Italy, exceeded 1,000 in Spain, France, and Germany, and grew quickly in other European countries. (WHO, 2020) In terms of deaths caused by COVID-19, more than 800 were reported in Italy, approximately 50 were reported in Spain and France, but only 3 were reported in Germany. Based on the diversity in the number of infected cases and deaths, European and local authorities should adopt country-specific measures to prevent onward transmission of COVID-19.",

Given the rapid increase of COVID-19 in Europe, it is urgent to understand the transmissibility and mortality in key European countries to guide the implementation of prioritized prevention and control measures. The real-time reproduction number (R(t)), defined as the number of secondary cases one case would produce over the course of the outbreak, is useful to monitor the transmissibility of COVID-19 over time. (Wallinga and Teunis, 2004) Therefore, R(t) calculates the effective reproduction number when immunity intervention measures are implemented. By contrast, the basic reproduction number (R0) is the reproduction number when no immunity from past exposures or vaccination, nor any deliberate intervention in disease transmission has been carried out. As a result, it is more appropriate to use R(t) to monitor the real-time transmissibility when public measures are in place. The case fatality rate (CFR) can be used to measure the mortality rate.",

First, due to limited laboratory capacity, the actual epidemic may not be reflected by counts of laboratory-confirmed cases reported. Second, the estimation of the reproduction number is heavily dependent on generation time, which may be hard to obtain in an early outbreak. Third, fitting the real-life epidemic curve to the statistical model is challenging. Fourth, the constant assumption of CFR may be violated if a new treatment emerges or more mild cases are identified over the course of the epidemic.",

The ECDC should monitor the transmissibility and mortality in European countries to prevent the transmission and reduce the death of COVID-19. If a rapid increase in cases of COVID-19 is found in any country, the ECDC should work closely with the WHO to visit that country and provide recommendations and support control and prevention efforts. Special attention should be paid to Italy to understand the effects of the country lockdown on the spread of COVID-19 both within and outside Italy. Due to the recent rapid increase in new cases of COVID-19, real-time monitoring of the transmissibility and mortality in Spain and France is a priority. Even though the outbreak of COVID-19 is still an important concern in Germany, it is beneficial to learn on measures related to the low mortality rate. Other European countries should continue to prepare for and respond to COVID-19 and learn from Italy, Spain, France, and Germany on relevant prevention and control measures.",
