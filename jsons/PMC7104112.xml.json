We believe that the pathological mechanism of infection of H7N9 subtype of avian influenza virus may resemble to other viral pneumonia and is based on alveolar exudation. The lesions can develop into either multiple or diffuse at both lungs with rapid progress at the progressive stage, or reticulation when the abnormalities improve later into the later stage (after 20 days) [5], [6]. According to the evolution process by radiology, infection of H7N9 subtype of avian influenza virus can be divided into three stages. The initial stage is the first 3 days after onset. The progressive stage is the period of d 3-15 after onset. Period since d 15 after onset is defined as the stable stage. The stable stage is protracted for some cases due to the remaining viral infection in addition with bacterial infections. Pleural effusions are rarely seen and lymph node enlargement is not significant.",

The main imaging findings of S-OIV infection and SARS are unilateral or bilateral GGO or focal areas of consolidations with a predominant peribronchovascular and subpleural distribution [8], [9], [10], while H7N9 subtype avian influenza infection presents pulmonary segment or lobar exudative lesions without obvious distinctive distribution. Bacterial pneumonia usually shows lobar consolidation and increased WBC clinically, which can recover quickly by antibiotic therapy. The imaging findings of H7N9 subtype infection of avian influenza virus resemble to those of H5N1 subtype infection of avian influenza virus, both of which have pulmonary segment or lobar exudative lesions as the predominant imaging findings except that multifocal consolidations have a predilection at lower lobes in cases of H5N1 subtype infection of avian influenza virus [11]. However, differential diagnosis relies on virus isolation and detection [6].",
