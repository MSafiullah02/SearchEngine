Everyone from the age of 5 to 65 years is on social media every day with billions of users sending messages, sharing information, comments, and the like [1]. With the advancement in information technology, social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn are available for the users to interact with families, colleagues, and friends. As a result, social activities are shifting from real things to virtual machines [2]. Analyzing the behavior of individuals from social networking sites is a complex task because there are several methods used. By gathering information from different resources and then analyzing that information, the behavior of the users can be examined. In this research, we have collected different studies about assessing human behavior with the help of social media and compared them according to the different methods used by different authors [3].",

From these methods, the most common technique to analyze the behavior of individuals was analysis techniques. From this study, it is clear that there is need for more research to predict the personality and behavior of individuals on the Instagram. This study found that 50% of research was done on Twitter and 11 different analysis techniques were sued. While reviewing the research articles, it was clear that the researchers have used more than one method for data collection and behavior analysis. Table 1 has all the data analysis of the paper reviewed in the study. Furthermore, unlike past research papers, this chapter included the attributes of the number of users and the limitations of the work done. These studies mostly focused on Twitter with some research on Facebook and Instagram. In this research paper, we have attempted to fill the gap by including the number of users and limitation attributes. There are some challenges to find the solutions to the issues that have been discussed, but these require urgent attention. This study should be useful as a reference for researchers interested in the analysis of the behavior of social media users.",
