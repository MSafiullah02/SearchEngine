In order to prove that no special bacteria caused cholera, even before the Hamburg outbreak, Professor Pettenkofer and two members of his staff (two assistants) swallowed the liquid contents of a vial containing cultured cholera vibrio bacteria. On his request, the vial was sent to Professor Pettenkofer by Professor Koch. The three self-infected volunteers became ill with diarrhoea but survived. They were claiming gloriously thereafter that it was not the cholera vibrio that caused cholera and/or the deadly epidemic now in Hamburg.",

Anion channels opened up by VCC in the membranes of enterocytes trigger an outpouring of chloride, sodium and water; such efflux results in the watery diarrhoea and dehydration of the host [4]. The infamous El Tor biotype belongs to the O1 serogroup. The El Tor vibrios carry multiple antibiotic-resistance gene clusters within transposon-like structures (cassettes; constins, operons). The genes confer resistance of the vibrio to streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and chloramphenicol (STX). The STX genes reside within a large integrating conjugative element (ICE). The transfer of these excised gene clusters occurs by conjugation and integration (not by phage-mediation) [5\u20137]. In two chromosomes (one large, one small) vibrios carry 142 and 42 single copy genes, and gene clusters for virulence and the inserted genomes of its prophages, respectively. Smaller genetic entities in the cytoplasms are the plasmids, frequently the vectors of horizontal gene transfers (\u201crampant\u201d such activity) [8].",

            "text": "The pathogenic cholera vibrios (V. cholerae or V. mimicus) replicate in the small intestine, and release their AB-type toxin, thus inducing the profuse secretory diarrhoea leading to electrolyte losses, profound dehydration, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin shock [9] and death. Cell surface gangliosides bind the pentameric subunit CTB. The cholera toxin CTA after transgressing the plasma membrane of the host cell is taken up by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the ER, the monomeric subunit A1 chain is unfolded and directed to pass through the protein-conducting channel into the cytosol. Escaping degradation by proteasomes, the toxin refolds and acts [10]. The innate proinflammatory responses induced by the cholera toxins consist of the activation of the Akt cascade resulting in the overproduction of interleukin-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and the translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus of nuclear factor kappa B lineage lymphocyte (NF-\u03baB) [11] The major immunosuppressive effect of the cholera toxin is inhibition of IL-12 production in dendritic cells (DCs), thus it is the abrogation of a Th1-type immune response in the gut. This is further achieved by the inhibition of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-8 (IRF8), thus plasmacytoid DCs remain undifferentiated non-IFN producers. Even if IL-12 were produced, CTAB inhibit the expression of IL-12R (beta receptors \u03b21 and \u03b22). Immune T cells, if generated, do not release interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3). The immunoglobulin response is mainly that of IgE; thus further toxin outpour is not neutralized, but it is reacted to with anaphylactoid events culminating in shock [12]. The beta subunit of CTB induces a tolerogenic response mediated by both antigen-specific FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) and by transforming growth factor-beta- (TGF-\u00df) and IL-10-producing T cells [13]. The major V. cholerae toxins are the cholera toxin (CTAB), neuraminidase, chitinase and LPS endotoxin. In V. cholerae antigen- (toxin-) exposed mice, peritoneal macrophages died apoptotic deaths [14].",

Patients recovering from cholera withstand a second exposure to V. cholerae. These individuals possess memory B and T cells in Peyers\u2019 patches and in the circulating blood. Antibodies reacting to re-exposure are of the IgA and IgG classes and react with LPS and CTAB [15]. During the acute disease and in convalescence, patients begin circulating CD4+ and CD8+ gut-homing T, and CD19+ B cells, Upon stimulation with vibrio cell membrane or TCP (toxin co-regulated pilus) antigens, these cells respond by clonal expansion and release of INF-\u03b3 (for Th1-type immunity) and/or IL-13 (for Th2-type immunity) [16]. These immune reactions serve as reasoning for the development of preventive cholera vaccines. The vaccines offer good to partial protection, but their immune efficacy weakens without re-vaccination [17\u201320]. The Peru-15 (CholeraGarde; AVANT) live-attenuated oral vaccine was safely and effectively administered to Bangladesh infants and toddlers [21\u201323]. The College of Medicine, University of Central Florida is developing a united malaria-cholera vaccine [24].",

            "text": "There exist natural vibrio isolates that harbor a provirus CTX\u03d5, which does not possess the ctxA and ctxB genes. In addition, these prophages lack the upstream control region normally located 5\u2032 of ctxA, and the promoter region and coding sequences of ctxB. In these phages, the ancestral precursor of the CTX\u03d5 phage was found still in existence. Therefore the ctxAB genes do not behave as vertically transmitted genuine phage genes; they are acquired genes and as such they were gained through horizontal transfer [28, 29]. The cluster of these genes and their regulatory sequences must have been acquired simultaneously. Horizontal transfer of the CTX\u03d5 genes must have occurred repeatedly. The CTX\u03d5 phage enters the vibrio through its type IV pilus, TCP (vide supra). The cluster of vibrio genes encoding the pilus can be transmitted between vibrios by unknown mechanisms [30]. The OrfU (open reading frame) protein binds CTX\u03d5 phage particles to TCP, as their attachment receptor. The pili serve the bacterium as essential colonization factors in the human small intestine. The bacterial flagellae penetrate the mucosal layers of the small intestine. Flagella loss (Fgl\u2013) releases the anti-sigma and alternative sigma factors and these repress quorum sensing regulators with the release of virulence factors [31]. Excessive colonization frequently assumes the form of biofilms [32, 33]. The CTX\u03d5 phages infecting classical and El Tor vibrios are distinct, but diverged from a common ancestor. It is the orfU and zot (zona occludens toxin) genes of these CTX\u03d5 lineages that show this divergence. It was not the ancestral CTX\u03d5 that infected an ancestral vibrio, but rather it was its two lineages, which infected separately the classical and El Tor vibrios. Phage CTX\u03d5 of Vibrio cholerae could infect Vibrio mimicus and transfer horizontally the cluster of these genes with their regulatory sequences into its new host. V. cholerae and V. mimicus diverged from a common ancestor, and their acquisition of CTX\u03d5 occurred after their divergence. First V. cholerae might have been infected, and from there ctxAB operon was horizontally transferred by CTX\u03d5 into V. mimicus [28].",

In 1994, the O1 serogroup El Tor strain recurred and re-occupied its territory. Later in 1996, O139 re-emerged and thereafter co-existed with O1 El Tor V. cholerae [34]. The new O139 V. cholerae strain derived from an ancestral El Tor vibrio with preservation of its virulence factors, but with new and different serotype. V. cholerae O139 exhibits the insertion of a large new genomic region foreign to the pre-existing O1 El Tor strains, while the O139 vibrio suffered a deletion all of its O1 antigen-specific gene cluster. The O-antigen biosynthesis gene cluster occupies the wbf (wild-type biofilm) region in the genome of the vibrio O139. The O139 LPS is antigenically different from that of the O1 El Tor vibrio. Patients recovering from O1 El Tor vibrio-caused cholera remain susceptible to infection with the vibrio O139. A large portion (22-kb) of DNA strands of the regulator of biofilm region (wbf; rfb) was deleted in the O139 vibrio. This deleted region is replaced by a new fully sequenced 35-kb wbf region encoding the O139 antigen. It is also possible that the new DNA segment was not transposed from an outside source, but that it originated by homologous recombination events within the ancestral El Tor vibrio residing in biofilm colonies on chitin surfaces (chitin skeletons of crustaceans) in aquatic reservoirs, where resistance acquired against bacteriophages were the driving force. The emergence of O139 vibrios in the intestinal tract of individuals who survived prior exposure to O1 El Tor V. cholerae indicates that ineffective host immune reactions might be another driving force of the transformation [35\u201337]. Chitin-induced natural transformation resulting in O1 conversion to a different serogroup (non-139 and O139) occurred experimentally. It is the O1 recipient (the El Tor vibrio) that acquires a new O139 LPS-antigen-encoding cassette. These cassettes are incorporated into the recipient genomes by homologous recombination. The exact mechanism of such large gene cluster (operons) transfers from the transformed vibrios into not yet transformed vibrios remains unclear. Under consideration are conjugative plasmids as vectors, transducing but as yet undiscovered phages, and other as yet unrecognized mechanisms.",

There are no toxin-encoding genes in the genome of this lytic phage [46, 47].

From the point of view of the bacterium, the toxin promotes its colonization in the gut of cattle (or human patients) and protects it from bactivorous protozoa, like Tetrahymena pyriformis in the colon of the cattle [49].

Both the genomic islands (GI) containing the virulence genes (named in the article) and the genomic modules (GM), five GMs listed one by one in the article, were transferred. The new HPI contained integration sites to a mobile DNA element. The mobile DNA element was able to excise, circularize and insert the HPI at multiple sites: multiple combinatorial transfers of both GI and GM occurred [51]. In the USA, uropathogenic E. coli, and in France, Salmonella typhimurium, enterohemorrhagic and uropathogenic E. coli are suspect to have acquired through horizontal transfer HPIs.

The 6.9-kb genome of CTX\u03d5 integrates into the genome of its host, the vibrio (V. cholerae). Replication sequences (RS) encode the enzymes needed for the integration of the viral genome into the host genome. The genome of the classical El Tor vibrio does not offer an integration site to the phage. In this host, the CTX\u03d5 phage exists as an extrachromosomal circular DNA plasmid. Several genuine phage genes encode the structural proteins of the virus and their assembly into a particle (among them open reading frame U, orfU, and zona occludens toxin, zot). The non-integrated plasmid is the replicative form (RF) of the phage and produces an abundance of viral particles. These plasmids lack ctxAB and ToxR binding sites, but possess a zot sequence, which is different from the zot gene of the pathogenic ctxAB-containing integrated phage. These plasmids must have derived from the ancestral preCTX\u03d5 phages. Not the host cell, but ctxA and ctxB gene-carrier phages encode the cholera toxins CTXAB. The GC content (34\u201337%) of the three ctxAB genes (CTXET\u03d5, CTXclass\u03d5, CTXcalc\u03d5) significantly differ from that of the genuine phage genes. The ctxAB phage genes must have evolved differently from the genuine phage genes. There is no similarity, indeed there is a lack of congruence, between the genuine vibrio gene mdh (encoding malate dehydrogenase) and the two phage genes orfU and zot (required for coat proteins and their assembly). The mdh genes are identical in classical and El Tor epidemic V. cholerae isolates, whereas the CTX\u03d5 genes are widely divergent. Thus, CTX\u03d5 genes behave like mobile genetic elements [28]. Indeed, ctxB contains a Mariner-based transposon [52]. The pathogenicity genes of V. cholerae operate from pathogenicity islands of the genome. Vibrio pathogenicity island-2 (VPI-2) encodes integrase, recombinase, a restriction modification system, Mu phage-like proteins, neuraminidase and glycosylhydrolase, and other sialic acid metabolizing enzymes; these enzymes expose GM1 gangliosides, which serve as receptors for cholera toxin. El Tor and O139 cholera vibrios operate the vibrio seventh pandemic island (VSP). These islands can excise and re-insert themselves from and to the vibrios\u2019 genome [53]: ready for horizontal transfer and insertion. These horizontally transferred and genomically inserted virulence genes have been acquired \u201crecently\u201d and repeatedly, are clustered in several chromosomal regions and derived from an unknown original source [54].",

Vibriophage-mediated CT gene horizontal transfers between donor O1 El Tor to recipient non-O1/O139 vibrios occurred recently in California coastal waters [62].",

The ds replicative form (RF) of the RS1 element was marked with a kanamycin resistance (Kmr) marker (pRS1-Km). The pRS1-KM construct in O1 vibrios acted like the filamentous phage RS1-Km\u03d5. All classical, El Tor and O139 vibrios are susceptible to this phage; nontoxigenic (CTX\u2013) vibrios encoding TCP are the most susceptible. Using the integration sequence attRS (attachment), the RS1\u03d5 genomes also integrate into vibrio chromosomes. Only fused genomes of RS1-Km\u03d5CTX\u03d5 generated extracellular phage particles. Thus, these phages are transmitted vertically in the host vibrios, but are able to propagate horizontally as well. The cholera toxin-encoding, ctxAB gene-carrier CTX\u03d5 integrates into host cell chromosome at attachment site attRS due to the RS2 region within the CTX\u03d5 genome. The RS region encodes regulatory, replicative, and integrative functions of the CTX\u03d5 phage. The integrated toxigenic CTX\u03d5 genomes are flanked by the RS1 element possessing ORFs rstA, B, R; RS1 expresses one additional ORF, rstC. The RS1 excised from the chromosome may act as a filamentous phage particle, but without containing CTX\u03d5 genomic elements. In contrast, in CTX\u03d5 virions the RS1 gene rstC is replaced by the core genes of CTX\u03d5. The RS1 genome encodes the RstR repressor protein. The CTX\u03d5 genome carries the gene for the RS2-encoded repressor protein. Phage-induced repressor proteins in many phage-carrier bacterial genera maintain the lysogenic state. By the acquisition of its own new core genes, CTX\u03d5 separated from its ancestor, the RS1 element, and became a new phage. Its RS1 ancestry is further evidenced by the ability of CTX\u03d5 to integrate into its host cells\u2019 genome [63a].",

The estimate was offered that 1025 phage infections occur/sec worldwide; counting retroactively for 3 billion years, the number of phage infections that had taken place on Earth is incalculable (cited in [64]). Metagenomic characterization of the viral flora is discovering innumerable new members of viral genera.

This is the environment in which V. cholerae and its phage CTX\u03d5 acquired the CT genes ctxAB from an unknown external source. What is the biological function of the gene product proteins, the CTAB, in the vibrio? It is in the virulence island where the genes tcp encoding the pilus TCP reside. It was by sequential acquisition that the predecessor of V. cholerae acquired then the tcp and ctxAB genes [64]. However, the biochemical function of the CTAB in the human small intestine (vide supra) indicates that these molecules fit best into eukaryotic biological systems, thus must have originated from a eukaryote host.",

This system consists of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats with closely associated genes (CRISPR; CASS). If this antiviral mechanism worked faultlessly, phages and viruses would have been extinguished from the rest of evolution. However, viruses are able to circumvent the CRISPR/CASS barrier [72]. The system was found to be installed in V. cholerae O395: this vibrio is capable of mediating an RNAi interference pathway [73].

Its pathogenicity island is devoid of the toxP and tcpP/tcpH (hemolytic) genes, yet it could not protect itself from transformation to the El Tor vibrio class as it has accepted the phage-mediated horizontal insertion of the ctxAB operon.

The title of this report does not reflect to its deep penetration into basic immunology [78]. Crab hemocytes and some parenchymal cells express antibacterial peptides (crustin; anti-lipopolysaccharide factor) in response to V. alginolyticus infection [79]; through these responses, some of the afflicted hosts survive as vibrio-carriers. Halophilic vibrios are rich in substances (neuraminidase, hemolysin, permeability factor, lethal toxin) which kill mammalian cells [80]. The toxic gyr (gyrase) gene was present, while the CT ctx genes were so far not identified in halophilic vibrios [81] The vibrios notoriously carry phages and release plasmids. For example, the halophilic vibrio, V. alginolyticus possesses covalently closed circular plasmids 6,075 bp in length with 42% GC content and seven ORFs encoding over one hundred amino acid length sequences. These encoded proteins are relaxases, replicases and mobilization proteins (MobC) [82]. The vibrios deriving from these hosts may go through the human food chain. The vibrios are not intracellular bacteria, but they adhere to cell surfaces. Could the vibrios pick up eukaryotic genes? Could the phages or plasmids of the vibrios incorporate such eukaryotic genes deriving from their hosts? Of these possibilities, the last step is the most likely: that is, vibrios co-express their phage receptors and exchange their phages and plasmids. This imaginary chain of events presumes the acquisition of eukaryotic genes by a vibrio and its phage in their natural habitat (vide infra).",

An imaginary sequence of events is envisioned, in which a toxin-producer marine/aquatic-estuarian eukaryotic host is infected by a phage-carrier bacterium: a vibrio. The bacterium acquires the toxin gene from its host and gains invasiveness and proliferative advantage. The lysogenic phage integrated its genome into the genome of its host bacterium, the vibrio. The phage excises its genome from the bacterial genome. The genuine phage genes in the excised genome include full or close to full sequences of the toxin gene(s). At burst, the liberated phage particles find another host bacterium, which they invade and into whose genome they integrate their phage genome. That newly infected bacterium has pathogenicity (virulence) islands towards mammalian (including human) hosts. The integrated toxin gene-carrier phage genome encodes the toxin. The bacterium gains invasiveness and proliferative advantages in his infected host due to the expression of the toxin proteins. The infected host dies due to the pathophysiological effects of the toxin (vide infra).",

Extreme intraphylum diversity characterizes cyanobacterial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Horizontal gene insertions, deletions and gene duplications created inconsistencies in the evolutionary course of these enzymes, the intraphylum diversity of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases [114]. Filamentous freshwater cyanobacteria and the dinoflagellates Alexandrium spp. produce paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins, but encoded from different gene clusters [115a]. The 26 putative saxitoxin genes (stxA to stxZ : STX) were identified in toxic cyanobacteria (not to be mistaken for the STX antibiotic resistance gene-product proteins). Some of these genes (17 of them) are of cyanobacterial origin. Other genes in the cluster originate from different other cyanobacteria species, a halodurans archaea, the delta-proteobacterium Myxococcus xanthus, and the actinobacterium, Frankia. A methyltransferase may be of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense derivation. The non-cyanobacterial genes were acquired through horizontal transfers. Did the dinoflagellate Alexandrium receive cyanobacterial toxin genes in exchange? The abundant cyanobacterial phages (myo-, podo-, and siphoviruses) are diligent vectors of host cell genes. For example, the bacterial photosystem-I and II genes are propagated by cyanophages. A unique, not T4-like myovirus cyanophage infects the blooming and toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa. The M. aeruginosa toxin induces hepatocellular carcinoma in experimental animals. This phage possesses a large 162, 109 bp genome containing 184 protein-coding genes. While several host bacterial genes have been incorporated into the genome of this phage, the bacterial toxin-encoding genes could not be found among these horizontally trsnsferred genes [115b]. Were the cyanobacterium a human pathogen, and the phage a carrier of the toxin-encoding genes, a system analogous to that of V. cholerae would have been identified.",

Free-living symbiodinium cells do not, but these cells in symbiosis with coral cells do activate their H+-ATPase. This 105 kDa protein works as a proton pump, dehydrates bicarbonates by carbonic anhydrase and liberates inorganic carbon. The chloroplast-encoded ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisCO) enzymes provide the fixed carbon both for the symbiont and its host [125]. Both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of the coral cell and the genome of the symbiont were sequenced. The symbiont resides in the gastrodermal cells of the coral and provides fixed carbon to these cells. The symbiotic relationship depends on the acceptance of symbiodinium sub-clade by the haplotype coral [126\u2013130]. Entry of the symbiont in a stealth manner leaves the host cell\u2019s transcriptome undisturbed. Juvenile corals are rapidly dominated by the symbiont, whereas adult or parental coral cells are less tolerant toward the symbiont. Compatible symbionts are accepted without a reaction, but incompatible symbionts massively excite the recipient\u2019s transcriptosomes [131]; The expression of metabolic genes (carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, transmembrane ion transport) is intensified in corals possessing symbiont algae [132]. Possession of the symbiont keeps the coral from senescence in that its telomere length is preserved by continuous telomerase activity [133]. Rejection of the unacceptable symbiont is carried out by caspase-activated apoptosis of the algal cells [134]. Mature corals may lose the symbionts during \u201cbleaching\u201d events. Loss of the symbionts frequently leads to the demise of coral colonies. Corals retaining the symbionts during the bleaching event survive [135]. Coral colonies attacked by Vibrio coralliilyticus undergo bleaching and die. The target of the vibrio protease is more the intracellular symbiont, than the coral tissue [136]. It is most peculiar that a coral-pathogenic vibrio (V. coralliilyticus) in the Mediterranean sea would be multiple antibiotics-resistant [137]. Antibiotic resistance genes must have evolved under natural circumstances predating with millions of years the discovery and use of penicillin: \u201cthe soil antibiotic resistomes.\u201d A transposon-induced mutant of V. coralliilyticus lost its flagellum, and with it its pathogenicity [138]. It was not reported if this vibrio harbored phages. A 81 pages, 451 references outstanding article on the biodiversity of vibrios managed not even to mention vibrio phages [139]. V. coralliilyticus infections of corals induce mass mortality in the warm Mediterranean sea [140]. Corals defend themselves against bacterial and fungal pathogens by mobilizing amoebocytes to the sites of infection [141]; the vibrio apparently bypasses these defense reactions. This mass mortality of corals was recently matched by V. cholerae in human mortality in Zimbabwe [142].",

The green alga Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus, and the coccolithovirus of Emiliania huxleyi (EhV) fit into the group of PhycoDNAviridae, the nucleocytoplasmic large dsDNA viruses. The haptophyta E. huxleyi represents one of the deepest branching lineages of the eukaryotic tree of life. Its exoskeleton displays carbonate scales, the coccoliths. The icosahedral 1,900 \u00c5 diameter chlorella virus (PBCV-1) genome encodes 365 proteins and is capable of glycosylating its major capsid proteins (without any help from the host cell\u2019s endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus). Beneath the glycoprotein capsid, lipid bilayer membrane surrounds the dsDNA core [153, 154]. The coccolithovirus EhV enters its host cell of the diploid calcified phytoplankton microalga E. huxleyi by envelope fusion and endocytosis [155]. The haploid phase of the E. huxleyi life cycle disallows viral entry and survives uninfected [156]. EhV encodes cytotoxic glycosphingolipids, which induce apoptotic death in infected cells [157]. There are seven sphingolipid biosynthetic genes (named in the article), one of them is longevity assurance factor, LAG1: wise little creature, E. huxleyi! EhV acquired these host genes via horizontal transfer; or vice versa, was it the virus that transferred these genes to its host? The virus needs lipid metabolism to construct its lipid membrane. Since lipid metabolism was present in eukaryotic cells ancestral to E. huxleyi, the direction of gene transfer was very likely from host cell to its virus [158]. The picoeukaryotic photosynthetic green alga, Ostreococcus tauri harbors a large linear dsDNA virus, OtV5, a phycodnavirus. The host cell is so small, and a virus particle is so large, that at burst only 25 virus particles can be released. One of the viral coding sequences (CDS, flanked by start and stop codons) encodes praline dehydrogenase. This stress-reactive enzyme is coming from a horizontally transferred gene, probably bacterial-to-algal-to-viral derivation [159].",

These large dsDNA viruses co-evolving not only with dinoflagellates, but with animal hosts (asfarviruses, iridoviruses, mimiviruses, mimicking microbes) acquired anti-apoptotic and immunosuppressive genes. The genes acquired from bacteria include bacteriophage genes [160, 161].

Comparable PolB genes occur in archaea viruses and in the three archaeal lineages (Nanoarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, Euryarchaeota).

Mimivirus is closely related to the large dsDNA algal viruses. The ancestral mimivirus infected microalgae of the phytoplankton. The mimiviral genome containing both DNA and RNA stands on the boundary between viruses and bacteria (or even eukaryotic protocells). Of the four mimivirus aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes, two (TyrRS; MetRS) are archaea/eukaryota-related, except for their anticodon binding sites [162]. Mimivirus-like PolB and amino acid sequences occur in algal phycodnaviruses of the Norwegian coastal waters: CeV01 (Chrisochromulina ericina), PpVo1 (Phaeocystis pouchetii) and PoV01 (Pyramimonas orientalis). The mimivirus PolB sequence exhibits 45, 41, and 31% identity with the PolB sequences of PoV01, CeV01 and PpV01. These icosahedral viruses are smaller than the mimivirus, being of 160\u2013220 nm in diameter with genome sizes of 485\u2013560 kb. For comparison, the genome of the phycodnavirus EhV-86 is 407 kb [155, 163]. In the host amoeba, the mimivirus genome is allowed to grow rather than retract. Instead of genome reduction it gains genome size by the acquisition of horizontally transferred genes and mobilomes. The viral genome enlarges within the amoeba by lineage-specific gene duplications, lateral gene transfers from the host and accretion of mobile genetic elements (transposons and retrotransposons) [164]. It was proposed that poxviruses accept host cell mRNAs reversely transcribed into cDNA, ready for integration. Among horizontally acquired poxvirus genes are those of IL-10, thymidine kinase, ribonucleotide reductase, glutathione peroxidase (for oxidative damage protection), deoxyribopyrimidine photolysase (for repair of ultraviolet light damage). The IL-10 gene in the poxvirus genome (yatapox, canarypox viruses) is the result of horizontal transfers from eukaryotic hosts [165]. Ancient poxviruses vectored retrotransposons from reptiles to mammals [166]. The amoeba is a \u201cmelting pot of genes and evolution\u201d in reference to mimivirus and the 368 kb genomic Marseillevirus residing in it [167, 168].",

Of the new proteins encoded by the mimivirus genome there are four aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Several non-coding RNAs are prominently expressed. Gene expression late promoters of the mimivirus were shared with its phage, the sputnik. Polyadenylated transcripts derived from new gene (previously unknown: no database homolog) with gene product proteins of unknown function. Mimiviral tRNA methyltransferases and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (new for a virus to encode it) are activated early. In response, a burst in the transcription of mitochondrial genes of the amoeba takes place. This event coincides with the viral \u201ceclipse phase\u201d, during which neither formed, nor functional viral elements are present in the viroplasms. The eclipse phase is followed by the upsurge of mimiviral, and the decrease of amoebal gene transcripts. For comparison, Fig. 2.1 shows the eclipse phase of influenza A virus adapted to chicken embryo, or to mouse lung (Fig. 2.1) [180]. The synthesis of the LPS-like outer layer of the viral particle is a late event. Mimiviral genes encoding capsid proteins and collagen-domain proteins are among the last to be activated [181]. The cellular nucleoside diphosphate kinases are small 150 aa proteins highly conserved within archaea, bacteria and eukaryota (>40% identity). The cellular nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDKs) do not distinguish ribonucleotides from deoxyribonucleotides, acting equally in both, transferring phosphate groups from nucleoside triphosphates (NTP, other than adenosine triphosphates, ATP) to nucleoside diphosphates (NTP to NDP). In contrast to the cellular enzymes, mimiviral NDKs display distinct affinity for deoxypyrimidine nucleotides. The mimiviral enzyme is ancestral to the cellular (including that of the amoeba) NDK enzymes. The mimiviral enzyme clusters with euryarchaeal, crenarchaeal and bacterial sequences. The Acantamoeba (A. castellani) enzyme clusters with fungal, and metazoan sequences. The viral enzyme was not acquired from a eukaryotic organism by horizontal gene transfer [182].\n",

The length of its sequenced proviral genome is in the range of 8,284 nucleotides [197]. The v-rel oncogene and its cellular homologue c-rel encode the p59v-Rel phospho-oncoprotein. The oncoprotein remains in the cytoplasm of transformed spleen cells, but in transformed E26 myeloid cells the p59v-Rel oncoprotein translocates from cytoplasm into the nucleus [198]. The natural protein Rel/NF-\u03baB is an inducer of inflammatory and immune responses, promotes cell-proliferation and it exerts anti-apoptotic effects. The viral oncoprotein transforms lymphoid cells and induces malignant tumors resembling human mediastinal B cell lymphomas and Hodgkin\u2019s disease. In the human counterparts of such tumors, overexpressed or mutated c-Rel oncoprotein activates the expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative genes in the nucleus. The vRel oncoprotein promotes the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), thus preventing the shortening of telomeres at cell divisions.",

The co-activator of activating protein-1 (AP-1) and estrogen receptors (CAPER\u03b1) is expressed in liver cirrhosis and in hepatocellular carcinoma. In vRel-mediated lymphomagenesis, CAPER\u03b1 acts as a transcriptional co-regulator and antagonist of the transforming activity of vRel oncoprotein. Neutralizing CAPER\u03b1 mRNA by siRNA in vRel-transformed lymphoma cells increased the cells malignancy, as expressed by their enhanced colony formation. Tumor suppressor CAPER\u03b1 has to be silenced by siRNA or by disabling mutation for the cRel oncoprotein to act uninhibited in human lymphoma cells. In human Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin\u2019s disease, cRel is an active oncogene. In avian malignant lymphomas transcriptional co-activation of vTAD by CAPER\u03b1 is promotional to its antagonism for vRel\u2019s transforming activity [199].

Jmj family proteins regulate both methylation and demethylation of histones (J. jumonji in Japan; ARID, AT-rich interaction domain) [201]. In chicken B cell lymphomas, REV-T induces the oncogenic miRNA-155 for targeting JARID2.

The MDV encodes oncoprotein Meq, a homologue of cellular proto-oncogenes fos and jun (fos, Finkel osteosarcoma murine retrovirus oncogene; jun, ju-nana Japanese for seventeen, after avian sarcoma virus ASV-17). MDV also encodes the immediate-early transactivator protein, ICP4, to which a small antisense RNA is expressed in lymphoma cells [204]. MDV-related abbreviations: the lytic antigen pp38 (Meq, Marek\u2019s EcoRI-Q DNA restriction one minifragment probe, Eco from Escherichia coli; pp38, phosphoprotein-38). The MDV-encoded RNA telomerase subunit (vTR) shows 88% sequence identity with the chicken gene cTR. The MDV vTR maintains telomere length in transformed cells [205]. The virus releases a number of miRNAs (similarly to Epstein-Barr virus, EBV, and HHV-8, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, KSHV). The MDV miRNAs interact with viral oncogene meq and with the viral latency associated transcript (LAT) [206]. MDV may either lay latent in avian CD4 T cells, or it malignantly transforms them. In a REV-transformed lymphoid cell line, latent MDV expressed its Meq oncoprotein antigen and contributed to the cells\u2019 apoptosis resistance. Treatment with bromodeoxyuridine induced the expression of MDV lytic antigens [207]. The Meq oncoprotein due to its Pro-Leu-Asp-Leu-Ser motif binds C-terminal binding protein (CtBP), a transcriptional co-repressor. The Meq-CtBP complex is essential for oncogenesis: cells with mutated CtBP are exempted from MEq-induced oncogenesis. The EBV oncoprotein EBNA3A/3C (nuclear antigen) also interact with CtBP. MDV vaccine strains do not encode the Meq oncoprotein and do not interact with CtBP [208].",

The two avian T cell lymphoma viruses (MDV and REV) synergized their pathogenicity, as the MDV genome accepted the insertion of the REV genome. Tumor cells co-infected with these two viruses either in vitro or in vivo, yielded MDV isolates that accepted the insertions of retroviral genomic segments in their genomes. It was the long terminal repeat (LTR) of REV that penetrated the MDV genome; both attenuated and virulent strains of MDV exhibited such insertions [217]. Herpes- and retroviruses were known to synergize their infectious and cell-transforming processes by augmenting each other\u2019s efficacy in malignant transformation [193, 218]. The Rous sarcoma virus LTR was transactivated by MDV [219]. The LTR of HIV-1 yielded to transactivation by human herpesvirus-1 (HHV-1) and other DNA viruses [220]. Vice-versa, MDV transactivated the promoters of avian leukemia and sarcoma (Rous) viruses [221, 222].",

The two avian T cell lymphoma viruses, MDV and REV, synergized their pathogenicity as the MDV genome accepts inserted segments of the REV genome [217] Transcripts of the REV\u2019s LTR promoters enhanced the expression of MDV US (unique short) genes [223, 224]. Insertions of the retroviral genome occur within one or two passages in MDV-infected cells. The retroviral insertion sites are two, 1 kb region each at the junction of the short unique and short repeat regions of the MDV genome. To the malignancy of a MDV-transformed lymphoma cell line, REV contributed the activation of the c-myb (myeloblast) proto-oncogene [225]. A clone of MDV derived through REV genomic insertion exhibited attenuated oncogenicity, but remained infectious by contact, caused thymic and bursal atrophy and induced severe immunosuppression [226]. In MDV- and REV-co-infected cells, chimeric molecules were formed from REV-LTR and MDV flanking proteins [227]. In comparing the horizontal transmissibility of MDV-GX-0101 field strain harboring the LTR of REV, LTR-deleted viral clones were more immunosuppressive and less transmissible through horizontal routes, than the original REV LTR-positive strain [228].",

It could not be distinguished if proviral REV DNA was integrated in the cells\u2019 DNA and/or into fowlpox virus DNA. The REV-contaminated fowlpox virus vaccine in inoculated chickens caused fowlpox lesions and feathering defects and proventriculitis [229]. In fowlpox virus field isolates, the integrated genomic segments of REV env gene were identified. Fowlpox virus vaccines carrying integrated REV genomic sequences induce weak protection against fowlpox [230]. In some fowlpox vaccine viruses, the full genome of REV was found integrated. These integrated REV full length genomic sequences (gag, pol, env and LTR) are replication competent [231], gag, group-associated antigens are the virions\u2019 structural proteins, pol, polymerase, encodes the viral enzymes: protease, integrase and reverse transcriptase; env, envelope proteins. REV-free field isolates of fowlpox virus (both chicken and turkey) exist. Some fowlpox virus isolates from wild birds or from poultry harbor none, or only remnants of REV LTR, and no REV env genes [232] The production of REV-free fowlpox virus vaccines is possible. A refined quantitative multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is available to select out REV-free fowlpox virus strains [233]. It is with the MDV vaccines and the fowlpox virus vaccines, where the biological importance of horizontal viral gene transfers and recombinations between unrelated viruses are surpassed by the practical urgency of the problem.",

Instead of interference with each other, herpes- and retroviruses co-operate. Their cooperation consists of either suppression of lethal infections by the partner virus in the interest of keeping the host alive; or of the activation of the other virus to gain growth factors (cytokines and chemokines), have access to transformed host cells protected against apoptotic deaths, into which to integrate, and benefit from immunosuppression of the host by creating a Th2-type environment, and thus eliminating IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 production in the host. From the human point of view, the cooperation between herpes- and retroviruses is a form of \u201ccriminal collusion\u201d [213]. The MDV increases the rate of transcription of the avian leukemia virus, Rous-sarcoma-associated retrovirus (RAV-2 ALV). Five- to tenfold RAV-2 AVL RNA and viral structural proteins are produced in the presence of MDV [221]. The phenomena of latent retrovirus activation in herpesvirally co-infected human tumor cells have been well recognized [234\u2013241]. The widely spread leukemogenic-sarcomagenic retrovirales of vertebrates from the fish up to Old World simians are not expressed in human leukemia and sarcoma cells [195, 213]. However, in herpesvirally (HHV-8; KSHV) induced human Kaposi sarcoma cells there appears an activated endogenous retrovirus (Fig. 2.3a,b) [213]. If there is a latent human sarcoma retrovirus not lost during human evolution and still is in hidden existence, it may be found in EBV-infected leiomyosarcoma cells of children [213].\n\n",

In extant descendants of Archosauria, the crocodiles and birds, the CR1-like retrotransposons are active and the encoded C-mos (vide supra) between crocodiles and birds reveal significant sequence similarity [274]. Retrovirally (avian sarcoma retrovirus) mediated gene insertions into young chickens revealed those genes that are essential to feather morphogenesis. These genes are those of the bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP) for interacting with noggin (BMP antagonists noggin and dickkopf) to induce rachis formation, barb fusion and barb branching; and for the sonic hedgehog protein (Shh) to remove by apoptosis induction marginal plate epithelial cells in between barbs [285]. Was it retrotransposons that horizontally inserted such genes into theropod dinosaurs? Were the first flights of the pterosaurs 250 million years ago bat-like or fathered bird-like? Pterosaurs were flying 150 million years before bats, and 70 million years before birds, whereas the first placental mammals appeared just over 100 million years ago. In the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary 65 million years ago, the first primates diverged from ungulates and a cataclysmic extinction of the dinosaurs occurred, but the crocodilian ancestors survived [286]. The Pan and Homo lineages separated about 7 million years ago, and Australopithecus afarensis lived 3.7 million years ago in what is Hadar, Ethiopia, today. Both birds and flying bats constricted the sizes of their genomes; retrospectively calculated (Markov chain Monte Carlo approach), pterosaurs operated with a much constricted genome [287]. Conserved genomic segmental overlaps occur between alligators, turtles, emu and chicken, despite a drastic reduction of the chickens genome size in comparison with the sizes of the reptilian genomes [288]. Even though a scrutiny of herpes- and retroviral agents active in birds, especially the Marek\u2019s virus (vide supra), so far failed to identify with exact precision the reptilian or amphibian ancestors of these avian viruses (vide infra), the descent of Aves from theropod dinosaurs is strongly supported by genetic evidence. Whether it was exclusively through a vertical line of evolution how birds emerged from reptilian ancestry, and/or was it with the help of horizontally inserted genes, it will be determined by renewed further research. May be, the answers will come from the International Chicken Genome Sequencing Consortium (Washington University School of Medicine, Campus Box 8501, 4444 Forest Park Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri 63108, USA).",

            "text": "Is there a chain of herpesviral viral evolution in which ancestral reptilian and amphibian herpesviruses (the ancestor of the fibropapillomavirus of extant turtles) (vide supra) infected the dinosaurs? Before their extinction, the dinosaurs passed these viruses to the ancestors of Aves. Extant species of Aves are infected with the descendants of these ancestral herpesviruses (gallic herpesvirus 2, the MDV; psittacine cloacal papillomatosis herpesvirus). After the divergence of the reptilian/amphibian and the mammalian lineages, the mammalian species continued to harbor the descendants of the ancient reptilian-amphibian herpesviruses (the ancestor of the fibropapillomavirus of extant turtles) and expressed them up to the simian lineages. These herpesviruses are known as the baboon, green monkey, mandril and rhesus rhadinoviruses, the retroperitoneal fibromatosis herpesviruses. These ancient rhadino-herpesviruses (herpes, erpein, creepeing-creeper; rhadino, fragile viral DNA); already encode an IL-6 homolog and their LANA (latent nuclear antigen) is an ortholog of the HHV-8/Kaposi sarcoma HV ORF73 product protein (reviewed in [213]). The anti-apoptotic LANA proteins promote cells survival and \u201cimmortalization\u201d [289]. The polymerase enzyme of the chimpanzee rhadinovirus shows 82% nucleotide sequence homology and 93% aa identity with the HHV-8/KSHV (but chimpanzees do not develop Kaposi sarcoma-like tumors) (reviewed in [213]). In KS cells HHV-8/KSHV activates the MAPK pathway (mitogen-activated kinase) [290]. The ORF (open reading frame) K12-product kaposin [291, 292], and other oncogenes of HHV-8 (v-Bcl-2; the ORF72 product v-cyclin D; the ORF74 product G-protein-coupled receptor, long unique region, cyclooxygenase-2) [293] are new acquisitions of KSHV (HHV-8), which are not yet present in the chimpanzee rhadinovirus (reviewed in [213]). In the latent form of HHV-8/KSHV, the viral genome is circularized in an epigenetic extrachromosomal location. Hypomethylation of the promoter of replication and transcription activator, and histone acetylation trigger the \u201clytic switch\u201d and thus the active replication of the virus leading to cytolysis [294]. It is not only HIV-1-induced immunosuppression that activates the latent HHV-8/KSHV The HIV-1 tat gene product transactivator protein Tat activates the MAPK pathway in the host and the kaposin gene in the latent HHV-8/KSHV [295]. Kaposi sarcoma cells through human leukocyte antigen HLA-A2 express epitopes that attract cytotoxic lymphocytes. These are aa 16\u201325 in latent antigen kaposin and aa 59\u201368 in lytic antigen glycoprotein H. The lymphocyte donors were healthy volunteers [296, 297]. This author presented microphotographs of the phenomena of cytotoxicity by autologous lymphocytes to KS sarcoma cells in the pre-AIDS era [298\u2013300]. The coexistence of the herpesviral pathogens (HHV-8/KSHV) and an as yet unidentified endogenous retrovirus in pre-AIDS era \u201cclassical\u201d KS cells is shown in Fig. 2.3a,b. The pathogenicity- and proto-oncogenes of HHV-8/KSHV very likely are host cell gene derivatives expropriated through horizontal transfers by the ancestral rhadinovirus as it was following the hominid lineage after the divergence from the Pan lineage some 7 million years ago. These horizontal new gene acquisitions by the ancestral rhadinovirus must have taken place during its residence in the ancestors of Homo (the Australopithecus afarensis and upward).",

In New World (South American) monkeys, in contrast to retroviruses dominating in Old World (African) monkeys, the lymphogenic viruses are herpesviruses [302]. Further down, in the Cambrian sea and at the time of the emergence of the ancestral sharks (Placoderms; carcharhine sharks, chondrichthyes, gnathostomata), an ancestral lymphocryptovirus might have been instrumental in inserting genes to encode the basic elements of adaptive immunity (vide infra).",

These events reflect back to the most ancient times at the origin of precellular and protocellular life, and to the forms in which predecessors of the protocells in the \u201cvirus world\u201d existed (\u201cAbiogenese der Virusarten. Eine weitere M\u00f6glichkeit der Entstehung der Virusarten ist, da\u00df sie, aus leblosen Stoffen stammend, als erste Lebewesen auf der Erde erschienen\u201d) [180]. There, RNA viruses, then retroid elements (RNA \u2192 DNA), and then DNA viruses formed sequentially. A network of interacting nucleic acids segments existed before protocells were formed [303, 304]. Viruses pre-dating the origin of and not fitting into the tree of life of the cellular living formations [307], entered the first archaea, prokaryota and eukaryota cells from the outside. Or was it ancestral cellular genomes from which the first viral nucleic acid segments excised themselves (\u201cEndogene Abstammung der Virusarten\u201d) [180]. Or was it intracellular bacterial symbionts, that through gene losses became what is now known as the lymphogranuloma inguinale virus, molluscum contagiosum virus, psittacosisvirus, trachomavirus (\u201cdie Abstammung der Viren von den Mikroben der Urzeit\u201d), whose replication by fission of large \u201cinitial bodies\u201d resembles that of pleuropneumonia bacteria, or L-forms (\u201cin Elementark\u00f6rperchen zerfallende gro\u00dfe Gebilde\u201d, \u201cPlaquebildung\u201d, \u201cMatrixmaterial\u201d?)

As the large nucleocytoplasmic dsDNA viruses are replicating in \u201cvirus factories\u201d or \u201cviroplasms\u201d exclusively in the cytoplasm (vide supra), they reactivate the idea that the first nuclei were formed in the large dsDNA virus-infected cells [308a,b, 309].",

            "text": "The rRNA studies of C. Woese aimed at the phylogenetic evolution of prokaryota lead to the discovery of archaea. Ribosomal proteins reflect backwards to the phylogenesis of the species. The universal ribosomal proteins functioned in coalesced protoplastic-spheroplastic cells prior to the separation of the phyla archaea and prokaryota. These cells exchanged large portions of their genomes by massive horizontal transfers. Speciation (\u201cthe origin of species\u201d) has taken its beginning when the first domain-specific ribosomal proteins appeared. At that point, the Darwinian threshold was established and the uncontrolled exchanges of genetic material became replaced by the rules and regulations of vertical inheritance. The 16S and 23S rRNAs established their sequence identity. Structural signatures of 16S and 23S rRNAs clearly distinguish archaea and prokaryota (bacteria), while the universal rRNA genes and proteins remain conserved and recognizable. The relative ordering of the universal r-protein genes within the rRNA gene cluster in archaea and prokaryota (bacteria) preserve their very extensive similarities, Hyperthermophilic archaea survive at 90\u00b0C. Archaea preserved their genomes by vertical inheritance, but were gene donors to prokaryota and eukaryota beneath the Darwinian threshold. The hyperthermophilic bacteria (Aquifex aeolicus; T. maritima) expropriated the archaeal genes of thermophily. The Thermus thermophilus megaplasmid is operational in Deinococcus radiodurans; if these two entities shared a common ancestor, it was through vertical inheritance, otherwise by horizontal gene transfer that they possess this megaplasmid. The archaeal stem diverged into the three lineages (Crenarchaeota, Euryarchaeota, Nanoarchaea) forming the first domain of life on the primordial Earth (prokaryota, second, and eukaryota, third). Euryarchaeota are methanogenic. The ribosomal superoperon consisting of some 50 cotranscribed and coregulated genes encoding ribosomal proteins is operational in both archaea and prokaryota. N. equitans lives as a parasite of the archaeon Ignicoccus hospitalis [319\u2013323]. In the genus of Neisseria, widely dispersed genomic clusters identical with those of other Neisseria species and other bacterial genera, suggested to Maynard Smith that the excess of horizontal gene transfers obliterated speciation and that \u201cthere are no such entities as species in these pathogenic bacteria\u201d [324, 325].",

The EMBO Conference on Molecular Microbiology, Heidelberg, 2006, discussed noncoding regulatory RNA, RNases and gene expression, genomics, evolution and bacteriophages, signal transductions, protein interactions and networks, pathogenicity, virulence and endosymbiosis, chromosome dynamics, DNA uptake, and other subject matters. These presentations were published with extensive literature quotations [328]. Here is the background and the environment in which horizontally transferred genes are released and accepted. The PLoS Genetics review specializes on those horizontal gene transfers in prokaryotes that accelerated the evolution of the recipients [329] (vide supra). One example is the lack of lysine biogenesis pathway in \u201cthe last common ancestor of life\u201d and the acquisition of this pathway by ancestors of Crenarchaeota, Deinococcus-Thermus and Pyrococcus occurred through horizontal gene transfer from prokaryota. The prokaryotic genomes evolved rapidly due to horizontally transferred genes of whatever means of transfer, other than vertical [323].",

These genes have been widely dispersed between archaea and bacteria through routes of horizontal transfers [322]. The Thermotogales genomes reflect well to events predating the Darwinian threshold. The composition of the genomes of Thermotoga maritima (Ttm) and Aquifex aeolicus (Aa) (vide supra) places them together at the base of the bacterial tree, in the era when the construction of a phylogenetic tree based on strictly vertical transmission of genes was invalidated by pervasive horizontal gene transfers. So far no prophages were found in the Ttm and Aa genomes. Some remnants of phage gene sequences in the thermotogales genome were discovered when sequences related to an E. coli phage showed up within two thermotogales genomes. Thermotogales bacteria were already armed with the antiviral related CRISPR elements (vide supra). Hyperthermophilic archaea (Thermococcales and Pyrococcus furiosus) horizontally exchanged their CRISPR elements [330]. In the absence of phages, horizontal gene transfers in thermotogales were not likely to be virally mediated. The genes securing life at high temperatures are shared with hyperthermophilic archaea. All thermotogales share closely related rRNA genes; rRNA analysis proves monophyly for Ttm and Aa. The operon for the membrane-associated proton-pump ferredoxin oxidoreductase is an archaeal feature; a derivative of it shows up in Pyrococcus furiosus. A derivative of the thermotogales ruBisCO gene, or rubisco-like proteins (vide supra) are operational in Bacillus subtilis. Derivatives of the thermotogales genes for the methionine salvage pathway are present in some deep sea bacteria. The first protocells might have been thermophilic and later life forms lost thermophily, even in some thermotogales with a change from ancestral to later 16S rRNA variations [331]. Thermotogales genomes show incongruent evolutionary history dating back to the pre-Darwinian threshold era.",

The aminoacetylated amino acids are attached to the 3\u2032-ends of cognate tRNAs. The anticodons of the aminoacyl-tRNAs specifically react with the trinucleotide codons of the mRNA. The recognition of amino acids (aa) is quite specific. The anticodon GUC for aspartate is different from anticodon GUU for asparagine in the crenarchaeon Sulfolobus [332]. These ancient enzymes converted the RNA world into the protein world. These sequences of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) evolved by gene duplications, horizontal gene transfers and genetic recombinations. It appears that some aaRS genes readily crossed between Archaea, Eubacteria (Bacteria) and Eucarya (Eukaryota). Other aaRSs are individually analyzed and their phylogeny reconstructed. Duplications, fusions, recombinations and horizontally executed exchanges of the aaRS genes exhibit great diversity. While the majority of aaRS genes can be fitted into the phylogenetic pattern of vertical transmission within the three domains of life, some individual aaRS genes defy the rules of vertical transfers. For example, the yeast mitochondrial PheRS is related to that of H. influenzae and Synecoccus [333]. Crystallographic studies of the Pyrococcus horikoshi tyrosyl-tRNA (TyrRS) and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRD) indicate that the original TyrRS was the ancestor of TrpRS in archaea, and that from archaea the TrpRS was horizontally transferred to bacteria [334].",

These microorganisms were the ancestors of cyanobacteria already practicing anoxygenic photosynthesis. Their reaction center 1 (RS1) reduced nicotinamid adenine dinucleotide phosphorylated (NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H. In starvation these cells fixed nitrogen. Upon acquisition of photosystem II (PSII) and RS2 (able to oxidize water) over the pre-existing PSI and RS1, these procyanobacteria transgressed the Darwinian threshold and evolved into oxygenic photosynthesis conducting extant cyanobacteria. Cyanobacterial photosynthetic genes (gene clusters and gene product proteins, the core cyanobacterial clusters of orthologous groups of proteins, core CyOGs) spread either by horizontal transfers in the contemporaneous living world: into the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium tepidum, the green nonsulfur bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus, the Gram-positive phototrophic bacterium firmicute Heliobacillus mobilis, and the purple \u03b1-proteobacteriun Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Endosymbiotic cyanobacteria in plastid-carrying eukaryotes, the apicomplexans, the vestigial plastid-carriers (Plasmodium falciparum), diatoms (Thalassiosira psudonana), and algae (Cyanidioschyzon merolae), and from algae transferring eventually into plants occupying dry land (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, etc), propagated further the chlorophyll- and phycobilin-based photosynthetic genome. Protective chlorophyll-binding proteins dissipate excess light energy and thus secured the survival of cyanobacteria [336, 337].",

The myo- and podoviruses propagated their structural genes to T4/T7 coliphages. In addition, these Prochlorococcus phages carry cyanobacterial photosynthesis genes. In contrast, the siphovirus lacks the cyanobacterial photosynthetic genes, but exhibits 14 other cyanobacterial homologue genes. Lytic cyanobacterial phages replicate in the bacterium and egress by bursting it. Temperate phages insert their DNA genome into the host bacterial chromosome and as prophages replicate with the host genome. Temperate phages carry out horizontal gene transfers, including those genes that encode pathogenicity islands and toxin genes (vide infra). However, most cyanobacterial isolates are devoid of prophages (and pathogenicity islands and toxins) [338, 339]. Cyanobacteria of the genus Synecoccus are infected by the phage, cyanomyovirus S-PM32. This phage shares some of its structural proteins with coliphage T4, its other structural proteins are unique and unrelated to other phages [340]. Phage homing endonucleases encoded by the endonuclease genes perform site-specific DNA cleavage. The cyanobacteriophage S-PM2 endonuclease is homologous to the resolvase of coliphage T4. Group I introns (inteins) can disrupt the DNA recognition site of the endonuclease. Otherwise the endonuclease makes a specific double strand cut of the DNA. The endonuclease can not cleave the introns-containing core photosynthesis reaction center gene (psbA). Mobile introns in the same target sequence that the endonuclease attacks, protects the host cell genome. Collaborative homing introns protected the photosynthetic genes [341].",

Some archaeal prophages (Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus in a crenarchaeal host; and others integrated into the tRNA of euryarchaeal hosts) are the ancestors of eukaryotic adenoviruses [343]. While temperate phages are accepted, even welcome for the useful genes they might insert, lytic phages are opposed for the life of the host. In this most ancestral virus-host relationship, the host genomes arranged the clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), the small RNA-guided defense system in archaea and prokaryota. The system prevails in eukaryotic genomes as well. Halophilic archaea defended themselves against lytic phages by a highly conserved CRISPR mechanism [344]. The first use of this defensive system must have occurred beneath the Darwinian threshold. In prokaryota the use of the system transgressed the threshold [345\u2013348]. Bypassing vertical inheritance, the valuable gene clusters of the CRISPR system were acquired by horizontal transfers mediated by phages and plasmids [349]. Beyond the Darwinian threshold, prokaryotic genera widely accepted the horizontal transfer of, and applied the CRISPR defensive system against phages and plasmids, including the universal cas 1 gene. Same in eukaryotic cells, the system targets the nucleic acid of the invaders in a sequence-specific manner. In response, point-mutated viral genomic sequences escape recognition by the CRISPR system; a massive viral invasion of a cell could overwhelm the CRISPR system [350].",

The uropathogenic E. coli acquires its pathogenicity island genes (fimbria, adhesins, LPS, toxins, hemolysins, siderophores) through horizontal transfer and in its biofilms and within bacteria-loaded epithelial cells it commonly overcomes both innate and adaptive immune reactions of the host [354, 355]. In the Netherlands, Enterobacter strains (E. cloacae, E. hormaechei) may be one of the sources of the pathogenicity island genes of uropathogenic E. coli strains [51] (vide supra). The high pathogenicity island (HPI) gene cluster may be transferred also to Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. Yersiniabactin (from Y. pseudotuberculosis) is such a HPI. The HPIs contain integrases, an iron uptake system (a catecholate siderophore) and an integrative and a conjugative element (ICE) with genes producing enzymes for excision and integration for DNA conjugative transfer. Some ICEs do, others do not contain helicase encoding DNA [51]. In Hungary, Klebsiella pneumoniae strains acquired plasmids up to 230 kb in size. The ciprofloxacin-resistant VTX-M-15-producing K. pneumoniae strains (VTX, from verocytotoxigenic E. coli) spread in an epidemic fashion in six nosocomial outbreaks [356]. In Galveston, TX, fluoroquinolin-resistant uropathogen E. coli emerged to infect renal transplant patients; these \u201cvirulent appearing\u201d E. coli strains remained susceptible to 3rd generation cephalosporins [357]. The EMBO conference on prokaryotic genomic evolution and gene expressions [328], dealt with the noncoding regulatory RNAs of E. coli, one of which, a sRNA, suppresses the synthesis of toxic peptides [358]. Could this mechanism neutralize toxin production in a HPI?",

M. marinum possesses a 6,636,827-bp circular chromosome with 5,426 coding sequences of which 23 are nonribosomal peptide synthases and 18 are of unknown function and without orthologous genes in other mycobacteria. The early secreted exported antigenic targets (ESX1-6; SX-A/B; ESAT) ATP-dependent system is encoded from 29 esx genes; this gene number is reduced to 23 in M. tuberculosis. The ESX expressions relate to virulence, intercellular spread, induction of granuloma formation and to the ability to grow in vitro. The ESX proteins activate inflammasomes through induction of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 secretion. The ESX-5 protein suppresses the production of IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6. The mel2 locus (mel loci confer enhanced infection; mrl loci confer repressed infection) encodes proteins protecting M. marinum in infected macrophages from reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species (ROS; RNS). Bacterial cell wall lipooligosaccharides suppress TNF\u03b1 production in infected macrophages. These data derive from M. marinum-infected mouse and human macrophages, not from infected fish [367\u2013370]. M. marinum harbors the genomes of 10 prophages, and a 23-kb mercury-resistance plasmid. Some of the large repertoire of non-ribosomal peptid synthase genes of M. marinum were acquired horizontally. M. marinum and M. tuberculosis share 3,000 orthologs with amino acids identity of 85%. The large genome of M. marinum provides for its extensive host range and its ability to survive in its aquatic environment. The downsized genome of M. tuberculosis restricts its host range; it is adequate for its intracellular life style; the acceptance of horizontally acquired genes provides for its survival in an immunologically active host [371]. There are 695 coding sequences (CDS) present in M. marium and missing from M. tuberculosis. Of the remaining CDS, 80% are orthologs between M. marinum and M. tuberculosis. Native M. marinum, the causative agent of fish tank granuloma in the human host, can be eliminated by healing and can be effectively treated with antibiotics (rifampin, ethambutol, clarythromycin and others). This author wonders if patients with healed fish tank granulomas acquire some immunity against M. tuberculosis?",

BCG Tokyo retained its full size of 4,371,711 bp containing 4,033 genes, of which 3,950 encode proteins. Retention versus losses of the original genes varies in the foreign passage lines of BCG strains. For example, BCG Tokyo/Japan retained its trehalose 6,6\u2032dimycolate (TDM) production, and thus induces strong IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 response, whereas the BCG Connaught lost parts of its TDM production and therefore is a weak inducer of Th1-type immune reactivity. In India, weak cytokine-inducer BCG treatment of bladder cancer resulted in higher rates of relapses. Some BCG strains induce more the tolerizing cytokine IL-10, than the Th1-type cytokine IFN-\u03b3 [383\u2013387]. A mutated narK2X promoter in its 110 region deprives M. bovis of the nitrate reductase enzyme. This enzyme in M. tuberculosis is vital for bacterial survival under hypoxic/anaerobic conditions, which prevail within granulomata [388], thus reducing BCG\u2019s pathogenicity. Horizontal gene implants (perfringolysin; MUC1 mucin and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, GM-CSF) into the genome of BCG strains intensifies the vaccines immunogenicity [389, 390]. The multiple drug-resistant Beijing M. tuberculosis strain emerged as \u201can evolutionary response to BCG vaccination against, and antibiotic therapy for\u201d tuberculosis [391]. Ancient records of paleopathology reveal that human tuberculosis predated that of domesticated animals (bovine tuberculosis) [392] Tuberculosis decimated mankind 35,000 years ago (or much longer).",

The same entry site is used by some arena viruses (Lassa virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus). The Schwann cell invaded by M. leprae either dies in apoptosis, or proliferates. Cell proliferation is induced by the activated p56Lck (lymphoid cell kinase), a Rous sarcoma virus-related kinase (src) gene-product proteins. In surviving Schwann cells, NF\u03baB translocates into the nucleus. These cells release solubilized receptors of TNF-\u03b1, but infected myelinating Schwann cell can not produce myelin. If myelin protein P0 (Pzero) is produced, M. leprae binds to it [393]. Activated macrophages surround the lesions and phagocytose, but fail to kill the bacteria. In Lucio\u2019s phenomenon, extensive vascular endothelial cell necrosis occurs, numerous skin ulcers develop and contain large foamy macrophages loaded with bacteria (M. leprae). Leprosy becomes a chronic ailment in patients with Th2-type immune reactions (producing IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2). Patients with lepromatous leprosy generate regulatory T cells (Tregs) suppressing Th1-type immune reactions (reviewed in [213]). The intracellular NOD system (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain) activates the first innate immune reaction in the host; single nucleotide polymorphisms render the NOD system deficient, increase the susceptibility upon exposure and direct the disease to advance into the multibacillary stage instead of the paucibacillary stage [394]. Lectins of M. leprae and M. tuberculosis activate in DCs the signaling pathway of proto-oncogene raf-1 (rat fibrosarcoma) and the Raf-1 protein acetylates NF\u03baB subunit p65 after NF\u03baB was already induced IL-10-mediated Th-2 type environment [395]. Thus, M. leprae activates proto-oncogenes (src-p56lck, raf-1) to induce host cell proliferation, or host immunosuppression, but without malignant transformation of the invaded cells.",

Single nucleotide polymorphisms were interpreted as resistance to gene mutations and to horizontal gene insertions. Variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) distinguishes four genotypes of M leprae based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) [399]. While M. leprae lacks the ability to grow in laboratory media, it can infect the nine-banded armadillos in the Southeastern USA from Texas to Florida [400]. In the laboratory M. leprae can be grown in the foot pads of nude rats. M. leprae DNA/RNA extracted from such tissues so far did not reveal the acquisition of host cell genes; instead, M. leprae eliminated many of its resident genes by silencing them, and converting them to nonprotein encoding pseudogenes. Patients with leprosy yield large numbers of bacteria from their nasal smears. The M leprosy genome contains 1,514 ORFs and 1,133 pseudogenes; the M. tuberculosis genome contains 278 pseudogenes [401, 402].",

Chemokines and cytokines work with the Toll-like signaling receptors, while it is not clear just exactly when the first alpha-beta interferons (IFN-\u03b1\u03b2) were produced. Humoral immunity was, and still is, practiced in the lamprey and hagfish by the generation of antigen-reactive leucine-rich repeats in the variable lymphocyte receptors. The variable lymphocyte receptors (VLR) are hypervariable and occupy the concave surface of the structure. The secreted hypervariable receptors appear in dimers, tetramers and pentamers to bind highly specifically the targeted antigens in the extracellular spaces [424\u2013427]. In cyclostomata fish (hagfish and lamprey), the VLR gene-carrier lymphoid cells undergo clonal expansion in response to antigenic stimulation, and encode a great diversity of leucine-rich repeats (LRR), which react with different antigens. The LRRs are not immunoglobulins.",

One of the basic doctrines of the adaptive immune system is the preservation of the faculties of the entire innate immune system and cooperation with them in a mutually dependent fashion. This principle manifests itself best in the fundamental functions of the innate dendritic cells and natural killer (NK) cells in the adaptive immune system. Inhibitory NK cell receptors recognize the self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and the NK cell remains silent. Cells with downregulated MHC molecules (virally infected cells; malignantly transformed cells) are recognized by the killer receptors (KIR) of NK cells and are attacked. In mammals, inhibitory and killer NK cell receptors are encoded from different chromosomes. Human KIRs are encoded from the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) of genes [428]. In the adaptive immune system, histocompatibility antigens are recognized; antigen-presenting cells educate T lymphocytes for the induction of Th1-, Th2-, Th17-type inner immune environment in the host. The most intricate specific antibody production (immunoglobulins, Igs) by B (bursal) lymphocytes maturing into plasma cells is the exclusive property of the adaptive immune system. T lymphocytes release most of the interleukins and cytokines; B lymphocytes through processes of somatic hypermutations construct the antigen-specific light chains of the immunoglobulin molecules. See original research [429\u2013431] and reviews [431, 213].",

However, in the sea urchin, rag1 and rag2 already co-exist with the zink finger domain in rag1 fully operational. Some innate immunological function is assigned to RAG1,2 in the sea urchin, inasmuch as these gene product proteins are expressed in coelemocytes, the sea urchin\u2019s defensive cells. Coelomocytes respond to LPSs. The responding coelomocyte receptors 185/333 are capable of nucleotide sequence variations as the 185/333 genes encode similar proteins, but with a high level of sequence diversity [437]. These are the first immunological diversity (D) responses so far recorded (but these proteins are not immunoglobulins). Sea urchin coelomocytes also express the vertebrate complement components B and C3; these opsonize targets for phagocytic engulfment. In contrast, all other elements of the adaptive immune system are absent in sea urchins: there are no lymphocytes, no immunoglobulins and no B or T cell receptors. Crystallographic studies show structure similarities between sea urchin and vertebrate RAG1, 2. These findings may be interpreted so, that the rag1, 2 sequences were not newly inserted into the ancestors of he sharks, they might have been acquired at the sea urchin level. However, evolutionary inheritance lines in one direction toward echinodermata and the other line toward cartilaginous fish (chondrichthyes) diverged 400 million years ago.",

The transposon N-RAG-TP of the sea slug (mollusk) Aplysia californica encodes a protein with its N terminal part being similar to that of the vertebral RAG protein. Transposon N-RAG is distinct from the transposons transib of other invertebrate species. The other transposon, similar to rag1 is transposon Chapaev [437]. Some bacterial integrases are related to rag gene product proteins. The inverted repeat structure and the left/right asymmetry of the RSS elements are like the end structures of terminal repeats of the insertion sequences in bacterial genomes, when mobile DNAs encode transposases. A rag gene passage from Bacteroides to Porphyromonas has just recently been recognized [440]. The recombination of RSS-flanked DNA sequences is brought about by the rag gene pair encoding recombinases. These recombinases excise the RSS-flanked DNA and catalyze its transposition in a \u201ccut and paste\u201d manner. The rag1 and rag2 genes have a tight genomic linkage. Probably they had to travel together. The structure of the rag2 gene differs from that of the rag1 gene. The rag2 is a eukaryotic gene. RAG2 may be an activator of RAG1. Indeed, RAG2 switches the catalytic center of RAG1 into its active conformation [441, 442].",

The whole genome duplications one and two of the vertebrate genomes occurred in the common ancestor of all vertebrates after the appearance of urochordates and before the out-branching radiations of the jawed vertebrates [446]. The amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae) contains only one MHC-like region and no class I and II genes (the proto-MHC), whereas from the cartilaginous fish upward to mammals, MHCs are represented by large clusters of gene families [447, 448]. The predecessor NK cell receptor and leukocyte receptor genes were already represented in the proto-MHC. Endogenous intronic retroviruses persist within the gene clusters of human MHC class II, as remnants of prior proviral DNA insertions. In multigenic regions (as in MHC gene clusters) these retroviral DNA insertions promote the generation of diversity [449].",

Then, from the placoderms to cartilaginous fish (sharks), bony fish, amphibians, reptiles, the extinct dinosaurs, birds and mammals, not in a straight line, but in several divergences, another second adaptive immune system emerges. The first adaptive immune system culminated its course in cyclostomata fish (agnatha), but without B and T lymphocytes, no immunoglobulins and without antigen presentation in the grooves of MHC molecules. If genetically re-arranged antigen receptors are the first signs of adaptive immunity, these appear firmly installed in cyclostomata. If the sea urchin coelomocytes posses such a receptor (vide supra), then echinodermata exhibited the first sign of direction of development from innate toward adaptive immunity. Echinodermata appear to have possessed in their germ line the rag2 element to which through horizontal gene insertion the rag1 element joined. The donor of the rag1 element might have been a prokaryota, and its vector a transposon [450, 451]. Indeed, the inverted RSS repeats are like those of a transposon. From sea urchins to sharks, from fish to mammals, the span of evolution is estimated to be close to 900 million years. The span from first cartilaginous fish to mammals is placed at approximately 500 million years. If the distance in time is some 3 billion years from prokaryotes to mammals, then the rag1 gene is a champion biological space traveler.",

As to solid tumors, EBV is active in Chinese lymphoepitheliomas, co-infects with human papillomaviruses nasopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, detectable in Japanese stomach adenocarcinomas, and probably co-pathogenic in childhood leiomyosarcomas. In many pathological entities (SLE, multiple sclerosis, malignant lymphomas), EBV co-exists with reactivated latent endogenous retroviruses, or with the pathogenic retrolentivirus, human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). Association of EBV with these pathological entities has been repeatedly reviewed, biochemically documented [452, 453] and illustrated [213]. One of the most significant biochemical documentations consists of the interactions of EBV gene product proteins BZLF-1 with crucial pro- and anti-apoptotic cellular elements, p53 and NF\u03baB (and the common, but by now diverged evolutionary lineage of p53 and NF\u03baB is also well documented) [454\u2013458].",

Thus EBV BALF-2 gene product proteins could interact with the V(D)J recombination process [460] The presence of a rag-1-like sequence in EBV genome may be the remnant of an ancient acquisition. A scenario can be envisioned in which the ancestor deuterostomes at an early stage of the line that led to sea urchins, acquired a rag1-like sequence from prokaryotes and carried that gene in their germ lines inserted next to their genuine eukaryotic rag2 gene. That RAG1/RAG2 complex did not interact with the V(D)J gene cluster, which is non-existent in the echinodermata genomes. As sea urchins and placoderms coexisted in the post-cambrian sea, a herpesvirus infecting the echinoderm sea urchins might have excised the rag1 gene from its host\u2019s genome and incorporated it into its own viral genome. Host gene acquisition by herpes (and other) viruses has been and remains a common practice referred to as gene drain, usurping and expropriating host cell genes. The deuterostome lines leading to echinoderms (sea urchins) and sharks (placoderms, carcharine sharks; gnathostomata chondrichthyes) diverged into these two directions hundreds of million years earlier, but preserved the germline rag2 gene. The herpesvirus, a probable ancestor of extant EBV and carrier of the rag1 gene, infected the placoderms and/or carcharine sharks and inserted into their germ line the rag1 sequences. There the rag1rag2 genes encoded their gene product proteins the RAG1/RAG2 recombinase-mediating enzymes interacting with the V(D)J and RSS complexes. Were the V(D)J RSS complexes arriving into the same hosts from other sources (as transposons)? The G/C content of the termini (terminal repeats, TR) of the EBV genome is enriched up to 70%, like the V(D)J RSS A/T rich nonamer region. One of the EBV TR nonamer sequences is adjacent 5\u2032 to a sequence with V(D)J RSS similarity. In this aspect EBV termini resemble transposon termini. The intracellular herpesviral genomes are either circular in latent episomal position, or replicative linear form inserted in the host cell\u2019s genome. The transition of the herpesviral genome from circular to linear form is initiated by transcription factor BZLF-1 gene product protein. In EBV\u2019s replication cycle sequences resembling V(D)J RSS are produced [460].",

            "text": "Adjacent to EBV\u2019s DNA-binding protein, the product of EBV gene BALF-2, lie response elements AP-1 and SP-1 (activating protein-1; specificity protein). AP-1 is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and migration and it interacts with the jun proto-oncogene (vide supra) [461]. The jun proto-oncogene disallows cell survival in the autophagic state under distress; it induces apoptotic death of autophagic cells [462]. The SP transcription factors regulate those genes that encode neo-angiogenesis factors, and invasiveness of malignantly transformed cells. When the SP factors active in tumor cells (ovarian carcinoma; pancreatic carcinoma) are targeted with antibiotics (mithramycin and its derivatives) or with chemotherapeuticals, overexpressed SP-1 becomes downregulated with cessation of tumor growth resulting [463, 464]. Both AP-1 and SP-1 interact with the RAG proteins, probably indirectly by elevating cyclic AMP. The binding sites of the EBV BZLF-1 protein are similar to those of AP1; these binding sites are located within 2 kb of the BALF-2 ORF. EBV infection of T lymphocytes results in a robust stimulation of RAG activity. The structures of the RAG1 and EBV\u2019s DBP show similarity in their N-terminal regulatory domain and in their C-terminal DNA-binding domain. Both proteins display Mg2+-dependent DDE residues (vide supra). Both proteins express a zink finger in similar regions. This suggests that these two proteins descended from a common ancestor proto-RAG recombinase, imitating a transib insertion (but for proof more primary sequence similarity would be required). Dreyfus concludes that insertions of DDE recombinase of ancient herpesviral origin occurred adjacent to primordial rag2 genes in ancestors of sea urchins or in ancient sharks and the remnants of this RAG1 protein are still expressed in the BALF-2 protein and its promoter in extant EBV particles [460].",

Since structural and functional similarity is evident between the RAG and DDE/RNase H family nucleases and the dimethyl arginine argonaute protein component of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), such sequences may serve within the defensive mechanisms of the virus within its host cell. Both RAG1 and RISC enzymes utilize Mg2+ ions at their DDE site, as another herpesviral DNA-binding protein, infected cell protein-8 (ICP-8). Argonaute and RISC are RNA-silencing elements; argonaute was operational in archaea (Thermus thermophilus). The argonaute gene family members underwent extensive horizontal transfers from Aquifex aeolicus through archaea and eukaryota [465]. The targets of RISC and argonaute are double-stranded mRNAs. Both EBV and HHV-8 (Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus) produce large numbers of micro-RNAs (miRNA). The targets of viral miRNAs and interfering RNAs (iRNA; RNAi) are the ds mRNAs translating host cell proteins that are encoded for anti-viral defense. Viral miRNAs form complexes with RISC and argonaute in order to effectively attack targeted ds mRNAs. The small regulatory RNAs (sRNA) are small interfering siRNAs, miRNAs, and piRNAs (pi, piwi, P-element-induced wimpy testis discovered in infertile males of drosophila and mouse colonies). PIWI-RNAs protect the germline genome by eliminating alien retrotransposons of invasive intent [466\u2013471].",

In 1885 in Saxony, Germany, next to the township Borna, the German cavalry lost many horses to a disease of unknown causation (\u201cals Verursacher einer t\u00f6dlichen Hirnerkrankung bei Pferden\u201d). Intranuclear eosinophilic Joest-Degen inclusion bodies in brain cells of horses afflicted with the disease [473], lymphocytic infiltrates of involved brain tissue, and transferability of the disease with cell free extracts to rabbits, rats and mice strongly suggested a viral causative agent for Borna disease. The causative agent was replicated in tissue cultures including human cells. The Borna disease virus (BDV) was identified as a ssRNA virus consisting of 8,910 bp; it is a unique member of the Mononegavirales group, which possess an RNA genome with a sequence opposite to a mRNA. The viral nucleoprotein gene encodes a viral structural protein for the packaging of the viral RNA genome in the nucleocapsid. BDV is not explicitly cytopathic as infected cell may survive, but the immune reaction thus elicited may kill infected cells (\u201cBDV verursacht die Bornasche Krankheit, eine virus-induzierte, immunvermittelte Entz\u00fcndungsreaktion des zentralen Nervensystems\u201d). In addition to horses, the pathogenicity of BDV is quite broad, both by experimental transfer of the disease to rabbits, rats, mice (rat brain virus transferred by intracerebral injection into newborn mice) [474], tree shrews, cats, rhesus monkeys, and by its natural infections through unknown routes to sheep, birds (from psittacine birds to ostriches) and to human patients (\u201cvom Tier auf den Menschen \u00fcbertragbare Erkrankung\u201d). The first proposal that BDV infects human beings and that it causes neuro-psychiatric disorders was entirely unacceptable to learned retrovirologists of the highest rank. The laboratory documents that anti-BDV antibodies and antibody-virus antigen immune complexes have been identified in the blood of patients with neuro-psychiatric disorders (\u201cdass Menschen Antik\u00f6rper haben k\u00f6nnen\u201d) were rejected as experimentally erroneous and thus unacceptable (unconfirmable). The authors of such publications were silenced (ordered to refrain from such publications and lectures) by executive orders from the institute director. However, the laboratory documentation of antibody production in human patients with neuro-psychiatric disorders was repeatedly confirmed by independent investigators and on occasions BDV isolates from human patients were reported. The German Institute of Laboratory Medicine held a conference in Berlin in January 2008 on BDV infections in animals and in human patients and published the material of the entire conference in the Acta Pathologica Microbiologica et Immunologica Scandinavica in 2008 [473]. In this volume, B. Norrild, the author of the Introduction, and H. Ludwig, the author of the Epilog refer to the authoritativeness of the institute director declaring that such dictatorial orders are peremptory to the freedom of medical research (cited in [473]). The author (L. Bode), who was ordered to refrain from presenting data from her laboratory and clinics concerning the human pathogenicity of BDV, spoke at the congress under the protection of a disclaimer: \u201cthis article reflects the author\u2019s but not the institutions opinion\u201d (cited in [473]). This valuable volume discusses the biology of bornavirus (H. Ludwig, pp. 14\u201320), the neuropathology and pathogenesis of bornavirus diseases (G. Gosztonyi, pp. 53\u201357); other authors\u2019 presentations concern the worldwide distribution of bornavirus diseases from Scandinavia to Australia and Japan, and very extensively the human pathogenicity of the disease in children and adults (cited in [473]).",

            "text": "It has now been firmly established that the non-segmented, negative sense ssRNA BDV establishes a persistent infection in brain cells preferring for its host cells those residing in the limbic systems of the brain. In mammalian brain cell nuclei even without active viral replication, sequences of the viral nucleoprotein (N) gene may persist. These are endogenous borna-like N elements (EBLN) inscribed in the germ line genome of the cells. Some EBLN elements display ORFs and their mRNAs; thus, the sequences may encode proteins of unknown physiological function in their hosts. The human EBLNs express ORFs suggestive of protein encoding capacity. Could this activity be psychogenic-pathopsychogenic in the human brain? Several ancient insertional events for EBLNs can be detected in the genomes of mammalian cells beginning in primates, dating back to pre-human hosts (40 million years ago), and in squirrels with more recent (10 million years ago) acquisition. Some EBLNs lost sequences and exist as inert pseudogenes. The in vivo events of natural insertion of EBLN elements into the genome of brain cell nuclei could be duplicated in vitro in tissue cultures of human cells infected with BDV [489]. These authors state: \u201cOur results provide the first evidence for endogenization of non-retroviral virus-derived elements in mammalian genomes\u2026\u201d [489]. However, the genome of the exogenous negative sense ssRNA virus, the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus of the Arenavirus class, performed an illegitimate recombination event with the genome of the endogenous intracisternal A-type retrotransposon, which reverse-transcribed the entire recombined genome of both viruses into a cDNA and integrated it into the host cell\u2019s genome [490]. Thus, most anything can happen between viruses co-infecting a host cell. The BDV intragenomic sequences are retropositioned probably by LINEs (long interspersed nucleotide element); LINEs are mobile DNA elements (their RNA retrotranscribed into DNA) that copy themselves and excise and reinsert themselves in host cell genomes. Promiscuous LINEs can act upon non-self LINE templates [491]. and being especially hyperactive in the human brain [492], possibly can retrotranscribe BDV RNA into a DNA strand [493]. Further, non-retroviral RNA viruses, the dsRNA totiviridae, are able to horizontally transfer and integrate their genomes into fungi (candida, penicillium, uromyces) [494] (vide infra).",

HHV-6 is an ancient human herpesvirus; its genome is the closest to the human progenitor herpesviruses [495]. HHV-6AB are closely related to human CMV and HHV-7 [496]. The overall nucleotide sequence identity of HHV-6A and HHV-6B is 90%. HHV-6AB, especially HHV-6A, are opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised patients. While HHV-6B causes exanthem subitum (Roseolavirus) in children, HHV-6AB association with Stevens-Johnson\u2019s syndrome or with Langerhans cell histiocytosis [497, 498] does not prove etiological role of these viruses in these pathological entities. HHV-6AB act as co-factors in lymphomagenesis (including Hodgkin\u2019s disease) and in the etiology of multiple sclerosis. Indeed, HHV-6 co-infects CD4 T lymphocytes and promotes HIV-1 replication in AIDS [499]. A HHV-6 genomic sequence encodes a 490 aa polypeptide REP protein), which is homologous to the human adeno-associated virus type-2 (AAV-2) rep (replication) gene product protein. This gene in HHV-6 probably was horizontally acquired in a eukaryotic host cell co-infected by both HHV-6 and AAV-2. In such an association, HHV-6 mediates the replication of the helper virus-dependent parvovirus AAV-2 [500, 501]. A 1,473 bp genomic sequence of HHV-6A encodes the transformation suppressor protein (ts \u2192 TS). The TS displays 24% identity and 51% similarity to the Rep protein of AAV-2. Both HHV-6A TS and AAV-2 REP suppressed Harvey-ras gene-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 cells, but not when ras-mutated Finkel murine osteosarcoma retrovirus induced sarcomagenesis. When tested against HIV-1 LTR promoter, REP and TS inhibited it, but the retrolentiviral transactivator response (TAR) element reversed the inhibition [502].",

Transmission of integrated HHV-6 genomic segments from parent to child by vertical inheritance was reported [506]. The chromosomally integrated and vertically transmitted HHV-6 genome is present in every cell of the body. In a most peculiar way, the HHV-6 genomic segments integrate most frequently within the telomere region of the targeted chromosome. These ribonucleoprotein (reverse transcriptase) holoenzymes maintain the telomere lengths of chromosomes. HHV-6 integration sites were 9q34.3, 10q26.3, 11p15.5, 17p13.3 and 19q13.4. Integration actually within chromosome was best documented for the 9q34.3 site [507]. In sequencing the HHV-6A genomic integration sites in patients with families of integrated and inherited HHV-6, at chromosomal sites 17p13.3, 18q23, and 22q13.3, the telomeric repeats TTAGGG were found to be the integration loci. In chromosomes with integrated HHV-6A genomic sequences, no circular episomal viral genomes were found and the integrated viral genomes could be chemically activated to replicate [508]. Patients harboring integrated HHV-6 genomic segments become immunosuppressed, when latent viral genomes switch to replicative state. HHV-6 not only attacks lymphocytes representing adaptive immunity, it also blocks signaling from TLRs. In HHV-6-infected DCs, LPS-stimulated TLR4 do not generate immune reactivity [509].",

The first chimeric eukaryotes built their nucleus, cytoskeleton and locomotion (cilia) from horizontally acquiesced donated genes [513\u2013516]. However, it might not have been acquiescence from the part of LECA in tacitly complying with the invasion of its genome by exogenous genes. It might have been a voracious engulfment of alien genes and genomes for the achievement of superiority over other cells in competition for niche and nutrients. LECA was a \u201cconscious cell\u201d with microtubules that were evolving into neurotubules [517, 518]. Beneath the Darwinian threshold (vide supra) widespread distributions and exchanges of archaeal and prokaryotic/eubacterial genes occurred admixed with vertical inheritance. The repeated lateral transfers of the archaeal reverse gyrase into thermophilic bacteria (Thermotogales; Aquificales) by plasmids and transposases [519] exemplifies the promiscuous life style of the early proto-spheroplasts. The era of speciation above the Darwinian threshold favored the events of organelle acquisition by endosymbiosis.

The eukaryotic organelles, plastids, derived from cyanobacteria through endosymbiosis, as protists captured and engulfed green and red algae. The early eukaryota experienced primary, secondary and tertiary endosymbiotic events resulting in the horizontal movements of the plastids. Most of the plastid genes ended up in the nuclei of the host cells [524, 525]. The apicoplasts, the remnants of engulfed red algae, remain either as relics, or as functional chloroplast-like organelles in some apicomlexan unicellular eukaryotic parasites (Eimeria, Plasmodia, Theileria, Toxoplasma sp.). Ciliates diverged into dinoflagellates and apicomplexan parasites. Plasmodia at one time possessed both chloroplasts and mitochondria, both much reduced in size and function in the extant host. In P. falciparum proteins encoded in the nucleus (endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degrading enzymes) communicate with the apicoplast [526\u2013528]. Both plasmodia and toxoplasma express special nuclear genes (pfprex) to encode proteins (DNA helicase, polymerase and primase) with affinity to the apicoplast. In response, the apicoplast contributes encoded proteins to host cell metabolism (the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex). The plasmodium apicoplast gene tufA encodes a translation elongation factor (EF-Tu), which, however, renders the red cell-parasite host susceptible to the chemotherapeutic drug thiostrepton [529\u2013531]. The presence of horizontally transferred genes of mitochondrial origin within apicoplasts strongly suggests that these two organelles of the same host cell co-operate in the interest of their host [532].",

            "text": "First, parasitic chlamydiae gained genes of important enzymes from free-living actinobacteria [533\u2013535]. Then, the transferosomes of chlamydiae transferred genes through the routes of \u201cendosymbiotic gene transfer\u201d to their unicellular eukaryotic hosts [536]. This paper gives a spectacular view of the details of this ancient association. Among the laterally acquired gene winners are human parasites (entameba, trichomonas) and the free-living amoeba, Dictyostelium [537\u2013539]. Some horizontally transferred genes travel via transposons, \u201cthe most abundant, most ubiquitous genes in nature\u201d [540]. Marine invertebrate crustaceans yield some of the most ancient mariner-like elements (transposons); for example the Bytmar1 transposon in the hydrothermal crab Bythograea [541]. Some transposons find their way to the nucleus with the help of (attachment to) DNA-binding proteins [542]; some are transferred by viruses or plasmids (by phages in bacteria and by their descendants, all the eukaryotic viruses). Cyanophages (cyanomyovirus related to T4 coliphage) operate with 64 genes. Of these, there is a highly conserved hyperplastic region containing inserted genes of host cell-like sequences encoding enzymes (plastoquinol, plastocyanin, 6-phosphogluconate and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase) [543]. The Rhodothermus marinus RM378 phage encodes a polynucleotide kinase with some sequence similarities to the same enzyme of coliphage T4. These enzymes work to counter the anti-phage miRNA defense of the bacterial hosts [544]. The T4 coliphage (phi1) encapsidates small circular host cell DNAs for horizontal transfer to new host cells [545]. Even rickettsiae release plasmids to communicate with their host cell, ranging from those of arthropod vectors to that of mammalian hosts [546].",

Protochordate ascidian larvae utilize cellulose synthetases (CesA) of prokaryotic origin for the formation of the long cellulose fibrils along the larval tail. In CesA knockout larvae, the notochord cells were misaligned and the tail failed to elongate. The CesA gene was inserted from a prokaryotic donor into the early lineage of the tunicates. Extracellular cellulose microfibrils started the morphogenesis of the notochord and tail in the larvae of Oikopleura dioica [548].",

These fungal species horizontally acquired genes from oomycetes (the necrosis inducing proteins), from actinobacteria (the metallo-dependent hydrolase) and from firmicutes/bacteriodetes (the mannitol phosphate dehydrogenase) rendering them pathogenic [552]. Interspecies horizontal gene transfers render saprophytic fungi pathogenetic [553]. In the genome of Aspergillus fumigatus segments containing 214 alien genes were detected. These genes were of bacterial (40%), fungal (25%) and viral (22%) origin [554]. A tobacco plant plastid inserted its DNA into the soil of Acinetobacter sp. The inserted sequence consisted of a leucyl-tRNA encoded by tobacco gene trnL, and an anchor sequence of an antibiotic-resistance (to spectinomycin and streptomycin) gene cluster [555]. Angiosperms resist horizontal gene insertions from fungi, but in rice plant (Oryza sativa) genomes five fungi-to-plant and 4 plant-to-fungi horizontal gene transfers are documented. Such gene exchanges are very rare (14 in 3,177 gene families examined), but may result in phenotypic changes of the recipients [551]. Plant pathogenic Fusarium spp. possess pathogenicity-related chromosomes and by horizontal transfer render non-pathogenic fungal strains pathogenic [556].",

The T-DNA of plant-transforming A. tumefaciens travels to the targeted plant cell nucleus via the ssDNA-binding VirE2 protein; the phosphorylated VirE2 interacting protein VIP1 accomplishes the nuclear targeting of the agrobacterial T-DNA [561]. Plasmids and their vectors (A. tumefaciens) for expression of heterologous genes in transgenic plants by horizontal transfer are commercially available [562\u2013565]. The alpha- and beta-proteobacteria, Rhizobia, form nodules on the roots of legumes, within which they enter plant cells to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Symbiotic plasmids of rhizobia horizontally transferred to the pathogenic Ralstonia solanacearum converted its pathogenicity to mutualism (symbiosis). It was the inactivation of the hrcV structural gene that allowed nodulation and the inactivation of the hrpG master virulence regulator gene product protein (HrpG) and hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (hrc = hrp conserved). This process allowed the intracellular entry of the bacteria, which then accomplished nitrogen fixation, thus modulating the transformation from pathogenicity to symbiosis [566]. Extensive horizontal exchange of genetic material occurs between plant cells in the process of grafting [567].",

Wolbachia A infects drosophila, WO-B infects insects other than drosophila, including mosquitos, and WO-D infects nematodes. The horizontal transfers range from less than 500 bp to the entire wolbachia genome (>1 Mb) and involve 4 insect and 4 nematode species as recipients [580]. The \u03b1-proteobacterium, in the order of Rickettsiales, Wolbachia pipientis, interferes with reproduction, kills male insects, or feminizes them. Wolbachia genomes express up to 1,386 coding sequences [581]. The one-way crossing incompatibility between infected males and uninfected females is the event of \u201ccytoplasmic incompatibility\u201d. The male testicles are infected, but the sperm cells do not carry live wolbachia; female egg cells are infected with wolbachia. The infected paternal chromosomes are lost, while the uninfected female chromosomes segregate properly yielding haploid male progeny. When an infected male fertilizes an infected egg cell, and the infecting wolbachia strains are identical, embryonic development proceeds unimpeded. Some Wolbachia sp. infects filarial nematodes. The wolbachia genes transferred into the insect beetle several million years ago, were found now to be disrupted, rendered transcriptionally inactive and turned into pseudogenes [582]. At least some of the wolbachia genes transferred into the mosquito Aedes sp. remained functional after an extended period of their horizontal transfer. In mosquitoes, the transferred wolbachia genes encoded receptors for malaria plasmodia in the insects\u2019 salivary glands. These wolbachia genes appear to have been originally acquired by the wolbachia genome from another insect host through lateral (horizontal) transfer [583]. The mosquito gene AAE-L004181 shows 50% aa identity with two wPip genes WP1348 and WP1346. Which one is the gene donor and to whom? Wolbachia-to-host transfer was proven [584]. The outer membrane proteins of wolbachia cells are inducers of innate immune reactions in insects, and are also apoptosis-inducers [585]. In drosophila sp., horizontally acquired transposons/retrotransposons abound, but not of wolbachia derivation. Insertins of LTR retrotransposons are the most frequent (90%), whereas non-LTR retroelements seldom (6%) succeed at their self-insertion [586, 587]. Almost the entire wolbachia genome is inserted in the bacteriome of the bedbug (Cimex lectularius). The wolbachia genome is vertically transmitted within the oocytes; bugs deprived of the wolbachia genome become infertile [588].",

The parasite of legume hosts, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) appears to have acquired a functional gene from a wolbachia; the gene product protein serves the aphid\u2019s endosymbiont, the Buchnera aphidicola [594]. The red-green colored carotenoids are encoded in pea aphids by genes of fungal derivation; after integration of these alien genes, the aphid genome duplicated them [595]. The 464 Mb genome of the pea aphid A. pisum shows extensive gene duplications, gene losses and new gene acquisitions. The expanded genes are set for chromatin modification, miRNA synthesis and sugar transport. Lost genes are those of the urea cycle and purin salvage and selenoprotein utilization, and some of the innate immune system, may be to be able to accommodate the bacterial endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola (a gamma proteobacterium), which the aphid maternally transmits to its progeny. With this endosymbiont, the aphid shares aa synthetic purine metabolic pathways. The aphid possesses the aa synthetic and degrading genes and shares the products with the endosymbiont. In turn, the endosymbiont provides the purin metabolic pathway (purine nucleoside phosphorylase, adenosine desaminase: adenosine to inosine) for the salvage of purine nucleotides, except for guanosine, which is rendered by the aphid [596\u2013598]. At least 12 genes in the aphid\u2019s genome are of bacterial origin (named in the article), but most of these genes are not of Buchnera, but are of wolbachia origin [594]. Buchnera and Hamiltonella are facultative symbionts to aphids; this type of endosymbiosis protects the aphids against pathogenic fungi, parasitoid wasps (vide infra) and heat strokes [599].",

The caterpillars\u2019 immune reaction to the injected foreign bodies (eggs) would consist of activated Toll-like receptors and phenolooxidase production. The ichnoviruses derive from ascoviruses (polyDNAviruses); descendants of iridoviruses. Ascoviruses injected into caterpillars would kill these hosts, but the ichnoviruses are attenuated and non-pathogenic. Ichnoviruses are restricted to replicate only in the female wasp\u2019s calyx cells. Ichnoviral genomes exist in the form of multiple circular DNA molecules. Ichnoviral particles assemble in the female wasps\u2019 genital tract. In the caterpillar host, the ichnoviruses do not replicate. The ichnoviral genes are not for encoding new viral particle structural proteins; the ichnoviral genome in the caterpillar encodes a number of proteins, which derive from wasp\u2019s genes inserted in the ichnoviral genome. In the female wasp\u2019s genome, most ascoviral genes were eliminated from the ichnoviral genome. The only one strain of ascovirus, which is able to replicate both in the wasp and in the caterpillar hosts is the DpAV4 (from Diadromus pulchellus). The DpAV4 is more of a symbiotic, than of a pathogenic virus. Symbiotic virus-host relationships promote reciprocal passive lateral transfers of genes between viral and host cell genomes. The viral genome undergoes recombination-primed replication in an environment, where an abundance of DNA sequences float freely. In the amoeba, the large dsDNA viruses (NCLDV, vide supra) chose this mode of genome replication. There, bacterial genomes are released from the microorganisms, which amoebae and their unicellular symbiotic algae feed on. The recombination-primed genomic replication promotes the integration of very short DNA segments (12 bp) with sequence homology to the amoebic or viral genomes. In these intracellular environments, passive lateral transfers of DNA segments to and from viral, host cell and bacterial chromosomes readily occur. In contrast, active lateral gene transfers show elements of dedication to conclude the selected process.",

The alga donated its entire sphingolipid/ceramide biosynthetic gene apparatus (seven genes) to its viral guest [158]. The biflagellated photoautotrophic protist, Cyanophora paradoxa, and Euglena gracilis (vide supra) acquired their transketolases from endosymbiotic green algae [522].

Naturally transmitted between related plants by seeds and pollens, the transmission of the entire genomic packages of these viruses, and whatever additional plant host cell genes the viral genomes might have picked up, to phylogenetically distant hosts occurs by horizontal transfers mediated by fungi [601]. Rice, maize, sorghum cells accept horizontally transferred genes by the 280,000 year old gag-pol retrotransposons called \u201cRoute66.\u201d Route66 was discovered in the genome of Japanese rice plants (Oryza sativa) in two copies residing on chromosomes 2 (nt 1 767 933 \u2013 1772 818) and chromosome 6 (nt 26 706265 \u2013 25 701 456) [602].

Gram-negative bacteria harbor distantly related PIs (E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio cholerae Helicobacter pylori). The toxin-coregulated type IV pilus (TcpA) may be encoded by cooperating phages CTX\u03d5 and VPI\u03d5. The PI contains the phage genome that encodes the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP). TCP functions as a colonization factor and as the receptor for phage CTX\u03d5 [63a,b] (vide supra). The toxin-coregulated type IV pilus (TCPA) expresses the coat protein of the VPI\u03d5 phage [63a,b, 605]. Helicobacter pylori (Hp) strains seldom succumb to phages; probably effectively eliminate them. The first isolation and photographic depiction of a lytic H. pylori phage (HP1) was certainly a sensational occasion. It is worthwhile to look up the original publications to view the electron microscopic depiction of the Hp phages [606, 607]. Genetically modified non-replicating phages lyse Hp, yet clinical phage therapy has not materialized [608].

This bacterium accompanied mankind through its evolution, at least in the last stages of it: it was present 5,000 years ago in the stomachs of the ancient Egyptians. In its extraordinary variability, genomic segments of H. pylori strains readily recombine and exchange genes through horizontal transfer [611]. Major subpopulations of Hp are those of hpEurope, hpAfrica (subdivided to hpSAfrica and hpWAfrica), and hpEAsia. The subpopulation hpAmerind parasitizes native Americans. The genomes of the Amerindian (Venezuela) Hp and hpEurope were compared and revealed characteristics of the human Hp strains following the migration of the human race out of Africa, the population of Europe by H. sapiens (no information on Homo neanderthalensis), but the material from excavated graves would be available), and the movements of human populations through Asia and through the Bering passage-way to the Americas. Even human and murine Hp strains could be compared in an evolutionary scale [612]. The core genome of Hp substrains operates with 1,111 genes, but the gene number may increase to 1,531. The cag PI gene clusters may be acquired or deleted. Each Hp strain produces by recombinations highly individualized variants in each of their hosts. In cases of multiple subspecies H. pylori infections, interspecies horizontal gene transfers occur [613]. There are conserved and mobile regions in the Hp genome. Gene replacements and horizontal gene transfers directed the evolutionary changes within Hp strains [614]. Practically all infected persons harbor their own individual Hp strain [615].",

The mortality rate for gastric cancer exceeded twofold (20/100,000) that of communities with low Hp-related parameters [627]. Helicobacter DNA is present in pancreatic cancer tissue and helicobacter bacteria (but not other gastrointestinal bacteria) appear in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue samples [628]. Pyrosequencing and PCR reveal Hp Dna in liver tissue of patients with chronic cholestatic liver diseases and in gallstones [629a,b, 630a,b]. Since the observation of cytoplasmic vacuolization in gastric mucosal cells by Hp toxin to the documentation of oncogene mutations in these cells only 13 years went by [631\u2013633]. In some patients with idiopathic thrombocyopenic purpura (ITP) and Hp antigens in their stool samples, antibodies to the Hp anticytotoxin-associated gene A product protein were found. After Hp eradication, the platelet levels returned to normal [634]. The association of Hp infection with certain types of ITP occurs world-wide [635\u2013638].",

The cell proliferation is driven by the STAT and MAPK cascades (signal transducer activation of transcription; mitogen-activated protein kinase). In mice the enterotoxin failed to induce Toll-like receptor or dendritic cell activations. Instead anti-apoptotic factors (NF\u03baB and c-IAP2) are activated. Epithelial cells of the colon produce IL-8, an NF\u03baB activator. The toxin-exposed colonic epithelial cells exude cyclooxygenase (Cox-2) and prostaglandin (PGE2). Reactive lymphoid cell infiltrates appear expressing IL-17 and the receptor for IL-23. Of the T cell factors, TCF-1 promotes, TCF-4 inhibits Wnt proto-oncogene activation [645\u2013649]. Consequential to unopposed Wnt activity is the upregulation, amplification, or even mutation of the BLC9 (B cell lymphoma) and K-ras genes and overexpression of the EGFR in epithelial cells [650\u2013654]. In contrast to H. pylori, B. fragilis is a phage-sensitive bacterium [655, 656] and responds to various antibiotic regimens [644].",

The same mechanism is operational in chemotherapy-resistant cancer cells. This author could not find comparative studies for bacterial and eukaryotic (protozoal; cancer cells of vertebrates) efflux pump genomics and proteomics, but the mechanisms of action of these entities by ATP-binding cassettes, as well as their inhibition by selected compounds (phenothiazides, chlorpromazine, verapamil) are very similar in bacteria and in tumor cells [659\u2013664]. The bacterial flora in the intestinal tract of gypsy moth larvae rapidly acquires and/or endogenously expresses efflux pump proteins for the mediation of multiple antibiotics resistance (but without any exposure to such antibiotics). Insect guts are environmentally rich in antibiotic resistance genes; there is a high potential for dissemination of such genes from host to bacterial symbionts, and in between members of the bacterial flora [665]. Disiloxanes (SILA-409, SILA-421) excelled as efflux pump inhibitors both in bacteria, where they also suppress plasmid-traffic of resistance genes (vide infra) and in multidrug resistant cancer cells [666\u2013668]. The multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family efflux transporter gene bexA was cloned from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. The BexA protein sequence is homologous to that of Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The bexA construct transferred cipro- and norfloxacin resistance to E. coli [669].",

The most prominent conjugative transposons for horizontal transfer of tetracycline and erythromycin resistance-encoding genes (tetQ, ermF) are the closely related CTnERL and CTnDOT integrases, especially the TcrEmrDOT (dot-blot hybridization, dot-plot) [675\u2013681]. The promiscuous bacteroides conjugative transposons, CTnGERM, carrier of the erythromycin-resistance gene ermG, picked up the macrolide efflux pump gene mefA from Streptococcus pyogenes [682].",

            "text": "Carcinogenic somatic mutations generated in the colonic inflammasomes are not inherited, and as such their inducers may be subject to horizontal acquisitions. The Lancet gave credit to Rudolf Virchow for proposing in 1863 that bacteria and the chronic inflammation they induce (leukoreticular infiltrates: \u201cPhlogose und Thrombose im Gef\u00e4\u00dfsystem\u201d) may induce cancers [689]. The high pathogenicity and persistence of endo- and enterotoxigenic strains of B fragilis were recognized in the 1990s [690, 691]. The molecular pathogenesis of the bacteroides enterotoxin creates an environment highly conducive to malignant transformation of the mucosal cells of the colon (vide supra) [646\u2013654]. The enterotoxin can re-arrange cellular cytoskeletons [692). It activates proto-oncogenes (c-myc; K-ras [693\u2013695] and the human relative of drosophila mutated gene \u201clegless,\u201d the BCL9 gene/gene-product protein (B cell lymphoma)). This gene-product protein stimulates the proto-oncogenic \u03b2-catenin/Wnt cascade, whose inhibitor is the dickkopf protein (DKK), which is often eliminated in the course of malignant transformation. This pathway of colon cancer oncogenesis may be shared between hereditary (APC tumor suppressor gene mutation) and inflammatory colon cancers [696]. It is not entirely clear what role DKK1-4 proteins may play in colon carcinogenesis. DKK-1 may be epigenetically inactivated and down-regulated, thus loosing its inhibitory effects on tumor cell growth [697, 698]. DKK2, 3, 4 may be upregulated; DKK-3, 4 are neo-angiogenic; DKK-4 inhibits host T cell enhancement and promotes tumor cell invasion [699\u2013701]. In contrast, DKK-4 was found not to activate, but to inhibit \u03b2-catenin signaling, colon cancer cell cycle progression and growth [702]. Vitamin D3 (1\u03b1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D) activates the gene of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin antagonist DKK-1, thus inducing differentiation in human colon cancer cells; at the same time, the vitamin D compound inactivates the gene of the tumor promoter Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway [703, 704].",

Two extremely well referenced articles review the field with the conclusions that Nod-like receptors (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domains) protect against inflammatory carcinogenesis [714] and that innate and adaptive immune reaction cooperate in the intensity of the immune reactions, but divaricate in matters of pro- and anti-tumor reactions [715]. Homozygous mutations in IL-10 receptor genes increased the propensity in patients to the development of colitis; thus, removal of a tolerogenic cytokine\u2019s actions promoted fulminant immune reactions to the intestinal bacterial commensals [716, 717]. These reports have avoided giving reference to carcinogenesis; there, not IL-10-mediated host tolerance, but intense immune reactions are needed, like in the IL-10R-mutated patients, or mice. An excellent tabulation lists innate immune responses, the IL-23/Th17-type pathway and other genes involved in inflammatory reactions of the human intestinal tract (chromosomal locations of the involved genes given). Two most impressive cartoons depict the interactions between the arms of innate and adaptive immune faculties. The article closes with therapeutic recommendations, as to the severe inflammatory reactions, but without. mentioning any favorable or adverse effects of the anti-inflammatory therapeuticals on the incidence of carcinogenesis [718]. In contrast, adaptive immune reactions mediated by CD4+ T lymphocytes are mobilized in UC against dysplastic colonic mucosa, but not against normal mucosa [719].",

The pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF\u03baB is inhibited by fluoro- and tribromsalans, sunitinib, lestaurtinib, ectinascidin, chromomycin and bortezomib [720]. The nuclear receptor PPAR (peroxisome proliferatory-activated receptor gamma) is an antagonist of NF\u03baB upon its transfer from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in order to activate inflammatory reactions-encoding genes [721]. In mice with PPAR-positive colonic epithelial cells and lymphocytes, oral intake of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) ameliorated inflammatory bowel disease and inhibited chemical carcinogenesis; CLA was ineffective in PPAR\u03b3-null mice. Successfully responding PPAR-positive mice had no macrophage infiltrations in the mesenteric lymph nodes; expressed low levels of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA, and mobilized increased numbers of regulatory T cells [722]. In inflammatory bowel disease, IL-6 and its solubilized receptor (IL-6R) form complexes; these complexes react with CD130 of mucosal T cells (IL-6 trans-signaling). In the epithelial cells, IL-6 induces STAT3 signaling (vide supra). Myeloid cells in the inflamed colonic mucosa also secrete IL-6. Both anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibodies and other IL-6 inhibitors are available for the suppression of IL-6-mediated pro- and anti-inflammatory reactions [723].",

Inflammatory cytokines are genotoxic and mutagenic; the stem cells so treated emerge as cancer stem cells. The expression of CD133 is a clue for such a transformation [724\u2013726]. Inflammatory rectal fistulous tracts could be cured by stem cell transplantation (bone marrow transplant from HLA-matched sibling to alemtuzumab- and fludarabine-preconditioned, gut-decolonized patient, whose graft-versus host disease was treated with prednisone). Full chimerism was established without GvHD [716]. From Russia comes a favorable report on improved clinical course of patients with UC treated with allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells [727]. In Hungary, regeneration of the inflammatory damage in the colonic mucosa by stem cells migrating to the lesions was observed. As yet unidentified lymphocytic aggregates and the migrating stem cells appeared to have cooperated in the process [728]. If the thesis stands, that certain inflammatory cytokines may be genotoxic to stem cells embedded in the colonic mucosa [725], it is then essential to recognize those cytokines and cellular elements (Paneth cells) that sustain the integrity and the healthy homeostasis in the bowel mucosa [724, 729] (Table 2.1).",

Some colon adenocarcinomas may be generated by the inflammatory cascades induced by the B. fragilis enterotoxin. In gastric carcinoma- and lymphomagenesis, the H. pylori CagA gene product protein initiates the well defined cascade terminating in lymphoma- and/or adenocarcinoma induction [737a,b]. Cag A (cytotoxin-associated protein/antigen) may induce cell senescence or carcinogenesis in the gastric mucosa.

            "text": "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) of cancer cells is a complex act in the interest of increased virulence of the malignant pheno-genotype. The Ras oncoprotein activates TGF-\u03b2 (transforming growth factor) production, which activates the snail genomic sequences followed by lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) activation. The Bcl-3 protein translocates into the nucleus to react with N-cadherin DNA; in the cytoplasm, cyclin D is inactivated. When the WNT-induced signaling protein (WISP) is inhibited, E-cadherin expression is reduced in tumor cells, which gain invasiveness. The Snail and Twist proteins collaborate with ras and inactivate p53 and Rb (retinoblastoma) proteins, an anti-apoptotic event: tumor cells are now protected from apoptotic death. The SPARC protein (secreted protein acidic rich in cystein) promotes the nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin, which further increases the activation of LEF. This is the environment in which a subclass of tumor-promoter T-Lymphocytes is generated. This lymphocyte population induces (either in a causative, or in a coincidental manner) ras gene point-mutations in human breast cancer cells. These breast cancer cells metastasize to the regional (axillary) lymph nodes [755]. Sinkovics proposed the term of traitor/transforming T cells (T/T T cells) for this class of host T lymphocytes [756]. The generation of T/T T lymphoid cell clones have nor as yet shown in B. fragilis enterotoxin-exposed colon cells, but it is documented in the microenvironment of human breast cancer that a subpopulation of reactive T lymphocytes (T/T T cells) with upregulated ILEI genes (interleukin-like epidermal-to-mesenchymal transition inducer) produce TGF-\u03b2 [755]. Colon cancer cells (vide supra) undergo EMT and express the molecular signatures of up-regulated vimentin, E-cadherin, Slug and Claudin protein families, forkhead transcription factors, and WNT signaling with down-regulated dickkopf (vide supra) [757]. This author proposed that ras-mutated colon cancer cells were induced by T/T T-like lymphocytes, which promote their metastases in the regional lymph nodes [642]. Tumor cells (pancreatic carcinoma cells) expressing FoxP3, thus imitating Treg cells, neutralize, and protect themselves from the attack of, immune T cells [758]. While tumor cells undergo EMT, the tumor stroma (the extracellular matrix) either plays the role of the initiator, or changes in response. Non-coding RNAs (miR-200; miR-205) interact with vimentin in the stroma and with E-cadherin within the tumor cells. TWIST protein induces miR-10b, which drives breast cancer cells\u2019 invasiveness, whereas miR-335 antagonizes the process [759]. The mammalian cell microRNA, miR-146a, emerges as an inhibitor of innate immune reactions and a multiple tumor growth promoter; it is activated by NF\u03baB [760] The tumor-promoting events of EMT are open to study, if the cascade of gene activations occurs within the tumor cell, or if a fusion of the epithelial tumor cell with a mesenchymal cell (as well documented in the case of melanoma and macrophages) resulted in the transfer of activated mesenchymal phenotype-inducer genes into the tumor cell from a mesenchymal cell of the stroma.",

The NH phenomenon was discovered by this author in the mid-1960s, understood clearly and reported in explicit terms that a mouse leukemia virus-carrier lymphoma cell fused with a plasma cell secreting antibody specific to the lymphoma cell as the lymphoma cell expressed retroviral envelope antigens. This cell line (Fig. 2.4a,b) was maintained in suspension cultures and as more ascites tumors for over 10 years, while it continued making the specific antibody [213, 762\u2013772]. This author promptly proposed that the Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin\u2019s disease may be B-cell natural hybridomas, and the S\u00e9zary cells of mycosis fungoides are T cell natural hybridomas [765, 769]. Molecular biology of RS cells so far provided no support for this theory, but there remains room for further reasoning in favor of natural hybridoma formation mediated by a fusogenic retrovirus (with or without EBV) in these pathological entities [213, 768\u2013770].\n",

In treated cancers, new stem cell type emerges; these are the \u201crecurrent cancer stem cells\u201d (rCSCs). The rCSCs display strong resistance toward external chemo-radiotherapy by gaining strong anti-apoptotic faculties, and toward internal host immunity, thus practicing \u201concogenic resistance.\u201d The phenotypic heterogeneity of these newly emerged rCSCs gives them the propensity to fuse with mesenchymal cells (monocytes) for their further advantage to invasiveness and metastasis formation [774].",

In 1908, the rapid reproducibility of lymphocytes upon stimulation caught Rous\u2019 attention [775]. In 1910 Rous wrote: \u201cThe fate of implanted tumor depends directly on whether it elicits from the host a vascularizing stroma. So, too, it is with implanted embryo\u201d [776]. In 1910\u20131911, Rous transferred with cells and with filtrates a sarcomatous tumor in chickens (hens): the transmissible avian neoplasm, a sarcoma of the common fowl [777]. In 1912, Rous and Murphy observed lymphocytic activity in response to the transplanted sarcomatous tumors in the inoculated hens [778]. The Rous sarcoma virus and its sub-strains were the teachers of tumor retrovirologists world-wide for decades to come. It was the three editions of Ludwik Gross\u2019 textbook that provided the basic foundations of tumor virology for the early decades of that discipline [779]. Hidesaburo Hanafusa of the Rockefeller University, New York City, found the oncogenic genome of the Rous sarcoma virus (v-src) and the phosphorylated tyrosine kinases that it encodes in order to build the structural proteins of the virus particle; especially the env/Env gene and protein that was immunogenic. He realized that a cellular homologue of the viral oncogene existed (c-src) in the hosts of these tumors [780]. However, ahead of him at the University of California, San Francisco, the team of J. M. Bishop and H. E. Varmus, D. Stehelin and P. K. Vogt, established the DNA identity of the Rous sarcoma (and other avian sarcoma) proviruses in the cells of healthy hosts with that of the mature virions [781, 782]. The enzyme, the reverse transcriptase, which transcribes an RNA viral genome into a DNA provirus, was discovered by D. Baltimore and H. M. Temin and S. Mizutani [783]. Here is the most ostentatious (\u00e9clat!) example of gene switching: a host cell gene becomes incorporated into the DNA proviral genome of a retrovirus. It may remain independent within, or it may be fused with, a genomic sequence of the retrovirus, but when the retroviral genome is transcribed and translated, the usurped host gene and its gene product protein remain incorporated in the retroviral particle and expressed in the cell, respectively, that the virus transformed. If the usurped host gene encodes a growth factor, the retrovirus replicating in a malignantly transformed cell will overproduce that growth factor. Viral oncogenes and oncoproteins have been generated by gene transfer from a cellular genome into a viral genome.",

Haploidentical donor bone marrow transplants often induced graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and failed to completely restore the function of B lineage lymphocytes. In clinical trials, children (infants) with adenosine deaminase deficiency (X-SCID) receive infused autologous bone marrow progenitor stem cells, which were transduced by a retroviral vector in vitro replacing the deficient gene. Restoration of the immune system occurs without GvHD [795]. In X-SCID the gamma c chain of the IL-2R is mutated (\u03b3-c null) and is not signaling after stimulation with EBV. The cells with mutated IL-2R could be restored to function with a retroviral vector (G1\u03b3cSvNa) transducing the wild-type \u03b3-c gene (c for common, because the IL-4R and IL-7R are also involved). In the transduced cells, the IL-2Rs signaled normally and phosphorylated the Jak1/Jak3 (janus kinase) tyrosine kinases [796]. However gene re-insertions by a murine leukemia retroviral vector carried a not foreseen major risk. Five of 20 patients developed acute T cell leukemia (first reported as \u201cclonal T cell proliferation\u201d) after retrovirally vectored gene insertion. The vector retrovirus inserted its genome carrying the correct gene next to the T cell proto-oncogene LMO2, and thus activated it by the mechanisms of \u201cinsertional oncogenesis\u201d [797\u2013799]. The proto-oncogene LMO2 stands for \u201cLIM only protein 2\u201d and LIMs are mesenchymal (muscle, etc) proteins encoded by a family of genes (lin/isl/mec). The LMO2 gene is involved in T cell generation and in its activated state transforms from a proto-oncogene into an oncogene [800]. A single chain Fv antibody fragment was developed to specifically inhibit LMO2 [801], but its clinical usefulness is not yet known.",

            "text": "The Max Delbr\u00fcck Institute of Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany, has taken the directives toward nonviral delivery approaches in human gene therapy. A plasmid expressing a transposase in trans position and a donor plasmid containing the DNA (gene) to be integrated are to be used in combination. The DNA to be integrated is flanked in cis position by the terminal repeat sequences of the transposase. The candidate transposons are the Tc1/mariner-type Sleeping Beauty (SB), the Tol2 (both originally fish transposons) and the piggybac (PB). In order to increase the activity of SB, the transposase had to be reconstructed by exchanging its aa composition. Thus arriving at the hyperactive SB100X transposon/transposase, its increased activity in its integration process is over one hundred-fold elevated. The nonmariner-type Tol2 transposon can carry genes as large as 11 kb. While excess transposase could inhibit SB by \u201coverproduction inhibition,\u201d Tol2 works better with more transposase at its disposal. The PB transposon is of insect origin (deriving from the lepidopteran noctuid, the cabbage moth, Trichoplusia ni). It was discovered because it inserted itself into the genome of the nuclear polyhedrosis virus, the baculovirus Autographa californica [802\u2013804]. PB can transpose inserts of 14 kb (too large for any retroviral vector). While SB has no human relatives, PB has its related sequences dispersed in human chromosomes. It is a concern how these endogenous human PB elements would react to the insertion of an exogenous PB transposons. The LTR sequences of SB100X are inert when it comes to activating host cell genes at the transposons integration site. This inactivity has been reinforced by adding an insulator sequence to the expression cassette of the transposons. In contrast, N-terminal DNA-binding domain fused with the transposon PB rendered the transposase more permissive as to its acceptance of DNA (gene sequences) for integration. Silent pluripotent stem cells also accept genes integrated by transposons for the re-programming of these cells. In induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, the c-myc\u00d7 c-Myc activation carries the potential danger of oncogenesis. Some called c-myc \u201cthe oncogene from hell.\u201d Therefore activation of c-myc should be avoided (especially in the case of retroviral vectoring). The PB transposon could already safely deliver genes into mouse fibroblasts and thus reprogram them into iPS cells of endodermal, mesodermal and ectodermal lineages. The natural transposons/transposases become \u201cdesigner transposases\u201d opening up avenues toward regenerative medicine and cancer therapy by horizontally inserted genes [805].",
