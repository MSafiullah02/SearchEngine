Accordingly in multicenter clinical trials conducted in China, HCQ exhibits efficacy and acceptable safety in attenuating COVID-19-associated pneumonia (Gao et al. 2020). In another small open-label non-randomized clinical trial from France, it has been shown that HCQ is associated with the reduction of viral load (Gautret et al. 2020). Accordingly, Food and Drug Administration has authorized clinicians in USA to prescribe HCQ for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (Lenzer 2020). However, from a recent analysis of 368 patients in U.S. Veterans hospitals, it has been found that HCQ does not provide any benefit, but more side effects and deaths, indicating a possible HCQ puzzle in COVID-19.",

However, sometimes, when inflammation is initiated, it goes beyond control leading to prolonged inflammation to secrete a wide range of proinflammatory molecules that ultimately cause tissue damage and death. It is becoming clear that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms suffer from cytokine storm and broad-spectrum inflammatory events (Mehta et al. 2020). It has been shown that COVID-19 patients in the ICU have higher plasma levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-7, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GSCF), interferon-\u03b3 inducible protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03b1 (MIP1-\u03b1), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) as compared to non-ICU patients (Huang et al. 2020). According to Chen et al. (Chen et al. 2020), severe COVID-19 cases more frequently have dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1. Therefore, controlling proinflammatory cytokines may be beneficial for COVID-19 patients in the ICU. Interestingly, HCQ treatment has been shown to control the overproduction of IL-1\u03b2 and GM-CSF in acute rheumatic fever (Kim et al. 2018) and to reduce the level of IL-6 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (Batun-Garrido et al. 2018).",

Interestingly, CQ inhibits the activation of p38MAPK to inhibit the induction of proinflammatory cytokines in THP-1 cells (Seitz et al. 2003). Moreover, NADPH oxidase (NOX2), a multimeric complex of gp91phox, p67phox, p47phox, p22phox, and small G protein Rac, catalyzes the production of superoxide to play an important role in oxidative stress and inflammation (Bylund et al. 2010). The gp91phox is the catalytic subunit of NOX2 and interestingly, HCQ attenuates the translocation of gp91phox to the membrane (Muller-Calleja et al. 2017), leading to the inhibition of oxidative stress and proinflammatory signaling pathways. Therefore, CQ/HCQ treatment may be beneficial for COVID-19 patients via its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (Fig. 1).",

On the other hand, HCQ, being a weak base, accumulates within acidic vesicles, such as endosome and lysosome, increases the pH and halts the pH-dependent endosome-mediated viral entry. Khan et al. (Khan et al. 2010) have demonstrated that prior treatment with CQ significantly protects Vero cells against Chikungunya virus through the prevention of endocytosis and/or endosomal acidification. Accordingly, in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, CQ exhibits efficacy in lowering the viral load and treating dengue in Vietnamese adults (Tricou et al. 2010). In case of SARS-CoV-1, Wang et al. have shown that the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes leading to the release of the viral genome into the cytosol occurs at acidic pH (Wang et al. 2008). In recent cell culture studies, both CQ and HCQ also efficiently reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection (Liu et al. 2020a). Therefore, HCQ is expected to increase endosomal pH and lower viral load in patients with COVID-19 (Fig. 2).",

This is a cell surface receptor, and lung, heart and kidney are very rich in ACE2 (Zaman et al. 2002). However, recently, ACE2 came to the forefront due to another reason and that is the requirement of this receptor by COVID-19 for entering into host cells. COVID-19 binds to ACE2 via the S protein on its surface, which is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits during infection. Since S1 contains the receptor-binding domain, this subunit permits COVID-19 to directly attach to the peptidase domain of ACE2 (Ledford 2020; Stower 2020). Now, being a membrane receptor, ACE2 needs to be glycosylated to go to the membrane and be active. However, HCQ treatment inhibits glycosylation of ACE2 receptors and thereby prevents COVID-19 from binding to the receptor and its entry into host cells (Fig. 2). Although debatable, this mechanism also suggests that HCQ may have a prophylactic effect since it would reduce the chances of COVID-19 infection.",

This beneficial heptapeptide (Ang1-7) functions through its receptor Mas to exhibit vasodilatory/anti-proliferative activities (Wang et al. 2012). Moreover, Ang1-7 is also capable of inhibiting myocardial NADPH oxidase leading to a decrease in myocardial oxidative stress and inflammation (Bodiga et al. 2011). Therefore, ACE2 is considered as a negative regulator of AngII-induced myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction. It has been demonstrated that the deletion of the ACE2 gene in mouse results in abnormal heart function (Oudit et al. 2007). ACE2-deficient mice also exhibit increased level of AngII in plasma and heart leading to cardiac dysfunction (Yamamoto et al. 2006; Oudit et al. 2007). Accordingly, recombinant human ACE2 also displays beneficial effects in a clinically relevant model of pressure-overload induced heart failure (Basu et al. 2017). Therefore, in general, inhibition of ACE2 leads to an increase in vaconstrictor and a decrease in vasodilator, ultimately increasing the chances of inducing and/or aggravating cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks, stroke, or arrhythmia. As a result, by suppressing ACE2, HCQ may pose risks for patients with preexisting cardiovascular issues.",

Accordingly, as expected, decreased IFN-\u03b3 expression in CD4 + T cells are associated with severe COVID-19 cases (Pedersen and Ho 2020). In addition to T cells, number of B cells and natural killer (NK) cells also decrease in COVID-19 patients with severe cases than mild ones (Wang et al. 2020). Therefore, maintaining the homeostasis and classical functions of T cells is important for the recovery of severe COVID-19 patients. However, according to Landewe et al. (Landewe et al. 1995), CQ inhibits the proliferation of T cells at least partly through interfering with the production of IL-2 protein and the induction of IL-2 mRNA. Accordingly, by attenuating T cell proliferation, CQ/HCQ may exhibit adverse effect on severe COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3b).",

It is crucial for the endosomal pH to be low so that old damaged cells can be removed during autophagy. However, a number of studies have shown that CQ and HCQ can interfere lysosomal function and autophagy at multiple steps (Sundelin and Terman 2002; Frustaci et al. 2012; Mauthe et al. 2018). Lysosomal pH plays a critical for lysosomal enzymes to be active in hydrolysis. It has been demonstrated that CQ and HCQ increase the pH of endosomal compartments to weaken the maturation of lysosomes and autophagosomes (Fox and Kang 1993; Mauthe et al. 2018). Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) is an enzyme involved in the catabolism of lipid-modified proteins and Rebecca et al.

Important aspects of COVID-19 treatment are to inhibit viral entry into host cells and reduce viral load. From these criteria, HCQ fits very well as a possible anti-COVID-19 drug (Fig. 4). Moreover, oxidative stress and inflammation are important pathological aspects of many human disorders, which are also seen in COVID-19 cases. HCQ is also right there to take care of these two comorbid issues. However, by inhibiting the function of ACE2, this so-called miracle drug may augment vasoconstriction and worsen cardiovascular problems in persons with preexisting hypertension, obesity and heart disease. This is an important issue as hypertension and obesity are very common in USA. Loss of T cells has become an important feature of severe COVID-19 patients suffering from acute respiratory problems. Since HCQ inhibits the proliferation of T cells, it may not bring good news for COVID-19 patients who are in the ICU. Moreover, the aged population is more susceptible to COVID-19 severity than the younger ones. Since proteinopathy and neurodegeneration are also common in older population, HCQ may increase the risk of proteinopathic neurodegenerative diseases in susceptible persons via suppressing autophagy.",

Second, HCQ may not be safe for COVID-19 patients who have or are at risk for cardiovascular diseases or may lead to unfavorable outcome in older patients with other preexisting conditions. However, the patients who would suffer from severe COVID-19 and would need a treatment are those with comorbidities. Therefore, caution must be taken before prescribing HCQ for severe COVID-19 patients. It would be very nice to see if through the ongoing clinical trials, HCQ having a rich history of treating many human diseases including malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis also becomes effective in treating COVID-19 patients (Fig. 4).",

Together with activated p300 (a proinflammatory histone acetyl transferase), the NF-\u03baB then binds to the promoter of different genes ultimately leading to the transcription and production of different proinflammatory molecules (e.g. tumor necrosis factor alpha or TNF\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2 or IL-1\u03b2, etc.). HCQ inhibits the phosphorylation of p38 to attenuate the production of different proinflammatory cytokines. Again, activation of NADPH oxidase (a pentameric complex of gp91phox, p67phox, p47phox, p22phox, and Rac) produces superoxide radicals to cause oxidative stress and the activation of NF-\u03baB for inflammation.
