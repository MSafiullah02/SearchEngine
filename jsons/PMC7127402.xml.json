            "text": "The discovery process of a potential new drug is time-consuming [1]. The development and approval of active pharmaceutical ingredient can take 10\u201315 years. Pharmaceutical companies spend nearly 1.2 billion U.S. dollars for bringing the new drug to the market. Researchers identify particular cellular and genetic factors that play a major role in each disease condition [2]. They target these biological markers with newly developed biological and chemical agents. Sometimes the developed molecules show drug-like effects. During the discovery process, nearly 5000 new compounds are identified and undergo various preclinical evaluations [3]. Out of these compounds, on an average approximately 5 are selected for further clinical development. After several years of clinical evaluations only one of these compounds would finally receive approval for human use [4]. Fig. 1\nshows the steps involved in the drug development and drug repositioning. The discovery and developmental stages of new drug molecules include target identification (targeting cellular and genetic markers associated with a particular disease), target prioritization/validation (identification of developed molecule that have an effect on selected target), lead identification (molecules capable of treating the disease), and lead optimization (comparison of properties of various lead compounds and selection of lead compound with the greatest potential) [5,6]. Preclinical studies which follow drug discovery ensure the safety of the drug by laboratory and animal testing. After the preclinical research, investigational new drug (IND) application is submitted to FDA for permission to conduct clinical testing [7]. Clinical research phase includes phase I, II and III studies and is mainly to ensure safety and efficacy of drug in humans [8,9]. US Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) review team examines all the submitted documents related to the drug and makes a final decision. After approval of drug by FDA, manufacturing companies conduct post-market safety monitoring (Phase IV) and post approval studies.",

            "text": "Despite the huge investments and time-consuming processes, the chances of the new drug molecule clearing all the drug approval processes are often negligible [10]. So, the drug manufacturing companies focus on other viable options for drug research. National centre for advancing translational sciences (NCATS), an initiative from of national institute of health (NIH) in the united states of america (USA), defined drug repurposing as \u201cstudying the drugs that are already approved to treat one disease or condition to see if they are safe and effective for treating other diseases\u201d [11]. In May 2012, NCATS introduced the program \u201cDiscovery of New Therapeutic Uses for Existing Molecules\u201d to focus on new therapeutic indications for the existing drugs, drugs currently in clinical development as well as shelved and discontinued drugs [12]. This approach is also known as repositioning or drug reprofiling. Drug repurposing is a promising approach and is mainly applied for the treatment of rare genetic diseases, and it offers significant benefits to the pharmaceutical industries [13,14]. The usual drug development process may delay the translation of discovery from bench to bedside. This alternate approach overcomes most of the cost and time-consuming hurdles during the drug development process [15]. Drug repurposing was initiated with expanding interest from pharmaceutical organizations and the recognizable proof of different cheminformatics and bioinformatics findings [16]. Out of these, nearly 10% of repurposed drugs were approved by regulatory bodies and 70% are in various stages of clinical development [17].",

The success created a big interest in repurposing which resulted in the formation of many repurposing focused startup companies [18]. Many reviews as well as reports of market research confirms repurposing has an important share in the life cycle management of products with an R&D spending of 10\u201350% [19]. In order to understand the history on the scope of practice of drug repurposing Nancy et al. reported a bibliometric analysis by examining in depth a few drugs. Few examples include chlorpromazine synthesized in 1950 that was indicated for use in controlling mental disorders and as a preoperative medication which was later tried for various diseases like treating whooping cough and symptoms developed in radiation therapy for cancer patients in 1972 [[20], [21], [22]]. Chloroquine was a well-known antimalarial compound synthesized in the year 1934 and was later targeted towards many other diseases including parasitic diseases (before 1960), fever, lupus skin rashes [23,24].

The finding was supported by public microarray results from the GEO database, which was analyzed using Connectivity-Map, a database connecting diseases, genes and drugs.

This is an interesting result since use of TMZ alone is not effective for gliomas after a while due to the development of drug resistance by malignant cells. The authors observed that TMZ treatment followed by a pre-treatment with RSV significantly enhanced chemo-sensitivity and suppressed the growth of glioma cells by reducing Cdk-5 activity along with simultaneous induction of autophagy and Caspase-3 mediated apoptosis. This study also revealed the reduced expression of Ki67, GFAP and markers of angiogenesis (CD31, VEGF) in case of TMZ + RSV therapy in glioma treatment. CD31, a platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a cytokine with multiple functions play a key role in endothelial migration as well as proliferation and is highly expressed in glioma [[201], [202], [203], [204], [205], [206]].

Imatinib is a perfect example for this scenario, which is used in the therapy of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), one of the most common mesenchymal tumors of the GI tract. Imatinib loses its desired activity due to development of resistance by tumor cells. Second line therapies involving sunitinib and regorafenib are also not effective due to multiple reasons including cytotoxicity and limited clinical response. Lu (2019) attempted to solve this problem by repurposing cabozantinib for GIST treatment. Authors reported that cabozantinib exhibited higher potency than imatinib against primary gain-of-function mutations of cKIT, a tyrosine kinase receptor which plays the major role in the pathophysiology of GIST by the downstream signaling of MEK/ERK/RAS/RAF, STAT 5 and PI3K/AKT pathways [[207], [208], [209], [210]]. In this study, cabozantinib showed good in vitro and in vivo efficacy in the cKIT mutant-driven preclinical models of GISTs and also displayed a prolonged and sustained effect in the watchful waiting period after the treatment withdrawal. This study increases the scope of carbozantinib as a potent candidate for GIST treatment in future.",

It is approved by the FDA for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and imatinib resistant GIST. Recently, Chatziathanasiadou (2019) studied the activity of sunitinib against glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), one of the most dangerous form of malignancy. Treatment of GBM has many limitations due to the unknown pathophysiology of the disease and also due to the variety of physiological factors like poor blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability. The authors successfully developed a validated LC-MS/MS method for the in vitro and in vivo quantitation of sunitinib in glioblastoma cells. There is no report of other study for the estimation of sunitinib uptake in GBM, therefore this finding is quite significant. This method was validated and accredited according to ISO 17025:2005 guidelinein human plasma and successfully applied to cancer patient plasma. The method was successfully adopted to establish a protocol for the evaluation of sunitinib accumulation into M095K glioma cell lines. This work definitely gives some additional momentum in repurposing studies of cancer drugs [211].",

The authors repored that tivantinib is a novel glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2) inhibitor that potently kills AML cells. Tivantinib as single agent or combination therapy with ABT-199 may represent attractive new therapeutic opportunities for AML [212]. GSK3\u03b1 has been already reported as a new target in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by its inactivation via activation of several pathways such as PKB/AKT, S6K, RAS-MAPK and Wnt and hedgehog pathways [[212], [213], [214]]. However, most GSK3 inhibitors lack specificity for GSK3\u03b1 over GSK3\u03b2 and other kinases. This work revealed that tivantinib alone or in combination with ABT-199 can effectively inhibit the colony forming capacity of AML bone marrow mononuclear cells. This study gives the possibilities of developing treatment for AML based on tivantinib and further in vivo studies can shed more light on the anticancer potential of the same [212].",

The authors applied drug repurposing approach separately on nine cutaneous diseases including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and alopecia areata and eight other immune mediated diseases and obtained a mean area under the receiver operating characteristics of 0.93 in cross validation. They gave emphasis on psoriasis, which is a chronic inflammatory condition of skin that affects more than 100 million people worldwide and using this approach the authors were able to confirm drugs that are known to be effective for psoriasis and to identify potential candidates used to treat other diseases. This work provided an effective algorithm that can be used to identify repurposed drugs for immune disrupted dermatological diseases [229].",

The authors demonstated the anti-fibrotic potential of niclosamide in TGF-\u03b21 induced in vitro model of pulmonary fibrosis and 21-day in vivo model of bleomycin induced PF respectively. This study showed that niclosamide holds the potential for anti-fibrotic effect by various mechanisms as illustrated in Fig. 4\nwhich includes blockade of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)as well inhibiting the deposition of extracellular matrix, downregulation of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) expression. This leads to reduction in angiogenesis and blockade of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling thereby inhibiting \u03b2-catenin translocation into the nucleus, TGF-\u03b21 production, fibroblasts proliferation and collagen fibers secretion which gives scope for developing successful drug candidate for PF treatment [[230], [231], [232], [233]].",

But this process is a big scenario which utilizes lot of cost including money and facility and takes very long time of around fifteen years. Repurposing is a vital concept which can overcome these tedious tasks and can boost the drug development process to a significant level. The current repurposing methods include statistical screening of the approved drug and to find the good binding target using in silico methods. Since this requires the use of wide library of compounds and data more feasible techniques for repurposing have to be developed. The influence of target is another possibility which is not much explored. The original and repurposed target may have a significant similarity owing to the good binding drug. This aspect has to be exploited at molecular level which can further make the drug repurposing process more efficient and feasible.",
