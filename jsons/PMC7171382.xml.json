This sewer, and others like it, simply collected wastes and discharged them into the nearest lake, river, or ocean. This made cities more habitable, but its success depended on transferring the pollution problem from one place to another. Although this worked reasonably well for the Romans, it does not work well today. Current population densities are too high to permit a simple dependence on transference. Thus, modern-day sewage is treated before it is discharged into the environment. In the latter part of the nineteenth century, the design of sewage systems allowed collection with treatment to lessen the impact on natural waters. Today, more than 15,000 wastewater treatment plants treat approximately 150 billion liters of wastewater per day in the United States alone. In addition, septic tanks, which were also introduced at the end of the nineteenth century, serve approximately 25% of the U.S. population, largely in rural areas.",

It may be associated with the survival of different agents in the environment during the different seasons. Giardia, for example, can survive winter temperatures very well. Alternatively, excretion differences among animal reservoirs may be involved, as is the case with Cryptosporidium.

Over time, the increase in biofilm thickness leads to limited oxygen diffusion to the deeper layers of the biofilm, creating an anaerobic environment near the filter medium surface. As a result, the organisms eventually slough from the surface and a new biofilm is formed. BOD removal by trickling filters is approximately 85% for low-rate filters (U.S. EPA, 1977). Effluent from the trickling filter usually passes into a final clarifier to further separate solids from effluent (Fig. 24.6).",

Effluent from primary treatment is pumped into a tank and mixed with a bacteria-rich slurry known as activated sludge. Air or pure oxygen pumped through the mixture encourages bacterial growth and decomposition of the organic material. The material then goes to a secondary settling tank, where water is siphoned off the top of the tank and sludge is removed from the bottom. Some of the sludge is used as an inoculum for primary effluent. The remainder of the sludge, known as secondary sludge, is removed. This secondary sludge is added to primary sludge from primary treatment, and subsequently indigenous anaerobic digestion occurs (Fig. 24.6). The end product of this process is known as biosolids (see Section 24.8). The concentration of pathogens is reduced in the activated sludge process by antagonistic microorganisms as well as by adsorption to or incorporation in the secondary sludge.",

A mean cell residence time of three to four days is necessary for effective settling (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003). Poor settling may also be caused by sudden changes in temperature, pH, absence of nutrients, and presence of toxic metals and organics. A common problem in the activated sludge process is filamentous bulking, which consists of slow settling and poor compaction of solids in the clarifier. Filamentous bulking is usually caused by the excessive growth of filamentous microorganisms. The filaments produced by these bacteria interfere with sludge settling and compaction. A high SVI (>150 ml/g) indicates bulking conditions. Filamentous bacteria are able to predominate under conditions of low dissolved oxygen, low F/M, low nutrients, and high sulfide levels.

Both sedimentation and aeration play a role in pathogen reduction. Primary sedimentation is more effective for the removal of the larger pathogens such as helminth eggs, but solid-associated bacteria and even viruses are also removed. During aeration, pathogens are inactivated by antagonistic microorganisms and by environmental factors such as temperature. The greatest removal probably occurs by adsorption or entrapment of the organisms within the biological floc that forms. The ability of activated sludge to remove viruses is related to the ability to remove solids. This is because viruses tend to be solid associated, and are subject to removal along with the floc. Activated sludge typically removes 90% of the enteric bacteria and 90\u201399% of the enteroviruses and rotaviruses (Rao et al., 1986). Ninety percent of Giardia and Cryptosporidium can also be removed (Rose and Carnahan, 1992), being largely concentrated in the sludge. Because of their large size, helminth eggs are effectively removed by sedimentation and are rarely found in sewage effluent in the United States, although they may be detected in the sludge. However, although the removal of the enteric pathogens may seem large, it is important to remember that initial concentrations are also large (i.e., the concentration of all enteric viruses in 1 liter of raw sewage may be as high as 100,000 in some parts of the world).",

The use of iron and aluminum salts for coagulation can also result in 90% or greater reductions in enteric viruses.

The detention time of wastewater is generally 3 to 5 days.\u2022\nAnaerobic ponds (Fig. 24.14B) may be 1 to 10 m deep, and require a relatively long detention time of 20\u201350 days. These ponds, which do not require expensive mechanical aeration, generate small amounts of sludge. Often, anaerobic ponds serve as a pretreatment step for high-BOD organic wastes rich in protein and fat (e.g., meat wastes) with a heavy concentration of suspended solids.\u2022\nFacultative ponds (Fig. 24.15\n) are most common for domestic waste treatment. Waste treatment is provided by both aerobic and anaerobic processes. These ponds range in depth from 1 to 2.5 m and are subdivided in three layers: an upper aerated zone, a middle facultative zone, and a lower anaerobic zone. The detention time varies between five and 30 days.\u2022\nAerated lagoons or ponds (Fig. 24.16\n), which are mechanically aerated, may be 1\u20132 m deep and have a detention time of less than 10 days. In general, treatment depends on the aeration time and temperature, as well as the type of wastewater. For example, at 20\u00b0C an aeration period of five days results in 85% BOD removal.\n",

In rural areas of developing countries these are still used. These pit toilets, however, often allowed untreated wastes to seep into the groundwater, allowing pathogens to contaminate drinking water supplies. This risk to public health led to the development of septic tanks and properly constructed drain fields. Primarily, septic tanks serve as repositories where solids are separated from incoming wastewater and biological digestion of the waste organic matter can take place under anaerobic conditions. In 1997, 25% of the homes in the United States depended on septic tanks. Approximately 33% of all new homes constructed use septic tanks. Most septic tanks are located in the eastern United States (Fig. 24.17\n). In a typical septic tank system (Fig. 24.18\n), the wastewater and sewage enter a tank made of concrete, metal, or fiberglass. There, grease and oils rise to the top as scum, and solids settle to the bottom. The wastewater and sewage then undergo anaerobic bacterial decomposition, resulting in the production of a sludge. The wastewater usually remains in the septic tank for just 24\u201372 h, after which it is channeled out to a drain field. This drain field or leach field is composed of small perforated pipes that are embedded in gravel below the surface of the soil. Periodically, the residual sludge in the septic tank, known as septage, is pumped out into a tank truck and taken to a treatment plant for disposal.",

As suburban population densities increase, however, groundwater and surface water pollution may arise, indicating a need to shift to a commercial municipal sewage system. (In fact, private septic systems are sometimes banned in many suburban areas.) Moreover, septic tanks are not appropriate for every area of the country. They do not work well, for example, in cold, rainy climates, where the drain field may be too wet for proper evaporation, or in areas where the water table is shallow. High densities of septic tanks can also be responsible for nitrate contamination of groundwater. Finally, most of the waterborne disease outbreaks associated with groundwater in the United States are thought to result from contamination by septic tanks.",

Because of limited water resources in the western United States, reuse is considered essential. Usually, stricter treatment and microbial standards must be met before land application. The highest degree of treatment is required when wastewater will be used for food crop irrigation, with lesser treatment for landscape irrigation or fiber crops. For example, the state of California requires no disinfection of wastewater for irrigation and no limits on coliform bacteria. However, if the reclaimed wastewater is used for surface irrigation of food crops and open landscaped areas, chemical coagulation (to precipitate suspended matter), followed by filtration and disinfection to reduce the coliform concentration to 2.2/100 ml is required. In some cities excess effluent is disposed of in riverbeds that are normally dry. Such disposal can create riparian areas (Fig. 24.20\n).",

Two types of constructed wetland systems are in general use: (1) free water surface (FWS) systems; and (2) subsurface flow systems (SFS).

            "text": "There has been increasing interest in the use of natural systems for the treatment of municipal wastewater as a form of tertiary treatment (Kadlec and Knight, 1996). Artificial or constructed wetlands have a higher degree of biological activity than most ecosystems; thus transformation of pollutants into harmless by-products or essential nutrients for plant growth can take place at a rate that is useful for the treatment of municipal wastewater (Case Study 24.1\n). Most artificial wetlands in the United States use reeds or bulrushes, although floating aquatic plants such as water hyacinths and duckweed have also been used. To reduce potential problems with flying insects, subsurface flow wetlands have also been built (Fig. 24.24\n). In these types of wetlands all of the flow of the wastewater is below the surface of a gravel bed containing plants tolerant of water-saturated soils. Most of the existing information on the performance of these wetlands concerns coliform and fecal coliform bacteria. Kadlec and Knight (1996) have summarized the existing literature on this topic. They point out that natural sources of indicators in treatment wetlands never reach zero because wetlands are open to wildlife. Reductions in fecal coliforms are generally greater than 99%, but there is a great deal of variation, probably depending on the season, type of wetland, numbers and type of wildlife, and retention time in the wetland. Volume-based and area-based bacterial die-off models have been used to estimate bacterial die-off in surface flow wetlands (Kadlec and Knight, 1996).Case Study 24.1Sweetwater Wetlands Infiltration\u2013Extraction Facility in Tucson, ArizonaTucson, Arizona, is located in the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States. Because of limited water supplies reclamation of wastewater is critical. To meet water needs in the region, a system was built to provide tertiary effluents derived from an activated sludge/trickling filter system of sufficient quality to be used for landscape irrigation. The system is composed of several components that allows for various treatments and storage of tertiary effluent (Figure 24.23). A tertiary treatment plant filters the secondary effluent (to reduce turbidity and microorganisms) and provides additional disinfection. The backwash from the filters is then discharged into an artificial wetland for treatment. When the water exits the wetland it is discharged into infiltration basins, where it is further treated. In times of low reclaimed water demand (winter) the tertiary effluent may be discharged directly into the infiltration basins. The subsurface aquifer is then used as a storage facility, the water being pumped to the surface (extraction) when needed during periods of peak demand.The multiple barriers of conventional and natural technologies are designed to enhance the removal of chemical and microbial contaminants. Filtration of the secondary wastewater during tertiary treatment allows for reduction of the larger protozoan parasites (which are more resistant to disinfection than enteric bacteria and viruses) and more effective disinfection. In the wetlands, protozoan parasites settle out and bacteria and viruses are reduced by inactivation by sunlight (UV light) and microbial antagonism. Infiltration of the water through the soil results in further removal of pathogens by filtration and adsorption to soil particles (especially viruses).\n",

During this process, microbes aerobically degrade organic substrate, reducing the volatile solids content of the sludge by 40\u201350% (U.S. EPA, 1992b). Digestion temperatures are frequently moderate or mesophilic (30\u201340\u00b0C). By increasing the oxygen content, thermophilic digestion can be induced (>60\u00b0C). By increasing the temperature and the retention time, the degree of pathogen inactivation can be enhanced. Pathogen concentrations ultimately determine the treatment level of the product. Class B biosolids can contain many human pathogens (see Section 24.8.1). Class A biosolids, which result from more stringent and enhanced treatment, contain very low or nondetectable levels of pathogens. The degree of treatment, Class A versus Class B, has important implications on the reuse potential of the material for land application (see Section 24.8).

The mixtures are normally kept moist but aerobic. These conditions result in very high microbial activity and the generation of heat that increases the temperature of the composting material. Factors affecting the composting process are shown in Information Box 24.2\n. There are three main types of composting systems:\u2022The aerated static pile process typically consists of mixing dewatered digested sludge with wood chips (Fig. 24.26\n). Aeration of the pile is normally provided by blowers during a 21-day composting period. During this active composting period, temperatures increase to the mesophilic range (20\u201340\u00b0C) where microbial degradation occurs via bacteria and fungi. Temperatures subsequently increase (to 40\u201380\u00b0C), with microbial populations dominated by thermophilic (heat-tolerant) and spore-forming organisms. These high temperatures inactivate pathogenic microorganisms and frequently result in a Class A biosolid product. Subsequently, the compost is cured for at least 30 days, during which time temperatures within the pile decrease to ambient levels.\u2022The windrow process is similar to the static pile process except that, instead of a pile, the sludge and bulking agent are laid out in long rows of dimensions 2 m \u00d7 3 m \u00d7 80 m (Fig. 24.27\n). Aeration for windrows is provided by turning the windrows several times a week. Once again, if the composting process is efficient, Class A biosolids are produced.\u2022In enclosed systems the composting is conducted in steel vessels 10\u201315 m high by 3\u20134 m diameter. For this type of composting, aeration via blowers and temperature of the composting are carefully controlled. This results in a high quality Class A compost, with little or no odor problems. However, costs of enclosed systems are higher.\nInformation Box 24.2Factors Affecting Efficient Composting\nTemperature. Adequate aeration and moisture must be maintained to ensure temperatures reach 60\u00b0C, to inactivate microbial pathogens.\nAeration. Air must be provided via blowers or by turning.\nMoisture. Conditions must be neither too moist, which promotes anaerobic activity, nor too dry, which limits microbial activity.\nC:N ratio. The C:N ratio of the substrate should be maintained around 25:1, to ensure adequate but not excessive amounts of nitrogen for the microbes.\nSurface area of bulking agent. Shredded material should be used to increase substrate surface area for microbial metabolism.\u00a9 2009 2009Since January 2020 Elsevier has created a COVID-19 resource centre with free information in English and Mandarin on the novel coronavirus COVID-19.

Thus the more that antibiotics are used, the greater the likelihood of antibiotic resistant strains developing.

Exposures to aerosolized endotoxin have been studied regarding occupational exposures to cotton dust, composting plants, and feed houses (Castellan et al., 1987). Exposures to levels of endotoxin as low as 0.2 endotoxin unit (EU) per cubic meter derived from poultry dust have been found to cause acute pulmonary ailments such as decreases in forced expiratory volume (Donham et al., 2000). Chronic effects such as asthma and chronic bronchitis have been found to be due to exposures of endotoxin from cotton dust as little as 10 EU/m3 on a daily basis (Olenchock, 2001).",

(2006), who showed that the endotoxin level in Class B biosolids is similar in magnitude to that of other wastes including animal manures and compost. For example, swine barns were found to have mean concentrations of endotoxin of 4385 EU/m3 (Duchaine et al., 2001), while composting plants ranged from 10 to 400 EU/m3 (Clark et al., 1983). Since the relevance of endotoxin to human health is via inhalation, the potential for aerosolization of endotoxin during land application of biosolids has also recently caused concern. One study shows that endotoxin values measured during biosolids application are comparable to those found in untreated agricultural soils (Table 24.11\n). Therefore, aerosolization of soil particles can result in endotoxin aerosolization, regardless of whether biosolids are involved (Brooks et al., 2006). This is not surprising since bacterial concentrations in soil routinely exceed 108 per gram, with a majority of bacteria being gram negative. Soil particles containing sorbed microbes can be aerosolized and hence act as a source of endotoxin.",

Animal manure would have no or low concentrations of BSE prions except possibly for wastes from slaughterhouses (Ward et al., 1984).

Pathogens are routinely present in Class B biosolids and are capable of surviving for days, weeks, or even months, depending on the organism and environment. Therefore, site restrictions with duration based on subsequent land use are necessary following land application. For many soils, contamination of aquifers due to vertical migration of pathogens from land-applied biosolids is unlikely because of the sorption of viruses and the soil filtration potential for larger pathogens. In coarse textured, sandy soil or high-permeability karst topography, however, groundwater contamination events are possible.",

The period of confinement was a transitory phase followed by a return to pasture, after such management activities as milking or shearing. However, animal production is occurring in increasingly controlled environments owing to the success of efforts to raise productivity and diminish climatic, feeding, and mortality variables. Larger numbers of animals are being raised in concentrated animal feeding operations or CAFOs\u2014principally, feedlots, dairies, swine operations, poultry houses, and intensive aquaculture. The number of CAFOs more than doubled from 1982 to 1997, increasing from 5,000 to 11,200. Almost every county in the United States has a CAFO with more than 10,000 animals. This shift in production methods has changed the age-old method of reincorporation of animal wastes as manure on the farm where it was produced. Specialization has largely divorced animal production from the production of crops: a concentrated animal facility may be located far from crop production, and the same family (or the same corporation) may not pursue the two types of production. The production of large numbers of animals on a small land base has resulted in the stockpiling of wastes at specific locations, the construction of large waste-storage ponds, and oftentimes, waste applications to land in excess of agronomic crop needs.",
