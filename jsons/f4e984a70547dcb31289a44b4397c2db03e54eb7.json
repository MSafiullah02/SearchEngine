To improve future preparations for high-consequence infectious diseases, it was important to understand factors that affected PPE selection and training in the context of the EVD outbreak. Semistructured interviews were conducted with HCP involved with decision-making during EVD preparations at acute care hospitals in the Chicago, IL area to gather information about the PPE selection and training process. HCP who received training were surveyed about elements of training and their perceived impact and overall experience by email invitation. A total of 28 HCP from 15 hospitals were interviewed, and 55 HCP completed the survey. Factors affecting PPE selection included: changing guidance, vendor supply, performance evaluations, and perceived risk and comfort for HCP. Cost did not affect selection. PPE acquisition challenges were mitigated by: sharing within hospital networks, reusing PPE during training, and improvising with existing PPE stock. Selected PPE ensembles were similar across sites. Training included hands-on activities with trained observers, instructional videos, and simulations/drills, which were felt to increase HCP confidence. Many felt refresher training would be helpful. Hands-on training was perceived to be effective, but there is a need to establish the appropriate frequency of refresher training frequency to maintain competence. Lacking confidence in the CDC guidance, interviewed trainers described turning to other sources of information and developing independent PPE evaluation and selection. Response to emerging and/or high consequence infectious diseases would be enhanced by transparent, risk-based guidance for PPE selection and training that addresses protection level, ease of use, ensembles, and availability.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Ebola virus disease; healthcare personnel training; high-consequence infections; occupational health; personal protective equipment; qualitative research; standard precautions", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Though the last major threat of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the United States occurred in 2014-2015, acute care hospitals must remain prepared to respond to outbreaks of high-consequence infections. Although classified as low global risk, the current EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Congo), combined with the recurring emergence of high-consequence infections (e.g., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome [SAR] , Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, 2009 H1N1 influenza), highlights the need for ongoing preparations. [1] Healthcare personnel (HCP) are particularly vulnerable to occupationally-acquired infection during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, including EVD and SARS owing, perhaps, to uncertainty about the route of transmission and necessary personal protective equipment. [2, 3] After the infection of two HCP with EVD, for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revised their recommendation for personal protective equipment (PPE) to eliminate skin exposure, though PPE guidance continued to be updated through 2016. [4, 5] The purpose of this study was to understand how acute care hospitals in the Chicago, Illinois area prepared for the 2014-2015 EVD outbreak, focusing on issues related to occupational health. More specifically, questions included: 1) how PPE ensembles were selected, 2) considerations for PPE acquisition and use, and 3) how training in the use of PPE ensembles and EVD patient care was developed and delivered.

[19] [20] [21] [22] There remains, however, a need to provide further guidance on how to evaluate ensembles, not just individual pieces of PPE, for their level of protection against infectious diseases and for their comfort and usability.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1516, "end": 1520, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1521, "end": 1525, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1530, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1531, "end": 1535, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the face of PPE shortages and changing PPE guidance, most hospitals utilized multiple sources of information and improvised to select PPE ensembles that met their needs. This approach is consistent with the spirit of standard precautions. Standard precautions require HCP to perform specific behaviors (e.g., hand hygiene), select PPE and use work practices that are appropriate to the nature of anticipated contact with body fluids. [23] Application of standard precautions to the care of a symptomatic EVD patient leads to the enhanced PPE ensemble ultimately recommended by the CDC. More specifically, given the large volumes of body fluid emitted in late-stage EVD and the large number of sites where Ebola virus may initiate infection, it is necessary to protect the dermis, facial mucous membranes and (controversially) the respiratory tract from contact with patients' bodily fluids. [24] [25] [26] [27] Furthermore, the high EVD mortality rate observed in Africa requires a precautionary approach to worker protection. [28] In this context, standard precautions would identify the need for fluid-impermeable PPE to protect the entirety of the dermis, the mucous membranes, and the respiratory tract. The lower rates of EVD mortality observed in the United States and Europe and improved understanding of virus shedding in the early stages of EVD could allow a change in the PPE ensemble under the standard precautions framework, such as the two-tier, symptom-based, PPE recommendations. [29, 30] The reliance on PPE to protect HCP from occupationally-acquired infectious diseases is unfortunate, as PPE is the lowest strategy in the hierarchy of controls. Research objectives for this study were focused on topics related to PPE, so other types of control strategies employed were not explore with interviewed trainers, but a few surveyed trainees described receiving training in electronic devices to reduce patient contact, such as telemedicine equipment or Bluetooth TM stethoscopes. Since the 2014-2015 EVD outbreak, there has been evaluation of the environment and how it contributes to risk and can be optimized for protection of HCP. [31] There should be increased efforts to identify engineering and administrative controls to reduce pathogen emission and limit pathogen transport through the environment. Until that time, however, it is critical that HCP have access to and correctly use ensembles of PPE that effectively interrupt disease transmission.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 437, "end": 441, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 894, "end": 898, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 899, "end": 903, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 904, "end": 908, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 909, "end": 913, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1030, "end": 1034, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1498, "end": 1502, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1503, "end": 1506, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2152, "end": 2156, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Hands-on practice was the most common modality for training in PPE donning/doffing and EVD patient care activities described in our sample and was valued by trainees.

[32] [33] [34] Hands-on training also offers opportunity for evaluation, which is particularly important when self-perceived proficiency is not correlated with performance, such as has been observed for doffing of PPE ensembles. [35] Hands-on training can provide real-time feedback to correct behaviors in the moment with observer interventions or surrogates for contamination. [36, 37] In this sample, skills maintenance training was limited and primarily occurred at ETCs. A barrier identified was debate over the appropriate frequency of training, though surveyed trainees who wanted refresher training, wanted it to occur 1-2 times annually. The annual interval for many occupational health trainings is driven by logistical concerns rather than evidence of skill retention.

While this study used a stratified random sampling scheme to identify hospitals for recruitment of interviewed trainers to help ensure that varied experiences were represented, individuals declined to participate or were not responsive to recruitment efforts. Some individuals specifically cited negative experiences during the EVD preparations as a reason to not participate, which may have led to a bias in our sample towards individuals with positive experiences. However, all interviewed trainers described the period of the 2014-2015 EVD outbreak as extremely stressful, and some described negative experiences. Amongst our sample of interviewed trainers, however, there was consistency among responses, suggesting that saturation was reached for many of our questions, despite the modest sample size. The trainee survey was distributed through referral sampling, and received a small number of responses, but there is no reason to believe that interviewed trainers distributed the survey to a specific subset of potentially eligible colleagues. Given the limited sample size, inferences from the survey were limited, but findings were consistent with interviewed trainers. This mixed methods approachan effort to triangulate the true experience of HCP involved in EVD preparationsis the strength of the research approach.

Hospitals were able to improvise and identify other sources of information to guide PPE selection in the face of dissatisfaction with initial CDC recommendations, using an approach consistent with the philosophy of standard precautions. Occupational health agencies could and should fill the need for guidance for PPE selection and evaluation that is relevant to diverse infectious diseases, and acknowledge the need to consider: protection level, ease of use, ensembles, and availability.
