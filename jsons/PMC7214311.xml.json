While most grand challenges are by nature longstanding and call for multiyear, coordinated efforts among corporations, governments, charities, and other nongovernmental entities, the rapid spread of the deadly virus COVID-19 in late 2019 and early 2020 emerged as an urgent grand challenge with no clear solution.

While emergent responses are common in the aftermath of a crisis, COVID-19 presents unique challenges in that the crisis is still unfolding, with no clear end in sight. The urgency of this unprecedented societal grand challenge calls for novel emergent responses that adopt impact-oriented, innovative, and potentially unorthodox approaches to alleviate suffering.",

We share a detailed case study of one of the earliest such responses, a \u201cvirtual idea blitz.\u201d2\nThis rapid-response initiative was led by a group of management and entrepreneurship faculty from Indiana University\u2019s Kelley School of Business. The team conceptualized and delivered the COVID-19 Virtual Idea Blitz, a three-day event that involved more than 200 individuals from five continents, 10 countries, and many U.S. states. The case study details these efforts, in which, over the course of only 7 days, the faculty group coalesced around the idea of rapidly applying the best entrepreneurial tools and thinking to generate a communal, high-impact response to COVID-19. Integrating principles and methodologies from design sprints (Knapp, Zeratsky, & Kowitz, 2016), startup weekends (Nager, Nelsen, & Nouyrigat, 2011) and hackathons (Briscoe & Mulligan, 2014; Komssi, Pichlis, Raatikainen, Kindstr\u00f6m, & J\u00e4rvinen, 2014; Trainer, Kalyanasundaram, Chaihirunkarn, & Herbsleb, 2016), this rapid, collective response to COVID-19 was among the first of scores of similar events that later emerged in response to this societal grand challenge.",

Extreme cases \u201coften reveal more information because they activate more actors and more basic mechanisms in the situation studied\u201d (Flyvbjerg, 2006, p. 229). The organizing team, composed of a small group of faculty, initiated this project in hope of alleviating suffering and having a positive social impact\u2014goals consistent with research on compassionate postcrisis organizing (Dutton, Worline, Frost, & Lilius, 2006; Williams & Shepherd, 2018) and social entrepreneurship in the face of grand challenges (Bacq & Aguilera, 2019). The team drew upon existing resources (e.g., expertise, social networks) to bring a novel program to market for a set of stakeholders who were not perfectly definable at the outset of the project. These efforts are representative of entrepreneurial hustle: urgent, unorthodox actions that are intended to be useful in addressing immediate challenges and opportunities under conditions of uncertainty (Fisher, Stevenson, Burnell, Neubert, & Kuratko, 2020). Exploring in real time the efforts to launch the virtual idea blitz, this study seeks to answer two questions: (1) What organizing principles enabled the Kelley School faculty to respond so rapidly to the unprecedented crisis, and (2) how might this approach be replicated in addressing the ongoing challenges imposed by COVID-19, as well as other societal grand challenges?",

First, we explore the Kelley School\u2019s virtual idea blitz as a case study of how faculty members organized resources, identified relevant skills, and deployed the virtual idea blitz to accelerate efforts by individuals and communities seeking to pursue social entrepreneurial initiatives. We provide a chronological overview to shed light on the organizing principles and idiosyncratic features that enabled the Kelley School\u2019s faculty to respond to the emerging crisis in a timely and effective manner. Second, we provide evidence of value creation both for participants and for the targets of the social initiatives that emerged from the virtual idea blitz; these outcomes included a successful digital innovation, virtual community building anchored in a strong sense of collective purpose, and the rapid prototyping, deployment, and operation several ventures. Third, we provide details of the event in hope of spurring other organizing groups, whether academic, community, or professional, to take similar action to address this multifaceted crisis or other current societal grand challenges by coalescing entrepreneurial communities. Finally, we discuss practical implications of the COVID-19 Virtual Idea Blitz.",

The organizing team\u2019s assumption was that, at a minimum, the local student community would desire to respond to the many challenges caused by the rapid spread of the coronavirus, and that students would therefore be willing to assist, perhaps by applying skills such as coding, website creation, design, and social media marketing.

The level of interest exceeded expectations: Engagement snowballed quickly, with 95 proposed ideas in the 48-hour window, and more than 200 highly qualified individuals from around the world indicating their interest in participating through the website portal.

A standard design sprint is traditionally conducted over a period of 5 days in an effort to minimize the time required to solve critical business questions and to validate and then implement an idea. Design sprints are traditionally held in person, as they require extensive, uninterrupted collaboration between a team, usually of seven to eight handpicked individuals who bring different skill sets to bear. The five-phase design-sprint process draws upon principles of business strategy, innovation, and consumer behavior, with an overarching goal of solving big issues quickly so as to avoid idea churn and reduce risks when bringing a new product, service, or feature to the market. Sprints have successfully been applied by organizations including LEGO, Lufthansa, Slack, the United Nations, Prudential Financial, the British Museum, and the Australian social enterprise Thankyou, among others. Importantly, previous efforts had demonstrated that the design-sprint process is highly malleable; for instance, others have previously adjusted the timeline from a 5-day process to a 3-day process. One of the organizing members teaches this process to Kelley MBA students in the course of a 7-week class.",

In terms of providing instructional and best-practice content, the faculty decided to focus on simplicity and, given the difficulty of maintaining participants\u2019 engagement remotely, to restrict all workshops to a 1-hour time limit. While this restriction limited the ability to build shared practices and understanding among participants, it was important to maximize the workshopping time available to the teams. To overcome the lack of colocation, the organizers introduced customized tools using existing platforms (e.g., Google Slides, Google Sheets) so that teams could replace physical documents and the face-to-face collaboration available during more traditional design-sprint settings. These online extensions of design-sprint methodologies were developed nearly in real time as the management and entrepreneurship faculty sought to provide a loose structure that would offer helpful guidelines while not overly restricting teams already managing extreme organizational constraints.",

That is, the objective was to facilitate the emergence of independent teams capable of developing ideas into prototypes that could be implemented to make a significant social impact. Indeed, this was the primary driver behind the decisions to help cultivate a systematic idea-development process and to provide independent teams with opportunities to present their ideas and prototypes to those with the resources to financially back their initiatives. We realized early on that we had neither the capacity nor the desire to manage individual ventures; our skill sets were positioned to serve as accelerants to the diverse and novel skill sets of the volunteer teams. For these reasons, we did not specifically quantify the social impacts of each venture, but we have taken several steps to document and evaluate the outcomes of the virtual idea blitz as a whole.",

In a span of three weeks following the event, team #RealHeroesNeedMasks facilitated the donation of over 21,000 masks (see Appendix C). Similarly, another team, ReScaleMed,5\nhas partnered with volunteer critical-care specialists, doctors, and medical-device technologists to increase the number of medical personnel available to set up ventilators and manage intubated patients. They are currently curating key medical training content to help quickly scale up frontline medical resources worldwide.

In sum, many of the initiatives being pursued through private-public partnerships seek to address the core challenges we raised in our virtual idea blitz, suggesting that the teams were coalescing around some of the most pressing issues related to COVID-19. While the most important priorities will\u2014and should\u2014evolve with changing needs as the crisis unfolds (Williams, Gruber, Sutcliffe, Shepherd, & Zhao, 2017; Williams & Shepherd, 2018), we remain confident that the virtual idea blitz was an effective organizing mechanism for identifying and mitigating the most relevant challenges in the moment.",

In addition, faculty could replicate and adapt this concept as a capstone of an online course on entrepreneurship, innovation, or design. Finally, we anticipate a wide range of applications in which traditional innovation collaborations are no longer available (e.g., in-person hackathons, startup weekends).

This type of action under uncertainty has recently been presented in the literature as \u201centrepreneurial hustle\u201d (Fisher et al., 2020). Fisher and colleagues (2020) define entrepreneurial hustle as an entrepreneur\u2019s urgent, unorthodox actions that are intended to be useful in addressing immediate challenges and opportunities under conditions of uncertainty. Their study indicates that such behaviors are quite common in startup organizations and are necessary but not sufficient foundational behaviors for entrepreneurial success. Similarly, prior leadership research has identified that undertaking unorthodox actions to address emergent challenges may be appropriate in extreme conditions or crisis responses (Hannah, Uhl-Bien, Avolio, & Cavarretta, 2009; Reid, Anglin, Baur, Short, & Buckley, 2018). In the COVID-19 Virtual Idea Blitz, entrepreneurial hustling was evident in both the organizing and executional aspects of the planning team and also within each of the idea teams. Inherent to such behaviors is rapid decision making. Our findings suggest several practical questions organizations should consider: How do we encourage entrepreneurial hustle in times of crisis rather than forcing things from the top down? How might we enable people within our organization to build on their unique strengths rather than requiring they follow a playbook provided by corporate officers? And how can entrepreneurs communicate their ability to hustle in responding to emergent customer needs and market opportunities?",

As detailed in this article, our virtual idea blitz was conceived on a Monday, and the program commenced just 4 days later. Against the challenging backdrop of a global pandemic, the COVID-19 Virtual Idea Blitz was able to draw on the prosocial motives of participants from disparate groups with complementary skills. The core motivation of all participants was to develop an idea to help resolve a social issue related to COVID-19. Despite the short recruitment window of 48 hours, we successfully gathered multiple audiences across academic, student, professional, and funder groups. The lockdowns and stay-at-home orders created for some participants the flexibility to dedicate a short, concentrated burst of time that would ordinarily not have been available. They also eliminated the prospect of meeting in person and allowed for a collective embracing of a shared virtual mindset that may not have been possible if the event had been organized under previous conditions. These extraordinary circumstances proved a strength for our event.",

Kelley Direct has a long tenure of innovative online delivery and is ranked as the best online MBA program in the world (U.S. News & World Report, 2020).

First, while we cite the relatively speedy reaction by the organizing team as a strength, more time would have allowed for more effective coordination of coaches, mentors, and seminar leads. Second, the online portal allowed anyone to sign up with minimal barriers. As a result, many of the idea submitters were not screened carefully for their understanding of or commitment to the multiday event, nor for their ability to contribute meaningfully to an entrepreneurial team. Because registration was left open and the time window was short, teams were formed on the basis of interest and not with a view to the functional backgrounds of team members. Therefore, a registration cutoff and more time would allow organizers to assign teams more effectively. Some similar events incorporate a competitive element, including announcing winners and providing prizes or funding at the conclusion of the event. This could provide teams with legitimacy as they pursue their ideas further. The organizing team, however, decided not to employ a competitive design, both because of the collective desire to see social solutions emerge and to avoid disappointing participants who did not win. This was a difficult decision, as the organizing team also recognized the potential benefits to team members\u2019 motivation and commitment were a competitive element involved.

The organizing team sought to balance these two goals by abductively identifying key themes from the submissions and systematically generating an organizing framework; this is consistent with best practices in qualitative research methods (Corbin & Strauss, 2015). Ultimately, the organizing team selected five overarching idea themes to organize the 95 submitted ideas or pain points, and it selected 11 general ideas that fit into these themes.

At times, mentors called on other mentors for support, whether to join the conversation, to help disseminate surveys, or to identify important professional contacts.",

While we hope pandemic threats will receive greater attention, better scenario planning, and more rapid mitigation going forward, this article is intended to help entrepreneurship, management, and business scholars and practitioners to collectively consider how we can draw on our research expertise to stimulate community responses to a variety of acute and chronic societal grand challenges facing our world (George et al., 2016). Our experience suggests that universities can play a valuable role in linking professionals, students, and researchers in shared endeavors that can achieve substantial societal benefits. This article describes how such efforts can be rapidly mobilized and can lead to high-impact results. In recounting this experience, describing the integrative and community-building approach, and providing a detailed description of specific actions and tools, we hope to encourage and inspire other organizers, to provide them with a guide to accelerate their efforts, and to point out shortcomings they might avoid. As we write this, we remain unsure of the final health consequences and economic losses that will result from COVID-19. But we hope that other organizers, including professors, professionals, and students, can use this article to stimulate their own progress in tackling the evolving challenges posed by this pandemic and the many other societal grand challenges they are sure to confront.",
