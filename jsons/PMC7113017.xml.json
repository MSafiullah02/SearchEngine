We confirm that CoV contributes a large fraction of infections during periods of high influenza activity and that CoV is relatively frequently co-detected with other viruses. The contribution of different respiratory viruses to the healthcare burden in Scotland has previously been studied [23]. Further investigation on a seasonal basis is needed to help elucidate the public health relevance of RV and CoV, particularly since CoV has a similar age distribution as the influenza viruses.

The most commonly detected viruses in this age group were RV, RSV, AdV and MPV (20%, 9\u00b73%, 9\u00b71% and 4\u00b77% of infections, respectively) corroborating previous reports [23, 30]. Together with a recent study that found bacterial-viral co-infections were relatively uncommon in children with pneumonia [31], these findings support the concern regarding the over-prescription of antibiotics in children [32]. That the increasing trend in virus prevalence was most notable in infants (<1 year) also warrants further attention. While it is possible that these findings are influenced by changes in clinical testing decisions, we note that this trend is particularly pertinent in relation to recent European outbreaks of enterovirus D68 in children [33]; investigation into the contribution of individual viruses will be the focus of future work. We further note that, based on the multivariable statistical analyses, the increasing trend in prevalence in children explained why co-infections were more likely detected in the post-2009 pandemic era.",

That nearly all respiratory viruses were co-detected with all other viruses highlights the sufficient opportunities for co-infections. We would expect co-infection frequencies to reflect individual virus prevalences. Indeed, in line with the aforementioned study [12], RV was the most common detection in co-infections, RV/RSV was a frequent pairing, and most co-infections were in children aged <5 years. Our study also reveals that CoVs are relatively frequently involved in co-infections. However, co-infections with influenza viruses were relatively few, perhaps explained by differences in their age and seasonal distributions, or an inter-viral interference [34].",
