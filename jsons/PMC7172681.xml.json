            "text": "Group A rotaviruses (RV-A) are the main etiological agent of acute viral gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide (Aoki et al., 2009, CDC, 2008). The Rotavirus genus belongs to the family Reoviridae and its genome consist of 11 double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) gene segments encoding six structural (VP) and six non-structural proteins (NSP) (Estes and Kapikian, 2007). Based on the two genes that codify the outer neutralizing capsid proteins, VP4 and VP7, a widely used binary classification system was established for RV-A that defined G (from VP7, glycoprotein) and P (from VP4, protease-cleaved protein) genotypes (Estes and Kapikian, 2007). To date, at least 25 G and 32 P genotypes have been identified (Matthijnssens et al., 2009, Matthijnssens et al., 2008, Collins et al., 2010, Abe et al., 2009, Ursu et al., 2009, Esona et al., 2010). Five RV-A G genotypes (G1\u2013G4 and G9) and two P genotypes (P[8] and P[4]) are prevalent worldwide (Santos and Hoshino, 2005, Leite et al., 2008, Iturriza-G\u00f3mara et al., 2009). Different surveillance studies with RV-A-positive samples have shown that genotype P[4]G2 reemerges in Brazil in 2005, and since then has become predominant in this country (Carvalho-Costa et al., 2006, Gurgel et al., 2007, de Oliveira et al., 2008, Leite et al., 2008, Nakagomi et al., 2008, Mascarenhas et al., 2010).",

COA is an ordination technique that identifies the major trends in the variation of the data and distributes genes along continuous axes in accordance with these trends. Moreover, it has the advantage that it does not assume that the data falls into discrete clusters and therefore can represent continuous variation accurately (Greenacre, 1984). COA creates a series of orthogonal axes to identify trends that explain the data variation, with each subsequent axis explaining a decreasing amount of the variation (Greenacre, 1984). The correlation between the position on the first axis generated by COA for each gene and the respective GC3S values of each strain was analyzed for both VP4 [VP8*] and VP7 ORFs studied. We have found that the position of the sequences on the first axis from COA are highly correlated with the GC3S values in both VP4 [VP8*] and VP7 ORFs (r\n = 0.625, P\n < 0.0001 and r\n = \u22120.469, P\n < 0.001 for VP4 [VP8] and VP7, respectively).

The same results are found using the complete genome dataset (Supplementary Material Table 4). CpG and GpC containing codons are markedly suppressed (see Table 1, Table 2). Marked CpG deficiency has been also observed in Coronaviruses (Woo et al., 2007), vertebrate-infecting members of the family Flaviviridae (Lobo et al., 2009), poliovirus (Rothberg and Wimmer, 1981) and other RNA viruses (Karlin et al., 1994). The CpG deficiency was proposed to be related to the immunostimulatory properties of unmethylated CpG, which were recognized by the host's innate immune system as a pathogen signature (Shackelton et al., 2006, Woo et al., 2007). This is now known to be triggered by the intracellular Pattern Recognition Receptor (PRR) Toll-like 9 (TLR9), which recognizes CpG-unmethylated DNA, and triggers several immune response pathways (Dorn and Kippenberger, 2008). Since the vertebrate immune system relies on unmethylated CpG recognition in DNA molecules as a sign of infection, and CpG under-representation in RNA viruses is exclusively observed in vertebrate viruses (Lobo et al., 2009), it is reasonable to suggest that a TLR9-like mechanism exists in the vertebrate immune system which recognizes CpG when in RNA context (such as in the genomes of RNA viruses) and triggers immune responses (Lobo et al., 2009). Moreover, recent studies on influenza A viruses, which have originated from an avian reservoir and have been infecting human hosts since 1918, were selected under strong pressure to reduce the frequency of CpG in its genome (Greenbaum et al., 2008).",
