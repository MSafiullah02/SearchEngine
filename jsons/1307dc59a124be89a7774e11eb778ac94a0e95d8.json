CT cholangiography (CTC) images using minimum intensity projection techniques can be best obtained at the hepatic venous phase because of highest liver-to-duct contrast. Venous anatomy is also most clearly depicted in this phase. Various postprocessing techniques, such as multiplanar or curved reformations, maximum and minimum intensity projections, and volume rendering, are useful for demonstration of the primary tumor and its relationship with the surrounding structures. CTC using oral or intravenous administration of a biliary excreting agent may play a role in the evaluation of nonobstructed bile duct anatomy or diagnosis of choledocholithiasis, but its role in the evaluation of biliary malignancy is doubtful. CTC via biliary drainage catheter may be useful in cases where biliary decompression is already done. MDCT cholangiography is useful to demonstrate extraductal pathology and missing ducts that are difficult to assess on direct cholangiography. PET-CT scan is useful to depict unsuspected metastases, but the sensitivity for the diagnosis of the primary lesion is not better than MDCT. MDCT may be better than MRI with MRCP for depiction of vascular anatomy for its higher spatial resolution; however, the assessment of vascular invasion also depends on the delineation of the tissue plane between the vascular anatomy and the tumor, which may be better appreciated on the MRI because of its higher tissue contrast. Both MDCT and MRI may have limitations for defining longitudinal spread, especially when the tumor spreads along the mucosal plane instead of the periductal plane. Multiphasic MDCT combined with useful postprocessing techniques is helpful in improving diagnostic accuracy for the detection and preoperative staging of biliary malignancies but a multimodality approach is necessary for the interpretation of subtle abnormalities that are occasionally difficult to define even using a combination of all available imaging studies.",

To discuss the value of post-processing and the role of MDCT vis-\u00e0-vis state-of-the-art MRI. To review the pitfalls of MDCT evaluation. abstract: Purpose: To: 1) review the MDCT scanning protocols for detection and staging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 2) assess the value of image postprocessing in staging pancreatic cancer, 3) evaluate the role of MDCT versus MRI in detecting and staging pancreatic carcinoma, and 4) review the pitfalls of MDCT evaluation. Materials and Methods: Review published studies evaluating the optimal MDCT technique for imaging pancreatic cancer, and review published studies assessing the diagnostic performance of MDCT and MRI for the detection and staging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Results: MDCT is the preferred imaging method for detecting and staging pancreatic adenocarcinoma at most institutions. MDCT studies for assessing pancreatic cancer should be performed with narrow detector collimation, rapid intravenous contrast medium administration (e.g., 4 mL/sec), and dual phase imaging including both the pancreatic parenchymal and portal venous phases. Although most radiologists use a fixed scan delay of 40-50 seconds, accurate timing of the pancreatic parenchymal phase is best achieved using bolus tracking, with a scan delay of aortic transit time plus 20-30 seconds, depending upon the type of MDCT scanner being used. Accuracy of MDCT for determining nonresectability is approximately 95%, whereas accuracy for determining resectability is approximately 70-80%. Overall accuracy of MDCT for staging pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 80-90%. Review of CT angiographic images and multiplanar reconstructions improves assessment of vascular involvement compared with evaluation of transaxial images alone. Comparative studies have shown contrast enhanced MRI to be equivalent or superior to helical CT for detecting pancreatic cancer. However, recent comparisons between MDCT and state-of-the-art MRI are lacking. Limitations of MDCT include: 1) approximately 10% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas are isoattenuating to normal pancreatic parenchyma and may be very difficult to identify, 2) a number of benign abnormalities can mimic pancreatic cancer including focal pancreatitis and focal lipomatosis, 3) pancreatic cancer can be difficult to identify in patients with chronic pancreatitis, and 4) MDCT is limited in its ability to demonstrate small liver and peritoneal metastases. Conclusion: Although MDCT has some limitations and potential pitfalls, it is the preferred initial imaging method for detecting and staging pancreatic adenocarcinoma at most institutions. Proper contrast medium administration and scan timing are critical for optimal results. CT angiographic images and multiplanar reconstructions can improve staging accuracy. MRI is comparable to CT for detecting and staging pancreatic cancer and can be used when contrast enhanced MDCT is contraindicated. MRI is also useful for problem solving when MDCT evaluation is indeterminate.",

To outline the different types of CAD software currently on the market. To review the literature on the the clinical utility of CAD and try to predict its future prospects. abstract: Computer-assisted-detection (CAD) for CTC is increasingly commercially available, especially in Europe where regulatory stipulations have been satisfied. The current role of CAD is necessarily limited because systems are only just beginning to penetrate the market. A variety of different software packages are available, but all essentially do the same thing -they aim to detect colonic polyps and then alert the reader to their presence via a visual prompt, just as it happens in mammographic practice where CAD is well established. While this sounds simple and straightforward, in reality the scenario is complex: CAD seems to have a different effect on the ultimate diagnosis ascribed to the patient depending on when it is initiated by the reader. For example, if CAD is activated from the outset (the \"first-reader\" paradigm), the human observer may pay undue attention to the prompts and neglect the apparently normal colon. Because no CAD system is 100% sensitive, this may result in missed lesions. At the same time, no CAD is 100% specific -all systems make false-positive diagnoses and the effect that these have on ultimate diagnosis is also uncertain. Perhaps the major difference between commercially available systems (apart from price!) is the individual balance adopted between sensitivity and specificity. These two parameters are inextricably linked -for any given system sensitivity can only increase at the expense of specificity, and vice-versa. The different reading paradigms (first-, second-, and concurrent-readers) will be discussed. A major barrier to our understanding of the real effects of CAD in clinical practice is the fact that most research studies have determined the performance characteristics of CAD in isolation, assuming that the observer will react accordingly to prompts. In reality, there is no guarantee that an observer will classify prompts appropriately. What is needed are studies whose outcome measures revolve around the effect that CAD exerts on patient classification by the reader. Thankfully, such studies are becoming more common and it is already clear that human observers often misclassify true-positive CAD prompts as false-positive and vice-versa, diminishing the expected performance metrics. More studies of increasing complexity are needed in order to provide data for clarification but sensible and appropriate statistical analysis of such studies is exceedingly complex and at the cutting-edge of statistical methodology. Inevitably, these problems will be overcome and it is highly likely that ultimately CAD will become integrated into everyday clinical practice.",

            "text": "Higher resolution with contrast-enhanced Us and volume imaging for pancreatic tumours M. D'Onofrio; Verona/IT Ultrasound (US) examination is a simple imaging method considered in the workup of pancreatic lesions in numerous reference institutions for abdominal pathologies. Very often, US examination is the first imaging method used. The main advantage of US is the real time examination and the high contrast and spatial resolution of the state of the art technology. Moreover, US examinations enable the possibility of accurate flow analysis of the peri-pancreatic vessels at Doppler studies. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been revolutionized by the development of micro bubble contrast agents. The study of the pancreas is a relatively new application of CEUS. CEUS is different from dynamic CT and MRI in terms of technology and contrast media. In particular, CEUS is the only imaging technique which allows a continuous observation of the contrastenhanced phases, making the identification of fast flow tumoral circulation easier. The high temporal resolution of CEUS is one of the most important characteristics of this new imaging modality. The enhancement of a pancreatic lesion can be followed up during the whole study. Contrast-specific harmonic softwares allow maximum contrast resolution during CEUS studies. Moreover, nowadays, the spatial resolution of US imaging is very high also once detailed contrastenhanced images are obtainable. These typical features of this imaging method make CEUS very accurate in perfusional studies. Microbubbles are \"blood pool\" contrast agents so that CEUS images of pancreatic tumoral vessels (macrocirculation and microcirculation) are reported to have a very good correlation with the pathologic mean vascular density. Volume ultrasound imaging (VUI) is a relatively new technique based on the acquisition of volume dataset of anatomical structures. VUI has been changed by the introduction of automated 3D sweep acquisitions. Automated VUI allows overcoming the low reproducibility of the previous volume freehand sweep acquisition. Automated VUI allows introducing in the field of US the extremely important concept of reproducibility thanks to the possibility of a standardised and objective acquisition during the study.",

Pickhardt; Madison, WI/US Computer-aided detection (CAD) will likely play an important role in CT colonography (CTC) interpretation in clinical practice. However, there are a number of challenges and unanswered questions with regard to implementing CAD into a large-volume CTC screening practice. The main potential benefit of incorporating CAD is to increase the sensitivity for lesion detection among less inexperienced or less skilled readers. However, depending upon how CAD is actually employed in the screening setting, this increase in sensitivity may be offset by decreased specificity and increased interpretation time. Instead of simply trying to maximize lesion detection rates and limit the number of false positive \"hits\", CAD systems should go one step further by assigning priority scores or confidence levels for suspected abnormalities rather than an unsorted list of polyp candidates. Additional challenges for CAD in clinical practice that will be discussed include the ability to handle cases with oral contrast tagging, deriving automated polyp measurements (including volumetry), and issues related to cost and reimbursement.",

            "text": "Colon Cad in reduced laxative CtC: does it work? P. Lefere; Roeselare/BE The possibility to reduce cathartic cleansing in virtual CT Colonoscopy (CTC) is one of the major opportunities as well as challenges in CTC. Reduced laxative CTC applies fecal tagging to opacify residual materials (ftCTC). The presence of opacified materials complicates matters for radiologists performing the examination and for scientists struggling with the problems of CAD in ftCTC. Besides the difficulties in characterisation, radiologists are confronted with increased difficulties in detection. The presence of tagged fecal material may reduce the conspicuity of both sessile and pedunculated polyps. Flat lesions and constricting cancers may be covered by tagged material, possibly improving but sometimes reducing conspicuity. ftCTC introduces challenges to CAD. Polyps submerged in tagged materials can be CAD false-negative (FN), and partially tagged semi-solid stool can be CAD false-positive (FP). Polyps affected by pseudo-enhancement, due to the presence of adjacent tagged material, can be identified incorrectly as tagged materials and thus missed by CAD. The following questions will be addressed: For the CAD software: 1/ What is the influence of ftCTC on the number of CAD FPs and FNs? 2/ Can we improve the accuracy of CAD by changing the sphericity or applying the adaptive density correction and density mapping? For radiologists: 1/ How does CAD in ftCTC influence the reading time? 2/ Does ftCTC affect the optimal reader paradigm of CAD? The term \"double contrast MRI\" does not only refer to the contemporary use of two different contrast agents (intravenous paramagnetic and oral superparamagnetic) for bowel evaluation, this term is also used to outline the white-and-black (or \"double contrast\") effect that can be obtained, on both T1 and T2-weighted images, by using this specific contrast association. Superparamagnetic (SPIO) oral contrast agents produce -in other terms -a very dark lumen effect both on T1 and T2-weighted images. This effect, if properly associated with fat-suppressed sequences and Gadolinium i.v. injection, outlines the bowel wall oedema (on T2-weighted fat-suppressed images) and wall hypervascularity (on post-Gadolinium T1-weighted images) in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), more than any other contrast agent association. In particular, SPIO oral contrast agents, if associated with fat-suppressed T2weighted sequences, allow visualizing the intestinal wall oedema and perivisceral fluid in IBD, not otherwise detectable. Bowel wall oedema and wall hypervascularity are both sensitive parameters of disease activity. Moreover, the negative contrast produced by the superparamagnetic oral agent determines a very homogeneous dark lumen effect throughout the small and large intestines, since the intestinal air and the intestinal agent add their signal on both T1 and T2-weighted sequences, differently from biphasic contrast agents. This allows an accurate evaluation the main intestinal abnormalities of IBDs, including the diagnosis of lesion's site and length, of strictures, adhesions, abscesses and fistulas, particularly in Crohn's disease. The main MRI patterns of mural and transmural wall inflammation in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, as well intestinal and extraintestinal complications, will be shown. The clinical impact of this MRI technique in the evaluation of IBD will be finally discussed.",

            "text": "dynamic mrI of the liver R. Hammerstingl; Frankfurt/DE Over the past few years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver has progressed significantly. Technical advances in hardware and software have allowed the acquisition of images with excellent anatomic detail, largely free of artifacts secondary to respiratory motion. Contrast-enhanced MRI has become an essential part of a liver examination in a number of circumstances. Extracellular fluid space contrast agents are safe compounds in handling and provide information on vascularization and perfusion of focal liver tumors. A dynamic contrast-enhanced study of the liver is performed with a timing scheme that enables selective imaging during the arterial phase, the portal venous-phase, and the delayed phase of enhancement, the equilibrium phase. Fast spoiled gradient echo technique allows thin-section imaging of the entire liver during a single breath-hold. New volumetric sequences have enabled 3D serial dynamic imaging of the liver with a very high spatial and temporal resolution. The key issue of contrast agents in hepatic imaging is to discriminate between tissues that cannot be adequately differentiated on unenhanced MRI. Excellent contrast is needed for two purposes: delineation of at least one malignant lesion or exclusion of malignancy in the liver as well as precise characterization of benign liver tumors. For the detection of focal liver lesions, MRI using breath-hold sequences has been shown to be equivalent or even better than dual-phase CT. Particularly, hypervascular liver tumors show high contrast uptake in the early B 13 postgraduate Course",

Information on morphology is fundamental for accurate characterization of focal liver lesions. Different characteristic features of the intravascular and extracellular spaces of the various focal liver lesions are depicted by extracellular gadolinium contrast agents. Dynamic imaging has also been shown to improve not only the distinction of malignant lesions but also to achieve the specific diagnosis for most liver tumors and to identify benign disease precisely. In addition to identifying the presence, number and type of focal lesions and the possible involvement of vascular and biliary structures, it is necessary to provide as much useful information on morphology and functionality as possible for therapeutic planning. Permeability imaging using computer assisted software solutions provides information for visualizing morphological changes and shows efficient assessment of dynamic MRI in liver tumors. It enables an adequate review of patient studies over time. Moreover, it permits easy comparison of parametric angiogenesis maps over time. Perfusionweighted MRI allows detecting intranodular hemodynamic characteristics in different liver tumors. The time to peak, maximal relative signal enhancement, and the initial slope of signal intensity vs. time curves of the tumors and surrounding liver tissue are to be evaluated. In addition, perfusion parameters of the Gd-chelate are to be measured. Pretreatment imaging is an important and necessary step for the assessment and therapeutic planning of patients with liver disease. In this regard, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI has an important role in diagnosing the nature of liver tumors.",

Standard imaging sequences are T1w GRE with and without fat saturation (which offer a very high tumor-pancreas contrast). T2-weighted imaging axial single-shot TSE with fatsat allow delineation of the pancreatic duct and peripancreatic edema in pancreatitis. MRCP pulse sequences and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted GRE images (preferably with fatsat) are mandatory in pancreatic imaging. They are helpful to delineate vessel infiltration by cancer and to characterize cystic masses. In case of an equivocal pancreatic mass, the presence of the \"duct penetrating sign\" at MRCP (i.e., the duct traversing the mass) is suggestive of an inflammatory pseudotumor. Focal fatty infiltration may mimic a tumor at CT, but in-and opposed phased T1w GRE readily depicts the fat. MDCT imaging has gained increasing popularity for pancreatic imaging because of the 3D-visualization of the peripancreatic vessels. MRI is excellent in the delineation of small pancreatic tumors. Due to its superior soft tissue contrast, MRI is also the method of choice in patients with suspected cancer and equivocal CT or compromised renal function.

Manfredi; Verona/IT The internal lobation and segmentation of the liver is defined by the branching pattern of the structures entering and leaving its porta, with the hepatic veins coursing in the interlobar and intersegmental planes. This subdivision subdivides the liver into two lobes and eight segments, according to the Couinaid classification. At the hepatic porta, the portal vein divides into right and left portal vein branches, the proper hepatic artery divides into right and left hepatic arteries, and the common hepatic duct is formed by the junction of the right and left hepatic ducts. The right lobe of the liver is supplied or drained by the right branches of each of these structures. Likewise, the left hepatic lobe is supplied or drained by the left branches of each of these structures. Because the portal veins are the largest and most easily imaged intrahepatic structures, they are used to identify the hepatic lobes, segments, and sub-segments. The hepatic segments are further subdivided by the intrahepatic branches of the left and right portal veins. The liver has unique peritoneal and mesenteric relationships, which cause the upper portion of the greater peritoneal sac to be subdivided into four perihepatic recesses or spaces such as the falciform ligament, the coronary ligament, the right and left subphrenic or suprahepatic recess, hepato-renal space (Morrison's pouch) , and the left subhepatic recess. The common hepatic artery, in the classical pattern, arises from the celiac artery; this configuration occurs in 55% of the population. The common hepatic artery gives off the gastroduodenal artery, which descends behind the first part of the duodenum. After the emergence of the gastro-duodenal artery, the common hepatic artery changes its name becoming the proper hepatic artery. The portal vein forms behind the pancreatic neck by the confluence of the splenic and superior mesenteric vein.",

This information provides a decision guidance regarding surgical strategies and preoperative interventions (chemoembolisation, occlusion of portal branch). The base of liver volumetry is a semiautomatic segmentation of liver contours on cross-section images using dedicated software. The resulting volume depends on a variety of factors, such as slice thickness, type of segmentation or imaging modality influence. In order to achieve an optimal patient outcome, liver volumetry has to be performed in close cooperation with the surgeon.

Furthermore, the own experience on postoperative diagnostic work-up of these patients is presented. Despite the improvement and refinement of surgical techniques, the advances in organ preservation and improved immunosuppressive therapy agents, there are still significant complications after hepatic resection and/or liver transplantation. The role of imaging methods and particularly of CT and MRI consists of identifying post-operative complications, mainly including biliary strictures, stones and leakage, arterial and venous stenosis and thrombosis. The early recognition and prompt treatment of such complications improves the long-term survival of the patient and graft. Vascular and biliary complications after hepato-biliary surgery and/or liver transplantation are serious and are associated with a significant risk of morbidity and mortality.

The aim of the lecture is to introduce the current status of knowledge about MRI with Gd-EOB-DTPA. Materials and Methods: Based on the literature and on the own experience, the value of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI is evaluated with special regard to the use of Gd-EOB-DTPA as a pre-operative \"one-stop-shop\" examination. Results: Due to the dual pathway of excretion and, therefore, the extracellular and hepatobiliary imaging properties, Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI can answer the usual questions arising prior to liver surgery: Where? What? How many? Also, additional questions about the liver vasculature and biliary anatomy can be addressed. In the future, even issues like liver function and prediction of the functional capacity of the remaining liver prior to resection might be resolved with the help of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. Conclusion: Gd-EOB-DTPA is a versatile and safe MR contrast agent. Its imaging properties make it an ideal contrast agent for the investigation of patients with focal liver lesions, especially when liver surgery or interventional therapies are planned. CT colonography (CTC) is rapidly disseminating into routine clinical practice and is generally regarded a safe, accurate and frequently cheaper alternative to conventional colonoscopy. Consequently, and in parallel with promotion of national bowel cancer screening programmes, demand for CTC is increasing. Although generally welcome, such demand exerts additional pressure on radiology departments already experiencing intense competition for finite CT resources. In addition, CTC requires considerable investment in training and reporting time, placing it beyond the scope of many general radiologists, and attracting non-radiologists with a subspecialty interest in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer; the American Gastroenterology Association has declared that CTC, being a technique for investigating the colon, should be controlled by gastroenterologists. This symposium tackles the controversial subject of whether non-radiologists (radiographers and gastroenterologists) should report CTC and whether this activity can be safely and accurately undertaken. In support, emerging data suggests non-radiologists can potentially report CTC as accurately as experienced radiologists but issues related to extra-colonic findings, IRMER regulations and medico-legal implications of misdiagnosis are worthy of vigorous debate. E-Z-EM have gathered together an eminent group of entertaining European speakers with a wealth of CTC experience to debate this topic, which promises to engage members of the audience by inviting their opinions and contributions to a final vote.",

US is cost-effective particularly if the examination precludes the need to proceed to further imaging with CT and MRI. With the advent of microbubble US contrast, the need to extend the investigative algorithm diminishes markedly with obvious cost benefits. This is particularly noticeable with characterization of the incidental benign focal liver lesion; the atypical haemangioma, areas of focal fatty sparing or focal steatosis where confidence in the findings is rapidly established. In the cirrhotic patient, microbubble contrast allows for the characterization of doubtful lesions; the typical HCC demonstrating intense enhancement in the early arterial phase allowing for differentiation from regenerative nodules. With the follow-up of patients with a known primary malignancy, any focal lesion identified may be accurately characterized; malignant lesions always demonstrate washout on the late portal-venous phase. Following detection of the metastatic liver lesion, percutaneous treatment is now widely available; instantaneous assessment of the success of treatment can be improved with the use of microbubble contrast to assess the extent of successful ablation. When liver transplantation is the only effective treatment for end-stage liver disease, the post-operative assessment of the vascular supply to the graft is markedly improved with the addition of microbubble contrast. \"Doppler rescue\" is particularly useful in the assessment of the patency of the hepatic artery, crucial to the viability of the transplant liver. The use of microbubble contrast in many areas of liver US is cost-effective but more importantly improves operator confidence immeasurably. The use of bowel preparation is relatively contraindicated in elderly patients with multiple co-morbidities. There are reports of fatalities secondary to electrolyte and renal dysfunction and this has prompted caution in the use of such bowel preparations. Our aim is to evaluate the metabolic safety of full mechanical bowel preparation in a subgroup of elderly patients undergoing elective CTC. material and methods: From a total of 613 CT Colonography (CTC) examinations performed at our centre between January 2005 and December 2006, a subgroup of 75 elderly patients (mean age=80.1) who were admitted electively for full bowel preparation and IV rehydration prior to CTC were evaluated. The bowel preparation administered was 40 mg of Sodium Picosulphate Magnesium Citrate (PSMC) over a 3 day period. Haematological and biochemical parameters were recorded 3 days prior and 1 day post CTC and patients' medical records reviewed to assess for post procedural complications. results: There were mild electrolyte disturbances among the group periexamination. The average change in serum Na was +0.2851 mmol\\\\L (range -6 to +8mmol\\\\L). Importantly, changes in serum Na did not exceed 2 mmol/day in any members of the group. Renal function tests deteriorated in 24 patients peri CTC. The average rise in serum urea and creatinine was also mild at 0.125 mmol\\\\L and 10 umol\\\\L, respectively. Renal function objectively improved in 23 patients. Conclusion: Full mechanical bowel preparation is metabolically safe in elderly patients who are electively admitted for electrolyte monitoring and IV rehydration prior to CTC.",

Marshall, D. Burling; Harrow/UK purpose: Superior patient experience related to reduced laxative regimens is frequently cited as a major benefit of virtual colonoscopy (VC) but most related questionnaires are not valid or designed for endoscopy. We aimed to validate a new questionnaire for VC. material and methods: A 34 item questionnaire was created using expert opinion (including 2 VC researchers with relevant questionnaire-based publications), literature review and patient interview. 25 consecutive patients undergoing VC in routine practice (21 (84%) had sodium picosulphate/4 had senna 26 g and 100 mls gastrografin) were interviewed before their examination 'face-to-face' using the questionnaire. A series of open and closed questions related to ethnicity/understanding/convenience/tolerability/discomfort/anxiety/ compliance were asked. Responses were evaluated for content validity (frequency of similar responses) and following statistical advice, reliability was assessed by Spearman's correlation (inter-item correlation) and Cronbach's alpha (test of overall questionnaire reliability/consistency). results: 25 patients (13 (52%) female; median age 70 years) undergoing VC completed the questionnaires. 22 patients (88%) were either very satisfied (32%) or fairly satisfied (56%) with the bowel preparation. 27 questions were deemed valid in content and frequency of endorsement. There was good inter-item correlation (Spearman's p=-0.395-0.795) with a high level of reliability (Cronbach's alpha=0.904) overall. Conclusion: This questionnaire, developed for comparing VC bowel preparation regimens, is both valid and reliable and will be made freely available for use by ESGAR members. sCIentIFIC sessIons / Wednesday, JUne 11, 2008 B 18 DOI: 10.1007/s10406-008-0008-8 experienced observers. Reference standard was colonoscopy with segmental unblinding. Per patient sensitivity and specificity were calculated for both observers ('double reading') with two cut-off points using CTC matching criteria: lesions \u226510 mm (category 1) and lesions \u22656 mm (category 2). Positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were calculated using the CTC measured size as cut-off for triage. results: 15 FOBT positive patients had a carcinoma; CTC sensitivity 93%. Of FOBT positives, 50% had a category 1 lesion and 70% a category 2 lesion. Per patient sensitivity for CTC was 96% (95% CI: 92-100%) and 94% (95% CI: 90-99%) in categories 1 and 2, respectively. The per patient specificity was 93% (95% CI: 88-98%) and 80% (95% CI: 72-88%) for categories 1 and 2, respectively. Regarding CTC as triage method, PPV was 88% (95% CI: 82-95%) and 88% (95% CI: 81-94%) and NPV 85% (95% CI: 78-92%) and 78% (95% CI: 70-86%) for categories 1 and 2, respectively. Conclusion: CTC with limited bowel preparation is an accurate technique for carcinoma and polyp detection in a FOBT positive population. The use of CTC as cost effective triage technique is questionable given the high true positive FOBT rate.",

Della Monica on behalf of the IMPACT Study Group; Candiolo/IT purpose: The aim of the study was to optimize CTC management for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. material and methods: A collated archive of CTC findings in 934 subjects at high risk of CRC for personal or family history (mean age + SD 57.7+9 y; 422 F) was analysed. Data were part of IMPACT trial comparing CTC to OC (Regge et al, RSNA 2008) . Neoplasia (advanced adenoma \u2265 6 mm) was in 174 patients (disease prevalence 19%), in 132 cases lesion was \u2265 10 mm (advanced neoplasia). CTC output was considered to be the diameter of the biggest lesion as measured on 2D multi-planar images. The cut-off value discriminating positive and negative CTC results was progressively increased in steps of 1 mm. Positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were calculated at each step. results: For CTC, cut-off progressively increased from 6 to 10 mm, PPV varied from 39 to 78% (from 50 to 74% for advanced neoplasia), NPV from 96 to 91%. Referral rate to optical colonoscopy varied from 26 to 15%. Optimum scenario was at 8 mm cut-off: PPV was 71% (62% for advanced neoplasia), NPV 94%, referral rate 20%. Conclusion: CTC is a very promising test for CRC screening. CTC cut-off value to activate optical colonoscopy can be tailored to optimise the screening programme.",

Halligan on behalf of the UK SIGGAR investigators; London/UK purpose: The potential role of CT colonography (CTC) for colorectal screening has been stressed repeatedly but CTC also shows great promise for the diagnosis of established cancer in symptomatic patients, possibly preferable to standard alternatives. The SIGGAR trial is a randomised controlled study of CTC versus colonoscopy or barium enema via two parallel sub-trials and is the only randomised study of CTC. This presentation is the first international presentation of results. material and methods: Adult patients with symptoms suggesting colorectal cancer and judged clinically as needing a whole-colon examination by colonoscopy or barium enema (default) were subsequently randomised to default or CTC (ratio 2:1, default: CTC). Colonoscopy was performed by experienced practitioners and enema/CTC interpreted by trained radiologists. The primary outcome measures were detection rates for colorectal cancer and significant colorectal neoplasia, defined as colorectal polyps 1 cm or larger. Analysis was by multivariable logistic regression with randomised procedure as the primary explanatory variable. results: Interim analysis of the colonoscopy and enema sub-trials revealed a prevalence of abnormality of 12 and 4%, predicting respective sample sizes of 1,422 and 3,402 to achieve 80% power. 9,072 patients were registered and 5,438 ultimately randomised: 1,610 to the colonoscopy sub-trial (539 CTC; 1071 colonoscopy) and 3,828 to the enema sub-trial (1,283 CTC; 2,545 enema). Detection rates by each procedure for primary outcome measures will be presented orally. Conclusion: CTC may have utility for the diagnosis of symptomatic colorectal cancer.",

Pichi 1 , R. Ferrari 3 , A. Laghi 3 ; 1 Rome/IT, 2 Madison, WI/US, 3 Latina/IT purpose: To assess the clinical and economic impact of colonoscopic referral for small and diminutive polyps detected at CTC screening. material and methods: A decision analysis model was constructed incorporating the expected polyp distribution, advanced adenoma prevalence, colorectal cancer risk, CTC performance, and costs related to CRC screening and treatment. The model assumed that CRC risk was independent of advanced adenoma size. The number of diminutive (\u22645 mm), small (6-9 mm), and large (\u226510 mm) CTCdetected polyps needed to be removed to detect one advanced adenoma or prevent one CRC over a 10-year time horizon were calculated. results: The estimated 10-year CRC risk for unresected diminutive, small, and large polyps was 0.08, 0.7, and 15.8%. The number of diminutive, small, and large polyps needed to be removed to avoid leaving behind one advanced adenoma was 562, 71, and 2.5, respectively; 2,352, 297, and 10.7 polypectomies would be needed to prevent one CRC over 10 years. The incremental costeffectiveness ratio of removing all diminutive and small CTC-detected polyps was $464,407 and $59,015 per life-year gained. Conclusion: For diminutive polyps, the very low likelihood of advanced neoplasia and the high costs associated with polypectomy argue against colonoscopic referral, whereas removal of large CTC-detected polyps is highly effective. The yield of colonoscopic referral for small polyps is relatively low, and so CTC surveillance may be a reasonable management option.",

Wardle; London/UK purpose: It is widely believed by radiologists that CT colonography (CTC) is preferred by asymptomatic individuals for colorectal screening. We determined whether this is true by establishing the information needs and preferences of asymptomatic individuals via semistructured focus groups and thematic analysis. material and methods: 26 asymptomatic volunteers participated in one of 7 semi-structured focus groups, split by gender. Demographic information was collected. Structured topic-guide information about colorectal cancer, benefits of screening, physical characteristics of colonoscopy and CTC and their performance characteristics were introduced to participants in a step-wise fashion. Group discussion followed each section and participants noted their beliefs and preferences on a questionnaire before moving to the next topic. Transcripts of the interviews were made subsequently, questionnaire data collated, and a qualitative thematic analysis performed. results: On the basis of minimal initial information, most participants preferred CTC to colonoscopy (65 vs 11%), with 24% having no preference. However, by the end of the topic guide session, this finding was dramatically reversed, with 80% preferring colonoscopy and only 8% CTC. Thematic analysis revealed that this was due almost completely to participants' concerns about sensitivity, which was ranked the most desirable test attribute overall. Specificity and personal inconvenience/discomfort were rated less important by participants. Conclusion: Test sensitivity is rated highest by asymptomatic screens. The assumption that CTC dominates colonoscopy by virtue of its acceptability may be incorrect. Amsterdam/NL, 2 Nijmegen/NL purpose: To investigate if different methods of CT colonography (CTC) data analysis result in different outcomes on per patient sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV). material and methods: CTC examinations of 200 FOBT positive patients who had colonoscopy with segmental unblinding were evaluated. CTCs were examined by 2 experienced, independent observers and results were added ('double reading'). Per patient sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for polyps \u226510 mm were calculated using 2 methods: 1. by using matching criteria (matching based on size (with 50% margin of error), morphology and segmental location) and 2. by using the CTC lesion size measurement as cut-off value for colonoscopy indication. Significant differences were calculated using the Chi square test. results: 136 polyps of \u226510 mm were found in 99 patients. The sensitivity was 96% for method 1 and 84% for method 2 (p<0.05). The specificity was 89 and 93% (p>0.05) for methods 1 and 2, respectively. PVV was 93 and 88% (p>0.05) and NPV was 96 and 85% (p<0.05) for methods 1 and 2, respectively. Conclusion: Performing CTC data analysis by using the matching criteria commonly used in literature results in significant different outcomes for sensitivity and NPV compared to using CTC lesion size as cut-off value. This last method however would be applied in lesion size based triage for colonoscopy.",

Wilson; Toronto, ON/CA purpose: To evaluate the value of presence and timing of negative enhancement (washout) in the differential diagnosis of hypervascular liver lesions on contrastenhanced ultrasound (CEUS). material and methods: One-hundred fifty-three hypervascular liver lesions (1.0-17.0 cm, mean 3.89 cm) were evaluated with CEUS over a 6-month period. 81 were benign (34 hemangiomas, 33 FNH, 7 adenomas, 7 other) and 72 malignant (41 HCC, 25 metastases, 6 other). Two independent, blinded reviewers retrospectively determined timing of washout in the portal-venous phase, up to at least 4 minutes after injection of microbubbles (Definity). Diagnoses were confirmed by histopathology or clinicoradiological follow-up. Timing of washout was compared between different types of lesions using Fisher's exact test. results: Washout occurred in both benign (28/81, 35%) and malignant lesions (70/72, 97%), but more frequently in malignancy (P <.001) (\u03ba=.94). Metastases showed more rapid washout than HCC (P <.001); 20/25 metastases by 30 seconds, and 23/41 HCC later than 75 seconds. All malignant lesions without washout were HCC (2/41). Among benign lesions, all 5 inflammatory lesions showed rapid washout and 6/7 adenomas showed washout, mostly later than 75 seconds (5/6). Unexpected washout also occurred in hemangiomas (6/34) and FNH (10/33). Conclusion: Malignant lesions show washout, except infrequent cases of HCC. Rapid washout characterizes metastases whereas HCC show variable, often slow washout. However, washout is not unique for malignancy and may be seen in benign lesions.",

CEUS was performed with 2.4 ml of SonoVue with dedicated software (contrast coherent imaging). One significant frame (in bitmap format) of portal phase was chosen for each lesion and analysed by software (AdobePhotoshop 7.0). Two circular defined regions of interest (ROI) for each image were drawn encompassing the lesion and the adjacent normal parenchyma. Sonography videotape intensity (VI) was measured in gray-scale levels (0-255) through histogram analysis for each ROI. Background VI was set at the same level for each image. A semi-quantitative index (VItumor-VIliver/VIliver) was calculated. Results were divided according to histologic type and also compared with 15 benign lesions. results: HCC showed a median index value of -0.42, colangiocarcinomas of -0.62, metastases of -0.61 and benign lesions of 0.15.

Two radiologists independently reviewed the MRI studies blinded to results of conventional staging, surgery and pathology. MRI operability was predicted based on achieving a negative CRM. MRI prediction was compared with histopathology as the gold standard to establish the accuracy of the technique. MRI prediction was compared with EUS (McNemar's test). A positive CRM was defined as tumour at or within 1 mm of the CRM.

There were 4 false positive and 7 false negative predictions with MRI, giving a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for predicting margin status of 67, 90 and 82%, respectively. The MRI accuracy was higher than EUS 67% (p=0.078). There was a good agreement between the radiologists for margin prediction: kappa score 0.7 (CI 0.51-0.89). Conclusion: High resolution MRI using an external surface coil offers an accurate, non-invasive method for predicting operability in patients with oesophageal cancer. Its use could help refine patient selection for surgical resection. Among them, 46 patients were diagnosed with recurrence of stomach cancer after curative resection but 38 patients had available preoperative information. All recurred cases were clinicopathologically confirmed. Their mean age was 62.3 year-old (range, 33-81) and male to female ratio was 31 to 8. We analyzed and correlated the recurred cases about primary location in stomach, post-op staging and gross and microscopic pathologies. We also evaluated the MDCT findings and medical records when the tumor recurrence had been diagnosed results: Location: cardia/fundus (3), body (8), antrum (21), or both (6). EGC (2), AGC (36).

Conclusion: More recurrence was noted in advanced gastric cancer, initially young age, histology of poorly differentiated or signet-ring cell type, and there is no difference of recurrence rate between the primary locations. material and methods: Five healthy volunteers and 14 patients with functional dyspepsia underwent MRI before and after 2 hours -30 minutes from a standardized meal (350 ml of water, 250 ml, 600 ml total). MRI was performed at 1.5 Tesla, on axial-coronal planes using T2-weighted HASTE (Half-Fourier SnapShot Turbo Spin-Echo) sequences. The fundic and overall gastric volume, the fundus/overall gastric volume ratio, the amount of gastric air before and after meal, the initial gastric volume were calculated; the gastric emptying curves and entero-colic variations of air-fluid content were assessed. results: In healthy volunteers, the mean residual volume and mean final fundic volume were 213 and 62.6 ml, whereas in dyspeptic patients they were, respectively, 251.4 and 82.5 ml. In pathologic patients, the mean fundus/stomach ratio was 0.46 before and 0.38 after the meal. In healthy volunteers, it was 0.75 before and 0.41 after the meal. In pathological subjects, the mean amount of gastric air before was 1.9 ml; in pathological subjects, it was 11.26 ml. In dyspeptic patient, the gastric emptying time at 2.5 hours was delayed in 2 patients (21-37%); in 12 it was within normal limits (57-70%). MRI data were correlated with clinical findings.

At histopathology, patients resulted to be affected by: Crohn's disease of the small bowel (38), duodenal Crohn (1), granulomatous colitis (3), malabsorption (8), neoplastic lesion (4), post-actinic conglomeration of ileal loops (1), lymphangiectasia (1) and ulceration of the last ileal loop (1). CT showed a sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of 91, 93 and 92%, respectively. Conclusion: MDCT of the small bowel represents a valid alternative to conventional radiographic studies and to small bowel methylcellulose enteroclysis spiral CT examinations.",

Halligan 2 ; 1 Northwood/UK, 2 London/UK purpose: Helical perfusion CT techniques are being developed to enable a greater tumour volume to be assessed, yet scan temporal resolution achievable currently may preclude accurate measurement. Our purpose was to determine how scan temporal resolution influences ultimate colorectal cancer vascular parameters. material and methods: Following institutional review board approval, 45 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma underwent a 65-second CT perfusion study: blood flow, volume and permeability surface area product were determined using commercial software based on distributed parameter analysis for three different temporal intervals between acquisitions (1, 2, 3 seconds, respectively). Mean blood flow, volume, and permeability surface area product measurements obtained for these three different intervals were compared using analysis of variance; statistical significance was at 5%. results: Mean (SD) for blood flow, volume and permeability surface area product were 71.5 ml/min/100g tissue, 6.33 ml/100g tissue, and 14.9 ml/min/100g tissue; 86.6 ml/min/100g tissue, 6.30 ml/100g tissue and 14.5 ml/min/100g tissue; and 97.8 ml/min/100g tissue, 5.98 ml/100g tissue and 14.5 ml/min/100g tissue for 1, 2 and 3 second intervals, respectively. Blood flow rose significantly as the temporal interval increased (p=0.008). Conclusion: Increasing the interval between acquisitions overestimates tumour blood flow, but not blood volume or permeability surface. Unless a temporal resolution better than 3 seconds can be achieved, helical perfusion CT techniques will inaccurately estimate blood flow.",

In all patients, a dynamic MR-D examination was performed as well. For comparison reasons, 10 healthy volunteers also underwent the MR-transit time examination. The centreline for 20 CTCs (10 male) with adequate colonic distension was determined for both prone and supine studies using a workstation and the colon divided into five segments. The spatial co-ordinates of each segment were related to the SMA origin by triangulation and the degree and direction of displacement between prone/supine studies determined. results: Mean displacement of centerline points within individual colonic segments was 3.6 (0.7), 3.1 (0.3), 3.5 (1.1), 4.6 (0.5) and 3.7 (SD 0.7 cm) cm for men and 2.9 (0.4), 3.2 (0.7), 3.1 (0.8), 4.1 (0.4) and 3.7 (SD 0.5 cm) cm for women for rectum, sigmoid, descending, transverse and ascending segments, respectively. On change from supine to prone position, overall colonic displacement reflected anterior abdominal wall compression. Rectum and sigmoid preferentially moved posteriorly and to the patient's right and ascending, descending and transverse colonic segments preferentially moved posteriorly. Furthermore, a caudal displacement was found for sigmoid, transverse and ascending colonic segments. There was no significant difference in total colonic length between the prone and supine position for men (p=0.98) or women (p=0.87). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that when distended, colonic configuration change is small and dictated primarily by changes in abdominal compression rather than gravity.",

Kolosz\u00e1r; Budapest/HU purpose: To evaluate if medical students using a CAD system could effectively read CTC. material and methods: Fifty colonoscopy controlled CTC data (with high lesion prevalency) were evaluated by 5th year medical students and a radiologist skilled in CTC reading. Five reading strategies were used: a) 2D reading, b) 2D reading with CAD prompts, c) 3D virtual endoscopy based reading, d) 3D with CAD prompt, and e) CAD read alone using an academic CAD system. The reading time and diagnostic accuracies of the different strategies were compared statistically by a Yates corrected chi square test. results: In detecting polyps and masses >5 mm, the radiologist using CAD prompts reached 0.93 and 0.7, medical students 0.85-0.89 and 5.2-6.3, while the CAD system alone 0.87 and 4.8 (sensitivity, false positive finding/case) (p>0.05). 2D reading by the radiologist with CAD prompts proved to be the fastest reading strategy (average 52+34 sec SD), while the students needed 267+123 sec SD for the same. Using 3D virtual endoscopy, the reading time was significantly longer (p<0.05), and yielded higher sensitivity, but less specificity (p>0.05) for all readers compared to 2D+CAD. Conclusion: CAD prompts bring the sensitivity of medical students close to that of a skilled radiologist in reading CTC data, but the CAD or students with CAD could not rule out false positives effectively.",

The presence or absence of recurrence was proved by biopsy or follow-up imaging and were correlated with FDG PET/CT findings (the presence or absence of FDG uptake) by calculating the diagnostic values. FDG PET/CT findings were also compared with initial CT findings and histologic grades of HCCs. results: FDG uptake was present inside the liver in 11 patients and outside the liver in 6 patients, and all these patients proved to have intra-or extrahepatic recurrences. FDG uptake was absent in the remaining 27 patients, but 15 of these patients were proved to have recurrences. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of FDG uptake for detecting recurrence were 53, 100, 100 and 44%, respectively. FDG uptake had no significant correlation with initial CT findings and histologic grades of HCCs. Conclusion: FDG PET/CT is highly specific and predictive in detecting HCC which is occult at CT for post-procedural patients particularly when tumor markers are elevated. Moreover, FDG PET/CT may be helpful in detecting distant metastasis. We examined a total of 30 female and 10 male volunteers (mean age 53, range 26-80 years). All the volunteers were examined first with defecography and then with a functional cine-MRI. Defecography was performed using a remote controlled device (Siemens); the patients were in a sitting position, opacification of rectum and vagina (in the female) was achieved by filling them with barium paste. The rapid sequence radiographs were reordered on videotape. Functional cine-MRI was performed with a 0.22 T magnet unit open configuration (Siemens, Concerto). Static images with T2-w sequences and dynamic images with T2-Breath-hold sequences were obtained during relaxation, maximal sphincter contraction and straining. The patient rectum was filled with sonography gel and Gd-DTPA. The images thus obtained were assembled in cine-view. results: Cine-MRI findings were: 21 anterior rectoceles, 4 rectorectal intussusception, 2 rectal prolapse , 5 cystoceles, 7 enteroceles, and 2 cervical/ vaginal vault prolapse.

We adopted specific MRI modified values for rectoceles and ano-rectal descents, obtained by a control group of healthy volunteers. Gold standard was conventional defecography and/or surgery. results: MRI identified with both techniques 18 rectoceles (100%), 15/17 (88%) ano-rectal junction descents, 15/19 (79%) rectal invaginations, 2 dyskinetic pubo-rectal syndromes, 4 uterine descents, 5 cystoceles, 3 enteroceles. In 18/23 patients, the same results were obtained with both techniques, for all parameters; in 3/18 patients with rectocele and 3/5 with cystoceles, a slightly higher evidence of the disease was obtained in lateral positions. In 1/23 patients, pathologic findings were observed in lateral position only. Conclusion: Both supine and lateral positions, although non physiologic, allow MRI assessment of the majority of posterior pelvic floor disorders. Lateral position, however, allowed better evidence of rectoceles and cystoceles in our experience. Transanal-stapler-resection for treating obstructive defecatory disorders presents an innovative operation-technique. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate morphological and functional results after stapled transanal rectal resection (STARR)-surgery using dynamic MR-defecography. material and methods: Patients with obstructive defecation-dysfunction were interviewed pre-and postoperatively, also undergoing rectal-manometry, procto/ rectoscopy and MR-defecography. Slow-transit-patients with a defecation rate >1/week and patients with concomitant pelvic-floor-dyssynergy were excluded. All patients underwent a STARR-operation in general anaesthesia. The mean follow-up was 20\u00b16 months. results: 10 patients (10 f, 0 m; 62\u00b112 years) were enrolled with successful performance of the STARR-operation. Preoperatively all patients reported a fractionated defecation, only 6 patients (p=0.02) postoperatively. A subjective defecatory improvement was observed in 6 patients (p=0.02), 9 patients showed a preoperative intussusception, compared to only 3 patients (p=0.02) postoperatively. In MRI, 9/10 patients showed preoperative intussusception versus 1/10 patient potoperatively (p=0.002). The rectozele-size was assessed on MRI preoperatively with 2.6\u00b11.4 cm versus postoperatively with 1.4\u00b11.2 cm (p=0.05). In patients with additional MR-findings as cystocele a significant extentreduction was found comparing pre-with postoperative findings. During rectal manometry, the active pinch-pressure and the pressure-at-rest showed no significant difference pre versus postoperatively. Conclusion: Whereas in almost all patients an anatomic correction of intussusception was performed, only a few report functional improvement, comparable to alternative operation-methods. Examinations such as MRdefecography are necessary to identify those patients possibly benefiting the most from the STARR-operation.",

Gourtsoyiannis; Heraklion/GR purpose: To compare two mathematical techniques for the calculation of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of normal liver, liver focal lesions and normal spleen. material and methods: Forty-five consecutive patients underwent MRI examination of the liver and spleen, utilizing a spin-echo echo planar imaging diffusion sequence with four b-values (0, 50, 500, 1000). ADC calculated colour image maps were post-proccessingly reconstructed using: (a) a standard and (b) a weighted linear regression fitting model with b-values of 50, 500 and 1000. The two analytical methods (a and b) were compared in terms of their precision in the ADC calculations. results: Differences amongst all ADC values were considered significant (ANOVA, p<0.01) using either methods. Post-hoc pair wise comparisons showed a better discrimination between normal liver and focal liver lesions when using method (b) (p<0.01). ADC measurements performed with method (b) showed a better precision (mean CV=3.5%) as compared with method (a) (mean CV=8.3%). Bland-Altman plot showed a 4% increment of the mean ADC values when method (b) was used and a random statistical variation within the 95% confidence intervals indicating that both methods could be used interchangeably.

Lin; Indianapolis, IN/US purpose: To determine the correlation between apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of liver parenchyma and the grade of liver fibrosis determined by liver histology in patients with chronic liver disease. material and methods: 78 patients who had diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) using 1.5 T MRI (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and pathological staging of liver fibrosis were included for this study. DWI was performed with b values of 0 and 500 s/mm 2 . Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) of liver were measured in the right and left lobes of the liver. results: The mean (standard deviation) ADC values of liver fibrosis graded as 0 (n=11), 1 (n=16), 2 (n=10), 3 (n=14) and 4 (n=27) were 118.5 (22.7), 101.1 (16.6), 102.4 (20.4), 102.3 (16.6) and 99.1 (12.0) x10 -5 mm 2 /s, respectively.

No significant difference was seen in ADC values between grades 1 and 2 combined versus grades 3 and 4 combined (p=0.71). The etiology of liver disease did not affect ADC. Conclusion: ADC in cirrhotic livers is significantly lower than in normal liver. ADC values decrease with increasing hepatic fibrosis.

The CEUS impact was classified into 5 categories: no effect (A), benign focal liver lesions discovered (B), indeterminate lesion (C), single HCC(D); and bilateral HCCs (E). Variables like pseudonodular appearance and raised alfafetoprotein (AFP) levels were also analysed. results: The outcome of CEUS was A in 14 (41.2%), B in 9 (26.5%), C in 2 (5.9%), D in 4 (11.8%), E in 5 (14.7%). Therefore, patient management significantly changed (C-E) in 11/34 patients (32.6%). HCC detection was significant superior in patients with raised levels of AFP and in patients with pseudonodular appearance of liver echotexture (p<0.05). Conclusion: One third of patients changed management (C-E) following CEUS. Therefore, CEUS, from these preliminary experiences, could be proposed as useful tool in these patients. results: Hepatic vascular problems were diagnosed in 15 recipients (15%). Their total number was 17 (9 hepatic artery, 6 portal vein, and 2 hepatic venous outflow problems). Twelve (70.6%) of the reported vascular complications occurred within the first 4 weeks post-transplantation and the remaining 5 (29.4%) occurred beyond 4 weeks post-transplantation.

Of 32 tumors, 9 were hepatocellular carcinoma, and the remaining were metastases from various primaries. Using CT fluoroscopy, multiple (mean 3, range 1-7) cryoprobes were placed and intermittent CT monitoring was used to depict the growth of iceball and nearby organs. Procedures were performed under general (n=10) or monitored assisted (n=16) anesthesia. Adjacent structures were displaced away with percutaneously injected saline (n=3). All but two tumors were evaluated next day with enhanced MRI (n=29) or CT (n=1). Thirty tumors have been followed for 3 months or more (mean 6, range 3-12). Tumors were considered successfully ablated if they demonstrated no enhancement. results: Thirty-one (97%) of 32 tumors were successfully ablated. 31 (97%) tumors required only one treatment session. All patients but two were discharged the next day without complication. One patient developed pulmonary edema but recovered fully. An 88-year-old man experienced renal and respiratory failure the day after the procedure and died. Conclusion: Cryoablation can be used to treat liver tumors successfully. CT scan can be used to visualize the iceball and tumor to maximize the changes of treating the tumor completely, while avoiding complications.",

Patients underwent a preliminary abdominal CT and a body PET. On treatment planning, we performed a gastro-duodenal artery coiling. At the end of procedure, we injected technetium (Tc-99m) aggregated albumin through the hepatic artery. We excluded from the treatment patients with bilirubin level greater than 1.8 mg and patients with pulmonary shunt over 20% but not patients with extra-hepatic metastases. On the day of treatment, under fluoroscopy guidance, we implanted a dose of Y-90 microspheres calculated on the basis of liver tumoral involvement and BSA formula. The patients were kept under observation for 18-24 hours and discharged the day after treatment. results: In all cases, we obtained a reduction and/or a normalization of tumoral markers in a period of between 4 and 8 weeks. PET showed a partial and/or total remission of liver metastases. A patient with bilirubin levels of 1.7 mg died of hepatic failure, 30 days after treatment.

References examinations were: barium studies, ileocolonscopy, US and CT, and endoscopic index of severity (CDEIS). The data obtained with T2-sequences were evaluated independently from those obtained with T1-sequences, as for: -disease localization and length of lesions, from jejunum to rectum -presence of wall fibrosis, strictures and fistulas. results: T2 weighted MRI was 98% sensitive and 92% specific for detection of ileal lesions; 80% sensitive ,78% specific for jejunal lesions; 67 to 88% sensitive and 96 to 100% specific for colonic lesions, at different levels. Accuracy in detecting entero-enteric fistulas was 88%, non enteric fistulas 98%; all abscesses and phlegmons were diagnosed. T2-wall signal and T2-signal of the perivisceral fat were significantly related (p<0.001) to CDEIS and biological activity. Similar results were obtained for T1-weighted post-Gadolinium sequences. Conclusion: T2-weighted MRI can be used alone for the assessment of Crohn's disease.",

Lienemann; Munich/DE purpose: GI functional disorders (constipation, stool-outlet-obstruction) are common symptoms. The diagnosis of functional motility-disorders especially of the colon is difficult due to non-existing adequate examination-techniques. Barostat and manometry are rarely used in routine due to duration and invasiveness. Colon-transit-time-, double-contrast-enema-examination provide only static information. Due to great soft-tissue contrast, missing ionizing radiation, MRI seems to be appropriate to depict morphology and function of the large bowel. Therefore, the aim of our study was to cholinergically stimulate the phasic colon motility under manometric control and to simultaneously identify the morphology with Cine-MRI. material and methods: During colonoscopy, a water-perfused-multi-luminalprobe is placed in the descending-colon, and intraluminal pressure-changes were marked over-time. After a 90-minute-equilibration-phase, an MR-exam-atrest (HASTE-sequence, 1.5 Tesla-Avanto\u00ae, Siemens-Medical-Solutions, Erlangen) was performed. Consecutively, bisacodyl (3 ml-and-10 ml-saline 0.9%) were instilled via the probe. Cine-MRI and manometry were performed simultaneously over 24 minutes. Manometry-data were analysed for high amplitude propagated contractions using PC-based software, and MRI-data were primarily analysed visually. results: 18 healthy volunteers (age: 19-62 years, 8 f, 10 m) were enrolled. In correlating MRI with manometry-data, manometry showed 13 HAPCs, 12 were identified in MRI. In addition, MRI showed 7 negative-colonic-peristaltic-waves (relaxation) without correlate in manometry.",

Laghi 2 ; 1 Rome/IT, 2 Latina/IT purpose: To present the findings of 250 consecutive CT angiographies of the hepatic arteries and to compare them with data from literature obtained in other large 4-16 row CT series. material and methods: A total of 250 consecutive 64-row CT angiographies (CTA) obtained using a high resolution protocol were retrospectively evaluated. Arterial phase images were analyzed by two radiologists in consensus using different reconstruction algorithms and the anatomic findings were grouped according to Michels classification. Arterial variants not included in Michels classification were separately recorded. results: A normal arterial pattern was observed in 64.8% of the cases. The most common anomaly was Michels type III (9.6%), followed by types V and II (6.0 and 4.8%), type VI (3.6%), type VII (2.0%), types IV and IX (1.6%), and type VIII (1.2%). No cases of Michels type X were detected. Additional, previously unclassified variations were observed in 4.8% of the cases. Conclusion: 64-row CTA compared to previous work with 4-16 detectors permits to depict an higher number of accessory hepatic arteries, thanks to isotropic voxel, high resolution protocols and optimization of contrast administration. The visualization of these abnormalities may be a crucial point in programming operative procedures like liver transplantation, hepatic resections and chemoembolizations.

Liver MDCT was performed using scanners with at least 4 detector rows. Two off-site, independent, blinded readers assessed images at the abdominal aorta, inferior vena cava (IVC), portal vein, and liver parenchyma. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the contrast density (HU) measurements for the two study groups. The mean contrast densities achieved in each of the four regions of interest were compared and 95% confidence intervals estimated. results: 91 patients received iomeprol-400 while 92 received iodixanol-320.

SOS causes the liver to become friable and haemorrhagic and so pre-operative diagnosis is important. This study investigated the diagnosis of SOS using superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)enhanced T2w GRE imaging. material and methods: 126 patients with treated colorectal metastases underwent unenhanced MRI followed by T2w GRE sequences after SPIO. The images were reviewed by two experienced observers in consensus who determined the presence and severity of linear and reticular hyperintensities, indicating SOS-type liver injury. In 60 patients with histological verification of the MR findings, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, for the detection of moderate to severe SOS, were calculated. results: 28/64 surgical and 21/62 non-surgical patients had moderate to severe SOS on post-SPIO MR; unenhanced images were unhelpful for diagnosis. 26/28 and 20/21 were treated with an oxaliplatin based chemotherapy regime. MR achieved a sensitivity of 87% (95% CI's: 66-97%), a specificity of 89% (95% CI's: 75-97%), PPV of 83% (95% CI's: 63-95%), and NPV of 92% (95% CI's: 77-98%).

Of these patients, 38 presented with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the liver and were further investigated before and after Gd-BOPTA administration at 0.05 mmol/kg bodyweight. Both dynamic and hepatobiliary phase imaging was performed. results: Patients with liver AVMs fell into two broad groups. In 19 patients, a prominent celiac trunk/hepatic artery and multiple regenerative hepatic lesions were present and the overall liver size was increased. The remaining 19 patients had hepatic AVMs, a prominent celiac trunk/hepatic artery and tortuous intrahepatic vessels but no regenerative nodules. In this group, the liver size was normal or decreased and 9 patients presented with RV-insufficiency. Conclusion: Two distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms seem to occur: 1) if regenerative nodules are present, these seem to result from arterio-portal shunts with local overgrowth of hepatic tissue reflecting increased arterial supply.",

All patients underwent imaging examinations, including contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance (MR), followed by core biopsy. results: All lesions were located in the right hepatic lobe and were homogeneously hypoechoic at baseline US. At CEUS, the lesions appeared hypoechoic, without bubbles perfusion. At dynamic triple-phase MDCT, all lesions appeared hypodense both in pre-contrast and after contrast injections, without any significant contrast uptake. RM showed hypointensity in T1-w images in all lesions; in T2-w images, 10 lesions were iso-hypointense and 2 were hyperintense at the periphery, with hypointense central area. After Gadolinium-BOPTA administration, lesions were hypointense both in dynamic and hepatobiliary acquisitions. All patients underwent percutaneous US-guided core biopsy. At histopathology, all lesions consisted of a fibrotic capsule with inflammatory chronic cells and a central core of amorphous necrotic material. All specimens, analyzed with Ziehl-Neelsen, Gram and periodic acid schiff, were negative for bacteria, fungi or parasitic infection.

Five patients underwent hepatic resection and three are alive at two years. All resectable liver metastases were reported in the first year. Conclusion: Patients with advanced stage CRC are at greatest risk of liver metastases and most present in the first post-operative year.

Stroszczynski 1 ; 1 Dresden/DE, 2 Magdeburg/DE purpose: Primary or metastatic liver tumors often arise in patients with preexisting diffuse liver disease; therefore, it is imperative to evaluate contrast agent performance under these conditions. The aim of the study was to investigate the hepatobiliary kinetics of a liver-specific contrast agent in patients with diffuse liver disease. material and methods: Eighty patients were divided in 4 groups: 1. no diffuse liver disease/control group (n=28), 2. cirrhosis (n=16), 3. chemotherapy-induced steatosis (n=20), and 4. cholestasis (n=16). Standard MRI-protocol was used in various scanners at 1.5-3.0 T. Manually defined regions of interest were used to measure signal intensity of the liver and the bile duct before and after contrast material administration (20 seconds, 60 seconds, 10 minutes and 20 minutes). Percentage increase of enhancement was evaluated. results: Percentage increase of enhancement (control group 114%) was significantly reduced in patients with liver cirrhosis (84%) or cholestasis (55%) but not in steatosis. Biliary excretion was significantly reduced in patients with cholestasis (145%) compared to groups 1-3 (1793%, 1409%, 1393%). Conclusion: Hepatic enhancement with Gd-EOB-DTPA can be impaired by the presence of cholestasis and liver cirrhosis. However, enhancement was sufficient for diagnostic purposes. While T1-w imaging of the bile duct in patients with cholestasis is hampered by reduced enhancement, biliary excretion may be characterized.",

Eight balloon expandable and 2 self-expandable stent-grafts were used in ten patients affected by 3-6 cm aneurysms. AVP was used to occlude the necks whereas cut up Teflon guidewire sheaths were employed to fill up the aneurysm sac in three patients with 9-13 cm Giant Splenic Aneurysms (GSA). CTangiography was performed before patient discharge, at 6 and 12 months thereafter. results: Successful angiographic exclusion was obtained in all cases. Segmental splenic infarction occurred in all patients treated with embolization and in one treated with stent-graft. Post procedure CT showed complete aneurysms thrombosis and patency of the stent-grafts in all cases. At mean FU of 24 months, occlusion of the graft occurred in one case.",

CAC is further classified according to its anatomic location and longitudinal extension along the bile ducts into four types which has therapeutic and prognostic implications. Imaging findings or procedure details: CAC demonstrates a wide spectrum of radiological appearances and is characterised using US, CT and MRI. MRI and MRCP due to their intrinsic high tissue contrast and multiplanar capability are more effective in detecting, preoperatively assessing, and predicting involvement of bile ducts, vessels and hepatic parenchyma. CAC appear hypointense on T1W and hyperintense on T2W images. On dynamic imaging, CACs show moderate peripheral enhancement followed by progressive and concentric contrast enhancement.

Geller 2 ; 1 Udine/IT, 2 Pittsburgh, PA/US Learning objectives: To describe the appearance of gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) at US, CT, PET-CT, MRI, MRCP, and ERCP and to review the ability of each modality to diagnose and stage tumor extent. To discuss triage to available treatments according to tumor stage. To illustrate sequelae of different therapies. Background: GBC is the most common biliary tract malignancy, yet often eludes early diagnosis because symptoms tend to manifest at later stages when prognosis is grim. Surgery may be curative for early stages or palliative for later stages with a modest improvement in 5-year survival curves. As only one-third of patients are surgical candidates, chemo-and radiotherapy have been used with varying results. Imaging findings or procedure details: US, CT and MR are the imaging modalities most used in cases of suspected GBC. Usual appearances include diffuse asymmetric or focal gallbladder wall thickening, intraluminal polypoid mass, or a mass replacing the gallbladder lumen, with variable enhancement patterns after intravenous contrast administration. CT, MR and increasingly PET-CT are used to assess direct extension to the liver and adjacent organs, as well as spread to lymph nodes and distant sites. Background: PI techniques use the spatial sensitivity information inherent in an array of multiple receiver surface coils to partially replace time-consuming spatial encoding usually performed by switching magnetic field gradients. The reduction of the number of phase-encoding steps allows decreasing the acquisition time and, in single-shot sequences, the length of the echo train (ETL) and thus the duration of the readout period. Imaging findings or procedure details: Standard MRCP sequences described will include the following T2-weighted sequences: 1) projection technique, 2D thick slab half-Fourier-acquired single-shot turbo-spin echo (HASTE); 2) 2D multi-slice HASTE; and 3) 3D turbo-spin-echo (TSE). The distinct effects of PI on standard MRCP sequences will be described in detail: When applied to HASTE sequences, PI technique shortens the ETL and thus reduces the blurring of the image. When applied to 3D TSE sequence, PI reduces the acquisition time and allows obtaining of high resolution imaging with isotropic voxel size. Conclusion: PI increases quality and performance of MRCP sequences. Ultimately, these improvements in image quality may manifest better diagnostic accuracy. Imaging findings or procedure details: Imaging is frequently utilised in these patients to exclude more sinister pathology including bowel carcinoma, inflammatory bowel disease and ovarian lesions. This educational exhibit will review the literature using evidence-based techniques and draw on local experience to discuss the appropriateness of imaging modalities employed in IBS including plain radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, barium studies and MRI. The diagnostic yields, limitations and disadvantages (such as radiation dose) of these imaging modalities will be discussed. The perspectives of gastroenterologists will also be included in these discussions. Conclusion: Imaging is frequently employed in the evaluation of patients with IBS. Appropriate imaging algorithm will be proposed based on the review of local experience and a thorough review of the literature. ",

The acute appendicitis was classified into following three CT findings considering pathological findings before operation; 1) Appendiceal wall thickening and enhancement without periappendiceal enhancement which were suspected with catarrhal appendicitis by pathology, 2) Appendiceal wall thickening and enhancement with periappendiceal enhancement which were suspected with phlegmonous appendicitis by pathology and 3) Periappendiceal enhancement with/without abscess formation, cecal edema without appendiceal enhancement which were suspected with gangrenous appendicitis by pathology. We correlated these findings with operative findings and pathological diagnosis. results: Ten patients were categorized with catarrhal appendicitis, fourteen patients with phlegmonous appendicitis and three patients with gangrenous appendicitis. We misdiagnosed four patients of appendicitis. Three patients had no obvious findings for acute appendicitis on CT but were operated and diagnosed catarrhal appendicitis. One patient was diagnosed with enterocolitis on CT but operated. He was diagnosed with gangrenous appendicitis with perforation by pathology. Background: The sigmoid colon and its mesentery are commonly involved by inflammation and neoplastic processes. Differentiating between these two entities is a frequent challenge to the radiologist and often requires endoscopic correlation. The location of the sigmoid colon adjacent to the pelvic organs creates a recognizable pattern of local spread of disease and fistula formation. The attachment of the sigmoid mesocolon predisposes to volvulus and creates a potential space for internal hernias. Imaging findings or procedure details: A range of disease involving the sigmoid colon and mesentery will be illustrated using US, CT and MRI with pathological correlation. The examples include diverticular disease, infective colitis, neoplastic strictures, endometriosis, fistulas and sigmoid mesenteric cyst.",

Borrego; Madrid/ES purpose: CT has been proven a useful method to evaluate those patients with acute abdomen because of its ability to display both mural and extraluminal abnormalities. The purpose of this study was to assess the capability of CT to categorize the major differential diagnosis in those cases of acute abdomen that course with bowel wall thickening (BWT). material and methods: The CT scans of 320 patients who were admitted to the emergency room in our institution over a period of two years were retrospectively reviewed. results: We found 220 cases with BWT. Among them, the following diagnoses were obtained: Neoplastic disease 40, ischemic colitis 11, infectious colitis 14, bowel inflammatory disease 30, diverticulitis 80, apendicitis 39, intramural hemorrhage 2, hypoalbuminemia related conditions and miscellaneous 4. Conclusion: BWT is a valuable CT sign in patients with acute abdominal pain. By analyzing symmetry and degree of wall thickness, wall attenuation, distribution and length of extent, contrast enhancing pattern, and perienteric change it was possible to substantially narrow the broad spectrum of differential diagnosis. Background: Laparoscopic surgery in colorectal cancer has been generally accepted because the technique is less invasive than open surgery. However, in this procedure, it is difficult to obtain images of the entire operative field under laparoscopy. Therefore, it takes a long time to identify the proper vessels where there might be major variations in each patient. Moreover, vessels and organs could be injured during lymph nodes dissection and vessel ligation under laparoscopic guidance. Therefore, it is quite important to perform a preoperative assessment of the vascular anatomy using a 3D-CTA before surgery. Imaging findings or procedure details: We performed multiphase contrast-enhanced examinations using a 64-channel MDCT. A total of 100 ml of nonionic contrast material was injected intravenously at a rate of 4 ml/s. Timing for arterial phase scanning was determined using bolus tracking technique. Portal phase imaging was performed 70 s after the start of bolus injection. 3D-CTA was reconstructed from CT images of 0.625-mm thickness on computer workstations by using volume rendering and maximum intensity projection techniques. Conclusion: A 3D-CTA is useful for the preoperative visualization of laparoscopic colorectal surgery.",

Kosar; Ankara/TR Learning objectives: To investigate the prevalence of ILC by CT and to discuss the significance of ILC. Background: The interposition of left colon (ILC) has been documented recently and reported more rarely than right colon variations. ILC was classified as retrogastric and retrosplenic types. Imaging findings or procedure details: The abdomen or chest CT examinations were performed by 64 slices CT scanner in 200 patients who suffered from different clinical symptoms. Among them, the ILC was identified in 3 (1.5%) patients. The upper part of the descending colon was located between the spleen and the left kidney, and extended up to the hemidiaphragm (retrogastric type) in two patients. In the third patient, the splenic flexure was seen in front of the left kidney, between the hemidiaphragm and spleen. The last ILC was a variant of the retrosplenic interposition because his spleen was located more caudally than normal position. For this reason, to the best of our knowledge, this type of ILC has been described for the first time in our study. Conclusion: ILC is a benign anatomical variation and can be easily diagnosed on CT images. Radiological recognition of ILC is important to prevent misdiagnosis of the colon such as abscess and to avoid unnecessary colon perforation during percutaneous nephrostomy or biopsy. Colonic diverticulosis is the most frequent cause of severe rectal bleeding. Complications of colonic diverticulitis include hemorrhage, perforation, fistulization, panperitonitis, abscess formation, and others. The latter occurs in more than 8% of patients with acute deiverticulitis. Imaging findings or procedure details: We reviewed abdominal CT of patients of acute abdomen with colonic diverticulosis. Colonic perforation with intraperitoneal free air, fistulization and spread of inflammation well depicted axial and optimal multiplanner reformatted images using MDCT with 0.6-1 mm of collimation. A rare perforation of sigmoid colon was caused by the impact of ingested foreign body in diverticulum. The hemorrhage from diverticula was diagnosed by pre-and post contrast-enhanced CT, and interventional treatment was done. Serious complications of colonic diverticulitis were thrombosis and gas formation of portal venous system, and perforation with venous intravasation of barium. One case was seen with splenic infarction due to thorombosis of portal and splenic vein secondary cholecystitis because of ascending colonic diverticulitis. , an emergent condition, is usually idiopathic in infants five to nine months of age. However neonates, older children and adults commonly have lead points. The purpose of this report is to describe CT findings of two cases with IS due to unusual pathologic lead points. material and methods: Abdominal CT scan of two patients was performed with a preliminary diagnosis of chronic intestinal obstruction. results: Case 1: A four-year-old boy had asymmetrical prominent wall thickening in the terminal ileum and right-sided colonic segments, and a metallic foreign body in cecum. Besides, there was an intracolonic soft tissue mass representing ileocolic IS in the right hemicolon. Laparotomy revealed ileocolic IS due to ileocecal mass along with a coin. Burkitt lymphoma was determined at histological examination. Case 2: A twelve-year-old girl had small bowel dilatation on CT.",

T2-weighted turbo spin-echo sequences (voxel size 3 x 0.5 x 0.5 mm) in the coronal and transverse as well as perpendicular to the long axis of the intestine at the tumour level were performed. The tumours were assessed with respect to localisation, relation to the peritoneum, retroperitoneal structures and adjacent organs. Surgical specimen were examined by a GI pathologist being the reference standard together with surgical findings. results: Five patients were excluded due to not satisfactory MRI quality (n=3), not verified cancer diagnosis after surgery (n=1), no surgery (n=1).

This study prospectively compares three bowel cleansing preparations. material and methods: Group 1 (n=20) received single dose Sodium phosphate; Group 2 (n=20) received sodium picosulphate (Picolax) and senna; and Group 3 (n=20) received a combination of Picolax and 1L 2% oral diatrizoate meglumine (gastrograffin). Overall preparation quality and diagnostic confidence between groups was analysed using the Kruskall-Wallis test and Dunn's post hoc analysis. Colonic distension scored similarly in all 3 groups (p>0.05). There was significantly less retained fluid (p<0.05) and significantly more residual faeces (p<0.05) in subjects prepared using sodium phosphate. No significant difference in terms of residual fluid or faeces was observed between Groups 2 and 3 (p>0.05) and overall study quality was superior in subjects prepared with Picolax and senna (Groups 2 and 3) (p<0.05).

Background: Nowadays, the \"panorama\" of technical approaches for CTC is expanding offering a wide spectrum of different possibilities. As technology continues to advance, there will be a continuing need to reassess the relative tradeoffs among scan width, image noise, patient dose, image artefacts, breathhold times, and the number of reconstructed images to be viewed and archived. Imaging findings or procedure details: We will discuss the relationship among collimation, tube current settings, patient dose exposure and accuracy in polyp detection of various CTC protocols valid for different scanner generation. We will offer some practical guidelines for CTC technique based on evidences of literature and our personal experience of more than 800 CTC examinations performed on different scanners generation including a 64-MDCT (VCT; GE). Conclusion: A single scanning protocol with identical parameters for all scanners and patients cannot be recommended due to technological differences as well as different clinical indications to CTC. What is possible to do is to offer general guidelines according to the consensus statement on CTC. Collimation should not be larger than 5 mm for SSCT and no larger than 3 mm for MDCT.

We compared CTCs of those who consumed oral diatrizoate meglumine (Gastrograffin) for 2 hours before CTC with those who consumed Gastrograffin for 24 hours before CTC. material and methods: This was a prospective study of 40 patients, who received full bowel preparation with sodium picosulphate and oral labelling with 1000 cc 2% Gastrograffin. Group 1 (n=20) consumed 1000 cc Gastrograffin over 2 hours before CTC. Group 2 (n=20) consumed 1000 cc Gastrograffin over 24 hours before CTC. Using axial images, the colon was evaluated by segment and analysed regarding colonic distension, residual fluid/stool, and quality of labelling of fluid/stool using 5-point scales. Overall examination quality and overall diagnostic confidence for each group was also analysed. Statistical analysis included Mann Whitney U test. p<0.05 was taken as statistically significant. results: 100% cases had good/excellent colonic distension.

The objective of the current study was to determine the value of Magnetic Resonance Colonography (MRC) for the assessment of colonic Crohn's Disease (CD). material and methods: 36 patients with CD underwent colonoscopy and MRC using a 3.0 T unit. T2-weighted and pre-and post-contrast-enhanced T1weighted sequences were acquired. Endoscopic lesions were graded as inactive, mild/moderate and severe. The MRC parameters evaluated in each colonic segment were: wall thickness, pre-and post-contrast wall signal intensity, relative contrast enhancement, edema, ulcers, pseudopolyps, and adenopathies. results: A total of 121 colonic segments were available for evaluation (inactive n: 71, mild/moderate n: 29, severe n: 21). Significant differences were found between inactive and mild/moderate disease, and between the latter and severe disease for wall thickness, post-contrast wall enhancement, relative enhancement, edema and ulcers. Linear logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the variables with independent predictive value for determining disease activity and severity were wall thickness, signal intensity after contrast, % enhancement and presence of ulcers. Applying the corresponding coefficients, the sensitivity and specificity for detecting disease activity were 0.83 and 0.84, and for detection of severe lesions 0.96 and 0.93, respectively.",

Piccione, B. Beomonte Zobel; Rome/IT purpose: Crohn's Disease (CD) contemporary affects small and large bowels. We propose an alternative method to distend and evaluate the whole unprepared bowel: dark-lumen-MR technique with oral administration of polietilenglicole (PEG) in 2 stages. material and methods: 45 patients with suspected CD have been examined, with no previous intestinal cleansing. They were asked to drink twice 1.5 liters of a polietilenglicole solution: 2-4 hours and 45 minutes before MR examination. A darklumen-MR protocol has been acquired on a 1.5 Tesla magnet: T2-weighted and True-FISP sequences on axial and coronal planes and T1-weighted sequences, in basal condition and after paramagnetic contrast e.v. administration on axial plane. Grading of bowel distension, cleansing and parietal inflammation (active, inactive, negative) was defined for each segment using conventional colonoscopy, postbiopsy histopathology results and serological tests findings as gold standard. results: Only 9% of bowel segments were not correctly distended (mainly the jejunum), and 7% of colonic segments where hindered by feces (especially distal colon). In 26 pathologic segments, a complete correlation of presence and location of flogosis has been evidenced, but in 6 segments (all in the same patient) the grading of flogosis was not correct. Conclusion: Whole bowel assessment with \"2 steps\" distension is feasible, satisfying, does not need for particular colonic preparation and does not present the discomfort of direct retrograde colonic water distension, especially when perianal complications are present. The aim of our study is to assess the capability of dark-lumen MR-Colonography (MRC) in detecting the number, localization and complication of colorectal diverticula (CD) obviating colonic cleansing and manual colon retrograde distension. material and methods: A total of 29 symptomatic patients, referred for conventional colonography and/or CTC underwent MRC without any previous bowel cleansing and manual distension. MRC protocol was acquired on a 1.5 T scanner with high-performing gradients on axial and coronal planes using T2weighted (TSE and HASTE), unspoiled (true-FISP) and spoiled (FLASH) GRE T1weighted sequences. Spoiled GRE was acquired before and 75 seconds after intravenous administration of paramagnetic contrast agent. MR examinations were analysed on per-patient basis and on a per-segment basis (ascending, transverse and descending colon and rectum) that were stratified per number of diverticula (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-10, >10). results: The \"per-patient\" analysis demonstrated a good diagnostic accuracy subordinated to patient compliance (93%), whereas the \"per-segment\" defines a higher representation of diverticula in sigmoid tract (65% of patients) than in cecum and rectum (0% of patients). Conclusion: Dark-lumen MRC is a promising modality with high accuracy for detecting CD. This technique, moreover, overcomes the risk of diverticulum perforation, inherent in retrograde bowel distension and that of ionising radiation. Belfast/UK, 2 Craigavon/UK purpose: With the advent of 'conservative' therapies including photodynamic therapy and endoscopic mucosal resection for Barrett's oesophagitis and high grade dysplasia, accurate staging has become increasingly important. We report our experience in these patients with EUS. material and methods: Retrospective review of 25 consecutive patients referred for EUS for assessment of Barrett's with high grade dysplasia and/or stricture or polyp. The findings were compared with subsequent oesophagectomy histology or endoscopy and biopsy follow up. results: 9 patients were found to have invasive tumour on EUS and this was confirmed in all 9 either by oesophagectomy, OGD and oncology follow up, or by endoscopic mucosal resection. 8 patients underwent oesophagectomy, 6 for invasive tumour and 2 for dysplasia only, with pathological agreement with EUS findings in 7/8. The one discrepancy was a EUS case of thickening only with no invasion, but pathology showed a T1 lesion. 13 patients with no evidence of invasion were followed up with OGD and biopsy, with or without photodynamic therapy, for an average of 15.8 months, with no cases of 'missed' invasion occurring. Therefore, in our experience, the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of EUS in complex Barrett's was 90, 100 and 100%, respectively. Conclusion: EUS is valuable in the assessment of Barrett's oesophagitis and high grade dysplasia where conservative therapy is increasingly being used.",

B\u00e9rczi; Budapest/HU purpose: Assessment of the role of computed tomography perfusion (CTP) study for differentiation between malignant and benign mediastinal and retroiperitoneal lymph nodes in oesophageal cancer. material and methods: A prospective study was conducted on 14 consecutive patients (9 M, 5 F aged 37-62) with histologically proven esophageal cancer. Perfusion study was done after contrast-enhanced conventional chest and abdominal MDCT study. Perfusion values were calculated by using a modified deconvolution-based analysis, with the application of CT perfusion software. Region of interest placed over the biggest lymph node was found in a previous CT study. Postprocessing-generated maps showed perfusion (P), peak enhancement intensity, time to peak (TTP), blood flow (BF), blood volume ml/ 100ml (BV). Data were statistically analyzed with Wilcoxon sign test, and results were compared with histopathological findings. results: Histologically proven malignant lymph nodes perfusion values were significantly different from those in benign lymph nodes. The mean values of BF were 11.7 (\u00b1 3.1), BV was 2.7 (\u00b1 0.26) and TTP was 22 sec (\u00b1 3.9 sec). Compared to non-malignant nodes, the malignant ones showed significantly lower BF and BV values (p<0.009). The accuracy of detecting malignant nodes was 87%, sensitivity 92%, specificity 84%, positive predictive value 91.5%, and negative predictive value 75.9%.

Background: We reviewed the radiological findings from 14 patients who have accidentally ingested foreign bodies causing oesophageal perforation. Different agents may be responsible for these rare but severe conditions. In our experience, we studied very singular ingestions as chickenbone, fishbone, small toys and perforations due to iatrogenic injuries. Imaging findings or procedure details: All cases have been approached with a conventional radiography of the chest, followed by an oesophagogastric digital fluoroscopic study performed in emergency with high frame velocity (3/sec), during oral administration of iodinated contrast medium. When necessary, we completed our conventional examination with MDCT scans useful for identifying more exactly contrast medium spreadings. Radiological findings identified with conventional techinque were: irregularity of oesophageal wall, fat stranding, contrast spreadings, pneumomediastinum, and broncho-oesophageal fistulas. The clinical features of OP are often non-specific and radiological imaging is essential to achieve early diagnosis and reduce mortality. Knowledge of the usefulness of various imaging modalities, the radiological features of OP, and of management options is crucial to achieve accurate diagnosis, interpret follow-up studies, and guide management.

Imaging findings or procedure details: We illustrate a spectrum of direct and indirect signs of mesenteric and bowel wall injury and associated findings in the trauma setting. The direct signs include bowel wall defect, extraluminal air and extravasation of oral contrast material. The indirect signs are non-specific but their presence is suspicious for BI and include diffuse or isolated wall thickening, intramural air, abnormal bowel wall enhancement, free fluid and adjacent mesenteric hematoma. MDCT imaging patterns were correlated with surgical findings on a patient-by-patient basis.

Pathologies can also be subdivided according to their imaging appearances, which include ill defined/infiltrative processes, cystic masses and solid lesions. Conclusion: It is important for abdominal radiologists to have a thorough understanding of mesenteric anatomy and pathology.

We describe the imaging findings of a wide spectrum of GISTs with an emphasis on unusual findings and pathologic correlation. Imaging findings or procedure details: CT imaging of small GISTs typically show round and homogeneous low-density intramural mass with intact overlying mucosa, but necrosis, cavity formation and exophytic growing pattern are commonly noted in large GISTs. Calcification, cystic necrosis in small GIST, circumferential mural thickening pattern mimic lymphoma, extra-gastrointestinal GISTs, and atypical findings of hepatic metastasis are unusual radiologic findings of GISTs. Conclusion: Radiologic findings of GISTs are various, so it is important that radiologists are familiar with these findings. An awareness of the various radiologic manifestations in GISTs can help ensure a correct diagnosis and proper management. Classically upper GI series were the method of choice, but CT has an increasing role in the evaluation of these cases. Imaging findings or procedure details: In acute setting, chest and abdominal radiographs are performed looking for signs of perforation. Acute-subacute lesions can be seen as atony, dilatation, sloughing and irregular contours, thickened and irregular folds and ulceration in upper GI series. CT can depict more accurately the extension of mural lesions and extradigestive findings. These radiographic findings reflect mucosal destruction and intramural edema and/or hemorrhage.

Hepatobiliary complications include gallbladder disease, fatty infiltration of the liver, bile duct abnormalities, focal biliary fibrosis and multinodular cirrhosis and associated portal hypertension. Pancreas involvement may result in acute pancreatitis, fatty replacement, calcification, cysts, duct abnormalities and carcinoma. We provide a pictorial review of the imaging findings. Thessaloniki/GR, 2 Ankara/TR Learning objectives: MP is a chronic, tumor-like, aseptic inflammatory process of the adipose tissue of the mesentery. Although MP is a rather rare condition, the use of abdominal CT as well as the awareness of modern radiologists about this pathology and its specific signs has made the diagnosis more frequent. The objective of our study was to describe the specific signs of MP with CT. Background: We retrospectively evaluated 1500 abdominal CTs of adult patients (between ages 51 and 85) that were performed over a period of 5 years in our department. Patients with ascites, abdominal trauma, malignant tumors of the pancreas and pathology of the lymphatic system were excluded. Imaging findings or procedure details: In our study, 45 of the abdominal CTs showed signs of mesenteric panniculitis (MP) (3%). The characteristic CT signs of MP are: hyperattenuation of the mesenteric adipose tissue was observed in 100%, \"fat-halo\" sign in 60%, nodules (diameter <10 mm) in 84.4%, and pseudocapsule in 18%. The exact etiology of the disease is not known. Yet studies have suggested that MP consists of a paraneoplasmatic response. Conclusion: Abdominal CT is the radiologic method of choice for the diagnosis of MP. Although MP is usually asymptomatic and does not require therapy, its early diagnosis is necessary because according to recent literature it is regarded as a paraneoplasmatic condition. Background: Abdominal lymphoma has a wide variety of imaging appearances and definitive diagnosis relies on histopathologic analysis. CT has been shown to be useful to define the extent of disease, assist in treatment planning, evaluate the response to therapy and monitor patient progress and possible relapse. Imaging findings or procedure details: In this exhibit, we describe and illustrate: 1. The CT technique, appearance and implications of imaging findings for disease management in patients with lymphomatous involvement of the: 1. It also provides adequate evaluation of intra-abdominal organs, frequently leading to a specific diagnosis. Additionally, it establishes gas extension and precise anatomic location, aiding in therapeutic decision making. Imaging findings or procedure details: We describe CT imaging spectrum of extraluminal gas on the abdomen, often with correlative abdominal radiographs or CT topograms. The radiological diagnoses were confirmed by reviewing clinical, pathological and surgical records. We illustrate spurious, iatrogenic, traumatic, infectious, isquemic and neoplastic conditions that are depicted by pneumoperitoneum, emphysema, pneumatosis, portomesenteric venous gas, pneumobilia and abscesses, valuing its pathologic and clinical correlation. Helpful hints for differential diagnosis and features with therapeutic relevance are also stressed out.

Acute and chronic complications associated with various common and uncommon diverticula will be outlined. Conclusion: Apart from colon, diverticula may arise from any segment of the GI tract. Symptomatic diverticular disease warrants imaging with contrast GI studies or CT. Imaging allows for definitive diagnosis of symptomatic diverticular disease and can further characterize complications, thereby directing management. Learning objectives: a) To discuss the use of diagnostic imaging in the diagnosis of acute and chronic diaphragmatic injuries. b) To discus some more subtle signs of diaphragmatic injuries which require careful analysis of CT images and examination with MRI in specific situations. Background: Traumatic rupture of the diaphragm may result from blunt or penetrating injuries. Unilateral hemi diaphragm injury is more common with injuries to the left hemi diaphragm occurring three times more frequently than the right. Various imaging modalities including chest radiography, CT and abdominal US may be used for diagnosis of diaphragmatic injury. Imaging findings or procedure details: This poster will utilise a number of interesting examples which illustrate imaging findings of traumatic diaphragm rupture/herniation in the acute and chronic settings. We will focus on the role of CT and advantages of multiplanar reconstruction. We will also illustrate common and unusual complications of acute and chronic diaphragm rupture. Conclusion: Various radiological modalities are necessary to make an accurate diagnosis of diaphragmatic injury and CT currently is the modality of choice. A high index of suspicion within the appropriate clinical setting should be maintained to allow correct diagnosis. Early diagnosis and repair prevent potentially devastating complications that result from visceral herniation through the post-traumatic diaphragm defect.",

Romano; Naples/IT Learning objectives: To attest the essential role of MDCT in small bowel obstruction imaging, regarding the evaluation of the site of obstruction versus the various stages of disease, especially concerning the irreversible ischemic complications. Background: Small bowel complicated obstruction with ischemia is an important event reporting high mortality rate if the diagnosis is too late, that is when infarction of the intestine is confirmed. The usefulness of MDCT in diagnosis of site and cause of an intestinal obstruction is already known in the scientific literature; however, less has been described regarding criteria for specific diagnosis of an ischemia caused by advanced degree of intestinal obstruction. Imaging findings or procedure details: Our work is based on a retrospective evaluation of the emergency MDCT imaging findings of a large adult patient population with proven small bowel obstruction. All examinations were performed after i.v. contrast material administration, without endoluminal opacification. Correlation between the surgical results and the imaging findings (small bowel dilatation, transition point evidence, suggestive or evident cause of obstruction, presence and extension of alterations in bowel wall enhancement) was made in all cases. Conclusion: Various degrees of wall thickening and mural enhancement were listed and correlated with the definitive diagnosis of complicated small bowel obstruction by intestinal ischemia. Advanced ischemia and infarction have been mostly observed in patients with volvolus.",

Mallarini; Cagliari/IT purpose: The aim of this work was to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of multidetector-row CT (MDCT) in the study of mesenteric ischemia and to identify the radiological signs that allow for making diagnosis. We performed a meta-analysis of the literature by evaluating sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic efficacy of MDCT. We evaluated also the impact produced by the newest CT scanner in the bowel ischemia diagnosis. material and methods: A comprehensive analysis of the literature was performed by using the medical literature database of PubMed and Cochrane as data sources. We searched for articles published in English language from January 1998 to October 2007. results: Our search results detected 24 studies that met the inclusion criteria of the 112 overall analyzed. We observed that MDCT sensitivity increased by using postprocessing procedures such as MPR and MIP. The most frequent pathological signs described were intramural pneumatosis, bowel wall thickening, mesenteric arterial or venous thromboembolism, halo sign and mesenteric or portal venous gas. Conclusion: Results of our study suggests that MDCT is an optimal technique to study patients with suspected mesenteric ischemia because it offers high sensitivity in detecting radiological v signs of mesenteric ischemia. In particular, the use of MDCT angiography is very effective in the evaluation of abdominal vessels, giving the opportunity of a better definition of vascular map and its complications. Four scans revealed dilated small bowel loops containing faeces in keeping with distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. Thickening of small and large bowel wall was observed in four cases. In two of these, there were associated peri-enteric fibro-fatty proliferation and lymphadenopathy, a pattern mimicking Crohn's disease, but not histologically proven in either case. Of the remaining, there were four cases of intussusception and one case of chronic pancreatitis with peripancreatic collection. Conclusion: A spectrum of CF related gastrointestinal causes requiring different management strategies was observed on CT. An appreciation of these causes is important for the radiologic assessment and management of adult CF patients presenting with abdominal pain.",

Razack; Hull/UK Learning objectives: HDC is better for demonstration of post-operative leaks and should be used in the first instance to avoid repeat examinations. Background: Oral contrast at dilutions of 2 to 5% is traditionally used to outline bowel in abdominal CT scans. This, however, is not dense enough to confidently identify the site of enteral leaks. Presence of free air is used to assess for leaks; however, this is fraught with difficulties of interpretation in post-operative patients. Imaging findings or procedure details: We used high density contrast (HDC) at concentrations of 20-25% to identify the presence and site of post-operative leaks. We present imaging findings of six cases of post-operative enteral leaks. We performed CT scans for suspected enteral leaks with HDC (Iopamidol 300 mgI/ml, 100 ml diluted in 400 ml of water) as opposed to 3% (Urograffin 150 mgI/ml, 30 ml in 800 ml of water) contrast used in our hospital. Four patients had previously undergone CT with 3% urograffin and the presence and site of leak could not be demonstrated which was essential for their management. CT with HDC demonstrated the presence and site of leaks which was confirmed at surgery. Conclusion: HDC is very useful in demonstrating the actual site of the postoperative leaks. This does not cause streak artefacts in MDCT scanners and in our experience has no disadvantages. We recommend the use of HDC for patients with suspicion of post operative leaks.",

Mallarini; Cagliari/IT Learning objectives: The purpose of this work is to understand the pathogenesis of peritoneal carcinomatosis according to the primitive causes and to review clinical, pathologic and radiological manifestations of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Background: Peritoneal carcinomatosis refers to a wide variety of tumors that present with extensive peritoneal involvement with or without parenchymal involvement of solid organs such as the liver, spleen and lymph nodes. It is a common evolution of cancers of the digestive tract such as stomach, small bowel, colon rectum, appendix and pancreas. Other tumors that may lead to these conditions include ovarian, mesothelioma, sarcoma and pseudomyxoma peritonei. In the last decade, CT has significantly altered the diagnostic approach to peritoneal carcinomatosis influencing also the therapeutic approach in the current practice. Imaging findings or procedure details: In this work, we describe and show several MDCT imaging findings of peritoneal carcinomatosis including parietal peritoneal thickening, tumor involvement of the omentum (soft tissue permeation of the fat, enhancing nodules, and omental cake) and ascites. We include several examples by using MDCT source axial images and post-processing techniques as Multi-planar Reconstruction (MPR), Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) and Volume Rendering (VR). Conclusion: Peritoneal carcinomatosis shows a broad spectrum of radiological manifestations and sometimes may simulate other neoplastic and inflammatory conditions and so it is mandatory for a tight integration between radiological, anamnestical and clinical signs. Imaging findings or procedure details: Anatomical imaging, dual phase contrast CT and MRI including post gadolinium determines site and size, whereas functional imaging with In111-Octreoscan enables receptor density of somatostatin receptor type 2 and 5 to be determined. We present illustrative cases with characteristic images from different imaging modalities to reveal the advantages and necessity of multidisciplinary approach for diagnosis and management of carcinoids. Conclusion: MDT approach improves results in appropriate management of patients with carcinoid tumours. The combination of anatomical imaging with functional imaging is recommended in making crucial management decisions.",

The average ratio of fat change between the two cancer groups was compared using a t-test. The stomach cancer group was divided into subtotal gasrectormy (SG) and total gastrectomy (TG), and the average ratio of fat between SG and TG were also compared. results: The TAF and VF ratios of post-surgeries against pre-surgeries regarding stomach cancer were 0.94\u00b10.48 and 0.77\u00b10.37, respectively, and those for the colon cancer group were 1.32\u00b10.6 and 1.29\u00b10.76, respectively.

Akhan; Ankara/TR purpose: We investigated CT findings in patients with peritoneal, omental and mesenteric lymphoma involvement. material and methods: We searched our archive retrospectively to find out patients with peritoneal, omental and mesenteric lymphoma involvement. We found 16 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma meeting these criteria. CT studies of these patients were reevaluated for presence of peritoneal involvement, ascites, omental mass, organomegaly, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, bowel wall thickening and other associated findings. results: There were 14 males and 2 females with peritoneal and/or mesenteric and omental lymphoma involvement. Mean age was 39 (range 4-76). Subgroups of non-Hodgkin lymphoma were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=11), small cell lymphocytic lymphoma (n=2), small cleaved cell lymphoma (n=1), T-cell lymphoma (n=1) and Burkitt`s lymphoma (n=1). Peritoneal involvement was seen in 15 (94%) patients in the form of linear (n=12) and nodular (n=3) thickening. Ascites was seen in 12 (75%) patients. Omental and mesenteric masses were present in 10 (66.6%) and 10 (66.6%) patients, respectively. Bowel wall thickening, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomeagly were also common and observed in 10, 10 and 11 patients, respectively. Solid organ involvement in form of liver and splenic lesions was seen in 9 (56%) patients. Conclusion: Peritoneal involvement can be seen in many subtypes of lymphoma and most frequently in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Naldini, C. Bartolozzi; Pisa/IT Learning objectives: To show the accuracy of CTT and ddCCD in pts with severe constipation and clinically suspected pelvic floor dysfunction. Background: We reviewed the findings from dynamic digital colpo-cystodefecography (ddCCD) and colon transit time (CCT) in 134 women examined within a 4-years time period. Each patient was given 400 mL of 60% density barium to opacify the small bowel; the bladder was filled with 200 mL of an iodinated contrast medium; the vagina was opacified with a tampon soaked in an iodinated contrast agent; and the rectum was filled with 200 mL of a high density barium suspension. CTT was documented with an abdominal plain, since patients have ingested 24 markers up to 5 days. Imaging findings or procedure details: Abnormal findings revealed by CTT (CTT+) were present in 92 pts (68.6%), while in 42 pts (31%) all markers were evacuated within 5 days (CTT-). Comparing these different groups with ddCCD, we detected: anterior rectoceles (34 pts with CTT-; 68 pts with CTT+), intussusception (36 pts with CTT-; 88 pts with CTT+), pubo-rectal muscle hypertone (6 pts with CTT-; 6 pts with CTT+); reduction of ano-rectal angle (11 pts with CTT-; 15 pts with CTT+). In 45/134 pts ddCCD revealed an enterocele, in 23/134 a cystocele. Conclusion: Constipation is often associated with compartment defects in pelvic floor and moreover this chronic syndrome is due to anomalies of anorectal region rather than an impairment of colonic motility. To opacify the small bowel patients (pts) were ingested 400 mL of 60% density barium suspension; the bladder was then opacified by the administration of 300 mL of an iodinate contrast medium, and the rectum was filled with 200 mL of a high density barium suspension. Imaging findings or procedure details: The dynamic digital colpo-cystodefecography (ddCCD) examination revealed the presenece of an anterior rectoceles associated with a severe intussusception in 52/55 pts, enterocele in 22/55 pts, sigmoidocele in 8/55 pts, rectal prolapse in 19/55 pts, and cystocele in 4/55 pts.

Background: Rectal carcinoma is a common cause of cancer death in Europe and the United States. Its prognosis is related to the extent of extramural spread into the mesorectum at the time of diagnosis, and to the ability to achieve surgical clearance at the circumferential resection margins. We describe the phasedarray MR TNM features of rectal cancer, before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy showing the corresponding histopathological slices. Imaging findings or procedure details: All patients underwent MR staging at time of diagnosis and again prior to surgery for restaging of disease. We acquired axial and sagittal T2wi. Sagittal images were used to plan large FOV axial sections useful to evaluate the whole pelvis, from the iliac crest to the symphisis pubis, and again to plan high-resolution 3-mm-section axial images, acquired perpendicularly to the long-axis of the rectal tumour and performed by using a smaller FOV. Conclusion: Phased array MRI is an excellent technique to preoperative local stage rectal carcinoma allowing to: evaluate mesorectum and pelvis; plan surgery, optimizing a complete excision; decide about the use of neoadjuvant therapy in order to downstage lesions and to perform a sphincter-preserving surgery in those pts who otherwise would require colostomy. it provides information about cell organization and density, microstructure, and microcirculation of tissue. In the intracellular area, diffusion is relatively slow, whereas diffusion is relatively fast in the extracellular area. Tissue diffusion variations can be assessed by the construction of diffusion maps and quantitative estimations that reflect by the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs). Diffusion maps provide images with improved signal-to-noise ratios; reversal of the contrast of these images resulted in black-and-white images. Diffusion maps have substantial implications for diagnosis, targeting of focal treatments and measuring treatment responses. Low ADC values may indicate malignancies or hypercellularity. Therefore, quantitative DW-MRI may allow the cellularity of tumors to be graded noninvasively and assessment of early tumour's therapy response.",

Background: Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) is defined as an intermittent or continuous loss of blood in which the source has not been identified after upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. Whether an obscure site of bleeding is clinically evident by obvious symptoms or signs, or silent and manifest only as refractory iron deficiency anemia, it constitutes a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the clinician. Gastroenterology and radiology provide the essential diagnostic imaging modalities in OGIB, each one with its strengths and weaknesses. Imaging findings or procedure details: Through case illustration, the authors will discuss the role, indications, advantages and limitations of double balloon enteroscopy, wireless capsule endoscopy, MDCT, angiography and bleeding scanning with technetium 99m-labeled RBC in the evaluation of the patient with OGIB. Conclusion: Recognition of the cause and site of GI bleeding is instrumental to guide treatment planning.

These patients had thickened wall small or large bowel segment. 32 patients had clinically suspected exacerbation of Crohn's disease. Methycellulose solution was administered for small bowel distension. Region of interest were placed over the most thickened segment of small or large bowel. In this level, we measured the perfusion of the wall and adjacent mesentery. We administered 1.5 ml/kg i.v. contrast material. The flow was 3.5 ml/s. Acquisition started after 20 sec of administration of the contrast material and lasted for 45 sec at a rate of one image per 1.5 sec. Collimation was 8x3 mm. The slope of enhancement, perfusion (P) ml/100ml/min, peak enhancement intensity (PEI), time to peak enhancement (TTP), and blood volume (BV) ml/100g were determined. These results were compared with CDAI. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. results: The signal intensities of the perfusion scans were measured and displayed in a graph. The graphs showed a typical enhancement pattern in patients with CDAI higher than 350. A good correlation was found between CDAI and P, TTE and BV (0.902, 0.932, 0.954), p<0.008.

Whitmarsh; Bath/UK Learning objectives: To highlight the practical issues involved in setting up and maintaining a successful and efficient CTE service. Background: In recent years, CT Enteroclysis (CTE) has emerged as a promising technique for the investigation of small bowel disease. However, the widespread use of CTE has been limited by concerns over the acceptability of the technique to patients, radiologists and radiographic staff. The main issues are the invasiveness of the technique, ease of achieving consistent technical success, time constraints of pressurized CT lists and demand on radiologist's time. A number of simple practical steps can improve the acceptability and efficiency of this valuable means of imaging the small bowel. Imaging findings or procedure details: We discuss the practical issues involved in setting up and maintaining a successful and efficient CTE service. These include: 1) Careful patient selection, patient information and preparation, choice of enteroclysis catheter and use of conscious sedation to improve patient acceptability; 2) Choice of enteral contrast media, infusion techniques and CT parameters to achieve optimal small bowel visualization and 3) Organization of examinations to maximize workflow efficiency. Conclusion: CTE is a valuable tool for the investigation of small bowel disease. Attention to a number of simple practical steps may improve the acceptability and efficiency of this technique, and result in a successful CTE service. The aim of this study is to present the contributions of the TUS and MS-CT on the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the ileocecal area pathologies based on clinical cases. Background: Ileocecal area includes the cecum, terminal ileum, ileocecal valve, and appendix. The diagnosis of the diseases in the ileocecal area is still difficult despite technological advances. The assessment of the whole segments of the GI system cannot be carried out correctly sometimes. Hence, the radiological imaging modalities gain importance in the diagnosis of the diseases in the ileocecal area. In this study, the transabdominal ultrasonography (TUS) and multi-slice CT (MS-CT) findings of the pathologies in the ileocecal area are compared and discussed with their clinical findings. Imaging findings or procedure details: Inflammatory and infectious diseases that are involved in the ileocecal area, benign-malign neoplasias, ischemic pathologies, various radiological findings such as postoperative and/or the secondary changes in the radiotherapy, important characteristic properties in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis are discussed along with clinical, histopathological information and related literature. Conclusion: Being a non-invasive technique, TUS can easily and rapidly be used in the ileocecal pathologies. It also enables the assessment of the outer-colon pathologies and their complications. ",

Indications and monitoring of new treatments require a more precise evaluation of disease extent, severity and activity. We propose an educational study including all imaging modalities in CD (US, MDCT, MRI, videocapsule) involving bowel, liver, and pelvic floor. Imaging findings or procedure details: Early detection relies on endoscopy and videocapsule if not contraindicated by stenosis. MDCT and MRI help in defining disease extent. MRI has a marked advantage in pelvic floor evaluation, searching for abscesses and fistulas. Whatever the imaging modality is, description has to be optimal, assessing inflammatory activity, combining morphologic abnormalities and enhancement patterns, localization and length of disease including stenosis and complications. Optimal protocols and reports will be presented in order to answer clinicians' questions for therapy and illustrated. Conclusion: The role of imaging has changed dramatically over the recent years due to technical improvement and new therapies. Acute complications seem to be best evaluated with MDCT, while MRI is a major tool for activity evaluation and pelvic examination. Disease characteristics, treatment challenges, imaging modalities advantages and limits have to be known by radiologists. 6%) and was diagnosed in the period of 12-60 months post-surgery. Plain abdominal film, GI-series, CT scans and endoscopy were used during the diagnostic process. results: Clinical findings included epigastric abdominal pain, an increase in body mass, vomiting, access port infection and gastrocutaneous fistula. However, some patients were asymptomatic and their diagnosis was established through GI-series. The pathognomonic sign of band erosion in GI-series is a flow of contrast outside the band. This sign is commonly associated with an unlikely position of the band, which appeared partially or completely inside the gastric lumen. Extraluminal air near the band is a sign of gastric wall perforation, and a fistula may be present. Conclusion: Following the initial tear, the band will slowly grow through the gastric wall and may penetrate into the lumen of stomach. The radiographic appearance of this condition is pathognomonic, and the condition will usually require a prompt surgical intervention. To understand the radiologic findings of these lesions on the basis of endoscopic and pathologic findings. 3. To describe key imaging features for the differential diagnosis of various lesions. Background: Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) offers near-isotropic imaging of the stomach and allows more detailed evaluation of gastric morphology by high-quality multiplanar reformation and three-dimensional reconstruction of gastric images. Imaging findings or procedure details: We retrospectively reviewed the imaging findings of the various gastric non-epithelial tumors and various lesions that may mimic gastric submucosal tumors. Diagnostic pitfalls, diagnostic difficulties, and differential diagnoses are emphasized. Other imaging modalities such as EUS and endoscopic or gross pathologic findings were compared. Gastric non-epithelial tumors include leiomyoma, schwannoma, granular cell tumor, inflammatory fibroid tumor, glomus tumor, leiomyosarcoma, GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumor), Kaposi sarcoma, malignant lymphoma, and lipoma. Other lesions that may mimic gastric submucosal tumors include carcinoid, gastric varix, ectopic pancreas, and duplication cyst. Conclusion: With this exhibit, the radiologist will have an enhanced understanding of various gastric submucosal tumors including histopathology and radiologic features. Familiarity with radiologic findings of these various lesions will make correct diagnosis possible and help the endoscopist and surgeon.",

Pallan; Birmingham/UK Learning objectives: We aim to alert the physician to some previously undescribed signs that can help in the diagnosis of an uncommon condition. Background: Gallstones are a rare cause of duodenal or gastric outlet obstruction. It is usually diagnosed radiologically, while investigating insidious and non-specific symptoms. Rigler's triad of pneumobilia, bowel distension and an ectopic gallstone, however, is seen in very few cases of such high obstructions. Even with CT scans, 25% of cases are still misdiagnosed -often because the size of the offending gallstone is underestimated. If the size of the stone is more accurately assessed, then it is likely that fewer cases would be missed. Imaging findings or procedure details: We describe some subtle but nonetheless important CT findings that will help to better assess the size of an intra-duodenal gallstone. These include compressed air in dependant areas within the duodenal lumen, an area of soft tissue density surrounding the calcified rim of the stone, a faint lucency within or beyond this soft tissue area which could represent laminations of fat or air within the stone, and a focal distension of the duodenum proximal to the point of obstruction, indicative of an intra-luminal mass. Conclusion: It is highly unlikely that any one sign will be seen in all patients with Bouveret's syndrome, but a combination of findings should increase the likelihood of making the correct diagnosis.",

Background: When performed in carefully selected cases, the endoscopic treatment of early gastric cancer (EGC) yields results which are comparable to the conventional surgical treatment, but with lower morbidity and mortality and better quality of life. In spite of early detection and curative treatment, local or systemic recurrence can develop in various locations of the abdomen and pelvic through the several routes. In this exhibit, we will present the recurrence pattern and site, which demonstrated on follow up CT after endoscopic treatment of EGC. Emphasis lay on analysis of missed lesion which was not identified on routine preoperative CT or follow up CT, especially lymph node metastasis. Imaging findings or procedure details: The main pattern of tumor recurrence after endoscopic treatment of EGC which was presented on follow up CT was as follows: local recurrence of stomach, lymph nodes, peritoneal seeding, hematogeneous metastasis including the liver, lung, or bone, and rare unusual metastasis.

There was no vomiting or hematemesis. The patient refused the barium study because of his clinical and hematological deterioration. Ultrasonography, spiral CT and T1 and T2 MRI were performed. results: Ultrasonography showed a large heterogeneous hypoechoic mass with having multiple acustic posterior shadowing areas within the stomach. Spiral CT scan revealed a marked dilatation of the stomach and a huge, moveable hypodense mass inside the stomach and duodenum. Precontrast and postcontrast CT scan revealed that intragastric mass had the same density in both studies. MRI confirmed the CT findings. At surgery, there was a duodenal ulcer and huge hematoma within the lumen of the stomach and duodenum that caused complete obstruction of the passage. During the operation, active bleeding was not controlled and unfortunately the patient died in a few hours. Conclusion: Although endoscopy and barium studies are still very important for the diagnosis of upper GI bleeding, CT scan may also be a useful method in determining of complications that occur due to ulcer bleeding.

Because of its rarity, there have been few reports about the imaging findings of this tumor. Imaging findings or procedure details: We retrospectively reviewed MR findings of pathologically confirmed combined HCC-CC in 11 patients (all men; mean age, 50.9 years). The tumors were divided into three groups by gross pathologic examination: HCC type (n=2), CC type (n=8), and collision type (n=1). The images and pathologic findings were retrospectively compared. All patients showed high signal on T2 weighted images. Three tumors revealed focal high signal intensity on T1 weighted image due to necrosis. The CC types demonstrated peripheral rim-like enhancement (n=8) and irregular margin (n=7) with cirrhotic feature (n=8). The HCC types were well enhanced in the arterial phase and low signal intensity in the delayed phase. Lymph node enlargement and bile duct invasion were observed in two and one patients, respectively. (n=7), choledocholithiais (n=4), pancreatitis (n=2), diverticulitis (n=1), cholecystitis (n=1), hepatitis (n=1), inflammatory bowel disease (n=1), APN (n=1), phlebitis (n=1), postoperative state (n=1)), 13 malignancy (gastrointestinal (n=9), hepatobiliary (n=2), and gynecological (n=2)), and 8 other diseases. HCE pattern of focal or diffuse was not significantly different between inflammation and malignancy (p=0.246). Conclusion: HCE is not a unique finding in FHCS, and it could be presented in broad disease spectra of inflammation, malignancy, and the other diseases in the abdomen and pelvis. HCE may be one of the important findings that represent any kinds of inflammation or malignancy in the abdomen and pelvis.",

Cimilli; Istanbul/TR purpose: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the signal intensities of hydatid cysts on diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI-MRI) and the value of DWI in the differential diagnosis of simple and hydatid cysts of the liver. material and methods: Thirty-four simple and 73 hydatid cysts were included in this study. All hydatid cysts were examined by sonography and classified according to the World Health Organization. The diagnosis of hydatid cysts was confirmed by biopsy or positive serology. DWI were acquired using the following b values: 0,500 and 1000 s/mm\u00b2. ADC maps were reconstructed from these images. On DW trace images, signal intensity of cysts were visually compared with the signal intensity of the liver using a 5 point scale. The signal intensity of the cysts, cyst to liver signal intensity ratios, ADC of the cysts and cyst walls, cyst to liver and wall to liver ADC ratios were compared between the groups quantitatively. results: All ADC values and ratios were shown to gradually decrease parallel to the maturation of cysts. In visual scoring with a b factor of 1000, the signal intensities were different between simple cysts and complete liquid type hydatid cysts (p=0.032). Background: Contrarily to the most frequently seen MRI pattern, liver nodules may show total or partial hypointensity on T2-w images. T2-w hypointensity can be absolute or relative depending on the native signal intensity of the normal parenchyma and/or sequence used. Causes for absolute hypointensity include haemorrhage, iron (native or exogenous from contrast agents), calcium, copper or melanin deposition, and also abundant fibrous or smooth muscle stroma. Relative hypointensity is seen in lesions with a fatty component. Imaging findings or procedure details: Despite rare, low signal intensity regarding the surrounding liver on T2-w images may be found in a wide spectrum of lesions. Examples shown include focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatocellular adenoma (HCA), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), metastases (including metastatic melanoma), leiomyoma, nodular regenerative hyperplasia/regenerative nodules, dysplastic nodules, siderotic nodules, nodules in Wilson's disease, granulomas and inactive hydatid cysts. Lipoma, angiomyolipoma, HCA and HCC may also display T2-w hypointensity depending on the technique used to achieve fat-suppression. Conclusion: T2-w hypointensity, although a less common presentation of focal liver lesions, has a variety of causes. Their knowledge is helpful to derive the correct diagnosis, integrated in the clinical context. In some cases, however, radiological-pathological correlation is necessary to understand the full-blown picture for the hypointense appearance.",

A wide array of several acquired and congenital disorders of the PV and its branches are presented in this educational exhibit with CT and MRI findings. Among these are acute and chronic thrombosis of the PV and cavernomatous transformation, agenesis of the PV, gas in the PV due to mesenteric ischemia, bland and tumor thrombus of the PV in the setting of HCC, invasion of the PV secondary to extrahepatic malignancies and a very rare case of agenesis of the PV in a pediatric patient with biliary agenesis. Also, imaging findings of patent ductus venosus and anomalous pulmonary venous return to PV are included. Conclusion: Prompt and precise diagnosis of PV pathology may dramatically affect the treatment work-up of the patients. Therefore, we think that the in-depth knowledge of these processes is the sine qua non of a successful practice in both abdominal and general radiology. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used in the surveillance of these patients due to exquisite soft tissue contrast capability without ionizing radiation. As more patients undergo liver tumor ablation procedures, it will become increasingly important that radiologists be able to recognize typical postablation MRI findings. In our department, more than 200 liver tumors (130 cryoablations, 99 RF ablations, and 16 alcohol injections) have been ablated, a majority of which has been followed up with MR imaging. In this presentation, we reviewed post ablation MR imaging features of liver tumors with illustrated examples. Imaging findings or procedure details: After successful ablation, liver tumors typically show no enhancement. Although a thin peripheral rim of enhancement may be seen in completely ablated tumors and may last several months, areas of nodular enhancement at the site or vicinity of an ablation zone is suggestive of residual/recurrence tumor. Conclusion: MRI is a useful modality in surveillance of liver tumor following percutaneous ablation. Subtraction is helpful to demonstrate unenhanced ablation zone and detect abnormal enhancement.",

Background: The study of hepatic arteries results is extremely important in several pathological conditions, in particular in pre-surgical planning for patients undergoing hepatic surgery or in patients undergoing selective chemotherapic infusion. Multi-detector-row CT angiography (MDCTA) can produce excellent image quality and detail of hepatic arteries by correctly identifying anatomical variants. Imaging findings or procedure details: In this educational exhibition, we describe MDCTA technical parameters for the study of hepatic arteries. We present also examples both of normal hepatic arteries and hepatic variants by using axial images and reconstruction methods (MIP, MPR and VR). We present and discuss some relevant cases in order to underline benefits and pitfalls of MDCTA. Accurate delineation of the tumor extent poses a great challenge to modern imaging methods and MDCT as a single modality has the potential to comprehensively evaluate each patient for all the criteria of unresectability. It also has the potential of obviating the need for preoperative angiography in most cases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) along with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is ideally suited to evaluate the bile ducts and also identifies intrahepatic mass lesions.

MDCT examinations using 100 ml of 300 mg I/ml at a flow rate of 4.0 ml/sec (1.2 g/sec) in protocol A, and 80 ml of 370 mg I/ml at a flow rate of 3.2 ml/sec (1.184 g/sec) in protocol B were performed in the same patients. After unenhanced scans, multiphasic scanning at 25, 40, 70, 180 sec was started after CM injection. Bolus tracking and saline flushing were not used. The CT values of hepatic parenchyma, abdominal aorta, and portal vein were measured. Their mean enhancement value was quantitatively analyzed. Hepatic enhancement and vascular enhancement were assessed qualitatively using a 4-point scale. results: There were no significant differences between the two groups in the mean enhancement of hepatic parenchyma, abdominal aorta, and portal vein. Quantitative assessment for the segmental branch of hepatic artery, intrahepatic portal vein, and hepatic parenchyma show no significant difference between two groups. Conclusion: We conclude that MDCT using 80 ml of 370 mg I/ml CM can decrease flow rate, while maintaining the same qualitative and quantitative performance.",

Sequential acquisition of the liver was performed before and during 2 min after intravenous injection at 4cc/sec, 0.5 mg/kg of contrast medium. Data were analyzed using deconvolution analysis to calculate blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), mean transit time (MTT), Arterial hepatic index (AHI) and bi-compartmental analysis to obtain vascular surface permeability (SP). Post treatment was performed by a radiologist and ROI were plotted on metastases, normal liver, aorta and portal vein. results: In case of necrotic metastases, none of the CT perfusion parameters was changed. Compared to normal liver, significant difference was found for all CT perfusion parameters in case of hyperdense metastases and only for AHI and MTT in case of hypodense metastases. No significant difference was found for MTT and AHI between hypo and hyperdense metastases; otherwise, we describe significant decrease of SP in hyperdense lesion and significant decrease of BV and BF in hypodense lesions.

Paired T test was used to evaluate mean percentage change of volume, RECIST and density measurements. P<0.05 was considered significant. results: The mean RECIST measurement increased from 28.7 to 30.8 mm (11.03%, P<0.0018) while the mean volume for the same lesions increased from 13.5 to 17.0 mL (55.0%, P<0.014).

Conclusion: The use of a conversion factor (0.8 for CT and 0.75 for MR) is highly recommended if absolute weights and volumes of liver segments are demanded. included in the study. These patients were subdivided into a liver cirrhosis group (LCG) and a non-liver cirrhosis group (non-LCG). We measured the RNHFI (mean standard deviation of hepatic signal intensity (SD), noise-corrected coefficient of variation (CV)) of three ROIs in the liver parenchyma on SPIO MRI. The LNHFI (AST-platelet ratio index (APRI)) of all patients was also calculated. We compared the RNHFI and APRI of the LCG with those of the non-LCG using the Student's t-test. A bivariate correlation was performed to investigate the relationship between the RNHFI and APRI in the LCG. results: For the LCG, the mean values of SD and CV on SPIO-enhanced MRI were 10.3\u00b13.7 and 0.19\u00b10.08, respectively. For the non-LCG, the mean values of SD and CV were 6.5\u00b11.6 and 0.08\u00b10.05, respectively. The mean APRI of the LCG and the non-LCG were 2.04\u00b11.7 and 0.32\u00b10.32, respectively. The SD, CV and APRI were significantly different between the LCG and non-LCG (p<0.05). In all patients, there were significant correlations between CV and APRI (r=0.438, p<0.001), and between SD and APRI (r=0.633, p<0.001).",

The aim of this exhibit is to review the imaging and histological findings of the pathological changes that can occur in liver during pregnancy. Three categories are considered: 1) Liver dysfunction specific to pregnancy, 2) Pre-existing disorders that may be aggravated by pregnancy and 3) Liver disease coincident with pregnancy. Background: The liver is subject to changes in pregnancy, some physiological and others pathological. In some patients, this is life threatening and requires urgent management. Knowledge of these and of their imaging appearances is essential for the radiologist to ensure appropriate treatment. Imaging findings or procedure details: 1) Physiological changes in the liver in pregnancy. 2) Imaging features with histological correlation of liver diseases specific to pregnancy: -Acute fatty liver of pregnancy -Intrahepatic cholestasis -Hypertension-associated liver disease -pre-eclampsia-hepatic infarction and rupture-HELLP syndrome. 3) Pregnancy and pre-existing liver disease: -Liver tumours -Portal hypertension -Congenital hyperbilirubinemia. 4) Liver disease coincident with pregnancy: -Biliary disease -Budd-Chiari syndrome.

Lomas; Cambridge/UK purpose: Early and moderate stages of hepatic fibrosis are difficult to diagnose accurately using most imaging techniques making invasive liver biopsy necessary and serial studies difficult to undertake. Several MR techniques have recently been shown to improve on standard imaging. This work describes our initial experience with: Liver stiffness measurement using MR elastography (MRE), 31Phosphorus hepatic spectroscopy and T2w morphological imaging. material and methods: 10 consecutive patients with clinically suspected hepatic fibrosis referred for liver biopsy were recruited. Each patient underwent MR examination including: Multishot T2w RARE, MRE and 31P spectroscopy. The patients underwent a liver biopsy the same day as the MR examination. Each sequence was independently evaluated for: liver stiffness (KPa), PME/PDE ratio and morphological evidence of fibrosis. The liver biopsy was graded independently by a pathologist using the Ishak Fibrosis Score. results: A broad range (1-6) of Ishak fibrosis scores were found at histology. These correlated well (0.86 Pearson rank) with MRE stiffness values which ranged from 2.7 to 12.7 KPa. The correlation was poor (-0.15) with PME/PDE ratio which ranged from 17.9 to 46.2%. All except one examination was graded as normal morphologically on T2w imaging.",

Studniarek; Gdansk/PL purpose: The purpose of this study was the evaluation of the apparent diffusion coefficients' value (ADCs) of diffusion-weighted MRI for the assessment of liver cirrhosis. material and methods: A total of 75 patients were prospectively evaluated with diffusion-weighted MRI using 1.5 T system. T1 and T2-weighted SE, FSE sequences and echo-planar diffusion-weighted MR study with different b factor (b= 0-15; 0-30; 0-300; 0-500; 0-2000 s/mm 2 ) were performed. Region of interests (ROIs) were set on ADC map in each hepatic segment and mean ADC for the liver of each patient was calculated. The patients were divided into two groups: group A -33 patients with clinical signs of cirrhosis (Child-Pugh stage A) confirmed by liver biopsy and group B -42 patients with normal liver function. The mean ADC for cirrhotic (group A) and non-cirrhotic liver for different b factor were compared. results: The ADCs value was lower in group A than in group B, but statistical differences were observed for low b factor: b= 0-15 and 0-30 s/mm 2 (retrospectively p=0.001 and p=0.002). Conclusion: ADCs measurements for low b factor are potentially useful for the evaluation of cirrhotic liver. material and methods: 1H-MRS was performed in twelve subjects on a 3.0 T Philips scanner. Each subject underwent four 1H-MRS scans: two in fasting condition on the same day, and two one week later, before and after a high fat breakfast. From the spectra, a ratio representing hepatic fat content (mg fat per gram liver tissue) was calculated and used to compare the 1H-MRS scans to assess reproducibility (Wilcoxon signed rank test and intra class correlation coefficient). results: Mean hepatic fat content in scan one and two was 37.1 and 37.0 mg/g, for scan three and four 40.1 and 42.4 mg/g. We found no significant difference in hepatic fat content between scan 1 and 2 (p=0.62), scan 1 and 3 (p=0.20) and scan 3 and 4 (p=0.11).

All the patients were examined with a dynamic contrast-enhanced MR T1W sequence. Finally, 17 patients were included with a total of 28 FNH lesions. Lesions size in its greater diameter was measured in millimeters, at each contrast-enhanced MR examination. The percentage of variation was calculated (difference in maximal diameter normalized to the initial size). A significant variation was considered when there was a size changed greater than 15%. results: The mean time interval between the two imaging examinations for the whole group was 925 days (\u00b1521). Six out of 28 lesions (21%) showed a significant variation at its largest diameter. Four of them decreased in size while two increased, changes being modified as much as 48%. The other 22 lesions remained stable during the follow-up period. Change in size could not be related to any predisposing factor. Conclusion: FNH can vary significantly in its diameter during follow-up examination. As many as 21% of these lesions either enlarge or decrease in size. No relationship could be found between size variation and predisposing factors.",

Background: Haemochromatosis (HC) is characterised by a gradual increase in body iron, and can be hereditary or secondary. Both types cause abnormal iron deposition in multiple organs, most commonly the liver. If untreated, the subsequent cirrhosis significantly increases the risk of HCC. Current radiological evaluation is principally centred around MRI, and to a lesser degree, CT. Although often a first line investigation, limited literature exists relating to the role of US in the diagnosis of HC. B 86 DOI: 10.1007/s10406-008-0008-8 Imaging findings or procedure details: We consider 4 cases that initially presented with abnormal LFTS and were later proven to have HC. In these cases, the initial US showed multiple hyperechoic liver lesions (HLL) where the differential diagnosis included haemangiomas, focal fatty infiltration, metastases and hepatic adenomas. We will illustrate these findings with correlation to MRI and CT images where available. Histological correlation will also be illustrated with a review of the literature. Although these lesions had imaging characteristics of fat containing lesions, it is interesting that this particular pattern was noticed in the presence of underlying HC. Conclusion: Early diagnosis of HC could prevent the development of fatal complications, and although non-specific, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of multiple HLL.",

Cross-sectional imaging including CT, MRI and even US can diagnose intra-lesional fat with high accuracy. Characterization of these lesions on imaging can allow for a specific diagnosis or can help narrow the differential diagnosis.

Chung; Seoul/KR Learning objectives: To illustrate characteristic appearance and discuss differentials of hepatic tumors that can contain a large amount of fat. To emphasize on early diagnosis of well-differentiated liposarcoma of the liver. Background: Hepatic tumors that can contain large amount of fat are lipoma ,angiomyolipoma,and well-differentiated liposarcoma. Hepatic lipomas are rarer than angiomyolipomas and can occur sporadically. Hepatic angiomyolipoma is a rare benign mesenchymal tumor. Well-differentiated liposarcoma is a rare malignant tumor. Because of their rarity and similar imaging findings, we often consider masses containing large amount of fat as benign lesions. So early diagnosis of well-differentiated liposarcoma is not easy. According to the clinical course, liposarcoma of the liver has a high rate of recurrence. Generally, the prognosis is poor without treatment. The well-differentiated type is considered to have low-grade malignancy. Other types are regarded as intermediate or highly malignant tumors. It is possible to differentiate the well-differentiated liposarcoma from an angiomyolipoma or lipoma on MDCT and MR imaging. Imaging findings or procedure details: An angiomyolipoma presents with central vessels within the lesion as a characteristic feature and lipoma appears as a pure fat-containing lesion on CT and MR. Well-differentiated liposarcomas show an almost fatty, lobulated mass with a few, random distributed vascular structures and small areas of nodular enhancement.

Maroldi; Brescia/IT purpose: To assess the efficacy of contrast enhanced US (CEUS) in the characterization of hepatic lesions (<1 cm), defined too small to be characterized at MDCT, in neoplastic patients. material and methods: 33 consecutive indeterminate lesions <1 cm in 16 neoplastic patients were depicted on 16 rows MDCT. All lesions underwent B mode baseline US and CEUS. CEUS was performed with the standard dose of 2,4 ml Sonovue using real time continuous scanning during arterial, portal and late phase with specific contrast setting (contrast coherent imaging: CCI) at low MI (0.1-0.2). The gold standard was clinical follow-up of at least 6 months with adequate imaging findings (MR, US, MDCT). results: Final diagnoses were: 13 cysts, 3 hemangiomas, 2 metastasis, 4 benign lesions, not characterized, but unmodified during follow up. 11 lesions were undetected both at baseline US and CEUS. Imaging follow-up shows no lesions within the liver in these patients. 9 lesions in 4 patients were cysts, detected with B-mode US without contrast administration. In 12 patients, CEUS correctly characterized 21/24 lesions (87.5%). Overall US (B-mode and CEUS) has correctly characterized 30/33 lesions (90.1%). Learning objectives: 1. Overall view of different modalities of imaging used to diagnose and characterize FLL. 2. Define radiographic appearances of these lesions on different imaging modalities. Background: Focal liver lesions (FLL) can be benign or malignant. Commonly seen benign lesions are cysts, haemangiomas, focal nodal hyperplasia, hepatic adenomas and biliary cyst adenomas. Malignant lesions can be primary or secondary. It is important to differentiate between the two to optimize treatment and to avoid unnecessary interventions. Various radiological imaging modalities are employed for the diagnosis and characterization of FLL. The enhancement pattern of a lesion constitutes the mainstay of its characterization with contrastenhanced CT or MRI. Imaging findings or procedure details: Based on our experience, we present a spectrum of appearances of FLL seen on USS, CT scan and MRI. CT images were obtained pre and post intravenous contrast. Liver specific contrast agents and gadolinium were used for MRI scan. The characteristic appearances of the mentioned lesions are described here in a pictorial review. Conclusion: Different modalities contribute to the diagnostic assessment and have their own advantages and disadvantages. USS is highly sensitive in the diagnosis, but less specific in characterizing these lesions. However, MRI with newer liver specific contrast agents is more sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of FLL compared to multislice spiral CT.",

An accurate and non-invasive differential diagnosis using MRI is possible based on both dynamic imaging and functional information of liver-specific contrast-agents. Imaging findings or procedure details: The identification and characterization of FNH and HA requires an accurate dynamic study of the liver for the assessment of lesion vascularity. Unfortunately, a definite differential diagnosis on the basis of morphology and lesion vascularity is not always possible.

We prospectively evaluated 10 probably FNHs with dynamic MRI using Gd-EOB, using multiple time delays. material and methods: T1w, T2w and THRIVE unenhanced, arterial (20 sec), portal (50 sec), equilibrium (3 min) and delayed phase (10, 20 and 30 min after injection of Gd-EOB) were obtained. Lesion signal intensity and homogeneity were graded for each sequence and time window. Presence of a central scar and time of biliary excretion was noted. results: Nine FNHs showed typical homogeneous enhancement during arterial, portal and equilibrium phases, seven with a scar and two without a scar. One atypical FHN was iso-intense on portal phase and slightly hypo-intense in the equilibrium phase with no central scar. On delayed imaging, two FNHs were isoand slightly hypointense. Five FNHs showed marked inhomogeneity, four only during delayed enhancement, one during all time windows. No significant difference was observed between 10, 20 or 30 minutes images. Biliary excretion was seen from 10 minutes onward in nine patients. Conclusion: Using Gd-EOB, inhomogeneity is frequently encountered in FNHs on delayed imaging. A delay of 10 minutes may be sufficient for the hepatobiliary phase.",

Rajashanker; Manchester/UK Learning objectives: To identify and describe a wide spectrum of fat-containing lesions in the liver and the imaging characteristics that distinguish them. To review current MRI techniques used in characterisation of these lesions. Background: A fat-containing lesion within the liver is frequently encountered in clinical practice. The causes are diverse and can range from benign lesions to malignant neoplasm. The benign entities include hepatic steatosis, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, angiomyolipoma, lipoma, teratoma, adrenal rest tumour and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Malignant lesions include HCC, liposarcoma and metastatic liver lesions. Imaging findings or procedure details: Both US and CT can be useful to demonstrate the presence of fat. However, MRI is the most sensitive modality in the characterisation of these liver lesions. Several MRI sequences including inand-opposed phase gradient echo T1W sequence, spin echo T2W sequence, dynamic post contrast images and the use of liver specific contrast agents help to differentiate these lesions and aid in achieving an accurate diagnosis. In this pictorial review, we illustrate the radiographic features of various entities of focal and diffuse fat-containing lesions of the liver, with focus on MRI. A detailed understanding of these lesions is essential for further appropriate management. Conclusion: This presentation will help the readers to provide clinicians with the diagnosis or relevant differential diagnoses when confronted with a fat containing lesion of the liver.",

B 88 DOI: 10.1007/s10406-008-0008-8 material and methods: A total of 52 patients, ages 26 to 70 years old with NASH underwent hepatic MRI for fat quantification. The degree of hepatic steatosis was assessed by MRI through chemical shift imaging using a modification of Dixon method. The Doppler US examination of middle hepatic vein was performed in all patients. The Doppler US pattern was classified in to two groups according to Doppler signal characteristics: abnormal (monophasic and biphasic) and normal (triphasic). The degree of correlation between the Doppler signal characteristics and hepatic fat fractions was assessed using a linear regression test. results: In 23 patients (44%) with NASH, the Doppler US spectrum of the middle HVW was monophasic-biphasic. Triphasic HVWs (normal waveform) were found in 29 (56%) patients. The results of Doppler US were correlated with the hepatic fat fraction (p<0.0001).

Background: Spontaneous hepatic bleeding is a rare condition. In the absence of trauma or anticoagulant therapy, hepatic hemorrhage may be due to underlying liver disease. The most common causes of no traumatic hepatic hemorrhage are HCC and hepatocellular adenoma. Such hemorrhage can also occur in patients with other liver tumors, and other conditions. Imaging findings or procedure details: We reviewed retrospectively 29 patients with acute bleeding liver diagnosed in our institution. We present a comprehensive algorithmic approach to diagnose in acute bleeding liver. 1) Traumatic conditions (11); 2) HCC (6); 3) Hepatocellular adenoma (2); 4) Other liver neoplasms: focal nodular hyperplasia (1), hepatic hemangioma (1), hepatic metastasis (3) hepatic hamartoma (1) and primary hepatic lymphoma (1); and 5) Other conditions associated with spontaneous hepatic haemorrhage: HELLP syndrome (2), amyloidosis, peliosis, connective tissue diseases, infectious diseases, and parasitic diseases (1). Conclusion: Hemoperitoneum may occur in various emergent conditions. In the trauma setting, evidence of intraperitoneal blood depicted at CT should lead the radiologist to conduct a careful search of images for the injured visceral organ.

Tokmak; Adana/TR purpose: To present the imaging characteristics of four patients with hepatic fascioliasis (HF) showing a new finding. material and methods: Imaging and clinical findings of four patients diagnosed with HF were evaluated retrospectively. All patients were examined by abdominal US and MDCT, and two of them additionally evaluated by abdominal MRI, MRCP and ERCP. Diagnosis was confirmed by serological and parasitological tests in all patients. results: Presenting complaints were abdominal pain and fever in all patients. All patients also had eosinophilia and abnormal liver fuction tests. In all patients, US examinations showed irregular marginated hypoechoic areas, and MDCT examinations showed branching irregular linear and nodular nonenhancing hypodense areas in the liver. Apart from these findings, hyperdense materials identified in the dilated bile ducts in one patient were revealed as a new finding. MRI showed hypo (T1) and hyperintense (T2) areas of liver parenchyma in two patients, with peripheral enhancement in one of them. Filling defects and dilation of the intraextrahepatic bile ducts were identified by US and MRCP in two patients. In these two patients, fasciola flukes were removed by ERCP. Medical treatment (triclabendazole) was successful in all patients. Conclusion: HF is a rare disease that may have typical imaging findings in the liver and bile ducts.

With recent advances in diagnostic imaging techniques, the number of reports of intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunts identified incidentally in asymptomatic patients is increasing. The purpose of this study is to determine the frequency of asymptomatic intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunts on MDCT of the liver. material and methods: We retrospectively reviewed 196 dynamic CT examinations of the liver, which were performed using a 64-detector unit between April 2006 and December 2007. The study included 196 patients, aged 22-77 years (mean 52 years). All patients were administrated 120 mL of intravenous contrast material at an injection rate of 4 mL/sec. The images acquired at arterial and portal venous phases were reviewed using multiplanar reconstructions and maximum-intensity-projection. The clinical data of patients with intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunts was obtained from hospital records. results: We determined 3 patients with intrahepatic spontaneous portosystemic venous shunts. Although portosystemic venous shunts could lead to hepatic encephalopathy, all of the patients we studied were asymptomatic. One of the patients had a small shunt related to portal hypertension. The other two patients had no additional abdominal pathologies. Conclusion: MDCT can be used to identify asymptomatic small intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunts, which are probably more common than they are considered to be.",

Ribeiro; Porto/PT Learning objectives: To understand the major causes and mechanisms leading to the presence of gas in hepatic portal system and the role of US and CT studies in this setting based on imaging findings in 6 cases. Background: Presence of gas in the portal vein is a rare entity. Once detected, it should be considered a life-threatening event until proven otherwise, depending, above all, on the underlying aetiology. Intestinal necrosis is the leading cause of portal venous gas (PVG) and is associated with higher mortality rates. First reports of PVG were based on plain film findings, which have a poor sensitivity. The advent of sonography and CT allowed the detection of smaller amounts of gas in the portal system. Imaging findings or procedure details: PVG was considered present when sonography showed multiple high-amplitude echoes moving within the lumen of portal vein in the direction of blood flow. At CT, portal vein gas appears as tubular areas of decreased attenuation in the liver, predominantly in the left lobe. In the study group, US proved to be more sensitive than CT in the detection of PVG, which was reported and explained in some previous papers. Conclusion: Recognition of PVG indicates, generally, a life-threatening acute abdominal process. However, this finding is no more than a radiological clue and not a diagnosis. In our experience, sonography proved to be the most sensitive method in the detection of PVG. However, the goal of radiologic techniques, besides PVG confirmation, is to establish the underlying pathological process, which is best carried out by CT.",

The purpose of this study project is to evaluate the use of both procedures in the management of these patients referred to diagnostic accuracy. material and methods: Thirty-two patients (mean age: 62 y; 21 male) under follow-up for colorectal carcinoma with suspicion of metastatic hepatic disease have been sequentially explored in blinded conditions using CEUS and FDG-PET (mean interval: 17.2 d). Standard reference used was: lesion pathology (19/32); intraoperatory US (5/25); follow up (8/25). results: Five patients were free of tumour activity >22 months since initial treatment (true negatives). In three patients, FDG-PET showed systemic dissemination and contraindicated surgery for lesions. In twenty-four patients, CEUS and FDG-PET showed lesions as potentially resectables. Referred to individual lesions (n=68), no tests showed false positives; diagnostic accuracy for lesions was: CEUS: 58 true positive, 10 false negatives (sensitivity: 85%); FDG-PET: 37 true positives, 31 false negatives (sensitivity: 54%), mainly due to the high number of lesions smaller than 10 mm (n=17). Conclusion: Although both methods are quite useful in determining the treatment decision based on a per patient analysis, the preliminary results in this short cohort shows that CEUS helps the surgeons in their surgical attitude, obtaining much more better results than FDG-PET in order to establish the number, size and localization of liver metastasis in patients with treated colorectal carcinoma, which is determinant in surgical assessment.",

Lagalla; Palermo/IT Learning objectives: To illustrate the spectrum of CEUS findings in the assessment of RFA therapeutic response of HCC. Background: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is increasingly being used as percutaneous treatment of choice for patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An accurate assessment RFA therapeutic response is fundamental, since a complete tumor ablation significantly increases patient survival, whereas residual unablated tumor needs an additional treatment. Recently, contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has become available for RFA assessment. Advantages and limitations of CEUS are described on the basis of a series of 337 RFA treated HCC. Imaging findings or procedure details: At CEUS, a complete response is the absence of enhancing portion within or at the margin of the ablation zone during the hepatic arterial phase (HAP). Residual unablated tumor is the persistence of an irregular hypervascular area within the treated HCC in the HAP, either located within the edge (ingrowth) or around a treated nodule, and in continuity with its border (outgrowth). A uniform and thin peripheral rim of contrast enhancement surrounding the ablated zone in a rindlike fashion should be regarded as benign reactive hyperaemia, whereas a transient hyperechoic area in the HAP may be an arteriovenous shunting. Conclusion: Awareness of CEUS findings make the radiologist to confidently detect residual disease after RFA of HCC, thus allowing retreatment even in the same RFA session and resulting in a better patient management.",

To describe and explain the relevant radiological signs. To highlight the value of continuing to perform this simple quick non-invasive non-contrast inexpensive low dose examination, which may, in some cases, render CT unnecessary. Background: Because of the superior diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of MDCT and its increasing accessibility, patients presenting with an acute abdomen often proceed directly to CT without first having a plain abdominal radiograph (PFA). It is worth remembering that CT has disadvantages, specifically: radiation dose, contrast and cost. Many causes of acute abdominal pain can be ascertained by examining the PFA. Imaging findings or procedure details: Pictorial review of PFAs with CT correlation demonstrating causes of abdominal pain suggested/diagnosed from a PFA through analysis of bowel gas pattern (small/large bowel obstruction, gallstone ileus, gastric/caecal/sigmoid volvulus, congenital malrotation, hernias, intussusception, Hirschsprungs), abnormal gas shadows (aerobilia/portal venous air/intramural air), abnormally located soft tissue (masses/abcesses), abnormal bowel wall (inflammatory bowel disease, ischaemic/pseudomembraneous colitis), abnormal calcific densities (appendicolith, biliary calculi, pancreatic calcification, hepatic hydatid disease) and foreign bodies. Conclusion: Radiologists should promote awareness among clinicians of the continued value of requesting and examining the PFA and radiologists themselves should do so when accepting requests for other modalities as the diagnosis may be apparent from the PFA.",

Gayer; Zerifin/IL purpose: The purpose of this presentation is to report the CT features of splenic torsion, a rare condition which presents as an acute abdomen. material and methods: The US and CT studies of five patients with surgically proven torsion of the spleen were reviewed. All patients presented with severe abdominal pain. US was the initial study performed in all patients, followed by CT within the next 24 hours. results: US showed a mildly enlarged spleen in three patients. Diminished blood flow on Doppler examination was noted in one case. The spleen was thought to be in its usual location and the diagnosis of torsion of the spleen was not suggested. On CT, a more caudal location of the spleen in the left midabdomen was detected in four patients. Postcontrast CT showed complete lack of enhancement of the splenic parenchyma in three patients, patchy enhancement in one, and very poor, but homogeneous, enhancement in one, indicating partial or complete infarction. A \"whirl\" appearance representing the twisted splenic pedicle was seen in four patients. Emergency surgery in the five patients confirmed the diagnosis of splenic infarction caused by torsion. Four patients underwent splenectomy and the one of them underwent detorsion with splenopexy.

To outline the features of such abnormal gas shadows to facilitate recognition and accurate reporting. To demonstrate the variety of pathology that can cause such appearances. Background: Prompt recognition of abnormal gas patterns on the plain abdominal radiograph (PFA) is vital to minimise morbidity/mortality. Serious abdominal pathology such as intestinal perforation may be silent when the patient is elderly, on steroids, or unconscious/critically ill/post trauma and so the appreciation of abnormal gas patterns becomes even more important. Imaging findings or procedure details: Air on the PFA is normally confined to the lumen of the GI tract. In a variety of serious pathological conditions, air may occur within solid viscera or within the walls of a viscus (eg. emphysematous choecystitis or pyelonephritis, abscesses, necrotizing enterocolitis), it may escape into the peritoneal cavity (pneumoperitoneum), or it may occur within the biliary system (aerobilia), portal venous system, abdominal wall (abscesses, hernias) or retroperitoneum. We provide a pictorial review and discussion of possible appearances of pathological gas shadows on the PFA with reference to anatomical structures.

Keogan; Dublin/IE purpose: To review the radiological findings in patients with haematological disorders presenting with acute abdominal pain and to determine which particular pathologies and imaging features are more common or unique to this cohort of patients. material and methods: A retrospective review of all haematology patients (39) presenting with acute abdominal pain over a nine month period who underwent cross-sectional imaging with CT was performed. The clinical details, radiological findings and final diagnoses were correlated and the imaging features were reviewed. results: There were a wide variety of presentations and causes for acute abdominal pain. Some were related to tumour burden including painful organomegaly, bowel obstruction and acute urinary obstruction (11). Others were related to treatment or complications of treatment including graft versus host disease of bowel and neutropenic colitis (12). Two patients developed splenic infarction, while three patients had spontaneous retroperitoneal bleeds. Pathology unrelated to the haematological diagnosis or its treatment was demonstrated in three patients. Conclusion: Cross-sectional imaging of the acute abdomen is being performed more commonly in patients with haematological disorders. There are a wide variety of causes of abdominal pain including those directly related to disease bulk and complications of treatment. A number of pathologies are unique to, or more common, in these patients and consideration of this with knowledge of the relevant radiological findings is essential in reaching the correct diagnosis. Background: The initial goal in treatment of patients with gynaecologic malignancies, particularly ovarian cancer, is optimal cytoreduction surgery including total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, appendicectomy, total infragastric omentectomy, peritonectomy limited to the pelvis, the paracolic gutters, and infiltrated diaphragmatic areas, bowel resection limited to the rectosigmoid, if necessary, and removal of bulky lymph nodes to the infrarenal para-aortic level. Morbidity and several complications are possible in the acute phase post surgery. Imaging findings or procedure details: CT imaging is accurate for evaluating the complications in acute phase post major gynaecologic surgery as fistulas (genito-urinary, uro-enteric, entero-cutaneous); vascular complications (retroperitoneal hematoma, hemoperitoneum, renal infarction); dehiscence (anastomotic, cutaneous); and gastro-enteric complications (gastroparesis, intestinal infarction, perforation, occlusion). Conclusion: Major gynaecological surgery (MGS) is nowadays more commonly performed, especially in oncologic disease, as far as surgical and chemioradiation treatments are improving the patients' survival. Abdominal complications after MGS are not uncommon and may be more severe if not promptly diagnosed. CT, if correctly performed, may be useful for diagnosis, grading and follow-up of such complications. Knowledge of the CT appearance of these complications strongly helps in a timely and correct diagnosis.",

Kotzampassakis, T. Prot, C. Vallet, S. Schmidt, A. Denys; Lausanne/CH purpose: Emergency room reading performances have been a point of interest in recent studies comparing radiologists to other physician groups. Our objective was to evaluate the reading performances of radiologists and surgeons in an emergency room setting of non-traumatic abdominal CTs. material and methods: Ten readers representing four groups participated in this study: three senior radiologists and visceral surgeons, and two junior radiologists and surgeons. Each observer blindly evaluated 150 multi-slice acute abdominal CTs. The chosen cases represented established proportions of acute abdominal pathologies in a Level-I trauma center. For statistics, each answer was then transformed into a score ranging from 0=all false to 3=all correct. The gold standard was the intraoperative result or the clinical follow-up for non-operated patients. results: Senior radiologists had a mean score of 2.38\u00b11.14, junior radiologists a score of 2.34\u00b11.14, whereas senior surgeons scored 2.07\u00b11.30 and junior surgeons 1.62\u00b11.42. No significant difference was found between the two radiologist groups, but results were significantly better for senior surgeons as compared to junior surgeons and for the two radiologist groups as compared to each of the surgeon groups. Conclusion: Abdominal CT reading in an acute abdomen setting should continue to rely on an evaluation by a radiologist, whether senior or junior. Satisfying reading results can be achieved by senior visceral surgeons, but junior surgeons need more experience for a good reading performance. the main imaging and diagnostic procedure for evaluation of patients with acute vascular splancnic disease. However, in the last years the advanced technology of the CT showed to have a great potentiality in preoperative and pre-interventional evaluation of this kind of patients in Emergency. Imaging findings or procedure details: MDCT examinations considered were performed in emergency in our institution. All patients underwent multi-phase CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, using a thin collimation and slice thickness. Intravenous contrast administration was performed in all cases. Post processing imaging reconstruction and evaluation were made at a dedicated workstation. Vessel lumen opacification and features, viscera enhancement and appearance as well as the comparison with additional diagnostic, interventional and surgical procedures have been considered. Conclusion: MDCT could be considered a valuable diagnostic tool in evaluation of patients with suspected splancnic acute vascular disease. Accurate clinical diagnosis is difficult and often unreliable. Imaging, which is routinely requested, has been shown to minimise delay in surgery, reduce unnecessary admissions, and lower patient mortality. Radiologists must therefore understand the various imaging algorithms including when and how each modality is best utilised, as well as interpret the imaging correctly. This educational poster discusses relevant potential pitfalls -including choosing the incorrect investigation, technical errors resulting from contrast administration, phase and timing of imaging, and varied interpretation pitfalls such as missing subtle pathology and misinterpretation of normal findings and abnormalities. Imaging findings or procedure details: We illustrate the potential pitfalls in imaging the acute abdomen with specific examples and provide learning points for both trainees and consultants, including self assessment cases. Conclusion: Radiologists make a series of complex diagnostic decisions during the patient pathway from initial referral through to image interpretation. An awareness of how to avoid pitfalls at each stage reduces possible life threatening errors. Discuss when is appropriatre to perform MDCT and when US may replace it in post-traumatic abdomen evaluation. Background: To assess, describe and illustrate US and MDCT findings in the course of abdominal trauma studied in the Emergency Radiology Department, indicating the fundamental role of both imaging modalities and giving the radiologic/surgical correlation of each finding. Imaging findings or procedure details: MDCT represents the gold standard diagnostic method in the course of abdominal trauma. The fundamental findings illustrated are represented by free fluid in the abdomen, liver, splenial or other parenchimal partial or complete lesions, vascular damages, bone fractures and GI involvement. For each we present the correlation with the surgical detection. We furtherly discuss whether US has to be performed preliminarly and if constrat enhanced US may, in some cases, replace MDCT examination. Conclusion: During the course of abdominal trauma, patients may require an emergency surgery depending on findings that can be provided by different imaging modalities. US is extremely accurate in revealing free fluid into the abdominal cavity but is less accurate than MDCT in detecting parechimal lesions. MDCT represents a complete and fast imaging modality in the detection of findings fundamental for the patient clinical course. US may, in some cases such as minor traumas, repalce MDCT in the evalution of abdominal injuries. B 94 DOI: 10.1007/s10406-008-0008-8 the diverse diseases causing LLQ abdominal pain.

Evans; Swansea/UK purpose: The present workload, working pattern and shortage of out-of-hours staffing does not allow radiologists to report all the plain radiographs immediately. The main objective of the study was to evaluate how many radiographs have been reviewed by the referring clinical team, by a radiologist and note any serious discrepancies between those reports. material and methods: 100 consecutively admitted acute surgical patients requiring a plain radiograph were included in our study. Case notes were reviewed to see if the radiographs were reviewed by the clinician and their findings noted. This was compared with the radiologist report for any significant discrepancies. results: 60% of the films were reviewed by the referring clinicians while the radiologist reported on 73%. 14% of films were neither reported by the clinician nor the radiologist. Only 2 minor discrepancies were noted. Conclusion: The IRMER 2000 guidelines state that clinical evaluation of each medical exposure must be made and recorded by both 'the referrer' and 'the practitioner'. We hope that better documentation by clinicians and implementation of PACS will help in reaching this target. Few similar studies have shown that the discrepancy rate between the clinician's and the radiologist's report is very small. Should we restrict the reviewing of films only to those where a clinician is not confident?

To understanding of image findings of abdominal and pelvic trauma for the purpose of correctly diagnosing and suggesting a guideline for treatment. 2. To demonstrate image findings of various abdominal and pelvic trauma on CT. 3. To discuss the clinical impact according to variable image findings. Background: CT plays an important role not only for the detection of abdominal and pelvic injuries but also for their appropriate management. In order to make the best use of CT, the radiologist should be aware of the appearance of various types of abdominal and pelvic injuries and the findings that indicate surgery or that may warrant repeat CT studies for monitoring of expectant management. Imaging findings or procedure details: Bowel and mesenteric traumatic lesions include contusion, hematoma, partial or full laceration of the bowel circumference, and bowel transection. Injuries of the mesentery may affect the vascular structures and thus lead to either bleeding or vascular occlusion with subsequent necrosis and eventual perforation of the corresponding bowel structure. Traumatic lesions of solid organ include spleen, liver adrenal gland, kidney pancreas, and urinary bladder.

Seabra; Lisbon/PT Learning objectives: We report a case of Richter's hernia after laparoscopy, showing the relevance of CT in the diagnosis, along with a brief literature review. Background: Richter's hernia is a rare entity and is the protrusion and/or strangulation of only part of the circumference of the intestine's antimesenteric border through a rigid small defect of the abdominal wall. There are only a few references about Richter's hernia after laparoscopy since the first description in 1977. These hernias may rapidly pass into gangrene, yet signs of intestinal obstruction are often absent. Richter's hernia could be life-threatening if the correct diagnosis and early surgery are not performed. CT is the method of choice in the diagnosis.

            "text": "Ischemic hepatitis: an unusual presentation of celiac artery compression syndrome B. Yagci, N. Karabulut, S. Akalin, G. Onem, Y. Kiroglu; Denizli/TR purpose: To present imaging findings of a unique case of celiac artery compression syndrome (CACS) in whom massively increased serum transaminase levels (STL) normalized rapidly after surgical division of median arcuate ligament (MAL) fibers. material and methods: A 26-year-old male patient with known chronic hepatitis-B presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, and elevated STL. Contrastenhanced abdominal multislice-CT performed during inspiration showed normal findings. However, the symptoms including \"food fear\" continued to worsen over the following days. STL increased 10-times during this period. surgical division of MAL, STL normalized rapidly and the patient experienced dramatic relief of all symptoms. Conclusion: Hypoxic (ischemic) hepatitis is defined as a massive but rapidly reversible increase in STL due to an imbalance between hepatic oxygen supply and demand. The postoperative decrease in STL suggested ischemic hepatitis due to the CACS. To our knowledge, this association in non-transplant patients has not been reported before. CACS may induce an ischemic hepatitis-like picture, particularly in cases with chronic liver disease. Because the diagnosis of CACS can be overlooked at the routine inspiratory CT, particular attention should be paid to tailor the imaging protocols to include expiratory scan sets. In this exhibit, we will describe the concept of expandable plane (interfascial plane) in which rapidly growing fluid collections may accumulate through the review of embryology and imaging findings. Imaging findings or procedure details: CT observations demonstrated that the rapidly accumulating fluid collections or hematoma tend to escape the retroperitoneal site of origin into laminar variably fused and potentially expandable interfascial planes. Between these planes, potential communicating spaces exist. These are represented by retromesenteric plane (anterior fusion space), retrorenal plane (posterior fusion space) and lateral conal plane. Interfascial fluid collection can spread from the abdominal retroperitoneum into the pelvis along retromesenteric plane and retrorenal plane that form the combined fascial plane at the level of the iliac fossa. Conclusion: The knowledge of embryology and anatomy of interfascial plane and their interconnection is helpful for the radiologist to determine the extent and spread pathways of the retroperitoneal diseases. B 96 DOI: 10.1007/s10406-008-0008-8 (potencial spaces) is essential for accurate evaluation of retroperitoneal disease extension, such as inflammatory or infectious conditions, tumors and traumatic lesions. Imaging findings or procedure details: Abdominal CT is the major imaging modality to approach retroperitoneal pathological processes. Pancreatitis, perirenal hematomas, duodenal perforation with pneumoretroperitoneum, colonic diseases (such as retrocecal appendicitis, infiltrating neoplasms and ischemic colitis), abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture and metastatic tumoral spread are some of the nosologic entities revisited. Conclusion: Embryologic, anatomic, clinical and imaging evidences exist that retroperitoneal fluid collections and infiltrating diseases may rapidly extend to a contiguous space or interfascial plane or even to the pelvis and mediastinum. A review of these data allows a better spread pattern understanding.",

Hadnadjev; Novi Sad/RS purpose: In Serbia, there is no regulation or survey control about the amount of radiation received by a patient in any period of time. The aim of the study is to analyse retrospectively the mean dose, length of scanning and DLP during the period of one year in patients with diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP). material and methods: 154 patients (104 male), mean age 54.4\u00b114.7, were examined on 64 MDCT scanner. The entire abdomen is examined, performing all unenhanced and enhanced scans in parenchymal phase. Data is shown in the form of volumetric \"CT dose index (CTDI)\", \"ScanLength (SL)\" and \"DLP (doselength product)\". results: The patient with AP undergoes CT examination usually more than once (1.8). Per phase, average CTDI, in total was 18.9\u00b110.7 mGy, ScanTime 10.8\u00b16.0 sec, and DLP 263.6\u00b1323.6 mGycm. No significance is noted regarding the age group. Average values per phase, during one examination, were CTDI 10.63\u00b14.204mGy, ScanTime 6.31\u00b11.5 sek, DLP 68.58\u00b134.48 mGycm. Female patients had significantly longer scanning time, and male patients had significantly higher CTDI value. DLP did not differ between sexes. Low dose protocols were not used. Conclusion: The national survey program has to be established in order to follow the effective doses from CT examination in different hospitals and to correct and unify the examination protocols with lowest average radiation dose.

Camenzuli; Liverpool/UK Learning objectives: To familiarize the radiologist with subtle review areas and pathologies within the GI system as imaged on CTPA examinations. To argue the case for reduced reliance on protocol based investigations and to suggest the need for thorough clinical evaluation prior to imaging. Background: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiograms (CTPAs) have become the main stay of investigation of suspected pulmonary thromboembolism. The classical symptoms of pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath are notoriously non-specific in clinical practice. Radiologists are aware of the low positive predictive value of the D-dimer assay. Historically, it is well recognized that GI disease can mimic pulmonary pathology both symptomatically and biochemically. The increasing availability of imaging and D-dimers has arguably led to reduced reliance on clinical examination. This has lowered the threshold for performing CTPAs with positive findings often only identified in the GI system. Imaging findings or procedure details: We present in pictorial fashion, a selection of CTPA studies in which the cause of the symptoms and biochemical abnormalities are shown to be due to GI pathologies. We provide selected images of infective, inflammatory and neoplastic processes with reference to salient clinical and anatomical considerations. Conclusion: CTPAs are frequently carried out for GI pathologies. This in retrospect could have been suspected clinically, thus negating the need for an imaging modality involving significant ionizing radiation to the chest.",

With high recurrence rates (30%), accurate staging of these tumours is essential to prevent recurrences. MRI scan is proven to be effective; however, it is important to understand its limitations. material and methods: 40 consecutive patients with rectal cancer were included in this retrospective study. All images were reported by two radiologists imaging and all specimens were reported by two histopathologists. MRI staging done preoperatively was compared to post surgery histology staging. results: There were 25 males and 15 females with a median age of 70.5 years. Overall agreement in staging (TNM) between the two was 30% (n=12). T stage agreement was assessed by Kappa coefficient (k=0.4583). Sensitivity and specificity for T staging was 0.89 (0.74, 0.96) and 0.67 (13, 0.98), respectively. PPV and NPV for T staging was 0.85 (0.69, 0.94) and 0.15 (0.06, 0.30), respectively. CRM status was accurately staged, except in one patient (94.1%). Accuracy for lymph node staging was 47.5%. Conclusion: MRI proved very sensitive in identifying the CRM which remains the main factor affecting the outcome of surgery. Differentiating T2 from early T3 still remains a problem as is with T1 and T2 tumours. Identification of involved nodes is also difficult unless they show similar signal characteristics as the tumour. The use of 'paramagnetic iron oxide' MR may be helpful in future.",

Al-Kindi; Muscat/OM Learning objectives: The spectrum of MRI morphology of the spleen in Sickle cell disease (SCD) reflecting the pathophysiology of splenic sequestration, infarction and 'autosplenectomy'. Background: Contrary to popular belief, the spleen in SCD does not just 'disappear' (or autosplenectomise). It has varied appearances which may be mistaken for serious pathology and result in unnecessary surgery or splenectomy. Imaging findings or procedure details: Retrospective analysis of MRI of the abdomen performed in 69 patients of SCD referred for evaluation of bone pains as part of an ongoing project to study the temporal progression of changes in spleens of patients of SCD. Six of these patients had had prior splenectomy. In the remaining 63 patients (age mean\u00b1SD 23.3\u00b17.7), a splenic volume of eight to 1546 ml (mean\u00b1SD 341.1\u00b1291.5) was recorded. The spectrum of splenic morphological appearances ranged from (in increasing order of severity of involvement): a) simple splenomegaly; b) splenomegaly with peripheral nodular or triangular areas of sequestration/infarction leading to small contracted ferrocalcific spleens; c) enlarged hypointense spleens secondary to transfusional iron overload without/with focal nodular areas of (regenerative) functional splenic parenchyma; d) normal sized markedly hypointense spleens reflecting large volume sequestration; and e) small ferrocalcific spleens. Conclusion: Splenic morphology in SCD is varied and reflects the pathophysiology of SCD. Awareness of the patterns seen and correct interpretation of morphology can help in preventing unnecessary splenectomy.",

To help develop an imaging algorithm in making a specific diagnosis with clinical and pathologic correlation. Background: Primary presacral masses may arise from rectum, ovaries, pelvic soft-tissues, or retroperitoneum, and patients with pelvic carcinoma can develop presacral metastasis or recurrence. The differential diagnosis for presacral masses is extensive. The diagnosis can be suggested depending on lesion features and relationship with adjacent organs. We reviewed CT and MRI findings of presacral masses in patients examined at our institution from January 2003 to November 2007 with correlation of symptoms and pathology. Imaging findings or procedure details: Clues of differential diagnosis include special components (fat, calcification, mucus, hemorrhage, necrosis, etc.), contour, pattern of enhancement, and relationship with rectum or sacrum. We present and discuss the imaging features of various presacral masses, which originate from rectum (stromal tumor, adenocarcinoma), ovaries (teratoma, cystadenoma), pelvic primary masses (neural tumor, liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, lymphoma, perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasm), metastatic or recurrent tumours, and non-neoplastic lesions such as endometrial cyst and abscess. Conclusion: A wide variety of lesions occur in the presacral space. The knowledge of imaging characteristics and clinicopathologic behavior of these lesions allows the diagnosis and may suggest an adequate treatment. To exhibit the implementation of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with the use of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements in the study of variable (histologically proven) abdominal lesions. material and methods: Single-shot echo-planar DWI was added to the routine abdomen MR examination in 61 patients with abdominal lesions. Quantitative analysis of ADC was made by region of interest measurements in normal and pathologic tissue of different abdominal organs (liver 24, pancreas 2, kidney 4, adrenal 7, bowel 8, ovaries 3, bladder 1, peritoneum 3 patients). results: The mean ADC of malignant lesions was in all occasions lower than that of benign lesions. The mean ADC value of liver was 1.31 (x 10-3 mm 2 sec-1), of the spleen 1.23, of the kidneys 2.25, of the adrenals 1.85 and of the pancreas 1.71. Liver ADCs showed no significant difference from 6 hepatocellular carcinomas or 11 metastatic lesions (1.64). ADC in 6 patients with colon tumor recurrences 1.13, one pancreatic cancer 1.45, one adrenal metastasis 1.32 (no significant difference from 5 adenomas -1.31). Conclusion: ADC calculation of abdominal organs and lesions can give further information and may be used as a tool (in adjunction to the other available sequences and techniques) in successful characterization of malignant lesions. Further accumulative experience is needed to define the ranges of pathologic in each occasion.",

The purpose of this study is to discuss the congenital and acquired abnormalities of the spleen and present their CT appearance. The examination technique and contrast protocol are also part of this presentation. Background: The medical records of 91 patients (55 men, 36 women, age range 18-76, mean age 56.4 years) with intrasplenic lesions were retrospectively reviewed. Location, enhancement patterns, presence of calcifications or cystic components was in all cases evaluated. Imaging findings or procedure details: The clinical history of the patients must always be taken into consideration since the imaging findings of different entities may be overlapping. The abnormalities encountered and described in this study include congenital variations, traumatic and infectious lesions, vascular abnormalities, benign and malignant neoplasms, whereas the cases presented demonstrate both the value and the limitations of the method. To determine whether MRI can measure adrenal gland volume (AGV) in normal human volunteers and to determine the intra and inter-observer variations and repeatability. material and methods: This was a simple single cohort, sequential design, 2 part study involving 4 MRI examinations per subject. Part 1: subjects underwent a single MRI examination to determine feasibility for the technique. Part 2: the volunteers were examined twice in one day (1 hour apart) and again one week later. Information was collected on four healthy subjects (three male and one female). Two different investigators estimated the area of the adrenal gland for each of the 3 mm contiguous slices on two separate occasions. The volume of the adrenal gland (in cm3) was calculated. To estimate inter and intra reader variability, a repeated-measures mixed model was fitted with adrenal volume as the dependent variable. In order to estimate any bias between readers, Bland-Altman methodology was applied. results: Total volume variation from all sources is approximately 14% of a 3 cm 3 adrenal gland. Variation over time is small (5% of a 3 cm 3 adrenal gland). Variation due to within and between investigator is larger (9% of a 3 cm 3 adrenal gland).

Actinomycosis of omentum shows bulky infiltrative solid mass with dense enhancement and multiple small abscess cavities, contiguous with the transeverse and ascending colon. Actinomycosis of urachal remnant shows infiltrative densely enhancing mass with infiltrative border with multiple small abscess cavities along urachal course. Ovarian actinomycosis reveals unilateral or bilateral adnexal mass with pure cystic or solid and cystic mass with infiltrative border. Conclusion: Abdominopelvic actinomycosis involves many organs. Awareness of its characteristic imaging findings can help in the differential diagnosis of abdominal and pelvic mass.",

These lesions are typically found in adrenal glands. However, they are rare in extra-adrenal sites and are difficult to diagnose with imaging studies. The unusual location of these tumors present an imaging studies challenge. Distinguishing these lesions from other tumors including adipose tissue and hemopoietic cells may also be difficult even at pathologic examinations. The distinction between extra-adrenal myelolipomas and malignant tumors such as liposarcomas is crucial to avoid an invasive procedure. Although sporadic case reports involving perirenal sites of myelolipomas have surfaced in the literature, only a case of bilateral extraadrenal perirenal myelolipomas with imaging findings have been reported to date.

Maceroni 2 , A. Laghi 2 ; 1 Rome/IT, 2 Latina/IT purpose: We propose a scanning protocol optimized for abdomen and pelvis evaluation using a 64MDCT scanner. material and methods: On a 64MDCT scanner, we optimized the following protocol for abdomen and pelvis evaluation: detector configuration: 64 x 0.625; 120 kv; for tube current setting a smart-mA system were used (range 100-800 mA); noise index 28; pitch 1.3. This scanning protocol was acquired before and during i.v. administration of iodinate contrast medium. Hepatic arterial phase, portal venous phase and equilibrium phase were acquired using a bouls-tracking system for hepatic arterial phase acquisition with 15 sec. of delay between aortic threshold of 100 HU. We used this scanning protocol in 150 patients referring for abdomen and pelvis CT scan. Data sets were transferred on a off-line workstation with MPR and VR capabilities. Image analysis was performed increasing the slice thickness from the native 0.4 mm up to 2.5 mm. Image analysis was performed from two radiologist in consensus and was focused to a quantitative assessment of image quality of both axial images and MPR reconstructions. results: Image quality referring to image noise of both axial and MPR reconstructions was judged optimal in all cases. The isotropic voxel properties lead to an optimal quality of the MPR reconstruction. Conclusion: The scanning protocol proposed for 64MDCT scanner in the evaluation of abdomen and pelvis enables optimal image quality and excellent spatial resolution on z-axis.",

US was performed in all patients. Inferior-venacava (IVC) angiograms were performed in B 102 DOI: 10.1007/s10406-008-0008-8 40 patients for correlation with US, including 26 endovascular interventional procedures. results: With IVC angiograms as gold standard, US was 100% sensitive for diagnosis of HVOO; and site, type and severity of IVC abnormality. US provided additional information about liver parenchyma, hepatic-veins (HV) and intrahepatic collaterals. Three distinctive types of IVC/HV disease were identified: Type I-22/100 patients-Membranous occlusion of the IVC at cavo-atrial junction by 2.1\u00b1.08 mm thin membrane; Type II-72/100 patients-Steno-occlusive narrowing -41\u00b125 mm long-of intrahepatic IVC 1 cm below cavo-atrial junction; Type III-6/100 patients -IVC was normal. All types were associated with hepatic vein abnormalities of varying severity. Types I and II showed significant differences in age at presentation 35.23\u00b18.66 v/s 25.13\u00b110.83 years (p<0.001), HV abnormalities-HV score 4.18 v/s 6.43 (p<0.001), and response to endovascular therapy, respectively. Conclusion: US is adequate for diagnosis and classification of HVOO into: Type I -Membranous, and Type II -Steno-occlusive IVC abnormalities. Percutaneous interventional procedures are most effective for Type I disease, and less so for Type II. US is helpful in the diagnosis of HVOO and rationalising patient management.",

To highlight the specific characteristics of the lymph nodes. To emphasise the importance of additional findings that may assist in the correct diagnosis. Background: Abdonimal lymphadenopathy (AL) is a very common finding during abdominal ultrasonography in pediatric patients. A clinical context explaining the cause is often difficult to define, while location, characteristics and additional findings may help to narrow the differential diagnosis. Imaging findings or procedure details: Several pathologic conditions cause AL, the most common being viral mesenteric adenitis. Of inflammatory nature are also lymph nodes accompanying appendicitis and Crohn's disease. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas of the bowel are the most common malignancy manifesting with AL while other malignancies may also spread through abdominal lymph nodes. When studying enlarged lymph nodes, it is mandatory to define their location, either intra-or retroperitoneal. Specific characteristics should be examined: their size and shape, the presence or absence and the thickness of the nodal hilum, the structural pattern of the cortex and the blood flow patterns. Ultrasonographic evalution should include all abdominal solid organs, components of the peritonal cavity, the retroperitoneum and the bowel wall looking for evidence that may contribute to the diagnosis. Conclusion: Knowledge of differential diagnosis in pediatric patients with AL, specific characteristics of the lymph nodes and additional findings may contribute significantly to the correct diagnosis.",

Taylor; London/UK purpose: To correlate endoanal USS findings with symptoms and anal manometry in women with clinical diagnosis of 3rd/4th degree obstetric-related perineal tears. material and methods: 101 consecutive women with clinically diagnosed 3rd/ 4th degree obstetric tears (and undergoing primary repair) underwent endoanal US, anorectal physiology (resting and squeeze pressures) and completed bowel function scores (Wexner incontinence scores). Comparison was made between women with radiologically confirmed 3rd/4th tears with ultrasonically intact sphincters (1st/2nd degree tear) using chi square testing and unpaired t testing as appropriate on statistical advice. results: US revealed that 32/101(32%) had no evidence of sphincter injury (i.e. 1st/2nd degree tear). Significantly, more women reported faecal incontinence (FI) in the group with actual sphincter injury (61 vs 34%, p=0.01). 14% (10/69) of those with ultrasonically confirmed tears had persisting sphincter defects despite primary repair. Anal resting pressure was not significantly different both between the 3rd/4th and 1st/2nd degree tear groups (59 vs 65 mmHg, p=0.13), but squeeze pressure was lower in those with confirmed 3rd/4th tears (57 vs 73 mmHg, p=0.003). Conclusion: One-third of patients clinically diagnosed with 3rd/4th degree tears in fact have intact sphincters on US. This group report less FI and retain a stronger anal squeeze pressure than those with ultrasonically confirmed sphincter disruption. Endoanal US has an important role in the correct management of patients even with clinically diagnosed sphincter disruption.",

Gemcitabine (G) (1000 mg/m2) was administered weekly for 7 cycles. Gefitinib (250 mg) was given orally. RESIST criteria were used to evaluate the response to treatment. In 43 patients, the volume of the primary tumor was calculated using Volumio software. results: Ten patients (19%) completed treatment while 36 (67%) progressed before the completion of the treatment. Three patients (6%) had partial response and 11 (20%) had stable disease.

Review the normal anatomy of the PDG. 2. Present imaging features and key diagnostic findings of the diseases involving the PDG. Background: The pancreatoduodenal groove (PDG) is a potential space bordered by the head of the pancreas, duodenum, and common bile duct. Diseases arising from or involving the PDG can be categorized into four types: diseases associated with the pancreas, duodenum, lymph nodes, and distal common bile duct. Imaging findings or procedure details: A didactic format will be utilized and organized based on imaging findings and clinical features. Differential diagnosis with a discussion of specific entities will follow. All patients underwent an MRI examination on a 1.5/3 T system and a CT investigation in a 64 slice scanner. Conclusion: Knowledge of the features of each disease may allow one to make a specific diagnosis, which assists in clinical management and helps to prevent unnecessary surgical intervention. Background: Accessory pancreatic duct (APD), due to hard visibility and presumed lower clinical significance than main pancreatic duct, is usually disregarded by radiologists reporting MRCP. Nevertheless, beside its role in pancreas divisum (PD), its patency lowers the risk of developing acute pancreatitis either spontaneous and after ERCP. Minor duodenal papilla (MIP) is difficult to locate radiologically, but may host diseases, like several types of endocrine tumors, and its function is crucial in PD. Imaging findings or procedure details: We reviewed 200 S-MRCP performed at our Institution from 2004 to 2007 and focused on APD with regard to: visibility, type (long, intermediate, short, ansa), morphology of distal end (stick, branch, saccular, spindle, cudgel), caliber and patency; on MIP with regard to visibility, location, size and morphology. We also assessed the APD and MIP conspicuity in various S-MRCP sequences: T2w-SSFSE, b-SSFP, 2D-MRCP w/o secretin, 3D-MRCP (with MIP, MPR), 3D-LAVA (with minIP, MPR). Conclusion: Morphological and functional evaluation of APD and MIP adds important information to those provided by S-MRCP. Newer MR sequences allow good conspicuity of these structures. Knowledge of normal and variant morphology of APD and MIP is crucial to correct image interpretation.",

Background: Groove pancreatitis is an uncommon form of chronic focal pancreatitis that affects the pancreatoduodenal groove between the pancreatic head, duodenum and common bile duct. It causes fibrous scarring of the duodenal wall, smooth stricture of the common bile duct and rarely stricture of the pancreatic duct. Its importance lies in the similarity of imaging appearances to carcinoma of the pancreatic head affecting the pancreatoduodenal groove. Imaging findings or procedure details: We describe our imaging experience of groove pancreatitis in our hepatobiliary unit. We illustrate the varied appearances of groove pancreatitis on CT, MRI and ERCP. A characteristic sheet of mass is noted in the pancreatoduodenal groove which is hypodense on CT, hypointense on T1 and iso to marginally hyperintense to the normal pancreatic parenchyma on T2 weighted images. Cystic changes within and thickening of the duodenal wall are noted. A smooth stricture of the common bile duct is present on MRCP and ERCP. Conclusion: Although certain imaging features can distinguish groove pancreatitis from pancreatic carcinoma, it remains difficult to differentiate the two conditions and histology is often required for correct diagnosis. A mass in the pancreatoduodenal groove in a patient with abdominal pain and vomiting should prompt the radiologist to consider groove pancreatitis as a differential diagnosis in order to avoid unnecessary surgical intervention.",

Yamada 2 , S. Matsumoto 2 ; 1 Yufu-shi/JP, 2 Oita/JP Learning objectives: 1. To understand the normal CT anatomy of PLN. 2. To demonstrate the multi-detector row CT (MDCT) imaging of PLN invaded by the pancreatic carcinoma.Background The peripancreatic lymphatic networks (PLN) are frequently involved with pancreatobiliary carcinoma, affecting the prognosis. However, little attention has been paid to the CT imaging of normal and pathological conditions of PLN. Imaging findings or procedure details: In this education exhibit, we will demonstrate the normal PLN obtained by imaging reconstruction every 1 mm with multiplanar reformation using MDCT. Furthermore, we will review the CT images of PLN invaded by the pancreatic carcinoma. The normal peripancreatic lymphatics were usually detected as \"linear structures\" on MDCT. On the other hand, the peripancreatic lymphatic invasion of pancreatic carcinoma was frequently identified as \"reticular\", \"tubular\" or \"soft tissue mass\" appearances in the peripancreatic fat tissues on MDCT. The peripancreatic lymphatic invasion of pancreatic carcinoma on MDCT was more frequently detected around the common hepatic artery, celiac artery, and superior mesenteric artery. Conclusion: Knowledge of the CT imaging of normal and abnormal PLN is essential for determining the accurate staging of pancreatic carcinoma.",

This ranges from establishing the diagnosis and aetiology, the merits of using imaging-based severity scores for prognosis, recognition of complications and, finally, when and how interventional procedures should be performed.Background Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an increasingly common clinical problem which is associated with a significant morbidity and mortality. The radiologist may encounter patients for a number of reasons, from diagnosis to therapy. It is vital that the radiologist and clinician understand when, why and how to image patients optimally, together with the indications and techniques of therapeutic procedures. Imaging findings or procedure details: CT is the mainstay of imaging patients with pancreatitis, with US and MRI reserved for specific indications. This review will demonstrate the findings of AP, the value of imaging-based severity scores, the complications arising and how some of these may be managed by radiological means. We also explore the roles of US, CT and MRI in establishing the underlying aetiology of the disease. Conclusion: The radiologist may play a key role in the management of patients with AP, but in order to fulfil this, one needs to be aware not only of the imaging techniques and findings, but when to initiate intervention.",

Deshpande, C. Fernandes-del Castillo, A. Fischman; Boston, MA/US purpose: Characterize mucinous pancreatic lesions on MDCT and establish features predicting malignancy. Distinguish malignant lesions, based on increased FDG uptake. Correlate areas of increased FDG activity with morphologic features on MDCT. Compare performance of MDCT, PET and PET-CT. material and methods: 28 suspected mucinous lesions in 20 patients (M:F 9:11, Age 33-84 yrs), evaluated with dual phase pancreatic 16-MDCT with abdomen FDG-PET and surgery, were included in this prospective study. One reader evaluated MDCT features and lesions were categorized into benign/malignant. Another reader analyzed FDG-PET; areas of highest FDG uptake were quantified with standard uptake value (SUV). Areas of increased uptake on PET were correlated with morphological features on MDCT on fused PET-CT images. Pathology served as gold standard. results: Pathologically, 12 lesions were main-duct IPMNs, 12 side-branch IPMNs, 1 MCN, 1 SPPN and 2 unclassified cysts. 21/28 lesions were benign and 7/28 malignant. MDCT accurately characterized lesions in 75%. MDCT features favoring malignancy were gross PD dilatation, thick wall/septae and mural nodule. Areas of increased FDG uptake correlated with thick wall/septae and mural nodule on MDCT. Sensitivity and specificity of MDCT, PET and PET-CT for malignancy were 86 and 91%, 43 and 95% and 86 and 86%, respectively. Conclusion: Dual-phase 16-MDCT reliably characterizes mucinous lesions and prediction of malignancy. Increased FDG uptake is highly specific for malignancy and can complement MDCT to increase confidence of malignancy. ",

Bartolozzi; Pisa/IT purpose: To determine the usefulness of visual assessment of high-b value diffusionweighted MRI (DW-MRI) in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic lesions. material and methods: Ten patients with malignant pancreatic lesion confirmed at surgery (ductal adenocarcinoma, n=8; metastasis, n=1, papillary mucinous carcinoma, n=1) and 15 patients who were being followed-up at our institution because of pancreatic disease other than malignancy (focal chronic pancreatitis, n=2; autoimmune pancreatitis, n=1; IPMT, n=5; serous cystoadenoma, n=5; pseudocyst, n=2) were included in our study group. All patients underwent MRI at 1.5 T device (Signa EXCITE; GE Healthcare). DW-MRI was performed using a breathhold single-shot echo-planar sequence with b gradient factor values of 300, 500, 700 and 1000 sec/mm\u00b2 in three orthogonal directions. All DW images were blindly interpreted by two reviewers in conference that graded the presence of lesions on a three-point scale on the basis of their signal intensity on high-b value, as follows: 0, absent (no signal); 1, undetermined (mild to moderate signal); 2, present (strong signal). results: The reviewers graded as \"2\" all adenocarcinomas, pancreatic metastasis and autoimmune pancreatitis (false positive), whereas papillary mucinous carcinoma was defined as undetermined (false negative). All the other pancreatic lesions show \"no signal\" on high-b value DWI. The sensitivity and specificity of high-b value DW-MRI for the detection of pancreatic malignancy were 90 and 93%, respectively. Conclusion: Visual assessment of high-b value DW-MRI might be helpful in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic lesions.",

Fox; Plymouth/UK Learning objectives: To illustrate the radiological appearance of the complications associated with colorectal stent placement and demonstrate how the varying complications can be managed.Background In patients presenting with large bowel obstruction, the morbidity and mortality of emergency surgery remains high and self-expanding metal stent insertion is commonly used as an alternative. Stenting can be performed using fluoroscopic or endoscopic guidance or a combination of both. The local complications associated with colorectal stents include rectal bleeding, perforation, stent migration, stent fracture and stent blockage due to tumour in growth. Perforation can be caused by the initial stent insertion, stricture dilatation or due to stent erosion through the colonic wall. It is important that these complications are both detected early and effectively managed in order to optimise a patient's treatment or palliation. Imaging findings or procedure details: We provide a radiological review of the complications associated with colorectal stents and outline the management options available for treating them using video demonstration of the techniques used in our department. Conclusion: It is important that radiologists are able to recognise the complications associated with colorectal stent insertion and appreciate the management options available.

May; Bradford/UK purpose: Laparoscopic insertion of gastric bands is one of several surgical techniques used to treat obesity. Following insertion of a band, radiological inflation/ deflation is necessary in order to ensure optimal function. The purpose of this study is to review our local experience of the implications for the radiology department when setting up a laparoscopic banding service. material and methods: A retrospective audit of gastric bands placed in our institution (April 2005-September 2007) was performed. 19 cases were reviewed. Costs were derived using the business case figures for our institution. results: Mean weight loss was 21.4 kg (range 2-50 kg). The average number of band adjustments was 4 (range 2-9) with a time interval between adjustments of 2-3 months. In 4 cases, urgent band volume reduction was necessary due to complete dysphagia approximately 2 days after the previous adjustment. A single patient needed emergency admission to remove the band due to position slip. The cost per adjustment was \u20ac307 with a mean total cost per patient of \u20ac1228 (\u20ac614-2763). Conclusion: Participation in a gastric banding service requires on average 4 adjustments per case at a cost of \u20ac1228 per patient. The requirement for band readjustment and emergency admissions must be factored in when setting up a laparoscopic gastric banding service. B 106 DOI: 10.1007/s10406-008-0008-8",

Alluvada; Hull/UK Learning objectives: Pleurx drain should be considered for palliation of recurrent malignant ascites in terminally ill patients.Background Malignant ascites is a common distressing symptom in cancer patients requiring repeated drainages particularly in later stages due to rapid re-accumulation. Pleurx catheters which are long term indwelling catheters have been used in malignant recurrent pleural effusions. We have used these catheters for relief from malignant ascites. Imaging findings or procedure details: Pleurx drain (Denver biomedical) is a long fenestrated silicon catheter with silicon valve mechanism and a polyester cuff. The two way valve can only open with a specific matched drainage vacuum bottle. We inserted this catheter in ten patients suffering from advanced malignancies for long term ascitic drainage, with US guidance under local anesthesia. Technical success was 100% with no immediate complication. The catheter was tunnelled under the skin and the tube taped to the abdominal wall. As ascites re-accumulates, a vacuum bottle is attached to the tube and further drainage undertaken by the patient, carer or community nurse at home. Follow up showed preference by patients, avoiding repeated interventions and hospital admissions. The catheter has good life span with low complication rate. Conclusion: Pleurx drain can be used for long term palliation of recurrent malignant ascites. It is safe with low complication rate, high technical success rate, avoids repeated hospital admissions and improves quality of life.",

Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST segment depression suggestive of coronary hypoperfusion. CT examination revealed 58x46 mm well-defined fluid collection at the posterior of the base of the heart next to the thoracic descending aorta. At CT guidance via the intercostal approach, the cavity was punctured and a 6 french locked pig-tail catheter was introduced to the cavity. After the drainage, symptoms disappeared and ECG was returned to normal. results: Esophageal by-pass surgery is performed for benign esophageal strictures, perforations and ruptures, congenital tracheal and esophageal fistulas, esophageal and gastric neoplasms. Blind loop esophageal segments which are ligated proximally and distally contain squamous and glandular epithelium causing secretion collections. They are generally asymptomatic in adults but there are some complications such as infection, ulceration, compression of nearby organs and malign transformation. In our case, the symptomatic esophageal mucocele was treated with percutaneous drainage successfully and did not occur in 6 months follow-up.

Leung; Richmond, VA/US purpose: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the definitive method to manage patients with fulminant, acute and chronic liver failure. Unfortunately, organ availability is limited in USA. A \"bridge\" is needed to keep patients alive until a cadaver or a living donor is found. About 10,000 patients are waiting for a liver. Many will die waiting. Recently, right lobe living donor transplantation (RLLDT) has become accepted and organ pool increased 10-fold. One method to keep patients with fulminant failure alive is liver cell transplantation (LCT), i.e., the hepatocytes infusion from donor livers into the recipient's liver or spleen. material and methods: LCT provides function until a liver is available, or improves function in patients too sick for OLT or RLLDT, in patients with expected 100% mortality in 24 hours. Hepatocytes (200-1000 million) are harvested, cultured, frozen and stored. When needed, cells are thawed and infused in the spleen via splenic artery, or in the liver via the portal vein. Thereafter, hepatocytes colonize in the splenic pulp or hepatic parenchyma and provide hepatic function. results: We performed LCT in >20 patients. We present our encouraging experience. This new method is a \"bridge\" until OLT and/or RLLDT can be performed. Conclusion: IR must be ready to catheterize the splenic artery or portal vein procedures required on short notice during 24/7. The future of LCT is exciting; therefore, this review. Kraus\u00e9, B. Chauffert; Dijon/FR purpose: As we previously reported that an in vitro emulsion of pirarubicin, amiodarone and lipiodol was more stable and cytotoxic than a classical doxorubicinlipiodol mixture, we designed a pilot study to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of a transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) procedure using this combination. material and methods: Forty-three patients were included and underwent TACE for unresectable HCC. CT scans were performed to assess tumor response (RECIST) and lipiodol uptake after the first session. Median follow-up lasted 30 months. Endpoints were overall and progression-free survival. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were performed. results: Mean tumor size was 9.5 cm (1-20 cm) and 30/43 were multifocal or diffuse. CLIP-score was 0 in 7/40, and 1 in 16/40. Mean number of TACE sessions was 3.5 (1-11). There were 3 treatment-related deaths. Twelve (28%) partial responses and 29 (67%) stable diseases were observed. Median overall and progression-free survivals were 29 months (95% CI 13.8-45) and 15 months (95% CI 11.5-20.8), respectively. CLIP-score \u22641 (p=0.042) and lipiodol uptake>25% (p=0.003) were independent prognostic factors for better overall survival. Conclusion: This new TACE procedure is safe, gives high overall survival and merits phase III investigation for comparison with classical treatment such as doxorubicinlipiodol TACE.",

Type II -Steno-occlusive -did not respond effectively without stent placement; repeated balloon dilatations and/or metallic stents required for maintaining patency.",

            "text": "retrospective study of proximal versus distal main splenic artery embolization P.R. Rau, N.H. Stauffer, A. Denys; Lausanne/CH purpose: Proximal splenic artery embolization (SAE) is supposed to be better tolerated as compared to standard distal or segmental embolization, nevertheless, fulfilling the same treatment objectives. A smaller post-interventional complication rate in terms of infarction and infection is advocated. The objective was to test this hypothesis in our study. epos\u2122 presentatIons B 108 DOI: 10.1007/s10406-008-0008-8 material and methods: 73 consecutive patients undergoing proximal vs. distal or segmental SAE over a time period of 5 years were included in this study. Age, sex, and clinical history leading to SAE were noted. Pre-interventional imaging was reviewed for each patient, and grade of splenic injury and degree of hemoperitoneum were noted. Finally, we checked all digitally available patient records for clinical and radiological follow-up in order to assess post-interventional complications. These were examined on a four point scale, from 0=none, to 3=important complications. results: Complications following proximal SAE (N=11, median=1.0, range=0-2, mean=0.64) did not differ significantly from distal SAE (N=62, median=1.0, range=0-3, mean=0.87), U=303.0, Z=-0.63, p=0.30, r=-0.07. Conclusion: Proximal SAE is a safe and efficacious intervention as compared to distal and segmental SAE. Concerning possible post-interventional complications, there is a slight but non-significant tendency in favour of proximal SAE. There is no elevation of the secondary splenectomy rate in the proximal SAE-group. These results allow us to pursue a prospective study which might reveal a significant advantage in favour of proximal SAE.",

Akinci; Ankara/TR purpose: To demonstrate radiological features and evaluate the results of the percutaneous treatment of the hydatid cyst (HC) of the adrenal gland for the first time in the literature. material and methods: Two patients with two HCs of the adrenal gland underwent percutaneous treatment. The first patient was a 72-year old man in which radiological studies disclosed an 8x11x13 cm cystic mass with structures resembling germinative membrane in the left suprarenal region. The second patient was 43-year old female with a 4.5x3.5x3.0 cm cystic mass. The CE 3A HC was considered in the first patient and CE 2 in the second patient according to WHO classification. The interventions were performed under sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance. Among the percutaneous techniques, \"catheterization technique with hypertonic saline and alcohol\" were chosen for the management. results: No procedure related complications were encountered in the patients. Hospital stay was one day for each patient. A substantial decrease (more than 90%) in the size of the cysts was observed in both patients. No sign of viability was observed during the 45 months for the first and 26 months for the second patient. Conclusion: Percutaneous treatment of adrenal HC is a safe and effective procedure and should be considered as a serious alternative to surgery.",

Ertekin; Konya/TR purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of partial splenic arter embolization in patients with splenomegaly and with or without hypersplenism. material and methods: Thirty-four patients (18 men,14 women, mean age 48, range 34-80) with splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia underwent selective transcatheter splenic arter branches embolization with PVA, microspheres, gelfoam particles and mechanical fibrinated coils. They were not suitable for the surgical splenectomy. Eight of them were refused surgery and for the remaining 24 patients the surgeons had suggested radiological interventional procedures. Transcatheter embolization was applied to the main and distal branches of the splenic artery. In every case, 1 or 2 main branches of the splenic artery were not embolized, since we believe that noninfracted spleen segments may continue to provide immunologic functions. During embolization, super selective catheterization was supplied by micro catheters for the protection of the non-splenic vascular beds. results: After splenic embolization, platet counts had increased in all patients. Fiftynine days after embolization, the portion of infracted spleen tissue was calculated between 40-65% according to CT images. 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months after the procedure, CT and US examinations were performed. There was a significant decrease in the dimensions of the spleens. Our patients required post-procedural analgesics for an average of 2-11 days. No major complication was seen. Conclusion: Selective and partial embolization of splenic arterial branches will provide easy, safe and rapid splenic vascular occlusion as an effective alternative therapy to surgical splenectomy.",

The aims of this study were the analysis of the MDCT criteria of patients qualifying for endoscopic drainage of pancreatic fluid collection (PFC) and the evaluation of the therapeutic effect. material and methods: 40 patients in the period from 6-8weeks after acute phase of pancreatitis with PFC underwent MDCT. The indications for sterile pancreatic necrosis drainage were: a difficult to relieve abdominal pain, symptoms of delayed stomach emptying, anorexia and body weight loss. Transmural, less frequently percutaneous with simultaneous transpapillary aggressive drainage was applied in all patients. In 35 of patients, multiple drainages (2-5) were positioned and left in place for a period for 7-90 days. MDTC was performed in all patients before and after endoscopic drainage. Topography of PFC, size, number and location of the collections were analyzed. results: The size of detected PFC was 45-115 mm (mean 65 mm), the number was 1-3 (mean 1.8). The best position of the drainages location was determined on the strength of the MDCT. The appropriate criterions of evaluation affected that resolution of fluid collections was achieved in all selected lesions. Recurrence occurred in 6 patients, and four of them underwent repetition of the procedure. Conclusion: MDCT is a useful method for patient selected, therapy planning and monitoring drainage of organized pancreatic necrosis resulted in good therapeutic outcomes. ",

This sequence was repeated over a period of 75 sec with an acquisition-time of 5 sec starting together with contrast-agent injection of 25 \u00b5mol Gd-EOB-DTPA (Primovist\u00ae)/kg body-weight or 100 \u00b5mol Gd-DTPA (Magnevist\u00ae)/kg, both Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Germany at a flowrate of each 1 cc/sec and 2 cc/sec, flushed with 10 cc saline. Signal-intensities (SI) were measured in the liver-vasculature and the SI increase from baseline was calculated. results: Mean peak SI for 1 cc/sec respective 2 cc/sec in the aorta was 787.7 respective 701.4 (p=0.04) for Gd-EOB-DTPA and 849.7 respective 747.8 (p=0.11) for Gd-DTPA. Mean peak SI in the portal-vein was 382.6 respective 344.5 (p=0.36) for Gd-EOB-DTPA and 534.6 respective 542.6 (p=0.89) for Gd-DTPA. The shape of the enhancement curves in each individual pig for aorta and portalvein were similar. Conclusion: A decreased injection speed of 1 cc/sec significantly increases arterial peak-enhancement in EOB-enhanced dynamic liver MRI, whereas peakenhancement in the portal-vein is not changed significantly. With regard to arterial enhancement, this injection regimen compensates for the lower dosage of 25 \u00b5mol Gd-EOB-DTPA/kg compared to a standard Gd-DTPA-protocol.SS 12.06 sinusoidal obstructive syndrome diagnosed with superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced mrI in patients with colorectal metastases treated with chemotherapy J.

Evaluation was done according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging classification. The MR images were evaluated by two radiologists while the PET/CT images were read by one radiologist and one nuclear physician. Histology and a mean clinical-radiological follow-up of 6-9 months served as the standards of reference. results: The mean follow-up time was 186 days. Regional lymph node involvement was correctly determined in 15/20 cases as N-positive for WB-MRI (75%, p<0.05) and in 18/20 (90% p<0.05) for PET/CT exam while overall M stage was diagnosed correctly in 17/20 (85%) patients for WBMR in comparison with 18/20 (90%) in PET/CT (p<0.05). N-stage was overstaged with WBMR in 2 patients (10%) and with PET/CT in no patients and understaged in 3 patients with WBMR and in no patients with PET-CT. Distant metastases were overstaged with PET/CT in 1 and understaged in 1 patients with WBMR in 1 and 4 patients, respectively. Conclusion: WBMR is an effective and fast method for examining colon cancer patients but cannot reach the accuracy of PET-TC.SS 13.06accuracy of UspIo-enhanced mrI for local staging of rectal cancer: a multicenter study in expert and 3 regional centers M.Lahaye 1 , G.L.

The aim of this study is to compare the magnetic resonance colonography (MRC) with conventional colonoscopy for the detection of the colorectal pathologies. material and methods: 368 patients were included in this study undergoing MRC followed by conventional colonoscopy. After rectal filling with rectal enema, 3D T1w gradient echo sequence in coronal plane was acquired with the patient in prone position. Gadopentate dimeglumine (Multihance, Bracco) was injected intravenously in a dose of 0.2 mmol/kg at a flow rate of 3.0 ml/s. The analysis of the images was based on multiplanar reconstruction (MPR), targeted MIP projections and virtual endoscopic endoluminal views. The signal intensity (SI) of the normal bowel wall, polyps and other colon masses are measured on unenhanced and enhanced 3D GRE images. Results of the MRC were compared to the conventional colonoscopy. results: MRC revealed a total of 61 pathologies in 368 patients, with 18 polyps, 30 diverticulosis, 2 ileitis, 6 colitis, 2 pathologic wall thickness of caecum, 1 mass in the caecum, 1 stenosis of the sigmoid colon and 1 mass in the rectum. In addition to the morphologic appearance of polyps and other colonic masses, the criterion for the differentiation was increased uptake of lesions (191.14\u00b144.17%) compared to the normal bowel wall (58.7\u00b119.1%).

Background: Various abdominal CT applications like imaging of renal, adrenal, or pancreatic masses, abdominal aortic aneurysms and renal stones benefit from dual energy CT using two different tube currents in one single CT scan, thereby allowing for assessment of iodine distribution, calculation of virtual non contrast images, and characterization of materials in the scan field. Imaging findings or procedure details: Dual energy CT (DECT) is a new technique that allows differentiation of materials and tissues based on CT density values derived from two synchronous CT acquisitions at different tube potentials. With the introduction of a new dual source CT scanner, this technique can now be used routinely in abdominal imaging. Potential clinical applications include evaluation of renal masses, liver lesions, urinary calculi, small bowel, pancreas and adrenal glands. In CT angiography of abdominal aortic aneurysms, dual energy scanning can be used to remove bones from the datasets, and virtual non contrast images allow differentiation of contrast agent from calcifying thrombus in patients with endovascular stents. This review describes potential applications, practical guidelines, and limitations of DECT in the abdomen. Conclusion: DECT has various promising applications in abdominal imaging which are making a faster and more accurate diagnosis at less possible radiation exposure.P-073radiologic spectrum of GI stromal tumors: emphasis on unusual findings and pathologic correlation J.Y.

Cercueil; Dijon/FR purpose: To describe the radiologic findings observed with double-contrast MRI (DC-MRI) with SPIO and gadolinium, and to determine the role of DC-MRI in screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic patients. material and methods: We retrospectively included 160 DC-MRI scans done as second-line investigations in 119 patients with cirrhosis over a 25-month period. Two radiologists independently classified the MRI scans as strongly suggesting HCC (HCC Group), showing benign nodules (Benign nodules Group), showing no nodules (No-nodules Group) or indeterminate; they assigned a diagnostic confidence score (DCS) using a 0 to 10 scale. The reference standard was histology or results of follow-up investigations. Mean follow-up was 16.9 months (12-28 months). results: The radiologists disagreed for two scans (kappa=0.98). Of 112 scans (Benign nodulesGroup [n=32]  and No-nodules Group [n=80]), 11 were excluded (3 patients lost to follow-up and 8 who died with no known cancer) while a HCC was detected during follow-up in 8 patients, yielding a NPV of 92% (93/101) (95% confidence interval, 85-97%). The DCS was in the 4-6 range (indicating uncertainty) for only 6 (3.75%) scans. Conclusion: Liver fibrosis is clearly visible with DC-MRI. Regenerative nodules, flow-related abnormalities and nodules of confluent fibrosis as well as HCCs are also well depicted. DC-MRI is reliable and reproducible. Its high NPV suggests a role as a second-line investigation after ultrasonography, for HCC screening.P-170pregnancy and hepatic dysfunction: a pictorial review of imaging and histological findings D.

Two blinded readers reviewed CEUS images and were asked: 1) to classify each lesion as malignant or benign on a five-point scale; 2) to characterize, if possible, each lesion on the basis of established criteria and 3) if further imaging work-up was needed. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were calculated. results: CEUS correctly characterized 147/163 (90.2%) lesions, showing high values of sensibility, specificity and diagnostic accuracy either for benign, (86.5, 100 and 92.7%, respectively) and malignant lesions (94.7, 97.8 and 97.5%, respectively) making necessary further imaging work-up in 52/163 (31.9%) cases. Conclusion: CEUS improves the diagnostic capability of radiologists in the characterization of FHLs with accuracy comparable to that of MDCT and MR, reducing the need for further imaging investigations.

The most common findings in MR-D was an intussusception and rectoceles of different extent. Conclusion: To differentiate between chronic constipation and anorectal disorders or a combination of both, an MR-C transit time examination should be performed as well as an MR-D. CEUS of 42 resected DAs of the pancreas were retrospectively reviewed. The lesion enhancement at CEUS was scored as: 1=poorly vascularized (presence of avascular areas) or 2=well vascularized (absence of avascular areas). All the lesions were resected and underwent pathological examination assessing tumor differentiation as: 1=undifferenziated (poorly differentiated) or 2=differentiated (moderately and well differentiated). The results of CEUS enhancement and pathology were correlated by using Spearman's test. Survival analysis during four years was made by Kaplan-Meier method. Correlation between vascular pattern of DA at CEUS and tumor differentiation was found. Vascular pattern of enhancement of DA seems to be a prognostic indicator. Perfusion imaging of the pancreas is feasible using dynamic volume CT technology. To avoid high radiation exposures, low-dose acquisition is mandatory and does not hinder perfusion analysis. Perfusion imaging carries the potential to facilitate differentiation of cancerous and normal pancreatic tissue.64-row mdCt versus gadobenate-enhanced 3.0 t mrI for detection and classification of pancreatic tumorsC.

All 28/28 adenocarcinomas were shown by MRI whereas CT failed to show two adenocarcinomas (n.s.). One inflammatory mass was depicted with MRI only, and another mass was incorrectly identified with MRI (false-positive). One gastric cancer metastasis was only detected with CT. One focal steastosis was incorrectly classified with CT. Accuracy for lesion classification was 90% with CT and 93% with MRI. Accuracy for neoplastic vessel infiltration was 95% for CT and 98% for MRI (n.s.). stage and development of tumor markers were evaluated. Two radiologist analyzed CT data independently. Local recurrence, lymph node recurrence and organ metastasis have been distinguished by previously established criteria's. Surgery and progression of findings on follow-up CT exams were considered as gold standard. results: Follow-up CT exams demonstrated tumor recurrence in 42 patients. The mean follow-up interval was 3.7\u00b11.9 months, the mean relapse free time period 12\u00b16.2 months. In 25 patients with a local recurrence, 11 patients showed recurrence along the superior mesenteric artery and 10 patients laterally the celiac trunk. In 12 patients with lymph node recurrence, 7 patients showed recurrence left laterally the aorta and 5 in the mesenteric root. Surgery confirmed these findings in 12 patients and follow-up CT in 30 patients, tumor markers increased simultaneously by a mean factor of 5.8\u00b19.2 in 72% of the cases. Conclusion: Our experience so far shows that specific changes of recurrence are found especially in the run of the peripancreatic cardinal vessels indicating a pattern of recurrence for local relapse and lymph node recurrence.prospective evaluation of cystic pancreatic lesions: mdCt with pathological correlation D.

Pontillo Contillo, D. Campani, U. Boggi, C. Bartolozzi;Pisa/IT At CT, two different post-contrastograpic patterns were identified: pattern A-lesions with early enhancement (arterial/pancreatic phase) and early wash-out (compared to pancreatic parenchyma); pattern B-lesions with early wash-in and absent/ slow wash-out (B1) and lesions with enhancement only in venous phase (delay wash-in) (B2). For each lesion, the greatest diameter was also considered. CT results were compared with pathological results after surgery. results: Histopathology classified 23 as benign lesions, 18 as malignant and 8 borderline. Mean pre-secretin and maximum post-secretin ADC values were higher in normal than mild or severe chronic pancreatitis patients, but did not differ significantly between the chronic pancreatitis patients. The percent increase in ADC post-secretin and the time to peak ADC did not differ among the three groups.

Patients were scanned 65 sec after initiating the 2nd bolus. 64-row MDCT was used with 0.625 mm collimation acquisition, reconstructed at 5 mm axial, coronal and sagittal consecutive image display. Two radiologists reviewed the studies, graded parenchymal and vascular enhancement by consensus on a 5-point scale (1=none to 5=excellent) and measured attenuation in liver and spleen parenchyma, renal pelvis, aorta and porta to objectively assess contrast enhancement. mean liver and spleen attenuation: 116 HU and 130 HU, respectively).

The US and CT images were prospectively and independently reported by two different radiologists for acute appendicitis and an alternative diagnosis. Data from US and CT were compared, and the definite diagnosis was established by surgical findings (n=21) or results of clinical follow-up (n=33) as the reference standard. results: Twenty-one patients underwent surgery and had definite appendicitis. The sensitivity of CT and sonography was 91 vs. 91%, respectively; the specificity Eliminating the potential risks of contrast media and reducing hazards of radiation, low-dose unenhanced CT using 50 mAs is feasible for the evaluation of suspected appendicitis producing comparable diagnostic performance with US. clinical diagnosis. US in all patients gave a 35% missed rate, whereas this was 6% for CT with less false positives than clinical assessment only. Conclusion: The accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of AD is moderate and is not significantly improved by a clinical prediction model. Therefore, CT imaging is warranted when AD is considered as a clinical diagnosis. MDTC and MR presented high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis and stadiation of complications. MR presented better results than MDCT in the identification of causes of jaundice in presence of biliary dilatation. Conclusion: If US shows complication signs, a II level exam is mandatory to indicate the correct therapeutic approach. This role is generally assessed by MDCT, but in case of biliary dilatation MR is recommended.purpose: Head-to-head comparison of ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) in non-selected patients with acute abdominal pain (AP) presenting to the emergency department (ED). material and methods: Prospective evaluation of US and CT in all patients with acute AP >2 hours and <5 days at the ED.

Stavolo, P. Lombardo, N. Gagliardi, L. Romano;   Naples/IT purpose: Rivers of ink have been used to magnify the role of the MDCT in detecting the exact point of obstruction using multiplanar reformatting processing. However, poor interest appears to have had the evaluation of degree of the intestinal occlusion in order to answer the frequent question of the surgeons in emergency about the need to submit the patient to immediate intervention. In our study, we report the role of the MDCT in patients with small bowel obstruction (SBO) regarding the evaluation of the cause and various stages of disease. Common and uncommon causes of SBO have been observed in our patient population. Appearance of the intestine was correlated to the definitive diagnosis. Complications with segmental infarction were mostly observed in patients with intestinal obstruction caused by volvolus.Conclusion: MDCT examination could be considered of critical clinical usefulness in the assessment of the intestinal obstruction spectrum of findings in developing criteria for diagnosis and prognosis and to plan an effective surgical therapy. role of 64-slice Ct multiplanar reconstructions in acute mechanical bowel obstruction M. Galia, G. Lo Re, L. La Grutta, G. Brancatelli, T.V. Bartolotta, M. Midiri, R. Lagalla; Palermo/IT purpose: To illustrate the role of 64-slice CT in the diagnostic work-up of mechanical acute bowel obstruction. To highlight the advantages of isotropic multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) in the diagnosis of bowel obstruction.purpose: CT of the abdomen and pelvis has become standard practice for patients with suspected large bowel obstruction despite a lack of evidence to support this approach. material and methods: We interrogated the radiology database at our institution to identify patients referred for CT with a clinical history of obstruction and dilated large bowel on a prior abdominal radiograph. The CT studies of these 48 patients were reviewed by a single radiologist to determine whether there was evidence of large bowel obstruction and, if so, the aetiology. The results were compared with the final diagnosis in the clinical records and histology database. results: Large bowel obstruction was diagnosed at CT in 12/48 patients, with no false positive results. In a single patient, there was a discrepancy between CT and surgical findings. On further review, incomplete obstruction was probably present as air was seen in a distended rectum. The correct aetiology was determined in 9/12 cases. In all 3 incorrect cases, we were unable to differentiate diverticulitis from colonic carcinoma. These results yield a sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 100% and accuracy of 75% in the detection and characterisation of large bowel obstruction. Conclusion: CT has a high sensitivity and specificity in determining both the presence and site of large bowel obstruction. Distinguishing between diverticular and malignant strictures is problematic. Laparotomy was performed in 42 cases for mesenteric ischemia or other causes of acute abdomen. The remaining 58 cases were followed conservatively. Among 42 surgical cases, mesenteric ischemia was confirmed in 20 cases. Among 21 cases diagnosed with mesenteric ischemia by the use of MSCT, 12 (57.1%) had emboli in SMA, 2 (9.5%) had thrombus in SMV, 1 (4.7%) had stenosis due to thrombosis, 1 (4.7%) had emboli in SMA and thrombus in SMV. The remaining 5 patients (23.8%) had patent SMA and SMV, which were diagnosed with the accessory CT findings for mesenteric ischemia. Conclusion: MSCT with CT angiography is an effective imaging method for the diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia.",

Roy-Choudhury, D.Harji, S. Gan, B. Miller, A. Pallan,  M. Richardson, H. Kumar, T. Ngatchu;  Birmingham/UK purpose: To assess the accuracy of CT Cholangiography (CTC) in the detection of choledocholithiasis. material and methods: CTC post 100 ml biliscopin was performed on 96 patients. Images were obtained on 4 or16 slice CT (Toshiba Medical Systems, Europe) and read with MPR and MIP reconstructions. Images were compared with ERCP, intraoperative findings or a clinical follow up of at least 6 months. results: 94/95 studies were adequate and 3 studies were repeated. 30/94 (31%) filling defects were noted of which 3 were artefacts. Of the 27 perceived stones, 14 were seen on ERCP, 1 on intraoperative cholangiography (IOC), 2 were treated conservatively being less than 3 mm, 3 were lost to follow up and 7 had no stones on ERCP or IOC. In 64/94 (68%) of patients, no CBD filling defects were visualised. 2/64 did and 62/64 did not have stones demonstrated either at ERCP, IOC, other non invasive biliary imaging or on clinical follow up. One stricture was shown on ERCP. There were no hospital readmissions related to biliary colic in the 2 year follow up in this group. Anatomical biliary abnormalities were noted in 10/38 cases (where reported). Sensitivity and specificity of CTC for choledocholithiasis were 97 and 61%, although the latter is likely to be due to stone passage between CTC and clinical studies. Conclusion: CTC is a sensitive modality of in the detection of choledocholithiasis.diagnostic performance of high-resolution isotropic 3d mrCp for suspected biliary pathology K. Nandalur 1 , H.K. Hussain 2 , W.J. Weadock 2 , E.J. Wamsteker 2 , A.S. Khan 2 , T.D. Johnson 2 , T.L. Chenevert 2 ;Charlottesville, VA/US, 2 Ann Arbor, MI/US purpose: To retrospectively assess the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), using a high resolution isotropic three-dimensional fast-recovery fast spin-echo (3-D FRFSE) sequence with parallel imaging, for the evaluation of suspected biliary pathology. material and methods: One-hundred and nine patients (mean age 52 years, range 15-91 years; 65 female, 44 male) underwent MRCP using the respiratory triggered isotropic 3-D FRFSE sequence and direct visualization (98 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), 11 percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC)) between March 2003 and June 2007. Two independent readers evaluated the MRCP images for strictures, dilatation, sclerosing cholangitis (multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic strictures), and intraductal filling defects. Sensitivity and specificity of each reader were determined. results: Prevalence of disease by ERCP/PTC was 39% (42/109) for strictures, 54% (59/109) for dilatation, 21% (23/109) for sclerosing cholangitis, and 23% (25/109) for choledocholithiasis. For reader 1, sensitivity and specificifity for strictures were 93 and 94%, respectively, dilatation 98 and 98%, sclerosing MRCP using the respiratory triggered isotropic 3-D FRFSE sequence with parallel imaging demonstrates excellent diagnostic capabilities for suspected biliary pathology, although is limited for choledocholithiasis \u22643 mm. diagnostic performance of mrI for the assessment of tumor involvement of biliary and vascular structures in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma C.S. Reiner, S. Breitenstein, M.L. de Oliveira, P. Clavien, B. Marincek, D. Weishaupt; Zurich/CH purpose: To assess the diagnostic performance of MR-imaging (MRI) for determining the extent of biliary and vascular involvement in hilar cholangiocarcinomas (HCAC). material and methods: Unenhanced and contrast-enhanced MRI, (including MR-cholangiography (MRC)) was performed in 25 patients with pathologically proven HCAC using a 1.5 T-scanner. Images were analyzed by two readers independently with regard to visibility of bile ducts and vessels as well as to location and extent of biliary and vascular tumor involvement. MRI findings were correlated with a standard of reference consisting of intraoperative or imaging findings of other modalities. results: The readers rated the visibility of bile ducts and vessels as good or excellent in 83-92% of all structures. Overall sensitivity and specificity for tumor involvement of biliary and vascular structures for reader 1 (R1) and reader 2 (R2) were as follows: bile ducts, 85/88% (R1), 93/85% (R2); hepatic arteries, 79/93%, 79/95%; portal veins, 92/100%, 92/97%, and hepatic veins, 100/100%, 100/99%. In 83/67% (R1/R2) of patients with discrepancy of biliary tumor extension according the Bismuth-Corlette classification, incorrect assessment was due to artifacts caused by biliary stents or drains. In 43/50% (R1/R2) of incorrect arterial tumor involvement, incorrect results occurred for the same reason. Conclusion: Dynamic MRI including MRC is useful as a sole preoperative (\"allin-one\") imaging modality for local staging of HCAC. The assessment is limited when biliary stents or drains are present.Bilio-enteric anastomoses: evaluation with mn-dpdpenhanced mr cholangiography F. Donati, P. Boraschi, R. Gigoni, S. Salemi, L. Faggioni, F. Falaschi, C. Bartolozzi; Pisa/IT purpose: To assess the usefulness of mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced MR cholangiography (MRC) for evaluating patients with bilio-enteric anastomosis. material and methods: Twenty-six patients with bilio-enteric anastomosis underwent MRC at 1.5 T-device. After acquisition of axial T1w/T2w images, conventional MRC was performed through respiratory-triggered thin-slab FRFSE T2w and breath-hold thick-slab SSFSE T2w sequences. In each patient, 3D fatsuppressed breath-hold gradient-echo T1w imaging was also obtained 30-40 minutes after the intravenous administration of mangafodipir trisodium (Mn-DPDP, Teslascan\u00ae; GE Healthcare). Two experienced observers evaluated the images for the following signs: depiction of intra-and extra-hepatic bile ducts and bilio-enteric anastomosis, dilation of biliary system, presence of biliary stricture, stone and leakage. Depiction of morphologic signs was graded on images using a 3-point scale: 0, absent; 1, visible; 2, excellent. Imaging results were correlated with direct cholangiography, surgery and/or follow-up.results: The grading of visualization and depiction of dilation of the intra-hepatic bile ducts was significantly superior on T2w MRC compared with Mn-DPDPenhanced T1w MRC (p<0.0001). On T2w MRC, the extra-hepatic biliary system and the anastomotic region could be visualized in 21/26 (81%) patients, whereas on Mn-DPDP-enhanced T1w MRC visualization of bilio-enteric anastomoses and excretion of Mn-DPDP into the jejunum loop were identified in 25 out of 26 cases. Stones and biliary strictures were correctly identified with both techniques. Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced MRC using mangafodipir trisodium may provide both anatomical and functional information of bilio-enteric anastomoses. differentiation of non-calculous ampullary obstruction on mr cholangiography H.M. Kim, M.J. Kim, M. Park, J.Y. Choi, J.S. Lim, J.H. Kim, H.S. Yoo, K.W. Kim; Seoul/KR purpose: To define the criteria for differentiation of non-calculous obstruction at the ampullary level by MR cholangiography (MRC). material and methods: MRC of 41 patients (19 with ampullary cancer and 22with benign causes) with suspected non-calculous biliary obstruction at ampullary level were retrospectively reviewed. Two radiologists, who were blinded to the clinical records, determined the cause of obstruction and evaluated the presence of papillary mass and its size if present, the presence of papillary bulging, the pattern of CBD dilatation, the maximum diameters of biliary and pancreatic ducts, and the shape of the distal ends of CBD. A consensus of opinion was arrived at on all items. results: Differentiation of benign and malignant obstruction by consensus of two observers showed sensitivity (Se) of 84% and specificity (Sp) of 86%. A papillary mass was found 89% in malignancy and 27% in benign obstructions (Se 89%, Sp 77%). Mass sizes were not different between the two groups. Presence of papillary bulging showed Se of 95% and Sp of 86% and proportional dilatation of bile duct, Se 68% and Sp 95%. Dilatation of biliary duct showed Se 68% and Sp 86% and pancreatic duct, Se 47% and Sp 90%. Conclusion: The presence of ampullary mass and papillary bulging associated with proportional and severe dilatation of bililary and pancreatic ducts are suggestive findings for the diagnosis of malignant ampullary obstruction. eptFe/Fep-covered metallic stents versus uncovered mesh stents for palliation of malignant jaundice due to cholangiocarcinoma: clinical results in 50 patients M. Krokidis 1 , F. Fanelli 2 , A. Hatzidakis 1 , G. Orgera 2 , N. Gourtsoyiannis 1 , R. Passariello 2 ; 1 Heraklion/GR, 2 Rome/IT purpose: To compare clinical effectiveness of ePTFE/FEP-covered-metallic stents with uncovered mesh-stents for palliative treatment of malignant jaundice due to cholangiocarcinoma. material and methods: 50 patients with Bismuth type I-II malignant stricture due to inoperable cholangiocarcinoma without hepatic metastasis were admitted for palliation. Stricture was located in the upper CHD (without infiltrating the duct confluence) in 4 patients, in the lower CHD in 13, in the upper CBD in 22 and in the lower CBD in 11. In none of the cases there was infiltration of the cystic duct. We used 36 Wallstents (Boston Scientific), 6-9 cm long and 10 mm wide in 30 patients (Group A) and 21 Viabil (W. L. Gore) covered stents with and without side holes in 20 patients (Group B). All patients were followed-up until death. results: Technical success was 100% in both groups. Early stent occlusion was noted in 1 patient of Group B, due to sludge, and was dilated. Complication rate was 13.3% in Group A and 10% in Group B. Mean survival was 155.8 days for Group A and 170.3 days for Group B patients. One year primary patency was 54% for Group A and 77.2% for Group B. Conclusion: Viabil stents offer a significantly better 12-month primary patency rate than uncovered in the palliation of malignant strictures due to cholangiocarcinoma without hepatic metastasis.Us-guided left subxiphoid approach to the left hepatic duct for percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage: a safety and efficacy study M. Midia 1 , J. Kirby 1 , P. Vora 1 , J. Rawlinson 1 , K. Cho 2 ;Hamilton, ON/CA, 2 Ann Arbor, MI/US purpose: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the left subxiphoid approach to the liver for percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD). material and methods: 121 patients, 72 men and 49 women, with a median age of 65.8 years (range 33-99) underwent PTBD for biliary obstruction. PTBD was performed from the right intercostal approach in 50 patients and from the left subxiphoid approach in 71 patients. The left subxiphoid approach was performed under real-time US guidance. Clinical outcome to be assessed included technical success rate, pleural complications, hemorrhage, bile leakage, protection of left hepatic lobe, management of the biliary tubes, and bile leakage. results: The left subxiphoid approach to the left hepatic duct was successful in 68/71 (96%) and the right intercostal approach to the right hepatic duct was successful in 48/50 (96%). The causes for biliary obstruction included hilar duct carcinoma (40), pancreatic and periampullary carcinoma (33), metastases, pancreatitis, and postsurgical recurrence and stricture (49). Eight patients had bilateral PTBD. Complications related to the left hepatic PTBD were hemobilia (1), bile leak (0) and sepsis (2). Conclusion: The US-guided left subxiphoid approach to the left hepatic bile duct is safe and effective in treating both hilar and distal biliary ducts obstruction without significant complication.Fluoroscopically guided metallic stent placement in malignant gastroduodenal obstruction E. Bulut, T. Ciftci, F. Ozkan, F. Islim, D. Akinci, M. Ozmen, O. Akhan; Ankara/TR purpose: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of fluoroscopically guided placement of metallic stents in the palliation of malignant gastroduodenal obstruction (MGO). material and methods: Twenty-one patients (mean age: 59 years) underwent stent placement for symptoms of gastroduodenal obstruction. Underlying causes of obstruction were gastric carcinoma in 8 patients, pancreas carcinoma in 7 patients, duodenal carcinoma in 2 patients, colon carcinoma with duodenal metastasis in 2 patients, periampullary tumor and cholangiocellular carcinoma in 1 patient. Self expandable noncovered metallic stents (Wallstent, Wallflex, Niti-S) were placed under fluoroscopic guidance (20 patients) or under combination of fluoroscopic and endoscopic guidance (1 patient). Stents were placed transorally in 15 patients and percutaneous gastrostomy tract was used in 5 patients. In one patient, duodenal stent was placed by transhepatic approach. Eleven patients also underwent biliary stent placement for biliary obstruction. results: Neither mortality nor major complication was encountered. A broken stent was replaced by a new one during the procedure in one patient. Mean follow-up time was 82 days. Seventeen patients (85%) could get solid foods, 2 patients (10%) could get fluids after stent placement. Oral intake of one patient did not improve. In one patient with afferent loop obstruction, afferent loop decompression was achieved with stenting. Conclusion: Fluoroscopically guided metallic stent placement is an effective and safe method in the palliation of MGO. multisampling needle core biopsy of hepatic nodules S. Strasser, C.D. Becker, L. Rubbia-Brandt, L. Spahr, S. Terraz; Geneva/CH purpose: Multisampling needle core biopsy (NCB) has been evaluated in breast and lung lesions, but to date few data are available on hepatic nodules. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of this technique for undetermined liver nodules. material and methods: Between January 2004 and December 2006, 104 consecutive NCB were performed in 101 patients with suspected hepatic malignancy. The mean diameter of the nodules was 3.5\u00b12.7 cm (range, 0.8-16.0 cm). After local anaesthesia, a 17G outer canula was placed at the periphery of the nodule under US (n=87), CT (n=12) or MRI",

Baudin, S. Novellas, F. Berthier, E. Gelsi, G. Bernardin, X. H\u00e9buterne, P. Chevallier; Nice/FR purpose: To assess the safety and efficacy of percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) of infected acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP). material and methods: An eight-year period retrospective study including fortyeight consecutive patients (34 men, mean age: 58 y) with (ANP) treated for sepsis with one to four percutaneous catheters ranging in size from 14-to 30-French (24-French in mean). Ranson's score was equal in mean to 3.48 (range: 1-6) and CT-scans were classified Balthazar D or E, respectively, for 10.2 and 89.4% of patients. Univariate analysis using the Wilcoxon matched pairs test was performed to assess factors influencing the clinical success and the 30-days mortality rate. results: The average catheter drainage time was 47.3 days (range: 11-96), each catheter being changed in mean 7.5 times per patient. Thirty-two patients (66.6%) were cured with only percutaneous drainage and this clinical success was influenced by the Ranson's score (p: 0.01), a multiorgan failure (p: 0.009), and the delay to start the drainage (p: 0.003). The 30-days mortality rate was equal to 29.2% (fourteen patients) and was influenced by the Ranson's score (p: 0.01), a multiorgan failure (p: 0.02), the delay to start the drainage (p: 0.04), and the C reactive protein value (p: 0.03). Two patients experienced catheter-related hemorrhages which spontaneously resolved. Conclusion: PCD is a safe and effective technique for treating infected ANP.Intra-arterial chemotherapy for resectable periampullary cancer to prevent hepatic metastases (espaC-II trial): the erasmus mC experience N. Krak, J. Hermans, M. Morak, C. van Eijck; Rotterdam/NL purpose: To study the effect of celiac artery infusion (CAI) on the occurrence of hepatic metastases in patients with resectable UICC stage I-III periampullary cancer. material and methods: 120 patients were included in a prospective clinical trial and randomized to surgery, adjuvant CAI and radiotherapy (Arm A, 59 patients) or surgery alone (Arm B, 61 patients). CAI consisted of mitoxantrone, folinic acid, 5-FU and Cis-platinum at 4-weekly intervals. Six cycles were given unless toxicity or disease progression occurred. Development of liver metastases in Arm A and Arm B were compared. Technical aspects and complications of celiac axis catheter placement were recorded. results: In Arm B, 52 % of patients developed liver metastases, vs. 30% in Arm A. The percentage of liver metastases decreased from 78 to 11% with 2 vs. 6 CAI cycles. A total of 620 celiac axis catheterizations were performed in 43 patients who received at least 2 cycles of CAI. Catheters used were a celiac (90%), Sidewinder (7%) or SOS omni catheter (3%). Catheter luxations occurred in 12% of placements. Four patients experienced major complications, i.e. subtotal celiac trunk stenosis (n=2) and femoral or external iliac artery dissection (n=2). Conclusion: Prolonged CAI decreases the occurrence of liver metastases. Catheter luxations occurred in 12% of catheter placements and major catheterization-related complications in 9% of patients, respectively. radio-iodine therapy and helicobacter pylori infection: the first in vivo evidence on radiosensitivity of the bacteria A. Gholamrezanezhad, S. Mirpour; Tehran/IR purpose: Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) is the most important cause of gastritis and related morbidities. Following consumption, radioactive iodine accumulates considerably in stomach. Hence, we decided to find whether the high radiation induced by radio-iodine on stomach is effective in the eradication of H.pylori. material and methods: All consecutive patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma, who were referred for radio-iodine therapy (Dose: 117.1\u00b124.4 mCi, Range: 100-200 mCi), were enrolled. To detect H.Pylori infection, Urease Breath Test (UBT) was performed 1-2 hours before radio-iodine consumption and was repeated two-months later. results: Out of 88 patients, 71 patients had pre-treatment positive UBT. Of these, 23 patients had negative post-treatment result, which means a significant reduction (26.1%, 95% CI: 16.8-35.5%) in the number of positive UBT results of our population with treatment (32.4% of UBT positive cases became UBT negative). Conclusion: Considering the high prevalence of reinfection in developing countries, the therapeutic benefit would be more considerable if the second UBT was done with a lag time of <2 months. Although it is not a logical method for treatment of patients suffering from H.pylori, it is indirect evidence about radiosensitivity of bacteria, future clinical applications of which need to be further evaluated. Also, this finding can be useful for food industry where radiation is used in a wide scale to sterilize food. Regarding the possibility of H.pylori suppression, we recommend not using UBT for screening the infection within two months following radio-iodine. radiologically inserted gastrostomies in head and neck cancer chemoradiotherapy J.C. Jobling, P.D. Thurley; Nottingham/UK purpose: Head and neck cancer patients often develop severe mucositis from oncological treatment, requiring gastrostomies to maintain nutrition. We wished to assess success, complication and utilization rates of radiologically inserted gastrostomies (RIGs). material and methods: All oncology referrals for RIGs were identified retrospectively. Radiology reports and patient records were used to identify tube type, procedural success, complications and usage of the gastrostomy. results: 104 patients (75 males, 29 females; aged 25-85 years, mean 56.3, median 57.8) were referred for RIGs between 2004 and to date prior to chemoradiotherapy. 95 had head and neck cancers, 9 had other malignancies. 94 pull-down flanged and 10 self retaining loop catheters were inserted. Successful placement occurred in 103. One patient had an intrathoracic stomach (previous oesophagectomy); therefore, placement was not possible. 14% developed infections; in one patient, this delayed chemotherapy. 25% developed delayed stoma infections. One tube detached in the stomach during placement, requiring endoscopic retrieval. One patient developed small bowel obstruction. 1 patient died 29 days after insertion of unrelated causes. 10 (12%) had other minor complications. 73% patients used their RIGs (66% were dependent). 11% did not use their RIGs (2 did not receive any treatment). No information was available in 16%. Conclusion: RIG insertion had a high success rate and low rate of serious complication other than infection in this group. Our unit now uses prophylactic antibiotics for RIG insertion.SS 15.06 management of chronic mesenteric ischemia with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty: short-and longterm outcomes R. Loffroy, V.

Sosna; Jerusalem/IL purpose: Aortic and visceral artery pathologies can cause sudden death if left untreated.Conventional 2D and 3D reconstructions are generally adequate for vascular surgeons and angiographers but their ability to show complex 3D anatomical relationships can be limited. A promising new technique enables the creation of 3D models of vascular structures using computer-aided fabrication and polymer deposition to build plastic models based on MDCT 3D image data. Our purpose was to evaluate the usefulness of this technique for the treatment of vascular diseases. material and methods: From April 2005 to April 2007, we fashioned models for 4 male and 4 female patients aged 38-70 with abdominal, thoracoabdominal and hepatic aneurysms. CT imaging was performed on a 64-slice MDCT scanner (Brilliance 64, Philips Medical). Volumetric data was acquired. DICOM data was converted to stereolithography (STL) format. A photopolymer jetting device (Eden 500, Objet, Rehovot, Israel) \"printed\" alternate super-thin layers (down to 16 microns/0.0006 inches) of hard curable plastic and a gel-like photopolymer support material at 600 x 300 dpi to create the model. Final surgical results were gathered and the planning was assessed on a semi-quantitative scale. results: Rapid prototyping models accurately depicted the anatomic details of the vascular structure. Final surgical and endovascular results were considered excellent by the vascular surgeons and enabled real time use in the OR. Planning score improved from 1.8 to 2.3 on a 0-3 scale. Conclusion: Reconstruction of vascular structures with rapid prototyping models generated is feasible, easing planning of surgery and endovascular treatment. Larger-scale studies for complex reconstructive surgery are underway.treatment of plicature-induced transplant renal artery stenosis by primary stenting: technical results and clinical outcome P. Goffette 1 , M. Mourad 1 , J.P. Squifflet 2 , E. Danse 1 , J.P. Lerut 1 ;Brussels/BE, 2 Liege/BE purpose: To evaluate the technical feasibility and clinical results of stenting of plicature-induced transplant renal artery (TRA) stenosis. material and methods: Over an eight-year period, stent placement was considered in 12 patients to manage plicature-induced TRA stenosis. All cadaveric arteries were anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion to the common iliac artery via an aortic patch. Patients suffered from severe hypertension (n=2), impaired renal function (n=2), or both (n=8). In all patients, stent implantation was performed immediately after complete recoil of post-anastomotic arterial plicature after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Palmaz (n=4), Herculink (n=6), or Tsunami (n=2) stents were placed to straighten the artery and keep the stenotic area open. results: Stent placement was 100% successful. The renal artery peak blood flow velocity fell from 324\u00b165 to 154\u00b118 cm/s. The mean systolic blood pressure fell from 175\u00b132 to 135\u00b118 mm Hg. Allograft function improved in eight patients (serum creatinine from 3.2\u00b11.1 to 1.5\u00b10.4 mg/dl) and stabilized in two. During the follow-up period (3 month-9.5 years, median 5 years), asymptomatic <50%intrastent stenosis were left untreated in three patients. Redo-transplantation was performed in two patients because of irreversible renal failure due to refractory intrastent stenosis (n=1) and recurrent glomerulonephritis (n=1). Conclusion: Stents placement revealed very useful in managing plicatureinduced TRA stenosis. Medium-term stent patency and clinical outcome are promising. Redo-surgery or re-tranplantation is avoided in most patients.pelvic abscesses: results of percutaneous drainage O. Ergun, T. Ciftci, O. Temizoz, D. Akinci, M. Ozmen, O. Akhan; Ankara/TR purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous drainage (PD) of pelvic abscesses (PA) with follow-up results. material and methods: A retrospective evaluation of PD of 98 PA in 83 patients (58 female, 25 male) was performed. Mean age of the patients was 49 (9-80 years). Transabdominal route was used in 72 abscesses and the remaining 26 abscesses were drained by transvaginal, transgluteal and transrectal routes. CT guidance was used in 12 abscesses, whereas 86 abscesses were drained under US and fluoroscopy guidance. Catheter drainage was used in 93 abscesses with 8-14F locking pigtail catheters; remaining 5 abscesses were drained by simple aspiration.results: There were no periprocedural complications. Initial cure and failure rates were 35.7% (35/98) and 8.2 (8/98), respectively. Fifty-five abscesses were either palliated or temporized. Recurrence rate was 5.1% (5/98), and 4 of them were treated by recatheterization. Overall success and failure rates with temporized, palliated and recatheterized abscesses were 96 (94/98) and 4% (4/98), respectively. Thirty-day mortality rate was 7.2% (6/83). Mean catheterization time was 13 days (2-52 days) and mean follow-up time was 16 months (1-53 months). Conclusion: PD of PA under imaging guidance is a safe and effective procedure.difficulty of evaluating this area and the importance of its correct assessment in routine hepatobiliary MR and MRCP studies. To differentiate normal variants and benign conditions such as spasm or papillitis from malignancy. Background: Hepatobiliary MR and MR cholangiography have become routine examinations in most MR departments as useful tools to depict the biliary tree and the pancreatic ducts. However, assessment of the Ampulla of Vater area remains a challenge for the radiologist, due to a variety of normal appearances and benign conditions that may mimic malignancy. Imaging findings or procedure details: In this exhibit, we will first describe the technical details of the MR exploration, then illustrate and describe the spectrum of normal (open papilla, spastic papilla) and postoperative appearances of the papilla (common bile duct stump) as well as its pathologic conditions (papillitis, periampullary diverticulum, cholangitis, pancreatitis or groove pancreatitis, choledochocele and tumors such as intraductal papillary mucinous tumor, ampullary adenoma and carcinoma). Conclusion: MR has proved effective in depicting the biliary tree and demonstrating many of its pathologic conditions such as dilatation, choledocholithiasis or tumors. It is essential to be familiar with the normal and postoperative appearances of the papilla in order to be able to rule out pathology of this anatomic region.Learning objectives: Describe the MRI technique for CAC evaluation.

Besa Correa, A. Huete Garin; Santiago/CL Learning objectives: To present a spectrum of findings of biliary duct alterations associated with AIP illustrated by MRCP and MRI. Background: Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a form of chronic pancreatitis with a background of fibrosis and a lymphoplasmacytic infiltration. The most common extrapancreatic organ involved is the biliary tree, with narrowing of the distal common bile duct (CBD) and sclerosing cholangitis (SC) being the major associated findings described. Imaging findings or procedure details: We retrospectively reviewed the MR and MRCP imaging findings of 16 patients with AIP diagnosed or treated in our institution between 2001 and 2007. MR were analyzed for the following features: presence and location of biliary strictures and wall thickening, presence of a SC pattern defined as multifocal intrahepatic disease with one or more strictures with or without extrahepatic bile duct involvement, presence of a peribiliary mass and gallbladder involvement. We identified four major patterns of compromise: distal CBD stricture (31%), extrahepatic bile duct disease (suprapancreatic) (31%), SC (31%) and a central peribiliary mass (25%). In two patients (12.5%), a diffuse gallbladder involvement was noted. Conclusion: Bile ducts alterations in AIP are well know features of this multisystemic disease, where distal biliary involvement mimics pancreatic cancer-related stricture and suprapancreatic and intrahepatic involvement may simulate a cholangiocarcinoma or primary SC. Thus, adequate diagnosis is crucial, since steroid therapy can lead to recovery.Cholangiocarcinoma: mr findings J.M.G. Louren\u00e7o, C. Lam, R. Santos, A. Marques, I. Oliveira, M.E. Silva, Z. Seabra; Lisbon/PT Learning objectives:To review the imaging characteristics of CC in MR. To discuss the different patterns of presentation, the differential diagnosis and resectability evaluation. Background: Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is an uncommon malignancy. It is an adenocarcinoma that may arise from any part of the bile duct epithelium, being classified in intrahepatic periferical, intrahepatic hilar (Klatskin tumour) and extrahepatic. Three growth patterns are known: exophytic, infiltrative and polypoid. The extrahepatic and hilar forms usually present as obstructive jaundice. The intrahepatic form as to be differentiated from other liver masses. With the proximity of several vascular structures and the infiltrative nature of the tumour, resectability evaluation is a major issue, where MR has clear advantages over other techniques. Imaging findings or procedure details: By reviewing the clinical and MR findings of patients with CC in our archive, we present a clear illustration of the different growth patterns, localizations and resectability criteria, including the infiltration extent of the biliary tree, lobar atrophy, vascular invasion (venous and arterial) and metastization. We used a combination of MR cholangiography and cross sectional pre and post gadolinium enhanced acquisitions. Conclusion: CC can present in different locations and forms that may overlap other conditions. Familiarity with the spectrum of radiologic presentation and an understanding of the staging criteria may lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic accuracy. normal mr and pathologic Conditions of the ampullary area: a pictorial essay X.

Ba\u015faran, F. Yildirim Donmez, E.M. Kayahan Ulu, A. Ozturk, M. Coskun; Ankara/TR purpose: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the MDCT features of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC), correlating the pathologic findings. material and methods: Retrospective analysis was performed in 13 patients with pathologically diagnosed XGC from January 2002 to December 2007. The patients were 7 women and 6 men with a mean age of 63 years. All patients had preoperative CT examination. CT scans of the abdomen were performed with 16-row MDCT (Sensation, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The following MDCT features were evaluated: maximum wall thickness, intramural hypodense nodules, mucosal line, patterns of wall thickening and enhancement, surrounding fat, surrounding liver and the presence of stones. results: The mean thickness of the gallbladder wall was 1.1 cm (diffuse in eleven patients and focal in two patients). Intramural hypodense nodules were seen in all patients. The mucosal line was observed in all patients (continuous in four and focally disrupted in nine). On CT, intramural hypodense nodules in the wall of XGC correlated with foam and inflammatory cells or necrosis and/or abcess in XGC. Continuous mucosal line of gallbladder wall represented preservation of the epithelial layer. The early-enhanced areas of the liver bed on dynamic CT images corresponded to accumulation of inflammatory cells and fibrosis. Conclusion: Although the preoperative imaging diagnosis of XGC is difficult, our results indicate that MDCT findings correlate well with the histopathologic findings of XGC.",

Ragozzino 2 ; Naples/IT, 2 Pozzuoli (NA)/IT purpose: We assessed the role of mangafodipir (Teslascan)-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiography in the detection and location of bile duct leaks after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. material and methods: Between June 2006 and December 2007, 13 patients with clinical suspicion of bile duct leak after cholecystectomy underwent MRI.MR studies were performed on a 1.5-T scanner. The study included axial heavily T2-weighted images, 3D MR cholangiography and three-dimensional T1weighted MR prior to and 30 minutes in average after IV administration of mangafodipir trisodium. results: On the non contrast-enhanced, the bile collection was visualized in 13 patients, the bile duct discontinuity in 3 patients and residual calculosis in 2 patients. On CE, MR images the fistula between bile duct and collection was visualized in 9 patients; in 4 patients the fistula not was visible. The results were correlated to surgery (n=7), endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (n=2), and clinical follow-up (n=4). Conclusion: Mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced MR cholangiography is a non invasive technique that can successfully detect the presence of bile duct leaks. The combination of T2 weighted MR cholangiography and mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced T1 weighted MR cholangiography increases the sensitivity in detection and localization of the site of bile leak compared with the non CE MR cholangiography alone. the double duct sign on Ct: referral practice in a tertiary referral centre E.M.Godfrey, D. Humphries, A. Roseman, N. Carroll;   Cambridge/UK purpose: The double duct sign describes simultaneous dilatation of the common bile duct (CBD) and pancreatic duct (PD). We examined whether patients with this finding on CT, but without an obstructing mass, were appropriately referred for endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). material and methods: A radiology database was interrogated for CT examinations with the double duct sign for 18 months following 1.1.06. Patients were followed up using electronic histology and clinical record databases. results: 66 patients with the double duct sign were identified. 36 had no obstructing mass visible on CT. Of these 36 patients, 12 were not referred for further imaging on the basis of radiological findings (metastatic disease at presentation or longstanding CBD/PD dilatation). Of the remaining 24 patients, 3 were deemed unfit for surgery and conservatively managed. 3 died soon after the initial CT. 18 patients were therefore retrospectively considered to have been suitable candidates for EUS. 8/18 patients not referred for EUS but were followed up with ERCP, CT or US. 10/18 patients were referred for EUS. The findings were benign in 7/10. 2/10 were palliated for unresectable malignancy. 1/10 underwent a Whipple's procedure for a resectable ampullary tumour. Conclusion: There is variation in referral for imaging following the CT double duct sign. We propose that in patients with double duct dilatation and no obstructing mass, the reporting radiologist should explicitly recommend referral for EUS to improve the chances of diagnosing resectable disease.the value of mr cholangiography in early and late postcholecystectomy biliary disorders F. Palmieri 1 , B. Cusati 2 , G. Di Costanzo 1 , A. Ragozzino 1 ;Pozzuoli (NA)/IT, 2 Naples/IT purpose: To assess the role of magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiography in early and late postcholecystectomy syndrome. material and methods: One hundred and two patients had a clinical suspicion of post-cholecistectomy syndrome, 42 with an early and 60 with a late syndrome. All patients underwent single slab 2D Haste and 3D multislice T2 weighted and post-contrast 3D gradient-echo sequences, with Maximal Intensity Projection reconstructions. Two readers, unaware of surgical, histopathologic, or other imaging findings, independently reviewed the MR cholangiographic images. Final diagnoses were established with surgery, imaging other than MR or followup. results: Forty two patients with early postcholecystectomy syndrome showed iatrogenic bile duct lesions (n=20); iatrogenic vascular lesions (n=3), biliary leaks (n=9), functional syndrome (n=10). Sixty patients with late post-cholecystectomy syndrome showed bile duct stones (n=38), bilomas (n=3); bile duct stones (n=6); mucocele of cystic duct (n=5), cholangitis (n=4) and functional syndrome (n=4). The two readers had an excellent interobserver agreement (kappa=0.82). Conclusion: MR cholangiography is an accurate, noninvasive modality for the assessment of postcholecystectomy biliary disorders, able to distinguish functional from organic syndrome and identify the causes.multimodality imaging of biliary dilatation L. Goncalves, S.C.C. Dias, H. Torr\u00e3o, S. Kurochka, A.C. Costa, V. Mendes, C. Pina Vaz; Braga/PT Learning objectives:We review multimodality imaging of benign and malignant BD, valuing its diagnostic and therapeutic contributes. Background: Biliary dilation (BD) is a common problem, most frequently caused by benign acquired strictures, but that can also be originated by malignancy. So early diagnosis is mandatory, in order to plan appropriate and timely management. Ultrasonography (US) is frequently the first technique performed, providing fundamental diagnostic information. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) allow extensive extrabilary imaging and aid in determining the severity of dilation and the precise level and extent of obstruction, strongly contributing to the final etiology and staging of malignancy, thus enabling helpful diagnostic and therapeutic data. Imaging findings or procedure details: We illustrate US, CT and cross-sectional and cholangiography MR (CMR) distinguishing features of various benign and malignant forms of BD. Among the benign, we consider congenital and inflammatory causes, strictures, lithiasis, parasites and extrinsic compression by liver cyst. CMR was especially useful in characterizing intraluminal disease, frequently avoiding diagnostic retrograde cholangiography. Special emphasis is given to distinction between benign and malignant obstruction, with extrabiliary as well as ductal and dilation related key features being pointed out. The management impact of the dilation degree, level and extent of obstruction, and of staging are also exemplified. Conclusion: Multimodality imaging techniques of BD are complementary, providing crucial diagnostic and therapeutic features, which often avoid diagnostic invasive procedures.anatomic variations of the bile duct bifurcation: diagnosis with mrCp F.Obuz, A. Ucar, F. Uysal, M. Secil, E. Igci, O. Dicle;  Izmir/TR purpose: Anatomic variations of the bile ducts may complicate surgeries such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy and living donor liver transplantation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency of anatomic variations of the bile duct bifurcation (BDB) using MRCP. material and methods:Between May 2002 and December 2007, 1160 consecutive patients suspected with pancreatobiliary disease and referred to our department to be performed MRCP were reviewed retrospectively. MRCP examination was performed on a 1.5 Tesla MR unit using phased-array coil. In all patients, single slice and multi-slice TSE T2 weighted and high resolution 3D-TSE T2 weighted paracoronal images were obtained. Two reviewers evaluated the presence of anatomic variants. results: One hundred forty-nine patients were excluded from analysis because the MR examination did not image the biliary bifurcation clearly. The BDB was demonstrated in 803 patients (79.4%). Trifurcation was found in 8% patients, an aberrant right hepatic duct emptying into the common hepatic duct was demonstrated in 7.2% patients, and right dorsocaudal branch draining into the left hepatic duct was shown in 4.1% patients.Conclusion: MRCP is helpful and a non-invasive technique in the diagnosis of bile duct variations.

Knowing therapeutic implications of radiological findings in diverticulitis. Background: The management of left colon diverticulitis remains controversial.Adequate patient selection for surgery is the key to reduce morbility and mortality. Surgeons rely on radiologists to diagnose and stage patients according to the modified Hinchey classification. Although CT scanning is the most frequently used technique to image these patients, ultrasonography may be an important tool in this setting. Imaging findings or procedure details: Stages 0, 1a and 1b with abscess smaller than 5 cm can be managed with diet and antibiotic therapy. Stages 1b and 2 with percutaneous approachable abscess larger than 5 cm are treated on NPO with antibiotic and drainage. Non approachable abscess and stages 3 and 4 require urgent surgery. Radiologists play a central role in classifying each patient and giving the surgeon the precise information they need for an adequate patient management. CT should be considered in case of pneumoperitoneum on X-rays or ultrasonographic evidence of: peritoneal stripe enhancement sign, free abdominal fluid, bad delimited collection, non percutaneous approachable collection larger than 5 cm or open communication with bowel lumen. Conclusion: Imaging strategies combining US and CT are critical in selecting the most adequate treatment for patients with acute diverticulitis. Ultrasonography may be useful in identifying patients at early stages (0 and 1a) avoiding unnecessary ionizing radiation.",

Teixeira, F. Caseiro-Alves; Coimbra/PT Learning objectives: To recognize the CT signs of solid organ, bowel, mesenteric and diaphragmatic injuries from blunt trauma. To differentiate CT findings indicative of significant injury from those indicative of nonsignificant injury. Background: Blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality among patients admitted to trauma centers after sustaining multiple traumatic injuries. Although abdominal injuries are often suspected in this setting, clinical diagnosis can be challenging due to the lack of specific physical findings in many patients. CT has been shown to be accurate for the diagnosis of solid organ, bowel, mesenteric and diaphragmatic injuries and is the diagnostic test of choice in the evaluation of patients with BAT. Imaging findings or procedure details: In this exhibit we describe and illustrate: 1. The diagnostic evaluation of the patient with BAT. 2. The CT protocols used to perform optimal examinations. 3. The CT findings in: 3.1 Liver trauma; 3.2 Splenic trauma; 3.3 Pancreaticobiliary Trauma; 3.4 Genitourinary Trauma; 3.5 Bowel injury; 3.6 Mesenteric injury; and 3.7 Diaphragmatic injury. Conclusion: Solid organ, bowel, mesenteric and diaphragmatic injuries from BAT may be significant and require immediate surgery or may be nonsignificant and permit nonsurgical treatment. CT is the diagnostic test of choice in the evaluation of these patients and is instrumental to guide treatment planning.",

When to perform a MDCT on a patient who has suffered a blunt abdominal trauma? 2. How to plan and carry out the MDCT? 3. What radiologic findings do we need to be familiar with to provide an accurate radiologic report? Background: The actual trend in diagnostic imaging with respect to blunt abdominal trauma is to achieve a fast and accurate diagnosis of the traumatic lesions. To this end, a thorough knowledge of the indications, technical aspects and imaging findings of each modality is essential. Imaging findings or procedure details: We divide blunt abdominal trauma patients into three categories: A. Hemodynamically unstable patients. B. Hemodynamically stable patients. C. Hemodynamically stable patients with hematuria. To provide an adequate scanning protocol MDCT to evaluate abdominal damage in as little as 2 minutes, providing data about vascular and visceral lesions. To describe and to illustrate the most important radiologic findings (haemoperitoneum, active haemorrhage and major visceral damage) with examples from our own practice.

To illustrate the imaging findings (plain X-ray, US, and CT) of the various diseases causing left lower quadrant abdominal pain. To understand the appropriate use and role of different imaging modalities. Background: The left lower quadrant (LLQ) abdominal pain can be a real challenge to the radiologists as unlike right lower quadrant pain its causes are not well understood. The differential diagnosis of left lower quadrant abdominal pain are: sigmoid diverticulitis; leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm; renal colic; epididymitis; incarcerated hernia; bowel obstruction; regional enteritis; paninculitis, psoas abscess; and in rare instances, situs inversus with acute appendicitis. Imaging findings or procedure details: In this exhibit, we demonstrate imaging findings and tailored approach for rapid and reasonable evaluation of Learning objectives: To address the advantages and drawbacks of CT in the study of acute abdominal conditions. To illustrate various diagnoses readily apparent on CT and to show common mimickers. Background: The term \"acute abdomen\" corresponds to a clinical syndrome characterized by sudden onset of abdominal pain requiring emergency treatment, being nowadays one of the commonest conditions in patients admitted to emergency departments. Prompt diagnosis is essential for minimizing morbidity and mortality, but it can be challenging since clinical-laboratory findings are often non-specific, creating the need for efficient imaging techniques. As a result, CT is being increasingly performed in this setting. Imaging findings or procedure details: Acute conditions will be shown according to a topographic classification of pain (one of four abdominal quadrants, epigastric, generalized or flank pain). For each location, examples of the most common conditions will be illustrated, such as acute cholecystitis (RUQ), pancreatitis (LUQ, epigastrium), diverticulitis (LLQ), appendicitis (RLQ), bowel obstruction, GI perforation and mesenteric ischemia (generalized) or urinary colic (flank), as well as other conditions that need to be taken into account in the differential diagnosis. Conclusion: CT is increasingly being seen as the first-line examination in patients with acute abdomen, lacking the disadvantages of plain films and US and replacing them in a wide spectrum of situations. It has gained the status of \"goldstandard\" over the last years, particularly after the developments in MDCT.",

            "text": "rectus sheath hematoma: Ct findings B. Acu, B. Sarikaya, U. Bekar, Y. Akturk; Tokat/TR purpose: Rectus sheath hematoma (RSH) is an uncommon cause of acute abdominal pain. It is an accumulation of blood in the sheath of the rectus abdominis secondary to rupture of an epigastric vessel or muscle tear. We present clinical, laboratory and imaging findings accompanying with literature knowledge. material and methods: Between January and July 2007, at ages between 47 and 76, two males and three females of a total five patients with acute abdominal pain and palpable abdominal mass were examined with CT. results: At CT examination, two patients in right rectus muscle, two patients in left rectus muscle and one patient in both rectus muscles were seen compatible with hematoma. All of the patients had abdominal mass and have undergone anticoagulant therapy. All of the patients had anemia and leukocytosis. Four patients were treated conservatively and one was showing clinical recovery after a surgery. Conclusion: RSH is observed frequently by an acute abdominal pain and a palpable mass and mimicking an acute intraabdominal pathology. The most common presenting feature is a painful lower abdominal mass that never crossing the midline. Most important predisposing factor is anticoagulant therapy. At the diagnosis of RSH, CT examination is gold standard. RSH is generally treated conservatively. In conclusion, in old patients with acute abdominal pain, infraumblical mass, anemia and using anticoagulant therapy, rectus sheath hematoma should be kept in mind. A careful evaluation of the medical history and clinical suspicion will help to make an accurate diagnosis and avoid an unnecessary laparotomy. To propose a classification for vascular causes of acute abdominal pain based on \"vascular rupture\", \"vascular occlusion\", \"diminished flow\" and \"solid organ ischemia\". 3. To present selected cases that illustrate the relevance of image in the clinical management of patients. Background: MDCT angiography is the preferred method for imaging in emergent abdominal vascular conditions. It enables the acquisition of highspatial-resolution volumetric data, including small distal visceral branches, as well the aorta and iliac arteries during a single breath hold. Familiarity with the techniques of image acquisition, contrast dynamics, volumetric data postprocessing and interpretation is as important as exact knowledge of the physiology of the lesions. Imaging findings or procedure details: We present images following this classification proposal: (1) The accuracy of the clinical diagnosis and the added value of US and CT in patients with suspected acute cholecystitis (AC) were investigated. material and methods: Sensitivity, specificity and post-test probability of the clinical diagnosis AC were calculated in consecutive emergency department patients with acute non-traumatic abdominal pain. The accuracy of the clinical triad (direct tenderness RUQ, fever and leucocytosis) was also assessed. Posttest probabilities after US and CT in suspected patients were calculated to investigate the added value on top of clinical assessment. results: Prevalence of AC was 5% (52/1021). AC was the clinical diagnosis in 62 patients and was present in 29, yielding a sensitivity of 56% (95% CI: 42-69%). The clinical triad was 100% sensitive and specific, but present in only 8% of AC. Post-test probability for AC after clinical assessment was 46%, which increased to 88% after a positive US or CT in suspected patients. A negative test result decreased the post-test probability to 16% for US and to 19% for CT. US and CT reduced the 33 false-positive clinical diagnoses to 3 false-positives. Amsterdam/NL, 2 Nieuwegein/NL, 3 Apeldoorn/NL, 4 Utrecht/ NL, 5 Hilversum/NL purpose: At the emergency department (ED) plain radiographs are often used as initial imaging modality in patients with acute abdominal pain (AAP). We evaluated the added value of plain radiographs on top of clinical assessment. material and methods: Patients presenting to the ED with abdominal pain prospectively underwent both supine abdominal and upright chest plain radiographs. The treating physician recorded per patient the most likely diagnoses after clinical assessment and after radiographs. Reference standard was final diagnosis after 6 months follow-up. Sensitivity, specificity and change in primary diagnosis were calculated for diagnoses to be made at radiography as bowelobstruction, perforated viscus, and urinary tract stones. results: 1021 consecutive patients, 566 female, mean age 47, were included. Sensitivity of bowel-obstruction was significant higher after radiographs 74% (95% CI: 0.63-0.84) than after clinical assessment 57% (95% CI: 0.46-0.69) (p<0.01). Primary diagnosis changed in 11 patients from another diagnosis into bowel-obstruction, albeit not significant (p=0.06). Sensitivity of urinary tract stones was higher after radiographs, although not significant, 48% (95% CI: 0.28-0.68) versus 68% (95% CI 0.41-0.79) (p=0.375). Sensitivity of perforated viscus did not change after radiographs 15% (95% CI 0.04-0.40 versus 95% CI: 0.04-0.42) (p=1.00). For urinary tract stones and perforated viscus, primary diagnosis did not change significantly between clinical assessment and radiographs (p=0.375 and p=0.45, respectively). Conclusion: There is no added value of plain radiographs after clinical evaluation of non-selected patients with AAP at the ED, even for bowel-obstruction.",

The percentage of missed appendicitis and the negative appendectomy rate (false positives (FP)/all positives) were calculated for US usage only and subsequently for US combined with CT in females with an inconclusive or negative US or females with only an inconclusive US. results: We included 1021 patients, (55% female; mean age 47 year (19-94)). Acute appendicitis was clinically suspected in 226 females and was present in 104 (pre-test probability: 46%). CT usage in females with an inconclusive US (85/226=38%) would reduce the percentage of missed appendicitis from 24 (25/104) to 8.7% (9/104) as compared to US only, but increase the negative appendectomy rate from 15.9 (15/94) to 20.8% (25/120). CT in all female patients with a negative US (including inconclusives; 132/226=58%) would further reduce the missed appendicitis percentage to 4.8% (5/104), but increase the negative appendectomy rate to 21.4%.

Torreggiani; Dublin/IE Learning objectives: We describe the diagnosis of gallbladder adenomyomatosis on US, CT and MRI, and correlate the characteristic pathological findings with those first described on cholecystography. Background: Adenomyomatosis is a relatively common abnormality of the gallbladder with a reported incidence of 2.8-5%. It is characterized pathologically by excessive proliferation of the surface epithelium and hypertrophy of the muscularis propria, with invagination of the mucosa into the thickened muscularis, forming characteristic Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses. Occasionally, focal adenomyomatosis may mimic gallbladder carcinoma, making accurate diagnosis of this as a distinct pathological entity essential. Imaging findings or procedure details: Visualization of the characteristic Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses on US may be difficult due to factors such as obesity, gallbladder calculi and interruption of the beam by bowel gas and the diagnosis is now made more commonly on cross-sectional imaging. Contrast-enhanced CT in the arterial phase best shows enhancement of the mucosal layer of the gallbladder and therefore, the mucosal outpouching into the thickened muscularis. However, we have found MRI using a heavily T2-weighted HASTE sequence to most accurately depict the characteristic features of adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder and associated biliary tract disease. Conclusion: While CT has been shown to be superior to US and cholecystography, MRI using T2-weighted images has been shown to be the most accurate modality for diagnosing gallbladder adenomyomatosis, with a reported accuracy of over 90%.",

Background: Different primary malignancies have different lymphatic drainage pathways. Proper assessment of lymphatic spread requires careful evaluation of specific pathways. CT plays a central role in diagnosing, staging, management and follow-up of GI malignancies. It is a non-invasive, available diagnostic tool which also allows determination of the most appropriate approach for nodal sampling and helps in the detection of recurrent disease. Imaging findings or procedure details: The authors make a comprehensive review on pathways for lymphatic spread in GI malignancies including oesophagus, stomach, liver, pancreas, biliary system, small bowel and colon. Schematic representations and CT images illustrate these pathways.

Background: Pelvic retroperitoneal cystic masses (PRCM), which arise within the retroperitoneal space but outside the major organs of that compartment, are uncommon. However, the widespread use of computed tomography (CT) for evaluating abdominal and retroperitoneal diseases has increased the detection rate of retroperitoneal cystic lesions. CT is an ideal tool for assessment of retroperitoneal disease because it provides discrete sectional images of the organs and retroperitoneal compartments.

Jhaveri, M.A. Haider; Toronto, ON/CA purpose: Heterogeneity can be seen in adrenal adenomas on CT. Mean attenuation does not account for heterogeneity and histograms can be affected by noise. The purpose of this study was to determine the range of attenuation that can be seen in fat rich versus fat poor adenoma regions using voxel by voxel comparative chemical shift MRI (CSMRI) analysis. material and methods: A single unenhanced CT and CSMRI slice could be coregistered for 23/36 adenomas using ImageJ software allowing for voxel by voxel comparison. Lipid rich voxels were defined as having >25% drop in signal intensity on CSMRI. Five of 23 (22%) adenomas were heterogenous (HetAd) having at least 2% and no more than 98% lipid poor voxels. results: The mean attenuation of HetAd was 12 HU (8-23 HU). The mean attenuation was >10 HU in all lipid poor regions. On a voxel by voxel basis, 15% (520/3548) of voxels were lipid poor. There was a significant correlation between signal drop on CSMRI and CT attenuation (r=-0.632, p<0.001). Mean CT attenuation was significantly higher in lipid poor voxels (27.7 HU vs 10.8 HU, p<0.0001). On an adenoma by adenoma basis, 4 (36/957) to 42% (289/677) of the voxels in each adenoma were lipid poor. Conclusion: True lipid poor regions can occupy sizeable subregions of HetAd.

Odev; Konya/TR purpose: The aim of this study is to illustrate examples of the diagnostic imaging modalities. We also discuss the main differential diagnosis. material and methods: We illustrate a variety of radiological findings on US, CT and MRI in cases seen in our institution. Typical findings, unusual locations (pancreas, kidney, diaphragm, peritoneum, adnexial and perivesical) and complicated cases (peritoneal seeding, biliary communications) are described. Secondary involvement due to peritoneal seeding may be seen in almost any anatomic location and may cause important problems in the differential diagnosis. results: Hydatid disease was correctly diagnosed by the combination of clinical history, imaging findings and serologic test results. Conclusion: Hydatid disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis in all patients presenting cystic lesions of the abdomen in areas where the disease is endemic. ",
