            "text": "Diarrheal disease remains one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. The problem is particularly acute among young children, who will have an estimated 10\u201315 episodes of diarrhea in the first 5 years of life1 and among whom 1.5\u20132.5 million deaths will occur each year.2, 3 For up to half of all episodes, an etiologic agent cannot be found. The importance of viral agents as causes of diarrheal disease has been increasingly appreciated, beginning with the discovery of rotavirus4 and caliciviruses5 in the 1970s. More recently, advances in detection methods for some other viruses, such as astroviruses and enteric adenoviruses, have led us to appreciate their role as causes of diarrheal disease. In addition, a variety of other viruses, such as picobirnaviruses, coronaviruses, toroviruses, parechoviruses, bocaviruses, and even influenza (H1N1) have been associated with gastroenteritis, but their clinical and public health importance remains unclear (Table 63.1\n). Many of these viruses may be responsible for the fraction of illness for which a pathogen cannot be found. A better understanding of their epidemiology will have implications for programs to decrease morbidity and mortality in developing countries.",

Since 1990, improvements in diagnostic methods, including the adaptation of astrovirus to grow in continuous cell lines,7 sequencing and elucidation of the structure of the genome,8, 9, 10 and development of improved methods of detection such as enzyme immunoassays and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction,11, 12, 13, 14 have led to new insights into the role of astrovirus in human disease. It is now clear that astroviruses are a common cause of sporadic gastroenteritis among children and may be associated with large-scale outbreaks of diarrhea as well.",

In temperate climates, astrovirus diarrhea cases peak in winter,17, 19, 24, 29, 31 whereas the seasonality is less clear in tropical settings.32, 44, 46 With improvements in detection methods, astrovirus represents an important cause of community-acquired and nosocomial illness and may be the most common viral cause of gastroenteritis in children after rotavirus and possibly Norwalk-like viruses.19 In developing countries, astroviruses have generally been detected in less than 10% of young children treated for gastroenteritis in outpatient clinics or in hospitals, and the lower proportions reported from some studies (<1%\u20133%) may reflect insensitive detection methods rather than true prevalence.19, 21, 42, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50 Even so, one study in rural Mexico has found astrovirus to be the most common cause of diarrhea in the first 3 years of life, causing 26% of diarrheal episodes in a prospectively followed cohort.32 Outbreaks of astrovirus gastroenteritis have been reported in schools,36, 37 day-care centers,25, 51, 52 hospitals,26, 29, 39, 53, 54 nursing homes,38, 40 and households.32, 55 Nosocomial spread of astroviruses may be common.56 While the modes of transmission are still unknown, the primary mode of spread of virus is likely to be through fecal-oral contamination via person-to-person contact,33, 35, 36, 53 although the stability of the virus in water may indicate that waterborne spread is possible.57\n",
