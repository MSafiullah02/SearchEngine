            "text": "Although the etiology of most neuroautoimmune, neuroinflammatory, and/or neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear, virus infections could directly trigger neurodegeneration or initiate a CNS-directed inflammatory process leading to central nervous system (CNS) damage, or a combination of both. Indeed, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS) could actually represent infectious diseases Calne et al., 1986, Kristensson, 1992, Kirk and Zhou, 1996, Allen et al., 1996, Hayase and Tobita, 1997, Klein et al., 1999, Boucher et al., 2001, Jubelt and Berger, 2001, Giraud et al., 2001, Sola et al., 2002. Moreover, psychiatric disorders were also investigated as a possible consequence of viral infections Waltrip et al., 1995, Lewis, 2001. The vertebrate CNS was long thought to be inaccessible to cells of the immune system or to viruses. However, the presence of virus in the CNS is more frequent than expected and viral detection in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients suggests the ability of viruses to cross the blood-brain barrier Koskiniemi and Vaheri, 1989, Georgsson, 1994. In fact, neuroinvasive viruses can damage the CNS and produce neurological disease in sensitive hosts, due to the misdirected immune response of the host (virus-induced immunopathology) and/or viral replication in cells of the brain (virus-induced cytopathology). Nevertheless, primary infections of the brain are not common and viruses are the leading cause of encephalitis, which results from either direct infection (acute encephalitis) or the immune response to an infection (postinfectious encephalitis or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis). In acute encephalitis, viral replication occurs in the brain tissue itself, causing destructive lesions of the gray matter: this was reported after herpes simplex, rabies, or some arbovirus infections Rupprecht et al., 2002, Shoji et al., 2002. Therefore, the knowledge of infectious agents involved in neurological diseases and mechanisms underlying the induction of neuropathology by these pathogens will be invaluable for preventing and developing novel clinical interventions.",

Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are recognized respiratory pathogens responsible for up to 35% of common colds McIntosh, 1996, Myint, 1994 and also involved in nocosomial infections (Sizun et al., 2000). They have occasionally been associated with other pathologies, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and enteritis Riski and Hovi, 1980, Resta et al., 1985. Moreover, HCoV have the ability to replicate and persist in human neural cells Bonavia et al., 1997, Arbour et al., 1999a,b) and to have neuroinvasive properties Burks et al., 1980, Murray et al., 1992, Stewart et al., 1992, Arbour et al., 2000. This has stimulated research on their possible involvement in neurological disorders. Of the two known HCoV serotypes, designated OC43 and 229E, HCoV-OC43 is antigenically related to murine coronaviruses (MHV). Given that, under certain conditions, MHV causes experimental CNS inflammatory demyelination that pathologically resembles MS Bailey et al., 1949, Lampert et al., 1973, Weiner, 1973, Wang et al., 1990, the related human coronavirus represents a logical target for investigation.",

An intraperitoneal inoculation with a virus dose of 105 TCID50 revealed that HCoV-OC43 virus infection could be lethal until 8 days postnatal (DPN) and the same doses were nonlethal at 21 DPN. With an intraoral inoculation of 104\u2013105 TCID50 of virus, we were unable to reveal the presence of virus or virus gene products in any tissue tested (brain, spinal cord, heart, lung, liver, and spleen), even by RT-PCR. Mice were susceptible to intranasal (IN) inhalation of the HCoV-OC43 solution at 104\u2013105 TCID50. This infection was lethal in 1-week-old C57BL/6 mice. However, 21 DPN mice infected this way did not show clinical signs of pathology, but 4 of the 8 animals were found positive for viral RNA by RT- PCR analyses. Viral RNA was mainly found in the CNS but some mice also showed virus RNA in the spleen (data not shown). Therefore, virus could spread from the periphery to the CNS after IN inhalation.",

The IC route results in a more reproducible infection, a better control of viral doses introduced into the brain. The correlation between viral infectious dose and 100% mortality in the two strains of mice after inoculation is shown in Table 1. Mice became less susceptible with age and were resistant at 35 DPN for C57BL/6 and at 28 DPN for BALB/c mice. We then determined the optimal experimental conditions to obtain a sublethal dose that still allowed virus replication and virus-induced CNS pathology in 21-day-old mice. Viral dose was administered under deep anesthesia and was determined to be 10 \u03bcl of a virus solution containing 10 TCID50 for C57BL/6 and 105 TCID50 for BALB/c mice aged 21 DPN. Under these conditions, inoculated mice developed signs of acute disease characterized by loss of weight, apathy, ruffled fur, humped posture, and wasting (Figs. 1A and B). Animals showed atrophy of skeletal muscles and occasionally exhibited paralysis of their forelimbs. During the second week postinfection, some of the animals recovered and clinical signs totally disappeared. For others, pathological signs increased and led to death. The infected animals became anorexic, inactive, and dehydrated, increasing percentages of mortality. We established survival curves for each mouse strain (Fig. 1C). Eighty percent of the C57BL/6 mice died within the first 15 days postinfection and only 20% of BALB/c mice died during this period, even after receiving a higher viral dose. Moreover, mice inoculated with supernatants from cell cultures infected with brain tissue from affected mice developed the same disease, demonstrating that the virus was responsible for pathology.",

Therefore, CsA doses were selected to avoid cytotoxic effects and mortality in mice and were in accordance with immunosuppression- inducing doses described in the literature Bolton et al., 1982, Pasick et al., 1992. Control mice treated with CsA at a daily dose of 20 mg/kg did not show any apparent adverse effects: they gained weight normally and did not present ruffled fur or lethargy. For CsA-treated and untreated mice, the kinetics of weight loss was similar after HCoV-OC43 infection. Nevertheless, immunosuppression by CsA slightly precipitated the disease but increased mortality (Fig. 8). This was more pronounced in mice treated with CsA at 20 mg/kg/day where 100% of mice died, whereas only 80% of oil-treated mice succumbed to HCoV-OC43 infection.",

Indeed, our results show striking susceptibility differences between two strains of mice: BALB/c mice were more resistant than C57BL/6. Moreover, resistance increased with age in the two strains of mice. This suggests that susceptibility to human coronavirus neuropathogenesis may be linked to genetic factors. Our study also confirms that human coronaviruses have neuroinvasive properties in mice, which was first shown in newborn mice (Barthold et al., 1990), and that such neuroinvasion is possible even after maturation of the immune system (King et al., 1992), which is consistent with their detection in human brain Burks et al., 1980, Murray et al., 1992, Stewart et al., 1992, Arbour et al., 2000. Even though our study does not confirm a specific route of entry into the CNS, a transneuronal route already demonstrated for MHV Lavi et al., 1988, Barthold et al., 1990, Perlman et al., 1990a constitutes a likely possibility.",

Following IC inoculation, some mice developed disseminated infection, and mortality seemed to be related to the amount of infectious virus in the CNS. Mice inoculated IN with HCoV-OC43 did not show pathological signs, despite evidence of a disseminated infection. This was also previously observed after IN inoculation with MHV-A59, which caused only very mild pathologic symptoms and mortality even with very high viral doses (Lavi et al., 1986). The clinical signs of pathology after HCoV-OC43 IC inoculation coincided with the peak in virus yields observed at approximately 5 to 9 days postinfection for C57BL/6 mice. This indicates that virus replication in the CNS apparently played a major role in the establishment of the pathology.",

            "text": "Infected mice showed extensive inflammatory responses characterized by mononuclear perivascular cuffing, neuronophagia, and a great number of reactive glial cells in the infected regions. To investigate whether infiltration of inflammatory cells contributed to neurodegeneration or if infectious virus was directly responsible for vacuolating lesions and neuronal death, we evaluated the effect of treating animals with cyclosporin A, a powerful immunosuppressant drug. With the dose used (10 or 20 mg/kg/day), CsA is known to be distributed extensively throughout the body and not to cause neurotoxicity in mice (Boland et al., 1984). Immunosuppression precipitated human coronavirus-induced disease and increased the percentage of acute death (80 vs 100%). Under CsA treatment, neurons also presented vacuolation and degeneration. Therefore, the pathology observed following HCoV- OC43 infection was likely not immunologically mediated, unlike that induced by MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM Sussman et al., 1989, Wang et al., 1990, although experiments with immunodeficient mice of the same genetic background will be needed to definitely address this question with HCoV-OC43. Moreover, macrophage/microglial reactivity was delayed when related to infection and appeared only when the virus was present in most parts of the brain. The inflammatory response and macrophage/microglial cell recruitment seem to be strongly correlated with virus clearance, as was also demonstrated after MHV infection (Sussman et al., 1989). Some strains of MHV, including A59 and JHM, are neuroinvasive in rodents, eliciting either an acute encephalitis or a chronic paralytic disease (for review, see Perlman, 1998). Unlike the slow neurodegenerative disease caused by MHV Bailey et al., 1949, Lampert et al., 1973, Weiner, 1973, Lavi et al., 1984, Wang et al., 1990, HCoV-OC43 resulted in a productive and cytotoxic infection of neuronal cells in the CNS, which led to neurodegeneration.",

Nevertheless, even though neurons were susceptible to MHV infection, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes represented the major infected cell types Perlman and Ries, 1987, Sun and Perlman, 1995, Sun et al., 1995. This may explain why the pathology observed in mice was different after infection with these two antigenically related coronaviruses: MHV can cause demyelination Bailey et al., 1949, Lampert et al., 1973, Weiner, 1973, Wang et al., 1990 with a spongy state observed in the white matter (Lavi et al., 1984), whereas HCoV-OC43 encephalitis is accompanied by vacuolating degeneration of the gray matter. The latter lesions were not detected in a previous study Pearson and Mims, 1983, Barthold et al., 1990, probably because mice were younger and died within 3 to 7 days postinfection. Spongiform cellular changes were occasionally reported after MHV infection. For example, vacuolation was observed in the subthalamic- nigral region after ic inoculation of MHV-A59 (Fishman et al., 1985), and foci of vacuolation were observed in the hypothalamus, cerebellar peduncles, and pons regions after IN inoculation of MHV-S (Barthold and Smith, 1983). Nevertheless, these degenerative changes were not commonly observed after MHV infection and were restricted to small cell populations, even after infection with 300- to 600-fold higher virus doses into C57BL/6 mice.",

Nevertheless, mitochondrial disease (McKelvie et al., 1991), Leigh's disease Kimura et al., 1991, Agapitos et al., 1997, Pick's disease (Deruaz et al., 1993), or Alzheimer's disease Duffy et al., 1988, Budka et al., 1995 also display spongiform CNS lesions, which are independent of the prion protein. Pathways and causal start points of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or acute encephalitis remain unknown. Occasionally, viral infections of the CNS were described to induce spreading spongiosis, such as in human T cell leukemia virus associated myelopathy (HTLV-1) or in HIV encephalitis Rhodes, 1987, Goldwater and Paton, 1989. In rodents, mutants of VSV virus (Rabinowitz et al., 1976) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) Gardner et al., 1973, Czub et al., 1994 were shown to experimentally induce spongiosis. Histologically, vacuolar degeneration induced by HCoV-OC43 was mainly restricted to the neuronal cell bodies, whereas that caused by prion or retrovirus first affected the neuropil. Moreover, the inflammatory response was very limited in prion encephalopathy, whereas HCoV-OC43 induced extensive brain inflammation. These indicate different mechanisms underlying vacuolation and neuronal death.",

Infections by opportunistic pathogens such as respiratory or enteric virus in immuosuppressed patients (HIV, transplantation, and cancer chemotherapy) may also cause CNS pathology. It has been reported that immunocompromised patients have increased incidences of malignancies induced by viral infection (Penn, 1987). Therefore, severe cases of encephalitis have devastating effects on the brain and spinal cord functions. Given our previous observations of HCoV-OC43 persistence in human brain Stewart et al., 1992, Arbour et al., 2000, we propose that respiratory pathogens with a neurotropic and neuroinvasive potential could be associated with neurodegenerative disease in susceptible individuals. This animal model of human coronavirus neuropathogenesis may prove helpful in the characterization of coronavirus-induced neurodegeneration in surviving infected animals and of transneuronal virus spread to the CNS. Moreover, susceptibilities of endothelial cells and leukocytes to viral infection need to be investigated as a possible alternate route of virus entry into the CNS. Finally, possible explanations for our observations of striking differences in susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection of two strains of mice remain to be investigated.",

For RT-PCR, one pair of HCoV-OC43 primers was designed to amplify a region containing 305 nucleotides (primers O1 and O3) of the gene coding for the N protein (Arbour et al., 1999b). The target sequences were specific to HCoV-OC43 and did not amplify MHV. The suitability of RNA for RT-PCR amplification was verified by an RT-PCR specific for a housekeeping gene encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) using a pair of GAPDH primers amplifying a region containing 833 nucleotides (Arbour et al., 1999b). One pair of MHV primers was also designed to amplify a conserved region of the MHV N protein gene. Primers were 5\u2032-CCTCTACTGTAAAACCTGATATGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTAATTTAGATCCAAAGAAGAAGC-3\u2032, corresponding to nucleotides 677\u2013700 and 868\u2013991, respectively.
