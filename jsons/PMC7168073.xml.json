While most clinically apparent cases in Malaysia were found in patients with direct exposure to infected pigs,\n13\n seroconversions and subclinical brain lesions were documented in exposed health care workers, demonstrating that human\u2010to\u2010human transmission of the virus is possible.\n14\n Indeed, there is stronger evidence of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission in the recent Bangladesh outbreaks.\n11\n, \n15\n NiV is a BSL\u20104 pathogen and is designated a Category C priority pathogen in the NIAID Biodefense Research Agenda.",

In addition to causing acute disease, 3\u20137% of infected patients exhibit a late onset or relapsed encephalitis months to years after the initial infection,\n14\n, \n17\n, \n18\n thereby increasing the risk of community exposure. This is particularly worrisome given that there is increasing evidence of human\u2010to\u2010human transmissions in the most recent outbreaks.\n11\n NiV can be grown to high titers in vitro (>10\n8\n IU/mL without concentration),\n14\n and thus, it has been suggested it can be weaponized as an aerosol.\n16\n In addition, NiV may be a more devastating agent of economic or agrobioterrorism when used against the pig farming industry. During the NiV outbreak in Malaysia, which affected 265 individuals, more than 1 million pigs were culled, resulting in economic losses that totaled far more than their export value of US$100 million.\n16\n In the United States, the total annual production value of hogs and pigs in 2002 exceeded $8 billion, with farms in just three states (Iowa, Minnesota, and North Carolina) accounting for 50% of the value .\n19\n If Nipah\u2010like agents were to be intentionally released in any one of these three states, the economic devastation from the loss of production alone could easily be more than $1 billion. This is not an unrealistic scenario; while the mortality rate in pigs (\u223c5%) is lower than in humans, the morbidity and transmission rate approaches 100%.\n2\n, \n20\n The observation that seroconversions and MRI\u2010detectable brain lesions have been documented in exposed health care workers,\n21\n and in military personnel involved in the Malaysian culling operation, and that 30% of seroconverters went on to develop encephalitic sequelae,\n22\n further underscores the need to understand the pathogenesis of this disease.",

            "text": "Based on their findings, the authors suggested a temporal mode of events. Upon infection, primary replication of the virus occurs in lymphoid tissues (acute lymphoid necrosis), which leads to viremia and secondary replication in endothelial cells. Subsequent syncytia formation is the sentinel pathogenic event that leads to vasculitis, thrombosis, and necrosis and infection of parenchymal cells in various tissues. However, even though NiV antigen can be found in the microvasculature of many tissues, the highest antigen load is found in the brain parenchyma, especially in neurons. Thus, neuronal and endothelial cell tropism is an established hallmark of NiV. The recent discovery of ephrinB2 as the receptor for NiV entry (see below) is remarkably consistent with the known tropism of NiV, as ephrinB2 is critically involved in neurogenesis and angiogenesis, and is highly expressed in neurons and endothelial cells. Ephrin genes are highly conserved, and have been found in all animal species examined.\n36\n Thus, the conservation of ephrinB2 may also explain the unusually broad tropism of NiV. EphrinBs bind to a large family of ephB receptor tyrosine kinases. It is the cognate bidirectional signaling that occurs during ephrinB\u2013ephB interactions that direct the migration of endothelial cells and neuronal dendrites.\n36\n, \n37\n, \n38\n, \n39\n, \n40\n The interference with these interactions by NiV\u2010G or HeV\u2010G may also have great relevance for the pathogenicity of the virus.",

However, these initial experiments did identify several cell lines that were nonpermissive for viral fusion. In separate experiments, using a viral overlay technique to identify candidate proteins that may bind to NiV envelope glycoproteins, this group identified a protein candidate around 50 kDa that was bound specifically by viral particles in their viral overlay assay.\n43\n Then, using microarray analyses to compare a series of permissive and nonpermissive cell lines, Border and colleagues narrowed down a candidate list of putative receptors that fit several criteria (protein size, predicted membrane protein, highly expressed in permissive but not nonpermissive cell lines). Each of these candidate genes was then transfected into a nonpermissive cell line and tested for its ability to confer fusion permissivity by NiV envelope glycoproteins. Only one of the genes, ephrinB2, was able to confer fusion permissivity. EphrinB2 was subsequently confirmed to be a bonafide receptor in their hands as it enabled live NiV entry into otherwise nonpermissive cell lines.\n44\n\n",

This was a necessary technique as paramyxoviral envelope genes are generally not expressed well from standard RNA Pol II\u2010dependent promoters, at least not at levels required for substantive biochemical studies. Indeed, a large number of studies on paramyxoviral envelopes had relied on vaccinia\u2010driven envelope expression. Thus, our studies on the properties of the Nipah envelope proteins can be performed under a less confounding experimental setting, as it has been noted that the use of vaccinia vectors in studies of paramyxovirus fusion necessitates the consideration of vaccinia structural proteins as a confounding factor,\n45\n although to our knowledge, reports of actual vaccinia\u2010related confounding factors have not been reported. Our codon\u2010optimized immunoadhesin (NiV\u2010G\u2010Fc) had cell \u2013line\u2010binding properties that recapitulated the published cell line tropism of NiV. Preparative immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometric analyses (LC\u2010tandem MS/MS) leads to the identification of ephrinB2 as the protein that was specifically bound by the attachment protein of NiV (NiV\u2010G). Several lines of evidence were used to show that ephrinB2 was the receptor for NiV entry: (1) soluble NiV\u2010G binding to a variety of permissive cells was inhibited by soluble ephrinB2 and a variety of soluble ephB receptors, which are cognate endogenous receptors that bind ephrinB2; (2) transfection of ephrinB2 into a variety of nonpermissive cell lines made them permissive for NiV envelope\u2010mediated fusion and entry; and (3) NiV envelope\u2010mediated viral entry into endothelial cells and neurons, two primary cell types known to be infected by NiV in vivo, were inhibited by soluble ephrinB2.\n31\n Significantly, this latter point provided strong evidence that ephrinB2 is likely the bonafide cellular receptor used by NiV in vivo.",

If NiV\u2010G acts like ephB4 and binds to ephrinB2, but lacks reverse signaling, perhaps only forward propulsion will ensue. We speculate that this might act to recruit more endothelial cells to areas of NiV replication. Indeed, signaling\u2010deficient ephB4 on tumor cells can promote invasion by ephrinB2\u2010expressing endothelial cells.\n51\n It will be interesting to reexamine pathological specimens for increased angiogenesis in areas of NiV replication. It is also possible that PDZ domain containing proteins and other signaling proteins known to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of ephrinB2 may also play a role in the productive entry of NiV. For example, it has been proposed that PDZ domain containing proteins may bind the cytoplasmic domain of Eph receptor and ephrinB ligands, and stabilize higher\u2010ordered clustering of these receptor ligand pairs into oligomeric arrays.\n52\n The density of this clustering may modulate the nature and intensity of the forward and reverse signaling.\n52\n It is known that both HeV\u2010G and NiV\u2010G are tetrameric,\n32\n, \n53\n like the proposed quaternary structures of ephB receptors.

Since the critical residues in ephrinB2 involved in interactions with NiV\u2010G are the same as those required for interaction with the ephB2 receptor,\n33\n it is likely that NiV\u2010G will indeed induce reverse signaling via ephrinB2.

However, due to the extraordinarily high affinity of NiV\u2010G for ephrinB2 (Kd\u223c0.06 nM), the affinity of ephrinB3 was still in the subnanomolar range (Kd\u223c0.6 nM), which may explain why ephrinB3\u2010mediated entry remains readily detectable.\n33\n In addition, we also pinpointed two key residues common to ephrinB2 and ephrinB3 that mediate their use as receptors for NiV entry. Significantly, these two residues were also critical for their activity as ligands for the endogenous ephB2 receptor (recall that ephrinB ligands bind to ephB receptors). We suggested that ephrinB3 is a relevant receptor for NiV in vivo, as MRI lesions in NiV\u2010infected patients can be found in specific regions of the CNS (such as the corpus callosum and the spinal cord)\n72\n, \n73\n that are known only to express ephrinB3, but not ephrinB2.\n74\n, \n75\n Thus, ephrinB3 may serve as a receptor for NiV entry into certain neuronal subsets.",

Additional support that ephrinB3 is not expressed in endothelium comes from our observation that ephB4, which only binds ephrinB2, can completely inhibit NiV entry into microvascular endothelial cells.\n31\n Thus, if ephrinB3 is used as an alternate receptor by NiV and/or HeV, the efficiency by which NiV or HeV uses ephrinB2 versus ephrinB3 could contribute to their differential pathologies. Indeed, since NiV appears to have an increased encephalogenic potential compared to HeV, we speculate that NiV may use ephrinB3 better than HeV, as certain neuronal subsets express both ephrinB2 and ephrinB3 while microvascular endothelial cells only express ephrinB2.

We found that gal\u20101 can potently inhibit NiVF/G\u2010mediated cell\u2013cell fusion in a manner that was dependent on its native homodimeric form, and also dependent on its glycan\u2010binding properties.\n32\n Importantly, we also determined that gal\u20101 specifically binds NiV\u2010F and \u2010G and indeed, pinpointed an N\u2010linked glycosylation site on NiV\u2010F that is preferentially bound by gal\u20101: mutation of that N\u2010linked glycosylation site renders the mutant NiV\u2010F significantly more resistant to gal\u20101\u2010mediated inhibition. This gal\u20101\u2010mediated inhibition appears to be relatively specific as gal\u20101 also inhibited HeV\u2010mediated fusion, but not a variety of other viruses tested.\n32\n Indeed, gal\u20101 has been recently shown to enhance HIV\u20101 infection.\n82\n Thus, gal\u20101 does not appear to have a ubiquitous antiviral effect, unlike cyanovirin, another lectin that has been shown to inhibit a variety of viruses via steric hindrance mechanisms as a result of binding high\u2010mannose glycans present on their envelope glycoproteins.\n83\n, \n84\n The exact mechanism by which gal\u20101 inhibits NiV fusion remains to be determined, but since gal\u20101 can aberrantly oligomerize both NiV\u2010F and G,\n32\n it is not unreasonable to propose that these aberrant oligomers compromise the ability of the F and G complex to undergo the conformational changes required for membrane fusion.",

It is difficult to answer this teleological question, but perhaps one could also argue that NiV infection would be even more lethal in the absence of endogenous gal\u20101. In addition, natural polymorphisms in the gal\u20101 gene, some of which can be predicted to affect the glycan\u2010binding properties of gal\u20101, may contribute to the variant mortality rates found between the various NiV outbreaks. However, the frequency of these polymorphisms in the affected populations is not known. In addition, it is also not known what the variance of gal\u20101 levels is in the general population. Perhaps a threshold level of gal\u20101 is required for its putative protective effect, and these levels are not present in individuals who succumb to the more severe effects of the Nipah viral infection. Indeed, these questions underscore the need to further understand the potential role that innate immune defense mechanisms may play against emerging pathogens.",
