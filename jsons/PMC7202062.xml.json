Representative karyotypes of I. montanus are shown in Fig. 2. C\u2010banding (Fig. 2h) shows small centromeric C\u2010bands on all the chromosomes. Observed diploid chromosome numbers range from 29+XX (\u2640), X0 (\u2642) (Corconte, Fig. 2c) to 34+XX/X0 (La Salceda, Fig. 2a). The variation in numbers is seen to result from fusion of autosomes. The variation in chromosome numbers required the development of a method to which allowed accurate analysis of the fusion events. The specimen with the highest number of chromosomes was used as a basis for establishing the karyotype, as this number of chromosomes matches those shown by related species (see introduction). The only specimen with the full number of chromosomes came from La Salceda in Spain (Fig. 2a), so this was taken as a reference specimen and other karyotypes were assessed by comparison with it. Three different fusion events were recognised, involving autosomes 3 and 15 (3/15), 4 and 14 (4/14) and 7 and 13 (7/13). In karyotypes involving chromosomal fusions, fused chromosomes were placed in the position of the longer of the two chromosomes involved in the fusion.",

This was in many cases supported by other nuances, especially hints of chromomere banding and minor details of the disposition of the chromosome arms. These apparently incidental features, frequently visible in preparations from gut cells, but rare in testis, cannot be controlled, as, for instance can G\u2010banding in mammal chromosomes, but they tend to be consistent, especially between homologous chromosomes within a single karyotype (e.g. 2, 3). Fusion 3/15 (Fig. 3) involves a long almost metacentric chromosome (3) and a short submetacentric chromosome (15). The centromere of chromosome 3 remains, but that of 15 is lost, and the fusion is between the ends of the shorter arm of chromosome 3 (identified by its chromomeres) and the long arm of chromosome 15. The only karyotypes heterozygous for this fusion that were obtained are from testis (e.g. Fig. 2j), but the chromomeres of the fused and unfused chromosomes shown in Fig. 3a\u2013d support this interpretation.",

Figure !4!6b shows this clearly, with the positions of the terminalised chiasmata indicated by arrows. The other chromosomes show normal bivalent pairing, except for the unpaired X\u2010chromosome. The apparently uneven, possibly heteromorphic bivalent lying just below the X\u2010chromosome appears to be a consistent feature of I. montanus meiosis. Figure !4!6c shows a C\u2010banded preparation from the same specimen. This is at a slightly earlier stage and the chromosomes of the trivalent are lying side by side. The centromere of unfused chromosome 13 cannot be detected. Fig. 2j shows a karyotype heterozygous for fusions 3/15 and 7/13. Figure !4!6d shows an unbanded first metaphase of meiosis from this specimen, while Fig. !4!6e shows a C\u2010banded first metaphase. The trivalent formed by chromosomes 3 and 15 is ring shaped, apparently an arrangement left from the linear pairing of the chromosomes during prophase. In the unbanded preparation (Fig. !4!6d) a gap (indicated by a broken line) can be seen in the middle of the right hand side of the ring. In the C\u2010banded preparation (Fig. !4!6e) the gap is on the left side of the ring, and the three centromeres can be seen. Chiasmata are indicated by arrows.

The frequencies of the other fusion events showed no departure from the Hardy\u2010Weinberg equilibrium. Differences in the frequencies of each fusion event between the populations also showed that Woolmer differs from the other two localities with respect to fusion 3/15 (\u03c72=19.47, 5 df, p=0.0016), but that there were no other differences.",

If, as is suggested by Fery and Nilsson (1993) this chromosomal arrangement is a synapomorphy, then it suggests a close relationship between those species having it. The karyotype of I. wasastjernae may represent an intermediate arrangement between that found in Agabus and that found in the other Ilybius species. This would be consistent with the basal position of the I. Opacus species group (which includees I. Wasastjernae) within the Ilybius clade in the mitochondrial DNA analysis reported by Ribera et al. (2004). Information on the karyotypes of other species of the I. opacus group (which includes I. wasastjernae) would be interesting in this context. The Ilybius species with karyotypes having 34 autosomes show some interspecific differences in the relative lengths of the chromosomes, as well as in centromere position, but these are not great. The inversion polymorphism shown by autosome 15 of I. chalconatus is noteworthy, and it would be helpful to find material heterozygous for this character. The karyotype of I. montanus sometimes conforms to the same pattern as the other species, but shows an exceptional variation in chromosome number. This variation is caused by fusion between chromosomes and is continuous in that all chromosome events show all possible variations, homozygous unfused, heterozygous and homozygous fused. There is thus no evidence that the differences in chromosome number are leading to speciation. This is supported by the morphology of the beetle, which does not show any signs of variation suggestive of speciation. Analysis of meiotic cells shows an apparently normal sequence of events, and testes of individuals heterozygous for fusions show normal spermatogenesis with no trace of degenerating cells, which might follow from failed meiosis. Thus the beetles do not show any evidence of reduced fertility, despite the chromosomal variation. Heterozygosity for chromosomal fusions and the consequent formation of trivalents at first division of meiosis, might have been expected to disrupt meiosis or to result in the production of aneuploid cells. However, we have been unable to find any evidence of this. The most likely explanation for this is that in the trivalents the positions of the chiasmata are such that separation during first anaphase, each chromosome always has one centromere: there are no acentrics or dicentrics. Thus chiasmata must be either in the longer of the chromosomes involved in the fusions, or distal to the centromere of the short chromosome when aligned for pairing \u2013 i.e. in its short arm. There must also be some mechanism by which a fused chromosome goes to one pole while its unfused counterparts both go to the other one.",

There is no evidence for the variation to have originated from a single site. Study of specimens from 3 different localities in England, shows that the fusion events do not deviate from the Hardy\u2010Weinberg equilibrium, except for one fusion event within one locality. Fusion 3/15 from Woolmer has fewer heterozygous individuals than expected. Whether this suggests that the population at Woolmer is being selected for homozygous fused or unfused individuals is not clear.",
