            "text": "The genus Coronavirus (CoVs) belong to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae and subfamily Coronavirinae. Recently, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses has proposed three genera: including the mammalian genera Alpha- and Beta- and the bird-associated genera Gamma- and Detacoronavirus recently [[1], [2], [3]], to replace the traditional CoV groups 1, 2, and 3 [4,5]. CoVs are a diverse group of enveloped, plus-stranded RNA viruses that infect humans and many animal species, in which they can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, central nervous system and neurological diseases of varying severity [3]. In 2003, a novel aggressive human coronavirus termed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which is most related to genus Betacoronavirus, caused a large epidemic with a case fatality rate of \u223c10%, creating a global panic and economic damage [6]. In 2012, the newly emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a highly pathogenic virus with an approximately 50% fatality rate, can cause a serious respiratory manifestations, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [7,8]. To date, it has been shown that four other human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HKU1 [[9], [10], [11]], cause a significant portion of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in humans, including common colds, bronchiolitis and neurological disease [12]. To date, no medication is available to effectively prevent or cure HCoV-229E-related diseases. Thus, it is important to design and develop new vaccines or drugs that are specific for the HCoV-229E-related diseases.",

            "text": "CoVs are enveloped virus, suggesting that the fusion between the cell membrane and the viral envelope is essential for the initiation of viral invasion. Following binding with host receptor, CoVs release viral genetic materials into the cytoplasm through direct membrane fusion [13,14]. Membrane fusion is mediated by spike protein S2 subunit. This subunit is expected to present rearrangement of its characteristic elements called heptad repeats (HRs) to form a stable 6-helix bundle fusion core [14]. Although great advances in the knowledge of CoVs protein and host factors have been achieved, no licensed vaccines or specific drugs are available to prevent CoVs infection [15]. In view of prevalence of epidemics due to CoVs, it is essential to develop novel broad-spectrum antivirus drugs. Since fusion with the host membrane is a vital early step in the life cycle of the virus, fusion inhibitors could be designed as antiviral drugs. Such as Human immunodeficiency virus I inhibitor T20, a peptide mimic of HR2 and acting through competitively binding to HR1, is the first fusion inhibitor targeting membrane fusion [16,17].",

Little if any experimental evidence has been presented to propose that the HCoV-229E fusion core shares the same features. In order to unravel the structure basis of HCoV-229E membrane fusion, we solved the structure of fusion core of HCoV-229E and characterized the binding of HR1s and HR2s via both sequence alignment and structural analysis. The overall structures shows that the HR1 and HR2 polypeptides are highly complementary in both shape and chemical properties. Although HCoV-229E fusion core presenting the highly conserved sequences copmare with MHV, SARS, MERS, and NL-63, the HR2 have some differences in stereo configuration. Furthermore, the available knowledge concerning HCoV-229E fusion core may provide inportant details for the design of small molecule or polypeptide drugs that target HCoV-229E infection.",

In view of the prediction of the LearnCoil-VMF program and the multiple alignments of the putative heptad repeat regions of HCoV-229E with those of several other coronaviruses, the final construct of the HCoV-229E fusion core was designed. The fusion core consists of HR1, a truncated type of the LearnCoil-VMF predicted HR1 (residues 786\u2013853), connected with HR2, an extended version of the LearnCoil-VMF predicted HR2 (1051\u20131102) (Fig. 1a) and a flexible 22-residue linker (LVPRGSGGSGGSGGLEVLFQGP). This flexible linker has been shown to work successfully with the fusion core of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that allows for easy expression and purification of the fusion core complex [19,30]. The recombinant protein, designated fusion core (FC1), was expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. FC1 was eluted at approximately 15.8 ml on a calibrated Superdex 200 10/300 column, corresponding to a molecular mass of \u223c45 kDa. AUC was also used to investigate the molecular mass Fig. 1b which gave a value of 49.7 kDa. As the single HR1-linker-HR2 chain is \u223c15.4 kDa, these data indicate a trimer has formed in solution, as expected. We further tested the protein by CD spectroscopy. Double minima at 208 and 222 nm were observed, demonstrating that the FC1 has a high alpha-helical content (Fig. 1c). The fusion core designed here shared the feature of the helix wheels (Fig. 1d), a typical characteristic of class I fusion protein [19].",

Instead, cross-sectional layers containing an \u201cx-like\u201d symmetric pattern (Fig. 2e) [31] alternate with layers containing a da-like two-residue pattern (\u201cy-like\u201dpacking; see Fig. 2f) [32].

As described above, all of the residues at a/d position of HR2 are highly conserved (either Leu and Ile). Their presence is essential to form an interface of strong hydrophobicity. In addition, e/g positions of HR1 are also conserved. Thus, the overall structures and the hydrophobic character of the interaction between HR1 and HR2 is conserved in both fusion cores, suggesting the possibility for broad-spectrum inhibitor design targeting fusion core proteins of all CoVs.",
