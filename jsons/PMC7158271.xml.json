The reasons include\u2022an increasing evidence that wastewater quality in high and low economic areas is different regarding some parameters that determine treatment options and\u2022differences in economic conditions necessitate alternative solutions not only at the technical level but also in terms of the ways to implement them.\n",

While in developed countries, sanitation coverage is almost 99% as a result of a clear commitment of governments to provide it as part of the public services, in developing ones it is only around 50% (WHO\u2013UNICEF, 2006). In addition, in the developed countries, the term sanitation applies not only to the installation of sewers but also to the full implementation of systems for the safe disposal and reuse of treated wastewater, sludge, and septage. In contrast, in developing countries, the term sanitation mostly applies to the use of sewers not always ending in treatment plants. In fact, reported sanitation figures frequently do not reveal the disposal of wastewater or excreta uncontrolled into the environment, the existence of malfunctioning wastewater treatment plants, or the use of rudimentary and inefficient basic sanitation facilities sometimes contributing to increased environmental pollution rather than to control it. As a result, waterborne diseases affect millions of people in the developing world, and the water quality of surface and groundwater bodies is increasingly deteriorating.",

Most technical publications have traditionally grouped developing countries together as low-income societies without considering that in them there are high- and low-income areas and that among the latter ones there are several factors that create differences that need to be taken into consideration to provide suitable solutions, that rarely fall under the logic used in developed countries to provide sanitation. Most people lacking sanitation include the millions of poor people (Figure 1\n) living under precarious institutional conditions and under an economical and social situation that avoids the use of conventional solutions. This renders the provision of sanitation in low-income areas a major challenge.",

As sanitation is a broken subject in developing countries, the story of these three is also the same. When mankind was nomadic and lived in very small communities, sanitation was not an issue. Nature could absorb human wastes. Later, when villages grew, there was the need to set up special practices and facilities. In ancient Egypt (\u223c3000 BC), each household had the responsibility to dispose of their garbage and excreta at the communal dump, in irrigation canals, or in open fields. Irrigation canals were the first drainage and waste disposal systems. At that time, toilets were a luxury that only the wealthier people could afford in cities. Toilets were carved of limestone, and the used water was disposed of into pits in the streets (MSU, 2009). Flushing toilets \u2013 some of them communal \u2013 existed in India since the twenty-sixth century BC. Reports on the use of toilets and other safe sanitation practices in ancient civilizations from Asia, Latin America, and Africa were common in places where nowadays lack of sanitation is a problem.",

Initially, it was an open drain that was covered and left below the urban level, as the city building space became costly (Wikipedia, 2009). Later, when water began to be supplied in large quantities to households, getting rid of the used water became a problem and water was considered as a waste. It was then when sewers were found to be a useful infrastructure to convey wastewater out of the city in addition to stormwater.",

They are considered to be point sources of pollution where they are produced and collected in sewers and thus disposed of as a well-identified source. When not treated, the main environmental concerns relate to conventional pollutants, such as biological, biodegradable, and nonbiodegradable organic matter, and heavy metals, in that order of importance. The content of almost all these of pollutants is similar around the world, tending to be more concentrated in arid and semiarid areas because of lack of water. In some cases, higher concentrations of pollutants result from increased industrialization of cities. Unfortunately, even when treated, municipal discharges introduce used water containing used compounds, some of which are pollutants, to water bodies. Municipal wastewater is never treated to recover its original quality (the one it had at the water source) as the self-cleansing and dilution capability of nature is used to complete the task. This is confirmed by the increasing amount of trace pollutants, such as endocrine disrupters, found in water sources. The presence of these compounds might be considered as an indicator that we have surpassed the natural depollution capability of the environment. Despite this, the idea of using water bodies or soil to depollute wastewater is still very common, and it could be reduced in water bodies as the depollution capability is lost as result of the water temperature increase due to climate change. In developing countries, the environment is frequently used to depollute wastewater, included when not treated at all, explaining the low quality of water bodies and the widespread presence of diarrheic diseases.",

A list of the most common pollutants in industrial discharges can be found in Jim\u00e9nez (2009a). Due to the difficultly in tracking toxic compounds and their fate, combined with the need to use complex and costly treatment methods to remove them from wastewater, it is advisable and cost effective to consider the implementation of cleaner production methods in industries (such as the replacement of toxic recalcitrant compounds with others that are less harmful or not harmful at all) and, also to raise awareness of society to reduce the use of such types of compounds (Jim\u00e9nez, 2009b).",

Globally, there are around 1\u20132 thousand million people suffering of helminthiases but most of them are from developing countries where it affects up to 10% of the population. The incidence rate may reach 90% in regions where poverty and poor sanitary conditions prevail. In contrast, in developed countries, helminthiases\u2019 incidence is at the most 1.5% and affects mainly poor immigrants (Jim\u00e9nez, 2008a). Helminthiases have different manifestations but, in general, they cause intestinal wall damage, hemorrhages, deficient blood coagulation, and undernourishment. They can degenerate into cancer tumors. Helminthiases affect mainly children, the elderly, and poor people (Jim\u00e9nez, 2008). Around 94% of the more than 4 billion cases of diarrhea in the world are caused by helminths (Murray and L\u00f3pez, 1996). There are several kinds of helminths with different local names (Annex 2\n). This along with the fact that it is hard to properly identify them clinically unless a costly laboratory analysis is performed, makes it difficult to track the actual incidence of all the helminthiases. That is why frequently figures are underestimated. Technically, helminthiases take their name from their causative agent. For instance, trichuriasis is named after Thrichuris. Ascariasis, affecting nearly 1500 million people, is the most common of the helminthiases and is endemic in Africa, Latin America, and the Far East. Even though the mortality rate is low, most of the people infected are children under 15 years of age with problems of faltering growth and/or decreased physical fitness. Around 1.5 million of these children will probably never bridge the growth deficit, even if treated (Silva et al., 1997; Jim\u00e9nez, 2008a).",

They derive from many sources including pesticides, persistent organic pollutants, nonionic detergents, and human pharmaceutical residues. Some of them have been identified in municipal wastewater and many of them may persist in the environment for some time. Endocrine disruptors have been also found in drinking water. Their presence in recycled waters also raises broader questions about the risks and benefits of water recycling and our approaches to anticipating the emergence of new contaminants.Human health effects potentially linked to exposure to these chemicals include breast, prostate, and testicular cancer; diminished semen quantity and quality, and impaired behavioral, immune or thyroid functions in children. Although direct evidence of adverse health effects in humans is lacking, reproductive abnormalities, altered immune function, and population disruption potentially linked to exposure to these substances has been observed in amphibians, birds, fish, invertebrates, mammals, and reptiles.

Thus, it has to do with excreta management rather than with sewerage and wastewater treatment plants (Box 4\nand Figure 7\n). The quality of the service is frequently associated with peoples\u2019 economic level, and thus, is also a sign of status. Another aspect to consider is that the lack of basic sanitation frequently is associated with lack of water. LeBlanc et al. (2008) highlights that research and experience suggest the following hierarchy of risk to human health:\u201cliving in a dense community without basic sanitation>(is more risky than\u2026) irrigation of crops with untreated, pathogen-contaminated wastewater>use of untreated, pathogen-contaminated excreta or wastewater sludge on soils>use of untreated, pathogen-contaminated animal manures on soils>use of treated manures, wastewater, or biosolids on crops>use of these treated materials in accordance with strict modern regulations that address heavy metal and chemical contaminants.\u201d\nBox 4Some challenges to provide basic sanitation in low-income countries\n\u2022Open defecation is practiced by 48% of the population in Southern Asia and 28% in sub-Saharan Africa.\u2022In Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, the access to sanitation facilities is 53% while the figure for the country is 15.6%, a figure that reduces to only 10% for rural areas (Paskalev, 2008).\u2022In Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon's capital with 2 000 000 inhabitants, the available facilities for most people (88%) are external and in shared proprieties (Figure 7).\u2022Basic sanitation and sanitation figures reported are not the same. For instance, for Cote d\u2019Ivoire, a coverage of 45% is reported for rural areas, but, in fact, 36% refers to basic facilities and only 9% to adequate systems (Angoua, 2008).\n",

Possibly, one of the aspects that contributes the most to render sanitation in developing countries a challenge is the variety of needs and circumstances arising from social differences. As shown in Figure 8\n, for instance, poor people not only are less served but also the quality of the services is lower. One of the deepest disparities is between urban and rural areas as for the former the coverage is twice as much than for the latter in developing countries. Traceable differences in sanitation services have been reported as well among indigenous and nonindigenous people and minorities such as castes and women (Box 5\n). Among these differences, the following common challenges can be identified:\u2022The need to provide the service in poor areas with large population increases.\u2022For urban areas, a very fast service demand growth in slums that are spread out in cities, have high population density, and there is no land to place the infrastructure.\u2022For rural areas, the need to assist a population frequently dispersed and hence at higher cost.\u2022The need to fund projects combining liquid and solid waste collection and treatment infrastructure.\u2022The need to develop new or different management structures to provide services in social and political complex areas.\u2022The need to include health education and awareness programs on sanitation projects.\u2022The need to use public funding to provide services that are to be subsided.\u2022The existence of regions having high income where services can be provided in a similar way to developed countries.\nBox 5Women and sanitation (with information from Lenghton L, Wright A, and Davis K (eds.) (2005) Health, Dignity and Development: What Will It Take? Millennium Development Goals. London: Earthscan.)One explanation for the low effective demand for sanitation is gender inequality. Women tend to place a higher value on household toilets than do men for a number of reasons, among them privacy, cultural norms, care-giving responsibilities, and the risk of sexual harassment and assault. In addition, the unique sanitation needs of women and girls (e.g., during menstruation and during and after pregnancy) receive little recognition when discussions about sanitation and hygiene occur. Yet, the limited political and personal power of women in many developing countries means that some of sanitation's strongest advocates are virtually absent from decision making and priority-setting processes.",

In Latin-America, for instance, although the sanitation coverage was 78% in 2006, only 18% of the wastewater was treated (CONAGUA and WWF, 2006). To give an idea of the situation in other regions, for the year 2004, when the Latin America and the Caribbean region reported a treatment capacity of 14%, this was of the order of 35% for Asia and nearly 0% for sub-Saharan Africa (WHO/UNICEF, 2000; Figure 9\n).",

They are built where a constant water supply is available and are used to partially treat domestic wastewater and to digest the settled sludge. They remove around 50% of the organic matter and suspended solid content in 2\u20134 days. For sludge digestion, 0.5\u20131 year is required; during this time, sludge is mineralized and its volume is reduced. Septic tanks are made up of a series of communicating chambers. They must be water sealed to avoid underground infiltration and are built using bricks, mortar, or concrete. A variation of the septic tank is the Imhoff tank, having the advantage of a shape that allows the removal of suspended solids and the control of foul odors in a better manner. Septic tanks need to be periodically cleaned (1\u20132 times per year, leaving 20% of the mature sludge as inoculum for digestion). This represents an additional cost that cannot always be afforded by poor people. Septage (the slurry taken out of septic tanks) is sent to wastewater treatment plants or treated separately. To treat septage, lime is frequently added until a pH of 12 is reached, over a period of 30 min (Jim\u00e9nez and Wang, 2006). Effluents from septic tanks are discharged into trenches for subsoil infiltration or diverted to the sewerage system (when available). Septic tanks are widespread sanitation systems but are often responsible for environmental pollution due to poor purification effects and leakages notably affecting groundwater.",

When the second vault is full, the first vault is emptied and so on. The urine is diverted to a soakaway. In comparison to VIP latrines, they have a lower cost associated with emptying the pits (Snyman, 2008). Urine is collected in small cans (10\u201320 l) and can be used to enrich the soil after a stabilization period of 30 days. Feces are treated using an aerobic composting process. To control odors and to assist in the mineralization of feces, materials, such as ashes or pieces of wood, are used daily to raise the pH. The pathogens in fecal matter are inactivated over time through the drying process so they can be safely removed by the owner at no cost to the municipality.

The main reasons are that they are cost-effective and, since the rural community is accustomed to the use of manure, the UD toilet is socially acceptable. However, its use in periurban areas is more problematic. The emptying of the vaults requires large-scale programs for which small businesses can contribute to the emptying of tanks (from UD or VIPs) either manually, using appropriate safety equipment, or by the use of a tanker. The disposal of the fecal matter in periurban areas is challenging due to the lack of land. If space allows, fecal sludge is buried on-site. Where this is not feasible, the sludge is blended into the waterborne system. This frequently leads to the complete overloading of the wastewater treatment plant (Snyman, 2008).

The system works via a manual flush, where 2\u20133 l of water are poured into the toilet. The water, urine, and excreta are collected in an anaerobic chamber, which works similarly to a septic tank. The chamber needs to be periodically emptied and the partially treated wastewater needs to be disposed of, normally to land (Hughes et al., 2006). In the context of water-scarce areas, a very interesting option is combining graywater reuse with basic sanitation using pour-flush toilets. This concept was developed by United Nations International Children's Emergency fund (UNICEF) on a system called the Wise Water Management scheme (Godfrey et al., 2007). This system was conceived to provide both water supply and sanitation services for water-scarce areas and can be used for both rural and low-income urban areas. It was conceived in Madhya Pradesh, India, a densely populated and poor area. The WWMS uses groundwater as the primary source of water and also includes rainwater harvesting, used to dilute groundwater when polluted with fluoride to reduce its content for human consumption (Figure 10\n). First-use water is employed for cooking, handwashing, and bathing. Water from these two activities is recovered and properly treated in a sand filter to be used for toilet flushing and kitchen garden irrigation. The graywater reuse system can be installed independently of the rainwater harvesting system. By matching water demands, in quantity and quality, to different conventional and nonconventional water sources, the WWMS increases water availability by nearly 60%. Sanitation using low-consumption reused water flush toilets has proven sustainable under the prevailing local conditions and has eradicated open defecation.",

Frequently, to reduce costs, cheap materials and the users are employed to build the facilities. However, this may result in failures, as cheap material frequently means low quality and the users are not people experienced enough, even if trained. It is thus preferable to invest in good and durable material and to use experienced workers. In India, for instance, sanitation programs using professional well-trained masons are being implemented in which the same masons for whom sanitation is a source of income become at the same time sanitation promoters.",

The investment cost for low-volume toilets is comparable to high-volume toilets. However, dual flush toilets may cost more than common ones (nearly double). The installation of water-saving toilets must be stimulated by education (e.g., in the form of campaigns to raise awareness concerning water-saving issues), water metering, and pricing.

The cost ranges from low investment for simple dry toilets to comparatively high cost for industrialized composting toilets. Due to the large size of the storage and composting chambers, these toilets require a large space underneath; if this is not possible, then they need to be regularly emptied and feces need to be transported to treatment facilities.

According to Kon\u00e9 (2010) 30\u201350% of the on-site sanitation facilities from West African countries are emptied manually.

The life expectancy of such sewers is in the order of 20 years rather than the 30 years quoted for conventional sewers. Such sewers are short and shallow (Hughes et al., 2006). One example of simplified sewers are condominial ones in which pipelines are laid through housing lots instead of on the side street, in a way that allows isolated and stepwise construction (UNEP, 2002). Condominial sewers were developed in the 1980s in Brazil with the aim of extending sanitation services to low-income communities. This technology has now become a standard sanitation solution for some urban areas in Brazil, irrespective of income levels. Condominial sewers reduce the per capita costs of service by replacing the traditional model of individual household connections to a public sewer with a model in which household waste is discharged into branch sewers, and eventually into a public sewer through a group (or block) connection (Watson, 1999 cited in Lenghton et al., 2005).",

Sewers in tropical areas produce a high amount of sediments to be disposed off, which turns out to be a peculiar and difficult-to-solve problem not frequently commented upon in specialized literature but that needs proper methods to extract sludge and handle it. In addition, when conveyed in sewerage systems, stormwater must be treated in treatment plants at the same time as wastewater; but, if transported separately, it can be discharged to surface water or into wells for groundwater infiltration receiving treatment in soil. In this case, it must be kept in mind that stormwater quantity and quality are determined by rainfall, catchment processes, and human activities, which cause its flow and composition to vary in space and time.

Lagoons are made through the shallow excavation of around 1\u20132 m, and they are frequently unlined to reduce investment costs. After a period of time, soil percolation and sedimentation form an impermeable barrier. If the water table is very high at the site, ponds need to be impermeable from the beginning. WSPs remove up to 6 bacteria log, up to 5 viruses log, and almost all the protozoa and helminth ova. To control Cryptosporidium spp., almost 38 days\u2019 retention time is needed (Jim\u00e9nez, 2008).",

Nutrients are also removed by plant uptake and pathogens by competition and sun UV-light inactivation (Jim\u00e9nez, 2003). Wetlands are shallow ponds where aquatic macrophytes are planted in soil, sand, or gravel. There are three main types: surface-flow, horizontal-flow subsurface, and vertical-flow systems. Juncus spp. or Phragmites are commonly used plants but any local plant can be employed. Construction requires expertise and skilled labor. Once installed, operation is relatively easy. Wetlands remove nitrogen, phosphorus, and heavy metals. Up to 90\u201398% of thermo-tolerant coliforms, 67\u201384% of MS2 coliphages, and 60\u2013100% of protozoa are inactivated or removed using hydraulic retention times of 4\u20135 days. In practice, pathogen removal is highly variable and depends on climate, type of wetland, and the kind of plant used. To completely remove helminth ova, it is necessary to couple wetlands with filtration, otherwise effluent with variable content may be produced. Breeding of mosquitoes and unpleasant odors can be a problem if wetlands are not operated correctly. Subsurface wetlands are used to avoid mosquito breeding (Correlje and Schuetze, 2008).",

Heavy metals and trace organic compounds (such as emerging pollutants) are removed mainly by adsorption.

For efficient functioning, hydraulic loads (29\u2013111 m3\n m\u22122\n yr\u22121) and mass loads should be limited. To avoid aquifer pollution, application of wastewater (preferably partially treated) is restricted to sites where groundwater is a minimum of 3 m in depth.

UASBs are considered as the most successful anaerobic process applied to treat wastewater due to low hydraulic retention time compared to other anaerobic processes thanks to the high density of biomass attained in the blanket (Campos, 1999). The reactor is designed to not only produce the biological reaction but also to sediment and filter suspended solids from wastewater. In addition, sludge retained in the bottom part of the reactor is anaerobically digested (Campos, 1999). The UASB produces better results when the wastewater has a high organic matter content. As by-products, it produces methane and partially treated sludge. The gas can be used as a source of energy, while the sludge remaining, after proper treatment to control the pathogen content, can be used to fertilize soil. UASBs remove 65\u201375% of BOD and COD and helminth eggs through filtration in the sludge blanket and through sedimentation. However, their efficiency with regard to the removal of helminth eggs is very variable. From wastewater containing 64\u2013320 eggs l\u22121, they produce effluents with 1\u201345 eggs l\u22121 (60\u201396% removal). Therefore, UASBs are frequently coupled with other treatment process such as stabilization ponds or filtration to completely and reliable remove helminth ova and to inactivate other pathogens. Several stand-alone UASB plants or those coupled with WSP are currently under operation in Curitiba, Brazil. UASB reactors require careful design and operation to avoid bypasses (Campos, 1999). The construction, operation, and maintenance of improved anaerobic technology such as biogas installations require considerable expertise and skilled labor as well as space (Correlje and Schuetze, 2008).

The introduction of new chemical products, in particular flocculants, combined with the possible reuse of treated effluent for agricultural irrigation and ocean disposal, has been instrumental in its reintroduction. Coagulation\u2013flocculation removes helminths eggs while preserving nutrients and organic matter in contents suitable to grow plants. When this process is applied using low coagulant doses combined with a high molecular weight and high charge density flocculants, it is called chemical enhanced primary treatment (CEPT). If, a high-rate settler is used instead of a conventional settler, it is referred to as advanced primary treatment (APT). As a result, CEPT has a total hydraulic retention time of 4\u20136 h while, for APT, this is only 0.5\u20131 h. Among the coagulants that have been used, iron and alum compounds are the most common. APT removes 50\u201380% of protozoan cysts (Giardia, Entamoeba coli, and E. histolytica) and 90\u201399% of helminths eggs. From a content of up to 120 eggs l\u22121, an APT can consistently produce an effluent containing 0.5\u20132 eggs l\u22121. This process produces an effluent with a low content of suspended solids or turbidity, which leads to greater disinfection efficiency, either with chlorine or with UV light. Likewise, the process allows the use of sprinkler irrigation in high-tech countries or countries where water is scarce. The effluent quality is improved by the soil effect, and aquifers can be used as water supply storage (Jim\u00e9nez, 2003, 2008).",

            "text": "The challenge for any disinfection method is that microorganisms respond differently. Efficiency depends on the disinfecting agent, the type and content of microorganism, the dosage, and the exposure time. The water matrix has as well a relevant influence, which becomes more important as its concentration and complexity increase. The most common disinfection processes for wastewater are chlorination, ozonation, and UV-light disinfection.1.\nChlorination. It is the most widely used process to control microorganisms. It is effective for the inactivation of bacteria, less so for viruses and protozoa, and not at all for helminth eggs. With regard to virus and bacteria, chlorine has inactivation efficiencies of up to 5\u20137 log. However, chlorine is a very reactive agent and, therefore, before attacking microorganisms, it reacts with many substances contained in wastewater, in particular with organic matter, hydrogen sulfide, manganese, iron, nitrites, and ammonia. As a result, chlorination is a process that, in order to be efficient, needs to be applied at the end of treatment schemes to avoid interferences. If, in treated wastewater, ammoniacal nitrogen and organic matter are still presented, chloramines and organo-chlorinated compounds are formed. These are compounds that increase cancer risks. Notwithstanding such risks, it is always preferable to chlorinate wastewater as microbial diseases have faster and often more dramatic health effects (Jim\u00e9nez, 2003).2.\nOzonation. Ozone is very effective at inactivating viruses and bacteria. It inactivates 3\u20134 log concentration units in a very short time, provided there is a low demand for oxidizing agents by wastewater. There is abundant information in the literature concerning the design and operation of the processes. Required ozone doses for several microorganisms are also available in the literature but, frequently, they are not affordable. As happens with chlorine, by-products generated during ozonation are a source of concern as many of them have been reported in the literature as toxic (Jim\u00e9nez, 2003).3.\nUV light. Nowadays, UV-light disinfection closely competes with chlorination because it does not generate by-products that are too costly to remove from wastewater. Besides, compared to chlorination, UV light does not need storage facilities, does not imply the handling of hazardous chemicals, and uses very small-size treatment tanks as disinfection contact times are very small (in the range of seconds or minutes). Furthermore, due its simplicity of operation and high adaptive potential, it is suitable for rural and isolated communities.\n",

Despite this, in many developing countries there are no reference costs, as exist in developed ones.

An ASR can have several objectives, some of which are (Dillon and Jim\u00e9nez, 2008; Jim\u00e9nez, 2003) temporary or long-term storage; decrease of disinfection by-products; reestablishment of underground water levels; maintenance or improvement of underground water quality; prevention of saline intrusion; deferment of expansion of water supply systems; aggressive water stabilization; hydraulic control of contaminant plumes; and compensation of soil salinity lixiviation. The major advantages of underground storage is that evaporation losses are considerably lower than dams (\u223c1%) and do not have the eco-environmental problems associated with them (Dillon and Jim\u00e9nez, 2008). Aquifers can be an economical option to reintegrate water to the environment in arid and semi-arid countries where it remains available for future use.

            "text": "Effluents from treatment plants can be used for the augmentation of surface water bodies, in which the effluent is diluted with freshwater and reused as a source for water. The water quality of receiving water should be preserved to facilitate a safe water supply. For this, it is important to control pollutant content in the effluent, notably pathogens, organic matter, and nutrients (especially for surface water bodies with slow flow). Two aspects need to be monitored: oxygen depletion in rivers and eutrophication in dams and lakes. To avoid oxygen depletion, biodegradable organic matter needs to be removed before introducing the wastewater. There is considerable literature available concerning this aspect as it has been the main target for most wastewater treatment processes. Control of eutrophication is achieved by removing N and/or P from effluents; this is an operation costly to perform in wastewater treatment plants for most developing countries. As an alternative, land treatment can be used or treated wastewater used first for agricultural irrigation recovering it from the agricultural drainage before sending it to on lakes. Eutrophication of dams and lakes is a frequent problem in developing countries; alternatives for its control are discussed in Box 7\n.Box 7Eutrophication Control (with information from Jim\u00e9nez B (2009b) Wastewater risks in the urban water cycle. In: Jim\u00e9nez B and Rose J (eds.) Urban Water Security: Managing Risks, p. 324. Paris: UNESCO; Leiden: Taylor and Francis Group.)Eutrophication is a process in which plants (such as water lilies or hyacinths (Eichornia crassipes), hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata), cattail \u2013(Thypa sp.), and duckweed (Lemna sp.)) proliferate in surface water bodies due to the presence of high concentrations of phosphorus and/or nitrogen that may come from wastewater, treated effluents, or agricultural runoff. It is commonly observed in polluted lakes or dams, but problems in low flow rivers and agricultural canals have also been observed. Aquatic plants cover the water surface preventing sunlight and oxygen from entering the water. Other negative effects that are provoked are (1) oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion; (2) release of Fe, Mn, NH4, and heavy metals from the sediments; (3) vector breeding, such as Schistosomas and mosquitoes; (4) loss of biodiversity, especially in higher trophic levels; (5) displacement of native species, (6) obstruction of hydroelectric plants and irrigation canals and drains; and (7) restrictions on tourist, recreational, and fishing activities. To reduce aquatic weed density (plants m\u22122), five methods are available:\u2022\nBiological control. It consists of using living organisms to control weeds. In theory, it is a cheap option as no equipment or chemicals are required but it has an associated labor cost in order to perform maintenance. To be completely effective, the rate of grazing needs to be higher than the plant growth rate, which is very difficult to match in practice. A wide variety of fish, arthropod, fungi, and bacteria have been used for this purpose.\u2022\nMechanical Control. These methods remove or cut weeds into pieces using mechanically or manually operated equipment. It is an expensive option that can play a role in quickly reducing the extent of infested areas prior to the application of another control method.\u2022\nChemical control. Pesticides are also used to control weeds. Some substances that have been used are terbutryn, diquat, 2,4-D, glyphosphate, paraquat, and simazine. However, due to their toxicity, they can only be applied under controlled conditions and for a limited period of time.\u2022\nWater level control. In this method, the water level is decreased so the weeds located close to the edges of the water body dry out. The applicability of this method is limited to dams where water levels can be controlled, and to the dry season in which rain would not convey plants once again to the water.\u2022\nNutrient control. Weed growth is caused by high N or P content in water, and so, lowering their concentration through wastewater treatment is another alternative. Unfortunately, the cost remains high.Due to their low efficiency or cost implications, in practice, two or more methods are often used to control weeds.",

            "text": "In literature, water reuse is considered merely as an activity where wastewater is intentionally treated to be used once again. Therefore, water reuse is understood as an artificial man-made practice. However, unintentional reuse also exists as part of the natural hydrological cycle, but this is frequently not acknowledged. (Jim\u00e9nez, 2009a). \u2018Nonintentional\u2019, \u2018nonplanned\u2019 or \u2018incidental\u2019 water reuse describe situations where used water is mixed with (or becomes part of) the water supply. In most cases, this unplanned reuse is difficult to identify, although it would be important to acknowledge it in order to properly control it. The nonplanned use of water is at the origin of the presence of emerging chemical pollutants in water sources and the reason why drinking water standards are becoming increasingly comprehensive and stringent and more sophisticated technologies to treat water are needed (Jim\u00e9nez, 2009b). Nonplanned reuse of wastewater is happening for agricultural irrigation, aquifer recharge, and human consumption.1.\nNonplanned reuse for agriculture. Three-quarters of the total irrigated area worldwide is located in developing countries, and, as a consequence, there is a high dependence on water for food production. Frequently, due to lack of sanitation in these countries, wastewater is used to irrigate land. This is a practice that happens almost naturally because of the combination of the high demand for water for irrigation (81% of total use compared to only 45% in developed countries, Figure 13\n), the availability of wastewater, the productivity boost that the added nutrients and organic matter provide, and the possibility to sow crops all year round (Jim\u00e9nez, 2006).It is estimated that at least 20 million hectares in 50 countries (around 10% of irrigated land) are irrigated with raw or partially treated wastewater (WHO, 2006). Approximately one-tenth of the world's population consumes crops irrigated with wastewater, diluted or not. As an example, in Hanoi, Vietnam, wastewater is used in the production of 80% of the vegetables consumed locally (Ensink et al., 2004). The use of nontreated wastewater is also common for urban agriculture, which is practiced in urban and periurban areas of arid or wet countries where there is local demand for fresh food products, and people live on the verge of poverty with no job opportunities (Jim\u00e9nez, 2009b). For urban agriculture, wastewater flowing in open channels is used to irrigate very small urban plots of land where trees, fodder, or any other product that can be introduced to the market in small quantities (flowers and vegetables) or be used as part of the family diet are grown (Ensink et al., 2004). In terms of volume, reuse of nontreated wastewater is at least 6 times higher than of treated wastewater (Jim\u00e9nez, 2006; Jim\u00e9nez and Asano, 2008). As a consequence, any sanitation project in localities using wastewater should consider its actual use.2.\nUnintentional reuse for water recharge. Since groundwater is not water that can be observed as in lakes or dams, very often its pollution and nonintentional recharge is not perceived. Infiltration may result from agricultural irrigation, leakages from wastewater and water urban networks, unlined dams, tanks or reservoirs, and on-site sanitation systems. Little information on the extent of this problem is reported in literature, but some cases (a summary is presented in Table 12\n) have been described highlighting the importance of this phenomenon as a source of water supply. For the one referring to the Tula Valley, it has been the best documented (Jim\u00e9nez, 2008b) that recharge with wastewater amounts to at least 25 m3\n s\u22121, and the aquifer is used to supply 500 000 people. Infiltration and pollution of groundwater supplies varies from negligible to severe, and the recognition of unplanned reuse is needed in order to advance understanding of how to manage the risks. This may involve continuing groundwater recharge with water of improved quality and/or separating the recharge areas further from points of water abstraction. Appropriate monitoring information will allow the most cost-effective investments to be identified (Dillon and Jim\u00e9nez, 2008).3.\nNonintentional reuse for human consumption. Nonintentional reuse for human consumption occurs as described previously, not only through aquifer recharge but also through surface water sources when effluents, treated or nontreated, are discharged into them. This has been documented in developed countries. For instance, in the River Thames in England, during dry periods, 70% of the water used as supply downstream comes from treated effluent. In California's Santa Ana River, a large part of the supply consists of treated wastewater (Gray and Sedlak, 2003) and in Berlin, 17\u201335% of the city's water supply comes from an advanced treated effluent that is discharged to a nearby water supply (Jekel and Gruenheid, 2008). The increasing evidence of the presence of emerging contaminants in water sources is an indication of the nonintentional reuse of water. Information on this subject for developing countries is very poor, and possibly only reported as pollution cases. Recognizing the nonintentional reuse of water for human consumption will help society to acknowledge that water reuse is unavoidable in the future and also to understand that, to properly reintegrate used water to the environment is needed. For this, tools other than wastewater treatment plants will be needed.\n",

            "text": "According to Asano (1998), wastewater reclamation involves the treatment or processing of wastewater to make it reusable; and wastewater reuse or water reuse is the beneficial use of treated water. Planned reuse may be performed for agricultural irrigation, industrial purposes, environment restoration, and municipal uses.1.\nReintegrating water for irrigation. Most of the world's poorest people, 800 million to 1 billion rural people, live in arid areas and depend directly on natural resources, including water, for their livelihoods (Dobie, 2001). In such a context, safe wastewater reuse can be a sanitation option that could also be coupled with food security and economic development goals. Under prevailing land and water management practices, a balanced diet represents a depleting water use of 1300 m3\n inhab\u22121\n yr\u22121, which is 70 times more than the 50 l inhab\u22121\n d\u22121 required for basic household water needs (SIWI-IMWI, 2006). For several middle- and low-income countries, agriculture is currently, and will continue to be, a key sector representing 80% of export earnings. Limited and unreliable access to water is a determining factor in agricultural productivity in many regions, a problem rooted in rainfall variability that is likely to increase with climate change (Lenghton et al., 2005). To feed this sector, water reuse can be one option.Planned reuse of water for agricultural irrigation in developing countries is a convenient strategy for many reasons (Jim\u00e9nez and Gardu\u00f1o, 2001; Jim\u00e9nez, 2006, Jim\u00e9nez, 2009a; WHO, 2006; Keraita et al., 2008), such as\u2022It is an easy option to increase controlled reuse when nontreated wastewater is already in use as it allows more profitable and safe products.\u2022It can be a low-cost option to manage wastewater and to reintegrate water into the environment.\u2022It allows the reclamation of nutrients (N and P, to increase soil fertility) and organic matter (to improve soil characteristics) at no cost.\u2022Particularly in (but not limited to) arid and semi-arid areas, it permits higher crop yields, as it allows crops to be sown year-round due to higher water availability.\u2022Due to the availability and reliability of water, crops with better profitability can be selected.\u2022It avoids discharging pollutants to surface water bodies (which have a considerably lower treatment capability than soils).\u2022It is possible to recharge certain type of aquifers through infiltration.\u2022It can be part of a strategy to secure food and increase poor people's income in water-scarce areas.To obtain all the advantages from reusing wastewater for agriculture in planned projects, it is important (1) to control possible negative effects (Jim\u00e9nez, 2006; WHO, 2006) such as those related to health; (2) to keep in mind that in many cases nontreated wastewater is being reused at low or even no cost by poor farmers and, hence, they will be unable to afford reuse costs; and (3) from the legal aspect, the historical use of nontreated wastewater by farmers confers riparian rights.\n2.\nReintegrating water for industrial reuse. Industrial reuse (reclamation of wastewater from a different use, i.e., reuse of a municipal effluent for industrial cooling) differs from municipal and agriculture reuse as it involves the private sector that has its own rules and well-defined needs driven by economic factors (Jim\u00e9nez and Asano, 2008). Before reusing water, industries always prefer to implement water-saving projects as these immediately reflect on their budgets; for reusing water, investments to provide proper treatment and monitoring programs are needed. To promote industrial reuse, the best government strategy is to provide incentives rather than setting compulsory regulations (Jim\u00e9nez and Asano, 2008). Among the different industrial reuse options, cooling is the most popular due to its high water demand, and the possibility of using secondary-treated municipal effluents, sometimes coupled with filtration or softening processes. As a consequence, power plants located near urban areas are potential sites of industrial water reuse.3.\nReintegrating water to the environment. More than 1.4 billion people live in river basins where the intense use of water threatens freshwater ecosystems (Smakhtin et al., 2004). Reintegrating water to the environment is a practice that is gaining momentum, as it is being recognized that (1) the environment needs water and (2) the environment has the same entitlement to water as other uses. Unfortunately, these two aspects are better recognized by developed countries than developing ones. Overuse of water tends to occur in regions heavily dependent on irrigated agriculture or where there is rapid growth of densely populated areas (UNDP, 2006), two characteristics common in developing countries. Among the more prominent examples (UNDP, 2006) of water overuse, the exploitation of the Yellow River basin, in northern China, can be cited: Human withdrawal currently leaves less than 10% of the flow remaining in the river. The river ran dry 600 km inland for a record 226 days in 1997. The drying up of the river caused a drop in agricultural production averaging 2.7\u20138.5 million tons a year, with losses estimated at US$1.7 billion for 1997. The purified effluent from sewage treatment plants can be used for the augmentation of river flows, to raise the level of wetlands or lakes, to recover dried lakes, or even to create new lakes or wetlands. In doing so, biodiversity may recover. Care must be taken when restoring water into water bodies to preserve or improve the actual quality of water. Used water reclamation can be combined with rainwater reclamation. Water reuse with environmental restoration can be coupled with projects of urban image improvement or programs to provide better facilities at recreational areas.4.\nRestoring water to aquifers. Aquifer recharge is not, itself, a use of reclaimed water but is often part of the pathway to reuse. It is a convenient way to reintegrate water into the environment but can be used only under certain circumstances related, in particular, to the type of soil and groundwater. Aquifer recharge can be performed to recover groundwater levels, to control saline intrusion, to augment drinking water sources, to protect and, in some cases, to improve underground water quality, to protect surface water bodies from contamination by effluents, to increase water availability for any use, and simply to store water for the future (Dillon and Jim\u00e9nez, 2008; Corrleje et al., 2008). Intentional recharge with reclaimed water can play a role in providing balanced storage and supplemental treatment for water (Bouwer, 2002; Dillon and Toze, 2005). It also provides low-cost storage that occupies a minimum of valuable urban land, while stored water is protected from pollution and evaporation. There are two methods to recharge aquifers. The first is known as land-spread infiltration where treated wastewater infiltrates through soil by gravity. This option has relatively low operating and maintenance costs. The second method for recharge is direct well injection. In this option, wells are used to convey a highly treated effluent directly to aquifers. Regulation to recharge aquifers are very different from one country to another; some are set at a national level while others are defined using a case-by-case approach (Jim\u00e9nez, 2003). Most of the projects to recharge aquifers are found in developed countries. In developing ones, some examples are found in Atlantis, South Africa (for drinking and agricultural purposes, using pond infiltration), in Windhoek, Namibia (for drinking purposes and using injection wells), in New Delhi, India (for irrigation using infiltration ponds for treated urban wastewater and stormwater), in Beijing, China (for drinking purposes using wells and recharge basins), and in Mexico City, Mexico (for drinking purposes on a limited scale and using infiltration ponds; Dillon and Jim\u00e9nez, 2008). In all these cases, wastewater is treated to at least at a secondary level (see section titled \u2018Relevant websites\u2019).5.\nReintegrating water for municipal use. In 20 years, 60% of the world's population will be living in cities (UN, 2006). This being the case, more water will be needed for municipal use and, at the same time, more municipal wastewater will be produced. This situation, therefore, represents an opportunity to increase municipal wastewater reuse. Water reuse in cities represents an opportunity to conveniently treat wastewater, with environmental and even economic advantages. Opportunities to reuse wastewater in cities are classified into two groups: (1) those demanding relatively low-quality water and involving low health risks, and (2) those demanding high-quality water where health risks are high. In the first group, there are several types of uses, such as: (a) the filling of recreational lakes or the operation of fountains; (b) car, truck, or street washing; and (c) green area irrigation. Options demanding high water quality include reuse for drinking supply. Around the world, there are successful examples of both types of reuse, low risk options being the most common. Water reuse for human consumption, although less common, is no less important. Moreover, the only two examples of the reuse of water for human consumption in the world are notably from two countries from the developing world: Namibia and Singapore (Box 8).\nBox 8Reuse of wastewater for human consumption in Namibia and SingaporeWindhoek, Namibia, has been reusing wastewater for human consumption for more than 40 years (Van der Merwe et al., 2008) as result of an original idea in 1956. Since its operation, no measurable health risk has been observed and neither have people drinking reused water displayed associated health problems. The reclamation plant has undergone several modifications to improve the technology used. The quality of the water supplied can be consulted every day in the local newspaper. The amount of water reused is around 250 ls\u22121, which is distributed after dilution by a factor of 1\u20133 with first-use water. The monitoring program for the facility represents 20% of the operating costs, and is performed by the wastewater treatment plant and also by three independent laboratories. The system is operated using a multiple barrier concept that goes beyond the wastewater treatment plant. The astute words \u201cWater should be judged by its quality; not its history\u201d are attributed to Dr. Lucas van Vuuren (van der Merwe et al., 2008), one of the pioneers of the Windhoek reclamation system. This refers to the fact that fear of reused water should be based on rational aspects.The other example of direct reuse of wastewater for human consumption comes from Singapore (Funamizu et al., 2008) and is known as the NEWater project. It started in 2003 and uses a secondary effluent that is further treated with a membrane system (microfiltration (MF) and reverse osmosis (RO)) and UV-light disinfection. The water produced is cleaner than tap water as it fulfills all the requirements set by US-EPA and WHO for drinking purposes. Treated water is channeled to a reservoir, from which it is taken as supply after dilution with first-use water. Water is distributed through the network for use for domestic and industrial purposes. When the NEWater project was launched, it operated at a rate of 870 l s\u22121. This will be progressively increased to reach 2400 l s\u22121 by 2011 (\u223c0.5% and 2.5% of total water consumption, respectively). In both cases, Namibia and Singapore, before the implementation of the reuse programs, stringent industrial pre-treatment programs and segregation of industrial effluent from the sewer were put in place.",

Typical sources of graywater are bathing, laundry, dishwashing, and food preparation. Due to its comparably low and easily degradable contamination, it can be relatively easily treated for reuse. Graywater reclamation entails the production of less wastewater to be treated in centralized plants. Graywater reuse is performed at the same facilities where it is produced and, as a result, a short storage time is needed (1 day retention time). Graywater reuse can be performed individually (for a single home) or collectively (several groups of houses or larger buildings). Treated graywater may be used for watering plants, kitchen gardens, and for the safe augmentation of ground- or surface water. Treatment can be very simple or highly sophisticated, ranging from simple manually operated sand filters to biomembrane reactors, hence, covering the needs for rural areas or buildings located in upmarket areas in megacities. Further details on design and operation can be found in Correlje and Schuetze (2008). Graywater reuse can be as well an important component for basic sanitation, as described in Section 4.06.6.1.",

(2008) performed a survey in some countries showing that the tendencies are the following:1.\nFor middle-income countries. From information coming from 10 middle-income countries, including Africa (Namibia and South Africa), the Middle East (Iran, Jordan and Turkey), Asia (China and Russian Federation), and Latin America (Brazil, Colombia and Mexico), it is shown that wastewater treatment facilities serve mostly urban areas using preliminary, primary, and, in some cases, secondary processes. For rural or poor periurban areas, basic sanitation facilities are provided. Although sludge is produced in these facilities, this is not always managed as part of the sanitation service. The disposal options for the sludge from wastewater treatment plants produced are landfill dumping, dumping into sewers, storage at wastewater treatment plants, land application, and agricultural reclamation. Land application and agricultural reclamation are options limited by space problems, while the use of landfills is restricted in densely populated urban areas, where solid wastes compete for space with sludge. As sludge production is still low in the few wastewater treatment plants available, sludge management policies are novel, and are still in a maturation phase. Some of these policies offer new approaches different to those used in developed countries (LeBlanc et al., 2008). With regard to fecal sludge, the main constraint for their management is the cost to empty on-site sanitation systems as these are often located in inaccessible areas, are large in number, and are frequently highly dispersed. It is noted that the high cost of latrine emptying is not sustainable, even for large municipalities. Extracted fecal sludge is often buried on-site, dumped into landfills or sewers or sent to uncontrolled discharge sites. Discharge of sludge and fecal sludge in sewers often lead to surpass the wastewater treatment plants\u2019 capacity when available.2.\nFor low-income countries. Data from different African countries (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa) demonstrated a similar situation focused on the need to provide basic sanitation services either in rural or urban areas. Few cities have complete sewerage systems and, when available, sewers frequently feed into partially functioning wastewater treatment plants. In these countries, the use of on-site sanitation systems, such as septic tanks, bucket latrines, pit latrines, and dry latrines, produces fecal sludge, which is often \u2018contaminated\u2019 with domestic waste. In dense informal settlements, the challenges to properly handle fecal sludge are significant as besides the technical constraints other factors related to the social, political, and cultural aspects come into play. Fecal sludge handling includes the need to provide reliable and low-cost options to emptying the facilities, to provide proper and affordable treatment and transportation, and to have suitable sites for safe disposal.\n",

Every Drop Counts: Environmentally Sound Technologies for Urban and Domestic Water Use Efficiency. Division of Technology, Industry and Economics, TU Delft. India: United Nations Environment Programme.Bissau, Guinea, in West Africa is a city attracting huge numbers of people from the surrounding countryside. Most of them have settled in squatter new areas around the old colonial center. During a study performed in the 1990s, it was found that the newly piped water taps ran dry several times per day. As a result, many people returned to the old wells. These were often more contaminated than before because the new pit latrines installed close to the wells polluted the groundwater. Groundwater quality was also impacted by solid waste thrown into the pits dug for the production of adobe blocks to build new houses. Moreover, the new network of gutters was now efficiently removing most of the clean rainwater that used to recharge the groundwater. The gutters caused an extra problem. On the edge of the settlements, where the gutters ended, storm water peaks caused serious soil erosion. This created problems for a newly developed scheme of vegetable gardens on the urban fringe, and even threatened houses.The original problem \u2013 the lack of water in piped water taps \u2013 was related to electrical power failures causing water pumps to stop. Similar situations can be encountered in many developing countries and they cannot be easily solved as long as their roots are not properly and integrally tackled.",

Global Atlas of Excreta, Wastewater Sludge, and Biosolids Management: Moving Forward the Sustainable and Welcome Uses of a Global Resource: UNHSP, pp. 169\u2013179. Vienna: UN).In Cameroon, some houses are equipped with a 2 m-deep hole for a latrine, surrounded by pieces of timber. When the hole is full, it is covered with earth and medicinal or aromatic plants, and another facility is built. If the family has no land to dig another hole (as frequently happens), they call the tanker to empty it at a cost of US$120. Sometimes, while the family saves up the money, excreta overflows and pollutes the nearby area where wells and boreholes are located, threatening drinking water quality. When feces are removed by tanker trucks, they are often dumped into rivers or the forest, because there are no treatment facilities.Houses in modern residential areas have septic tanks, and their effluents are directed into wells for filtration. Often, this does not happen in the correct way because builders have not mastered the technology. Some collective residential areas, universities, and hospitals are connected to sewers that convey wastewater to a treatment plant, from where treated water is directed to a river.But still, there are people without access to any of the facilities described above who go into the bush to relieve themselves on the spot. Villagers continue to use this practice because they have no choice.",

In order to develop political will, politicians and society need to appreciate the value of sanitation. An understanding that it is through the provision of water supply and sanitation that industrialized countries build up strong societies with good health and good economic conditions is needed (Box 12).2.The second challenge is to put in place accountability mechanisms to ensure that resources provided to fulfill the MDGs (public and private from donors) will be used wisely and for what they were originally intended for.3.The third challenge involves a broader aspect. Even if sanitation programs are put in place, if poverty is not properly addressed, most of the solutions provided will be unsustainable. This will possibly lead in the future to adding addressing poverty to the already lengthy list of reasons why sanitation has failed in developing countries (this list already comprises financing, institutions, education, the need for decentralization, and the need for private participation).\nBox 12Clean means\u2026\u2026 healthy?Mexico City produces 21% of Mexico's gross domestic product (GPD) (US$12 500 per capita). After the swine flu (H1N1 flu) outbreak in May 2009, a loss of US$144 million was experienced solely due to the shutting down of restaurants, and US$35.2 million were lost due to the closure of public transport for just 10 days. To allow the city to return to normal conditions, health experts advised constant handwashing and the disinfection of school toilets. At this point, politicians realized that 200 public schools had no water at all, 195 had malfunctioning toilets and 90 more had no facilities at all. Before the swine flu epidemic, politicians had not understood the link between water, sanitation, and health and had not addressed this problem, although on many occasions parents\u2019 associations had requested the services. The president of one parents\u2019 association commented on the news that, in contrast to most Mexicans, he believed that the swine flu had been a blessing as it was the only way to ensure proper sanitation facilities at schools.

(2005) Health, Dignity and Development: What Will It Take? Millennium Development Goals. London: Earthscan.Water and sanitation service agencies are typically modeled after utilities in industrial countries, and as such are organized around the goals of maximizing operational efficiency for public sanitation components (trunk sewers and treatment plants) rather than providing services to poor people, slums, disadvantaged groups, etc. As result, in, in developing countries, experience and institutional structures to provide the type of services needed is deficient. As a result, services are being provided by other means. Data from India indicate that as much as 8% of rural households across the country invest their own money and use small private providers to construct latrines. Self-provision accounts for about 1 million privately installed septic tanks in Manila and in Jakarta. Research in Africa confirms that the role of the small-scale private sector in sanitation provision is significant. These findings are further supported by data from the JMP (WHO-UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme): between 1990 and 2000, the increase in the number of people served by sanitation reported by the JMP was much larger than the expected impacts of the public investment that occurred during this period. The reorientation of public programs to either modify their structures or to promote and assist the provision of sanitation services by small private and even familiar companies is needed.

Global Atlas of Excreta, Wastewater Sludge, and Biosolids Management: Moving Forward the Sustainable and Welcome Uses of a Global Resource: UNHSP, pp. 431\u2013437. Vienna: UN.)Following Mozambique's independence in 1975, the government identified sanitation as one of the key components to improve health conditions. As such, in 1976, the Ministry of Health launched an intensive national campaign for the self-help construction of latrines. Many thousands of latrines were constructed during a relatively short period. However, there were numerous problems, including insufficient awareness about environmental conditions, a lack of technical guidance in latrine design and construction, and shortages of critical building materials. Consequently, many of the latrines became structurally unsafe and unusable. In response, a research project was initiated in 1979 to \u201cidentify and develop a suitable technology and method for large-scale implementation of improved sanitation in periurban areas.\u201d The result was the development and successful pilot testing of an appropriate and cost-effective technology. From 1979 to 1994, around 135 000 improved latrines were produced. In addition, an awareness campaign was carried out on the use of the latrine, hygiene promotion, and capacity building. In 1996, the program was extended to the rural areas. Prior to 1998, more than 230 000 latrines were constructed and installed. In December 1998, the program was formally transferred to the National Directorate of Water Affairs. Overall, it has been a long and steady scaling-up process over more than 10 years that ended by ensuring a progressive withdrawal of the government from latrine production. The emphasis now is given to decentralization and privatization for the services, although the responsibility for the program remains with the government. From this experience, some lessons learned, are\u2022Although technology must be simple, it is important for massive use to ensure its local production and commercialization. There must be several types of sanitation facilities with different prices in order to commercialize.\u2022A good network needs to be established between users (periurban communities, the government, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), small private companies, and donors) to ensure that the program progressively developed its own dynamism.\u2022Latrines need to be emptied and the service needs to be provided.\n",

These nonconventional private enterprises have been called by some \u2018informal\u2019 although for several developing countries, they have in many cases proven to be more formal, useful, and to provide more reliable services than formal ones.

In order to implement what needs to be provided is, for the governments, to identify the main requirements, the areas of responsibility, the risks associated, who is responsible for what, the different options to address needs, and the associated costs. Once this is performed, it is required to review, set up or adapt the legal and institutional framework, and to educate all the persons involved (from society to politicians, experts, regulators, private companies and functionaries, besides children and women). Sanitation management (basic sanitation facilities management, wastewater collection, treatment and reintegration, by-product management, and risk control) requires the coordination of different public institutions, society, academia, private enterprises, and in some cases, even different countries. Therefore, the government is needed to set up the programs.Box 15How industrialized governments approached funding for sanitation (with information from Lenghton L, Wright A, and Davis K (eds.) (2005) Health, Dignity and Development: What Will It Take? Millennium Development Goals. London: Earthscan.)In general, in developed countries, public water infrastructure components have been highly subsidized by governments, reflecting an understanding that the public health benefits of sanitation generate substantial positive external gains that merit public investment. In Britain, for example, urban authorities borrowed more than \u00a37.7 million for sewerage work during the period 1880\u201391. Eventually, the public provision of sanitation became an uncontroversial and indeed, an expected part of life. Similarly, for many municipalities in the United States, public financing of sanitation infrastructure was seen as the only option for ensuring investment adequate to protect public health. In the nineteenth century, Boston, for example, had lower-than-expected connection rates among households to the city's new water and sewer network; this prompted the city to cover the cost of service pipes for all unconnected households. In 1850, an influential state sanitary survey concluded that governments must accept responsibility for financing public sanitation infrastructure because, left to their own devices, a large proportion of Massachusetts residents would be unable or unwilling to take on personal responsibility to conduct their lives in accord with recommended sanitary principles. Until recently, grants of up to 70% or more were provided for innovative sanitation technologies in the United States.",

Theoretically, private companies, if well used by the government, could be useful to increase sanitation coverage if the level of society is raised and private companies are not used to increase the already-considerable differences existing between economic social classes. Nevertheless, private participation is not increasing in sanitation. After steadily increasing at a global level between 1990 and 1997, it began to decrease (Lenghton et al., 2005). There are many reasons for this, one of which is that it is not easy to build up successful schemes combining private and public interests.",

Middle-income countries have fewer needs and more economical capacity to meet their MDGs. For some, it is estimated that they could use up to 15% of their GDP, and hence it is considered that no external finance is needed (Lenghton et al., 2005). Moreover, this situation, from the point of view of some authors, offers to inform the private sector of great opportunities to conduct a business and, as a result, in several middle-income countries private funding is being promoted. One possible risk, which needs to be considered by local government and known by society in general, is that through private participation and international loans, technology and sanitation schemes from other countries are promoted, which do not always effectively solve local problems in the cheapest and most efficient way.

However, this may not match the actual needs or promote local economic development. In some other cases, developing countries are even used as laboratory testing grounds for new magic solutions. In low- and middle-income countries, examples can be found where a significant part of the investment made for wastewater treatment plants is used to pay for the intellectual property rights of the processes, as happens with many other activities. In Figure 16\n, it is shown that royalties received because of patents in developing countries are nonexistent or low while those for developed countries are high; sanitation could be in the future another source of this dependency and inequity. On the top of this, some of these processes do not solve actual problems and, as a result, around the world, several places can be found where new solutions for providing sanitation to poor people have been installed in series unsuccessfully. This situation has two negative effects: first, it discourages donors from making further investments and, second, it makes local people wary of possible solutions.
