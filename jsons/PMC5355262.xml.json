            "text": "The receptors on the host cells acting at the host-pathogen interface as the first surveillance system for primary infection are called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The family of toll-like receptors (TLRs) is the best characterized class of PRRs in mammalian species [3]. TLR signaling can result in either the production of type 1 interferon co-stimulatory molecules or the induction of a proinflammatory cytokine cascade [4], which includes various known cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and antimicrobial peptides, all of which have elevated values in the acute stage plasma of KD [5\u20137]. Currently, 10 TLRs have been identified in humans and 12 in mice, including bacterial peptidoglycan (detected by TLR1), lipoprotein and lipoteichoic acids (detected by TLR2), double-stranded RNA (detected by TLR3), LPS (detected by TLR4), flagellin (detected by TLR5), single-stranded viral RNA (detected by TLR7 and 8), and the unmethylated CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) DNA of bacteria and viruses (detected by TLR9) [8]. Although researchers have yet to unequivocally identify consistent infectious pathogens in KD patients [9, 10], we previously found elevated TLR2 expression on monocytes in both KD patients and mice with lactobacillus casei cell wall extract (LCWE)-induced coronary arteritis [5]. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that TLR 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 may trigger the initial immune response in KD patients [11\u201313].",

Therefore, studying the differential expressions and methylation alteration of TLRs between KD patients and control subjects has merit. No studies have yet surveyed TLRs 1\u201310 in the same report or performed analysis with methylation profile.

We found that the methylation levels of TLR1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 were significantly decreased in the acute stage of KD patients compared to the healthy and febrile controls (Figure 4). However, after IVIG administration, the methylation status of TLR1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 was significantly elevated in KD patients (Figure 5). Since lower methylation leads to greater gene expression [15], we focused on the correlation between DNA methylation patterns and gene expressions. As shown in Figure 5, TLR1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 demonstrate a hypo-methylated status in KD patients prior to undergoing IVIG treatment compared with the control subjects and the KD patients after undergoing IVIG treatment. Therefore, the mRNA expression level and DNA methylation of these TLRs demonstrate negative correlations. To ensure un-biased results, we performed 10,000 re-samplings [16] for each TLR to extract pairs of gene intensity and CpG marker \u03b2 values in each group. Therefore, we collected 40,000 pairs of gene intensity and CpG marker \u03b2 values from the four groups. Figure 6 demonstrates that gene expression level and CpG marker methylation were significantly negatively correlated (p < 0.001 for all TRLs), thus indicating that DNA methylation represses gene expression.",

            "text": "TLRs recognize a group of pathogen-associated molecular patterns but also damage the associated molecular patterns. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), an endogenous damage associated with molecular patterns, serves as danger signaling and provides a framework for understanding the overlapping inflammatory responses activated by pathogens and injury [22]. Furthermore, elevated HMGB1 levels have been found in KD patients [23] as a potential marker for poor response to IVIG treatment [23]. Similarly, HMGB1 has been shown not only to amplify inflammation but also to increase vascular inflammation in various vasculitis diseases [24]. The receptors involved in HMGB1 signal transduction are TLR2 and TLR4 [25], which is consistent with our findings that both TLR2 and TLR4 increased in KD patients and then decreased after IVIG treatment. Moreover, TLR4 dependent macrophage signaling is associated with coronary arterial disease [26]. Lipopolysaccharide, a TLR4 agonist, has been shown to drive hepcidin expression [27]. Hepcidin is triggered during infections and inflammation [28]. In a previous study, we were the first to show that hepcidin induces transient anemia and hypoferremia in the acute inflammatory phase of KD [29]. Furthermore, TLR6 functionally produces heterodimer with TLR2 to facilitate intracellular response to bacterial lipoprotein [30], while TLR9 appears to respond to unmethylated CpG of bacterial DNA [8]. Our results showed remarkable activation of TLR1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9, which correlates with bacteria-related pathogen-associated molecular patterns, except for activation of TLR3 and 7, which relates to double-stranded RNA and single-stranded viral RNA in the acute stage of KD. These results support the evidence that KD is a bacterium-like inflammatory disease. During the past 50 years, since Dr. Kawasaki's first report in 1967, many studies have attempted to identify a definitive infectious agent that causes KD but have not succeeded. However, certain superantigens from bacteria and intracellular pathogens have been implicated in KD. Various bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, have been isolated in KD patients [31, 32]. On the other hand, Chang et al. reported that common respiratory viruses, such as coronaviruses, adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and rhinoviruses, were associated with KD [33]. Stating for certain whether KD is the result of a bacterial infection or a viral infection is still not possible. Taken together, KD is not a purely infectious disease with a cause-effect relationship with any pathogens but can occur in hosts with certain genetic backgrounds.",

In this study, we demonstrated the DNA methylation on TLRs and alterations between KD patients before and after IVIG administration and the control subjects. We then showed that hypomethylation at gene promoters of TLR1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 increases the expression of downstream genes. Vogelpoel et al. reported that the cross-talk between FCGR2A and TLRs in human dendritic cells activated anti-bacterial immunity through the selective induction of TNF\u03b1 and Th17-promoting cytokines response, which agrees with our previous findings regarding Th-17, TNF\u03b1, and FCGR2A in KD [17, 34]. The present study is the first to demonstrate that epigenetics of DNA methylation on TLRs may influence downstream gene expression in KD.",
