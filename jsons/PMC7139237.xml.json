A cluster of about 40 cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported, some of the patients being vendors and dealers in the Huanan Seafood market there. World Health Organization (WHO) along with Chinese authorities started working together and the etiological agent was soon established to be a new virus and was named Novel Corona Virus (2019-nCoV). Meanwhile, on 11th January China announced its first COVID-19 related death of a 61-year-old man, exposed to the seafood market (WHO, 2020a). Over a period of few weeks, the infection spread across the globe in rapid pace (WHO, 2020b). Looking at the stretch of countries this outbreak spread to, WHO declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30th January 2020 (WHO, 2020b, 2020c). Amidst the increasing deaths in China, the first death outside China was (of a Chinese man from Wuhan) reported in the Philippines on 2nd February. On 11th February, WHO announced a name for the new coronavirus disease: COVID-19 (WHO, 2020c). On the 11th of March, WHO declared COVID-19 - a pandemic as by then about 114 countries were affected (WHO, 2020c).",

Fear is the breeding ground for hatred and stigma. Social stigma has arisen as certain populations (Indian north-east people) are targeted as being the reason for this outbreak (WHO, 2020c). It is vital to avoid this stigma as it can make people hide their illness and not seek health care immediately. WHO is providing expert guidance and answers to public questions, to help people manage fear, stigma, and discrimination during COVID-19 (WHO, 2020c). As research into COVID-19 continues, a lot of the facts keep on changing and many myths are also prevalent in the general population regarding the prevention and management of the infection. In the time of widespread use of social media, these myths along with fake news around corona are also spreading rapidly. These are sometimes very disturbing for certain individuals. Several sites including WHO are thus providing myth busters and authentic information (WHO, 2020c). Governments are also urging people to not sharing these messages without checking their authenticity.",

Especially in a country like India which is a densely populated country without a robust healthcare infrastructure, it is a cause of worry. Some degree of panic also resides in public due to the unavailability of basic protection measures. As of 30th March 2020, Indian Govt. has registered a total of 1250 cases (1117 active cases, 101 cured or discharged and 32 deaths) due to COVID-19 infection (MoHFW, 2020). The governments, media, doctors, researchers, celebrities, police and other stakeholders of the society appealed to the public to avoid public gatherings including sports, religious ceremonies, family functions, meetings as well as classes in school, to prevent the global spread of coronavirus infection (McCloskey et al., 2020).

But, a study from Ethiopia reported, poor knowledge and erroneous believes of healthcare professionals, during the Ebola virus outbreak in 2015 and it urged for intense training of the healthcare professionals (Abebe et al., 2016).

A similar study, evaluating the knowledge, attitude, and perception of Ebola virus infection among secondary school children of Nigeria, found that most of the participants had inadequate knowledge and carried a negative attitude towards the outbreak (Ilesanmi and Alele, 2016).",

It also can lead to limitations in daily activities, avoidance behavior causing limited socialization, self-medication. Because of anxiety, people adopt various unwanted lifestyle and dietary modifications under the influence of rumors. These may affect mental health adversely. Hence, it is important to deal with the mental health difficulties in situations of the pandemic. Similarly, additional changes like \u2013 isolation, social distancing, self-quarantine, restriction of travel and the ever-spreading rumors in social media are also likely to affect mental health adversely (Banerjee, 2020). In our study, we found approximately 28 % of people reporting sleep difficulties. More than two-thirds of participants reported themselves worried after seeing posts about COVID-19 pandemic in various social media platforms and approximately 46 % of participants reported their worries related to the discussion of COVID-19 pandemic in news channels and print media. This indicates that a significant proportion of participants in the survey, despite having adequate awareness about coronavirus infection, are largely influenced by media information. Media influences the mental well-being and add to the level of anxiety. The swine flu pandemic of 2009\u20132010, which resulted in high mortality worldwide also caught global media attention and evoked anxiety among the public significantly (Everts, 2013).",
