Traditionally, public health was viewed as a realm of almost exclusive national jurisdiction and multilateral cooperation in this realm was restricted to discrete areas. Public health law today remains predominantly domestic and national, but the field of international public health law is extant and growing. Through the codification of binding global health law standards that regulate interstate behavior and national conduct as well as the creation of other global norms that influence state actions, international public health law has expanding significance in national public health law and policy.",

Of particular importance was a pioneering human rights approach to the global HIV/AIDS pandemic adopted by WHO in the late 1980s. It is widely recognized that this novel emphasis on the linkage between public health and human rights law had a groundbreaking impact in that it compelled governments to be publicly accountable on an international stage for their actions against persons living with HIV/AIDS (Gruskin and Tarantola, 2002). Ultimately, this innovative global political approach to public health issues publicly highlighted for the very first time the underlying legal responsibility of governments to protect and promote the health of their populations and has served as a forerunner for increasingly widespread links between human rights and other public health issues (Mann and Tarantola, 1998).",

Of particular concern is the impact of international intellectual property protection under the World Trade Organization TRIPS Agreement, discussed in the section titled \u2018The World Trade Organization: 1994 Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement and Access to Essential Medicines,\u2019 in restricting access to essential medicines, particularly HIV/AIDS antiretrovirals, in most developing countries. The unprecedented human catastrophe posed by HIV/AIDS has led the international community to adopt a number of nonbinding resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly, the former United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the World Health Organization specifying the relationship between HIV/AIDS, human rights, and access to medicines. Most recently, in June 2006, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a Political Declaration on AIDS (UN Res. 60/262) reaffirming that access to medicines in the context of pandemics, including HIV/AIDS, is one of the fundamental elements to achieving full realization for everyone of the international right to health.",

In 1997, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) adopted a nonbinding instrument, the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights. In addition, in the wake of failed treaty negotiations, in 2005 the United Nations General Assembly adopted a declaration urging Member States to prohibit reproductive cloning as incompatible with human rights.

The recent connection between health and human rights in contemporary international law and practice discussed in the preceding section is an important example of the linkage of two traditionally distinct realms of international law. The evolution of the concept of human security provides another interesting example of this development. The traditional understanding of human security has come under increasing pressure in recent years, with growing support for a comprehensive approach to human security that addresses the wide-ranging factors that impact upon the vulnerability of people. In 2003, the UN Commission on Human Security released a report proposing a new security framework and recognizing the linkage between health and human security (United Nations Commission on Human Security, 2003). In addition, expanding global concern with weapons of mass destruction and terrorism has underscored the strong interconnection between public health and security. For example, legal commitments established under WHO's new International Health Regulations, described further herein, are clearly designed to apply to releases of biological, chemical, and radiological events, accidental and deliberate.",

Consequently, the elaboration of international law has focused on the establishment of consensual rules concerning the status of states and their fundamental rights and obligations as well as commitments.

Analogous to domestic legal concepts such as usage of the trade and course of dealing, the idea behind customary international law is that widespread international practice undertaken out of a sense of legal duty creates reasonable expectations of future observance and constitutes implicit consent to the creation of legal rules. The determination of whether or not a particular practice constitutes customary international law is a complex analysis that is more like an art than a science. But, generally, the determination requires near uniform state practice undertaken because of a sense of legal obligation. With some important exceptions, once a rule is recognized as part of customary international law, it is generally considered binding upon all states. For example, the Vienna Convention is accepted as declaratory of customary international law and binding for all states, including those that have not formally ratified it. Like treaty law, customary international law is said to emanate from the consent of states. States party to a treaty explicitly consent to be bound by codified rules, whereas with customary international law states implicitly agree to be bound to particular rules through consistent state practice.",

However named, general declaratory resolutions are, for the most part, intended to be nonbinding instruments expressing the common interest of many states in specific areas of international cooperation. Of course, nothing in such resolutions prohibits states from incorporating the terms of the instruments into national law. One well-known example of a nonbinding international code in the public health field is the WHO Code of Marketing Breastmilk Substitutes. Although generally nonbinding, such instruments are not without significance. Like treaties, these nonbinding instruments can be mechanisms for advancing international consensus on rules and for promoting consistent state action. For example, the WTO Doha Declaration on Trade and Public Health, discussed below, is widely considered to have advanced global understanding and, perhaps, action on trade and health matters, particularly in relation to access to essential medicines, even though the legal significance of the declaratory instrument is unclear.",

Such instruments are often carefully negotiated and, at times, drafted with the intention to influence state practice. Soft-law instruments, at times, have also paved the way for the evolution of treaty law by generating an on-going diplomatic forum. It is important to recognize that not all resolutions lead to the development of formalized obligations or are a significant factor in state practice. However, intergovernmental resolutions, particularly resolutions of the UN General Assembly that are supported by influential states often have a political significance that can stimulate national behavior and lead to the eventual development of binding international law.",

The innate weakness of international law stems in large part from the core principle of state sovereignty. The law that is made and the law that is implemented depend upon the will of states. In the treaty-making process, states are explicitly agreeing to make rules to govern and, thereby, limit their own conduct and that of their nationals through the development and implementation of legislation and other policies, depending upon the terms of the treaty, which are consistent with their international commitments. The concept of sovereignty looms large in the international system and states are generally loath to sacrifice their freedom of action through the development of binding international obligations. A related weakness stemming from the principle of sovereignty is the general lack of enforcement mechanisms in most contemporary economic and social agreements. In contrast to the dispute resolution mechanism established under the WTO, described below in the section on the \u2018World Trade Organization\u2019, in most social and economic treaties states do not include machinery to compel parties to comply with their international legal commitments.",

The scope of international law was only expanded in the twentieth century to include individuals and international organizations.

To begin with, in an era of globalization the exclusive focus on territorial statehood is irrelevant to global health policy. Non-states ranging from Taiwan to Palestine are excluded from a range of international agreements because of lack of statehood. In addition, the major actors in global health policy today, including foundations, most notably the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and a wide range of significant public\u2013private partnerships, such as the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations and the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, or civil society organizations, such as Medicines sans Frontiers, are also excluded from the international lawmaking process.

The failure of the international community to secure an effective mechanism under TRIPS to ensure the production and export of essential medicines to meet the health needs of developing states as well as growing recognition of the link between access to medicines and human rights have led to proposals for a radical shift in the way in which pharmaceutical research and development is undertaken, including proposals for a new research and development treaty described above. A critical global public health challenge for the coming years will be to ensure pharmaceutical research and access to essential medicines for the benefit of all.",

            "text": "This article has provided a broad overview of the rapidly expanding field of international health law. This is an era of significant change in health policy. Over the last decade and a half, public health has emerged as an issue central to virtually all areas of multilateralism, ranging from arms control to security to human rights to trade. At the same time, the global dimensions of public health are transforming traditional approaches to public health. Globalization has limited the capacity of governments to protect health within their sovereign borders through unilateral action alone and national and international health are increasingly recognized as intertwined and inseparable. In addition, the idea that governments have human rights responsibilities to protect and promote public health and can and should be held accountable domestically and internationally for their actions is gaining widespread acceptance. In this new era of global health governance, international law has an important role to play in promoting and coordinating international cooperation and national action. Through the establishment of international health commitments, states legally bind themselves to establish, implement and, at times, coordinate national health laws and national health policy.",

Recent developments in international health law and diplomacy have led to increasing calls for international lawmaking in an expanding number of areas related to public health. It is important to recognize that international law is not an appropriate policy instrument for all global health problems. Given the substantial limitations of international law and the international legislative process, careful consideration should be given to the selection of global health concerns and the construction of legal regimes in future international health lawmaking enterprises. Policy makers must give high priority to identifying if and how legal strategies can contribute to the agenda in international health cooperation, including, most importantly, the major challenges that plague many developing nations. At the same time, increased attention should be paid to the impact, both positive and negative, of existing international law on population health. It is hoped that increased attention to the impact of international law, most notably international trade law, will open up critical avenues for advancing human health.",
