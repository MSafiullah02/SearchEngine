We then analyzed whether any polymorphisms in ACE2, TMPRSS2, or the HLA region were enriched in either Covid-19 positive individuals or in Covid-19 positive inpatients. We found that a single HLA variant (DQA1_509, P = 1.0 x 10 -5 ) was enriched in Covid-19 positive cases, even after Bonferroni correction (eFigs 1 and 2). Systematic genome wide association studies were then conducted with adjustments for age, sex, and the first ten genetic principal components. No significant variants (P < 5x10 -8 ) were identified when comparing participants with any positive Covid-19 test relative to those with no positive test (669 cases and 481,583 controls) or when comparing Covid-19 positive inpatients to positive outpatients (574 cases and 95 controls) (eFigs 3 and 4).

One possible explanation for the sustained increased risk, which we were unable to control for, was the number and duration of social interactions sustained by individuals, an important consideration given the highly contagious nature of Covid-19. This study lends some support to the reported hypothesis that upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a risk factor for Covid-19; however, adjustment for several risk factors reduced the strength of the association. 9,10 Differential effects of medications targeting the angiotensin system in black individuals may partially explain the increased prevalence of Covid-19 in black populations. 11 However, additional data is required to support this conjecture. Finally, the analysis presented herein is one of the first genetic explorations of Covid-19 positive individuals. We identified a novel association in the HLA region, and we confirmed the association of Covid-19 with blood type A. Our findings suggest that genetic drivers of Covid-19 may emerge as additional data is released.",
