Modern genomic technologies have significant potential to advance selective breeding programs; however, they require complete, well annotated tissue-specific transcriptomic and genomic datasets. In addition to assisting in genome assembly and creating linkage maps3, a complete transcriptome provides a potential resource for focussed differential gene-expression studies4, genome annotation5, single nucleotide polymorphism discovery6 and genome scaffolding7.",

Previous research has focussed on hepatopancreas, ovary, heart, muscle and eyestalk tissues8,9, in male and female gonads10, and in response to infection with Vibrio bacterial species capable of inducing acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease11. In addition to such differential gene-expression studies, genomic data from next generation sequencing (NGS) methods has expanded greatly in recent years, particularly in the study of Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei)3,6,12\u201323. Moreover, a transcriptome based on eight tissues was assembled for the less well studied banana shrimp Fenneropenaeus merguiensis24, and genes involved in early embryonic specification have been studied in Marsupenaeus japonicus25. Transcriptomics has also been applied to Penaeus merguiensis26\u201328 and the Chinese white shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis29,30 to investigate aspects of tissue-specific expression, stress tolerance and viral infection. Despite these advances, a comprehensive transcriptome from diverse tissue types and early life-history stages of P. monodon remains unavailable.",

The aim was therefore to generate a highly complete P. monodon transcriptome at the risk of it containing higher levels of transcript redundancy. This was confirmed by BUSCO results which demonstrated the transcriptome to be highly complete (C:98.2%) with low fragmentation (F:0.8%) or missing (M: 1.0%) genes but high levels of duplication (D:51.3%). These assembly statistics are comparable to those obtained by a transcriptome assembly from L. vannamei15 (C:98.0%, F:0.7%, M:1.3%, D:25.5%), but greatly exceeded those of another P. monodon assembly focussing on gonadial tissue recently made available publicly10 (C:33.7%, F:44.9%, M:21.4%, D:6.8%).

The identification was done to help provide initial evidence for transcript roles in specific tissue functions or developmental transitions.

Since the assembly metrics of the L. vannamei transcriptome were similar to those of our P. monodon transcriptome, the low number of shared contigs could stem from considerable differences in transcript type or sequence composition between the two shrimp species.

An important consideration for this type of analysis is the normalized read count cutoff value for each cluster to be considered \u201cunique\u201d, which was arbitrarily set at above 10 in a specific tissue and <10 in all others. At >100 normalized read counts, only approximately half of the assigned unique clusters were retained, indicating that the expression levels of many of these potentially tissue-specific clusters was relatively low. Among the annotated transcript clusters most highly expressed in female gonad tissue were FAMeT, PEPCK, GPx and nasrat. Functional roles these proteins may play range from the shrimp moult cycle and reproduction32, the primary step of gluconeogenesis33, preventing oxidative stress33, to specifying terminal regions of the embryo34. Among the annotated genes expressed most highly in eyestalk tissue was hyperglycaemic hormone (CHH), a key neuropeptide hormone that regulates blood sugar, moulting and reproduction35. A subset of transcript clusters highly expressed in lymphoid organ tissue was also highly expressed in gill tissue, most likely due to high concentrations of haemocytes within both tissue types. The majority of genes expressed most highly in hepatopancreas were annotated, potentially reflecting the shared metabolic functions of this organ with those of other animals. Also of much interest were the non-annotated transcripts expressed uniquely in specific tissue types. For example, transcript clusters expressed highly in male gonad were poorly annotated by both databases and included a large proportion of clusters, annotated or not, expressed exclusively in adult tissue types, indicating that male reproductive organs utilize many genes that remain poorly characterized. The grouping of genes with similar expression patterns broadly categorized these transcript clusters into potential functional groups within each tissue type, thereby guiding the selection for more targeted molecular function analyses.",

Also of significance was the presence of orthologs of the Spaetzle gene, known in Drosophila flies to establish the dorso-ventral patterning of the early embryo36 among transcript clusters detected consistently across later larval and post-larval stages. Since each larval and post-larval stage sequenced comprised a pool of several hundred individuals, quantitative and/or spatial transcript expression patterns would be required to draw further functional conclusions.

Furthermore, arthropod specific pathways were generally better represented. For example, the general circadian rhythm pathway was missing several homologs, while the fly specific circadian rhythm pathway was complete.

It also summarizes the number and nature of specific transcript clusters differentially expressed in different tissue types and larval stages, and the Clusters were functionally annotated and mapped to 235 KEGG pathways. Unique transcript clusters and cluster groups were defined across distinct tissues and early life-history stages, providing initial evidence for their roles in specific tissue functions or developmental transitions. The current transcriptome provides a valuable resource for further investigation of directing gene-function studies to increase basic functional biology knowledge in shrimp and for investigating molecular basis of traits of relevance to the aquaculture of shrimp. While the current transcriptome already provides an improved resource for P. monodon, further effort is required using long-read sequencing data, such as provided by PacBio, to better resolve genes at isoform level. Lastly, this high-quality de novo assembly and data set are publically available and will hopefully support research projects that underpin transformational advances in how we culture shrimp globally.",

Final libraries were again checked using Tapestation DNA 1000 TapeScreen Assay (Agilent). Cluster generation was performed on a cBot with HiSeq PE Cluster Kit v4 - cBot and sequencing was done on a HiSeq 2500 using a HiSeq SBS Kit. The Hiseq 2500 was operating with HiSeq Control Software v2.2.68 and base-calling was performed with RTA v1.18.66.3. Samples in the second sequencing run were pooled and split across two lanes to reduce sequencing bias (Table 1).",

Reads were trimmed harshly for adapters and softly for Phred score <2 using Trimmomatic58 V0.32; and then normalized in silico within Trinity. The normalized forward and reverse reads produced by Trinity were then used in BinPacker59 V1.0, IDBA-Tran60 V 1.1.1 using K20, K30, K40, K50 and K60; and Bridger61 version 2014-12-01.
