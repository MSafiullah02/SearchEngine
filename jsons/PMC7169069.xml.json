On 21 February 2003, a 64\u2010year\u2010old male nephrologist from Guangdong Province took the infection to Hong Kong (HK) where the infection spread to 29 countries/regions within a few weeks by 16 hotel guests and visitors who were infected by the physician. The SARS\u2010CoV international outbreak finally ended in July 2003, with 8096 probable cases and 774 deaths.2 A novel CoV, now classified as a lineage B beta\u2010CoV, was confirmed in March 2003 as the causative agent responsible for SARS\u2010CoV infection.3 A similar variant of SARS\u2010CoV was detected in palm civets in a wild\u2010game animal market located in Shenzhen, indicating that the interface of initial zoonotic transmission to humans were these markets. In 2005, CoV with a high degree of sequence similarity with human or civet cat isolates were detected in Chinese horseshoe bats,4 suggesting that bats were the natural source of SARS\u2010CoV.",

Computer fluid dynamics modelling suggested possible virus dispersion by wind flow, causing long\u2010range airborne transmission (>200 m) to nearby buildings, infecting over 300 residents in a private residential complex in HK.5 The mean incubation period of SARS\u2010CoV infection was 4.6 days (95% CI: 3.8\u20135.8 days), whereas 95% of illness onset was within 10 days. Peaking of nasopharyngeal viral loads in an \u2018inverted v\u2019 shape on day 10 of illness6 was found to correspond temporally to peaking of the extent of consolidation radiographically,7 and a maximal risk of nosocomial transmission, particularly to HCW. A systematic review has identified four aerosol\u2010generating procedures that would increase the risk of nosocomial SARS transmission to HCW, including tracheal intubation, manual ventilation before intubation, tracheotomy and non\u2010invasive ventilation.8 Due to the lack of prospective randomized, placebo\u2010controlled clinical trial (randomized controlled trial, RCT) data, none of the therapies (ribavirin, protease inhibitors, convalescent plasma and interferon) applied in 2003 for the treatment of SARS\u2010CoV infection have well proven benefit. Data from an RCT suggest that systemic corticosteroids given early in the course of SARS\u2010CoV infection might prolong viraemia.9\n",
