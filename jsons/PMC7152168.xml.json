It has become well recognized that infections during pregnancy, in addition to affecting the mother, may affect or be passed to the developing fetus. Infections are caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites that have invaded body tissues or have released toxins disrupting normal functions and eliciting an inflammatory response to help combat the microorganism. Infections, or the inflammatory responses to an infection, can result in adverse effects including preterm delivery, birth defects, developmental delays, or stillbirths.",

A fetus derives half of its genetic material from its father; thus, the fetus is essentially a foreign tissue in the maternal uterine environment. The fetus\u2019 susceptibility to rejection from its mother\u2019s immune system has been compared to an organ transplant (Jamieson et al., 2006). Evidence suggests that the maternal immune system tolerates fetal antigens by suppressing cell-mediated immunity while retaining normal humoral immunity and response (Jamieson et al., 2006). Though only occurring locally at the maternal\u2013fetal interface, this suppression prevents the rejection of the fetal tissue and has been suggested that it may affect maternal response to infection (Jamieson et al., 2006, Erlebacher, 2013). The exact immunological tolerance is not completely understood.",

When shifting to the Th2 cell-mediated response, the Th2-stimulating cytokines dominate and suppress the Th1 T cell responses locally allowing for adequate humoral immune response while the cell-mediated immunity is compromised (Thaxton and Sharma, 2010). Hormonal changes during pregnancy promote this shift from Th1 to Th2.",

These bacteria are capable of hematogenous transmission, similar to the transient bacteremia possible during periodontal infections (Fardini et al., 2010, Han, 2011, Offenbacher et al., 1999). For example, maternal oral infections, like acute gingival infection and chronic periodontal infections, are multifactorial disorders where microbial dental biofilms are considered the primary agent initiating inflammation (Chambrone et al., 2011, Offenbacher et al., 2006, Xiong et al., 2006).

Effects of preterm birth can manifest later in childhood (Huddy et al., 2001). Studies on low birth weight have shown that most of these infants showed sequelae like cognitive defects, academic underachievement, grade failures, and the need for increased remedial assistance during mid-childhood and adolescence continuing during life (Saigal and Doyle, 2008). There is still much about the pathogenesis and mechanisms of preterm birth that is not understood and animal models, such as sheep, have/are being utilized to gain knowledge that could lead to methods and treatments that can improve neonatal outcomes (Racicot et al., 2013, Goldenberg et al., 2008).",

It has been estimated that one of every three preterm neonates is born to a mother with intraamniotic infection, identified with either cultivation or molecular microbiologic techniques (Berger et al., 2009). It is important to also note that microbial colonization of chorioamniotic membranes does not always result in a fetal or maternal inflammatory response (Romero et al., 2007). Chorioamnionitis is typically associated with bacteria that have low virulence and enter the uterus by ascending from the lower reproductive tract; it is rare that transmission is spread hematogenously (one notable exception: Listeria monocytogenes) (Richardson et al., 2010, Tita and Andrews, 2010). The presence of organisms in the amniotic cavity elicits an intense inflammatory response (Racicot et al., 2013). The inflammatory response may intensify and progress into fetal inflammatory response syndrome which predisposes preterm neonates to short- and long-term consequences (Goldenberg et al., 2008).",

Sepsis can begin in utero when the fetus inhales or swallows infected amniotic fluid; during parturition, sepsis is capable of developing within the hours or days after birth when colonized skin or mucosal surfaces are compromised (Polin and Committee on Fetus and Newborn, 2012). Maternal treatment with intrapartum intravenous antimicrobial agents is the only intervention proven to reduce the incidence of early-onset neonatal sepsis (CDC, 2010a, Polin and Committee on Fetus and Newborn, 2012). Late-onset sepsis can result from colonization during birth via vertical transmission of a colonized mother\u2019s anorectal and vaginal areas; case reports have suggested possible horizontal transmission in the postnatal period through breast milk (Berardi et al., 2013, Polin and Committee on Fetus and Newborn, 2012). Depending on the pathogen and the neonatologists\u2019 discretion, a full course of antimicrobials may be used to treat the neonate (Rubin et al., 2002). Vancomycin has been a frequent choice of empiric antimicrobial treatment of neonates with suspected late-onset sepsis (Rubin et al., 2002).",

Emergency cesarean deliveries were frequently reported as urgent or emergent in one study regarding the 2009 H1N1 influenza (Haberg et al., 2013). The unusually high cesarean section delivery is a likely effect of deteriorating maternal condition that impacts the overall fetal status (Mendez-Figueroa et al., 2011). Infants of ill mothers can test positive for H1N1 influenza, but it is an unusual occurrence. This raises the possibility of vertical transmission, but additional studies are needed on the impacts of maternal infection with influenza on neonatal outcomes. Long-term follow-up studies on infants born to women with influenza infection should be performed to fully understand the impacts on overall outcomes when evaluating influenza in pregnancy. Vaccines are available and recommended to pregnant women; see Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2015) for recommendations (CDC, 2015b).",

Transmission of the HBV can occur prenatally when the virus enters the placenta through maternal blood and crosses the placental barrier gaining access to the fetus or during birth when the newborn is exposed to infected cervical secretions. Increased likelihood of intrauterine transmission has been associated with the level of HBV DNA in the mother. Prevention of HBV transmission can be performed by identifying the hepatitis B surface antigen in pregnant women and providing hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine to the infants within 12 h of birth (CDC, 2015f).",

At risk neonates can develop candidiasis, a dermatitis caused by Candida spp. The dermatitis usually resolves on its own in neonates born full-term; however, the condition may advance to candidemia in very low birth weight infants possibly leading to death. Some of the risk factors for dermatitis are vaginal birth, extreme prematurity, low birth weight, hyperglycemia, and steroid administration.",

Stress is common during pregnancy, but high levels may increase the risk of certain problems with delivering a healthy neonate by influencing the already altered immune functions.
