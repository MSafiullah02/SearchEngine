There is a strong correlation between viral bronchiolitis in infants and wheezing later in childhood [3]. However, most children show mild symptoms during viral respiratory infections involving only the nose and upper respiratory passages. Moreover, clinically useful antivirals do not exist for most such viruses and it is thought that for viral respiratory infections it is not necessary to examine the pathogen.",

However, the clinical importance of these findings with regard to symptoms is not known.

RT reactions were performed using a ReverTra Ace qPCR RT kit (Toyobo Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cDNA was then amplified using Realtime PCR Master Mix (Toyobo) with a total volume of 25 \u03bcL. The sensitivity of each of the real-time PCR methods was reported previously [10]. Enteroviruses and rhinoviruses were genotyped by direct sequencing. Amplification of the VP4/VP2 region of the enterovirus or rhinovirus for typing was performed with semi-nested RT-PCR as previously described [11]. The purified PCR products were subjected to direct sequencing with a BigDye Terminator v1.1 kit as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). Sequence analysis was performed using the DNADynamo program (Blue Tractor Software, UK). Using MEGA5.2 (Tamura et al., 2011, Ver5.2.2), we employed the neighbor-joining method [12] to construct phylogenetic trees from the VP4/VP2 region (420 nt) sequences of prototype isolates of each rhinovirus type commonly used in epidemiologic studies of human rhinoviruses retrieved from GenBank [13], [14], [15] and new types proposed previously [13], [16], [17]. Genotypes were assigned on the basis of their clustering with known prototype reference strains.",

            "text": "In this study, separate real-time PCR assays were used to detect 12 RNA viruses and two DNA viruses, and real-time reverse transcription (RT) PCR was used to detect influenza viruses A and B. Of the 512 samples analyzed, 424 were positive 1 virus or more. The overall viral detection rate was 83%, which was much higher than in similar past reports [5], [6], [7], [18]. The reason may be that our method had many detection targets. Furthermore, the higher detection rates among young children likely correspond to the higher incidence of viral respiratory tract infections in children, although other factors such as pre-existing immunity might also have played a role [4]. Since the specimens from children aged 1 year or younger accounted for 68% of those studied, it is considered that the rate of viral detection and the rate of concurrent infections became higher than in past reference data. The largest number of viruses detected in one sample was 5 in the nasal aspirate from a 9-month-old girl. When comparing the number of viruses detected per specimen, it was found that the specimens from younger patients tended to include more than one virus (data not shown).",

Seasonal influenza virus type A migrates globally between epidemics and is reintroduced every winter season in temperate climates [20], although the underlying cause of the seasonality of the other respiratory viruses remains unknown. It has been suggested that rhinovirus infections could reduce subsequent RS virus and influenza virus type A infections by inducing an interferon response, thereby creating an undesirable environment for these viruses [21], [22]. In this study, the peaks for the various viral epidemics did not coincide. Thus, it is thought that some kind of interference by viruses may influence epidemics of respiratory viruses.",

Furthermore, the detected rhinoviruses consisted of 32 genotypes of group A, 5 genotypes of group B and 21 genotypes of group C, suggesting that multiple genotypes were brought into the area and that epidemics of some of them might occur at the same time (Supplementary Table 1). Rhinovirus A consists of 80 serotypes and B consists of 32 types, including genotypes, and there are now 55 rhinovirus C genotypes proposed [17].

The results revealed that there were no significant differences in the number of days of hospitalization, the necessity for oxygen inhalation or the existence of wheezing between the children with single infections and those with dual infections. In former reports that evaluated the impacts of rhinoviruses on lower respiratory infections, there were only marginal differences between the different rhinovirus groups and between single rhinovirus infection and rhinovirus coinfection [26], [27]. Though there was no significant difference in the number of hospitalization days of patients with single infections by rhinoviruses or other respiratory viruses, our data suggested the importance of rhinoviruses as a potential cause of pediatric pneumonia. Recently, our group evaluated the prevalence of rhinovirus infections among asymptomatic children [10]. Rhinoviruses were often detected in their throats at a time without any symptoms. Since rhinoviruses do not exist in the upper respiratory tract for a long time even if a child does not show symptoms, these were \u201cactive\u201d asymptomatic infections rather than persistent infections.",
