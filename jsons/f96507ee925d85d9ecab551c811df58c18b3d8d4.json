A retrospective study showed that corticosteroid treatment lowers the incidence of MI during the hospital stay. No data exist so far on the effect of corticosteroids on myocardial injury in CAP patients. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate if methylprednisolone is able to reduce myocardial injury, as assessed by serum high-sensitivity cardiac T Troponin (hs-cTnT), in a cohort of patients hospitalized for CAP. Secondary aims are to evaluate the potential effect of methylprednisolone on cardiovascular events during hospitalization, at 30 days from hospital admission and during 2 years' follow-up. The trial will also examine whether the potential protective effects of methylprednisolone might be due to platelet activation down-regulation. Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. One hundred twenty-two eligible patients will be randomized to a week treatment with iv methylprednisolone (20 mg b.i.d) or placebo from hospital admission. Serum hs-cTnT will be measured at admission and every day until up 3 days from admission. ECG will be monitored every day until discharge. After discharge, all patients will be followed-up 2 years. This is the first clinical trial aimed at examining whether methylprednisolone treatment may reduce myocardial injury. The results of this trial may constitute the basis for conducting a larger multicenter trial aimed to evaluate the effect of corticosteroid on cardiovascular events in this setting.",

The overarching rationale is that glucocorticoids could mitigate exaggerated and potentially deleterious aspects of the host's inflammatory response. Corticosteroids have typically been prescribed to target the acute phase of these conditions. However, the results of these studies have been mixed. For example, a meta-analysis of more than 30 trials in septic shock suggested that glucocorticoids reduce the duration of septic shock and may reduce mortality [19] . However, a meta-analysis of trials in pneumonia [20] , the most common cause of sepsis, reported significant heterogeneity in terms of both patient characteristics and type of glucocorticoids used and found an uncertain effect on mortality but consistent reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation, length of hospitalization, and time to clinical stability. Consequently, the efficacy of glucocorticoids remains unclear, treatment guidelines can be controversial [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , and clinicians continue to struggle with decisions regarding optimal approaches. Recently, a precision medicine approach showed that the acute use of methylprednisolone decreased treatment failure among patients with CAP and an exaggerated immune response as evidenced by high circulating C-reactive protein levels [26] .",

The underlying mechanism seems to be dependent upon corticosteroid's ability to impair arachidonic release from platelet membrane via PLA2 downregulation and ensuing reduced TxB2 biosynthesis [15] .
