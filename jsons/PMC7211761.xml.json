            "text": "Coronavirus (CoV) is a genus of the Coronaviridae family named for the crown-like spikes found on their surface. They are a huge family of viruses containing a genome composed of a long RNA strands which is the largest of all RNA viruses, and this genome acts like a messenger RNA when it infects a cell, and directs the synthesis of two long polyproteins that include the machinery that the virus needs to replicate new viruses. A novel betacoronavirus from the subgenus Sarbecovirus has been isolated from human airway epithelial cells [[1], [2], [3]]. Protease inhibitors could likely block a key enzyme that helps viruses replicate and prevents SARS, which is also a coronavirus [4]. There is some information about doctors administering HIV drugs for treating COVID-19 patients, but no solidly positive results. Anti-malarials have also been tested with little evidence for effectiveness. If the virus attacks immunocompromised patients, they will be at risk, and neither HIV retrovirals nor plant-based products are therapeutic [5]. Naturally occurring phyto-chemically based compounds have been shown to exhibit several anti-viral effects including other pharmacological properties [6]. The genome of novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) encodes many important proteins for its replication in the host genome viz. the nucleocapsid protein, Spike (S) protein, Envelope (E) protein, Membrane (M) protein and coronavirus main protease, which play crucial roles in gene expression, and cleave polyproteins into replication-related proteins [7,8]. With this in mind, the present in silico study was designed to evaluate the effects of FDA approved anti-viral drugs and plant-based antiviral agent on the COVID-19 main protease viral protein of SARS-COV-2. (see Fig. 7)",

The complexes bound to the protein receptor molecule were removed. The protein preparation wizard from the Schr\u00f6dinger module was used to prepare the structure of the main protease on adding the hydrogen atoms, removing the waters beyond 5 \u00c5 of the binding site, and the active site grid was generated using the Receptor grid generation application in Glide module. Glide uses a filter search to locate the ligand in the active-site region of the receptor. The shape and properties of the receptor are represented on a grid that provides a more accurate scoring of the ligand poses. The grid of 20 \u00c5 was generated over the co-crystallized ligand inhibitor molecule. The docked complexes were superimposed to the original crystal structure to calculate the root mean square deviation (RMSD) using pyMOL.",

The HTVS mode identified active compounds for screening, and ligands with different conformations were screened and false positives eliminated. The LigPrep program produced results for 1,129 ligand conformations of FDA approved antiviral drugs, 459 of anti-malarial drugs, and 110 of plant-based drugs. The stereo conformer per each ligand which showed the lowest energy with the receptor has been selected for further docking study under SP (Standard Precision) mode of Glide. The Protein-ligand interaction of the stable docked Lopinavir, Amodiaquine, and Theaflavin digallate with main protease complex was visualized with ligand interaction. Lower RMSD values of PyMOL superimposed docked complexes with respect to initial structure before docking indicates that our complexes are stable (Fig. 1b). Lopinavir showed interactions of hydrogen bond interactions with Glu 166, GLN 189, GLY 143 and pi -pi stacking with His 41 (Fig. 2\na and b) and was successfully docked with a best docking score of \u22129.918, glide energy \u22128.023, and glide e-model \u221276.898 (Table 1\n). Theaflavin digallate showed interactions of hydrogen bond interactions with THR 26, ASB 142, HIS 41, HIS 163, GLU166, GLN 189 (Fig. 3\na and b) docked with a best docking score of --10.574, glide G-SCORE -10.722 and glide e-model \u2212135.584 (Table 2\n). The ligand amodiaquine shares four hydrogen bond interactions with Leu 141, ARG 187 and salt bridge interaction with Glu 166, whereas pi-pi stacking with His 41 (Fig. 4\na and b) of the active site residues of main protease and the docked complex orientation exhibited a docking score of \u22127.421, glide g-score of \u22128.023, and glide e-model \u221276.898 (Table 3\n). The LIGPLOT 2D interaction showed the interacting residue information. The results produced from docking showed the antimalarial drug and Theaflavin digallate. Hence, from in silico approach, the study suggests that the US FDA approved drugs Lopinavir, Amodiaquine, and Theaflavin digallate may be tested in vivo as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 (see Fig. 5).",

The structure variation was calculated by RMSD values of protein-ligand complexes from 0 to 20 ns. The RMSD values steadily increased from 0 to 5 ns, and reached stable state throughout the simulation. The average RMSD values of amodiquine, lopinavir, and theaflavin digallate were found to be 0.25, 0.23, and 0.22 nm, respectively. RMSF provides the fluctuation of each atom in the overall simulation (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7\na\n). RMSF was calculated for protease with 306 amino acids and three potential drug candidates; the values confirmed that the binding site residues showed less fluctuation. The average RMSF values were 0.15, 0.17, and 0.2 nm for amodiquine, lopinavir, and theaflavin digallate, respectively (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7b). The radius of gyration (Rg) of the protein and ligand complexes was found to be between 2.13 and 2.18 nm initially. The Rg values of the main protease with amaodiquine was stabilized after 5 ns and in case of lopinavir and theaflavin digallate, the values were decreased initially and stabilized from 5 to 20 ns which was an indicator for a stable binding pose (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7c). The MD simulation analysis of selective docked complexes confirmed the stability of protein ligand complexes. Dayer et al. (2017) conducted 50ns MD simulations on HIV-1 protease and inhibitors complex and they found that lopinavir was possible drug candidate with a significant binding energy value [10]. Nukoolkarn et al. (2008) performed 2ns MD simulations with main protease and inhibitor complexes (ritronavir and lopinavir) and reported that the ligand-binding site of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro (main protease) was around active sites of H41 and C145 [11]. Similarly, in the present study, we found that the active site of H41 was sharing hydrogen bonds with all three proposed inhibitors (see Fig. 6).",

Identification of natural and existing approved drugs is a noteworthy step for early drug discovery against COVID\u201019. Based on the observations of docking score, we believed that the phenol derivative and anti-HIV drug, could aid in COVID\u201019 drug discovery. The RMSD of three complexes fall between 0.15 and 0.25 nm and inferred that the compounds lopinavir, amodiquine, and theaflavin digallate had undergone good conformational changes while binding, and maintained close affinity with the binding site of the main protease. However, in vitro and in vivo evaluation study is required to repurpose these three drugs against 2019-nCoV.",
