This was the first demonstration that a vaccine could successfully eradicate viruses causing disorders and diseases that even when not lethal, still had the potential to cripple both surviving populations and their surrounding geographical economies. Since that time, the occurrence of epidemics and outbreaks are now at lower risk, following the introduction of massive vaccination programs able to induce immune system targeting of viruses causing severe disorders affecting distinct geographical locations, and with many epidemiological reports demonstrating long-term efficacy of viral control of non-na\u00efve populations.",

Some can be predicted annually, while others may see decades between outbreaks, therefore driving the continuous epidemiological surveillance of associated infectious disorders, the development and implementation of targeting vaccines, and development of immune-monitoring strategies measuring vaccine efficiency in target populations. Despite vaccination-mediated protection of numerous nations documenting complete eradication of the causative agents of viral disorders in endemic populations, there is threat of re-emergence of pandemic proportions of these agents. Threats to virus re-emergence are caused by contemporary choices made to not vaccinate children, by strain recombination, by viral spread to na\u00efve populations by world-travelers, migrants, or climate change, causing redistribution of viral vectors, by potential use of these agents in acts of bioterrorism or war upheaval, or by depletion of vaccination stocks required for protection against pandemics. Other factors include the increasing and aging global population and increased number of immunocompromised individuals\u2014factors strongly supporting the maintenance of herd immunity against existing viruses, despite lower incidence of outbreaks in industrialized countries. In the event of a re-emergence of previously eradicated viruses or the acquisition of increased pathogenicity by existing viral strains, there is an urgent need for vaccine development strategies that can rapidly and effectively arrest global spread.",

            "text": "Important advances are continuously being made in vaccine development strategies toward the control of viruses and associated disorders. Vaccine design has been modified from the use of attenuated viruses to use of more precise viral protein subunits specifically targeted by T cells. Historically, vaccination immunogenicity was documented by measures of serum immunoglobulin (Ig) classes and antigen-specific antibodies produced by humoral immunity. More recently, quantification of cellular components of innate immunity at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity are made, in addition to more precise measurements of adaptive immunity. Long-term protection achieved by adaptive immunity can be quantified by measuring levels of circulating cytokines, along with specific phenotypic profiles of effector memory, antigen-specific T cells. Though both humoral and cellular arms of immunity are integrally linked during the initial induction of immunity against pathogens, these can become disconnected with developing pathology due to their individual needs for survival factors, unequal declines in immune function, and differential cellular lifespans. This loss of correlation between memory T cells and neutralizing antibody responses varies according to different viruses, suggesting that independent time course measures of these separate immune responses are required over time for adequate recording of biomarkers of natural infection and vaccine efficacy or suggesting that T cell status may be most crucial measure of conferred long-term immunity.",

The features of viruses and associated disorders that we herein describe include viral genetics and replication cycles, transmission modalities, cell and organ tropism, host-immune evasion strategies, associated viral disorders and diseases, and epidemiology. We also report on well-accepted and other important documented instances of viral control by T cells, currently available and successful vaccines, and recorded measures of vaccination immunogenicity. We focus on quantification of vaccine-induced effector memory T cell\u2013mediated immunity, representing the gold standard of successful vaccination.

Type A influenza viruses can be further sub-subtyped by the antigenicity of their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface glycoproteins (GPs). Antigenic drift, caused by point mutations in HA and NA and recombination of the HA genes, results in the generation of new strains that can escape pre-existing immunity, causing both the prediction of circulating strains difficult and antigenic mismatch by existing vaccines. Approximately 18 HA and 9 NA subtypes of influenza A are documented in aquatic birds, representing their natural hosts (i.e., vectors). Influenza A H1 and H3 subtypes cocirculate seasonally, and Influenza B viruses can only infect humans, via two distinct, seasonally cocirculating, lineages. Type C influenza viruses are more rarely documented to infect humans and pigs (Berlanda Scorza et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Epithelial cells that are infected with influenza virus produce inflammatory cytokines acting as chemoattractants for homing macrophages and dendritic cells (DC). DCs take up influenza viral particles to trigger their maturation and pursuant migration to the lymph, where they initiate antigen-specific T cell maturation. These influenza-specific effector T cells then enter the respiratory tract to counteract viral titres through cytokine expression and the direct lysis of infected cells, with activated CD8+ effector cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) representing the main constituents of this response by their release of perforins and granzymes, and the engagement of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors (Spitaels et al., 2016). Influenza-specific CD4+ T helper cells can act directly and indirectly in viral clearance, primarily by producing cytokines that induce the functions of B cells and CD8+ T cells and which have also been reported to directly eliminate infected cells themselves (Topham, Doherty, 1998, Hua et al., 2013). While pre-existing CD8+ T cell immunity has not yet been demonstrated to prevent infection from occurring, it is hypothesized to be the result of the loss of granzyme expression by memory CD8+ T cells and populations of IAV-specific CD8+ T cells are still importantly correlated with the control of spread and recovery in healthy populations (Grant et al., 2016). The most currently administered influenza vaccines are inactivated (IV) trivalent (TIV) or quadrivalent formulations containing equal amounts of HA of two influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and one of two influenza B strains (Yamagata and Victoria lineage). These are derived from viruses typically grown in fertilized chicken eggs, are mainly focused on eliciting a strain-matched humoral immune response\u2014requiring yearly updates\u2014and are unable to provide protection to all vaccinated individuals. The requirement of memory T cell immunity for long-term protection against influenza virus promotes the development of vaccines that elicit both humoral and cellular immunity: a strategy expected to overcome the inadequacies of current vaccines against influenza and other viruses (Spitaels et al., 2016). There is broad interest in the development of a universal influenza vaccine, considered to be the \u201choly grail\u201d of influenza vaccine research. This approach is being developed to use virus-infected cell-killing antibodies that produce an antiviral environment; these termed antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)-mediating antibodies, which are predicted to link innate and adaptive immune responses, and is becoming possible due to new technologies for rapid isolation and characterization of monoclonal antibodies targeting conserved regions of influenza virus, reviewed in Jegaskanda et al. (2017). This approach has been postulated to work, in part, from reports of IAV-specific CD8+ T cells, promoting viral clearance in the absence of neutralizing antibodies, and can also mediate cross-reactive immunity against distinct IAVs to drive a rapid recovery from severe influenza disorders (Grant et al., 2016). The induction of infection-permissive immunity is both protective and allows virus-induced cross-reactive immune responses. Vaccines targeting the conserved ectodomain of M2 deliver this kind of non-neutralizing immunity since these antibodies rely on Fc receptors and innate immune components (El Bakkouri et al., 2011). Antagonizing antibodies inhibiting NA activity represents another promising strategy, not by blocking viral entry and eliciting sterilizing immunity, but by contributing to immunity against a virus possessing a similar NA type (Wan et al., 2013). There is also progress being made in the development of recombinant T cell\u2013inducing vaccines, with the most advanced version of this strategy demonstrated by Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) viruses expressing influenza virus NP and M1 antigens (Berthoud et al., 2011), with vaccinated individuals demonstrating increases in interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) expressing CD8+ T cells and increased protection against influenza infection (Antrobus et al., 2012, Powell et al., 2013). Co-administration of this MVA-based vaccine with TIV formulations results in increased influenza strain\u2013specific antibody responses and the generation of memory T cells that recognize a range of influenza A subtypes (Antrobus et al., 2014). Additional research demonstrates production of antigen-specific T cell responses using alternate prime/boost regiments of combinations of vaccination regimens employing recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus or MVA, expressing IAV NP and matrix protein 1 (Lambe et al., 2013). Quality and clonal T cell receptor (TCR) characteristics of influenza-specific CD8+ T cells, in addition to in silico predicted and peptide-based approaches for pools of minimal IAV epitopes, are investigated for their induction of cellular immunity and recognition by CD8+ T cells (reviewed in Grant et al., 2016).",

Second, only to human respiratory syncytial virus, HPIVs are the major contributors to hospitalization due to ALRIs and global pneumonia mortalities in young children, and up to 80% of children are seropositive for HPIVs by the age of 5 years (Murphy, 1988, Weinberg et al., 2009). HPIV infections can induce potent humoral and cellular immune responses, including innate immune responses, local and systemic IgG and IgA responses, and adaptive CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses (Gitlin et al., 2010, Hou et al., 1992). Though cellular responses can restrict HPIV replication dynamics and clear primary infections, neutralizing antibodies against virus envelope hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) GPs are required for early infection (Suzuki et al., 2001, Zhang et al., 2005) and confer long-term protection against HPIV-related disorders (Murphy, 1988, Spriggs et al., 1987, Schmidt et al., 2011). Currently, there is no vaccine to protect against human HPIV infection. Progress in the development of HPIV vaccines using reverse genetics for serotypes \u22121 to \u22123 has generated several live-attenuated, intranasal HPIV vaccines evaluation in adults and in children, two of which, HPIV-3 are well tolerated in HPIV3-seronegative pediatric populations (Schmidt et al., 2011). Ongoing pediatric trials testing live-attenuated HPIV vaccines for HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 predict these will replicate in the upper respiratory tract of infants to induce the full spectrum of humoral and cellular immune responses (Karron et al., 2015). Heterologous (i.e., Jennerian) vaccine design strategies using the Sendai virus (SeV) to control infections by HPIVs and RSV are discussed in the following section.\n",

            "text": "A balance of adaptive immune CTLs and neutralizing antibodies of the humoral immune response mediate protection and clearance of RSV infection (Griffiths et al., 2017). Though neutrophils are the highest proportion of leukocytes found in the airways of those infected with RSV (Everard et al., 1994), and despite observations that natural killer (NK) cells are first to attain infected airways (Hussell and Openshaw, 1998), it is CD4+ helper and CD8+ CTLs that correlate with the early clearance of RSV-infected cells (Anderson et al., 1990). In infants and immunocompromised populations, fatalities resulting from RSV infection are associated with deficiencies in CD4+ and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (Hall et al., 1986, Welliver et al., 2008). Later in infection, increases in neutralizing antibodies prevent reinfection by opsonizing viral epitopes required for RSV entry and infection, and RSV clearance can be associated with RSV-neutralizing nasal Immunoglobulin A (IgA) (Mcintosh et al., 1978). More recently, enhanced RSV clearance with reduced disease severity has been associated with vaccine-elicited memory CD8+ T cells (Lee et al., 2012). While memory CD8+ T cells can mediate protection against RSV infection, in the absence of antibodies and memory CD4+ T cells, these cause mortality via systemic proinflammatory cytokine storms and local IFN-\u03b3 production (Stoley et al., 2016, Schmidt et al., 2018). Other recent studies however indicate that the CD8+ T cell response may not be the major determinant of severity of RSV-related pathology (Collins and Melero, 2011).\n",

SeV-based vaccines have proven to be effective toward inducing B cell and T cell immune responses, and in the protection from HPIV-1, -2, and -3, and RSV, where they can also be used in combination with other vaccines to prime\u2013boosts or to target one or more than one paramyxovirus pathogen (Russell and Hurwitz, 2016). SeV is attractive for use in human vaccination because it is a murine pathogen unable to infect humans (Bousse et al., 2006) and therefore does not require attenuation as it can never revert to a human pathogenic phenotype (Schickli et al., 2012). Another important feature supporting the use of SeV as a pan-virus vaccination agent stems from its ability to grow transiently in mammalian cells, accommodating the endogenous expression of antigens with posttranslational modifications matching those of the target antigens and neutralizing epitopes (Henrickson et al., 1991), with endogenous expression of antigens ensuring robust activation of CD8+ T cells able to destroy antigen-producing cells and terminate virus amplification (York, Rock, 1996, Russell, Hurwitz, 2016). In murine studies, SeV could elicit rapid and durable respiratory mucosa and systemic HPIV-specific B cell and T cell responses (Sealy et al., 2010, Rudraraju et al., 2011). Clinical testing of human populations infected with RSV and HPIVs is underway (Adderson et al., 2015). For a full review of current development of antiviral compounds and vaccine candidates tested against RSV, see Costello et al., 2012.",

Recombination between HAdVs are largely responsible for outbreaks of acute febrile respiratory disease in immunocompetent military recruits, where serotypes 4 and type 7 have been documented to account for approximately 60% of these respiratory illnesses (Hilleman et al., 1957, Dudding et al., 1973), and are associated to other frequently occurring disorders including upper and lower respiratory illnesses, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, keratoconjunctivitis, meningoencephalitis, cystitis, and myocarditis in these immunocompetent populations, reviewed in Lion (2014).

(2003). Histopathological changes resulting from infection can be divided into two phases: The first phase of immune histopathology predominantly involves nonspecific, cytokine-mediated inflammatory recruitment of monocytes and macrophages, while the second phase involves T cell infiltration (Prince et al., 1993). T cell\u2013mediated immunity is believed to be required for HadV recovery from acute infections, and individuals lacking adaptive immunity are found to be at elevated risk of infection, with CD8+ T cells as primary mediators of response to respiratory viruses, with relatively little contribution by CD4+ cells (Woodland et al., 2001). However, following adenovirus exposure, CD4+ T cells have been shown to be responsible for increasing proliferation status of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and CD4+ T cells represent the major CTL subsets produced and recognize conserved antigens across adenovirus serotypes (Flomenberg et al., 1995, Regn et al., 2001). Adenoviruses have, however, evolved several host-evasion strategies, including inhibition of apoptosis, responses to IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression (Mahr, Gooding, 1999, Wold et al., 1994, Wold et al., 1999).",

RV also represents a significant cause of disease in industrialized countries, with greater numbers of hospital admissions reported relative to developing countries (Chang et al., 2003). Though Group A RV causes the majority of endemic infections and can also lead to significant outbreaks in infant and geriatric populations (Villena et al., 2003, Marshall et al., 2003), group B RVs are less common but can also lead to outbreaks and epidemics (Sanekata et al., 2003, Ahmed et al., 2004), whereas group C RV is less often observed causing sporadic diseases. Of the existing 10 G and eight P RV group A serotypes, G1 to 4, P[4] and P[8] are the most commonly observed, with G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], and G4P[8] being the most common combinations recorded (Kostouros et al., 2003, Clark and Mckendrick, 2004).",

            "text": "Two live attenuated RV vaccines, Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline) and RotaTeq (Merck), are licensed for global administration to pediatric populations. Rotarix contains a single G1P[8] human RV strain, whereas RotaTeq contains five RV strains, G1P7[5], G2P7[5], G3P7[5], G4P7[5], and G6P1A[8] (Yen et al., 2014). As in the case of natural neonatal RV infection, fair protection rates are achieved via humoral immunity using these vaccines. Though these are unable to protect against RV reinfection, they do offer protection against severe associated clinical symptoms causing patient hospitalization. These vaccines offer both homotypic and heterotypic immunity, and protection often correlates with increases in RV type\u2013specific IgG or IgA antibodies, reviewed in Desselberger and Huppertz (2011). Although RV vaccine\u2013induced humoral immunity substantially decreases disease burden, these vaccination strategies are less effective and difficult to implement in low-income countries requiring them most (Patel et al., 2012). As with natural RV infection, vaccines provide nonsterilizing immunity to children (Angel et al., 2007), where lack of establishment of long-term immunity against RV causes half of children's guardians to be at risk of becoming infected and presenting with severe associated disorders (Rodriguez et al., 1987). This further demonstrates that RV-specific T (RV-T) cells are crucial for the development of overall, long-term, protective immunity against RV (Franco et al., 2006, Offit et al., 1993). Indeed, in models of RV infection, vaccine-induced protective immune responses are dependent on antiviral cytokine production and by direct killing of RV-infected cells by T cell and B cell adaptive immune subsets (Jiang et al., 2008, Wen et al., 2016). In addition, with observations that gut CD4+ T cells may become tolerogenic or anergic in response to RV infection, stimulating T cells with RV antigen in the presence of IL-2, IL-12, or R59949, a pharmacological diacylglycerol kinase alpha inhibitor, causes increased PBMC frequencies of RV antigen-specific T effector cells, including RV-CD4+ TNF-\u03b1+, RV-CD4+ IFN-\u03b3+, and RV-CD8+ IFN-\u03b3+ cells (Parra et al., 2014).",

Children with low plasma Ig may recover from MeV infection, while those with defects in cellular immunity develop progressive infections (Albertyn et al., 2011, Mcquaid et al., 1998). MeV-specific antibody and T cell responses coincide with the onset of the rash, whereby rash biopsies of MeV-replicating, infected epithelial cells, have high levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltrates (Polack et al., 1999). CD8+ T cell subsets appear to be particularly important for control and clearance of infectious MeV, where expanded circulating virus-specific CTLs are found in the blood of patients suffering rash, and increases in CD8+ T cells are also found in MeV-induced pneumonias (Jaye et al., 1998, Mongkolsapaya et al., 1999, Myou et al., 1993). In addition, depending on the target tissue and cell type analyzed with regards to MeV infection, though differentially rated, both cytotoxicity and IFN production have been implicated as key effector mechanisms for MeV clearance (Patterson et al., 2002, Stubblefield Park et al., 2011, Finke et al., 1995), with specific combinations of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells recorded as required for the control of primary MeV infection (Tishon et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Protection against measles is based on MeV-specific humoral, antibody-based, immunity. Diagnostically, the current gold standard of protection is via quantification of neutralizing antibodies against the viral hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) surface GPs (Bouche et al., 2002, Haralambieva et al., 2011, Plotkin, 2010). MeV, however, triggers an aggressive immune response, involving both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system (Moss, Griffin, 2012, De Vries et al., 2012, Buchanan, Bonthius, 2012). Once measles has been cleared, it is memory T cells that can provide lifelong immunity against reinfection by MeV (Bester, 2016). Importantly, during MeV infection, immune reactions to other pathogens are suppressed from weeks to years, leading to risk and susceptibility to secondary infections, and which is believed to be a driver of complications and mortality long after measles had been cleared. Conversely, this measles-induced immune \u201camnesia,\u201d sometimes disabling immune memory for up to 3 years, has been suggested to work toward herd protection against other infections and is supported by the association of measles vaccination with lowered mortality rates from other childhood infections (Mina et al., 2015). Occasional spontaneous tumor regressions have also been observed to occur during natural measles infection, suggesting that MeV infection may be adopted in the generation of safe and effective oncolytic viruses (Russell and Peng, 2009).",

            "text": "Once measles is cleared, memory T cells can provide lifelong immunity to MeV (Bester, 2016), and distinct patterns of cellular immunity to rubella virus are observed and related to the time elapsed following vaccination (Lambert et al., 2015). Predominant biomarkers of early cellular measles immunity are characterized by an immunosuppressive phenotype, with increases in IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 and decreases in IFN-\u03b3 and proliferative properties of circulating peripheral lymphocytes (Pukhalsky et al., 2003). Late immunity is shifted to predominantly proinflammatory cytokine profiles via increased concentrations of IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and TNF-\u03b1, in combination with decreases in IL-10 (Dhiman et al., 2010). Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), known to play critical roles in immune response to viruses, contribute to the heterogeneity of the immune response to rubella virus as a result of their polymorphic nature, whereby HLA class I and II polymorphisms restrict the available repertoire of rubella antigens presented to T cells and therefore influence the subsequent immune response (Mitchell et al., 1996, Ou et al., 1994, Ou et al., 1998). Current efforts are placed on deciphering the immunogenetics of antirubella humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, with a focus on better understanding HLA polymorphisms toward the development of vaccine candidates that utilize constructs comprised of HLA-specific epitopes that can induce immunity across heterogenetic populations, reviewed in Lambert et al. (2015). Both natural infection and vaccines induce humoral and cellular immune responses conferring protection against rubella (Tosh et al., 2009). While humoral responses have been conventionally used to measure and record protective immunity in human populations, cellular immune responses are intrinsic to humoral immunity (Bautista-Lopez et al., 2000, Horstmann et al., 1985, Ovsyannikova et al., 2004, Nepom et al., 1997, Vesikari et al., 1975, Akaboshi et al., 2001, Farzaneh et al., 2003).",

Humans are its only vector (Hambleton and Gershon, 2005), where it specifically infects T cells, epithelial cells, and ganglia (Gershon et al., 2015). VZV viruses have diameters measuring up to 200 nm and are encoded by a linear double-stranded DNA genome consisting of approximately 125 kb and encoding at least 70 unique genes, with all but the exception of 6, having homologs in herpes simplex virus (Cohen, 2010). VZV virions are composed of the viral DNA, the capsid, the tegument surrounding the capsid, and the envelope surrounding the tegument and which incorporates the major viral GPs (Arvin, 1996). During lytic infection phases, VZV produces at least 12 GPs expressed on both virions and human cell surfaces. During this process, and which is common to other herpesviruses, gene expression is believed to proceed in an orderly cascade of immediate early genes, early genes, and late genes. During latent VZV infection, gene expression is restricted until reactivation for additional rounds of lytic infection (Gershon and Gershon, 2010).",

Primary VZV infection causes varicella, also commonly known as chickenpox. As cellular immunity to VZV wanes in the elderly and immunocompromised populations, latent VZV becomes reactivated and causes zoster (i.e., shingles, herpes zoster), which is usually associated with chronic pain but also numerous other serious neurological and ocular disorders, as well as multiple visceral and gastrointestinal disorders, including ulcers, hepatitis, and pancreatitis (Gershon et al., 2015, Gilden et al., 2010).

Although it can often be a self-limiting disease, varicella can also result in death, where in developed countries, an estimated 5 of 1000 patients are hospitalized with serious complications, with up to three deaths per 100,000 patients (Galil et al., 2002, Rawson et al., 2001). Complications from varicella requiring hospitalization include bacterial superinfections of the skin, blood, bones, and lungs, as well as encephalitis and hemorrhagic manifestations in pediatric and immunocompromised populations (Gershon et al., 2015). Importantly, acquiring VZV during early pregnancy often results in severe congenital defects in 1% of newborns (Enders, 1984). VZV is a great example of success through herd vaccination programs for children, dramatically influencing its epidemiology, and causing 95% declines of hospitalization cases in the United States (Gershon et al., 2015).",

VZV can be propagated to T cell\u2013rich regional lymph nodes for rapid proliferation and is then disseminated by the circulation to infect dermis, epidermis, and other organs (Ku et al., 2002, Ku et al., 2004). Lymphopenia is typically observed in patients during viral incubation, followed by an increase in leukocyte counts, correlating with the onset of rash until the resolution of viremia. During infection, VZV can be recovered from PBMCs in children exhibiting rash (Ozaki et al., 1984, Koropchak et al., 1992, Sawyer et al., 1992), is extensively observed in thymic lymphocytes (Levin, 2014), and observed in all T cell subsets examined (Moffat et al., 1995). Though innate skin immunity can cause delays in multiplication of skin-bound VZV while the adaptive immune system mounts an attack, however, aggressive VZV replication in the skin results in characteristic varicella rash (Ku et al., 2004). High VZV titre-skin vesicles from rash provide cell-free virus for person-to-person transmission (Chen et al., 2004). VZV also latently infects neurons of cranial nerve ganglia, dorsal root ganglia, and enteric and autonomic ganglia (Gershon and Gershon, 2010). VZV reactivation causes ganglia to become necrotic and hemorrhagic (Head et al., 1997), with VZV proteins found in neurons and non-neuronal cells, and where this VZV-induced ganglionitis is often also marked by the upregulation of MHC class I and II proteins associated infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Schmidbauer et al., 1992, Steain et al., 2014, Gowrishankar et al., 2010).\n",

ZVL is licensed in over 55 countries, with 34 million distributed doses globally (Willis et al., 2017), and which has associated efficacy rates of over 50% in all ages tested (Oxman et al., 2005, Schmader et al., 2012); consistent with original clinical trial datasets (Tseng et al., 2011, Langan et al., 2013, Marin et al., 2015).

Importantly, it was later discovered that providing two doses to children resulted in higher IgG antibody titres and increased T cell proliferation and where experimental evidence suggesting that memory responses were sustained more effectively from such regimens (Watson, 2008). These observations led to the more recent recommendation of implementing of a two-dose regimen of varicella vaccine for all vaccine recipients (Arvin, 2008). Studies of how regimens affect long-term protection by the adaptive T cell immune response to vaccination, as exemplified by VZV vaccination studies, have the potential to modify dosages and timelines to maximize overall and persisting beneficial long-term effects from vaccination against many other viruses.",

The first generation VACV/VARV vaccines produced in the 1970s and 1980s (Dryvax, Apsv, Lancy\u2013Vaxina, L-IVP) contained live VACV (Kennedy et al., 2009), and induced robust humoral immunity is characterized by high antibody titers, neutralizing and opsonizing viral particles, fixing complement, hemagglutination, and antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (Amanna et al., 2006, Panchanathan et al., 2008). These vaccines have since been observed to generate adaptive immune responses over many concentrations (Frey et al., 2002, Rock et al., 2006), including the secretion of effector cytokines (e.g., IFN-\u03b3) and the lysing of infected cells (Amanna et al., 2006, Hammarlund et al., 2003). Most second-generation vaccines created for biodefense contain replication competent viruses (Artenstein and Grabenstein, 2008) and have comparable efficacies to Dryvax. Third-generation vaccine formulations using attenuated VACV strains (LC16m8, Mva, Nyvac, dVVL) have increased safety profiles (Artenstein, 2008, Kennedy et al., 2009). Proof that adaptive cellular immunity is essential in preventing the spread of VARV following immunization and in its generating overall protective immunity against smallpox comes from observations that individuals having T cell\u2013deficiency disorders suffered serious and sometimes fatal infections after vaccination, but that agammaglobulinemic children were not at risk of these adverse complications (Rock et al., 2006).",

CD4+ T cell epitopes are from late viral products including membrane, structural proteins, and replicative enzymes (Jing et al., 2008), and linkage of B cell and CD4+ T cell epitopes to VARV proteins suggests T helper cell\u2013B cell interactions are those required for generation of robust VACV-specific antibody responses (Sette et al., 2008). In humans, VARV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been observed to persist for over 75 years following immunization (Rock et al., 2006).",

MeV is transmitted via human respiratory routes, and despite vaccine availability, still causes 10% of African children mortalities, and severe risk of SSPE-derived fatalities years later in survivors. Historically, in common with many other viruses, the gold standard diagnostic of protection is made by quantification of humoral neutralizing antibodies. Adaptive cellular immune responses are, however, those most critical for MeV clearance, where MeV-specific T cell responses coincide with rashes densely infiltrated by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Combinations of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells control primary infection, where CD8+ T cells dominate for control and clearance, and memory T cells are able to provide lifelong protection. MeV infection induces general long-term immunosuppression leading to vulnerability to other pathogens causing secondary infections, but this immunosuppression is believed, by some, to be simultaneously conferring herd protection and have been observed to induce spontaneous tumor regression.",

HBV surface antigen HBsAg-specific antibodies are induced by infection and immunization with the recombinant protein and have virus-neutralizing activity conferring protective immunity (Guidotti and Chisari, 2006). HCV-specific antibodies produced after infection do not offer long-term protection as these do not persist, are subject to loss of neutralizing activity from virus mutation, and are ineffective for cell-to-cell HCV transmission (Takaki et al., 2000, Dowd et al., 2009, Timpe et al., 2008).",

            "text": "T cells play critical roles during acute HCV and HBV infections, where robust and multiple epitope-specific CD8+ T cell responses are assisted by CD4+ T cells for spontaneous resolution of infection (Shin et al., 2016). This is supported by observations that the depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in chimpanzees delays rapid clearance and recovery from infection by these viruses (Grakoui et al., 2003, Thimme et al., 2003). When HCV and HBV infections become chronically persistent, virus-specific T cells become exhausted and functionally impaired. In acute HCV infection, virus-specific T cells are only detected in the blood and liver after 8 weeks postinfection, and their appearance coincides with large declines of virus titres (Thimme et al., 2002, Shin et al., 2006, Shin et al., 2011). HBV virus\u2013specific T cell responses are also important for spontaneous resolution of HBV infection, where their responses are observed to be vigorous, broad, and polyclonal in patients resolving primary infections and where their absences are associated with prolonged infection and delayed viral clearance (Chisari et al., 2010, Thimme et al., 2003). CD8+ T cells also play important roles in HAV infection, where these have been observed to target multiple epitopes of HAV, despite more recent results suggesting that HAV is controlled by virus-specific CD4+ T cells and not CD8+ T cells (Walker et al., 2015, Shin et al., 2016). Finally, hepatitis virus infection results in liver injury, not directly caused by these viruses but rather by immune-mediated mechanisms (Guidotti and Chisari, 2006). Liver injury biomarkers correlate with acute Hav, Hab, and HAC infection (Guidotti, Chisari, 2006, Park, Rehermann, 2014, Walker et al., 2015) and may result from cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells, believed to induce apoptosis of hepatocytes in close proximity to their targeted cells (Guidotti and Chisari, 2006), by IL-22 producing Th17-differentiated T cells, and by recruitment of nonspecific mononuclear cells by HBV-specific cytokine secreting CD8+ T cells (Iannacone et al., 2007, Shin et al., 2016).",

The host immune response against picornaviruses includes cytokine release, antibody production, and CTL activation, reviewed in Dotzauer and Kraemer (2012).",

PV remains an important cause of neurologic disease as the three live-attenuated vaccine strains are at risk of recombining their genomes to revert to virulent form (Griffin, 2010). PV is endemic in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nigeria, where political reasons, in part, are the most significant modality toward achieving PV eradication via vaccination. PV can usually be cleared by the adaptive immune response. Under conditions of antibody deficiencies in humans, however, continuous fecal shedding of PV contributes to the establishment of persistent infection cycles (Martin, 2006, Nathanson, 2008, Libbey, Fujinami, 2014).",

The induction of PV-specific CD4+ T cells has been suggested to be the result of stimulating by PV-infected DCs and macrophages (Wahid et al., 2005, Dotzauer, Kraemer, 2012), where it has been demonstrated that HLA class II presentation remains intact in infected, antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and that cytolytic CD4+ T cells produce IFN-\u03b3 to lyse PV-infected cells for virus clearance. PV-specific cytotoxic, IFN-\u03b3-secreting cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses induced by infected macrophages have also been documented (Wahid et al., 2005), suggesting that both CD4+ and CD8+ cytolytic T cells partake in the adaptive immune reaction against PV (Dotzauer and Kraemer, 2012).\n",

Flaviviruses are enveloped viruses with single-stranded RNA genomes that are translated in the cytoplasm to generate a single polyprotein that is then cleaved into structural and NS proteins by virus and host proteases. The various encoded viral proteins assemble to generate the capsid, the envelope for receptor binding, membrane fusion and viral assembly, and the transmembrane proteins (prM) that assist in protein folding and function.

IFN-dependent and complement system innate immune responses, along with humoral neutralizing antibodies, protect against virus dissemination and spread, reviewed in Diamond (2003).

T cell responses to JE vaccination have been reported, where for SA14-14-2, T cell responses were detected in the majority following vaccination, and these cross-reacted with other flaviviruses (Turtle et al., 2017). JE-specific T cell responses are observed in PBMCs isolated from JE-infected patients and vaccinated individuals. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells directed against structural viral proteins were identified in vaccinated individuals, in contrast to specific CD4+ and CD8+ responses against NS or C proteins in infected patients (Nathanson and Cole, 1971). These findings indicate that NS proteins, and especially NS3 have important roles in the initiation of T cell responses, as the main target of JE-specific T cell\u2013mediated immune responses. In addition, cytolytic CD4+ T cells clones that cross-reactive with other flaviviruses have been generated from individuals immunized with inactivated JE vaccine (Aihara et al., 1998). Finally, CD4+ and CD8+ and Th1 T cells are believed to be primary determinants of protection from JE infection (Kumar et al., 2004a, Kumar et al., 2004b).",

Alphavirus virions acquire host cell lipid membranes during viral assembly (Fuller, 1987, Acheson, Tamm, 1967, Vogel et al., 1986), with 80 E1 and E2 viral GPs spike protrusions, arranged in an icosahedral pattern embedded within their membranes and interacting with nucleocapsid (Fuller, 1987, Vogel et al., 1986, Owen, Kuhn, 1997). Alphavirus single-stranded, positive-sense, RNA genomes are 12 kb long and consist of two large open reading frames encoding the NS and structural polyproteins that are subsequently cleaved by both viral and host proteases to create four NS proteins (nsP1 to 4) and five structural proteins (C, E3, E2, 6k, E1) (Strauss et al., 1984, Hardy, Strauss, 1989); reviewed in Leung et al.

Development of severe encephalitis is believed to result from neuronal cell death from accelerated viral spread and host neuroinflammatory viral responses (Paessler et al., 2006, Paessler et al., 2007). Antibodies are protective against lethal meningoencephalitis when the virus is transmitted by insects, and virus-specific CD4+ T cells are found to be important for protection from lethal meningoencephalitis from aerosol transmission routes (Paessler et al., 2007, Yun et al., 2009); reviewed in Libbey and Fujinami (2014).",

Past outbreaks have lasted several years and have involved up to 100,000 equine and human cases over large geographical regions, with the largest outbreaks on record were from the 1960s, where central Colombia saw over 200,000 human cases and an estimated 100,000 equine deaths. More recent outbreaks in Mexico and South America are behind the classification of VEEV as a re-emerging disease (Weaver et al., 2004).

Up to 4% of rarer cases of CNS involvement usually follow acute febrile phases, with associated severities of neurological disease ranging from somnolence and mild confusion, to seizures, ataxia, paralysis, and coma, with mortality rates ranging as high as 35% in infected children and 10% in infected adults (Bowen et al., 1976). VEEV has also been reported to cause long-term neurological deficits, abortions, and teratogenic effects (De La Monte et al., 1985, Rivas et al., 1997, Weaver et al., 1996). Like VEEV, though the majority of human infections with EEEV are asymptomatic, CNS involvement results in severe neurological signs, lesions, and sequelae, with an estimated associated human mortality rate of 75%, and with its neurological manifestations including facial edema, paresis, paralysis, respiratory impairment, altered mental state, and seizures in children, many of these symptoms persisting long-term in surviving patients. In fatal cases of EEEV, gross lesions in the brain include edema, meningeal congestion, hemorrhage, and malacia (Deresiewicz et al., 1997). As with VEEV and EEEV, natural human cases of WEEV typically show an early, flu-like illness with associated fever, malaise, and headache. Similar to EEEV, WEEV results in CNS involvement in a significant proportion of cases, including symptoms of somnolence, seizures, coma, and motor neuron dysfunction. Ninety percent of infants infected with WEEV have severe CNS symptoms (Calisher, 1994). Human mortality rates from WEEV infection range from 3% to 15%, and neurological sequelae may become permanent features in survivors (Steele and Twenhafel, 2010).",

Both innate and adaptive immune responses can control viruses targeting CNS neurons (Griffin, 2003). Viral disruption of the type I IFN signaling pathways interferes with survival from VEEV, as well as of those infected with Sindbis and West Nile viruses (Ryman et al., 2000, Samuel, Diamond, 2005, White et al., 2001). Virus-specific antibody responses are critical in limiting viral spread and facilitating clearance of infectious virus from neurons within the brain (Diamond et al., 2003, Levine et al., 1991). Both alpha beta (\u03b1\u03b2) and gamma delta (\u03b3\u03b4) T cell responses have been demonstrated as being important for the control of VEEV (Paessler et al., 2006). T cell responses reduce mortality rates by direct killing of infected cells, producing antiviral cytokines and increasing production of virus-specific antibodies (Bilzer, Stitz, 1994, Patterson et al., 2002, Shrestha et al., 2006, Sitati, Diamond, 2006). VEEV replicon particles delivered as an adjuvant have been demonstrated to induce activation of CD8+ T cell responses (Thompson et al., 2008). More recently, T cells have been demonstrated to facilitate recovery from VEEV-induced encephalomyelitis in absence of antibodies, responsible for dramatic reduction in viral titres in CNS, where CD4+ T cells were the best T cell producers of IFN-\u03b3 response and were more efficient at controlling VEEV in CNS lesions than CD8+ T cells, facilitating recovery from severe viral encephalomyelitis (Brooke et al., 2010).",

A more stably attenuated VEEV vaccine candidate called V3526 has been produced, where preclinical testing has demonstrated it to be safe and immunogenic and possibly superior to TC-83 (Pratt et al., 2003, Hart et al., 2000, Ludwig et al., 2001).

            "text": "RABV is the type species of the genus Lyssavirus, within the Rhabdoviridae family. Rhabdoviruses are negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses having a distinctive bullet-shaped structure. Up to 10 viruses of Lyssaviruses have the potential to cause rabies in humans. These have a 12,000 nucleotide genome encoding five proteins: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), glycoprotein (G), and RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (L) (Marston et al., 2007). RABV causes acute encephalitis in mammals, causing fatality rates of almost 100%. RABV commonly infects many animals, including bats, skunks, foxes, and dogs and can also infect insects and plants. RABV in animal saliva spreads between hosts via bites or scratches. Infected animals can survive for years, secreting infectious particles in their saliva, but untreated infection in humans generally results in rapidly fatal acute myeloencephalitis (Koyuncu et al., 2013). Rabid dogs are the most important reservoirs for RABV, where dog bites account for more than 99% of human infections. RABV, like all members of Lyssaviruses, is neurotropic and infects peripheral nerves close to the primary site of the bite. RABV then rapidly moves by retrograde axonal transport to the dorsal root ganglia where virus replication begins (Johnson et al., 2010). RABV particles enter axons of motor neurons at the NMJ via their binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (e.g., nAchR) and neural cell adhesion molecules (Ugolini, 2011). Transneuronal RABV spread occurs between synaptically connected neurons, whereby viruses move from postsynaptic to presynaptic neurons. In humans, a relatively long asymptomatic incubation period after initial RABV infection can occur, sometimes lasting up to 1 year, and providing some time for CNS infection intervention. However, death almost always ensues after RABV infection reaches the CNS, with marked behavioral and neurological symptoms (Koyuncu et al., 2013). Once RABV has entered the CNS, it rapidly moves to the brain and is associated with an explosive increase in virus replication. Initial symptoms include pain or paraesthesia close to the bite site and are often associated with fever, fatigue, and weakness in associated limbs. Nonspecific neurological symptoms including headache and anxiety occur days prior to acute encephalitis (Morrison and Wenzel, 1985). Currently, there are no available therapies against disease symptoms once they develop, and death ensues within a number of days following CNS-associated symptoms (Jackson et al., 2003) and reviewed in Johnson et al. (2010).",

            "text": "RABV replication begins following CNS penetration, thereby limiting earlier possible detection of low-level primary antigens in the peripheral circulation. This delays antigen presentation, where antigens later but rapidly drain from the CNS to local lymphoid tissues (Knopf et al., 1998). Once B cells are stimulated, the next delaying obstacle is re-entry into the CNS, but experimental models have demonstrated T and B cell infiltration of dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, and brain (Johnson et al., 2008), with T cells as the major immune subsets, but where most of these CNS-infiltrated T cells have Fas-mediated apoptotic phenotypes (Baloul and Lafon, 2003). Further intrinsic complexities in immune responses are present in the CNS, including tight MHC expression regulation (Irwin et al., 1999), and the expression of immunosuppressive factors by neuronal cells. Additionally, the BBB remains intact during RABV infection (Roy et al., 2007). Numerous studies have suggested that the virus suppresses the adaptive immune response, believed to be in part due to a deficit of adaptive immune effector cell accumulation within the CNS due to a virally induced reduction in BBB permeability (Libbey, Fujinami, 2014, Roy et al., 2007).",

YFV virions are icosahedral and are composed of nucleocapsid, composed of capsid (C) protein subunits and a surrounding lipid bilayer derived from host membranes. The viral envelope is studded with dimers of envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins, for a total diameter of approximately 45 nm. As the major component of the virion surface, the E protein is responsible for cell-surface receptor binding, virion assembly, fusion, and immunogenicity. Viral proteins are encoded in a single open reading frame and produced as a polyprotein later processed by proteolytic cleavage into structural (C, M, and E) and NS proteins (NS1, NS2a, Ns2b, Ns3, NS4a, Ns4B, and NS5), reviewed in Gardner and Ryman (2010).",

YF is the prototypical VHF, sharing many pathophysiological features with other viral disorders only associated via similarities in syndromes, but with the exception that YF causes the most severe symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (Monath and Vasconcelos, 2015). YFV remains endemic in South American and African countries, with monkeys as its reservoir, causing regular outbreaks of jungle YF, and resulting in as many as 200,000 infections per year causing 30,000 deaths. Millions are at risk for infection in Africa, where vaccination prevalence is low. The 2016 outbreak in Angola serves as an example of YFV traveler-associated spreading to neighboring countries, where it reached as far as China, then na\u00efve for virus (Watson and Klimstra, 2017), and representing a prime population for a major outbreak of epic proportions (Wasserman et al., 2016). Geographical shifting of mosquito populations to North America is also creating new risk for YFV, dengue, and Zika infection of na\u00efve populations (Monaghan et al., 2016). Despite the availability of vaccination against YFV since the 1940s, large epidemics have still arisen, with dramatic surges of YFV in Africa in the 1960s and the late 1980s, with each reporting over 100,000 cases. Recent outbreaks have also affected Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina, Uganda, and Sudan and Ethiopia. Immunity is the critical for reducing and eliminating viral infections, but other contributing factors to virus amplification are multifactorial and elusive, including the emergence of new viral strains and prolonged periods of hot and humid weather promoting insect propagation, reviewed in Monath and Vasconcelos (2015).",

Neutralizing antibodies remain the accepted correlate of protection against YFV, with 90% or greater of 17D immunized individuals developing neutralizing antibodies (Gotuzzo et al., 2013). 17D also elicits a complex modulation of innate immune cytokines, with elevated levels of plasma IFN-\u03b3 15 days postvaccination (Neves et al., 2009). Restimulation of innate immune cell cultures of NK cells, neutrophils, and monocytes from 17D vaccinated humans with YF antigen results in the increased production of IFN-\u03b3, IL-1beta, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-10 (Neves et al., 2009, Gardner, Ryman, 2010, Luiza-Silva et al., 2011, Silva et al., 2011). Since its development, humoral immunity, as a gold standard of general vaccine development, was the most studied aspect of human immunity to 17D. However, recent studies of adaptive T cell\u2013mediated immunity to 17D have demonstrated that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells strongly respond to 17D, with activated CD8+ T cells detected as 3 days after vaccination (Akondy et al., 2015), and CD4+ T cells detected several days later (Akondy et al., 2015, Kohler et al., 2012, Blom et al., 2013). Increased CD8+ T cell proliferation correlates directly with the levels of virus genomes in plasma, which peaks once virus is eliminated (Akondy et al., 2015). CD8+ T cell clones responding to 17D differentiate into central memory and effector memory subpopulations (Dewitt et al., 2015) and are still detectable 25 years following vaccination (Wieten et al., 2016). 17D-specific CD8+ T cells respond to epitopes contained from every protein product generated by the 17D polyprotein, and upon peptide restimulation, these 17D-specific CD8+ T cells have activated cytotoxic profiles including increased expression of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and MIP1-\u03b2 and IL-2 granzyme B and CD107a (Blom et al., 2013, Akondy et al., 2009) but are not exhausted and retain long-lived memory and polyfunctional phenotypes for at least 2 years following 17D rechallenge (Akondy et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV), also a member of the single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses from the Flaviviridae family, causes visceral and CNS disease in humans and is closely related to YFV, where DENV fever has often been mistaken for YFV infection. Far more serious is DHF, where additional symptoms develop, including hemorrhage and shock, and have mortality rates exceeding 30% if left untreated (Rogers et al., 2006). DENV is a spherical, 50-nm virion, comprising of three structural proteins: capsid (C), premembrane and membrane (prM and M), and envelope (E). The E protein directs several critical steps of the viral replication cycle, including engagement with cellular attachment and entry factors, membrane fusion, and virion assembly. DENV binds to target cells via glycosaminoglycans, C-type lectins such as DC-SIGN, the mannose receptor CD206, and immunomodulatory proteins (TIM and TAM receptors; Diamond and Pierson, 2015). Thus targets for DENV infection include monocytes, macrophages, DCs, mast cells, and possibly hepatocytes and endothelial cells. Following its entry into the cellular cytoplasm, the viral genomic 10.7 kb RNA is translated into a single polyprotein, later cleaved into three structural and seven NS proteins (NS1, NS2a, Ns2b, Ns3, NS4a, Ns4B, and NS5) by viral NS3 and host cell proteases. Twenty-five percent of DENV infections cause both mild symptoms including dengue fever (DF) to more severe and lethal DHF, causing shock via hemorrhagic and capillary leak syndrome. DF can be characterized by abrupt onset febrile illness causing headache, severe muscle and joint pain, and rash, whereas DHF is characterized by rapid onset capillary leakage accompanied by significant thrombocytopenia and liver injury (Halstead, 2007).",

DENV adaptation to human demography is via mosquito vector Aedes aegypti, breeding in urban areas (Trpis and Hausermann, 1986). Cases of DENV infection have increased since the 1960s, with an estimated 50 million cases of DF, and 500,000 cases of DHF occurring globally every year. There are no cures for DENV-associated disorders, and vaccine development has been complicated by antibody-dependent enhancement of future heterotypic infection induced by vaccination (Vaughn, 2000, Halstead, Deen, 2002). Thus avoidance and control of Aedes aegypti is the best approach for limiting DENV infection (Rogers et al., 2006).",

LASV is predicted to be responsible for approximately 300,000 infections and up to 6000 resultant deaths each year (Ogbu et al., 2007, Mccormick et al., 1987). Transmission to humans is via the rodent host Mastomys natalensis (Mccormick et al., 1987). APCs, DCs, and macrophages are believed to be the first cells targeted by LASV infection (Baize et al., 2004, Mahanty et al., 2003), which can rapidly speed up dissemination of LASV to multisystem organs due to their widespread physiological distributions in mucosal tissues and skin. Due to their ease in motility across various organs and tissues, APCs are believed to the responsible for the spread of LASV for the establishment of systemic infection (Hensley et al., 2011). APC infection results in substantial virus release in the secondary lymphoid organs, the liver, hepatocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells that are subsequently infected. Lymphopenia of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and B cells is observed early during disease onset, reviewed in Russier et al. (2012).\n",

These early symptoms are typically followed by more severe symptoms of pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. In severely affected patients, cervical and facial edema, hemorrhages, renal and liver failures, and encephalopathy occur, and death follows systemic shock (Edington and White, 1972). Survivors of LASV-related disorders have persisting lifelong morbidities and disabling conditions including deafness (Cummins et al., 1990). No vaccine has been licensed against LASV, and ribavirin is the only existing treatment, but is only effective if administered very early after infection and is not available for broad distribution in countries where LASV is endemic (Mccormick et al., 1986).",

            "text": "T cells play a crucial role in the outcome of severe LASV infection, which has been associated with defective T cell responses since the very cells responsible for stimulating T cell antigen responses are those infected by the virus. However, T cell responses have been demonstrated to play critical roles in the control of LASV, where strong memory CD4+ T cell responses directed against LASV NP and GP proteins are observed in LASV-seropositive healthy individuals from endemic regions (Ter Meulen et al., 2000, Meulen et al., 2004). High serum concentrations of IL-8 and CXCL10 chemokines that attract and activate T cells are associated with nonfatal LASV infections (Christensen et al., 2006, Dufour et al., 2002) and vice versa in fatality cases (Mahanty et al., 2001). The control of acute LF has been correlated with increases in circulating activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in response to LASV infection or antigen (Baize et al., 2009). In vaccine studies, protection against a lethal LASV rechallenge is associated with the induction of T cell immunity (Fisher-Hoch et al., 2000, Geisbert et al., 2005). However, in comparison to other viruses, LASV-infected DCs are unable to mount effector T cell responses (Pannetier et al., 2011). Human and nonhuman primate studies have demonstrated that LASV NP and GP proteins are the main viral antigens recognized by activated T cells (Meulen et al., 2004, Ter Meulen et al., 2000, Fisher-Hoch et al., 2000, Fisher-Hoch, Mccormick, 2001, Fisher-Hoch, Mccormick, 2004, Geisbert et al., 2005), suggesting that vaccines using these proteins to induce long-term memory T cell expansion will best control the spread of LF.\n",

EBOV is a member of the Filoviridae family, which are filamentous, negative-stranded RNA viruses that cause severe human disease. Filoviruses viruses are variable, with long filaments measuring 80 nm in diameter and which can reach lengths of up to 1000 nm, with many turns and branches and which have tendency to curve to resemble the number 6. Viruses are composed of nucleocapsid, matrix, and envelope proteins, whereby seven genes encode NP, the viral proteins VP24-VP30-VP35-VP40, L (polymerase), and the GP (Hoenen et al., 2006), expressed as GP1 and GP2, and regulating virus production and release (Mohan et al., 2015). NPs embed the genome in complex with VP30 and VP35 for RNA synthesis. VP40 and VP24 proteins are localized in virus matrix space (Watanabe et al., 2007, Hoenen et al., 2010). EBOV is transmitted to humans via mucosal surfaces, skin injury, and vertical transmission (Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011), and with the exception of T cells, can infect almost all human cells using various different attachment mechanisms, reviewed in Falasca et al. (2015). Both innate and adaptive immune responses are involved in EBOV pathogenesis, where innate immune deregulation involves inhibition of type-I IFN response and perturbation of cytokine signaling, along with impairment of DC and NK cells, and adaptive immune deregulation involves both humoral and cell-mediated immunity (Falasca et al., 2015).",

For 50 years, EBOV and related filoviruses have been repeatedly re-emerging to cause large epidemics of highly fatal HF.

EBOV-infected DCs are impaired in cytokine production required for T cell activation (Mahanty et al., 2003), whereas infected macrophages are unable to mature (Bosio et al., 2003). EBOV is classified as an immunosuppressive virus since numerous of its proteins interfere with immune responses by inducing T cell apoptosis, lymphopenia, and absence of antibody responses in fatal cases (Basler and Amarasinghe, 2009). Classification of EBOV-targeting mechanisms has been compromised by lack of infrastructure for adequate biosafety containment level facilities required to analyze this deadly virus. However, observations of the adaptive T cell immune response have shown that EBOV correlates with fatal outcomes by causing aberrant cytokine responses (Baize et al., 1999, Baize et al., 2002, Wauquier et al., 2010, Villinger et al., 1999, Ansari, 2014), decreased CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and increased apoptotic T cell phenotypes (Baize et al., 1999, Wauquier et al., 2010, Geisbert et al., 2000, Bradfute et al., 2010, Gupta et al., 2007). In recent work, EBOV induced increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation against the viral NP, with CD8+ T cells demonstrating the largest increases in expression of activation and proliferation biomarkers, with sustained activation following EBOV clearance and following patient discharge, suggesting continued antigen stimulation after resolution of the disease (Mcelroy et al., 2015). Recently, an rVSV-ZEBOV recombinant, replication\u2013competent vesicular stomatitis virus\u2013based vaccine expressing a surface GP of Zaire ebolavirus, demonstrate a 100% efficacy in preventing EBOV disease in contacts and contacts of contacts of recently confirmed cases in Guinea, West Africa (Henao-Restrepo, 2017 #550). This vaccine produced rapid innate immune responses after a single dose, suggested to lead to longer-term full protection by providing an essential period of restricted virus replication during the development of specific adaptive responses (Marzi, 2015 #551).",

Transmission of CCHFV to humans occurs through contact with infected animal blood, or ticks, belonging to the genus Hyalomma, as its primary vectors and providing transit from one infected human to another (Mousavi-Jazi et al., 2012). CCHFV human infection involves sudden onset of acute symptoms, including high fever, headache, myalgia, and petechial rash, followed by hemorrhage progressing to multiorgan failure, with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes as hallmarks of the overall disorder (Begum et al., 1970, Sanchez et al., 2006). Outbreak-associated fatality rates are varied but can reach 70% (Mousavi-Jazi et al., 2012). There is currently no licensed vaccine, and use of Ribavirin as treatment has been investigated but remains controversial (Begum et al., 1970, Bente et al., 2010). Distribution of CCHFV infection and associated disease follows geographical spread of the principal vectors (Bente et al., 2013, Whitehouse, 2004). Clinical CCHFV disorders are described in Africa, Asia, the Middle and East Eastern Europe, and have recently emerged in other countries including Turkey, India, Spain, and Greece, and with almost 10,000 cases reported in Turkey between 2002 and 2015 (Maltezou et al., 2010, Papa et al., 2008, Leblebicioglu et al., 2016).",

IgM and IgG antibodies have however not been correlated with clearance, viral load, or outcomes (Duh et al., 2007), implying that innate and T cell immunity must be critical for viral clearance. Neutralizing antibodies also do not cause protection, and non-neutralizing antibodies may assist in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al., 2005). Thus, as immune correlates of protection for CCHFV are not well documented, vaccine design has aimed at targeting the CCHFV NP or GPs. Only an inactivated vaccine is available, and even though the attaining of immunogenicity has required its administration in multiple doses, it was demonstrated to reduce infections and induce both neutralizing antibody responses and T cell responses to NP peptides (Mousavi-Jazi et al., 2012). Another promising approach is the use of modified VACV Ankara recombinant vaccine expressing the viral GPs, which induce cellular and humoral responses and which are observed to provide protection from lethal disease in mice (Buttigieg et al., 2014, Dowall et al., 2016). Although T cell responses are known to play a role in protection from and clearance of viral infections, it was only recently that specific CD8+ T cell epitopes against GN and GC were shown to stimulate IFN-\u03b3 production, whereby responses were detectable several years after the acute CCHFV infection, even in the absence of continued antigenic stimulation, and where IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells were confirmed as responsible for providing long-term protection (Goedhals et al., 2017).",

YFV is transmitted by mosquitos in urban areas, causing as many as 200,000 infections and 30,000 deaths annually. Like other mosquito vector viruses, YFV is an existing and re-emerging threat due to increased geological spread by both world travelers and shifting mosquito breeding geographies. Flaviviruses evade immunity to enter the brain and spinal cord via circulating blood, crossing the BBB via \u201cTrojan horse\u201d mechanism. Dissemination of infection and protection against YFV is elicited by IFN-signaling, complement system, and other innate, humoral, and adaptive immune responses. Neutralizing antibodies are still the gold standard correlates of protection, but evidence that a robust, long-lived, and polyfunctional adaptive CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immune response is what is provided, early after vaccination by the 500 million doses of effective YF 17D vaccine distributed globally. Importantly, these are nonexhausted, polyfunctional central memory and effector memory T cell subsets that are detected for over 25 years following vaccination.",

            "text": "Despite many documented instances of virus eradication from populations by earlier vaccination strategies, there is a continuous imminent risk of outbreaks of pandemic proportions by existing and emerging viruses, as a result of anti-vaccination campaigns, unforeseen viral strain recombination, exposure of na\u00efve populations to viruses by infected world travellers, a rapidly growing and aging and immunocompromised world population, acts of bioterrorism, and use of viruses as biological weapons in war. Past strategies in the development of certain vaccines have often been lucky in their efficacies due to their eliciting both humoral and long-lasting adaptive T cell immunity, whereas others have failed and have only induced shorter lived humoral responses that do not always confer long-lasting protection. The precise and likely overlapping mechanisms dictating lifelong immunity conferred by successful vaccines against smallpox, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, and YF are not completely understood. What has become clear however is that innate immunity usually primes adaptive immunity to confer this long-term protection. It is not a lack of existing immune-monitoring methodologies but rather perhaps a lack of their correct implementation in the continued analysis of vaccinated individuals that are hampering the gaining of this important knowledge. Therefore it seems there is an urgent need for the standardization of vaccine methodologies adequately measuring effector memory T cell responses and host-immune evasion mechanisms in appropriate animal models and humans and through the use of multiparametric immune-monitoring platforms able to simultaneously document numerous immune cell phenotypes across time postexposure, vaccination, or rechallenge. The importance of global development of standardized procedures of biospecimen banking from vaccinated individuals cannot be understated and will provide unprecedented statistical power in the analysis of the balance between the innate and adaptive immune arms conferring lifelong resistance to infection. The standardization of these methodologies should better assist future rational design of vaccines and boost confidence toward the mass production and stockpiling of these critical prophylactic measures against otherwise crippling and lethal viral disorders.\n",
