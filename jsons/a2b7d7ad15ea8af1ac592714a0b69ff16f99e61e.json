Through regular meetings and brainstorming sessions, both sectors have developed joint operational plans, a long-term risk reduction plan 2011-2015, initiated a prioritization exercise and risk assessment for 29 zoonotic diseases, and reviewed and revised standards, procedures, and communication strategies. In 2011, a list of experts on major zoonoses were identified from different sectors and formed into a taskforce to identify the focal points for rabies, brucellosis, and vector-borne diseases. As a result, disease control strategies are now linked to scientific research and epidemiological expertise. ",

As a result, the prevalence of animal brucellosis has decreased from 10 to 0.5 %. However, in the 1990s human brucellosis re-emerged following transition to free market economy, collapse of systems that were responsible to public health issues and lack of resources to continue surveillance accordingly. In 2000, a new vaccination strategy was introduced with the aim of eradicating the disease by 2010, but attempts to control the disease have been unsuccessful because of inconsistent strategies with respect to vaccination of livestock and the detection and elimination of infected animals from the herd. The seroprevalence of brucellosis in humans, livestock, and dogs was investigated as a pilot project in Sukhbaatar and Zavkhan province with support from Swiss Development Agency. The results of the study by veterinary and medical epidemiologists served as a baseline for assessing and monitoring the effectiveness of a conjunctival vaccination campaign in 2010. In addition, the conjunctival vaccine campaign has assisted the development of new strategy for national brucellosis control and for livestock export.",

Over 200,000 serum samples from five major species of animals and 2,333 serum samples from human were collected and laboratory investigation were carried out, following OIE recommendations.

In addition, the atlas includes population density, livestock density, antibiotic use, immunization coverage, and other relevant factors and will be regularly updated. It will be made available online by 2012. The use of GIS tools and geo-referenced, subnational level epidemiological data allowed the production of maps that improve spatial quality of previous maps. It was shown that diseases such as brucellosis, glanders, and bovine leucosis in animals have been introduced into previously unaffected areas by cattle movement. The atlas will lay the basis for novel, evidence-based methodologies to estimate the population at risk and burden of disease, ultimately leading to more targeted interventions.

Endemic zoonoses such as plague, anthrax, and vector-borne diseases occur regularly due to a lack of public awareness, and there is a high infectivity rate of brucellosis among herdsmen and veterinarians. Unsafe cultural traditions are widespread among the general population, such as consumption of raw milk, undercooked sheep liver, and sour cream made from raw milk. Public health education programs need to be aimed at specific community groups, school children, and occupational groups, taking into account culture, beliefs, traditions, educational level, social status, occupation, and age. An involvement of community and local government in health education through health education in schools and in the workplace has proved to be effective. Health messages on how to prevent infection with tick-borne diseases and the production of leaflets and posters were distributed before the tick season.

During the first 5 years of the Strategy, the two regions experienced a number of infectious disease threats including the establishment of HPAI as an endemic disease, the rapid global spread of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, and a large number of other acute events with significant public health impact.
