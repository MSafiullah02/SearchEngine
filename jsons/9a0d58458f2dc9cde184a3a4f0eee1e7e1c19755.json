Two of the main responses are the production of T helper 1 (Th1) cytokines during viral and bacterial infections and Th2 cytokine production upon parasite infection (1) (2) (3) . Particularly in the Western world, there has been an increase in the number of subjects who respond to common allergens such as grass pollen and house dust mite, a response which is characterized by Th2 cytokine production (4) . A change in exposure to pathogens may underlie this increased prevalence of allergic disease. The infant immune system differs from that of adults as it is skewed towards a Th2 response after birth, developing into a normal adult Th1 cytokine profile in subsequent years (5) . As postulated in the hygiene hypothesis (6) , frequent infections during childhood may affect this maturation process. Th1 cytokine production during infection may skew the infant immune response from Th2 to Th1. As a consequence, infants suffering from many infections may have a diminished risk of developing Th2-mediated allergic disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 243, "end": 246, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 247, "end": 250, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 251, "end": 254, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 480, "end": 483, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 757, "end": 760, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 803, "end": 806, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Several types of infection may account for the reduced risk of allergic disease. Lactobacilli Respiratory infections in infancy may protect against developing Th2mediated allergic disease (hygiene hypothesis). To estimate the relative contribution of particular viruses to the development of the immune system and allergic disease, we investigated longitudinally the prevalence of respiratory viral infections in infants. One hundred and twentysix healthy infants were included in this prospective birth cohort study in their first year of life. Physical examination was performed and nasal brush samples were taken during routine visits every 6 months and during an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (sick visits). The prevalence of respiratory viral infections in infants with URTI, infants with rhinitis without general malaise and infants without nasal symptoms was studied. Rhinovirus was the most prevalent pathogen during URTI and rhinitis in 0-to 2-year-old infants (40%). During URTI, also respiratory syncytial virus (20%) and coronavirus (10%) infections were found, which were rarely detected in infants with rhinitis. Surprisingly, in 20% of infants who did not present with nasal symptoms, rhinovirus infections were also detected. During routine visits at 12 months, a higher prevalence of rhinovirus infections was found in infants who attended day-care compared with those who did not. We did not observe a relation between breast-feeding or smoking by one or both parents and the prevalence of rhinovirus infections. The parental history of atopy was not related to the prevalence of rhinovirus infection, indicating that the genetic risk of allergic disease does not seem to increase the chance of rhinovirus infections. In conclusion, rhinovirus infection is the most prevalent respiratory viral infection in infants. It may therefore affect the maturation of the immune system and the development of allergic disease considerably. colonizing the gut immediately after birth and bacterial infection or exposure to bacterial products during childhood may reduce the risk of allergic disease (7, 8) . Because viruses induce the majority of respiratory tract infections, these pathogens have been most extensively studied in relation to allergic disease (9) . Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a reduced risk of allergic disease in children with older siblings and children attending day-care, who are known to be all heavily exposed to viral infections (10, 11) .

Only a few coronavirus infections were detected in children of 12 months and older. Below the age of 24 months, the prevalence of RSV remained 20%. This is likely to decrease during later childhood because prevalences up to 13% have been reported in adults (30) . At the age of 18 months, most children (75%) will have been infected with RSV at least once (31) . The prevalence of rhinovirus increases slowly to more than 50%. In adults, a prevalence of 80% has been reported for rhinovirus during the common cold (16) . This indicates that rhinovirus prevalence found in infants in the present study may increase further. Why does the prevalence of rhinovirus remain unaltered or even increase gradually, whereas the prevalence of RSV decreases with age? For RSV, which has few different serotypes, humoral and cellular responses may possibly protect the child from frequent re-infections. By contrast, over 100 different serotypes of rhinovirus are present (32) . Re-infection with rhinovirus is therefore likely to occur with a new serotype for which the child does not yet have induced humoral and cellular responses. Frequent viral infections are believed to be important modulators of the natural maturation of the infant immune system from Th2-to Th1-skewed and may affect the development of allergic disease (5, 12) . This maturation is likely to result from repeated stimulation by pathogens, rather than from a single viral infection. The general effect of a particular virus is dependent on both the prevalence of the virus and on the type of host immune response upon infection. RSV is capable of inducing a general inflammatory response in infants which largely induces an immune response towards Th1 (33) . Since now rhinovirus has been found to be more prevalent than RSV in infants, the question arises to what extend rhinovirus infections are able to influence the infant immune maturation and modulation. We are currently investigating what type of immune response a rhinovirus infection can induce in infants and whether this type of immune response differs between infants with URTI and rhinitis (van Benten et al., unpublished data).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 367, "end": 371, "text": "(30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 466, "end": 470, "text": "(31)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 624, "end": 628, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1069, "end": 1073, "text": "(32)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1426, "end": 1429, "text": "(5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1430, "end": 1433, "text": "12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1824, "end": 1828, "text": "(33)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Interestingly, rhinovirus was also detected in infants without nasal symptoms (20%).
