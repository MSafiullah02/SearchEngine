In such networks, entities may share common or similar attributes and may be connected by paths through multiple attribute modalities. In this work, we present an approach that uses semantically meaningful, bimodal random walks on real-world heterogeneous networks to extract correlations between nodes and bring together nodes with shared or similar attributes. An attention-based mechanism is used to combine multiple attribute-specific representations in a late fusion setup. We focus on a real-world network formed by restaurants and their shared attributes and evaluate performance on predicting the number of reviews a restaurant receives, a strong proxy for popularity. Our results demonstrate the rich expressiveness of such representations in predicting review volume and the ability of an attention-based model to selectively combine individual representations for maximum predictive power on the chosen downstream task.",

For example, they may share the same neighborhood, the same operating hours, similar kind of cuisine, or the same 'look and feel'. Furthermore, each of these attributes only uncovers a specific type of relation. For example, a view that only uses the location-modality will contain venues only connected by their colocation in a common geographical unit and will prioritize physical proximity over any other attribute. Broadly, each of these views is characterized by a semantic context and encodes modality-specific relations between restaurants. These views, although informative, are complementary and only record associations within the same modality. While each of these views encodes a part of the interactions within the network, performance on a downstream task relies on a suitable combination of views pertinent to the task [5] .",

As such, they have been used for inference in large multimodal collections where a single modality may not carry sufficient information [2] . Initial work in this domain was structured around the task of captioning unseen images using correlations learned over multiple modalities (tag-propagation or auto-tagging). Pan et al. use a graph-based model to discover correlations between image features and text for automatic image-captioning [21] . Urban et al. use an Image-Context Graph consisting of captions, image features and images to retrieve relevant images for a textual query [32] . Stathopoulos et al. [28] build upon [32] to learn a similarity measure over words based on their co-occurrence on the web and use these similarities to introduce links between similar caption words. Rudinac et al. augment the Image-Context Graph with users as an additional modality and deploy it for generating visual-summaries of geographical regions [25] . Since we are interested in discovering multimodal similarities between restaurants, we use a graph layout similar to the one proposed by Pan et al. [21] for the image auto-captioning task but replace images with restaurants as central nodes. Other nodes containing textual features, visual features and users are retained. We also add categorical information like cuisines as a separate modality, allowing them to serve as semantic anchors within the representation.",

            "text": "Graph representation learning aims to learn mappings that embed graph nodes in a low-dimensional compressed representation. The objective is to learn embeddings where geometric relationships in the compressed embedding space reflect structural relationships in the graph. Traditional approaches generate these embeddings by finding the leading eigenvectors from the affinity matrix for representing nodes [16, 24] . With the advent of deep learning, neural networks have become increasingly popular for learning such representations, jointly, from multiple modalities in an end-to-end pipeline [4, 11, 14, 30, 34] . Existing random walk-based embedding methods are extensions of the Random Walks with Restarts (RWR) paradigm. Traditional RWR-based techniques compute an affinity between two nodes in a graph by ascertaining the steadystate transition probability between them. They have been extensively used for the aforementioned auto-captioning tasks [21, 25, 28, 32] , tourism recommendation [15] and web search as an integral part of the PageRank algorithm [20] . Deep Learning-based approaches build upon the traditional paradigm by optimizing the co-occurrence statistics of nodes sampled from these walks. DeepWalk [22] uses nodes sampled from short truncated random walks as phrases to optimize a skip-gram objective similar to word2vec [17] . Similarly, node2vec augments this learning paradigm with second-order random walks parameterized by exploration parameters p and q which control between the importance of homophily and structural equivalence in the learnt representations [8] . For a homogeneous network, random walk based methods like DeepWalk and node2vec assume that while the probabilities of transitioning from one node to another can be different, every transition still occurs between nodes of the same type. For heterogeneous graphs, this assumption may be fallacious as all transitions do not occur between nodes of the same type and consequently, do not carry the same semantic context. Indeed, our initial experiments with node2vec model suggest that it is not designed to handle highly multimodal graphs. Clements et al. [5] demonstrated that in the context of content recommendation, the importance of modalities is strongly task-dependent and treating all edges in heterogeneous graphs as equivalent can discard this information. Metapath2Vec [6] remedies this by introducing unbiased walks over the network schema specified by a metapath [29] , allowing the network to learn the semantics specified by the metapath rather than those imposed purely by the topology of the graph. Metapath-based approaches have been extended to a variety of other problems. Hu et al. use an exhaustive list of semantically-meaningful metapaths for extracting Top-N recommendations with a neural co-attention network [10] . Shi et al. use metapath-specific representations in a traditional matrix factorization-based collaborative filtering mechanism [27] . In this work, we perform random walks on sub-networks of a restaurant-attribute network containing restaurants and attribute modalities. These attribute modalities may contain images, text or categorical features. For each of these sub-networks, we perform random walks and use a variant of the heterogeneous skip-gram objective introduced in [6] to generate low-dimensional bimodal embeddings. Bimodal embeddings have several interesting properties. Training relations between two modalities provide us with a degree of modularity where modalities can be included or held-out from the prediction model without affecting others. It also makes training inexpensive as the number of nodes when only considering two modalities is far lower than in the entire graph.",

We then use a distributed bag-ofwords model from [13] to generate low-dimensional representations of these documents for each restaurant. Since the reviews of a restaurant can widely vary based on its popularity, we only consider the 10 most recent reviews for each restaurant to prevent biases from document length getting into the model. 6.

We observe that metapaths with nodes containing categorical attributes perform significantly better than vector-based features. In particular, categorical attributes like Cuisines, Facilities, and Price have a significantly higher coefficient of determination (R 2 ) as compared to visual feature nodes. It is interesting to observe here that nodes like locations, images, and textual reviews are far more numerous than categorical nodes and part of their decreased performance may be explained by the fact that our method of short walks may not be sufficiently expressive when the number of feature nodes is large. In addition, as mentioned in related work, we performed these experiments with the node2vec model, but since it is not designed for heterogeneous multimodal graphs, it yielded performance scores far below the weakest single modality. A review of the fusion models indicates that taking all the metapaths together can improve performance significantly. The baseline simple concatenation fusion model, commonly used in literature, is considerably better than the best-performing metapath (Venues -Facilities -Venues). The attention basedmodel builds significantly over the baseline performance and while it employs a similar concatenation scheme as the baseline concatenation model, the introduction of the attention module allows it to handle noisy and unreliable modalities. The significant increase in the predictive ability of the attention-based model can be attributed to the fact that while all modalities encode information, some of them may be less informative or reliable than others, and therefore contribute less to the performance of the model. Our proposed fusion approach is, therefore, capable of handling weak or noisy modalities appropriately.",

Our attention-based model combines separately learned bimodal embeddings using a late-fusion setup for predicting the review volume of the restaurants. While each of the modalities can predict the volume of reviews to a certain extent, a more comprehensive picture is only built by combining complementary information from multiple modalities. We demonstrate the benefits of our fusion approach on the review volume prediction task and demonstrate that a fusion of complementary views provides the best way to learn from such networks. In future work, we will investigate how the technique generalises to other tasks and domains.",

Location: We split the region under consideration into rectangular geographical cells and bin restaurant locations into these cells. We add a node for every geographical cell that contains at least one restaurant within it. 4. Image Features: Images of a restaurant reflect its visual look-and-feel.Fig. 2. Pipeline for embedding modality-specific sub-networks: In this illustrative example, we use a graph with 2 modalities. {R1, . . . , R3} are restaurant nodes, {A1, . . . , A3} are nodes from a modality with categorical information and {B1, . . . , B3}are nodes from a modality with similarity linkages. Random walks are performed over modality-specific sub-networks for each metapath and each model is trained separately to create metapath-specific embeddings.",
