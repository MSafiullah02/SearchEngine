Additionally, 14 mobile cabin-based hospitals, able to handle 13 thousand moderately ill, confirmed COVID-19 patients are operational [5]. Importantly, substantial social isolation restrictions have been implemented in an attempt to control the outbreak of COVID19 throughout China, including mandatory wearing of facemasks, and extremely strict limitations on outdoor and group activities, particularly mandating almost no public and/or private social gatherings [6]. In addition, there has been an extension of school holidays and the introduction of the use of internet classes only. At April 3, 2020, the total number of COVID-19 patients in Gansu Province has been 92, with two deaths and 90 recoveries. Consequently, the rate of newly identified COVID-19 cases has been reduced substantially in China, probably due to the active approaches outlined above, combined with substantial limitations to interstate/international travel.",

Gansu Province is a long, handle-shaped province, with a total land area of 454,000 km2 and a population of 26,257,100 in 2019. It is a relatively remote region of north-western China, comprising 12 prefecture-level cities and 2 autonomous prefectures (86 counties and districts), with the lowest GDP, and relatively low population density, within China. Furthermore, Gansu has complex terrain with mountains, plateaus, plains, and the Gobi Desert. On the other hand, Gansu Province is the key transportation hub connecting to five provinces in northwest China due to the special geographic location [8]. Epidemiological data show that COVID-19 is gradually being brought under control in Gansu Province, similar to other provinces in China that have reported a low level of infections. At March 2, 2020, in Gansu Province the total number of COVID-19 patients were 91, with two deaths and 87 recoveries. Consequently, the Gansu government decided at that time to lower the emergency response measures to COVID-19 from level 1 (top) to level III (low), primarily because there had been no new confirmed COVID-19 case for 14 consecutive days [9]. Thus, most students have been able to return back to schools now in Gansu, and most factories have also re-opened [10]. However, by March 22, 2020, in Iran the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 had increased to 20,610 and 1,556, respectively [11].",

The clearance of COVID-19 infection has been mainly due to the enforcement of stringent restriction orders, banning public activities, minimising outdoor activities, and enforcing mandatory facemasks. Of course, there is a substantial financial cost in terms of restriction of travel and social gathering, shopping and working. In addition, there is very high psychological stress accumulated over the nearly 6 weeks of lockdown amongst the general population in China, which should be taken into consideration [18]. Thus, with the improving situation of COVID-19 cases, the authorities from a number of major cities and/or provinces in China have been able to lift the restrictions orders, with the expectation that this will ease the people's anxiety and there will be a recovery from the business loss, commencing during April 2020 [19]. However, new COVID-19 cases have been identified amongst the overseas returnees from Italy, Iran and the United States [17], leading to reverse transmission cases of SARS-CoV-2 virus exceeding local cases from March 14, 2020 [20]. This phenomenon has been aggravated by the large numbers of overseas Chinese who have hastily returned to China in order to shelter from the risk of exposure to the SARS-CoV2 virus, based on the recognition that COVID-19 infection is almost under control in China [21]. Inevitably, such activities cause much concern about reverse transmission of COVID-19 to China.",

The 12% infection rate amongst the returnees was also much higher than that of a symptomatic secondary attack rate of 0.45% (95% CI = 0.12%\u20131.6%) among all close contacts [22], but similar to the symptomatic secondary attack rate of 10.5% (95% CI = 2.9%\u201331.4%) among household members in USA [22]. The authors acknowledge that the explanation for the higher infection rate among these 311 returnees may be mainly due to two possible reasons: firstly, the relative lack of self-protection or, secondly, lack of knowledge about COVID-19 concerning other procedures to limit spread, such as social distancing, sanitisation during the early stages of spread during their stay in Iran.",

The source of COVID-19 infection amongst these returnees may be from the study places at the University and/or the Mosques where they worshiped. During studies and/or worship, SARS-CoV-2 can easily be transmitted via close contact on the prayer mats or shaking hands, or even through breathing [24]. Thus, in attempts to stop the spread of the virus, Iranian authorities decided to limit inter-state travel between major cities by placing checkpoints and have halted the Friday prayers in all major cities till further notice [25]. Using the same approach has proven effective in controlling virus transmission in China over the last 6 weeks in combating the COVID-19 outbreak [21]. It has been reported that it may be possible for COVID-19 to be transmitted during flights, which has prompted the mandatory wearing of N95 facemasks for crew and passengers on any incoming flights to China, and when known positive COVID-19 cases are on-board, isolation in a screened-off section of the aircraft and the wearing of fully protective gowns, face masks and goggles [26]. Thus, during the repatriation flight and during the short interval in China prior to swab testing, stringent quarantine precautions were used, making infection during the repatriation flight and upon return to China unlikely. Nevertheless, this caveat needs to be acknowledged when trying to clearly identify and quantitate the infection source and spread range.",

Importantly the routine quarantine period of 14 days for COVID-19 may not be suitable for the returnees, because it has been reported that the longest incubation period of COVID-2019 in China can be up to 19 days [30] and infectivity may persist for up to 21 days even after an apparently asymptomatic infection [31]. Thus, a substantial threat could occur in the community if such COVID-19 case(s) are misdiagnosed and these returnees are allowed to eventually proceed to their final destination(s) after 14 days quarantine. Although the infection rate was high (12%), there was a relatively low severe/critical attack rate among these returnees from Iran with only 2 (5%), which was far below the results from Jiangxi Province (18%) [32] and Gansu Province (17.1%) within China [7]. However, this rate is close to the age-based rate published recently by Imperial College London of approximately 1.2% of patients requiring hospitalisation in the age range 20\u201329 years [33]. Our explanation for such a difference might be due to most of the returnees being young adults with relatively competent host defence. The majority of these returnees were male students, which may be mainly due to the Universities preference for religious study in Iran [34]. Interestingly, the attack rate of COVID-19 amongst females was rather less than male (1:4.5) in our current study, which is very different from the reports in the general population (1:1.1) in China [35]. A possible explanation for this difference may relate to the likely social roles undertaken by returnee women while in Iran, where female returnees may have predominantly undertaken domestic household and childcare duties, minimising their exposure to SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "There was 15% rate of COVID-19 cases amongst international students, which is substantially higher compared to the rate of infection amongst local Chinese students (9%) [7]. This discrepancy may be due to multiple factors, including the timing of the start of the spread of the infection and the earlier intervention and more rigorous measures taken by local Chinese students. For example, Chinese students had just started their winter vacation when the COVID-19 outbreak occurred in December 2019. Additionally, the enforcement of a restriction order in Gansu: mandatory to wear facemasks in public places, no public gathering and lockdown of Gansu from 28 January until further notice [36] is expected to have mitigated spread. Furthermore, the Ministry of Education enforced the subsequent suspension of the opening of schools and all classes have been conducted online to allow the students to stay at home, facilitating the battle against COVID-19 [37]. Such measures have effectively controlled the epidemic in schools. On the other hand, most of the international students in Iran lived in the school dormitories with several roommates and shared facilities. Another reason for the higher attack rate may be almost complete absence of precautions taken by the returnees prior to their returning back to Gansu Province, for example, only a small number of the students (12%) wore facemasks amongst those already identified or suspected of being sick students [38].",

We speculate that this observation may be related to several factors: firstly, returnees who chose to wear masks may have been involved in activities that placed them at greater risk of exposure, for example, living in dormitories, attending university classes and mosques. All three of these activities were identified in this study as increasing the risk of infection. By comparison, those returnees who chose not to wear masks may have been largely involved in low risk activities, for example, house-bound spouses engaged in domestic duties and childcare. Secondly, those who wore masks may have over-estimated the effectiveness of the masks in preventing infection, and thus may have neglected other measures to avoid infection, such as social distancing and scrupulous hygiene. Thirdly, the masks may not have met P2/N95 standards for use against viral infections and/or the technique for using the masks may have been inadequate, for example, touching the outside of the mask after use or multiple uses of the same mask. We note that recommendations concerning the mass wearing of masks remains controversial [39], and we urge caution in the application of our data in relation to this issue.",

Furthermore, the transmission routes is/are likely to still be similar to the local routes, i.e. the droplet inhalation and faecal-oral routes [40]. Currently, the quarantine approach used at the airport and/or on the airplane is primarily based on the measurement of body temperature only, which is unlikely to be sufficient; alternative more sensitive and specific screening approaches are urgently needed. However, we acknowledge that there does not seem to be another more appropriate screening measurement that is more sensitive and similar in cost available at this stage.",
