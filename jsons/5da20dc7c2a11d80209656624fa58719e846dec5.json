Similar to other coronavirus N proteins, SARS-CoV N protein is predicted to be phosphorylated and may contain nucleolar localization signals (NuLs), RNA binding domain, and regions responsible for selfassociation and homo-oligomerization. [1] [2] [3] [4] In this study, we identified Ubc9, a host protein involved in sumoylation, as a binding partner of the N protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen. This interaction was verified by GST pull-down assay, coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization of the two proteins in cells. Subsequent biochemical characterization studies demonstrate that SARS-CoV N protein is post-translationally modified by covalent attachment to the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO). The major sumoylation site was mapped to the 62 lysine residue of the N protein. Further expression and characterization of wild-type N protein and K62A mutant reveal that sumoylation of the N protein drastically promotes its homo-oligomerization. This is the first report showing that a coronavirus N protein undergoes post-translational modification by sumoylation and the functional implication of this modification in the formation of coronavirus ribouncleoprotein complex, virion assembly, and virus-host interactions.",

Promotion of oligomerization of protein by sumoylation has been speculated for a pathogenic protein, Huntingtin. 13 Because selfassociation and homo-oligomerization of N protein are essential for the assembly of nucleocapsid core, it suggests that sumoylation would play an important role in the SARS-CoV replication cycles.

The second possibility is that the sumoylated N protein may be not directly involved in the formation of dimmers and other oligomers. Instead, it may target the N protein to different cellular compartments and facilitate the oligomerization of the N protein. Further studies are required to address these possibilities.",
