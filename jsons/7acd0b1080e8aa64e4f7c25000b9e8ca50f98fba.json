The extent to which this increased risk relates to variation in pre-existing cardiometabolic comorbidities, differences in testing or hospitalization patterns, or additional disparities in social determinants of health warrants further study. 6 With respect to potential biologic factors, ongoing efforts seek to determine whether genetics--known to both vary substantially across racial groups and contribute to pre-existing comorbidities--plays an important role in COVID-19 disease severity.",
