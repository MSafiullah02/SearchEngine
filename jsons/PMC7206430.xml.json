            "text": "Disease outbreaks not only disrupt basic life activities and impede economic growth (McKibbin & Fernando, 2020; Smith, Keogh-Brown, & Barnett, 2011), they can also elicit both acute and long-term effects on individuals' well-being. In other words, the toll on individuals is not just physical and financial, but emotional as well. Many studies have consistently found relationships between the occurrence of infectious disease outbreaks and a host of psychological and behavioral consequences. Among the negative psychological consequences that have been most frequently reported are greater incidence of depression and psychological distress (Bai et al., 2004\nBults et al., 2011; Jones & Salath\u00e9, 2009; Shultz et al., 2016), worry (Thompson, Garfin, Holman, & Silver, 2017), functional impairment (Thompson et al., 2017), anxiety about being infected (Horney, Moore, Davis, & MacDonald, 2010; Jehn, Kim, Bradley, & Lant, 2011; Rubin, Potts, & Michie, 2010; Leggat, Brown, Aitken, & Speare, 2010), and reduced quality of life (van Hoek, Underwood, Jit, Miller, & Edmunds, 2011) and subjective well-being (Lau et al., 2008). In terms of behavioral consequences, exposure to outbreaks also resulted in preventive behaviors such as improved hygienic practices (Bults et al., 2011; Kiviniemi, Ram, Kozlowski, & Smith, 2011), seeking medical assistance (Lau et al., 2008, Lau, Griffiths, Au, & Choi, 2011) and engaging in social distancing and isolation (Setbon, Le Pape, L\u00e9troublon, Caille-Brillet, & Raude, 2011; Wong & Sam, 2010).",

            "text": "The above psychological and behavioral consequences are experienced by the broader workforce but perhaps more acutely by essential workers. In studies focusing on health care workers, they often report concerns about the (non) availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), personal safety, vaccine availability, caregiving responsibilities at home, and prioritizing the well-being of family members (e.g., Damery et al., 2009; Ives et al., 2009; Martin, 2011; Tippett et al., 2010). Psychological distress also occurs as result of mitigation strategies (e.g., social distancing, home containment, and travel restrictions) aimed to prevent the spread of the disease. For example, in a study of health care workers in a treatment facility during the SARS outbreak, Maunder et al. (2003) reported incidents of professional isolation arising from the use of protective masks and observance of non-physical contact with co-workers reduced morale among health care workers, and refusal to work among administrative and professional staff. Bai et al. (2004) investigated reactions of health care workers and professional staff shortly after 57 health care workers were quarantined due to the SARS epidemic. Results revealed that 20% of the participants reported feeling stigmatized, ostracized and rejected in their neighborhoods due to their hospital work while 9% expressed reluctance to return to work or had thoughts of quitting their job.",

These challenging work conditions often increase general health complaints such as fatigue, upset stomach, sleeping difficulties and headaches (Matsuishi et al., 2012; Shigemura, Ursano, Morganstein, Kurosawa, & Benedek, 2020). Additionally, school closures and suspension of religious activities (Baum, Jacobson, & Goold, 2009; Berkman, 2008; Cauchemez et al., 2009; Lee, 2020) arising from social distancing measures further exacerbate these adverse psychological difficulties and contributed to serious financial strain (Cauchemez et al., 2009; Chen, Huang, Chuang, Chiu, & Kuo, 2011).

The labor market conditions resulting from COVID-19 may also substantially alter career trajectories and impede job search strategies among individuals entering the workforce. Those in school-to-work transition contexts as well as younger workers face scarce employment and apprenticeship prospects that not only disrupt formal entry to the labor market but also delay the acquisition of career competencies (Berkman, 2008; Blake et al., 2010; International Labor Organization, 2020a, International Labor Organization, 2020b). In addition, findings from national surveys involving US workers before and after previous economic downturns show that those who remain employed may experience significant pay cuts, reduction in work hours, and prolonged furloughs while also facing increased work demand and challenging working conditions (Frone, 2018).",

In a study of 260 employed students, Diefendorff, Richard, and Yang (2008) found that employed young adults utilize several emotion regulation strategies to manage their negative emotions, including: a) seeking and reaching out to others to make them feel good; b) keeping oneself busy/working on other things; c) engaging in enjoyable activities to improve one's mood; and d) attempting to solve a problem. However, they also identified an important difference between the most commonly and least commonly reported strategies. The most commonly reported strategies involve an active approach to coping with difficult situations and negative emotions. Conversely, the least commonly used strategies reflect a passive and avoidance-oriented approach in managing difficult situations and negative emotions. This has led the authors to suggest that more proactive, approach-oriented emotion regulation strategies are likely to be more effective in helping employees manage their negative emotions than avoidance-based strategies. In other words, actively taking control of one's emotions, such as attending to one's feelings and actively seeking ways to improve them result in positive psychological outcomes.",

Specifically, emotion regulation may increase employees' motivation and willingness to plan for their career, take responsibility for their careers and work experiences, and explore their environment for opportunities.

First, the ability to resist emotional distractions and impulses enables individuals to focus and persist in pursuing difficult goals and recover from emotionally-demanding tasks (Sanz-Vergel, Demerouti, Moreno-Jim\u00e9nez, & Mayo, 2010). Therefore, employees who can successfully regulate their emotions may be more effective and efficient in completing their work goals despite having to suddenly transition their work to a home environment where many other distractions and demands may exist (Muraven & Baumeister, 2000). Second, emotion regulation has many social benefits as it facilitates positive social interactions and enhances relationship quality (Gross, 2014). For instance, emotion regulation cultivates empathy, compassion, and helping behavior toward others (Eisenberg, 2000; Lebowitz & Dovidio, 2015). In multi-wave data obtained from over 100 matched dual-career couples, Chen, Allen, and Hou (2020) found that mindful and empathic dual-career spouses enjoy more positive work-family experiences. Sharing pleasant and positive events with significant others elicits positive affective states that support employee, job and relationship satisfaction (Ilies, Keeney, & Scott, 2011).",

While the impact of pandemics/global health crises (e.g., SARS outbreak; Avian H5N1 strain; Ebola virus) on individuals' emotional and mental health has been frequently articulated in the literature (e.g., Bults et al., 2011; Maunder et al., 2003; Shultz et al., 2016), most of the research tends to be descriptive (e.g., documenting its deleterious effects on mental health) and prescriptive (e.g., offering ways to cope without testing their effectiveness) in nature. We are not suggesting that the prior work has less value or is insignificant. In fact, these studies serve as a foundation for setting the stage for a timely and pragmatic research agenda that utilizes more rigorous methods and analysis; one that enables us to study more closely and scientifically how working individuals can respond to a pandemic of this magnitude from an emotion regulation perspective. For example, do employees experience different types of emotions in response to this pandemic (e.g., sadness, anger, hopelessness, guilt, or even shame) and if so, why? How do the different types of negative emotions influence people's careers differently? Are there different ways to manage these distinct negative emotions?",

How do communities restore our strength and help us find meaning and connections in these dark times? Lastly, we have discussed the impact of this pandemic on employees' ability to manage family and work demands. While much has been said about how family and work demands can overwhelm and deplete individuals (Nohe, Meier, Sonntag, & Michel, 2015; Shockley & Singla, 2011), family life can also enrich work life and vice versa (Greenhaus & Powell, 2006). From this perspective, it would be relevant to examine how employees can learn emotion regulation skills and draw emotional energy from their family members (e.g., spouses) to enrich their well-being and personal effectiveness. Such a future research agenda should help identify a set of evidence-based ideas and practices about how the effective regulation of emotions can function to help employees not only cope, but perhaps even thrive during these challenging times. As we navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope that this commentary inspires research efforts to understand the consequences of global health crises such as this one from an emotion regulation perspective.",
