            "text": "The developing practice of using neonatal organs and tissues for research raises specific ethical and legal questions that beg for rational and transparent guidelines with which to evaluate referrals. This is especially true because of the rapidly increasing use of neonatal organs for research. To this end, a working group of scholars representing disciplines including bioethics, neonatology, obstetrics, and law, as well as professionals from Organ Procurement Organizations (OPO) and tissue banks including IIAM was formed. Neonatal donor families were also consulted. Its task was to consider the myriad of issues and to develop algorithms and policies for screening potential neonatal donors. Our primary goals were: (a) to ensure that referrals were evaluated in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, regulations, and institutional protocols; and (b) to follow acceptable ethical standards.",

Director of Research from the United Network for Organ Sharing Robert Carrico shares that since 2010, annual totals of neonatal organ donors in the United States, both from donation after brain death (DBD) and donation after circulatory death (DCD), have ranged from 3 to 21 donors annually. This represents between 0.03 and 0.21% of organ donors recovered in any given year. The donation of neonatal organs and tissues for research is even less common than for transplantation, primarily because family members who receive a pre-natal diagnosis of a lethal anomaly (LA) or experience the death of a neonate are not routinely offered information about research donation. Moreover, until recently researchers rarely sought neonatal organs and tissues.",

IIAM is a division of MTF Biologics, one of the largest non-profit providers of donated human tissues (e.g., musculoskeletal, dermal and placental). Founded in 1986, IIAM annually receives over 15,000 referrals of non-transplantable organs and tissues authorized for research from donors from U.S. OPOs. In the past 20 years, they have placed more than 14,000 research organs. Matching donors and research projects is a challenging process, as researchers have very specific donor criteria and logistics requirements. Research organs provided by IIAM are used by academic researchers as well as by pharmaceutical and medical device companies in the U.S. and abroad.",

Prior to this time, researchers had limited access to such organs and relied either on organs from adult donors or fetal tissue. No national guidelines or standards existed for the coordination of neonatal donation for research so referrals of potential neonatal donors were sporadic and managed on an ad hoc basis. They typically depended on the interest/capabilities of the individual OPO that would manage and coordinate the donation. As requests by expectant parents escalated, it became apparent that guidelines were necessary. The early interactions with expectant parents, OPO staff and researchers prompted the work that has resulted in this paper.",

Congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities were noted to be primary causes of neonatal death. One such congenital malformation is anencephaly, one of the most common central nervous system disorders. Anencephaly is a neural tube defect that occurs when the cephalic (head) end of the neural tube fails to close, usually between the 23rd and 26th days of pregnancy; this results in the absence of the major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp. Some rudimentary forebrain, a part of the brain consisting mainly of the cerebrum, may exist. A functioning brainstem is usually present. Prenatal diagnosis of anencephalic neonates typically occurs at 12\u201314 weeks. The majority of anencephalic pregnancies are terminated early in the pregnancy (Brierley 2010; Stiers et al. 2015). The CDC estimates that anencephaly annually affects approximately 3 pregnancies in every 10,000, or 1206 pregnancies (CDC 2015). Most anencephalic neonates die within days or weeks without life-supporting interventions (Shewmon 1989).",

Most OPOs have established \u201cclinical triggers\u201d for referral, which include variables such as Glasgow Coma Scale 5 or below, discussion of withdrawal of care, initiation of brain death testing, or cardiac arrest. In the context of ventilated neonatal donors, these clinical triggers may apply; in anencephalic donors, who are typically non-ventilated, they will not. The challenge, therefore, is to establish referral processes for practitioners working with the families of anencephalic neonates, to educate both OPO staff and donor hospital professionals about neonatal donation, and to implement protocols for both OPO and hospital staff to manage these cases. Sample protocols are available upon request to IIAM (www.iiam.org).",

Because the timing of a referral is quite different in the anencephalic donor, two variables come into play. First, the donor family may be several months short of the actual delivery and will have much more time to consider their options for donation. This is unusual and requires multiple follow-ups with a family over an extended period as their decision-making evolves. Second, the context of the discussions with perinatal and neonatal practitioners regarding the pregnancy and other related decisions is quite different from traditional organ donor situations, in which the discussion centers around brain death, withdrawal of care in a patient who is not brain dead and helping the family come to grips with the finality of the patient\u2019s brain injury.",

Surgical recovery is scheduled after organ evaluation and preliminary acceptance by a transplant center or, in the case of research donation, by a researcher.

Within 2 h, IIAM found researchers who were willing to accept her baby\u2019s liver and pancreas, and another researcher who was interested in receiving his entire body after organ donation. Their son, Amalya Nathaniel, lived for 80 min, surrounded by his parents, maternal and paternal grandparents, and other extended family members. The OPO performed the organ recovery after his death. As a result of his donation, researchers were able to evaluate pancreatic beta cells in their earliest stages of development, leading them to understand why some people develop Type 1 Diabetes; other researchers studied hepatocytes, which is critical to understanding cell generation. Images generated by his body led to FDA clearance for a medical device used for rapid pediatric resuscitation (Ardini-Poleske et al. 2017; Li et al. 2018; Gray 2016a, b, c, d, e, f, g).",

Pursuing this donation option requires careful attention to legal, ethical, medical, and procedural issues. It is vital to ensure that the integrity of the donation process be safeguarded, and that the desire to support neonatal donor families does not compromise ethical and legal standards. The comfort and solace that donation provides following the death of a neonate can be vital to families\u2019 healing processes and should be supported whenever possible. Given the potential legal and ethical barriers to donation and the fact that not all OPOs are currently equipped to provide this service even if the request falls within acceptable standards, it is important that families have realistic expectations with respect to donation opportunities.",
