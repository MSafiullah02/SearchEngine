[4] Although the mortality of cancer patients was higher than that reported in the Chinese studies, a direct comparison is not allowed for the lack of detailed information about anti-cancer treatment adopted and type of cancer. Moreover, as reported by Onder et al, a plausible explanation for the higher Italian case-fatality rate is based on defining COVID-19-related deaths independently from preexisting diseases that may have caused the death. [5] Therefore, whether this finding is secondary to cancer or a preexisting comorbidity is unknown.",

[9] Paradoxically, at this later stage a good general health may be disadvantageous for cancer patients and contrariwise a strong immunosuppression could lead to better outcomes. Beyond \"cytokine storm\" we should also consider the role of a multifactorial process to justify the rapid evolution of lung and multiorgan injury. We endorse the idea of a microvascular COVID-19 lung vessels obstructive thromboinflammatory syndrome (MicroCLOTS) as a new name for severe pulmonary coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) . In predisposed individuals, alveolar viral damage is followed by an inflammatory reaction and by microvascular pulmonary thrombosis. [10] This progressive endothelial thromboinflammatory syndrome may also involve the microvascular bed of the brain and other vital organs, leading to multiple organ failure and death. Future steps in the understanding of the disease and in the identification of treatments may benefit from this definition and hypothesized sequence of events.",

According to the current evidence, the limited sample size of cancer patients, especially for those actively receiving anticancer treatment, and the heterogeneous characteristics of patients included in published studies (up to May 4th, 2020), we think that data on cancer patients are still inconclusive. We agree with Trapani D. and colleagues that our goal, as oncologist, is to ensure the best possible support to our patients by taking further more detailed analyses to better understand the role of each anticancer drugs in the fight against COVID-19, and which kind of behavior we should adopt towards our patients rather than believing everything as evidence.
