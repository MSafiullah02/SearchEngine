An increase in incident cases of psychosis may be predicted. Clinical advice on the management of psychosis during the outbreak needs to be based on the best available evidence. We undertook a rapid review of the impact of epidemic and pandemics on psychosis. Fourteen papers met inclusion criteria. Included studies reported incident cases of psychosis in people infected with a virus of a range of 0.9% to 4%. Psychosis diagnosis was associated with viral exposure, treatments used to manage the infection, and psychosocial stress. Clinical management of these patients, where adherence with infection control procedures is paramount, was challenging.",

            "text": "The Corona Virus Disease 2019 outbreak started in China in December 2019, and by March 2020 had spread across the globe. While the development of a vaccine continues, public health strategies to contain the spread of the disease have been put in place in nearly every country (World Health Organization, 2020). These include quarantine (self-isolation) of people potentially exposed to the virus, and social distancing (more accurately termed 'physical distancing') of the general population (World Health Organization, 2020) . While physical distancing may be the most effective way of preventing the spread of the virus (Center for Disease Control et al., 2003) , this measure may be associated with a range of adverse psychological effects, including fear, anxiety, and worry (Brooks et al., 2020; Gardner and Moallef, 2015) , in addition to the physical effects of decreased motor activity, changes to diet, and exposure to sunlight (Lippi et al., 2020) . Such impacts are likely to differ across pandemics and populations, for example, Wang and colleagues (Wang et al., 2011) reported no immediate negative psychological effect of quarantine in their sample of University students in China during the H1N1 flu outbreak. The incidence of depression and anxiety in populations where physical distancing is enforced may be impacted (Brooks et al., 2020) and there has been media speculation around this issue, with some Governments actively recognising and funding mental health services to respond to this potential surge in mental ill-health (Zhou et al., 2020) . The implications for wellbeing are likely to be complex, however. Potential positives arising from the situation have also been speculated on, for example, a renewed sense of shared social purpose (Fransen et al., 2015) , such as, 'everyone is in this together', and 'we must all act to protect the vulnerable and the healthcare system'. There may also be short term benefits for individuals who experience social anxiety, with the expectation to stay at home, reducing typical stresses they experience from having to attend school or work, for example.",

For example, social isolation, unemployment, homelessness, relationship breakdown (divorce/separation), domestic violence, and worsening physical health, may all particularly effect people with psychosis given their vulnerability to social determinants of health (Anglin et al., 2020) . Again, the direction of this impact is not known as there is the potential for pandemics to strengthen social inequities and thus impact associated risk factors. There is also the potential for an increase in the number of people with psychosis who suicide or attempt suicide, with some evidence of an increase in the number of suicides occurring after previous pandemics (Chan et al., 2006) . What may complicate the interaction between psychosis and COVID-19 further is that the treatment of COVID-19 may involve the use of high doses of steroids to modulate the inflammatory response (Russell et al., 2020) ; steroids have been known to trigger psychotic symptoms (Wada et al., 2001) .",

Both of the patients in the Chang H1N1 case series were young (girl 14, and boy 13, years old) and were treated with an antiviral agent (oseltamivir) but not steroids.

Most patients were aware of the SARS epidemic. Compared to the control group, patients reported they were more protected from SARS in hospital, perceived that staff did all they could to protect them, and believed that there would be no SARS cases in Israel. Patients were also more likely to accept psychotic explanations for the SARS virus, such as it is a punishment, a sign the world is coming to an end, and a sign for humankind. For example, they reported that higher levels of reported anxiety in those with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f schizophrenia was associated with a reduced likelihood of perceiving they were at substantive risk from swine flu.

Given that we identified that people with psychosis are seemingly less adherent with protective measures it seems reasonable to hypothesise that during the COVID-19 outbreak -where a large number of people can expect to be infected -mental health clinicians will likely be in a position where they need to encourage patients to physically distance and self-isolate.",

Mental health care in these economies tend to already be neglected services and Governments and hospitals may have to be creative in their treatment delivery, perhaps expediting a move away from hospital-based care that can still dominate in these economies. Another novel shift in service provision could be making use of a peer-based workforce (Stastny, 2012) to reinforce infection control measures.",

Psychosis in patients with coronavirus may present a major challenge and potential infection control risk to clinical teams. There was limited evidence to suggest that patients that developed psychosis responded well to low dose antipsychotics such as aripiprazole. In addition to steroid-induced psychosis, there was some limited and poorquality evidence which suggested that extreme psychosocial stress-triggered incident cases in people previously unaffected. Of importance to current mental health service provision, patients with existing psychosis may be less likely to comply with physical distancing and personal hygiene requirements required during an outbreak of an infectious disease, representing a potential risk to the community and mental health clinicians.

Four (4.4%) participants were identified as experiencing post-SARS psychotic symptoms, with three other participants reporting transient auditory and visual hallucinations during admission for SARS treatment but did not meet diagnostic criteria. The authors report no details about the treatment and response.(Lee et al., 2004) undertook a retrospective chart review of SARS survivors in Hong Kong to test the hypothesis that post-SARS psychosis was associated with treatment with steroids.An incident rate of 0.9% (n=15) was reported in the 1,744 SARS patients reviewed for the study. They subsequently matched these to 30 control patients who had SARS but did not experience psychosis. All participants in the study were treated with steroids. Patients in the psychosis group received significantly higher doses of steroids while inpatient than controls (median dose in hydrocortisone equivalent, 10,975 mg v. 6,780 mg). The authors also suggest that a family history of mental illness and psychosocial stressor may have been associated with an increased risk of psychosis in their sample.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fIn the final observational study, we identified,(Kim et al., 2018) completed a retrospective chart analysis of all patients admitted to an acute MERS inpatient unit in Seoul, South Korea.Of the 24 MERS survivors, 17 (70.8%) exhibited psychiatric symptoms, of which 2 (11.8%) experienced auditory hallucinations.",

In returning outpatients, a slight decrease in incident cases of schizophrenia was reported. Increase in median age from 39 to 50 for those diagnosed with FEP.83% of inpatients had heard of the SARS epidemic. 33% of inpatients were worried about the threat compared to 50% of staff controls. Psychological reactions to SARS (anxious, depressed, frightened) were similar to a staff control group. Inpatients were significantly more likely to attribute SARS to their actions or as a message from God, than staff controls.One hundred forty-three patients seen in the first year of a new nurse-led mental health and psychosocial support service with inpatient liaison service and an outpatient clinic, developed in response to the Ebola outbreak that forced the closure of the psychiatric hospital to prevent disease transmission. 21% (30 patients) presented with psychosis requiring medication. During the Ebola outbreak, there were challenges getting affordable medication to those in need; as a result, \"some\" service users reported accessing alternative treatment such as traditional and faith healing.Of 40 admitted patients, 30 were confirmed MERS patients, of which six died. 17/24 MERS survivors had psychiatric symptoms. 2/17 patients experienced \"hallucinations\" and 2 \"aggressive outbursts\" but were not given a psychosis diagnosis. 3/17 patients had \"severe psychiatric disorder.\" None of the ten patients that did not have confirmed MERS experienced psychiatric symptoms. The authors proposed that a biopsychosocial model may explain the development of psychiatric symptoms in MERS patients.Of 1,744 patients with SARS, 15 with psychotic disorders were identified (incidence rate of 0.9%). 10/15 were diagnosed as a steroid-induced manic episode, 3/15 as steroid-induced psychotic disorder, 1/15 major depressive episode with psychotic features, 1/15 as psychotic disorder NOS. Patients with SARS related psychosis received higher total doses of steroids and had higher rates of family history of psychiatric illness.Compared to controls, people with schizophrenia were less willing to receive a vaccine and more concerned about adverse reactions from vaccination; they were also less willing to be isolated.
