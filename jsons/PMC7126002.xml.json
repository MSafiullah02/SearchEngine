Later in January 2004 the demonstration project was scaled-up as a national program. The program was officially named as \u201cpay-for-performance on Tuberculosis\u201d (P4P on TB). All diagnosis of \u201ctuberculosis\u201d (ICD-9-CM codes 010.0\u2013018.9) in Taiwan was included in this program, but multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases, extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) cases, and atypical mycobacterium tuberculosis cases were excluded. The BNHI set the objectives of pay-for-performance demonstration programs for TB to include: 1) improving the case management model; 2) decreasing the death rate from tuberculosis; 3) increasing the cure rate of tuberculosis; 4) improving the payment system to encourage health care providers to provide high quality treatment, and give them more responsibilities.",

In Tajikistan, vulnerable patients were given food, conditional on their adherence to treatment. The treatment success rate was 89.5% compared to 59.4% in non-incentive patients.8 From the provider incentive side, several countries also showed positive results. In China, providers would receive financial payment or monetary incentives when diagnosis or treatments have been completed. However, no related results are showed. Bangladesh provided travel, food and doctor handbag to TB treatment doctors, and the cure rate increased significantly to 88%.9\n",

As the results of comparing the default rate in 2004 and 2005, P4P hospitals or hospitals with case managers did not show lower default rate for migration of individuals. However, when the study only focused on the default cases, the migration cases were 3.31% and 3.11% of P4P hospitals and with case managers, respectively. Theses numbers were lower than non-P4P hospital and without case managers (6.17% and 4.56%, respectively). This revealed the function of case managers who monitor and update patients\u2019 information should be more strengthened. Once patients move to other cities, the case managers should transfer patients\u2019 information to next charged case managers.

The study from Singapore had similar findings in year 2000.37 Many studies concluded that higher compliance of TB treatment could be attributed to the presence of disease symptoms, because compliance is usually lower with treatment for asymptomatic conditions.38, 39 For the treatment of tuberculosis, the disease symptoms were usually resolved within the first 3 months of treatment. Thus patients may discontinue the treatment when they feel markedly better after the first 3 months of treatment.28, 40 This underscores the importance of TB patients\u2019 education on the need to complete the full course of treatment so as to prevent subsequent relapse. In addition, the ultimate responsibility for this can only lie on the treating physicians and case managers, whose role was not only to treat disease, but also to ensure that the patients adhere to and complete the treatment. Previous study suggested that reminding patients by clinics or hospitals are required to ensure the rate of complete treatment.41 Telephone reminders, use of incentives are effective methods.",
