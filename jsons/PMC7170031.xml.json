These opacities can be quite extensive in the sub-pleural areas (Figs. 1a, c, 2a and 3) or may be more focal, with a rounded shape (Fig 2b). Intralobular reticulations can be seen superimposed on the ground glass opacities, resulting in a crazy-paving pattern (Fig. 2e) which is usually associated with a more severe stage of the disease. Patients evaluated several days after the beginning of symptoms can present with linear consolidation (Figs. 1b, d and 2d) or areas with reverse halo appearances, both suggesting organizing pneumonia, which is a common reaction to lung injury [6]. Extensive consolidation is associated with a poorer prognosis in older patients (Fig 4c).",
