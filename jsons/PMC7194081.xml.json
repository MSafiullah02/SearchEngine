While this development has not been reflected in according variations in flows, greenfield investments have picked up again in 2018 (UNCTAD, 2019). Moreover, many (consumer) goods have become more homogeneous, in that increasingly similar items are produced and sold in different countries. This implies that knowledge about production techniques or distribution networks gained in one country can be utilised in another location as well. In consequence, the fixed costs of setting up a further production site abroad are likely to be lower than the costs of entering the first, domestic market. Hence, the incentives to undertake horizontal FDI have increased. Whether this development will continue after the coronavirus pandemic has subsided is hard to predict at the moment.",

Head and Spencer (2017), for example, commence their call for greater attention to oligopolies in the analysis of trade by asserting that \u201cOligopoly is pervasive in our daily live.\u201d (p. 1415). This statement can be accentuated by findings that concentration of industries has increased considerably in the United States in recent decades (Autor et al., 2017; Grullon et al., 2019), and hardly declined in European Union (Guti\u00e9rrez and Philippon, 2019). Accordingly, markets are far from being competitive and many industries feature oligopolistic characteristics. If big firms can cope with the consequences of the crisis commencing in 2020 more successfully than smaller firms, which may also receive less government aid, oligopolistic markets will become even more prevalent within the next years.",

We focus on a long-run, free entry setting which allows for adjustments also at the extensive margin to accommodate the fact that oligopolistic markets are not static but change their composition. In order to ease comparability with earlier investigations, we assume a homogeneous Cournot-oligopoly with identical firms, linear demand and cost schedules and fixed costs of market entry. In such a setting, the number of entrants will be excessive in a closed economy if entry reduces output per firm, that is, if there is business-stealing (von Weizs\u00e4cker and Christian, 1980, Mankiw and Whinston, 1986; Suzumura and Kiyono, 1987; Amir et al., 2014). We extend the analysis to a multi-country, two-period framework. In period one, there are only domestic competitors. At the beginning of period two, the market may be opened up to horizontal FDI. Entry costs arise in each period, whereas additional set-up costs only occur in the first period of activity and for one market. Therefore, incumbents that undertake FDI do not have to incur set-up costs again. This captures the idea that horizontal (greenfield) FDI activities can utilise knowledge gained in earlier domestic production, such that firms spread fixed costs over more markets and, thereby, greater quantities.",

            "text": "In order to focus on the effects of FDI, we consider two settings: In the first, entry is not regulated. Firms take up production, as long it is profitable. As FDI affects contemporaneous payoffs, market opening alters entry choices in the second period and, if anticipated, also first period decisions. In the second setting, the government regulates entry, for example, by granting costless entry licences. Because such regulation is no longer effective if market opening occurs in period two, it also changes the government's first period choice. In contrast to earlier analyses, we assume that the government maximises a political support function, and not necessarily welfare. This modification enables us to investigate how the nature of the government's objective affects choices. For both settings, the unregulated market equilibrium and the one in which entry is restricted, we initially consider a closed economy. This provides a benchmark, to which we compare outcomes, which will result if there is horizontal FDI.",

            "text": "Our analysis shows that the number of firms in a closed economy will be constant over time, though profits vary. This is true in market equilibrium and likewise if the government determines the maximum number of entrants. In this way, unit production costs are minimised. Moreover, and irrespective of the government's objective, entry usually is excessive, not only in the closed economy, but also if horizontal FDI takes place. The intuition is as follows: Opening the market in period two raises the number of firms in market equilibrium in that period and reduces it in period one. These adjustments result in an increase in total output and, hence, welfare. The expansion comes about because production costs per firm decline and the cost effect of the drop in the number of firms in period one dominates the impact of additional entry in period two. If the government regulates entry, the change in the number of firms will exhibit qualitatively the same features as in market equilibrium. Therefore, entry tends to be excessive also in the presence of FDI. We further show that market opening may actually decrease welfare if entry is regulated. Such outcome can occur if the number of firms is relatively high prior to market opening. Therefore, the increase in output and consumer surplus due to market opening is limited and does not compensate the reduction in profits. Finally, we demonstrate that even if market opening raises welfare, the government's payoff may decline. This can be the case if the fall in profits because of intensified competition is substantial, while the rise in consumer surplus is not valued sufficiently by the government.",

Fourth, we evaluate in how far the government's incentives to regulate entry depend on whose interests it pursues.",

Marjit and Mukherjee (2013, 2015) and Mukherjee (2013) assume that there is one foreign firm which enters the domestic oligopoly. They show that if trade costs decline, so do the foreign firm's costs, such that it produces a greater amount. This, in turn, reduces profits of domestic firms and deters their entry. Moreover, the number of firms in market equilibrium may be insufficient. The rationale for this outcome is that a government, which maximises domestic welfare, takes into account that additional entry raises domestic consumer surplus at the expense of foreign profits. However, this cross-country effect plays no role for the firms' entry decision in market equilibrium.1\nIf input prices are given by wages determined by a trade union, lower transport cost may reduce welfare and entry is once again insufficient (Marjit and Mukherjee, 2013, 2015). The latter effect arises because wages deter entry, but do not have a direct welfare effect (see de Pinto and Goerke (2020) for a similar approach).",

Moreover, if entry costs are high, there are few competitors. Allowing for trade intensifies competition substantially. This trade effect exceeds the negative consequences of excessive entry. Hence, trade raises welfare. If market entry costs are low, the gains from trade are also relatively moderate, such that the excessive entry distortion dominates and welfare declines.2\n",

Trade raises welfare in comparison to autarky despite the occurrence of trade costs because fixed costs of entry can be distributed across a greater quantity (see, for example, Brander and Paul, 1983; Venables and Anthony, 1985). Under additional conditions, which hold for a linear demand schedule, the total number of suppliers rises, but not necessarily of domestic firms (Venables and Anthony, 1985; see also Anderson et al., 1989). Tanaka (1993) considers a two-country free-trade setting. The introduction of a tariff raises welfare if demand is strictly concave. This effect occurs because the number of firms decreases, as Ikeda (2007) clarifies. In partial contrast, Amir et al. (2019) show that free trade can raise welfare and reduces the number of firms in a world without trade costs, such that international competition results in fully integrated markets. Finally, St\u00e4hler (2006) assumes a two-period setting in which domestic and foreign firms can enter their home market in period one and export part of their production. In period two, only incumbents can undertake horizontal FDI. He shows that exports and FDI may co-exist. In this case, the number of firms shrinks with FDI, while welfare rises, for example, if demand is linear.",

In market equilibrium this decision is determined by the level of profits. If the government regulates entry, a firm additionally requires a licence to take up production. At the beginning of period two, firms choose whether to continue production domestically or whether to take it up, if they had not done so in the previous period. Moreover, markets may be opened up. In this case, firms can undertake horizontal FDI, i.e. enter foreign markets by greenfield investments.

The increase in welfare due to the resulting ascent in consumer surplus in period two is partially balanced by a decline in period one. It occurs because set-up costs cannot be distributed over both periods, such that entry costs in period one rise. In consequence, the government lowers the number of entrants in that period.

This beneficial impact of horizontal FDI is mitigated or dominated by the increase in the number of firms. Such increase entails a welfare loss due to the business stealing externality. In particular, we compare the unregulated market equilibrium with a situation in which governments can restrict entry at least in the first period.

In a closed economy, the number of firms in market equilibrium is too high. Therefore, welfare is less than maximal because of the excessive entry distortion and the firms' market power. If the market is opened up, the number of firms in market equilibrium in period one declines, while the increase in period two is relatively moderate because there had already been excessive entry. Therefore, total fixed costs born by domestic firms decline. Moreover, consumer surplus rises. The latter effect ensures that market opening raises welfare in market equilibrium. If, however, the government determines the number of firms in a closed economy, the entry distortion is much less pronounced, unless the weight of consumers in the government's objective is sufficiently large. Market opening brings about too many competitors in period two. Hence, welfare declines on account of the business-stealing externality and higher market entry costs in period two. This effect is slightly mitigated by the fall in the number of firms producing in period one. The rise in consumer surplus will only dominate if the excessive entry distortion introduced by market opening is not too large. Moreover, the countervailing effects in a situation in which the government determines entry also explain why welfare may decrease. Put differently, the feature that the welfare loss due a free-entry Cournot-oligopoly in a closed economy is relatively small if entry is regulated, reduces the gross gain from market opening and raises the negative impact. Hence, market opening may have a negative welfare impact.",

This is the case because an equivalent variation of profits and consumer surplus in the opposite direction will leave welfare constant, whereas this will generally not be the case for the government's payoff. Because market opening tends to reduce profits if entry is regulated, a government is more likely to oppose it the greater the firms' weight in the government's objective is.

In future work, it may be worthwhile to explore in how far they affect the theoretical predictions. As one example, the weight of the consumers' and firms' payoffs in the government's objective is exogenous and constant. However, it could be argued that the respective parameters are endogenous and depend on the payoffs obtained. This would imply that market opening affects the relative importance given to consumer surplus and profits when determining competition policy (see Hillman and Ursprung (1993) for an according approach idea in the context of trade policy). Since market opening tends to reduce aggregate profits, the consumers' interests may then become more important for entry regulations. As a second example, we have not allowed for exporting activities. However, if the good under consideration could be transported across borders easily, this restriction can no longer be justified. The findings of Miyagiwa and Sato (2014) suggest that there will also be excessive entry if firms can export their products, but not undertake FDI. The combination of both activities, exporting and investing abroad may have different consequences if interaction effects occur (see Helpman et al., 2004 and Markusen and Frank, 2011). Third, we have assumed horizontal FDI, whereas a substantial fraction of such investments relate to vertical activities. Fourth, we have considered a case of market opening in which the government can no longer affect entry decisions by firms. However, it is feasible that market opening goes hand in hand with international cooperation of competition authorities which could indirectly restrict horizontal FDI. Finally, we have limited the set of policy instruments to (costless) entry licences. If the government could use fiscal incentives to influence entry and output decisions, it could also employ them to redistribute income from consumers to firms or vice versa. This would further affect its payoff, unless it aimed to maximise welfare. In sum, the above analysis does not (yet) provide a framework for comprehensive policy advice.",
