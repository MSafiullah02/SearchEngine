            "text": "Virus discovery programmes based on molecular cloning have been increasingly successful in the identification and genetic characterisation of a wide range of novel viruses infecting humans and animals. Examples of viruses infecting humans discovered by such techniques include the parvoviruses, human bocavirus (HBoV) and PARV4 (Allander et al., 2005, Jones et al., 2005), anelloviruses (Nishizawa et al., 1997, Jones et al., 2005), hepatitis G virus or GB virus C (Linnen et al., 1996, Leary et al., 1996), following on from earlier discoveries of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) (Choo et al., 1989, Chang et al., 1994). While in many cases their discovery could be directly linked to a specific disease syndromes (non-A, non-B hepatitis for HCV; Kaposi's sarcoma for HHV-8), others have much more tenuous links with human disease. Indeed, subsequent investigations of their epidemiologies, transmission routes and disease associations have often proven to be major challenges. There is an ongoing effort, for example, to determine precisely whether HBoV is a significant cause of childhood respiratory disease, why it is so often co-detected with other respiratory pathogens, and whether it exclusively a respiratory virus (reviewed in (MacIntosh, 2006, Mackay, 2007). Disease associations of PARV4 are even less well defined (Simmonds et al., 2007).",

They are related members of a new group (or possibly sub-family) within the Polyomaviridae, small DNA viruses with circular, covalently closed double-stranded DNA genomes infecting a wide range of mammalian and avian species. Polyomaviruses show narrow host specificities, and frequently establish persistent, lifelong infections characterised by highly restricted or latent infection. Infections with the two known human polyomaviruses, BK virus (BKV) and JC virus (JCV) are acquired through the respiratory routes at a young age, achieving seroprevalences of 75% or greater by adulthood (Stolt et al., 2003). Both spread systemically and establish sites of persistent infection in the kidneys and the central nervous system in the case of JCV. Disease associations of BKV and JCV are rare and are almost invariably associated with immunodeficiency. Lack of immune control of virus replication and the consequent greater likelihood of acquiring mutations in transcription control regions (Ault and Stoner, 1993, Chatterjee et al., 2000) triggers unregulated replication leading to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy by JCV, and renal disease by BKV (Coleman et al., 1978, de Silva et al., 1995).",

Investigations to date have been based on large scale screening of respiratory samples referred for diagnostic testing from patients generally with moderate to severe respiratory disease. It is, however, difficult to assess the frequency of asymptomatic infection with these viruses, or indeed, whether WUV or KIPyV played an aetiological role in the respiratory diseases of patients from whom they were obtained. In the current study, we have screened an existing archive of respiratory specimens with accompanying epidemiological and clinical information to determine prevalences of infection with WUV and KIPyV. The archive also included a sub-group of samples from children and adults with no respiratory disease, thus providing a control group to assess more critically their aetiological role in respiratory disease.",
