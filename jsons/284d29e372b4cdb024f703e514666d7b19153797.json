Some of common existing drugs like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), 36 angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ('statins') have 37 been hypothesised to impact on disease severity. However, up till now, no studies investigating 38 this association were conducted in the most vulnerable and affected population groups, i.e. older 39 people residing in nursing homes. The purpose of this study has been to explore the association 40 of ACEi/ARB and/or statins with clinical manifestations in COVID-19 infected older people 41 residing in nursing homes. 42 Methods and Findings. We undertook a retrospective multi-centre cohort study in two Belgian 43 nursing homes that experienced similar COVID-19 outbreaks. COVID-19 diagnoses were 44 based on clinical suspicion and/or viral presence using PCR of nasopharyngeal samples. A total 45 of 154 COVID-19 positive subjects was identified.

Moreover, there is no information on when 238 sufficient vaccine supplies will become widely available. Recently, the World Health 239 Organization (WHO) communicated a Solidarity \"megatrial\" evaluating four broad-spectrum 240 antiviral agents. Among them, the broad-spectrum experimental antiviral drug remdesivir was 241 shown to have low efficacy against Ebola and dropped from further study, although a recent 242 report of its compassionate use in serious COVID-19 was favourable (27). Lopinavir and 243 ritonavir (a protease inhibitor combination used to treat HIV patients) were ineffective in a 244 Chinese clinical trial (28). A lot of attention has gone to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. 245 Unfortunately prospects for their success against COVID-19 are not good (29). Convalescent 246 sera, obtained from recovered COVID-19 patients, might be an option to treat acute COVID-247 19 infections (30), but its implementation will be cumbersome and unlikely to become widely 248 available. The first clinical trials of ACEi/ARB and statin treatments in hospital settings have 249 been initiated within the past month. While we await the results of these trials, which are 250 expected in 2021, this retrospective study should be regarded as both timely and 251 complementary, as it has focused on a frail, non-hospitalised population and demonstrated 252 clinical findings on the use of ACEi/ARB/statins using real world data. 253 Although statistically not significant, overall both ACEi/ARB and statins show clinical 254 beneficial odds ratios for the outcome serious COVID-19 in elderly people who live in nursing 255 homes.

In Belgium, a country with a well-developed health care system, 3000 residents of nursing homes have died from COVID-19, with still around 100 residents a day currently dying 89 (20).
