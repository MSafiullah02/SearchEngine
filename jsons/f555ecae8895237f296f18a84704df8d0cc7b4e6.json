Since then, structure-function studies of SARS-CoV proteins have provided a wealth of information that increases our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of SARS. While no effective therapy is currently available, considerable efforts have been made to develop vaccines and drugs to prevent SARS-CoV infection. In this review, some of the notable achievements made by SARS structural biology projects worldwide are examined and strategies for therapeutic intervention are discussed based on available SARS-CoV protein structures. To date, 12 structures have been determined by X-ray crystallography or NMR from the 28 proteins encoded by SARS-CoV. One key protein, the SARS-CoV main protease (M pro ), has been the focus of considerable structure-based drug discovery efforts. This article highlights the importance of structural biology and shows that structures for drug design can be rapidly determined in the event of an emerging infectious disease.",

            "text": "In 2003, a previously unidentified coronavirus, termed SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was the aetiological agent for the worldwide epidemic responsible for approximately 8000 reported cases and 800 deaths (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003) , and its emergence was attributed to an animal-to-human interspecies transmission (Prentice et al., 2004) . Coronaviruses are characterized as enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses with the largest known genomes and belong to the genus Coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . Approximately 26 species of coronaviruses (CoVs) have been identified to date and can be classified into three distinct groups on the basis of genome sequence and serological reaction (Lai & Holmes, 2001; Spaan & Cavanagh, 2004) . Prior to the SARS outbreak, very little attention was paid to the structure-function studies of coronavirus proteins by researchers as this genus of virus predominantly causes severe diseases in animals but comparatively mild diseases in humans, such as common colds caused by human coronaviruses. While extensive research had been carried out on model coronaviruses over the previous 20 years or so, little was understood about underlying mechanisms such as viral assembly and viral replication/transcription before the SARS outbreak. No licensed drugs are currently available and strategies against coronavirus infection relied mainly on vaccines prior to the outbreak of SARS.",

Many of the 28 SARS-CoV proteins share low sequence similarity with other proteins, including those from other viruses, indicating their uniqueness and hampering functional assignment based on homology.

These enzymes are typically not available or accessible in the host cell and are thus identified as potential targets for anti-SARS drug design. They include: an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, nsp12), a 3C-like cysteine protease (M pro or 3CL pro , nsp5), a papain-like protease (PL pro , nsp3), and a superfamily 1-like helicase (HEL1, nsp13). The replicase gene also encodes proteins less commonly found in positive-strand RNA viruses, which are indicative of 3 0 -5 0 exoribonuclease activity (ExoN homolog, nsp14), endoribonuclease activity (XendoU homolog, nsp15), adenosine diphosphate-ribose 1 00 -phosphatase activity (ADRP, nsp3) and ribose 2 0 -O-methyltransferase activity (2 0 -O-MT, nsp16) (Snijder et al., 2003) . These enzymes may therefore be related to the unique properties of coronavirus replication and transcription. Finally, the replicase gene encodes another nine proteins, of which little is known about their structure or function. Given the vital role of the replicase proteins in the viral life cycle, elucidating their function and how they interact to form the replicase complex is essential for determining strategies for the design of anti-viral compounds. However, further structural and functional studies of the replicase complex are still required for the discovery of anti-CoV therapeutics.",

The M pro acts on 11 of the 14 cleavage sites on the replicase polyprotein to release the individual components of the replicase complex, and is therefore a critically important target for the discovery of anti-viral therapeutics. The coronavirus M pro structures are characterized by two chymotrypsin-like -barrel domains, similar to other viral proteases, and an additional C-terminal globular -helical domain (Anand et al., 2002 Yang et al., 2003) .

Our group has designed peptidomimetic ester inhibitors based on the natural N-terminal autocleavage substrate of the SARS-CoV M pro and optimized using a structure-based approach (Fig. 3a ) . Furthermore, owing to the remarkable conservation of the active sites across all three coronavirus antigenic groups, our compounds have broadspectrum activity against all coronavirus M pro . Other classes of compounds found to have activity against coronavirus M pro include anilides (Shie et al., 2005) , hexachlorophene and its analogues (Hsu et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2005) , natural polyphenols , isatin derivatives (Chen, Wang et al., 2005) , cinanserin (a serotonin agonist) (Chen, Gui et al., 2005) , interferons (Tan et al., 2004) , keto-glutamine analogues (Jain et al., 2004) , zinc conjugated compounds (Hsu et al., 2004) , aryl boronic acid compounds (Bacha et al., 2004) , quercetin-3-b-galactoside and its synthetic derivatives , plant terpenoids and lignoids (Wen et al., 2007) , benzotriazole esters , coumarin derivative (Hamill et al., 2006) , and other compounds (Kaeppler et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2006; Tsai et al., 2006) .

Two crystal structures of the functional enzymatic domains of nsp3 have been determined: the 'X' domain with proposed ADP-ribose-1 00 -phosphate dephosphorylation (ADRP) activity (Saikatendu et al., 2005; Egloff et al., 2006) and the papain-like protease (PL pro ) domain (Ratta et al., 2006) . The 'X' domain, also known as the ADRP domain, is conserved among all CoV (Putics et al., 2005) and is structurally related to macro-H2Alike fold proteins (Fig. 2b) . Interestingly, the work by Egloff and colleagues suggests that this 'X' domain actually has poor ADRP activity and efficiently binds poly(ADP-ribose) instead , and its role in the viral life cycle remains unclear. Coronaviruses generally feature two papain-like protease (PL pro ) domains in nsp3, termed PL1 pro and PL2 pro . However, SARS-CoV encodes only one PL pro domain. Its structure was found to possess a 'thumb-palm-fingers' fold related to known deubiquitinating enzymes (Fig. 2c) . However, certain key features of nsp3 PL pro include a zincbinding motif and a ubiquitin-like N-terminal domain, separating it from other characterized deubiquitinating enzymes. The availability of the nsp3 PL pro structure helps to delineate the proteolytic processing at the consensus (LXGG) cleavage site and provides details at the molecular level for the mechanism of deubiquitination, suggesting an important dual role for this enzyme.",

Nsp7 (Fig. 2d), nsp8 (Fig. 2e ) and the nsp7-nsp8 complex (Fig. 3b) all have novel structures, and nsp8 exists in two distinct conformations in the structure. The inner dimensions and electrostatic properties of the cylindrical nsp7-nsp8 structure enable it to encircle nucleic acid, suggesting that the nsp7-nsp8 complex might be a processivity factor for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12). A follow-up study by Imbert and colleagues (Imbert et al., 2006) reported that nsp8 constitutes a second RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in addition to nsp12, which includes an RdRp domain conserved in all RNA viruses. Further activity assays confirmed that nsp8 recognizes specific short sequences in the ssRNA coronavirus genome and most likely functions as a primase to catalyze the synthesis of RNA primers for the primer-dependent nsp12, which is a unique characteristic of coronaviruses. Interestingly, a recent study has also shown that nsp8 can interact with the orf6 accessory protein (Kumar et al., 2007) , implying that the replication of SARS-CoV involves a rather complicated network of many proteins.",

Searches for structural homology revealed that nsp9 shares similarity with certain subdomains of serine proteases, including domain II of the SARS-CoV M pro . Their similarity to the picornavirus 3C proteases, which feature a conserved RNA binding motif, indicated that nsp9 should bind also ssRNA. In addition to its role in the viral replication cycle, possible functions for nsp9 may be in stabilizing nascent and template RNA strands during replication and transcription to protect them against nuclease processing, or in base-pairing-driven processes such as RNA processing.",

These zinc finger motifs are strictly conserved among the three coronavirus groups, implying an essential function for nsp10 in all coronaviruses, and a PFAM search yields a match with the previously uncharacterized HIT-type zinc finger proteins. While zinc finger proteins often play a role in transcription, the precise function of nsp10 in the viral life cycle remains to be determined. The location of nsp10 next to the RNAinteracting proteins nsp8 and nsp9 in the SARS-CoV genome would suggest that nsp10 should also interact with nucleic acid. However, our experiments and those of Joseph and colleagues found only weak affinity between nsp10 and both ssRNA and dsRNA. Further work is also needed to ascertain the significance of the oligomeric state of SARS-CoV nsp10 determined by our group. We used a construct of nsp10 and nsp11 for crystallization, although nsp11, an 11 amino acid peptide, was not observed in the subsequent structure . The exact function of nsp11 in viral replication and transcription remains largely unknown.",

Nsp15 is the first member of the XendoU family of endoribonucleases to be characterized, providing the first structural and mechanistic characteristics for this family of enzymes. The nsp15 monomer structure has a novel fold and consists of three subdomains: a small N-terminal domain formed by two -helices packed against a three-stranded -sheet; a middle domain comprising a mixed -sheet, two smaller -sheets and two short -helices; and a C-terminal domain made up of two -sheets and five -helices (Fig. 2h) . In the shortened monomeric structure of nsp15 reported by Joseph and colleagues, the catalytic loop flips back to occupy the active site cleft due to the absence of monomer-monomer interactions. Given the critical importance of nsp15 in the viral life cycle, it is therefore an attractive target for anti-viral drug design. Potential strategies for inhibitor design include active site inhibitors, peptidomimetics or non-peptidyl compounds that mimic the catalytic loop of nsp15, and compounds that disrupt formation of the hexamer species.",

The SARS-CoV genome encodes four structural proteins that are required to drive cytoplasmic viral assembly: the spike (S) protein, the membrane (M) protein, the nucleocapsid (N) protein and the envelope (E) protein. More recently, two proteins originally labelled as accessory proteins have been reclassified as structural proteins. Orf3a is believed to be a minor structural protein with three membrane-spanning helices (Ito et al., 2005; Shen et al., 2005) and reports suggest it interacts with the spike protein and may influence its trafficking in the host cell (Tan, 2005) . Orf7a, an integral membrane protein expressed on the membrane surface of host cells infected with the SARS virion, has also been suggested to be a structural protein . The structure of the soluble luminal domain of orf7a has been determined, although the function of the full-length protein remains unclear (Nelson et al., 2005) .",

A common fusion mechanism has since been established from extensive structural studies on the viral families of orthomyxovirus, retrovirus, paramyxovirus and filovirus (Eckert & Kim, 2001) . The SARS-CoV S protein is typical of class I virus fusion proteins in that it can be divided into an N-terminal half (S1), which binds the host cellular receptor, and a C-terminal half (S2), responsible for cell entry via virus-cell membrane fusion (Gallagher & Buchmeier, 2001; Supekar et al., 2004) . S2 contains two hydrophobic (heptad) repeat regions, HR1 and HR2 (de Groot et al., 1987) , which assemble into a sixhelix bundle with three HR2 helices surrounding a central coiled coil of three HR1 helices in an oblique and antiparallel manner. Structures of the spike (S) protein fusion core have been reported by three groups in the post-fusion (or fusionactive) state (Fig. 3c) (Supekar et al., 2004; Duquerroy et al., 2005) . The N terminus of HR1 and the C terminus of HR2 locate at the same end of the six-helix bundle, which places the fusion peptide and transmembrane region in close proximity. Fusogenic mechanisms mediated by SARS-CoV were proposed from these structures according to those of other class I fusion proteins, although further struc-tural studies are needed to determine the possible conformational changes of the HR1 and HR2 fusion peptides during the membrane fusion process.",

In the case of SARS-CoV, the S1 region of the S protein binds to cellular receptors, including the known receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Li et al., 2003) . Stephen Harrison and colleagues determined the structure of the SARS-CoV S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD, covering residues 318 to 510 of the S protein) with the known cellular receptor ACE2 (Fig. 3d) . The RBD is the critical determinant of virus-receptor interaction and thus of viral host range and tropism. ACE2 specifically recognizes the SARS-CoV RBD by surface complementarity via a well defined interface; the opposite face of the RBD which interacts with the rest of the spike protein is more disordered. As revealed by the authors, the interface between the two proteins shows important residue changes that facilitate efficient cross-species infection and human-tohuman transmission. ACE2 is highly conserved in mammals and birds, and its receptor activity for SARS-CoV can be markedly affected by only a few amino acid substitutions at the virus binding site. Subtle changes in the RBD residues at positions 479 and 487 in human coronaviruses can increase affinity for human ACE2. Palm civet coronaviruses have lysine in position 479 and serine in position 487, for instance, which reduce affinity for human but not palm civet ACE2. The authors further suggest engineering truncated disulfide-stabilized RBD variants for use in the design of coronavirus vaccines.",

First, the structure of the RNA binding domain from the SARS-CoV N protein consists of a five-stranded -sheet whose fold is unrelated to other RNA binding proteins Saikatendu et al., 2007) . The structure of the N protein RNA binding domain might constitute another significant target, since the discovery of small molecules that bind to the RNA binding domain should impair the function of the nucleocapsid . Since specific packaging of the viral genome into the virion is a critical step in the life cycle of an infectious virus, this RNA binding domain might be a viable target for the design of anti-viral therapeutics. Second, the full-length N protein forms a dimer via its C-terminal domain, and a crystal structure of this so-called dimerization domain covering residues 270-370 has been reported (Yu et al., 2006) .

These accessory proteins are poorly characterized structurally and their functions are largely unknown, and so it is not clear if the accessory proteins may be viable targets for anti-viral drug discovery. However, it was recently suggested that the accessory proteins orf3a and orf7a should be reclassified as structural proteins (Ito et al., 2005; Shen et al., 2005; . As the accessory proteins vary among different coronaviruses, they almost certainly would not be targets for the design of broad-spectrum anti-virals. Two accessory protein structures have been determined to date: the orf7a luminal domain (Nelson et al., 2005) and orf9b, a lipid-binding protein (Meier et al., 2006) .",

S2m is a rigorously conserved motif located at the 3 0 end of SARS-CoV and the genomes of other viral pathogens (Jonassen et al., 1998) but is not found in the human genome. The highly structured s2m RNA element includes a striking 90 bend in the helix axis. Several longer-range tertiary interactions create a tunnel perpendicular to the main helical axis, with a negatively charged interior that binds two Mg ions. These unusual features form likely surfaces for interaction with conserved host-cell components or other reactive sites required for virus function. The authors suggest that s2m RNA is a functional macromolecular mimic of the 530 loop of 16S rRNA, a ribosomal RNA fold (Wimberly et al., 2000) , suggesting a mechanism for RNA hijacking of host protein synthesis similar to other RNA viruses (Bushell & Sarnow, 2002) . The 530 loop of the 30S ribosome binds to the prokaryotic proteins S12 and IF-1, further suggesting that s2m may interact with their eukaryotic homologs (Robertson et al., 2005) . Nevertheless, the high sequence conservation of s2m in an otherwise rapidly changing RNA genome implies its pathogenic importance. The structural features of s2m, coupled with the fact that it is not found in the human genome, signals that it could be another attractive target for the design of antiviral therapeutics. Compounds designed to bind to s2m might disrupt the structure and thus inhibit SARS-CoV pathogenesis.",

Several strategies have been used to develop vaccines, including inactivated viruses, subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs), DNA vaccines, heterologous expression systems, and vaccines derived from SARS-CoV genome by reverse genetics [see Gillim-Ross & Subbarao (2006) for a recent review]. As described above, the S protein RBD could be used as a starting point for the development of a vaccine, since neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV recognize epitopes in the RBD. As suggested by the crystal structure, a candidate vaccine could be made by engineering the SARS-CoV RBD to improve stability . In another example, the antigenic peptides of the coronavirus N protein are accessible on the surface of infected cells for T-cell recognition (Boots et al., 1991; Bergmann et al., 1993) . Furthermore, in 2005, the crystal structure of the human MHC-I (major histocompatibility complex I) molecule HLA-A*1101 in complex with a nine amino acid peptide (KTFPPTEPK) derived from the SARS-CoV N-protein, was determined by X-ray crystallography to 1.45 \u00c5 resolution (Blicher et al., 2005) . Although it is similar to other MHC-I molecules and shows a similar peptide binding mode, the structure adds to the growing library of MHC-I structures and could be used as a template for peptide-based vaccine design.",

A deletion in the nsp1 coding sequence in MHV was found to strongly reduce cellular gene expression, while low doses of nsp1 mutant MHV elicited potent cytotoxic T-cell responses (Zust et al., 2007) . Furthermore, mice inoculated with the nsp1 mutant MHV were protected against homologous and heterologous virus challenge.

            "text": "Structure-function studies of SARS-CoV proteins have significantly advanced our understanding of coronaviruses and should accelerate structure-based discovery of anti-viral therapeutics. However, a number of important targets remain to be elucidated, most notably among the replicase proteins. These include several membrane proteins and large multidomain proteins and their structures will be challenging to determine. Foremost among these protein targets is undoubtedly nsp12, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Canonical polymerase sequence motifs can be identified in the C-terminal part of the RdRp, while coronaviral RdRp feature a unique N-terminal region of 380 amino acids with unknown function (Xu et al., 2003) . Despite numerous attempts by several groups, the SARS-CoV RdRp has proven to be difficult to produce in sufficient quantities for crystallization. The RdRp of other RNA viruses have been major targets for antiviral compounds. For instance, NS5A is the RdRp in hepatitis C virus (HCV) and a major target for nonnucleoside inhibitors (NNI) (Biswal et al., 2005 (Biswal et al., , 2006 . The binding sites for thiophene-based NNIs are located in the 'thumb' domain of NS5B, in close proximity to the allosteric GTP binding site and approximately 35 \u00c5 from the active site. This part of the 'thumb' domain apparently has an important regulatory function that is modulated by GTP and NNIs. Interestingly, nsp8 is also believed to form a second RdRp for the synthesis of short RNA primers for nsp12. Since this function is unique to coronaviruses, the nsp8 primase may be an effective and specific target for anti-coronavirus therapeutics. Another major target is nsp13, the helicase, whose role is to unwind double-stranded genomic and subgenomic RNA during the replication process and whose three-dimensional structure remains to be determined. Nsp12 and nsp13, together with nsp5 (M pro ), share the highest sequence conservation among the three coronavirus groups and should be the focus of broad-spectrum anti-viral drug discovery .",

            "text": "To date, the structure-based discovery of anti-coronavirus therapeutics has been focused in two main areas: blocking viral entry into the host cell or inhibiting viral replication and transcription via the replicase complex. In the former case, the availability of SARS-CoV S protein fusion core structures will enable the design of inhibitors that block viral entry by targeting the pre-fusion hairpin intermediate. Structural differences between the SARS-CoV and MHV S protein fusion cores suggest that inhibitors designed to target the SARS-CoV S protein fusion core should be less efficient against other coronaviruses. In the latter case, three highly conserved proteins have been identified thus far among coronaviruses: nsp5, the M pro ; nsp12, the RdRp; and nsp13, the helicase. Targeting these three proteins should enable the design of anti-coronavirus therapeutics with broad-spectrum activity. In the event of a new emerging coronavirus, the availability of broad-spectrum inhibitors should provide a first line of defence until vaccines become available. However, at the time of writing, no anti-coronavirus drugs are available, either on the market or in pre-clinical or clinical trials. SARS-CoV may have been brought under control through effective surveillance and public health measures, but it should be noted that two human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, have been isolated in the wake of SARS (van der Hoek et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005) and animal reservoirs for a SARS-like coronavirus have also been identified Li, Shi et al., 2005) .
