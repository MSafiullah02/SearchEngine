Salivary lysozyme can also be protective. 108 The development of candidiasis in HIV-infected patients could be a consequence of inefficient lysozyme and lactoferrin concentrations and of decreased cooperation between innate and adaptive immune systems. 109 The vast majority of Candida isolates appear to succumb to nonspecific host immune mediators 110 but innate immunity alone is unable to stop yeast expansion in HIV-infected patients. 111 C. albicans-secreted aspartyl proteinase (SAP1-SAP8) and phospholipase B (PLB1 and PLB2) genes are expressed during both infection and carriage of Candida spp. The differential expression of these hydrolytic enzyme genes correlates the expression of specific Candida spp. virulence genes with active candidiasis and anatomical location. 112 Salivary anti-somatic, anti-SAP2, and anti-SAP6 antibodies are not efficient in limiting candidal infection 113 and although HIV-infected patients have a high mucosal response against C. albicans virulence antigens, such as somatic antigen, Sap1, and Sap6, 114 this is not totally protective.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 278, "end": 280, "text": "99", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 394, "end": 397, "text": "100", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 957, "end": 960, "text": "101", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 1361, "end": 1363, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1477, "end": 1480, "text": "104", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1550, "end": 1553, "text": "106", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 1675, "end": 1678, "text": "108", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 1886, "end": 1889, "text": "109", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 2073, "end": 2076, "text": "111", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 2414, "end": 2417, "text": "112", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "\u2022 Specific saliva protection against influenza A virus"}, {"text": "Defensins such as \u03b1-defensin (Human Neutrophil Peptides, HNPs) and \u03b2-defensin-2 (hBD-2) peptides can have antifungal and cytotoxic activities. 115 Defensins that exhibit antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties are a component of the innate immune response. \u03b2-defensins (hBD-1) are cationic antimicrobial peptides encoded by the DEFB1 gene expressed in oral epithelia that may have a major role in mediating and/or contributing to susceptibility to candidiasis. 116 Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in host resistance to infection with C. albicans at least in animal models. IL-4 is associated with resistance to oral candidiasis and suggests that NO is involved in controlling colonization of the oral mucosal surface with C. albicans. 117 Oral epithelial cells may play a role in innate resistance against candidiasis. 118 Host defenses against C. albicans include epithelial cell defenses and innate and specific immune mechanisms. Cell-mediated immunity by Th1-type CD4 1 T-cells is important for protection against mucosal infections, and PMNLs are important for protection against systemic infections. 119 When CD8(1) T-cell migration is inhibited by reduced tissue E-cadherin, there is susceptibility to infection which supports a role for CD8(1) T cells in host defense against oropharyngeal candidiasis. 120 Fungal pattern recognition receptors such as C-type lectin receptors trigger protective T-helper (Th)17 responses in the oral mucosa. The Th17/IL-17 axis is vital for immunity to fungi, especially C. albicans. The inflammatory cytokine IL-17 induces tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and interleukins IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. 121 A systemic immune response involving T-helper 1 (Th1) cells with the production of TNF\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 is seen in patients with oral candidiasis. 122 Th17 cells may act through IL-17, to confer defenses via neutrophils and antimicrobial factors. 123 Oral epithelial cells also are involved in local host defenses against C. albicans infections via IFN-\u03b3 induced IL-18. 124 Biofilms, some 15% of which may be due to dual Candida spp., contribute to the pathogenesis of oral candidiasis, 125 biofilm formation of C. albicans appearing to be modulated by salivary and dietary factors. 126 C. albicans hyphal wall protein 1 (Hwp1) mRNA is present in candidiasis regardless of symptoms, implicating hyphal and possibly pseudohyphal forms in mucosal carriage as well as disease. 127 Overall, Hwp1 and hyphal growth forms appear to be important factors in both benign and invasive interactions of C. albicans with human hosts.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 143, "end": 146, "text": "115", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 473, "end": 476, "text": "116", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 745, "end": 748, "text": "117", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 829, "end": 832, "text": "118", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 1116, "end": 1119, "text": "119", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 1321, "end": 1324, "text": "120", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1639, "end": 1642, "text": "121", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1884, "end": 1887, "text": "123", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 2007, "end": 2010, "text": "124", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 2124, "end": 2127, "text": "125", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 2220, "end": 2223, "text": "126", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 2411, "end": 2414, "text": "127", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "\u2022 Specific saliva protection against influenza A virus"}, {"text": "Transmission of infection by saliva may be prevented or minimized by avoidance of exposure, by good oral hygiene (plaque removal), and by the use of the various substances such as some mouthwashes, and probiotics that may inhibit salivary microorganisms. 128,129", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PREVENTION OF TRANSMISSION OF MICROORGANISMS BY SALIVA"}, {"text": "Bacterial pathogens have been identified in salivary samples by specific antibody reactivity, antigen detection, or via PCR, including Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Treponema pallidum, and a wide range of Streptococcus spp. More than 20 viruses have also been detected; these include a number of Herpes viruses, Hepatitis viruses, Human Immunodeficiency Viruses, Papillomavirus, Influenza virus, or Poliovirus. Nonviral and nonbacterial infectious agents including fungi and protozoa are also detectable, usually by antibodies to these infectious agents. Recognition of the components of the oral microbiota can help in the prediction of the onset, progression, and prognosis of oral and systemic diseases. Tests for these pathogens are currently under development. Omics methods, such as 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomics, and metabolomics, can play an essential role to explore microbial community and its metabolite production, without the biases of microbial culture. Saliva contains many antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal agents which modulate the oral microbial flora. Consequently, detection and shedding of infectious agents in saliva does not necessarily mean transmission by this route. Anyway, the presence of these pathogens in saliva is particularly important in immunosuppressed patients in whom infections can result fatal.
