            "text": "Newcastle disease Virus (NDV), a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, and Influenza virus, from the Orthomyxoviridae family, are two main avian pathogens that cause serious economic problems in poultry farming. NDV strains are classified into three major pathotypes: velogenic, mesogenic, and lentogenic. Avian influenza viruses (AIV) are also divided into: low pathogenic (LPAI) and highly pathogenic (HPAI) strains. Both viruses are enveloped, single stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses which give similar symptoms ranging from sub-clinical infections to severe disease, including loss in egg production, acute respiratory syndrome, and high mortality, depending on their level of pathogenicity. This similarity hinders diagnosis when based solely on clinical and post mortem examination. Most of the currently available molecular detection methods are also pathogenspecific, so that more than one RT-PCR is then required to confirm or exclude the presence of both pathogens. To overcome this disadvantage, we have applied a One Step Duplex RT-PCR method to distinguish between those two pathogens. The main objective of the project was to develop a universal, fast, and inexpensive method which could be used in any veterinary laboratory. \u00a9 Versita Sp. z o.o.",

The virus contains linear, segmented, single-stranded RNA of negative polarity, covered by nucleoprotein. Eight segments encode twelve proteins. On the surface of the virion, there are ion channels and two main glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, which are responsible for the diversity of this virus. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain cause severe symptoms in the respiratory tract, as well as in the digestive and nervous systems which lead to a high mortality rate of up to 100%. This group includes, in particular, some H5 and H7 influenza strains. Other strains cause milder symptoms: apathy, decrease in laying capacity, and mild respiratory tract disorders, and are known as LPAI (low pathogenic avian influenza) [1, 2] . The differences in virulence level have a molecular basis, namely changes in the cleavage site of HA0. In HPAI strains, in the cleavage site, there is a region rich with basic amino acids. This motif can be cleaved by the majority of enzymes present in various cells of the host organism [3] .",

The genome of NDV is linear, non-segmented, single-stranded RNA encoding 8 proteins [4] . NDV strains are classified into one of the three major pathotypes: velogenic, mesogenic, and lentogenic [5] , according to pathogenicity in vivo. Similarly to influenza virus, NDV pathogenicity has a molecular background. The product of F gene of highly pathogenic strains (velogenic) is recognized by a common, subtilisin-like protease, while the products of genes of low pathogenic strains (mesogenic, lentogenic) are recognized only by trypsin-like proteases present mainly in the respiratory tract [6, 7] .",

The most frequent clinical symptoms are apathy, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, secretion from nostrils and beak, breathing difficulties, strong convulsions, neck torsion, drooping wings, paralysis. In internal organs, hemorrhagic lesions occur. Also, a significant decrease in laying capacity, and laying eggs without shells, can be observed [1, 8, 9] .",

It is based on the analysis of conserved fragments of genes coding M proteins of both viruses. Both genes in both viruses show the highest level of conservation, and thus can serve as a universal tool for diagnostics and differentiation od NDVs and AIVs. Owing to the substantial difference in product lengths, the risk of a false assessment of the sample is minimized. At the same time, it allows detection of both viruses in co-infection. In previously described tests for differentiation of these two viruses, the authors selected hemagglutinin gene for influenza virus and fusion protein gene for NDV. Other test are more universal but need a two-step procedure. However, these genes are very variable, and the tests based on their detection may fail in some cases. Moreover, those tests focus on the detection of particular subtypes of AIV (H3, H5, H7, and/or H9). Though they are very useful, they do not allow detection of other subtypes of influenza virus that pose a danger to wild and domestic birds [11, 13, 16, 18, 20, 21] .",
