Owing to the segmented nature and replication dynamics of its RNA genome, influenza A virus can undergo gene reassortment and/or accumulate mutations that permit its persistence and evolution in nature as well as its adaptation to new hosts3. For example, influenza A virus circulates in birds as a pathogen of the digestive and respiratory tracts but, on occasion, gains the capacity to jump species and establish respiratory infections in mammals3. Although many strains of influenza A virus circulate in migratory bird species at any particular time, the H5N1 strain has caused several hundred human deaths since 1997, and public health authorities are concerned that it may evolve to become as deadly as the 1918 H1N1 (ref. 4). The recent emergence of H7N9 infections in humans in China is causing similar concerns5.",

            "text": "Although H5N1 is already capable of causing significant morbidity and mortality in humans, transmission thus far has been largely restricted to birds6,7. Humans infected with H5N1 seem to acquire the virus from direct contact with birds. Human-to-human, ferret-to-ferret and pig-to-pig transmission of H7N9 viruses also appears to be inefficient5,8. However, as mutations may confer human transmissibility of H5N1 and H7N9 strains, defining the determinants of avian influenza virus transmission and using this information to monitor circulating avian strains regularly for transmission potential may improve global preparedness in the face of a novel pandemic. Recent findings suggest that three amino acid substitutions are sufficient to enable airborne transmission of some H5N1 strains between ferrets1,2,9; however, it should be noted that when introduced into currently circulating strains, these particular mutations are not sufficient to switch hemagglutinin binding preference from avian to human receptors10. In addition, natural recombinations between the seasonal H1N1 and avian H5N1 can confer transmissibility in guinea pigs11. These findings raised serious public concern about whether the scientific community should be generating mammalian transmissible influenza A viruses, even within the controlled setting of enhanced biosafety level 3 containment12. Here we present an approach to mitigate safety concerns associated with avian influenza A virus gain-of-function studies. Building on previous work showing that microRNA (miRNA)-binding sites engineered into the influenza A virus genome can suppress influenza A virus gene expression and infection13,14,15, we exploited endogenous miRNAs to limit viral tropism. Specifically, we exploit species-specific differences in miRNA expression to engineer a virus that is transmissible among animals of a desired experimental species but not among humans.",

Small RNAs from human lung A549 cells, MDCK and primary ferret lung were isolated, cloned and deep sequenced. Plotting specific reads over total reads allowed us to identify miRNAs that were abundant in A549 human lung cells (defined as >1% of total) but absent or nearly absent, in both ferret lung and MDCK cells (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Potential candidate miRNAs included miR-138, miR-193b and miR-192.",

In contrast to the sequencing data, northern blot analysis revealed substantial expression of miR-193b in ferret lung; northern blot analysis supported only miR-138 and miR-192 as miRNAs with the potential to facilitate 'molecular biocontainment'. We next measured the abundance of miR-192 and miR-138 in murine lung; only miR-192 was detectable at levels sufficient to silence influenza A virus (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Furthermore, northern blot analyses of human lower respiratory tract bronchus and alveolar cell lines revealed robust miR-192 expression (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Additionally, quantitative PCR revealed that upper respiratory tract primary human nasal epithelial cells express approximately twofold more miR-192 than do alveolar cells (Supplementary Fig. 1d). These data are consistent with previous studies demonstrating miR-192 expression in primary human tracheal bronchial epithelial cells16. Given the disparate expression of miR-192 in ferret versus in human and murine respiratory tracts, we pursued miR-192 as an miRNA potentially capable of restricting influenza A virus replication in humans and mice but not in ferrets or MDCK cells.",

However, to prevent the possible reassortment of the hemagglutinin segment, here we chose to insert the miR-192 target site into segment four, which encodes hemagglutinin. To this end, we duplicated the 5\u2032 packaging sequence of segment four viral RNA, thus creating an untranslated region (UTR) at the 3\u2032 end of hemagglutinin mRNA (Fig. 2a). Without modifying the duplicated packaging sequence, we inserted scrambled noncoding RNA (control) or four fully complementary miR-192 target sites (192t) into this region (Fig. 2a). These modifications did not alter the amino acid composition of hemagglutinin or the biology of segment four, as the miRNA target sites are inserted downstream of the hemagglutinin stop codon but upstream of the duplicated packaging sequence.",

Consistent with miR-192 expression and in vitro virus growth (Fig. 2b,c), mice infected with 192t virus showed no signs of morbidity and did not succumb to the infection (Fig. 3a,b). In contrast, infection with WT or control virus resulted in weight loss and all animals died within 8 d after infection. Strikingly, even when the dose of 192t virus was increased by one order of magnitude, the mice showed no signs of morbidity or mortality. These results illustrate that species-restricted miRNA targeting of hemagglutinin can provide robust protection even when the lethal dose is exceeded by at least tenfold. In results consistent with the weight loss and survival data, we detected a reduction in pulmonary titers of 192t compared to WT or control viruses at 3 and 5 d after infection; we also noted a reduction in the amount of 192t hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein (Fig. 3c,d and Supplementary Fig. 3). To determine if the reduction in virus replication in the 192t-infected animals is a result of virus escape from miRNA targeting, either through mutation or complete excision, we plaque-purified 192t virus from the lungs of mice 5 d after infection and sequenced all isolates. All 17 of the 192t virus plaques isolated contained perfect miR-192 target sites (data not shown). These data are consistent with previous studies describing miRNA-mediated influenza A virus targeting, where no evidence of virus escape in vivo was detected; these results demonstrate the safety of this molecular biocontainment platform13,14. Taken together these data demonstrate that species-specific miRNAs expressed in the lung are capable of blunting in vivo influenza A virus infections and preventing virus-induced disease.",

For WT, control and 192t H3N2 infections, infection was spread by direct and respiratory contact with ferrets inoculated intranasally (Fig. 4a\u2013c). Consistent with the absence of miR-192 expression in ferret lungs, incorporation of miR-192 target sites did not prevent transmission in these animals. To ensure genetic stability of the recombinant hemagglutinin segment in ferrets, we isolated and sequenced virus from ferrets at day seven (Supplementary Figs. 1\u20134 and Supplementary Table 1) after aerosol transmission; we detected no evidence of excision events (data not shown).

Adding this proposed molecular biocontainment measure to existing physical safety precautions, such as the use of enhanced biosafety level 3 facilities and protocols, would greatly reduce the possibility of viral escape. One potential concern regarding this approach is the possibility of escape mutants. However, the absence of escape mutants in this study and in studies of comparable miRNA-targeting strategies suggest that escape is unlikely13,14. No alleviation of miRNA-mediated silencing was observed in viruses engineered to express more than one miRNA target site, even in viruses with polymerases of lower fidelity22. In events where escape does occur, the entire targeted sequence is excised23,24; we did not detect such an event in either of our in vivo systems. In any case, additional measures could be employed to further enhance safety including the targeting of multiple segments with either the same or unique species-specific miRNAs. Compounded targeting would not only minimize the possibility of escape but also further blunt replication in desired cells and hosts.",

Where indicated mice were infected with 1,000 p.f.u. of 192t H5 HAlo virus. Lungs were harvested at 3 and 5 d after infection and homogenized in PBS either for direct titering or protein analysis.",

            "text": "Animal studies were done as described previously with minor modifications1. Briefly, transmission studies were performed in a BSL2+ facility at the Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Maryland. Animal studies described were carried out according to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Maryland (protocol RO-09-93). For these studies ferrets were not randomized and investigators were not blinded. Prior to inoculation, 23-week-old female ferrets (Sayre, PA) were housed in holding BSL2+ for 1.5 weeks to establish a baseline for temperature, weight and general health. Serum from each ferret was assayed by nucleoprotein-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to rule out prior influenza A virus exposure. Transponders were implanted subcutaneously to provide a means of identification and temperature determination. Ferrets were inoculated with 105 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50), the amount of virus required to infect 50% of infected cell cultures, diluted in PBS (0.5 ml total volume, 0.25 ml/nostril was administered intranasally). Directly infected ferrets were inoculated 1 d before the introduction of the naive direct contact (housed within the same cage) and respiratory contact ferrets (separated by wire mesh allowing for only aerosol transmission). Ferrets were given nasal washes (0.25 ml PBS/nostril) every day after the administration of anesthesia and assayed by FluDetect (Synbiotics Corp.). Nasal washes continued until animals tested negative for two consecutive days. To prevent cross contamination, ferrets were handled in the following order: respiratory contact, direct contact, direct infected. Gloves were changed between every virus group. Once RC ferrets tested positive, they became the last to be given nasal washes. All viruses, including nasal wash samples and virus stocks, were titrated in MDCK cells by TCID50. Titers were read by hemagglutination assay using 0.5% Turkey red blood cells 3 d after infection.",
