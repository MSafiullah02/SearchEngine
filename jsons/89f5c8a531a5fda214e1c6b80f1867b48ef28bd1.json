It has already affected more than 300,000 people, with the number of deaths nearing 13000 across the world. As it has been posing a huge threat to global public health, it is of utmost importance to identify the rate at which the disease is spreading. In this study, we propose a time series model to analyze the trend pattern of the incidence of COVID-19 outbreak. We also incorporate information on total or partial lockdown, wherever available, into the model. The model is concise in structure, and using appropriate diagnostic measures, we showed that a time-dependent quadratic trend successfully captures the incidence pattern of the disease. We also estimate the basic reproduction number across different countries, and find that it is consistent except for the United States of America. The above statistical analysis is able to shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak, and gives insight on what epidemiological stage a region is in. This has the potential to help in prompting policies to address COVID-19 pandemic in different countries.",

Human to human transmission of 2019-nCoV occurs through large droplets and contact and less so by means of fomites and aerosols. It has also been seen to survive for days on surfaces like cardboard, steel and plastic. described the early transmission dynamics of the disease among initially affected Chinese population. Their preliminary estimate of the incubation period distribution indicates a 14-day medical observation period or quarantine for exposed persons.

Li and De Clercq (2020) explored therapeutic options with repurposing of older approved (favipiravir and ribavirin) or experimental antivirals (remdesivir and galidesivir) in view of highly conserved genetic sequence of the cat6alytic sites of the four 2019-nCoV enzymes which have high sequence similarity with those of SARS and MERS Coronaviruses.

Zhu et al. (2020) very recently published a systematic review of all ongoing clinical drug trials relating to this. Among many drugs studied so far, hydroxychloroquine, though pending FDA approval, appears promising and its use is supported by multiple studies like and Cortegiani et al. (2020) .

We develop a novel mathematical model to study the trend pattern of the incidence, defined by the number of new cases identified everyday, for different provinces in China and for six different countries. The implication of our work is three-fold. First, it provides insight on the rate of growth of the number of affected people. In particular, we discovered that a quadratic trend was able to explain the data best. Second, we estimate the time when there is a significant change in the growth pattern of the disease. For China, both on country-level and on province-level, it was found that the growth ceased towards the end of February. In contrast, the other countries are seeing a surge in the growth rate from around the same time. The results from this analysis can help one identify possible factors which directly or indirectly dictate the change in the growth pattern of COVID-19 incidence, for better (enabling similar strategy initiation in different population or early in the same population), or for the worse (which might indicate challenges that are to be prioritised). Finally, we estimate the basic reproduction number for different countries using the fitted values of our model. It was found that the estimates are consistent with the range provided by WHO.",

This means that those areas would only keep one entrance and exit point open, and each household is allowed limited numbers of entrances and exits per day. In addition, night-time access was prohibited in some areas as well. Our method is able to quantify the effect of lockdowns (full or partial) in respective provinces, once we account for the general time trend.

First, a Box-Ljung test is performed on the residuals to test if any of the autocorrelation is significantly different from zero. These tests were done at 5% level of significance. Fitted vs residual plot, QQ plot of the residuals, partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plot of the residuals are also explored to confirm that the model is appropriate for the data. Next, predictive ability of the model is evaluated. For every site, we use all but last three days' data to train the model, and use the estimated coefficients to predict the log-incidence of those three days. The prediction, hereafter denoted as log \u03b8 t , is then transformed to incidence and subsequently the number of new cases for that day is computed. Root mean squared error (RMSE), as defined by eq. (3.4), is finally calculated to understand how well the model can forecast the future.",

As mentioned in Section 3, AIC is used to identify the date when the trend pattern of the log-incidence changes. Most suitable AR and MA orders were also chosen accordingly. In Table 1 , we present the most appropriate ARMA order, effect of lockdowns (partial or full) wherever appropriate, p-value from the Box-Ljung test on residuals and RMSE (on the number of new-cases) for three-day-prediction for the best models corresponding to different Chinese provinces. The results show that differencing was necessary for all provinces, thereby suggesting that all of the time series were nonstationary. For Qinghai, which has observed one of the lowest prevalence rates, the most appropriate ARMA order was found to be (6, 1, 0). This describes a significant dependence with up to lag 6, that is the previous 6 days. All other provinces showed dependence with at most prior 3 days. The last two columns of Table 1 report diagnostics results. The p-value of the Box-Ljung test on the residuals was more than 0.05 for all provinces. It establishes that the residuals are not autocorrelated, thereby showing the adequacy of the model to capture the time dependence pattern appropriately. On the other hand, RMSE of the predictions of new cases in a three-day-ahead time window was at most 7.35.

While they have continued to be three of the top ten countries with highest number of confirmed cases, they showed different patterns when it comes to fatality rates. Italy and Iran have 9.01% and 7.55% fatality rates respectively, both being much higher than the overall average. South Korea, on the contrary, has observed only 1.16% fatality rate. Moreover, Korea have already adopted several screening and healthcare policies, and that may have helped them with the situation. It is also worth mention that Iran has a recovery rate which is on a higher side (37.05%).

These measures need precise depiction of the ongoing disease and realistic growth predictions for proactive measures and continuous re-assessment of implemented regulations. This study endeavoured to sketch this very scenario using a statistical model taking in account the most recent data. Using appropriate diagnostics, we confirmed that the model is able to capture the time-dependence pattern and the time trend of the disease-incidence. Combining all of the above analysis, it can be inferred that by the beginning of March, all provinces in China managed to contain the virus and consequently, the growth in the number of confirmed cases has been minimal afterwards. On the global scenario, all other countries are in a bad state. The growth rates of the incidence for these countries are increasing at the moment.
