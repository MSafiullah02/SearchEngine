The early activation marker CD69 was also examined but was not notably elevated at any time point on either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in infected mice compared with control mice (Supplementary Figure S2). Of note, elevated levels of perforin, a marker of cytotoxic functional activity, were observed in the CD8+ T cells of the mice that had to be euthanized after CCHFV-TR infection (Figure 2B).

Immunoreactivity was noted within rare mononuclear cells consistent with histiocytes in the splenic white pulp (consistent with dendritic cells) and in perivascular inflammatory foci within the lungs (Figure 3C). Small numbers of mesenchymal cells in connective and adipose tissues that were adherent to organs were immunoreactive, including tissues surrounding organs in which immunostaining was not observed (kidney, eye, heart; Figure 3D), which may explain viral RNA detection by PCR in organs that were negative by immunohistochemistry. Finally, rare spindle cells consistent with endothelial cells had cytoplasmic staining in the adrenal gland of 2 animals (TR-4 and TR-6 at 20 and 23 days after infection, respectively).",

In 1 animal (TR-4, at 20 days after infection), multiple astrocytic foci were present in the cerebellar cortex, with cell bodies within the Purkinje layer, consistent with Bergmann glial cells (Figure 6A and 6B). In addition, widely dispersed rare immunostaining of glial cells and neurons was also present without notable neuropathological changes. This included both single glial and neuronal cells, and clusters of neurons localized to specific nuclei, such as the habenular nucleus (Figure 5A). Confirmation of these cells as astrocytes or neurons was accomplished by double staining against CCHFV and glial fibrillary acidic protein (Figures 5B, 5C, 6C, and 6D), and by cellular morphology.",

In this article, we describe a new lethal mouse model of CCHF, in SGM3 humanized mice, characterized by neurological disease and several liver histopathological features comparable to those in human cases, including vacuolar degeneration/steatosis, increased single-cell necrosis, and distribution of viral antigen within Kupffer cells, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes [27, 28].",

Virus is widely disseminated in humanized mice, similar to findings in IFNAR\u2013/\u2013 and STAT-1\u2013/\u2013 mice. However, the time from exposure until euthanasia criteria are met is more prolonged than in existing immunodeficient mouse models of CCHF, and thus more consistent with the time course seen in fatal human cases (incubation of 1\u201313 days, and death generally after 5\u201314 days) [29]. Viral RNA was detected in the brains of humanized mice at 4 days after infection, increased over time, and had its highest levels in the brains of mice that succumbed to disease. In contrast, CCHFV is detected in the brains of IFNAR\u2013/\u2013 and STAT-1\u2013/\u2013 mice, but at lower levels than in other tissues (eg, liver and spleen) [9, 11]. This difference is probably due to the length of the clinical course in each model; the rapid, acute nature of disease in IFNAR\u2013/\u2013 and STAT-1\u2013/\u2013 mice (< 7 days) may prohibit high levels of viral dissemination into the brain, as seen in other models of viral infection when disease course is abbreviated rather than prolonged (eg, Nipah virus) [30].",

As described in human cases, we detected CCHFV antigen in endothelial cells of several organs, including the liver and adrenal gland. These findings, including viral tropism for endothelial cells and histopathological evidence of vascular leakage in the brain, along with previous reports of vascular compromise, support hematogenous entry of CCHFV through a compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) at the level of the brain microvessel endothelium.",

Foot processes from astrocytes form a complex network surrounding the capillaries, and this close cell association is important in induction and maintenance of the barrier properties [32]. Glial cells form a structural framework to support neuronal cells and play a role in preventing pathogen entry into the brain. Morphological and functional BBB characteristics depend on the CNS environment and on the contribution of perivascular astrocytes [33, 34]. Furthermore, an astrocyte-mediated bystander effect has been described with other encephalitic viruses, in which infected astrocytes in an endothelial cell coculture model increased permeability of the endothelium, causing endothelial cell apoptosis, morphologically altered astrocytes, and gap junction\u2013dependent disruptions in signaling between uninfected and infected cells [35]. Altogether, infection of glial cells and astrocytes provides a mechanism of disease consistent with reports of increased permeability in brain membranes of patients [2, 5].",

            "text": "The neurological involvement described in CCHF case reports may be primarily due to cytokine-mediated endothelial barrier dysfunction, or may be a direct effect of the virus in the brain [6]. Astrocytes may also play a role in disrupting CNS barriers in response to T-cell activation. CD8+ T-cell activation of astrocytes is a well-described mechanism of BBB disruption [36, 37]. We were able to detect only rare human CD8+ T cells in the brains of these mice by immunohistochemistry; however, it is unclear whether their presence, although in low numbers, directly contributes to alterations in CNS barriers or is secondary to disruption permitting cellular infiltration. Determining the role of these cells and characterizing CCHFV-mediated immune stimulation in the brain warrant future investigations.",

Infection of these regions is described in other neurotropic viral infections, including neurotropic influenza and a neurotropic murine coronavirus [39, 40]. Of particular interest is the hypothalamus because CCHFV has been isolated from the patient\u2019s hypothalamus in a fatal case [3]. In SGM3 humanized mice, we observed abundant CCHFV immunostaining of the hypothalamic meninges, and astrocytes in the presence of meningitis and reactive astrocytosis. The infection of these regions, seen in both human patients and humanized mice, suggests that future investigations should evaluate acute and long-term physiologic regulatory function and behavioral abnormalities in CCHF.",
