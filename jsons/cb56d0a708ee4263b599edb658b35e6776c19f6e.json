Among the 101 deaths, male is significantly higher than female, and the proportion of elderly patients with basic diseases is relatively high. The average age of death patients in this study was significantly higher than previous studies. In the study, we found the blood group composition of death patients (A-42.57%, B-30.69%, O-17.82%, AB-8.91%) was different from that of Han population in Wuhan [12] . Type O was relatively low, and Type A was relatively high. The mechanism which caused this is still unclear. ABO blood group antigen substances are widely distributed in the human respiratory system, digestive tract system, and reproductive system [13] . Previous research has shown that ABO blood group are related to the onset and spread of various diseases because the blood group antigens may participate in virus infection as receptor [14] [15] . In the study of various susceptible genes in SARS-CoV, individuals in the blood group O have a lower infection rate [16] . Guillon et al. found that A antibody can provide protection by inhibiting interaction between the virus and ACE2 receptor [17] . However, the higher proportion of patients with type A blood is temporarily unclear and the reason may be the lack of antibody A protection. Further research is need to explore the specific mechanism.",
