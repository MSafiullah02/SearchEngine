Economic restructuring and decline (Andriotis, 2002), globalization (Amin & Thrift, 1995), privatization (Osborne & Gaebler, 1992), internationalization and world cities' competition (Ng & Hills, 2003; Shen, 2004), and democratization (Healey, 2003) have led many governments to realize that they are losing their capacity to steer public policymaking in some areas alone. Instead, they need to collaborate with a much wider network of agencies for building strengths and accessing and utilizing resources (G\u00f6ymen, 2000; Healey, 2003). A new method or mode by which society is governed from government to governance therefore is necessary (Rhodes, 1996).",

Sustainable tourism development advocates a more balanced concern for economic, social and environment interests in tourism policy decision-making. As the concerns of sustainable tourism span numerous policy domains and involve diverse actors who have varied interests and priorities, the ability to strike a balance is often determined by how policy decisions are made and who governs or how power is distributed (Hall & Jenkins, 1995). Sustainable tourism development can only be achieved by having effective governance which draws a diverse range of actors into tourism decision-making (Bramwell & Lane, 2011).",

Governance is essentially about power that governs the interplay of individuals, organizations, and agencies influencing, or trying to influence, the direction of policy (Hall & Jenkins, 1995; Reed, 1997). The power relations affect tourism decision-making in many aspects including \u201cthe nature of government involvement in tourism, the structure of agencies responsible for tourism development, management, marketing and promotion, the nature of tourism in tourism development, and the identification and representation of tourism resources and attractions\u201d (Hall, 2005, p. 100). Understanding governance sheds light on how power is distributed and, in this case, how tourism decisions are made. It provides information to governments on how well their governance systems are able to respond to the changing social, economic and political circumstances of a society (Pierre, 1999).",

Although the SARs are both governed by China, sharing similar Basic Laws and constitutions and the same culture, they have very different forms of power relations caused by different economic, social and political conditions. Hong Kong's economic structure is based on the financial, real estate and service sectors. Macao, however, is heavily reliant on the tourism and casino gaming industry. The focus and position of the two cities, the bargaining power of the civil society, market and government, and the government's capacity and role in policymaking therefore are varied.",

It is useful to identify, analyze and explain similarities and differences across different societies, gaining a better understanding of their structures and institutions (Creswell, 2009). Comparative studies also serve as a tool for developing classifications of social phenomena and for establishing whether shared phenomena can be explained by the same causes (Creswell, 2009). In particular, Masser (1984, p. 148) suggests that cross-national comparative planning studies act as means of improving planning practice through the interpretation and transfer of experience from one country to another; and as a way of developing planning theory by transcending national cultural boundaries. It is hoped that through a comparative study of these two cities, a better understanding of the two societies and their structures and institutions can be gained.",

People, values, place, culture and government philosophy all interact to shape the decision-making process (Hall & Jenkins, 1995). In order to manage the diverse interests, a new way to manage the tourism planning and development process therefore is needed. Governance is generally regarded as a more appropriate model of political steering whereby the values of non-governmental actors are also included in the decision-making process (Wesley & Pforr, 2010). Bertucci (2002) (cited in Wesley & Pforr, 2010) argues that a healthy governance environment is the most important factor in making tourism a successful activity for sustainable development. He highlights three cores features of governance: (1) a transparent political environment that facilities representation and participation; (2) political and regulatory coherency; and (3) partnerships between state, private interests and civil society. Governance therefore signifies \u201ca new process of governing or a changed condition of ordered rule, or the new method by which society is governed\u201d (Rhodes, 1996, pp. 652\u2013653). It includes multiple stakeholders and emphasizes democracy, collaboration, coordination, stakeholder management, decentralization, community planning, power-politics, institutional arrangements and community participation (Caffyn & Jobbins, 2003; Robson & Robson, 1996; Sheldon & Abenoja, 2001; Tosun, 2000, 2006; Williams, Penrose, & Hawkes, 1998).",

Governments do have several important roles to play in the governance process (Bramwell, 2011; Hall, 2005). They are the principal actor in the political process of tourism development (Bramwell, 2011). The governments may be in a position to offer incentives or impose requirements on actors to alter their behavior so as to promote sustainability (Bramwell, 2011). However, if the goal of sustainable development is to be achieved, a new form of governance is needed. The role of government has to change from a steering role to one that engages with and manages partnerships (Beaumont & Dredge, 2010).",

It is a useful concept to understand how the political and economy conditions of a society shape the power relationship among key actors (Jessop, 2008), especially the capacity and role of a government (Pierre, 1999). The political economy approach starts from the proposition that the state is a \u201csocial relation\u201d and is \u201csocially embedded\u201d (Jessop, 2008, pp. 1, 5). The political\u2013economic environment of a city establishes parameters and legitimacy for local political interaction and decision-making, especially the role of government in the decision-making process (Digaetano & Klemanski, 1999). Conditions created by a particular political\u2013economic environment produce opportunities for developing certain governing alignments (alliances and power structures) while imposing constraints on others. According to Jessop's strategic-relational approach to political economy, actors are reflective and are capable of taking a strategic view of the structural constraints and are able to select their specific actions within those constraints strategically. Therefore, \u201cthe strategic choices of actors and organizations in the state are likely to be affected by the structural pressures in a specific society, including the broad economic and socio-cultural change and the lobbying by actors in civil society\u201d (Bramwell, 2011, pp. 468\u2013469).",

Tourism planning concepts and approaches have changed considerably since the Second World War in response to the changing social circumstances. It began with the \u201cboosterism\u201d approach, upholding the view that tourism development was of automatic benefit to the hosts and therefore natural resources should be exploited for tourism development. The planning approach later shifted to an economic industry-oriented approach, which regarded tourism as an industry that could be used as a government tool to achieve certain goals of economic growth (Hall, 2005). In the 1970s, a rational planning approach was adopted, upholding the view that spatial planning could help to eliminate the negative impacts of tourism on the physical environment (Hall, 2005). In the 1980s, critical/emancipatory approaches prevailed in response to the increased concerns about the negative environmental and social impacts of development and the realization that public choices could not be determined by a few technocrats. Realizing that local residents were stakeholders who might benefit from tourism activity, the emphasis was on communication and dialogue with the aim of achieving more community consensus (Habermas, 1984). Finally, a sustainable approach emerged in the early 1990s which required each stakeholder to uphold the principles of sustainable development in decision-making and to work in a collaborative manner (Hall, 2005).",

Gill and Williams (2011) reported the reasons for the shift in the mode of governance of the Canadian ski resort of Whistler from a pro-growth mode to a corporatist one which shows greater concern for sustainable development; this shift included realization of the degradation of the environmental conditions of the area, hosting the Winter Olympic Games, and the increasing political necessity of collaboration with local indigenous peoples.",

Institutions in the broadest definition are social rule structures with associated standing patterns of behavior and procedures (Lavoie, 1994). In tourism planning, institutions often refer to the decision-making rules, procedures, established practices, systems and organizational arrangements (Bramwell & Lane, 2011; Tosun, 2000). It is not uncommon for scholars to use the institutional approach to understand power. For instance, Andriotis (2002) found that the lack of a holistic and integrative institutional structure and framework to coordinate planning in Crete, Greece had resulted in a fragmentary planning approach that was easily led by private or economic interests. Bramwell (2011) also reported that in Malta tourism was pro-growth driven because the working group which was responsible for conducting a study on local tourism growth limits was composed of a hotelier and two tourist board officers who were pro-growth.",

First, power is not evenly distributed within a community. Some groups and individuals in society have relatively more influence than others on the governance processes affecting tourism due to their means of access to resources (Hall & Jenkins, 1995). The power relations of a society are shaped by the political and economic structure of that society. These power relations determine the rules and regulations and are manifested in a city's institutional arrangements. In tourism, this means the planning administration, process, and practices which place constraints on some stakeholders while delegating power to others, and they determine who acquires the greatest governing power, their policy agendas, and the capability and role of government.",

Three main aspects of the two SARs' tourism planning institutional framework were studied; these include: (1) the tourism planning administration, (2) strategies, polices and guidelines, and (3) the tourism plan-making process. Data were mainly collected from the secondary sources. First, the SARs' government website was browsed to understand their administrative structure of planning. Second, the published documents on the urban planning law, regulations and policies, and government planning studies and reports were carefully reviewed. Attempts were made to understand what laws, polices and guidelines related to tourism planning exist in the two SARs, along with the content and scope of information given for development. Information on the planning law, regulations and policies could be obtained from the governments or from the governments' websites. Third, some case studies about the two cities' tourism planning as reported in newspapers and academic articles were also reviewed. These case studies provided further insights into the operation, system and practice of tourism planning in the two SARs. Although newspapers and media reports have their own limitations in terms of the data reliability, they provide some insights into the current news of the two SARs. To improve reliability, multiple sources were checked and used. Fourth, two government officials involved in public works and one academic specializing in urban planning and tourism in the two SARs were interviewed. Finally, direct observation was used, since the author has lived in Hong Kong and Macao for more than 10 years each and therefore has been able to observe the two SARs' political\u2013economic conditions and their tourism planning practices.",

In the 1980s when the British government started negotiating with the Beijing government for the future of the territory, Hong Kong people were active in fighting for democracy (Cheung, 2005). The post-1997 years saw an even more active community voice their demands and expectations to the government. Yung and Chan (2011, p. 459) observe, \u201cAfter 1997, Hong Kong people have increasingly strived for their own identity, and the need for social equity in acquiring more social spaces, and more democratic right, particularly, in city planning and development is growing.\u201d Henderson (2008) also comments that there are increasing numbers of professionals and researchers speaking up to protect the city's heritage and tourism resources (Henderson, 2008). Cheung explains that this was because most of the Hong Kong people did not have a chance to elect their Chief Executive. Also, a number of bold initiatives set up by the first Chief Executive, Mr. Tung (such as the 85,000 housing target which turned Hong Kong into an IT hub and an international center for Chinese medicine), were not successfully launched due mainly to the Asian Financial Crisis. Hong Kong people were also upset about the top-down and paternalistic policymaking style of Tung and felt that their voices and needs, especially the quest for a more democratic society, were not being heard (Cheung, 2005).",

Therefore, on July 1, 2003, around half a million people, mainly the middle class and professionals, participated in a demonstration. Two other mass rallies were held in July 2003 and January 2004, pressing for full democracy in Hong Kong. Hong Kong in the post-2000 period had literally become a city of protest (Chan & Lee, 2007). However, unlike the previous period, these protests were more lively, spontaneous, and creative, and thus more difficult for the government to suppress. The new mode of political mobilization relied more on media and social networks supported by information technology (Chan & Lee, 2007). In response to the increasingly politicized community, the HKSAR government has increased their transparency in policymaking since 1997. A total of 226 public consultation exercises on public policy were conducted from 1997 to 2009 (Cheung, 2011).",

Local residents believed that these developments would completely block views of the 90-m historic lighthouse on Guia Hill (Tso, 2006). This site was carefully protected by the previous colonial administration in the 1990s, which enforced a maximum development height of 20.5 m (Ponto Final, 2007). The guidelines were now being revoked and the government explained that the changes stemmed from the need \u201cto modernize the legislation, already 15 years old and completely outdated, out of touch with the gambling sector development and the increasing need for building sites\u201d (cited in Tso, 2006, p. 19).",

In the Military Club conservation project two more floors were added without destroying the quality or classic ambience of the building; while in the BNU Bank project only the facade was conserved and the overall ambience and architecture of the building were totally destroyed. The reasons why these cases have been dealt with so differently are not known to everyone. He further observed that the World Heritage locational signage for Senardo Square (a major tourist destination) required all the agencies to sign off on it, so it had often bounced around between different government agencies for many years, and this was the reason why it was not erected until years after the World Heritage Site inscription.",

It is argued that the emergence of the executive-led mode of governance is a result of the belief of the Beijing government that only by this mode of governance could the interests of real estate and finance for Hong Kong, and casino gaming for Macao, be safeguarded; as they are the major economic drivers of the two territories and lead to the continuation of the two SARs' economic and political stability.",

There is lack of any formal channel for public involvement. In Hong Kong, even though the public is permitted to participate in tourism planning through their comments on new plans during the statutory plan exhibition period and through the TPB, the power of the general public to influence tourism planning remains very limited (Cheung, 2011; Ng, 1999). First, the extent of information published for public comment is often criticized as not sufficient and too complicated for a layman to understand (Ng, 1999). Second, only exhibiting the new plan through the government gazette cannot arouse public awareness. Third, the role of the 29 non-official TPB members in making tourism plans for Hong Kong is limited. The number is small and all these members are appointed by the Chief Executive. The representation of these 29 non-official members is another issue (interview with an academic in Hong Kong). Members have expertise and backgrounds in banking (2), social welfare (2), law (4), education (1), real estate, surveying and construction (5), engineering (3), business (2), architecture and urban planning (4), historical preservation (2), geography and environmental management (2) and logistic and transport (2) (Hong Kong Town Planning Board, 2012c). Stakeholders with interests in other fields such as information technology, medical services, tourism, and the cultural industry are not included. Finally, the comments received from the public and TPB members serve only as reference for the government. The Chief Executive has the ultimate power to accept or reject their opinions.",

Also, the Land, Public Works & Transport Office (LPWTO) in Macao holds an enormous power in planning. Despite this, there is no centralized body within the LPWTO responsible for the issue, resulting in some work being duplicated. In terms of land reclamation, Macao needs to obtain the approval from the Beijing government, but this is not the case in Hong Kong. Without checks-and-balance mechanisms, the existing institutional arrangement of Macao provides more access to, and the means to determine the use of, a city's resources; it encourages clientelism and could easily be led by private economic interests (Andriotis, 2002).",

Macao's active civil community developed late when compared with Hong Kong, due to the overall lower level of education in Macao, fewer organized professional groups compared with Hong Kong, and long-term segregation and miscommunication between the Portuguese government and the locals. In Hong Kong, the mature political community led by the well-educated middle class and professionals was developed in the early 1980s. It has imposed significant challenges to the city's governance by actively demanding more transparency in policymaking. While Macao's casino gaming has contributed significantly to the local economy and employment opportunities (Wan, 2012), Hong Kong does not show great achievements after the handover of power. Instead it has to deal with a lot of social and economic problems brought on by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and the Asian Financial Crisis. Hong Kong people are becoming even more vocal in demanding that their government handle all these problems, and they would like to be informed and involved in every policy made in the territory. This is also a reason why transparency and public participation in policymaking is more emphasized in Hong Kong than in Macao.",

The study is not without its limitations, including difficulties in accessing some of the tourism planning guidelines and policies of the government, and the lack of previous studies in this area. Future research could use qualitative interviews with the key informants in the community to obtain more insights of the issues; stakeholders could include the Church (a major landowner), the gaming experts and operators, government planning officials, local residents and professional bodies and interest groups. This study highlights the issue that as the mode of governance/governance does not exist in a static form and is subject to change, in order to have a better understanding of the process of the shift in the mode of governance of tourism planning in Macao, researchers should observe and record the evolving process on a regular and continuing basis.",
