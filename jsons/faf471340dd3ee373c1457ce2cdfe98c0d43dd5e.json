            "text": "We have previously identified three balance mechanisms that young healthy adults use to maintain balance while walking. The three mechanisms are: 1) The lateral ankle mechanism, an active modulation of ankle inversion/eversion in stance; 2) The foot placement mechanism, an active shift of the swing foot placement; and 3) The push-off mechanism, an active modulation of the ankle plantarflexion angle during double stance. Here we seek to determine whether there are changes in neural control of balance when walking at different cadences and speeds. Twenty-one healthy young adults walked on a self-paced treadmill while immersed in a 3D virtual reality cave, and periodically received balance perturbations (bipolar galvanic vestibular stimulation) eliciting a perceived fall to the side. Subjects were instructed to match two cadences specified by a metronome, 110bpm (High) and 80bpm (Low), which led to faster and slower gait speeds, respectively. The results indicate that subjects altered the use of the balance mechanisms at different cadences. The lateral ankle mechanism was used more in the Low condition, while the foot placement mechanism was used more in the High condition.",

These results suggest that neural control of balance is altered when gait characteristics such as cadence change, suggesting a flexible balance response that is sensitive to the constraints of the gait cycle. We speculate that the use of the balance mechanisms may be a factor resulting in well-known characteristics of gait in populations with compromised balance control, such as slower gait speed in older adults or higher cadence in people with Parkinson's disease.",

Key factors that lead to the decrease in gait speed in older adults remains unresolved, but we speculate that the use of the control of balance plays a larger role than previously recognized. Our focus here is to assess changes in the control of balance at different gait speeds, and more specifically cadence.",

Roos and Dingwell (2013) found that neuromuscular noise is diminished when walking slower. Less noise generally results in better estimates of a physical quantity, and thus improved control. Lyapunov exponents, a common tool used for quantifying overall stability, have been shown to be reduced at lower walking speeds (Dingwell and Marin, 2006; England and Granata, 2007) . Others have pointed to neurological deficiencies associated with slower walking, without referring to stability directly. Anson et al. (2018) have shown vestibular function loss causes people to walk with longer, slower steps, and Menz et al. (2004) have shown people with peripheral neuropathy reduced walking speed and cadence. Hsiao et al. (2017) suggested that a lateral weight shift mechanism is impaired in chronic stroke, leading to reduced gait speed.",

Variability, which is often attributed to greater instability, lessens with increased velocity (Donker and Beek, 2002) . Studies have also used the mediolateral margin of stability to quantify overall stability, which increases with speed (Hof et al., 2007; Gates et al., 2013) . A larger margin of stability is viewed as safer and more stable. Recent modeling results indicate that slowed gait can be explained entirely by diminished muscle strength (Song and Geyer, 2018) . However, Fan et al. (2016) has shown older adults with slower gait can walk faster if instructed, suggesting that locomotor capacity (i.e. force-generating capabilities) are not the reason for slowed gait. This suggests a complex relationship between stability and slowed gait, as muscle strength is considered necessary but its role in the control of balance is unknown, with other factors such as multisensory integration playing an important role (Peterka, 2002; Oie et al., 2002) .",

The foot placement mechanism consists of the swing foot moving in the direction of the perceived fall, and on heel strike, shifts the net CoP in the direction of the perceived fall. In general, the foot placement mechanism refers to the modulation of step width in a particular direction (i.e. the direction of the perceived fall). Wang and Srinivasan (2014) show that 80% of the foot placement can be explained by the position and velocity of the CoM. Theoretically, the sensory input we provide to subjects alters the perceived state of the CoM, thus there should be a difference between the predicted foot placement based on the CoM behavior, and the actual foot placement. We refer to this measure as the model-corrected foot placement. The lateral ankle is another mechanism that can shift the CoP (Hof et al., 2010) . The lateral ankle mechanism refers to the generation of ankle inversion/eversion torque during the single stance phase. Activating musculature to roll the ankle while the foot is on the ground shifts the CoP under the foot in the direction of the perceived fall. The goal is to accelerate the CoM away from the direction of the perceived fall, and by shifting the CoP in the direction of the perceived fall, the CoM will accelerate away from the perceived fall. We refer to the third balance mechanism as the push-off mechanism. The pushoff mechanism refers to the modulation of ankle plantarflexion angle during double stance. In response to a visually perceived fall to the side, we observed a direction-dependent modulation of the stance leg ankle plantar/dorsiflexion angle. Very few studies have recognized the pushoff mechanism's role in control of balance in the medial-lateral direction. Ankle plantarflexion torque has been shown to change as a result of bipolar, binaural galvanic vestibular stimulation (Iles et al., 2007) . Only recently has the push-off been verified to have a functional role in balance control in the medial-lateral direction as Kim and Collins (2015) show modulation of ankle torque based on CoM behavior can reduce metabolic expenditure. Furthermore, Klemetti et al. (2014) have provided evidence that ankle plantarflexion torque induces trunk roll accelerations, providing further support for the push-off acting in the medial-lateral direction.",

Second, the difference in the use of the variables associated with a balance mechanism is judged statistically significant when the 95% confidence intervals for the Low and High condition did not overlap (highlighted grey in Table 2 ).

We limited our analysis to the time interval from the heel-strike triggering the stimulus to the end of the second double stance post-stimulus, which encompasses the three previously identified balance mechanisms of lateral ankle roll, foot placement shift and push-off modulation. We observed changes in kinematics, ground reaction forces, and muscle activation to determine whether the neural control of balance is altered at different cadences.

Neither the time, nor the magnitude of the maximal CoM displacement in the direction of the perceived fall is significantly different between the two cadence conditions. However, the relative use of the mechanisms depends on the cadence. We found that the lateral ankle mechanism played a larger role in the Low condition, supported by differences in the CoP-CoM modulation, ankle inversion, and lateral ankle inverter (tibialis anterior) electromyography readings. The ankle inverted to a larger degree in Low, indicating that the larger shift of the CoP in the Low condition is a result of the use of the lateral ankle mechanism. The increased inversion, along with the prolonged single stance period allows the CoP and CoM to separate for a longer period of time. The combination of decreased peroneous longus muscle activity and increased activity of the tibialis anterior muscle in the Low condition compared to the High condition, yields an increased inversion angle ( Figure 5C ). The tibialis anterior is not only an ankle dorsiflexor, but also an ankle inverter, so the combined electromyographical changes to the muscles responsible for ankle inverting suggests the central nervous system is actively generating a larger shift of the CoP under the stance foot in the Low condition. The increased use of the lateral ankle mechanism during the Low condition makes sense, given the increased duration of single stance in the Low condition.",

This model-corrected foot placement shift isolates the response to the sensory perturbation, which should be equal between the two cadence conditions. In previous experiments, this model-corrected foot placement shift showed a more consistent response to the sensory perturbation than the uncorrected value (Reimann et al., 2018b) .

Unexpectedly, we observed a difference in the dorsiflexion angle between ca-dence conditions early in the gait cycle, with an increased dorsiflexion in the Low condition (see Figure 8A ). Counterintuitively, the gastrocnemius EMG is also increased in the Low condition early in the gait cycle (see Figure 8B ), therefore the dorsiflexion response must be attributed to the increased tibialis anterior activity (see Figure 5C ).

As the vestibular perturbation elicits a perceived acceleration of the CoM in a particular direction, the CNS must shift the CoM an equal amount in the opposite direction to counter the perceived shift. The adjustment can be made continuously throughout the gait cycle, and the total balance response can be viewed as the summation of the balance mechanisms. These results suggest that the lateral ankle and foot placement mechanisms are interdependent while interdependence between the push-off mechanism and the other mechanisms, is weak at best.",

The foot placement mechanism is the most commonly modeled balance mechanism (Townsend, 1985; Wang and Srinivasan, 2014) , but to our knowledge no one has attempted to determine its use at varying cadences. Furthermore, models of human locomotion have difficulty walking at slower speeds (Song and Geyer, 2015) . The difficulty with gait speed adjustment may point to limitations in the mechanisms available in these models for the control of balance. The inability for the models to walk slowly could be a result of missing the degree of freedom and control strategy to implement the lateral ankle, foot placement, and push-off mechanism in a coordinated fashion. To allow for a model to maintain walking at different gait speeds, multiple balance mechanisms may be required in order to reproduce as flexible a system as observed with human bipedal gait.",

            "text": "Finally, we speculate that these findings may shed light on the development of preferred walking speeds, particularly in populations that have difficulty with balance. Older adults tend to decrease gait speed with age (Himann et al., 1988; Lauretani et al., 2003) , which according to this data set would result in more use of the lateral ankle mechanism. We also know that people with Parkinson's disease take shorter faster steps (Knutsson, 1972) , and although their overall gait speed is diminished, an increase in cadence may shift the majority of the balance response to the foot placement compared to age matched controls. Reasons for why people with Parkinson's Disease would shift the balance response to foot placement lies in evidence that they have reduced proprioception (Hwang et al., 2016) , possibly leading to an inability to sense the CoP under the stance foot. This deficit would make the use of the lateral ankle mechanism unreliable. If a particular balance mechanism is unreliable or cannot be used, the CNS must recruit the available balance mechanisms. In a hypothetical case that the lateral ankle mechanism activation is hindered, it seems logical to increase cadence to rely more on the foot placement mechanism. Thus, we speculate that balance mechanisms play a role in preferred cadence, and possibly gait speed. Future experiments will attempt to directly assess the role of cadence in balance and preferred gait speed in older adults and those with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease.",

Different walking speeds in the cadence conditions produced different vertical heel trajectory profiles which required intervention by the experimenter (see Methods). Increasing the vertical threshold created a longer period of time from threshold crossing to actual heel strike for the Low condition. Therefore, the stimulus for the Low condition was triggered on average \u223c175ms prior to heel strike, and the stimulus for the High condition was triggered \u223c110ms prior to heel strike, coincidentally corresponding to \u223c20% of the time between heel strikes for each condition.

The current findings support the idea that balance mechanisms are coordinated to produce an overall balance response. In the Low condition, the lateral ankle mechanism plays the primary role in the overall balance response, while the foot placement mechanism is not observed. When cadence is decreased (Low), single stance is longer, providing more opportunity to modulate the CoP through ankle roll, and diminishing the need for a change in foot placement to maintain upright posture. In the High condition, with shorter single stance duration, the lateral ankle mechanism is less effective and the balance response shifts to reliance on the foot placement mechanism. These findings suggest lateral stability is not dependent on cadence or gait speed, but the method of obtaining stability is altered with cadence, providing evidence of a flexible neural control scheme that adapts to changing constraints while walking. Moreover, such findings provide insight into adoption of preferred gait parameters, particularly in populations who have drastically altered gait speed or cadence such as older adults or people with Parkinson's disease.

The virtual environment consisted of a tiled marble floor with floating cubes randomly distributed in a volume 0-10 m above the floor, 2-17 m to each side from the midline, and infinitely into the distance, forming a 4 m wide corridor for the subjects to walk through (see , implemented in Unity3d (Unity Technologies, San Francisco, CA, USA).

Subjects responded to the balance perturbation by shifting their CoM in the direction opposite to the perceived fall direction, i.e. away away from the triggering leg in both conditions (Figure 3). The CoM deviation peaks in the third single stance post-stimulus for the Low condition, and peaks in the fourth single stance post-stimulus for the High condition. The total CoM excursion was similar in both conditions, with the peak CoM excursion for the Low condition116.31 mm and 123.06 mm for the High condition, on average.
