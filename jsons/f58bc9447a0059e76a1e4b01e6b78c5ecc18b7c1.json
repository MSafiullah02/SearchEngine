NETs were identified in 2004 and they are often overlooked as drivers of severe 208 pathogenic inflammation [22] . NETs have pathogen killing properties and include strands of 209 DNA wrapped with histones and are enriched with neutrophil proteins like MPO and ELANE 210 [23] . PRTN3, ELANE, and CTSG are coined as neutrophil serine proteases (NSP) and have 211 tissue degrading and microbial killing effects [24] . NSP's active role in neutrophil-associated 212 lung inflammatory and tissue-destructive diseases has been reported [25] . Increased 213 expressions of PRTN3, ELANE, and CTSG was reported in COPD patients [26] . In a mouse 214 model study ELANE or PRTN3 was introduced to the trachea which caused tissue destruction 215 and enlargement in airspace [27] . ELANA expression was also implicated in the impairment 216 of host defense resulting in a decrease in mucociliary clearance of bacteria and also pathogens 217 phagocytosis [28] . CD2, CD4, and CD8 can be cleaved on the surface of T-cells by ELANE 218 and CTSG that dysregulate T-cell Function [29] . It was reported that patients that lack alpha-1 219 antitrypsin (\u03b11-Pi) which s the physiological inhibitor of PRTN3 and ELANE carries a high 220 risk of developing emphysema [30] . Azurophil granules also carry Cathepsin D which was 221 reported to be up-regulated in the pulmonary macrophages in a mouse model of cigarette 222 smoking [31] . Severe COPD cases exhibited MPO positive cells as a signal of neutrophil 223 activation [32] . On the other hand in a mouse model of influenza it was shown that the 224 inflammation damage was reduced by the absence of MPO [33] . IL-32, a proinflammatory 225 cytokine with four isoforms, cleavage by PRTN3 propagates cytokine activity and triggers IL-226 1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and chemokines [34] . It was argued that the targeted inhibition of 227 PR3 or silencing of IL-32 by an inactive form of PRTN3 may halt the IL-32 driven immune 228 dysregulation [34] . NSPs like ELANE, CTSG, and PRTN3 can cleave pro-IL-1beta to 229 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

The replication of the virus is through the human airway 61 epithelial cells where it targets the receptors of human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 62 (ACE-2). The high mortality observed in COVID-19 is associated with severe acute 63 respiratory distress and systemic coagulopathy. Many COVID-19 patients show a postponed 64 onset of respiratory issues but then develop into more severe situations. We wanted to 65 investigate the molecular changes in the COVID-19 patients' naso-oropharyngeal swab 66 samples via comparison to the proteome of PCR negative cases. Our goal is to find pathways 67 associated with the site of infection through proteomics analysis. 17 statistically significant 68 protein alterations lead us specifically to neutrophil degranulation pathways. 69 During airway infections, Neutrophils are the first wave of defense that also defines the 70 disease outcome. Neutrophils have multiple functions in viral infections such as inactivation 71 of the virus, achieved by phagocytosis, ROS production, proteolytic enzyme release, NET 72 activation (NETosis, Neutrophil Extracellular Traps). Neutrophils also interact with immune 73 cells and secreting cytokines participate in eliciting an antiviral response. 74 Neutrophil granulocytes express several enzymes linked to controlling host infection. As the 75 cytotoxic molecules are released from the granules they have an impact on the inflammatory 76 response. Such adverse molecules cause severe damage to the host where it exhibits itself as 77 perivascular infiltrates around the capillaries in the lungs as observed in SARS-CoV-2 78 patients.

The main 141 cluster includes Neutrophil Elastase (ELANE), Azurocidin (AZU1), Myeloperoxidase 142 (MPO), Myeloblastin (PRTN3), Cathepsin G (CTSG) and Transcobalamine-1 (TCN1). The 143 abundance of these proteins were found to be increased in COVID-19 positive patient 144 samples compared to negative ones. REACTOME pathway enrichment analyses of the 145 differentially expressed proteins were performed. Nine of the proteins were primarily 146 associated with the immune system pathway.
