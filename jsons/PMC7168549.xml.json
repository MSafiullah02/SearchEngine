This viral disease together with Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) have caused a significant economic impact due to the high mortality rate in piglets (Jung, Hu, & Saif, 2016; Zhang, 2016). PDCoV belongs to the recently classified subgenus Buldecovirus of the Deltacoronavirus genus (ICTV, 2018). The subfamily Orthocoronavirinae is divided into four genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus. The first two genera originate in bats, while the third and fourth genera originate in birds (Woo et al., 2012). These viruses can affect several species of mammals and birds and cause various clinical conditions (neurological, digestive and respiratory) (Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014).",

These enveloped viruses, with a single chain in the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 direction and a helical nucleocapsid, contain at least seven open reading frames (ORF), which code for four structural proteins (Masters, 2006; Sawicki, 2009). Coronaviruses received their name due to one of their surface proteins, which is spicule\u2010shaped, giving the appearance of a crown. This so\u2010called S or \"Spike\" protein is glycosylated and plays a fundamental role in the binding and entry of the virus into the cell (Masters, 2006). The genome organization of PDCoV is in the following order: 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), replicase (ORF 1ab), spike gene (S), envelope gene (E), membrane gene (M), nonstructural gene 6 (NS6), nucleocapsid gene (N), NS7 gene and 3\u00b4UTR. Particularly, PDCoV lacks ORF 3 and non\u2010structural protein 1 (Lee & Lee, 2014; Woo et al., 2012; Zhang & Yoo, 2016).",
