            "text": "The mortality rate due to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) increased rapidly during the past decade. Unluckily, the clinically satisfactory and successful treatment for HCC patient is still absent [1]. Several risk factors are involved in hepatocarcinogenesis like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, alcoholism, obesity, aflatoxin B1, iron accumulation and diabetes [2]. There are several protocols used in the treatment of HCC, including, surgical resection, ablation, chemotherapy and embolization. The use of these methods is limited due to their side effects and the development of resistance to the available chemotherapy and their complexities. Due to the limited treatment options to HCC, other than surgery and the poor prognosis of the disease, there is a critical need for additional therapies to enhance the survival or the quality of life. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is considered as one way that may improve the anticancer drug efficacy and reduce their toxic effects [3]. The use of herbal medicines can be traced back to more than 4000 years ago in ancient China and Egypt. Over recent decades, an increasing number of herbal products, including medicinal herbs and phytochemicals, have been used for treating chronic liver diseases worldwide due to cost effectiveness, higher safety margins, long-lasting curative effects and few adverse effects. According to the previous studies, medicinal herbs and phytochemicals could protect the liver by several mechanisms such as eliminating the virus, blocking fibrogenesis, inhibiting oxidative injury and suppressing tumorigenesis [4].",

The co-treatment of LPP with ethanol administration markedly enhanced the liver injury in an alcohol-induced liver injury rat model by decreasing the oxidative stress and the accumulation of lipid in the liver [32]. In acute liver injury, LPP was found to keep the normal hepatic histology, decrease the hepatic inflammation/chemoattraction, stimulate the partial regeneration of the liver through the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB)\u2013dependent pathway, and reduce the oxidative stress when used prior CCl4 intoxication in mice [33].",

The growth and cell proliferation of HCC-derived cells are inhibited by EGCG by induction of apoptosis [40]. The human HCC cell line, HepG2, growth was also inhibited by EGCG, through suppressing the phosphorylation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and reducing the activation of its signaling molecules like extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), STAT-3, Akt and GSK-3\u03b2 [41]. Drinking of EGCG caused a significant inhibition of liver cell adenoma development in contrast to the EGCG-untreated control group. This is related to decreased phosphorylation of ERK, Akt and IGF-1R proteins, activation of the hepatic AMP-activated kinase protein and the treatment of liver steatosis. The administration of EGCG in drinking water also caused a significant reduction of serum levels of insulin, IGF-1, IGF-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and free fatty acid. It also caused a decrease in the hepatic expression of TNF-\u03b1, interleukins(IL-1\u03b2,IL-6), and IL-18 mRNAs [42]. The development of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P+) foci was also inhibited after the administration of EGCG in drinking water through the reduction of hepatic fibrosis, triglyceride content, inflammation, oxidative stress and inhibition of excessive hepatocyte proliferation [43].",

Recently, RSV has been found to be helpful in the treatment of NAFLD. When RSV is given after NAFLD induction by using high fat-diet, it causes a reduction of lipogenic genes as SREBP-1c and FAS [45]. The treatment with RSV also reduced the inflammation and oxidative stress in rats [46]. RSV causes a dysregulation in the metabolism of lipids in NAFLD through sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) pathway [47] and the up-regulation of hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor [48]. RSV increases apoptosis in HCC cells, which is associated with the reduction of hexokinase 2 expression. Additionally, RSV improved the inhibition of cell growth induced by sorafenib in aerobic glycolytic HCC cells. The inhibition of hexokinase 2 by RSV can be considered to be a new trend to treat HCC and prevent its progression [49]. RSV was also found to decrease the expression of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which inhibited liver tumorigenesis and promoted cell apoptosis in HCC rats induced by DENA. The expression of MLCK was found to be higher in HCC rats than normal rats, which is responsible for the proliferation and anti-apoptotic properties [50].",

It has a variety of pharmacological actions as antioxidant, anti\u2010inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiemetic and cytotoxic properties [72]. Different mechanisms are involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of Alpinia officinarum, including the regulation of NF\u2010\u03baB, MAPKs pathway and the inhibition of prostaglandin E2 synthase and COX-2, the important enzymes involved in the inflammation. This effect is usually due to its content of diarylheptanoids and flavonoids [73]. Two compounds of Alpinia officinarum rhizome extract, galangin and 5-hydroxy-7-(4\u2033-hydroxy-3\u2033-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenyl-3-heptanone, exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities due to their phenolic content. These compounds showed a high affinity toward COX-2 active site through a molecular docking study [74]. Our recent study also demonstrated that five compounds isolated from the Alpinia officinarum rhizome extract showed a powerful anti-inflammatory effect on HepG2 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide. These compounds are galangin, isorhamnetin, two diarylheptanoids and kaempferide. These compounds down-regulated the gene expression of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, pro-inflammatory cytokines and TNF-\u03b1 in a dose-dependent manner. This indicates that these isolated compounds may be a promising treatment for other inflammatory diseases [75].",

Vitamin C activity is related to its free electron that interacts with electron deficient ions. Several in vitro studies reported the antioxidant activity of vitamin C [92]. In vivo studies also showed the antioxidant properties of vitamin C in a dose-dependent manner. Vitamin C administration protects guinea pigs, that do not form vitamin C, and osteodystrophy syndrome rats from oxidative stress when given oxidizing agents as endotoxin [93] and carbon tetrachloride [94]. It also protects rats exposed to cigarette smoke [95]. Parquet is highly toxic nitrogen herbicide and has strong oxidizing stress. The administration of vitamin C reduces oxidative stress before (not after) parquet administration [96]. Vitamin C has a promising role in cancer treatment through its selective cytotoxic activity for diverse cancer cell lines [97,98]. In 1970s, a clinical study was performed and proved that ascorbate has an important role in increasing the survival of cancer patients at late stages [99]. Combination of methotrexate with vitamin C is promising in cancer treatment through the reduction of H2O2 produced from methotrexate in Hep3B cells [100]. It was shown that vitamin C helped in the treatment of hepatotoxicity induced by DENA in Smp30 KO mice [101].",

Ginger not only used as a condiment but also it has antiemetic and anticancer activity [106]. Ginger has strong antioxidant and cell protection activity. This action of ginger is due to its potent active constituents as sesquiterpenoids, tannin, gingerols, shogaols and anthocyanin. Several in vitro and in vivo studies documented the antioxidant activity of ginger. The protective effect of ginger was showed against several toxic agents, like bromobenzene and cisplatin [107]. Another study displayed the chemopreventive effect of ginger against cancer [108]. Ginger has a great activity in the treatment of experimental cancer in a rat model. It decreased the level of growth factors and \u03b1-fetoprotein (liver tumor marker) after giving rats a daily dose about 50 mg/kg of ginger extract [109]. The anticancer effect of ginger is due to it's proapoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties. The anti-inflammatory activity of ginger was confirmed by inhibiting NF-\u03baB and TNF-\u03b1 after administration of 100 mg/kg of ginger in HCC rat model [110]. Ginger contains other different constituents as clavatol, pinostrobin, and geraniol. These active components were detected by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Ginger was found to inhibit the proliferation of cells in HepG-2 cell line (IC50, 900 \u03bcg/ml) [111]. One of the most popular active components in ginger is 6-shogaol which showed an anticancer effect against hepatoma cell line through the activation of ROS-mediated caspase-dependent apoptosis in a multidrug resistance [112].",

The most active antioxidant components in this plant are vitamins, flavonoids and carotenoids. Isothiocyanates, the hydrolytic product of glucosinolate, is considered one of the antioxidant components, which motivates DNA protection from damage through its antioxidant activity [113,114]. The antioxidant property of broccoli may be direct by contributing in biochemical, cellular and physiological steps that inhibit free radical production, or indirect by inducing phase II enzymes that have a protective effect against OS [115]. The antioxidant activity of broccoli was observed in the human colon mucosa that exposed to oxidative stress [115]. Broccoli showed a potential anticancer activity due to its high content of glucosinolates [116]. Broccoli also contains a distinct component, sulforaphane, which is characterized by its activity as antioxidant and its ability to protect DNA from breaking down by highly reactive electrophiles through increasing the antioxidant system activity and inhibition of inflammation [117]. Antioxidant activity of sulforaphane is related to certain pathways, including the reduction of inflammation through inhibiting NF-\u03baB and overexpression of transcription of Nrf2, which has a very important role in keeping healthy cells and protect them from toxic chemicals and lifestyle-related factors [118]. Previous in vivo studies registered that sulforaphane has abroad activity against different types of liver diseases related to toxic chemicals [119,120], consumption of alcohol [121] and using high calorie food [122]. Broccoli has a major role in the suppression of different types of cancers, including liver HEP-G2 and colon cancer. Sulforaphane has different pathways related to its anticancer effect as it has anti-inflammatory, proapoptotic and cell cycle arresting action [123].",

It is used in Japan, India, Korea, China and other Asian countries for a long time in the treatment of several diseases like inflammations, viral and bacterial infections and high blood pressure [139]. The most abundant di-terpene lactone found in the leaves and stems of A. paniculata is andrographolide. The andrographolide treatment was found to reduce the replication of HCV markedly and have a synergistic effect with the clinical trial drug PSI-7977 or current antiviral drugs like telaprevir and IFN-\u03b1 when used in combination to treat HCV. The mechanism of action of andrographolide may be due to its ability to induce the p38 MAPK/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, where, MAPK stands for mitogen activated protein kinase and HO-1 is heme oxygenase-1. It was shown that andrographolide can be used as natural product or potential drug that is helpful in the treatment of HCV [140]. The treatment with A. paniculata aqueous extract was found to enhance the activity of hepatic enzymes and normalizes histopathological changes of malignant hepatic tissue induced by hexachlorocyclohexane [141]. It showed indirect and direct effects on tumor cells by inducing apoptosis and cancer cell necrosis, improving body's own immune system against tumor cells and inhibiting cell-cycle arrests and cancer cells proliferation [142]. The ethanolic extract of A. paniculata showed a cytotoxic effect against diverse human cancer cell lines like PC-3 (prostate), HepG2 (hepatoma), colon 205 (colonic) cancer cells and Jurkat (lymphocytic) [143]. The inhibitory effect of andrographolide and its analogs on tumor cells may be due to their ability to depress cyclin-dependent kinase and induce the expression of inhibitory proteins of the cell cycle that result in blocking the cell cycle progression at G0/G1 [144]. Andrographolide causes induction of apoptosis by several mechanisms including, the activation of caspase cascade, the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria and the activation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax conformational change [145]. It also causes activation of ROS-dependent c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) resulting in the activation of tumor suppressor p53 and thereby increasing p53 phosphorylation and protein stabilization [146].",

In a dose-dependent manner, silymarin inhibits the population growth of the human hepatocellular cancer cells (HepG2) as it elevates the percentage of apoptotic cells [154]. The antiproliferative activity of silymarin was also reported by another study without affecting the nontumor hepatic cells. In the G0/G1 phase, silymarin caused an increase in the percentage of cells, while in the S-phase it decreased the cell percentage associated with down-regulation of cyclin E, cyclin D1, phospho-Rb and CDK4 and up-regulation of p53, retinoblastoma protein (Rb), p27Kip1, and p21Cip1 [155]. Silymarin also showed in vivo preventive and therapeutic efficiency against liver cancer. Ramakrishnan et al. [156] reported that silymarin has a protective effect against DENA-induced HCC in rats. Silymarin also showed a potent preventive effect against spontaneous HCC in HBV X protein transgenic mouse model. Oral silymarin in a dose-responsive manner causes a restoration of the early stage hepatic damage and fatty changes that lead to the recovery of hepatic tissue [157]. The oral administration of silibinin showed a significant reduction of HCC xenograft growth by inducing histone acetylation, apoptosis and expression of SOD1 and inhibiting cell cycle progression, cell proliferation (Ki-67 expression), ERK and PTEN/P-Akt signaling [158].",

N. sativa and its main constituent thymoquinone (TQ) possess numerous therapeutic and pharmacological activities like anti-inflammatory [175], anticancer [176], antioxidant [177] and immunomodulatory activities [178]. It has cytotoxic activity, as the ethyl acetate column chromatographic fraction of the ethanolic extract of N. sativa showed a cytotoxic effect against diverse cell lines such as Molt4, Hep G2 and LL/2 [179]. Another in vitro studies showed about 50% cytotoxicity of a crude methanolic extract of N. sativa against Dalton's lymphoma ascites (DLA), Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) and Sarcoma-180 cells (S-180 cells) [180]. Its anti-cancer activity is due to its ability to exhibit powerful pro-apoptotic, anti-proliferative, anti-mutagenic, anti-metastatic and anti-oxidant effects. It also can inhibit tumor initiation and progression and has an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effect. N. sativa can regulate signaling pathways like p53, iNOS and caspases [181]. The anti-tumor activity of N. sativa was reported in several in vivo and in vitro studies. A decoction that consists of seeds of N. sativa, Smilax glabra rhizome, and Hemidesmus indicus roots showed a significant improvement in the hepatocarcinogenesis induced by DENA(4\u20136 g/kg/day) in rats [182]. The ethanolic extract of N. sativa showed a marked enhancement of DENA-induced histopathological variations of the hepatic tissue [183]. Another in vivo study showed that the administration of a methanolic extract of N. sativa in HCC albino rat model showed modulation of glucoregulatory enzymes [184]. Aqueous extract of N. sativa showed in vitro antiproliferative activity and morphological changes like membrane damage and cell shrinkage in HepG2 cells, which lead to DNA damage, cell death and a decrease in cell proliferation [185]. The mechanisms that explain the pharmacological effects of Nigella sativa can be summarized in Fig. 4\n[186].",

            "text": "Sex has a vital role in HCC development as males are more diagnosed for HCC than females, with a ratio of 2:1\u20134:1. This may be due to the higher susceptibility of males to be infected with viral hepatitis, smoking, consuming higher amounts of alcohol and have a higher body mass index than females. The higher level of testosterone is associated with advanced hepatic fibrosis in males infected with HCV and HCC in hepatitis B carriers [195,196]. Another potent hepatocarcinogen is aflatoxin, which produced by Aspergillus species found on corn, grains, soybeans or peanuts that stored in warm humid conditions [197]. Several genetic and metabolic diseases are associated with HCC development such as Wilson\u2019s disease, hemochromatosis, \u03b1-1 antitrypsin disease, glycogen-storage disease types I and II, porphyrias and tyrosinemia [198]. Other factors are also reported to be associated with the marked elevation of HCC development such as cigarette smoking and prolonged use of contraceptive pills [199]. Diabetes mellitus is now considered as an independent risk factor for HCC [200,201]. It causes liver cell damage through hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance [202]. Hyperinsulinemia induces HCC through inflammation, cellular proliferation and apoptosis inhibition. As well, the increase in insulin levels can lead to a decline in the synthesis of insulin growth factor binding protein 1 by the liver, which is supposed to cause an increase in the bioavailability of insulin-like growth factor 1, in addition to the increase in apoptosis inhibition and cellular proliferation [203]. Insulin has also been related to increased oxidative stress and the ROS production, participating in DNA mutation [204].",

The development of HCC passes through several intermediate steps such as molecular and transcriptional events that end finally to malignant transformation of hepatocytes. Several factors are involved in these steps including; NAFLD, HCV, HBV, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, some inborn metabolic errors, environmental toxins and some drugs, etc. Accumulating evidence suggested that many dietary and natural products could be potential sources for prevention and treatment of liver cancer. These natural products (summarized in Table 1) and their active ingredients can inhibit the liver cancer development and progression, through cutting the roads in front of the known leading risk factors for HCC. We here call Urge the Ministry of Health in each country to establish records of liver patients, especially liver tumors. We recommend the use of these plants side by side to recent chemical medications and after stopping these chemicals, as a maintenance therapy to avoid HCC progression and decrease its global incidence. We also draw attention of specialists in the food industry to add some of these natural products in different recipes to reduce the probabilities of liver diseases infections.",
