It is not known to occur spontaneously in other vertebrates and does not directly affect other organs apart from the nervous system. Motor dysfunction (hypokinesia, postural imbalance, cogwheel rigidity, resting tremor) indicates the presence of disease, but also can appear in the guise of \u2018Parkinsonism\u2019 in other disorders that are associated with a significant reduction of dopamine in the central nervous system (CNS). Parkinsonism may develop as a sequel to intoxication, trauma, vascular disease and infections. There are genetically based familial forms and degenerative or sporadic forms, the last of which include the tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and synucleinopathies such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Lewy body disease. Lewy body disease has been further subdivided into pure autonomic failure, sporadic PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. This review will refer mainly to the sporadic form of PD.",

Of the diverse neuronal types within the human nervous system, only a few develop pathological inclusions, and this selective involvement is reflected in the regional pattern of the pathology. Vulnerable cells are distributed throughout the peripheral, enteric and central portions of the nervous system (ENS/CNS) [9, 10, 11, 12]. All of the susceptible cells are projection neurones that generate a long and thin axon, which is unmyelinated, or poorly myelinated [13]. Despite their greater prevalence with advancing age, PD\u2010associated inclusion bodies do not occur consistently in all aged non\u2010symptomatic cases and, as such, they are pathological rather than protective or neutral age changes. The presence of these pathognomonic inclusions is a prerequisite for the post mortem diagnosis of sporadic PD [14, 15].",

This theory was derived from sources based on psychology, physiology, anatomy and pathology. Additional studies not only have corroborated the initial involvement of anterior olfactory structures, but also have pointed to an early involvement of the enteric nerve cell plexuses as well as of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the intermediate reticular zone in the lower brainstem [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. To be plausible, any theory attempting to explain sporadic PD must incorporate these extra\u2010nigral sites, which consistently become affected in the course of the disorder [9]. Furthermore, any speculation regarding the cause and beginnings of PD must take into account the involvement of olfactory and autonomic systems that generally develop prior to the onset of the classical somatomotor symptoms [26, 27, 28]. This article will review the evidence for such involvement and summarize several hypotheses developed on the basis of these findings.",

A subsequent larger study used detection threshold tests to amyl acetate in 78 subjects and 40 controls [30]. Thresholds were reduced, but no correlation was found with age, gender or treatment with levodopa. Unlike the first study, there was no association with disease duration. The next sizeable investigations using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) showed that age\u2010matched olfactory dysfunction did not relate to odour type, was independent of disease duration, and did not correspond with motor function, tremor or cognition [31, 32]. The authors also demonstrated that the deficit was of the same magnitude in both nostrils, and not influenced by anti\u2010Parkinsonian medication. A comparable survey was undertaken using UPSIT in 155 cognitively normal, depression\u2010free PD patients, and 156 age\u2010matched controls [33]. UPSIT scores for PD patients were dramatically lower than those for controls. There was no correlation between disease duration and UPSIT score (r = 0.07). Impairment of smell sense has also been documented in PD patients using Sniffin Sticks [34, 35]. Although the psychophysical evidence provides overwhelming support for olfactory involvement in PD, it does not completely eliminate the possibility of confounding factors from cognitive dysfunction, nor can it be determined whether the smell defect is initially peripheral or central [36, 37, 38, 39].",

In 36 patients (49%), responses were either absent or unsatisfactory for technical reasons. Analysis of the 37 with a measurable trace showed that, for hydrogen sulphide (H2S), a highly significant latency difference existed between diagnostic groups. Similar results were obtained in 31 patients with clinically labelled PD tested by OERP to vanillin and H2S [41].

Montgomery and colleagues [43, 44] implemented a test battery comprising motor function, olfaction (UPSIT) and mood for PD first\u2010degree relatives. There were significant differences in sons and daughters, particularly where the affected parent was the father. This work has been criticized [45] because there may have been self\u2010selection in allegedly unaffected relatives \u2013 who may have had undisclosed motor complaints resulting in the unusually high 2\u2010year positive prediction rate (40 out of 59 subjects). Ponsen et al. [45] evaluated prospectively 78 asymptomatic first\u2010degree relatives of non\u2010familial PD patients by olfactory tests and Dopamine Transporter Scan (DATScan). Forty were hyposmic at baseline and, when reviewed 2 years later, four had abnormal DATScans and showed clinical signs of PD. In the remaining 36 hyposmics, who displayed no sign of PD, the rate of decline of dopamine transporter binding was higher than in normosmic relatives. Others [46] tested 30 patients with unexplained and isolated smell impairment to determine whether any might be in the premotor phase of PD. Apart from detailed olfactory testing, subjects were evaluated by DATScan and transcranial sonography of the substantia nigra. Eleven displayed increased (that is, abnormal) echogenicity on transcranial sonography characteristic of PD. Ten subjects volunteered for DATScan and, of them, five had abnormal scans and an additional two were borderline, suggesting that they might be in a presymptomatic phase of PD. Two of the five scan\u2010positive patients have now developed clinically confirmed PD (Hummel, pers. comm., 2006).",

The authors used the cross\u2010cultural Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT) [48] in 263 healthy Japanese\u2010American men aged 71\u201395 years who participated in the Honolulu\u2010Asia Ageing Study. After 7\u2010year follow\u2010up, 19 men developed PD at an average latency of 2.7 years from baseline assessment. Adjustment for multiple confounders gave relative odds for PD in the lowest tertile of BSIT score of 4.3 (95% CI 1.1\u201316.1; P = 0.02), thus indicating a moderate predictive power of olfactory testing. In the same cohort, those who later died underwent brain autopsy to detect the presence of brainstem LBs [49]. Of 163 autopsied men without clinical PD or dementia, 17 were found to have incidental LBs. Those who scored in the lowest tertile of the BSIT were significantly more likely to have LBs at autopsy. Potentially conflicting findings were obtained in a study of 70 male twin pairs discordant for PD [50], 62 of whom agreed to undergo olfactory tests. At baseline, the authors confirmed impaired UPSIT scores in the affected twins, but not in their brothers who were rated normal. After a mean of 7.3 years, 28 brothers were still alive and, of them, 19 were retested using the 12 odour BSIT, whereby 2 had developed PD. Neither had impaired UPSIT at baseline, but the average decline in UPSIT percentile score in both was greater than the remaining 17, who had not developed the disease. It is suggested that smell testing may not be a reliable predictor. The dropout rate was unusually high and smell assessment was by different methods, that is, initially by UPSIT (40\u2010item) then by BSIT (12\u2010item). On the first occasion, the test was unsupervised; moreover, a 7.3\u2010year interval may have been too short.",

In some PD patients with normal UPSIT scores, the OERP was absent or delayed [33], which implies that the olfactory deficit may be more frequent than indicated by UPSIT. Pathology\u2010based studies indicate that the diagnostic error rate for PD is 10% or higher, and that olfactory identification is sometimes abnormal in other diseases showing Parkinsonism [51]. Mistaken diagnosis of PD occurs most often in MSA, PSP, vascular Parkinsonism and, occasionally in individuals with essential tremor. All these disorders may be characterized by either normal or slight impairment of olfaction. It is not yet known whether persons with normal UPSIT score are the very patients who have received an incorrect diagnosis, but prospective studies would resolve this issue.",

A variety of mechanisms account for swallowing difficulty, with evidence of dysfunction at either oropharyngeal or oesophageal level.

This comprised 6790 men without extrapyramidal disease at enrolment, followed up for 24 years, of whom 96 developed PD. The adjusted risk of PD in those with less than one bowel movement per day, compared with those with one or more per day, was increased almost threefold (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.3, 5.5), implying that constipation is a harbinger of PD [27]. Prevalence estimates of constipation in PD have been inconsistent because of variable definitions of constipation, but a conservative estimate would be at least 20% [65].

This procedure evaluates postganglionic noradrenergic cardiac sympathetic function. Heart rate variability may be abnormal in PD and is thought to reflect involvement of both sympathetic and parasympathetic pre\u2010 and postganglionic neurones [73]. Incidental LBs have been found in the cervical sympathetic ganglia and cardiac plexus [74]. In another study, it was clearly shown that tyrosine hydroxylase\u2010immunoreactive nerve fibres in the heart had almost entirely disappeared in patients with PD (and DLB), whereas they were well preserved in all those with PSP and pure Alzheimer's disease [75]. Only one patient with PD displayed abnormalities in the sympathetic ganglia, which indicates that cardiac sympathetic denervation precedes neuronal loss there. Autonomic failure presaging a Parkinsonian syndrome has been shown in two patients [76], but, to date, there have been no long\u2010term prospective epidemiological studies of cardiac function. One investigation showed a significant correlation between MIBG uptake and olfactory disorder in 26 patients with PD (but not MSA), thereby confirming the close association of these two modalities [77].",

The pathophysiology is not understood fully but most likely reflects cellular changes found in the Parkinson neuropathological stages 1 and 2, involving the reticular formation, coeruleus/subcoeruleus complex, pedunculopontine nucleus and hypothalamus [80]. In the prospective Honolulu\u2010Asia Ageing Study [81], 43 of 3078 men aged 71\u201393 years developed PD over a 7\u2010 to 10\u2010year period, and those reporting excessive daytime sleepiness were approximately three times more likely to develop PD (OR 3.3; 95% CI 1.4, 7.0). According to one source [82], 11/29 subjects with unexplained REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) subsequently developed Parkinsonism, complementing the finding of decreased striatal transporter uptake in RBD by others [83]. In other studies of olfaction and sleep [84, 85, 86], many RBD patients had significantly impaired smell function, once more implying that olfaction and RBD are early features. A difficulty with most of these studies, however, is the lack of post mortem confirmation. The investigation by Iranzo and co\u2010workers [87] is of particular interest in this regard. Apart from corroborating the suspected status of RBD as a precursor of PD, they document the time interval between onset of RBD and clinically manifest sporadic PD. In seven patients, the latent period was on average 12 years (range 3\u201317 years). Given that RBD is a sign of PD stage 2 pathology, this estimate provides a lower time limit for the presymptomatic phase and suggests that the earliest evidence of PD pathology (stage 1) would be 15\u201320 years before the onset of typical clinical manifestations.",

Nasal biopsy specimens from seven patients with symptomatic PD [101] were compared with four anosmic controls using antibodies against olfactory marker protein (OMP), neurotubulin, protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) and mRNA for OMP. Irregular areas of olfactory epithelium were positive for PGP 9.5 and neurotubulin but mostly negative for OMP, although mRNA for OMP was found in the olfactory cleft and respiratory mucosa. In this small series, there was no clear difference between PD and anosmic controls; however, sections were not examined for presence of LNs/LBs, and it could be argued that those with anosmia may have been in the presymptomatic phase of PD. Daniel and Hawkes [102] examined olfactory bulbs and tracts in eight controls as well as eight patients with a clinical and pathological diagnosis of PD taken from the United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Brain Bank. All PD cases contained LBs, which were most numerous in the anterior olfactory nucleus but also were found in mitral cells, the first projection neurones to receive input from the bipolar neurones in the olfactory epithelium. It was subsequently shown that loss of neurones in the anterior olfactory nucleus correlated with disease duration [103]. One report [104] suggested that expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the olfactory bulb is increased 100\u2010fold, and that the consequent excess of dopamine might explain the hyposmia that develops in PD. Braak and colleagues [22] confirmed the presence of PD\u2010related lesions in mitral cells and tufted neurones of the olfactory bulb and in projection neurones of the anterior olfactory nucleus, which is dispersed throughout the olfactory tract. A tightly woven network of LNs rapidly develops within the anterior olfactory nucleus. From there, the pathology tends to spread slowly into more remote olfactory sites (olfactory tubercle, piriform and periamygdalear cortex, entorhinal cortex of the ambient gyrus) [105] without advancing into non\u2010olfactory cortical areas [8, 22, 24].",

As in the brain, only a few of the many neuronal types within the ENS [111, 112, 113] are prone to develop PD\u2010associated lesions (Figure 2A,B\n). Once again, the vulnerable cells apparently are projection neurones with a long and unmyelinated axon [13]. The inhibitory nitrergic vasoactive intestinal polypeptide neurones have been shown to develop LNs and LBs [109, 110]. Axons containing \u03b1\u2010synuclein from the submucous plexus have been seen to protrude through the muscle layer of the mucosa, extending widely and ramifying within the mucosal lamina propria [88] (2, 3). Axons of affected ENS cells contain thread\u2010like or spindle\u2010shaped LNs of varying size. In the mucosal lamina propria, the unmyelinated axons are only micrometers away from the body's innermost environment, their only protection being a single layer of epithelial cells (2, 3). Such involvement of the enteric nerve cell plexuses may represent a particularly early event \u2013 if not the earliest vagal\u2010associated event \u2013 because LNs were observed both in clinically diagnosed cases and in non\u2010symptomatic individuals with PD\u2010related brain lesions limited to the lower brainstem [88]. In summary, the studies indicate that early involvement of the ENS with widespread and thinly distributed lesions throughout the walls of the upper gastrointestinal tract is accompanied by mild CNS lesions. It remains to be seen whether ENS lesions also occur in the absence of lesions in the brain.",

Anatomical analysis reveals a continuous chain of long\u2010axoned and sparsely myelinated projection neurones that interconnect not only the olfactory epithelium but also the ENS with the brain (Figure 3) and, within the brain, all of the vulnerable regions [23]. After uptake, such a neurotropic pathogen might utilize these pathways and progress within the nervous system by way of axonal transport and trans\u2010synaptic transmission [121, 122, 123, 124]",

The substances are transported to the cell body via the axon [125, 126, 127, 128]. Neurotropic viruses that pass from the surroundings into axons of susceptible nerve cells can be prevented from doing so by the existence of a myelin sheath, which functions as a physical barrier against virus penetration [129]. Thus, the absence of a myelin sheath around axons of the first neurones in the potential chain of vulnerable projection neurones may facilitate entrance and damage by viruses or other pathogens [125, 127, 130, 131, 132]. In addition, most of the neuronal types located within the CNS are protected against uptake of substances from the extracellular milieu beyond the CNS by the blood\u2013brain barrier. Only axons of nerve cells that project from the olfactory epithelium into the CNS and those that project from the CNS into the periphery, such as the preganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic fibres, lack such a protective barrier. Accordingly, an intravenous injection of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) results in retrograde labelling of the dorsal motor vagal nucleus [133].",

From the enteric plexuses, the prospective pathogen may gain access retrogradely to the CNS via parasympathetic pathways (vagus; Figure 3) and, thereafter, through post\u2010 and preganglionic sympathetic fibres. Once in the CNS, the disease process could ascend from spinal cord and lower brainstem through vulnerable portions of the basal mid\u2010 and forebrain until it reaches the cerebral cortex (Figure 4A\n).

Despite many negative studies that searched for direct evidence of influenza A in PD [137, 138, 139, 140, 141], nearly all pointed out that influenza A behaves as a persistent virus possibly capable of initiating autoimmunity.

In some mice, virus which had entered the olfactory bulb, spread via axons as far as the temporal lobe, hippocampus and cingulate cortex. Another study in the rat showed that HRP applied intranasally can be transported to the bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, as well as to cholinergic neurones of the diagonal band, serotonergic raphe neurones, and noradrenergic cells of the locus coeruleus [152]. It is not widely appreciated that direct connections exist between primary olfactory areas and the substantia nigra. For example, application of HRP into the olfactory tubercle results in anterograde labelling of the ventral tegmental area, the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra, and anterior olfactory nucleus.

On day 2, virus was detected in glial cells of the area postrema, in nuclei of the solitary tract, the vagal dorsal motor nucleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus, and the great raphe nucleus, whereas the hypoglossal nucleus was spared, as in PD. On day 3, there was rostral spread to involve the locus coeruleus, parvocellular reticular nucleus and periaqueductal grey, but not the substantia nigra. HSV\u20101\u2010positive neurones were seen in an oblique area corresponding to the human intermediate reticular zone [114]. This route of infection is shown in Figure 1 (left) and should be compared with the similar distribution of PD\u2010associated brainstem pathology (Figure 1, right). There are clear differences between this animal model and the pathology in humans. For instance, in contrast to the situation in PD, the trigeminal nerve in the rodents is involved and the substantia nigra is spared. Nevertheless, the rostral migration of HSV\u20101 has remarkable similarity to the suggested progression of the \u03b1\u2010synuclein pathology in PD (Figure 1) and reaffirms speculation that a neurotropic agent may utilize the vagus as a means of entering the medulla [22, 23]. The experiments of Blessing and co\u2010workers [154] are of additional interest in that they show that the first site of attack is in glial cells, which raises the possibility that residual virus in these cells may be responsible for the slow progression of PD.",

Conversely, pseudorabies virus spreads though both somatic and autonomic nerves. A strain of Hong Kong influenza virus inoculated intranasally in mice reached the CNS through afferent fibres of the olfactory, vagal, trigeminal and sympathetic nerves following replication in the respiratory mucosa [155]. Intranasally inoculated avian influenza virus in mice gave rise to lesions in lung and brainstem [156]. The main areas involved were the nuclei of the solitary tract and the trigeminal ganglia. Although haematogenous CNS spread is well documented in many viral strains, the findings of these experiments indicate that influenza viruses have preferential routes of access to the CNS along the vagus and olfactory nerves following replication in the lungs, but the pattern of brainstem involvement is variable; that is, the trigeminal nerve is sometimes involved, at other times spared. These observations have some parallels with the pattern of proposed CNS invasion in PD. Although no virus mirrors exactly the pathological profile seen in PD, it is possible that a particular viral strain might display a predilection for the olfactory and vagal routes of entry.",
