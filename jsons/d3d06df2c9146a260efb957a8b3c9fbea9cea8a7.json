Coronary artery spasm may cause variant angina pectoris',' and precipitate both unstable angina3 and myocardial infarction! Although spontaneous spasm has been observed at angiography', this occurrence is so uncommon that a reliable provocative test for spasm has been sought. Ergonovine maleate, a vasoconstrictor, was first used as a test for coronary artery disease in 1949 by Stein', and recently coronary artery spasm has been provoked by ergonovine in patients with either fixed coronary arterial obstruction or normal coronary arteries6\" The present study evaluated the diagnostic use of ergonovine in patients with chest pain but without significant coronary obstruction.",
