This would place pandemic influenza not far above smallpox and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). However, this unexpected theoretical analysis, if it is not flawed, gives us more practical opportunities to break the chain of infection of a pandemic using antiviral drugs and vaccines in association with well tried techniques such as quarantine (social distancing) basic hygiene and masks. Fortunately, there are now two classes of antiviral drugs, the neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) such as oseltamivir and zanamivir, and the older M2 blockers such as amantadine and rimantadine [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8].",

At that time the human population density was too low to sustain influenza, which requires a continual person-to-person spread. At that point in our history, influenza was a disease of birds. Only in the next 1000 years or so would there be sufficient people in the world for the virus to spread, and at this stage we believe it jumped from birds to humans. Ever since then the main reservoir of the virus has been birds, mainly the continent-crossing and migrating, geese and ducks. Often the virus causes a silent infection in the birds with no disease, i.e. they are silent carriers. Unlike in humans, in birds the virus infects the gut as well as most other organs in addition to the lungs, and birds excrete the virus in droppings.",

Strategic stocks will be held for one-quarter of the population on the basis that a 25% clinical attack rate was typical of the later pandemics of the last century. Both the NIs and amantadine can also be used to prevent infection, and an additional sensible approach is to use post-exposure prophylaxis.

A drug-resistant mutant was identified in two of eight treated patients, but studies with other NI-resistant mutants have shown that they are less pathogenic and less contagious, at least in animal models.
