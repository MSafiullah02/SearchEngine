            "text": "Adolescence is a unique period of development that requires special consideration in study design, statistical analyses, and interpretation of results. Biologically, the onset of adolescence is defined by pubertal surges in hormones that can impact neurodevelopment. Phenotypically, adolescence is characterized by a period of increased sensation/noveltyseeking that may manifest in risk-taking behaviors, heightened emotionality, and greater peer influence. Neurobiologically, adolescence is a time when foundational neurocognitive processes are in place and brain systems are predominantly undergoing specialization to optimally match neurobiological/genetic predisposition with the demands of the particular environment. Conceptually, adolescence has unique features including the transition to stabilization of neurobehavioral processes into adulthood, such as in cognitive development, as well as processes that show peak expression, such as in models of affective development. Each of these characterizations has critical implications for studying adolescent brain development, both in normative populations, as well as in clinical presentations, many which first emerge during this period. Below, we contextualize these characterizations of adolescence and discuss key considerations regarding research in adolescent brain development and their implications for understanding psychopathology. While our focus is on study design, statistical analysis, and data interpretation for neuroimaging studies of brain development, many of these also apply to behavioral studies that model developmental change.",

Cohort-sequential/accelerated longitudinal designs, which follow multiple cohorts with various starting ages, may be better able to isolate developmental and visit effects through the inclusion of cross-sectional effects. However, they may be more limited in the ability to leverage within-subject developmental effects, given the potential moderating effects of initial age. Importantly, both designs have limitations in attrition and scan failures, which can introduce bias (e.g., over representing willing participants who may be more mature). We suggest investigators optimize data collection for their planned analyses and known sources of error. When the aim is to model subject-specific developmental trajectories, as in the neurodevelopment of individual differences, a single cohort design is optimal, but with consideration to confounding non-developmental visit effects. Alternatively, group-level normative developmental changes and their physiological underpinnings may be better suited by an accelerated longitudinal design that can control for non-developmental visit effects. Simulation studies can be particularly useful in modeling these effects prior to data collection, informing sample size and requisite power that can be tailored to study-specific factors (e.g., reliability of included measurements, predicted attrition rate).",

This is critically needed especially with the multiplecomparison thresholding techniques used in neuroimaging and the relatively low reliability of many functional measures. Initial investigations in the ABCD dataset have already delineated important implications in this regard, including effects of data collection site and scanner manufacturer (2) . Importantly, large datasets can also be leveraged to replicate findings regarding normative development and deviations associated with psychopathology (3).",

Inverse forms of age (e.g., 1/age) are particularly important for modelling adolescence as they can capture fast growth during childhood, deceleration in adolescence, and stabilization in adulthood. In comparison, quadratic models provide the opportunity to identify peaks during adolescence. Exploratory analyses that test several functional forms should balance model fit with model complexity and use information criteria (e.g., Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) / Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)) for model selection. More recently, algorithmic approaches have been adopted for fitting non-linear developmental trajectories (e.g., General Additive Models). These approaches have many key advantages, including flexible and quantitatively-defined functional forms and permit the examination of age-periods of significant change (4), which can delineate plasticity and growth that can inform predictive models for risk for psychopathology (5) and opportunities for effective interventions, though they often require very large sample sizes. In addition, wellpowered models of normative development can be used as a template from which to assess impairment given the age of subjects (6) .",

Thus, limiting artifacts during imaging acquisition and use of state-of-the-science approaches to identify and mitigate these effects in the acquired data (e.g., global signal regression, despiking, and template-based artifact removal) are critical. Given that artifact removal techniques can also remove meaningful signal, it becomes important to characterize information loss that varies systematically with age (e.g., global signal regression (7)). After addressing artifacts in \"pre-processing\" stages, it is also important to test, report, and potentially control for any remaining associations with age/pubertal status. Additionally, missing data needs to be integrated in analyses to ensure representative sampling.",

This is particularly important given our stillemerging field, which may lead to multiple interpretations that are critical to move towards increased transparency and reproducibility. For example, task-based fMRI group differences showing lower BOLD activation in adolescents or clinical groups compared to adults or healthy populations could be due to limited regional engagement or alternatively, varied strategies, or compensatory processes (8) . Consideration of alternative interpretations, including behavioral performance (e.g., task difficulty, distinguishing between correct and error trials, response speed), and systems-level changes are thus critical. Within this context, both exploratory and hypothesis driven designs are needed, but with clear rationale and predictions based on the current status of the literature and informed by open science approaches.
