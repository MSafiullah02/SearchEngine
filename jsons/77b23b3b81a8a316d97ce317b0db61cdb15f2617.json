Such materials are becoming more widely investigated for possible use in various settings including clinics, industry and even the home. The most common and important use of antimicrobial coatings has been in the healthcare setting for sterilization of medical devices to prevent hospital-associated infections, which have accounted for almost 100,000 deaths in the United States. In addition to medical devices, linens and clothing can provide a suitable environment for many bacteria, fungi and viruses to grow when in contact with the human body which allows for the transmission of infectious disease (Chapter 26: Microbial Growth Control 2018) .",

They generated nanoscaled CuO by thermal plasma technology. CuO nanoparticles were effective in killing a range of bacterial pathogens involved in hospital-acquired infections. In addition, Cioffi et al. (Chien et al. 2015 ) manufactured polymer composites including copper nanoparticles with antifungal and bacteriostatic properties. Polymer/metal nanocomposites are a viable choice, as a spinnable coating capable of releasing metal species to a broth of living organisms in a controlled manner is an extremely interesting material for a number of biotechnological applications. At their study, a polymer-based nanocomposite loading stabilized copper nanoparticles is proposed as a biostatic coating, and systematic correlations between material properties and biological effects are established. Researchers in Japan (Chung et al. 2004 ) have discovered a nickel-alloy coating with antibacterial properties, which is believed to be effective at reducing the SARS coronavirus. SARS is believed to be spread through close contact, such as coughing, sneezing or contact with faeces of patients. It can also be transmitted when people touch surfaces contaminated with the virus. The use of this antibacterial material has the potential to radically alter the quality and cleanliness of laboratory and pharmaceutical workplaces. In laboratory tests, the nickel-alloy coating developed by Kobe Steel reduced the growth of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, or mouse coronavirus), which is a close relative of the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus (CoV). Both MHV and SARS CoV are in the same group of coronaviruses (Chung et al. 2004; Yilmaz Atay 2013) .",

Zone of inhibition is produced by the silver-loaded polymer coating against the bacteria representing its antibacterial effect. All Ag nanoparticle-reinforced polymer composites showed a good inhibition zone for S. aureus and E. coli.

Ever since the broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of this material was first proposed by Allan and Hardwiger (Allan and Hardwiger 1979) , along with great commercial potential, the antimicrobial property of chitosan and its derivatives have been attracting great attention from researchers. Investigation of the antimicrobial properties of chitosan has been a long journey of scientific exploration and technological development. The journey began two decades ago, with studies on the biological phenomena arising from foodborne and soilborne pathogenic fungi in the food and agriculture industries (Rabea et al. 2003) . In light of their intimate relationship with human activities, bacteria rightly began to receive more attention in the search for efficacious antimicrobials. The studies at that time were typically carried out via chemical, biochemical, microbiological and medical assays of chitosan and its derivatives. In some cases, but rarely so, molecular and cell approaches were utilized. The outcomes obtained through this period suggested that antimicrobial activities of chitosan and its derivatives relied on numerous intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as pH and molecular weight (Mw). Some basic hypotheses about underlying antimicrobial mechanisms were also proposed (Zivanovic et al. 2004 ). Based on the outcomes, various antimicrobial agents based on chitosan or its derivatives emerged. At the same time, since biocide-resistant bacteria and fungi, growing public health awareness of pathogenic microorganism raised demands for safe and efficacious agents that were less prone to stimulating development of resistance. In addition to tremendous advancements in molecular biological, pharmaceutical, cell biological technologies and detecting methods, nanotechnology emerged and began playing an extraordinary role, carrying the potential to extend antimicrobial treatment to the atomic level. The many approaches that have been used in studying antimicrobial activities of chitosan and its derivatives have given rise to various physical forms of chitosan in differing methods, from the original solution applied in agriculture to film structure in food sector and to ubiquitous pharmaceutical nanostructure materials (Kong et al. 2010) .",

Therefore, in the past two decades, extensive investigations have been carried out to increase solubility of chitosan in water and broaden its applications by preparing functional derivatives of chitosan such as carboxymethyl chitosan and quaternized carboxymethyl chitosan, chitosan-N-arginine by reacting amino groups of chitosan with arginine, N-alkylated disaccharide chitosan, water-soluble maltose chitosan derivative and water-soluble quaternary.

The degree of +, Mg-2 + 2 deacetylation, which determines the content of free amino groups in polysaccharides, can be employed to differentiate between chitin and chitosan. It is very well known that the degree of deacetylation is one of the most important chemical characteristics, which could influence the performance of chitosan in many applications (Hosseinnejad and Jafari 2016).",

It is known that chitosan's antimicrobial activity is influenced by a number of factors that act in an orderly and independent fashion. The most prevalent proposed antibacterial activity of chitosan is by binding to the negatively charged bacterial cell wall causing disruption of the cell, thus altering the membrane permeability, followed by attachment to DNA causing inhibition of DNA replication and subsequently cell death (Nagy et al. 2011) . Another possible mechanism is that chitosan acts as a chelating agent that electively binds to trace metal elements causing toxin production and inhibiting microbial growth (Divya et al. 2017) .",

When the positive charge density of chitosan strengthens, the antibacterial property will increase consequently, as is the case with quaternized chitosan and chitosan metal complex (Xie et al. 2007 ). On the contrary, if the polycationic property of chitosan is deprived or reversed, the corresponding antibacterial capacity will be weakened or lost. Besides protonation, the number of amino groups linking to C-2 on chitosan backbones is important in electrostatic interaction. Large amount of amino groups are able to enhance the antibacterial activity. Accordingly, native chitosan with higher DD shows a stronger inhibitory effect than a molecule with a lower DD. Moreover, it has been reported that asparagine N-conjugated chitosan oligosaccharide that possesses two positively charged sites provides strong interaction with carboxyl-negative charges on the bacterial cell wall (Jeon et al. 2001) . Another attempt to increase the amount of amino groups via substituting amino by formamidine obtained a guanidinylated chitosan, which showed better antibacterial activity than chitosan (Hu et al. 2007a, b) .",

Virgin LDPE and 1%, 3% and 5% LDPE/CS films tested as packaging films for chill-stored tilapia showed that samples packed in LDPE films were rejected by seventh day, whereas fish packed in 1%, 3% and 5% LDPE/CS films remained acceptable up to 15 days.

One study reported that a higher DD with more positive charge was especially successful in inhibiting the growth of S. aureus, suggesting that antibacterial activity of chitosan towards S. aureus was enhanced with increasing DD (Takahashia et al. 2008) . Concerning chitosan derivatives, antimicrobial activity mostly depends on DS of the grafting groups. Investigation of the antibacterial activities of water-soluble N-alkylated disaccharide chitosan derivatives against Escherichia coli and S. aureus revealed that the antibacterial activity of chitosan derivatives is affected by the DS of disaccharides and the type of disaccharide present in the molecule (Yang et al. 2005) . The same study suggested that, irrespective of the kind of disaccharide linked to the chitosan molecule, a DS of 30-40%, in general, produced the most pronounced antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus and that both microorganisms were most susceptible to cellobiose chitosan derivative DS 30-40% and maltose chitosan derivative DS 30-40%, respectively, among the various chitosan derivatives examined (Kong et al. 2010 ).",

Totally dry samples are virtually incapable of releasing their energy stored in chemical bonds to initiate interaction. Hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity are conceptions also based upon water ambience, upon which the manner of antimicrobial interaction of chitosan is determined. The hydrophilic characteristics of chitosan profoundly determine water solubility. The use of chitosan is limited by the compound's poor solubility in water (Dutta et al. 2004) . Chemical modifications as an approach are efficient in improving the water solubility of chitosan and its derivatives and widening their applications (Xie et al. 2007 ). The creation of watersoluble chitosan and its derivatives has been a central goal of investigations of antimicrobial activity, which have included saccharization, alkylation, acylation, quaternization and metallization. As one example, quaternary ammonium chitosan can be prepared by introducing quaternary ammonium group on dissociative hydroxyl or amino group. For chitosan and its derivatives, the hydrophilic-lipophilic variation influences the antimicrobial properties. The hydrophobic characteristic of N-acylated chitosan can be favourable for the interaction of polymer molecule and bacterial cell, where the hydrophobicity of NHCS0.5 (N-hexanoyl chitosans, corresponding to a molar ratio of 0.5 compared with chitosan residue) is likely to be a contributing factor for its enhanced inhibitory effect (Hu et al. 2007a, b) . In another study, the presence of a long aliphatic chain facilitated the absorption and enhanced the effect of a substituted LMW chitosan, N\u00c0/2(3)-(dodec-2enyl) succinoyl/chitosans, onto cell walls via hydrophobic interaction with cell wall proteins (Kong et al. 2010 ).",

Metal ions that combine with cell wall molecules of microorganism are crucial for stability of the cell wall. Chitosan-mediated chelation of such metal ions has often been implicated as a possible mode of antimicrobial action (Rabea et al. 2003) . Not only does chelation play a part in acid condition, it is also able to combine divalent metal ions in neutral condition. Additionally, via chelating capacity, chitosan metal complex is prepared and exerts strong antimicrobial activity (Kong et al. 2010 ).",

Because chitosan is soluble in an acidic environment, and the molecule becomes polycationic as pH below the molecule's pKa (6.3-6.5) (Lim and Hudson 2004) . It has been reported that chitosan displayed antibacterial activity only in an acid environment, as is not proven to be strictly correct. Chitosan definitely shows stronger inhibitory effect at lower pHs, with inhibitory activity weakening with increasing pH. The failure of chitosan to remain bactericidal at pH 7 may be due to the presence of a large majority of positively uncharged amino groups as well as poor solubility of chitosan (Sudarshan et al. 1992 ). However, chitosan and its derivatives completely lose their antimicrobial activities under neutral condition as reported by some workers which may not be totally correct. A novel approach of antibacterial research, chitosan microsphere (CM) in solid dispersing system, showed that CM sample with DD of 62.6% exerted inhibitory effect uniquely among the three DD (97.5, 83.5, 62.6%) under neutral condition (Kong et al. 2008) . The CM samples in this experiment retained the properties of native chitosan without alteration. Another research observed that antibacterial activity of the N-alkylated chitosan derivatives (DS 30-40%) against E. coli increased as the pH increased from 5.0 and reached a maximum around the pH of 7.0-7.5 (Yang et al. 2005) . These results also verify that positive charge on the amino groups is not the sole factor resulting in antimicrobial activities. However, little is known about the antimicrobial activity of chitosan under alkaline conditions (Kong et al. 2010 ).",

First, increase of metal ions, especially divalent ions, could attenuate the effective chelating capacity of chitosan. With the addition of 0.05 mol/L magnesium ions into a medium, the inhibitory ratio of chitosan samples decreased badly and resulted in abrogated antibacterial activity (Kong et al. 2008) . In another study, 10 and 25 mM concentrations of divalent cations reduced the antibacterial activity of shrimp chitosan against E. coli in the order of Ba. Furthermore, the addition of Zn2+ and Ca2+ ions inhibited the antibacterial activity of chitosan most effectively compared with Ba2+, Ca2+, Mg2 + 2+ and Mg ions (Chung et al. 2005) . Secondly, along with polycationic chitosan, existing cations in medium may interact competitively with the negative components dominating on the cell wall of bacterium, consequently weakening the antimicrobial activity. Addition of anion affected the antibacterial efficacy as well (Kong et al. 2010 ).",

This explains why soluble chitosan and its derivatives are more effective in inhibiting bacterial growth. According to the literatures (Chung et al. 2005; Xie et al. 2007) , the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chitosan derivatives is significantly decreased against all tested bacteria than those of native chitosan. Meanwhile, owing to a sufficient touch with solution, soluble chitosan and its derivatives are readily affected by outer environmental factors as well as many intrinsic factors. In one study, chitosan derivatives (chitosan and maltose, glucose, fructose, glucosamine) produced through the Maillard reaction enhanced the solubility of the native chitosan. Among them, chitosan-glucosamine derivative appeared to be more effective than other chitosan or chitosan derivatives as a natural bactericidal agent (Chung et al. 2005) . Quaternary ammonium chitosan is another major example to improve solubility of chitosan by introducing hydrophilic groups into molecule. After quaternization, derivatives exhibited better water solubility and stronger antibacterial activity as compared to chitosan (Xie et al. 2007; Kong et al. 2010 ).",

The shift of physical state is sure to bring variation of its antimicrobial efficiency. Nanoparticles have less inhibition effect on S. aureus ATCC 29737 than the polymers in free soluble form since nanoparticles have less positive charge available to bind to the negative bacterial cell wall (Sadeghi et al. 2008) .

In several studies, stronger antibacterial activity was apparent against Gram-negative bacteria than Gram-positive bacteria (Chung et al. 2004; No et al. 2002) , while in another study Gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible, perhaps as a consequence of the Gram-negative outer membrane barrier. Still many workers demonstrated that there were no significant differences observed between the antibacterial activities and the bacterium. Various initial reaction materials and conditions contribute to the diverse consequences.

Incorporation of essential oils (EOs) in chitosan-based coatings has gained interest in the agricultural sciences owing to the bactericidal and fungicidal properties associated with these volatile compounds (Ali et al. 2015) . Recently, different EOs, such as clove, carvacrol, oregano and lemongrass, have been successfully incorporated into chitosan showing strong antimicrobial activity (Kong et al. 2010) against a wide range of microorganisms. Also Ojagh et al. (Ojagh et al. 2010) showed that a unique compatibility can be achieved between chitosan and cinnamon EOs; their incorporation improved the antibacterial properties of chitosan. Films containing cinnamon EOs are useful for coating of highly perishable foods such as fish and poultry. In a further experiment by G\u00f3mez-Estaca et al. (2010) , a complex of gelatin-chitosan film incorporating clove EOs was applied to fish during chilled storage. Results of this study revealed that clove film delayed or even prevented both the growth of microorganisms and the occurrence of total volatile nitrogen. Therefore film incorporating clove EOs could assure an extended shelf-life for chill-stored fish. Generally, the structure of chitosan/metal complexes depends on chitosan/metal ion molar ratio, type of metal ion, molecular weight and deacetylation of chitosan as well as the preparation conditions (Hosseinnejad and Jafari 2016).",

In particular, a broad spectrum of activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were demonstrated for gold-, silver-or copper-loaded chitosan nanoparticles. Such nanoparticles were prepared by adding metal ion solutions into chitosan nanosuspension or by reducing a soluble salt of the metal in the presence of chitosan solutions (Rhim et al. 2006 ). The antibacterial activities by disk diffusion method were evaluated for nanoparticulate colloidal dispersion or in form of a thin film, in which the metal nanoparticles remained embedded inside the chitosan polymeric matrix. In all cases, a remarkable antimicrobial effect was observed for all the examined bacteria (S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, E. coli and S. typhimurium) with inhibition diameters ranging from 8 to 10 mm. Silver-based nanocomposites are the most frequently investigated metal/chitosan complexes. In order to investigate if the greater antibacterial effect of the silver-based chitosan composite material was exerted by the presence of silver as metallic nanoparticles or ions, Kumar-Krishnan et al. prepared chitosan films containing Ag nanoparticles or Ag + ions at different concentrations and tested them for their activity against S. aureus and E. coli. They found that the maximum bactericidal effect of the chitosan films was obtained with those containing 1% w/w of silver nanoparticles or 2% w/w of silver ions, concluding that Ag/chitosan nanoparticles have higher antibacterial effect than Ag + 2+ and Zn ions. The maximum 2+ antibacterial effect was observed at a concentration close of that of the electrical percolation threshold (Kumar-Krishnan et al. 2015) . It was also proposed that nanoparticles size could affect the antimicrobial effect. Indeed, smaller silver nanoparticles have a higher specific surface area and release Ag + ions at a faster rate (Perinelli et al. 2018) .",

Natural biological molecules are currently being evaluated for their antibiofilm activity in order to develop alternative preventive or therapeutic rationale. In this context, chitosan-streptomycin conjugates/gold nanoparticles were evaluated in terms of their anti-biofilm properties against Gram-negative P. aeruginosa and S. typhimurium and Gram-positive Listeria monocytogenes and S. aureus (Mu et al. 2016) . In particular, the chitosan-streptomycin gold nanoparticles showed a disruption effect on biofilms formed by Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria and an inhibition effect on biofilm formation of Gram-negative bacteria. The conjugation of streptomycin to chitosan and gold nanoparticles facilitated its penetration into the biofilm matrix and improved the contact with the bacterial surface, thereby enhancing its bactericidal effect. Another application of chitosan nanoparticles is represented by photodynamic activation. Darabpour et al. investigated the effect of chitosan nanoparticles on the efficiency of methylene blue (MB)-mediated antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (APDI) of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms. The authors observed that chitosan nanoparticles enhanced the efficacy of MB-APDI, causing the disruption of biofilm structure and subsequently a deeper and effective penetration of MB into S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms (Darabpour et al. 2016) . The use of chitosan nanoparticles has also been reported to combat biofilm formed by oral pathogens on tooth surfaces, which are associated with human caries, gingivitis and periodontitis. ",

            "text": "Skin wound treatment is an important research area. Poor wound management could lead to severe complications and loss of function. Wound healing is a complex process where numerous steps take place in order to re-establish the normal functionality of the skin. It includes an inflammatory, a proliferation and, finally, a remodelling phase. Many factors have to be considered when designing a wound material to provide an adequately moist environment and allow gas exchange in order to avoid dehydration and exudates accumulation. Moreover, wound-related infections represent a serious problem since bacteria can easily invade the tissues and proliferate, hampering the regeneration process. Hence, agents that are able to prevent infection and promote wound healing have been extensively explored. Chitosan has been widely applied as wound dressing due to its properties that include biocompatibility, biodegradability, haemostatic and antibacterial activities (Siafaka et al. 2016 ). As such, chitosan has been approved in commercial medical devices for topical applications in wound healing (e.g. HemCon bandages). Moreover, the gradual depolymerization of chitosan to N-acetyl glucosamine promotes fibroblast proliferation, thereby accelerating wound closure. In another study, a nanofibrous membrane made of chitosan and silk fibroin was fabricated. Its antibacterial activity against Gram-negative Escherichia coli was demonstrated to be directly dependent on the chitosan concentration in the composite nano-dressing, with a higher effect increasing chitosan proportion (Cai et al. 2010) . A slightly different result was obtained by Sarhan and Azzazy that studied the combined antibacterial activity of honey, chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol electrospun nanofibrous wound dressing. These nanofibres showed a pronounced antibacterial effect against S. aureus, with an increased effect on chitosan concentration, while a weak antibacterial activity was observed against E. coli (Sarhan and Azzazy 2015) . Recent studies reported the loading of different compounds such as antibiotics, antimicrobial agents and metal nanoparticles within the chitosan nanofibres in order to increase chitosan antibacterial activity and accelerate the wound-healing process (Perinelli et al. 2018 ).",

In fact, textiles, especially those made of natural fibres such as proteins (silk) or cellulose (cotton), represent a favourable environment for the proliferation of different microorganisms including bacteria or fungi, due to extensive surface area, high porosity and ability to retain humidity. The research in the field of antimicrobial textiles has a great impact on many technological applications such as clothing, furnishing, filtering, medical devices, healthcare and hygienic products. With the increasing interest in the use of silk, collagen or cellulose for the production of membranes and supports for biomedical applications (as regenerative medicine), there is an enhanced demand for safe and biodegradable antimicrobial agents. Chitosan is a good candidate, with attractive characteristics in comparison to other commonly used organic antimicrobial agents (e.g. phenolic and formaldehyde derivatives), especially in terms of toxicological profile. The major drawbacks regarding the use of chitosan include its poor solubility in most of the solvents except acidic aqueous solution, the high viscosity of concentrated high MW chitosan solution for coating application and the thermal stability of chitosan. Nevertheless, some commercial textile products based on chitosan are available on market. Although the commercial products have reached the market more than 10 years ago, the research on the use of chitosan in textiles still has been flourishing. Different strategies have been applied in textiles and fabrics to improve the antimicrobial activity of chitosan. Microencapsulation is one of the most explored approaches (Ibrahim et al. 2017; Perinelli et al. 2018 ).",

            "text": "Food industry is facing the problem of microbial contamination. Foodborne bacteria are responsible for many serious human infections, and they can also accelerate food spoilage with enormous economic losses. In this regard, food packaging represents a solution to prevent and retard bacterial invasion and proliferation. Different biopolymers, characterized by a good environmental profile, biodegradability and biocompatibility, have been screened in order to find alternatives to the conventional petroleum-derived materials for food packaging. Many research focused on the development of chitosan-based systems, as the intrinsic properties of chitosan could enhance the antimicrobial efficacy of the packaging. The film-forming properties of chitosan have led to the development of film packaging materials in combination with various natural polysaccharides such as starch, pectin and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC). An example was given by M\u00f6ller et al., who studied the antimicrobial activity of a chitosan-HPMC film against Listeria monocytogenes, demonstrating a complete growth inhibition. When chitosan-HPMC films were cross-linked with citric acid by the amino groups of chitosan, the antibacterial activity decreased drastically, thus demonstrating the critical role of the protonated amino groups of chitosan for the antimicrobial activity (M\u00f6ller et al. 2004 ). Chitosan nanofibres have also been exploited as a packaging material by many research groups due to their numerous advantages such as biocompatibility, large surface area and good functional and antimicrobial properties. Nanocarrier systems have attracted an increasing attention in food packaging, being able to load different active compounds, including those with low solubility and stability. Chitosan nanoparticles have been intensively exploited for this purpose, and with their well-known antimicrobial properties, a potential combined effect with the loaded active compound could be achieved. As proof of concept study, Feyzioglu and Tornuk examined the antimicrobial activity of summer savoury essential oil-loaded chitosan nanoparticles against three different foodborne bacteria (E. coli, L. monocytogenes and S. aureus), showing the promising application in food packaging materials. Both chitosan nanoparticles and summer savoury essential oil-loaded chitosan nanoparticles displayed antibacterial activity, with the loaded nanoparticles demonstrating a higher effect (Feyzioglu and Tornuk 2016) (Perinelli et al. 2018 ).",

Generally, an ideal wound dressing material must be capable of absorbing the exuded liquid from the wounded area and should permit water evaporation at a certain rate and allow no microbial transport (Yang and Lin 2004) . As a key parameter regarding wound dressing, the antimicrobial property assessment is necessary for evaluating the eligibility and capability of the candidate. Polysaccharides, e.g. chitosan, owning hydrogel-forming properties have been considered to be advantageous in their application as a wound dressing materials . Chitosan-based materials have received much attention in this regard. Typically, there are four forms in which chitosan provides antimicrobial effect to wound dressing materials: fibre, membrane, sponge and hydrogel. The different approaches count on particular physicochemical characteristics of chitosan, which impart talent on specific displaying form. Majority of antimicrobial products perform their talent in fabric form. Micro-and nanofibre materials are suitable for preparing wound dressings. Among these, electrospinning is a favourable technique for producing continuous polymer fibres with diameters down to nanoscale range (Deitzel et al. 2001) . Because of unique properties such as high surface-to-volume ratio, high porosity and diameters in the nanoscale, electrospun mats made from ultrafine polymer fibres have been drawing great attention. One study reported the cross-linked QCh/PVP (quaternized chitosan/ polyvinylpyrrolidone) electrospun materials were efficient in inhibiting growth of Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria (Ignatova et al. 2007) , while, in their previous work, the antibacterial activity of cross-linked electrospun QCh/PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) mats made of quaternized chitosan derivative against S. aureus was observed to be bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic. PVP and PVA are both non-toxic, biocompatible and highly hydrophilic, possess good complexation properties and have good film-forming ability, which are crucial for wound-healing materials (Kong et al. 2010 ).",

            "text": "As it is explained above, chitosan has positively charged amino group which interacts with negatively charged microbial cell membranes. This leads to the leakage of proteinaceous and other intracellular constituents of the microorganisms. That may be one of the reasons of having antimicrobial feature of chitosan (Shahidi et al. 1999) . Another reason is related to the moves of chitosan on the outer surface of bacteria. At a lower concentration (0.2 mg/mL), polycationic chitosan can be probably bound to the negatively charged bacterial surface for causing agglutination. The larger number of positive charges may impart a positive charge to the bacterial surfaces in order to keep them in suspension at a higher concentration (Dutta et al. 2009; Y\u0131lmaz Atay and \u00c7elik 2017) . In the UV absorption studies, it was detected that chitosan causes the considerable losses of proteinic material for Pythium oaroecandrum at pH 5.8 (H. Liu et al. 2004) . Chitosan can bind tracing metals like a chelating agent and this can prevent the formation of toxic materials and the growth of microbes. By activating defensive processes in the host tissue, it can act as a water binding agent and also prevent various enzymes. Due to the penetration towards the nuclei of the microorganisms and the interference with the synthesis of mRNA and proteins, binding of chitosan with DNA and inhibition of mRNA synthesis take part (Sudarshan et al. 1992) . Some innate factors, such as structure of chitosan, its degree of polymerization, the host, the natural nutrient constituency, the chemical or nutrient composition of the substrates and the environmental conditions, can impress the antimicrobial activity of chitosan. This will be discussed later in this chapter. Coating materials including antimicrobial agents have been attractive areas for researchers due to preventing the growth of pathogenic bacteria. Chitosan has been still pointed out as an antimicrobial film or a forming agent because of its biodegradability, biocompatibility, cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity (Dutta et al. 2009 ).",

(1991) showed that at a lower pH, more protons are prosperous for protonation amino groups of chitosan molecules to form groups of -NH3+. Hence, it could be possible to see increasing electrostatic attractions between negatively charged dye anions and positively charged adsorption sites. Therefore, this will bring about an increase in dye adsorption. Chiou and Li (2003) presented similar explanations for the adsorption of RR 189 (reactive dye) on cross-linked chitosan beads. The adsorption was lower than acidic solution, for example, they can go down from pH 10.0 to 13.0. They expressed this action by the fact that chemical cross-linking reduces either the total number or the diameter of the pores in chitosan beads. Thus, the transferring of the dye molecule was more difficult (Hasan et al. 2008; Y\u0131lmaz Atay and \u00c7elik 2017) .",

            "text": "For the mentioned antibacterial tests, coated samples and agar discs are shown in Fig. 15 .10 after the antibacterial tests. In the test sample, there is not any antibacterial activity. The inhibition zones around those specimens can be clearly seen in chitosan colloid-reinforced coatings. Increasing the loading level of the chitosan also increases the inhibition radius in those samples. Regarding the samples including chitosan powder, antimicrobial effects are seen on the surface of the coated region. It means the antimicrobial property works with direct contact of chitosan powders on the surface. To obtain the better results, particle size can be decreased to nanoscale if possible, as by this way the antibacterial effect of the particles can be increased due to increasing of contact surfaces. However, some researchers observed that nanoparticles can have less inhibition effect on S. aureus ATCC 29737 than in free soluble form polymers. The reason is that nanoparticles have less positive charge for binding to the negative bacterial cell wall (Sadeghi et al. 2008 ). On the contrary, in another research, it was recorded that due to the special character of the nanoparticles, the chitosan nanoparticles can present higher antibacterial activity against S. aureus (Qi et al. 2004) . Similarly, larger surface area of the nanoparticle and affinity with bacterial cells, which yields a quantum-size effect, has influence in the antibacterial action (Kong et al. 2010) . In addition, the prohibition activity of chitosan depends on different types of factors, such as solid surface characteristic and the morphology. Particle size, membrane and fibre thickness cause to occur different results. It was investigated the effect of particle size and shape of chitosan powder on S. aureus, and it was recorded that antibacterial activity was improved by decreasing the particle size. Conversely, the antibacterial property of chitosan powders depends on the shape as well as specific surface area. The researchers showed that chitosan powders in the range of 74-500 \u03bcm looked like a flake or board, but they looked like spheres in the range of 37-63 \u03bcm (Kong et al. 2010; Phaechamud 2008; Y\u0131lmaz Atay and \u00c7elik 2017) .",

Investigations on its antimicrobial property are growing rapidly. Due to their multitude of application areas and people's environmental mindfulness, biodegradable, and non-toxic products from 'natural' sources are going to be more and more appealing for the replacement of synthetic compounds. Against other antibacterial materials, chitosan is a non-toxic, harmless and environmentally friendly vegetable material. Using this material at the points of our life will be more healthful for people. Therefore, the investigations of this material for the antibacterial studies need to be improved which will incorporate a combination of disciplines involving chemistry, physics, informatics, nanotechnology and genetic engineering. This will be beneficial for the exploitation of new generation of antimicrobial agents and for the development of new biomedicine. On the other hand, future works can focus on the use of chitosan in the composites to avoid lower pH values, as soluble chitosan is used as a generally acidic environment. It will be beneficial to clarify the molecular circumstance of the underlying mechanisms and their involvement to the antimicrobial action of chitosan.",
