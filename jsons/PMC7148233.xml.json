Interlinking is a crucial task in several domains, since it is quite often the case that real world entities are modeled, represented and gathered by different stakeholders, following different schemas, procedures and quality standards. As a result, multiple databases might exist for representing the same groups of real world entities, in heterogeneous ways. Examples include: person names, product names and spatio-textual entities (toponyms, POIs, addresses) in different data providers.",

A toponym might refer to a broad range of spatio-textual entities, from small places, to countries. In our problem setting, the name of a spatio-textual entity/toponym, is its only reliable attribute that can be used for identifying same entities; the other attributes, such as spatial coordinates, categories, extended textual descriptions, are either non-existent or of too low quality/accuracy to be used for interlinking. Consider the scenario of a toponym data provider that maintains a proprietary toponym database, and periodically enriches/extends it with toponym entities extracted from user check-ins in social media. It is quite often the case that a check-in regarding a specific place is performed in locations that are considerably distant from the actual place. In this case, the coordinates extracted for the specific place are inaccurate and might even hurt the interlinking process, e.g. by leading to the rejection of a link between two toponyms that are actually the same, but appear to have distant locations. The authors of [4] elegantly describe the problem of dealing with extremely noisy location coordinates in the Facebook database. In another scenario, the recognition and extraction of toponyms might be performed on documents (e.g. travel guides), where the coordinates of toponyms are non-existent. Further, in either scenario, no other properties of the toponyms, such as categories or extended textual descriptions, can generally be retrieved for the majority of the extracted toponyms.",

We take a different approach, claiming that domain knowledge is a critical factor for toponym interlinking that needs to be captured and incorporated within the interlinking process. To this end, we analyse a large toponym dataset, Geonames1, which contains, among other toponym metadata, alternative names for millions of toponyms. Based on the insights we gain, we build an elaborate meta-similarity function, LGM-Sim, that takes into account and incorporates within its processing steps the specificities of toponym names. Additionally, we derive training features from LGM-Sim, that can be used for interlinking via classification. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models in two settings: similarity-based and classification-based toponym interlinking.",

The meta-similarity proposed in [5] takes into account accentuation and other language-specific aspects of toponym names, in a four-stages process. The set of algorithms evaluated in [2] were assessed in the toponym interlinking problem by [12]. The authors experimented on place names listed in the GEOnet Names Server, that contains romanized toponyms from 11 different countries. Based on their study, no similarity measure achieves the highest accuracy in all datasets. In [4], the problem of business places deduplication is studied, taking a different approach. In the proposed solution, certain words (core terms) are identified, that are of higher significance in the name deduplication process. Based on these terms, a name model is constructed and properly combined with a spatial context model, using unsupervised learning algorithms.",

A framework for improving duplicate detection using learnable text distance functions is presented in [1], however, in this work too, generic string similarity measures are used for the feature scores computation. The authors of [15] extract features for location name, coordinates, location type and demographic information. Then, machine learning algorithms are used to weight all features to solve the spatial entity matching problem. The work in [16] proposes a machine learning based approach to detect duplicate location entities. For this, a proposed metric is calculated for each key feature consisting of name, address and category similarity that describe entity pairs. Then, these extracted features are fed in a classification model to decide whether two entities are duplicates or not. Suport Vector Machine (SVM) and an alternating Decision Tree classifiers are used to combine different similarity features in [9]. The authors consider a variety of features corresponding to place name similarity, geospatial footprint similarity, place type similarity, similarity measures corresponding to semantic relations and temporal similarity. Contrary to these works, our study bases the matching process exclusively on toponym names. Utilizing richer spatio-textual profiles that enable the construction of features based on location-based, temporal or categorical similarity is beyond the scope of this work.",

Similarly, most works reviewed in [14] do not take into account the specificities of toponyms, however, using these methods as baselines for comparison allows as to compare with a large part of the literature. Our preliminary work on the problem [6], presents a first version of the LGM-Sim, a meta-similarity function aiming to capture the specificities of toponyms.

Such methods consider as a given that the similarity functions they apply will be sufficiently accurate on identifying same entities, and focus on developing indexes, structures and schemes for optimizing the performance of the interlinking process, in terms of time-efficiency and scalability. Following a different rationale, the Magellan system, presented in [7], aims to provide the tools to end users to exploit a wide range of techniques related to the entity matching process under a unified framework. However, the implemented similarity functions are generic, widely adopted similarities that are not specialized or properly tuned for the setting of comparing geospatial entities. Further, an integral concept in Magellan is user interaction, prescribing pipelines where automated interlinking tasks and user feedback are iteratively combined. These categories of works on interlinking solve orthogonal/complementary problems and are not directly comparable to our proposed methods.",

An indicative example would be the toponym: \u201cSt. Paul\u2019s German Lutheran Church\u201d. In this case, \u201cChurch\u201d could be considered a non-core term, however, it is expected to be a frequent term.
