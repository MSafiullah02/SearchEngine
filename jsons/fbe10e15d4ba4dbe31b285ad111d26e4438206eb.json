This innovative form of cellular immunotherapy has been associated with remarkable response rates but is also associated with unique and often severe toxicities, which can lead to rapid cardiorespiratory and/or neurological deterioration. Multidisciplinary medical vigilance and the requisite health-care infrastructure are imperative to ensuring optimal patient outcomes, especially as these therapies transition from research protocols to standard care. Herein, authors representing the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators (PALISI) Network Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Subgroup and the MD Anderson Cancer Center CAR T Cell Therapy-Associated Toxicity (CARTOX) Program have collaborated to provide comprehensive consensus guidelines on the care of children receiving CAR T cell therapy.",

In the century following its first description, leukaemia remained a near uniformly fatal disease. In 1948, astute observations among children with leukaemia, made by Sidney Farber 2 , led to therapeutic breakthroughs -ushering in an era of hope. Since then, paediatric oncology cooperative group trials and pioneering work by E. Donnall Thomas on haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) among patients with leukaemia have led to dramatic improve ments in the cure rates of childhood ALL 3, 4 . Despite improvements in overall remission rates (ORRs) for children with ALL, until now, the cure rates for chil dren with relapsed and/or refractory disease remain disappointingly low 5, 6 . In the 1970s, E. Donnall Thomas considered a 15% salvage rate after disease relapse to be a promising result among a patient population with previously even more dismal outcomes 7 . Since that time, durable remission rates have increased, with other dramatic improvements in supportive care, such as antimicrobial prophylaxis and therapy, infection control, HLA tissue typing, immunosuppression, trans fusion support, and paediatric critical care management, resulting in improved patient survival.",

            "text": "In 2017, the FDA approved the first chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, tisagenlecleucel, which has been associated with ORRs of almost 90% among children and young adults with B cell precursor ALL that is treatment refractory or in second or later relapse 8, 9 . Notably, this novel genetically engineered, CD19targeted, autologous T cell immunotherapy was approved specifically for a paediatric and young adult indication. While CAR T cell immunotherapy is an exciting paradigm shift in anticancer therapy, this treatment modality is associated with unique toxicities, which can lead to very rapid and life threatening cardi orespiratory and/or neurological deterioration. Thus, this novel therapy requires the medical vigilance of a diverse multidisciplinary team -and the associated comprehensive clinical infrastructure -to ensure optimal outcomes. CAR T cells are generated through genetic modifica tion of the patient's own (autologous) T cells or those of an allogeneic donor. The isolated cells are activated and genetically modified via viral transduction or nonviral gene transfer 10, 11 . Specifically, the modified CAR T cells express an engineered chimeric cell surface receptor comprising an extracellular antigen recognition domain, which is usually an antibody single chain variable frag ment (scFv), linked to at least one intracellular signalling domain -usually the CD3\u03b6 chain of the T cell receptor plus one or more domains derived from co stimulatory receptors (such as CD28 or 41BB ligand receptor (41BB; also known as TNFRSF9)). The extracellular portion of the CAR enables recognition of a specific antigen (such as CD19), and the signalling domains stimulate T cell proliferation, cytolysis, and cytokine secretion to enable elimination of the target cell 12, 13 . Autologous or allogeneic cells genetically engineered to express CARs targeting certain molecules commonly presented on the surface of cancer cells have been asso ciated with durable remissions among patients for whom no alternative therapies were effective [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

Results from animal studies reported in May 2018 implicate recipient monocyte derived and/or macrophage derived IL1, IL6, and nitric oxide (and not CAR T cell derived cytokines) as the key determinants of the severity of CRS and CRES 34, 35 . Indeed, CRS is a systemic inflammatory response caused by the CAR T cells and involving other immune cells that is typically characterized by fever, hypoxia, tachycardia, hypotension, and multi organ dysfunction 36 . CRES can occur concurrently with CRS, following its resolution, or without associated CRS and is characterized by encephalopathy, delirium, seizures, and, rarely, cerebral oedema 37 . Almost half of all patients who receive tisagenlecleucel require intensive monitor ing and critical care support, predominantly owing to these toxicities 9, 38 . CRS and CRES are generally reversible but can be fatal. Paediatric specific management guide lines, comprehensive training of interdisciplinary staff, effective communication, and an appropriately phased infrastructure to ensure that adequate resources are available should facilitate the early diagnosis and appro priate management of paediatric patients who develop CRS and/or CRES after receiving CAR T cell therapy as a standard of care or according to a research protocoland thereby achieve optimal outcomes. Herein, we provide consensus guidelines for the use of CAR T cells in paediatric patients with cancer.",

Allogeneic CAR cells would presumably offer an 'off theshelf ' , third party approach to CAR based cell therapy [56] [57] [58] [59] . CAR transduced cord blood derived NK cells have been reported to have potent anticancer effects in preclinical studies 60 . This allogeneic NK cell approach to CAR cell therapy might also be associated with a reduced risk of GVHD compared with the use of allogeneic T cells. Moreover, the NK cell product used included a 'suicide' gene -inducible caspase 9 -that could be pharmacologically activated to eliminate the transduced cells, thus providing an additional safety mechanism 60 . A clinical trial to test the safety and effi cacy of this product is currently underway at the MD Anderson Cancer Center (NCT03056339). In other allogeneic CAR expressing cell therapy approaches, functional co expression of RQR8, a construct com bining epitopes from CD34 and CD20, renders the CAR cells sensitive to the monoclonal anti CD20 anti body rituximab, as a safety feature 56, 61 . Safety mecha nisms designed to eliminate transduced cells have also been added to autologous CAR expressing cells, such as anti CD19 CAR T cells also expressing inactive, truncated EGFR, which enables the cells to be targeted through administration of the anti EGFR antibody cetuximab 49 . The recommendations provided herein should be applicable to both autologous and allogeneic CAR based cell therapies.",

The T cell pool is subject to homeostatic regulation; there fore, a lymphopenic environment might be favourable for adoptive T cell transfer owing to reduced compe tition for homeostatic factors. Indeed, the removal of 'cytokine sinks' increases the availability of cytokines that promote lymphocyte proliferation and survival, such as IL7 and IL15, and can be a contributing fac tor to the effectiveness of tumour specific T cells [65] [66] [67] . Furthermore, the depletion of immunosuppressive CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] has been proposed as a key mechanism by which lymphodepletion augments adoptive T cell therapy 76, 77 . Accordingly, lymphodeple tion has also been shown to improve the expansion and persistence of adoptive CAR T cells and to enhance their anticancer efficacy, resulting in increased ORRs 64, 66 . Of note, the majority of paediatric patients enrolled in the trials of tisagenlecleucel completed lymphodepletion before CAR T cell infusion 9, 38 . We recommend that all patients undergo lymphodepletion if possible (omis sion of lymphodepletion might need to be considered in patients with lymphopenia).",

Both the efficacy and toxicity profiles of CAR T cell therapy might vary depending on the specific product administered and individual patient characteristics. Thus, the decision on inpatient versus outpatient management of patients treated with CAR T cell therapy should involve consid eration of the toxicity profile of the product used, the clinical status of the patient (including risk of TLS), and the ability of the institution to deliver prompt and comprehensive outpatient management, as well as the ability of the patient to access such care. Given the potential for rapid clinical deterioration, if CAR T cell therapy is administered in an outpatient setting, a low threshold should be used for patient admission upon development of fever and/or other signs or symptoms that are suggestive of CRS and/or CRES 38 (Table 1) . The presence of a reliable, consistent, and well informed caregiver is essential to facilitate outpatient adminis tration of CAR T cell therapy. In instances in which patients are not admitted for CAR T cell infusion and CRS-CRES monitoring, adequate outpatient facilities are needed, with extended outpatient hours (as defined by the institutions), prompt access to emergency and critical care, and trained staff who are knowledgea ble of CAR T cell toxicity and are capable of prompt patient evaluation and management available at all times. This requires adequate outpatient space with a design appropriate to the protection of patients who are immunocompromised while they are being triaged. Moreover, rapid access to a cellular therapy physician, and pharmacy, laboratory, and transfusion medicine services should be guaranteed.",

CRS occurred in 77% of patients, with a median time to onset of 3 days (range 1-22 days) 38 . Almost half of all patients required intensive care support, with a median stay of 7 days (range 1-34 days); intensive care support included the use of high dose vasopressors, oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation, and/or dialysis 38 . Neurological events occurred in 40% of patients, with the majority of cases occurring concurrently with, or soon after res olution of, CRS 38 . Two deaths occurred within 30 days of CAR T cell infusion (one patient died of cerebral haemorrhage and another died of progressive leukae mia) 38 . On the basis of the published experience with this product, considering inpatient admission for a minimum of 3-7 days following infusion is reasonable, especially as this treatment is increasingly being offered as a standard of care 8, 38 (Table 1) .

As mentioned previously, 77% of the paediatric and young adult population of the ELIANA trial devel oped CRS after treatment with tisagenlecleucel, with almost half experiencing severe symptoms requiring intensive care support 38 . In addition, 40% of patients developed CRES (grade 3 in 13%) 38 . Other notable adverse events included infection (in 43% of patients), cytopenias (grade \u22653 neutropenia and thrombocytope nia not resolved by day 28 in 35% and 7%, respectively), and TLS (in 4%) 38 . Patients with a high risk of develop ing severe CRS include those with early symptom onset (typically within 3 days of CAR T cell infusion), a high disease burden, and/or pre existing comorbidities 9, 20, 22 . Early detection of CRS and/or CRES in paediatric patients can be challenging; however, early diagnosis of CRS and its prompt management can mitigate the risks of life threatening sequelae. We recommend that patients who show signs of CRS and/or CRES be admit ted for observation. The grading and management of CRS have been largely based on criteria originally out lined by Lee and colleagues 29 . In the January 2018 issue of this journal, Neelapu and other members of the MD Anderson Cancer Center CARTOX Program published updated and more detailed guidelines for the manage ment of adult patients with CRS 37 . Herein, these recom mendations for adult patients have been modified with input from the PALISI Network HSCT Subgroup to provide paediatric specific guidelines.",

For children with hypoten sion owing to CRS, an initial normal saline fluid bolus (10-20 ml/kg; maximum 1,000 ml) should be adminis tered; if no improvement is observed, anti IL6 therapy should be initiated (Table 2 ). After administration of anti IL6 therapy, the decision to repeat additional fluid boluses versus starting vasopressors should involve con sideration of the cardiac and fluid status of the child. For example, the administration of additional fluid boluses should be avoided in patients with underlying cardiac dysfunction and/or signs and symptoms of volume over load (such as pulmonary oedema). Additionally, early use of colloid solutions might be indicated because patients with CRS could potentially develop capillary leak and hypoalbuminaemia more rapidly than patients with sep sis, and the administration of additional fluid boluses might compromise pulmonary function by causing pul monary oedema. Care should be taken not to trigger acute fluid overload, cardiogenic shock, and/or respiratory compromise. Consideration should be given to adrenal insufficiency in decisions of the initial choice of corti costeroid intervention, if needed (Table 2) ; patients with vasopressor resistant hypotension attributed to adrenal insufficiency might respond to stress dose hydrocorti sone only and, thus, high doses of other lymphocytotoxic corticosteroids (dexamethasone or methylprednisolone) can be avoided. Transfer to an intensive care unit should be considered early in this process (Table 1) .",

In recognition of the differences in acute res piratory distress syndrome (ARDS) between adult and paediatric patients, a 2015 publication by the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference (PALICC) group provided paediatric specific definitions for pae diatric ARDS (P ARDS) 100 ; these criteria have since been applied among paediatric patients who have under gone HSCT 101, 102 . We recommend application of the PALICC at risk P ARDS criteria for the CRS grading of hypoxia 100 (Table 1) . Accordingly, the grading of CRS related hypoxia should be based on the use of high flow oxygen and other non invasive forms of mechanical ventilation, whereby flow rates and FiO 2 are indicators of severity. For example, paediatric patients who require supplemental oxygen exceeding an FiO 2 requirement of 40% or those who are receiving non invasive mechanical ventilation should be classified as having grade 3 CRS and be managed accordingly (Table 2) . CTCAE v5.0 grading of organ toxicity provides an objective assessment tool, although high vigilance is important for prompt recognition of CRS among chil dren. Sinus tachycardia (according to age dependent definitions) is often the earliest sign of CRS 103 (Table 1) . Expected heart rate ranges should also incorporate the child's baseline measurements at patient admission before CAR T cell infusion 104 . Acute kidney injury in children can be graded according to CTCAE v5.0 criteria using the Pediatric Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End Stage Renal Disease (pRIFLE) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definitions of oliguria and anuria 105, 106 (Tables 1,2) .",

However, no adequately powered randomized studies investigating whether the administration of anti IL6 therapy and/or corticosteroids reduces the efficacy of CAR T cell ther apy have been reported to date. Notably, the use of anti IL6 therapy and/or corticosteroids for the management of CRS (usually following CAR T cell expansion) has not negatively affected disease free survival outcomes in larger cohorts 107, 108 . Indeed, the anti IL6 receptor antibody tocilizumab is currently approved by the FDA for management of CRS 109 ; patients weighing <30 kg are treated at a dose of 12 mg/kg, and those weighing \u226530 kg are treated at a dose of 8 mg/kg 110 (Tables 1,2) . Clinical responses following the administration of tocilizumab are often observed within 4 hours (ref. 33 ). Patients who do not respond to the first dose of tocilizumab might be less likely to respond to subsequent repeat admin istration of this agent; for these patients, consideration should be given to administration of corticosteroidsweighing the risks and benefits of steroid use for CRS and the uncertain risk of suppressing CAR T cell expan sion -and/or alternative agents, such as the anti IL6 monoclonal antibody siltuximab 37, 38, 111 . Corticosteroids can also be administered concurrently with repeat doses of tocilizumab (Table 2 ). When corticosteroids are used, the taper should be rapid and individualized according to the patient's response. The initial choice of corticosteroid (hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, or methylprednisolone) will vary depending on insti tutional preference, protocol specific guidelines, or product label specifications.",

Secondary HLH is thought to occur in the con text of an underlying immunological condition and, in the setting of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, is often referred to as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). The diagnosis of HLH is made on the basis of the presence of mutations associated with primary HLH (such as mutations in PRF1, UNC13D, or STX11) and/or clinical and laboratory criteria, such as fever, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridaemia, hypofibrinogenaemia, elevated serum levels of ferritin and liver enzymes, haemophago cytosis, low or absent NK cell activity, and/or elevated soluble IL2 receptor levels 113 . Differentiation of primary HLH from MAS can be difficult, and distinction of sec ondary CAR T cell related HLH-MAS from CRS-CRES can be even more challenging owing to the overlapping symptoms associated with these conditions 16, 29, 37, 112 . Future studies to define the role of genetic testing and functional analyses of NK cells might help identify patients who are at a disproportionately higher risk of this complication of CAR T cell therapy 30 . Nevertheless, diagnostic criteria for this rare toxicity have been pro vided in the guidelines for the management of adult patients treated with CAR T cell therapy published by Neelapu et al. 37 in this journal. Children can also be diagnosed with CAR T cell related HLH-MAS if they have a peak serum ferritin level >10,000 ng/ml during the CRS risk period and develop any two of the follow ing: grade \u22653 organ toxicities involving the liver, kidney, or lung; or haemophagocytosis in the bone marrow or other organs 37 . Patients who develop CAR T cell related HLH-MAS can be treated simultaneously with anti IL6 therapy and corticosteroids ( fig. 1 ); responses to anti IL6 therapy alone might not be as common as in patients with CRS alone 33 . In addition, although HLH-MAS occurring after treatment with CAR T cells and other T cell engaging therapies has typically been shown to resolve following administration of anti IL6 therapy and/or corticosteroids 30, 62, 96 , refractory cases can require additional therapy, including consideration of systemic and/or intrathecal therapy according to the HLH2004 management guidelines 113 or use of the IL1 receptor antagonist anakinra 62, 114 (Table 1 ). Further research is needed, however, to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of CAR T cell related HLH-MAS.",

The earliest signs and symp toms of CRES can be subtle among children, and, thus, a paediatric skill set is required in order to determine the child's baseline level of cognitive performance. Among adult patients, early presenting symptoms of CRES include inattention and impaired expression affecting language and handwriting 37 . Grading of CRES accord ing to CTCAE v5.0 (ref. 99 ) or previously published CRES algorithms for adult patients 29, 37 is not optimal among infants and younger children. The Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD) 116 is a validated screening tool (Supplementary Table 2 ) for recognition of delirium among children and adolescents (from birth to 21 years old); the sensitivity and specificity of this tool are highest in patients aged <12 years. Use of CAPD with appropri ate developmental anchor points 117 enables developmen tally appropriate delirium screening by nurses and other members of the health care team at the bedside and is an important tool in the overall grading of CRES, as out lined in Table 3 ; a CAPD score >8 is indicative of delir ium 116 . Alternatively, neurological assessment scoring, as previously described with the CARTOX 10point assess ment scale (CARTOX10) grading system by Neelapu et al. 37 , can be used for patients aged \u226512 years who have cognitive abilities that are appropriate for these assess ments (Table 3) . We recommend that delirium screening with CAPD or other neurological assessments be per formed at least twice per day among admitted patients and at least daily among outpatients during the high risk period for CRES (the 4 weeks after CAR T cell infusion) ( Table 1 ). The first neurological assessment from a nurs ing provider should occur at the end of their shift and be conducted concurrently with the incoming nurse. The severity of CRES can be labile; thus, assessments should be performed more frequently if a change from prior scores occurs and/or if a caregiver raises concerns.",

The use of anti IL6 therapy seems to be more effective for the management of CRES that occurs con currently with CRS. Patients who develop CRES can also benefit from early corticosteroid administration 29, 37, 38 ( Table 3 ). CRES is generally reversible; however, cer ebral oedema and death have been reported 37,64,120-122 . No adequately powered randomized studies to identify patients who are at disproportionately higher risk of CRES have been reported to date. We recommend that recipients of CAR T cell therapy with CNS disease or a history of seizures receive anti seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam (10 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 500 mg per dose) every 12 hours for 30 days following infusion (or through the CRES risk period as described during pivotal studies and with subsequent emerging data) 9,27,37 (box 1). Levetiracetam is generally well tolerated, with a minimal risk of adverse drug interactions, although dose adjustments might be necessary in the setting of renal dysfunction and are not thought to affect cytokine levels 37, 123, 124 . Neurology consultation should be consid ered if the patient develops grade 1 CRES (Table 3 ) and/ or for specialized screening for papilloedema. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of cerebral oedema. Status epilepticus can be managed according to institutional guidelines (our recommended management approaches are provided in box 4). In general, first line anti seizure medications with unfa vourable cardiotoxicity profiles (such as lacosamide and phenytoin) should be avoided when possible. Increased intracranial pressure (CSF opening pressure \u226520 mmHg or clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure) will require intensive care management and osmotherapy (a management algorithm that can be tailored accord ing to institutional guidelines is proposed in box 5). A neurosurgery consultation should be considered, and brain scans can help guide patient management. Routine chemistry panels should be monitored more frequently (every 6-8 hours) and medications adjusted accordingly to prevent rebound cerebral oedema, renal failure, hypovolemia and/or hypotension, and electro lyte abnormalities. General grading and management guidelines for CRES are outlined in Table 3 (these can be tailored according to product specific approved label instructions and/or study protocols). CRES can occur as a later complication and, in some patients, after discharge from hospital; therefore, caregivers and/or the patient should be given appropriate antici patory guidance and appropriate education before being discharged from hospital. Moreover, patients should have a caregiver available who can observe for signs of CRES and seek prompt intervention for at least 4 weeks (or through the CRES risk period) after CAR T cell infusion.",

            "text": "Financial and health-system considerations We understand that value in health care is determined by patient outcomes balanced against costs. The current estimated cost of standard of care CAR T cell therapy for children with ALL is high 136, 137 . Moreover, the ancillary administrative and supportive care service (including management of complications, intensive care unit stays, and frequent hospitalization) costs can be substantially higher than the CAR T cell product price tag 138 . We strongly encourage consideration of the quality adjusted life years gained for paediatric patients who can poten tially achieve long term remission as a result of this therapy and encourage all efforts to reduce the costs of care 137, 139, 140 (Table 1) . We anticipate that advances in CAR T cell technology will improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of CRS-CRES and facilitate the dis covery of predictive biomarkers with which to identify patients requiring early intervention with available sup portive care, which will subsequently lead to improved outcomes and reductions in the cost of this care, in addi tion to biomarkers for identifying in advance patients who are unlikely to respond. As payers and health sys tems determine coverage benefits, it is important that the specific needs of all children be considered and that access is granted to CAR T cell therapy and the asso ciated supportive care (encompassing baseline assess ments, inpatient observation, and essential supportive care when necessary). Health institutions are encouraged to provide access to CAR T cell therapies; however, adequate strategic and operational planning and preparation are needed to ensure the safe delivery of such treatments. We rec ommend that programmes seek immune effector cell (IEC) accreditation by the FACT as a voluntary means of ensuring adherence to quality standards 55 (Table 1) . FACT accreditation will require an established quality assurance programme at the institution, as well as edu cation and ongoing training for clinical staff. Institutions that offer CAR T cell therapy should support rigorous quality assurance, data management, clinical services, and education programmes for interdisciplinary staff involved in the care of patients who receive this treat ment. Additionally, emergency medical services, com munity hospitals, and local triage facilities will require high vigilance to recognize and promptly escalate care in the event that a patient treated with CAR T cell therapy presents to their facility in an emergency.",

These nurses can assist in the rapid recognition of CRS-CRES and help avoid iatrogenic errors (for example, administration of steroids as a routine pre medication). Visual cues, such as flags in the patient chart or patient bracelets (similar to 'fall risk' identifiers), can help care teams to quickly recog nize recipients of CAR T cells, even during electronic medical record 'downtime procedures' . Discharge pro tocols should ensure comprehensive education of the caregiver and patient about signs and symptoms of CRS and CRES, and the patient should also be given a wallet or REMS identification card for their spe cific CAR T cell product. Most importantly, recipients of CAR T cells should be instructed to immediately alert all providers that they have received this therapy, especially if presenting to a facility outside of their original treatment centre.",
