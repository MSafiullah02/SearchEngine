For high-containment viruses like SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1, however, these assays are not widely applicable due to the requirement for high biosafety laboratory facilities and specially trained personnel. In order to effectively address this containment issue, retroviral pseudotypes have been used as alternatives to the live virus. These pseudotypes carry the retroviral RNA genome coding for marker genes (GFP, luciferase and beta-galactosidase (b-gal) are the most frequently used). The RNA genome is packaged by retroviral core proteins, but these viral cores bear foreign, often nonretroviral envelope proteins on their surface. Pseudotype infection, i.e. transfer of their genome (containing the transfer/marker gene) to target cells, depends on the function of the foreign envelope proteins and results in integration and subsequent expression of the marker gene. The function of the foreign envelope can therefore be detected/quantified by measuring marker gene expression. Using retroviral particles pseudotyped with the envelopes of highcontainment viruses as \"surrogate viruses\" for use in neutralization assays is highly advantageous. Using a pseudotype approach, only the envelope protein(s) of the high-containment virus is required, with no possibility of recombination or virus escape. These pseudotypes undergo abortive replication and are unable to give rise to replication-competent progeny (Temperton and Wright 2009) .",

After transfection the pseudotype virus is harvested and stored at \u00c080 C until required for neutralization assays (Fig. 17 .2).

Three plasmids (gagpol module, SARS spike module and transfer/reporter module) are transfected into producer cells and the resulting mature pseudotype particles are harvested 48 and 72 h post-transfection. These particles comprise a core encasing the RNA genome, surrounded by an outer matrix protein complex, with the producer cell plasma membrane displaying the SARS-CoV S envelope proteins, forming the pseudotype virus membrane. These mature pseudotype particles can subsequently be loaded onto target cells and the level of transduction/infection measured using approprate methodologies (FACS, fluorescence microscopy, luminometry) optimal antigenic match. Pseudotype viruses bearing SARS-CoV S envelopes from many different strains have been constructed and used as surrogate viruses in cell entry and neutralization assays. Hofmann et al. have constructed HIV pseudotypes using the Frankfurt strain S protein (Hofmann et al. 2004 ). Nie et al. have constructed HIV pseudotypes using synthetic codon-optimized S proteins from the BJ01, Frankfurt, TOR2 and TW1 strains of SARS-CoV in order to screen sera from patients with SARS (Nie et al. 2004a (Nie et al. , 2004b . These four pseudotypes were normalized using a p24 ELISA assay. Assays were performed using human hepatoma Huh7 cells that endogenously express high levels of ACE2 receptor. Han et al. have constructed MLV pseudotypes using the Urbani strain S protein for the development of a safe neutralization assay for SARS-CoV ). Temperton et al. have constructed MLV and HIV pseudotypes using the Urbani strain S protein in order to profile neutralizing antibody responses to the S glycoprotein in sequential serum samples collected from recovered patients (Temperton et al. 2005) . Assays were performed on quail QT6 cells stably over-expressing the ACE2 receptor. The FFM-1 strain of SARS was used by Giroglou et al. to construct MLV pseudotypes (Giroglou et al. 2004 ). Zhang et al. have constructed HIV pseudotypes using the HK-39 strain S protein to study neutralizing antibody responses in SARS-CoV infected patients. For these assays, a HEK293 cell line transduced with the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 (293/ACE2) was used. Zhu et al. have used HIV pseudotypes bearing the S proteins from the TOR2, Urbani, GD03, SZ3 and SZ16 strains of SARS-CoV to study the in vitro neutralizing activity of human monoclonal antibodies (Zhu et al. 2007 ). Thus, to date at least ten different SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins have been incorporated successfully into retroviral pseudotypes and employed for a multitude of cell tropism and antibody assays.",

Upon availability of viral RNA/cDNA or sequence information of the newly emergent SARS virus (from public nucleotide sequence databases such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information database held at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), the spike gene can be PCR-amplified or synthesized and retroviral pseudotypes prepared for use in downstream neutralization assays. With the cost of whole gene synthesis decreasing year on year, this is a viable proposition for the development of such serological assays, as access to the wild-type virus is often severely limited to a small group of laboratories (WHO, CDC, HPA etc.). These newly developed assays can be used to address the cross-clade neutralizing potential of candidate human vaccines and immuno-therapeutics (monoclonal antibodies etc.). They can also been used for the evaluation of anti-S virus entry inhibitors and could readily be adapted for serosurveillance studies in new outbreak locations.",

            "text": "When measuring neutralizing antibody responses against antigenically diverse SARS-CoV strains, it is necessary to accurately titre the pseudotype viruses so that virus input doses may be normalized. GFP-based pseudotypes are readily titred using flow cytometry (FACS), luciferase pseudotypes by luminometry and b-gal pseudotypes by colour reaction. The titres obtained by these methods are highly dependent on the cell type chosen for the assay, as ACE2 receptor density may differ widely between cell types. Many cell lines have been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV (Hattermann et al. 2005; Kaye 2006 ). These cell lines have been previously employed, or are predicted to be suitable target cells for use in pseudotype assays. They are BGM (buffalo green monkey kidney epithelium), COS (monkey kidney fibroblast), CV-1 (African green monkey kidney fibroblast), FRhK (rhesus monkey fetal kidney), LLC-Mk2 (rhesus monkey kidney epithelium), MA-104 (African green monkey kidney epithelium), MEK (monkey embryonic kidney), Vero (African green monkey kidney epithelium), Vero E6 (clone of Vero), HEK293 (human fetal kidney), HepG2 (human liver hepatocellular carcinoma), Huh-7 (human liver hepatocellular carconoma), Hep2 (human liver), RK-13 (rabbit kidney epithelium), POEK (porcine fetal kidney) and PS (porcine kidney).",

These are firefly luciferase Wright et al. 2008) , renilla luciferase ) and b-gal. Of the three assay types, those based on luciferase reporter are the simplest to use in terms of operator time and data evaluation. However, due to the high cost of the necessary reagents (luciferase assay kits) and necessity for specialized equipment (luminometer), these assays may have limited applicability for laboratories in resource-poor regions. GFP and other fluorescence protein-based assays (RFP, YFP) do not require any additional assay reagents but do necessitate the availability of specialized equipment (fluorescence microscope with interchangeable colour filters, or a 96-well plate flow cytometry/FACS facility). The b-gal-based assays are the most cost-effective, as the required assay reagents are readily available at low cost, and specialized equipment is unnecessary.",

Temperton et al. showed correlation data for neutralizing antibody titres measured by plaque reduction assay versus titres measured with a pseudotype assay Fig. 17.3 Reporter gene readout for SARS-CoV (S) pseudotype neutralization assays. The detection of pseudotype transduction for the quantification of neutralizing antibody responses against the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein depends on the reporter/ transfer gene incorporated into the mature particle. Options available include GFP, luciferase and b-gal. ONPG: o-nitrophenyl-b-Dgalactopyranoside; CPRG: chlorophenol red-b-Dgalactopyranoside at both 50% and 90% inhibition of virus entry end-points. Correlation coefficients for live virus versus 50% and 90% pseudovirus inhibition were 0.78 and 0.69 respectively (Temperton et al. 2005 ). Zhang et al. studied temporal changes in N protein-specific (by quantitative ELISA) and S glycoprotein-specific neutralizing antibody responses (by SARS-CoV pseudotype assay) in infected patients who had either recovered from or succumbed to SARS-CoV infection (Zhang et al. 2006) . A good correlation between strong antibody responses to N and S proteins and disease outcome of infected individuals was shown. In a large comprehensive study on 128 SARS convalescent patient sera, strong T-cell responses were shown to correlate significantly (p <0.05) with higher neutralizing antibody titer as measured by an MLV(SARS) assay (Li et al. 2008 ).",
