This both 156 protects individuals from reinfection and limits the spread of infection in a community. Immune 157 memory can be very long-lasting; immunological memory for the measles infection in adults decays so 158 slowly, it would take over 3,000 years to decrease by half. This therefore goes well beyond life-long 159 protection for this particular antigen. These robust durable changes are the reason that, when we 160 vaccinate, the protection this produces delivers long-term benefits. Within an individual, immune 161 memory must be distributed throughout the body.

IgG binds antigen and drives the recognition of antigen-antibody 183 complexes by leukocytes and macrophages. IgG is transferred to the fetus through the placenta and 184protects the infant until its own immune system is functional. IgG is largely responsible for long term 185 immunity after infection or vaccination. 186IgM 187IgM usually circulates in the blood, accounting for about 10% of human immunoglobulins. IgM generally 188 has a pentameric structure in which five basic Y-shaped molecules are linked together. B cells produce 189IgM first in response to microbial infection/antigen invasion. These are early phase immunoglobulins 190 that will develop first during acute infection. Although IgM has a lower affinity for antigens than IgG, it 191 has higher avidity for antigens because of its pentameric structure. IgM, by binding to the cell surface 192receptor, also activates cell signaling pathways. 193IgA 194IgA is abundant in serum, nasal mucus, saliva, breast milk, and intestinal fluid, accounting for 10 to 15% 195 of human immunoglobulins. IgA forms dimers (i.e. two IgA monomers joined together). 196IgE 197IgE is present in minute amounts, accounting for no more than 0.001% of human immunoglobulins. Its 198 primary role is to protect against parasites. In regions where parasitic infection is rare, IgE is primarily 199 involved in allergy. 200IgD 201IgD accounts for less than 1% of human immunoglobulins. IgD may be involved in the induction of 202 antibody production in B cells, but its exact function remains unknown. 203Molecular test methods are considered the only reliable means of diagnosing an active case of 19, particularly early in the infection course, and is the only means of determining if a patient is 208 contagious to others. By detecting the presence of viral genetic material in the nasal, oral and 209 respiratory tracts one can determine if a patient is actively shedding virus which can be spread to others. 210These tests are perhaps of greatest utility early in the course of infection as they can confirm viral 211 presence up to 2 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Given that antibodies may not be detectable 212 until 6-7 days after symptom onset, molecular tests can accelerate the diagnostic window by up to 9 213 days. The duration of viral shedding can be highly variable and depend upon severity of symptoms, 214length of illness and patient-specific immune response.Therefore, there is a clear role for antibody testing as an important tool in the diagnostic toolbox for 224 COVID-19. Antibody testing can provide important insight to individuals about their functional immunity 225to the ongoing pandemic, giving piece of mind and assisting with decisions about return to community 226 activities and the workplace. These tests also provide valuable information to public health officials 227 about the spread of virus in different communities, especially in light of the high reported numbers of 228 asymptomatic cases. Furthermore, while never a primary diagnostic tool, antibody status can be used to 229aid the clinical diagnosis of suspected non-critical cases that present 7 days or more after the start of",

Ten became infected, and eight developed 424 cold symptoms. One year later, all but one of them returned to be re-infected again. The majority were 425 re-infected, but those who had been ill before did not develop cold symptoms. Moreover, the period 426 during which the patients shed the virus, and were potentially contagious, was shorter. The new virus, 427 SARS-CoV-2, is genetically similar to the first SARS virus -hence the \"2\" -but it affects people 428 differently. It is not as lethal as the original SARS but is more easily spread (R O is higher) (Liu, Gayle, 429 Wilder-Smith, & Rockl\u00f6v, 2020). Many people who are infected do not develop symptoms at all and yet 430 can potentially transmit the virus to others. 431 432 A very recent report from China that has not yet been peer-reviewed found a wide range of antibodies 433 among people with mild cases of the virus. Most strikingly, younger people had fewer antibodies in the 434 wake of the disease -and 30 percent of those sampled had low levels. Some individuals had no trace of 435 antibodies. That has raised the question of whether a person with a mild or asymptomatic infection, but 436 confirmed by the sensitive PCR test, might still be susceptible to a second infection.
