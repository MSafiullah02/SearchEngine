During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, unprecedented numbers of patients require sedation in intensive care units (ICUs) and other hospital locations due to their ventilator dependence. However, pharmacologic sedation in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 has thus far received very little attention in the critical care literature, with minimal mention in the Society of Critical Care Medicine's COVID-19 guidelines or clinical reviews. 1, 2 We propose that sedation of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 poses unique challenges and has multiple important implications that we would like to briefly outline:",

These high sedation requirements are likely related to younger age and good health of many patients before the onset of COVID-19, high respiratory drive, and intense inflammatory responses previously linked to tolerance. 3 This translates into the need to administer combinations of multiple agents (eg, propofol, ketamine, hydromorphone, dexmedetomidine, and midazolam), increasing potential risks of side effects (eg, QT interval prolongation, hypertriglyceridemia, hypotension, and delirium) and requiring vigilance of the ICU staff. When these are administered in combinations, the typical requirements to ensure patient comfort and ventilator synchrony in adult patients range between 25 and 50 \u00b5g/kg/min for propofol, 10 and 20 \u00b5g/kg/min for ketamine, 2 and 4 mg/h for hydromorphone, and 2 and 5 mg/h for midazolam. There are currently no sedation guidelines specific for this patient population requiring high doses and prolonged drug administrations.",

The use of inhalational anesthetics (eg, isoflurane), at least in locations with appropriately designed scavenging systems, such as operating rooms converted to ICUs, may be a rational alternative that is also supported by anti-inflammatory and lung-protective effects of inhalational anesthetics. 6 Attention must be paid to the potential interaction between sedative drugs and other agents administered as part of clinical trials (there are >300 clinical COVID-19 trials currently ongoing worldwide). For instance, significant QT prolongations may result from combinations of hydroxychloroquine and haloperidol. Administration of barbiturates may increase metabolism of hydroxychloroquine. In patients with high fevers, dexmedetomidine may need to be discontinued to help delineate the cause of the fever.",
