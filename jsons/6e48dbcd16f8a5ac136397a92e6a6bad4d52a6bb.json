In this graph, vertices identify individuals and edges establish the existence of some type of relations between them. In real communities, the possible edges may be active or not for variable periods of time. These so-called temporal networks typically result from an endogenous social dynamics, usually coupled to the process under study taking place in the community. For instance, disease spreading may be affected by local information that makes individuals aware of the health status of their social contacts, allowing them to reconsider maintaining or not their social contacts. Here we investigate the impact of such a dynamical network structure on disease dynamics, where infection occurs along the edges of the network. To this end, we define an endogenous network dynamics coupled with disease spreading. We show that the effective infectiousness of a disease taking place along the edges of this temporal network depends on the population size, the number of infected individuals in the population and the capacity of healthy individuals to sever contacts with the infected, ultimately dictated by availability of information regarding each individual's health status. Importantly, we also show how dynamical networks strongly decrease the average time required to eradicate a disease.",

            "text": "Understanding disease spreading and evolution involves overcoming a multitude of complex, multi-scale challenges of mathematical and biological nature [1, 2] . Traditionally, the contact process between an infected individual and the susceptible ones was assumed to affect equally any susceptible in a population (mean-field approximation, well-mixed population approximation) or, alternatively, all those susceptible living in the physical neighborhood of the infected individual (spatial transmission). During recent years, however, it has become clear that disease spreading [2] [3] [4] [5] transcends geography: the contact process is no longer restricted to the immediate geographical neighbors, but exhibits the stereotypical small-world phenomenon [6] [7] [8] [9] , as testified by recent global pandemics (together with the impressive amount of research that has been carried out to investigate them) or, equally revealing, the dynamics associated with the spreading of computer viruses [5, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Recent advances in the science of networks [3, 4, 19, 24, 25] also provided compelling evidence of the role that the networks of contacts between individuals or computers play in the dynamics of infectious diseases [4, 7] . In the majority of cases in which complex networks of disease spreading have been considered [9] , they were taken to be a single, static entity. However, contact networks are intrinsically temporal entities and, in general, one expects the contact process to proceed along the lines of several networks simultaneously [11, 13-16, 18, 23, 24, 26-36] . In fact, modern societies have developed rapid means of information dissemination, both at local and at centralized levels, which one naturally expects to alter individuals' response to vaccination policies, their behavior with respect to other individuals and their perception of likelihood and risk of infection [37] . In some cases one may even witness the adoption of centralized measures, such as travel restrictions [38, 39] or the imposition of quarantine spanning parts of the population [40] , which may induce abrupt dynamical features onto the structure of the contact networks. In other cases, social media can play a determinant role in defining the contact network, providing crucial information on the dynamical patterns of disease spreading [41] . Furthermore, the knowledge an individual has (based on local and/or social media information) about the health status of acquaintances, partners, relatives, etc., combined with individual preventive strategies [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] (such as condoms, vaccination, the use of face masks or prophylactic drugs, avoidance of visiting specific web-pages, staying away from public places, etc.), also leads to changes in the structure and shape of the contact networks that naturally acquire a temporal dimension that one should not overlook.",

Or even to an evanescence of their values whenever one models the contact network as a (static and infinite) scale-free network, such that the variance of the network degree distribution becomes arbitrarily large? Or will the temporal nature of the contact network lead to new dynamical features? And, if so, which features will emerge from the inclusion of this temporal dimension?",

            "text": "To answer this question computationally constitutes, in general, a formidable challenge. We shall attempt to address the problem analytically, and to this end some simplifications will be required. However, the simplifications we shall introduce become plausible taking into consideration recent results (i) in the evolutionary dynamics of social dilemmas of cooperation, (ii) in the dynamics of peer-influence, and even (iii) in the investigation of how individual behavior determines and is determined by the global, population wide behavior. All these recent studies point out to the fact that the impact of temporal networks in the population dynamics stems mostly from the temporal part itself, and not so much from the detailed shape and structure of the network [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] . Indeed, we now know that (i) different models of adaptive network dynamics lead to similar qualitative features regarding their impact in what concerns the evolution of cooperation [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] , (ii) the degree of peer-influence is robust to the structural patterns associated with the underlying social networks [62] , and (iii) the impact of temporal networks in connecting individual to collective behavior in the evolution of cooperation is very robust and related to a problem of N-body coordination [61, 63] . Altogether, these features justify that we model the temporal nature of the contact network in terms of a simple, adaptive network, the dynamics of which can be approximately described in terms a coupled system of ODEs. This \"adaptive-linking\" dynamics, as it was coined [28, [57] [58] [59] , leads to network snapshot structures that do not replicate what one observes in real-life, in the same sense that the small-world model of Watts and Strogatz does not lead to the heterogeneous and diverse patterns observed in data snapshots of social networks. Notwithstanding, the active-linking dynamics allows us to include, analytically, the temporal dimension into the problem of disease dynamics. The results [28] , as we elaborate in Sects. 3 and 4, prove rewarding, showing that the temporal dimension of a contact network leads to a shift of the critical parameters (defined below) which is no longer rigid but, instead, becomes dependent on the frequency of infected individuals in the population. This, we believe, constitutes a very strong message with a profound impact whenever one tries to incorporate the temporal dimension into computational models of disease forecast.",

We investigate the popular Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model [2, 4] , the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model [2] used to study, e.g., AIDS [2, 64] , and the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model [2, 65] , more appropriate to model, for instance, single season flu outbreaks [2] or computer virus spreading [7] . It is also worth pointing out that variations of these models have been used to successfully model virus dynamics and the interplay between virus dynamics and the response of the immune system [66] .",

The value of R 0 determines the stability of these two equilibria: x D 1 R 1 0 is stable when R 0 > 1 and unstable when R 0 < 1. Let us now move to finite populations, and consider the well-mixed case where the population size is fixed and equal to N. We define a discrete stochastic Markov process describing the disease dynamics associated with the SIS model. Each configuration of the population, which is defined by the number of infected individuals i, corresponds to one state of the Markov chain. Time evolves in discrete steps and two types of events may occur which change the composition of the population: infection events and recovery events. This means that, similar to computer simulations of the SIS model on networked populations, at most one infection or recovery event will take place in each (discrete) time step. Thus, the dynamics can be represented as a Markov chain M with NC1 states [67, 68] -as many as the number of possible configurations -illustrated in the following Fig. 13 .1.",

This makes the so-called quasi-stationary distribution of M [70] the quantity of interest. This quantity allows us to estimate the relative prevalence of the population in configurations other than the absorbing state, by computing the stationary distribution of the Markov chain obtained from M by excluding the absorbing state iD0 [70] .

Its temporal contact structure allows, however, for a variable number of overall links between individuals, which in turn will depend on the incidence of disease in the population. This way, infection proceeds along the links of a contact network whose structure may change based on each individual's health status and the availability of information regarding the health status of others. We shall assume the existence of some form of local information about the health status of social contacts. Information is local, in the sense that individual behavior will rely on the nature of their links in the contact network. Moreover, this will influence the way in which individuals may be more or less effective in avoiding contact with those infected while remaining in touch with the healthy. Suppose all individuals seek to establish links at the same rate c. For simplicity, we assume that new links are established and removed randomly, a feature which usually does not always apply in real cases, where the limited social horizon of individuals or the nature of their social ties may constrain part of their neighborhood structure (see below). Let us further assume that links may be broken off at different rates, based on the nature of the links and the information available about the individuals they connect: Let us denote these rates by b pq for links of type pq (p , q 2 fS, I, Rg. We assume that links are bidirectional, which means that we have links of pq types SI, SR, and IR. Let L pq denote the number of links of type pq and L M pq the maximum possible number of links of that type, given the number of individuals of type S, I and R in the population. This allows us to write down (at a mean-field level) a system of ODEs [57, 58] for the time evolution of the number of links of pq-type (L pq ) [57, 58] ",

In the absence of disease only SS links exist, and hence SS determines the average connectivity of the network under disease free conditions, which one can use to characterize the type of the population under study. In the presence of I individuals, to the extent that S individuals manage to avoid contact with I, they succeed in escaping infection. Thus, to the extent that individuals are capable of reshaping the contact network based on available information of the health status of other individuals, disease progression will be inhibited. In the extreme limit of perfect information and individual capacity to immediately break up contacts with infected, we are isolating all infected, and as such containing disease progression. Our goal here, however, is to understand how and in which way local information, leading to a temporal reshaping of the network structure, affects overall disease dynamics.",

All individual-based simulations start from a complete network of size ND100. Disease spreading and network evolution proceed together under asynchronous updating. Disease update events take place with probability (1 C ) 1 , where D NET / DIS . We define DIS as the time-scale of disease progression, whereas NET is the time scale of network change. The parameter D NET / DIS provides the relative time scale in terms of which we may interpolate between the limits when network adaptation is much slower than disease progression ( ! 0) and the opposite limit when network adaptation is much faster than disease progression ( ! 1). Since D NET / DIS is the only relevant parameter, we can make, without loss of generality, DIS D 1. For network update events, we randomly draw two nodes from the population. If connected, then the link disappears with probability given by the respective b pq . Otherwise, a new link appears with probability c. When a disease update event occurs, a recovery event takes place with probability (1 C hki) 1 , an infection event otherwise. In both cases, an individual j is drawn randomly from the population. If j is infected and a recovery event has been selected then j will become susceptible (or recovered, model dependent) with probability \u2022. If j is susceptible and an infection event occurs, then j will get infected with probability oe if a randomly chosen neighbor of j is infected. The quasi-stationary distributions are computed (in the case of the SIS model) as the fraction of time the population spends in each configuration (i.e., number of infected individuals) during 10 9 disease event updates (10 7 generations; under asynchronous updating, one generation corresponds to N update events, where N is the population size; this means that in one generation, every individual has one chance, on average, to update her epidemic state). The average number of infected hIi and the mean average degree of the network hki observed during these 10 7 generations are kept for further plotting. We have checked that the results reported are independent of the initial number of infected in the network. Finally, for the SIR and SI models, the disease progression in time, shown in the following sections, is calculated from 10 4 independent simulations, each simulation starting with 1 infected individual. The reported results correspond to the average amount of time at which i individuals become infected.",

In the present study, individual decision is based on available local information about the health state of one's contacts. Thus, we can study analytically the limit in which the network dynamics -resulting from adaptation to the flow of local information -is much faster than disease dynamics, as in this case, one may separate the time scales between network adaptation and contact (disease) dynamics: The network has time to reach a steady state before the next contact takes place. Consequently, the probability of having an infected neighbor is modified by a neighborhood structure which will change in time depending on the impact of the disease in the population and the overall rates of severing links with infected. Let us start with the SIR model. The amount of information available translates into differences mostly between the break-up rates of links that may involve a potential risk for further infection (b SI , b IR , b II ), and those that do not (b SS , b SR , b RR ). Therefore, we consider one particular rate b I for links involving infected individuals (b I \u00c1 b SI D b IR D b II ), and another one, b H , for links connecting healthy",

Note that we reduce the model to two break-up rates in order to facilitate the discussion of the results. Numerical simulations show that the general principles and conclusions remain valid when all break-up rates are incorporated explicitly. It is worth noticing that three out of these six rates are of particular importance for the overall disease dynamics: b SS , b SR and b SI . These three rates, combined with the rate c of creating new links, define the fraction of active SS, SR and SI links, and subsequent correlations between individuals [76] , and therefore determine the probability for a susceptible to become infected (see Models and Methods). This probability will increase when considering higher values of c (assuming b I > b H ). In other words, when individuals create new links more often, therefore increasing the likelihood of establishing connections to infected individuals (when present), they need to be better informed about the health state of their contacts in order to escape infection. In the fast linking limit, the other three break-up rates (b II , b IR and b RR ) will also influence disease progression since they contribute to changing the average degree of the network.",

Strictly speaking, a dynamical network does not change the disease dynamics at the local level, meaning that infected individuals pass the disease to their neighbors with probability intrinsic to the disease itself. At the population level, on the other hand, disease progression proceeds as if the infectiousness of the disease effectively changes, as a result of the network dynamics. Consequently, analyzing a temporal network scenario at a population level can be achieved via a renormalization of the transmission probability, keeping the (mathematically more attractive) well-mixed scenario. In this sense, from a well-mixed perspective, dynamical networks contribute to changing the effective infectiousness of the disease, which becomes frequency and information dependent. Note further that this information dependence is a consequence of using a single temporal network for spreading the disease and information. Interestingly, adaptive networks have been shown to have a similar impact in social dilemmas [63] . From a global, population-wide perspective, it is as if the social dilemma at stake differs from the one every individual actually plays.",

We start with a complete network of size N, in which initially one individual is infected, the rest being susceptible. As stated before, disease spreading and network evolution proceed simultaneously under asynchronous updating. Network update events take place with probability (1 C ) 1 , whereas a disease model (SI, SIS or SIR) state update event occurs otherwise. For each value of , we run 10 4 simulations. For the SI model, the quantity of interest to calculate is the average number of generations after which the population becomes completely infected. These values are depicted in Fig. 13 .5. The lower dashed line indicates the analytical prediction of the infection time in the limit ! 1 (the limit when networks remain static), which we already recover in the simulations for > 10 2 . When is smaller than 10 2 , the average infection time significantly increases, and already reaches the analytical prediction for the limit ! 0 (indicated by the upper dashed line) when < 1.

(13.17) and (13.18) . One observes that linking dynamics does not affect disease dynamics for > 10. Once drops below ten, a significantly smaller fraction of individuals is affected by the disease. This fraction reaches the analytical prediction for ! 0 as soon as < 0.1. Hence, and again, results obtained via separation of time scales remain valid for a wide range of intermediate time scales. We finally investigate the role of intermediate time scales in the SIS model. We performed computer simulations in the conditions discussed already, and computed several quantities that we plot in Fig. 13.7 . Figure 13 .7 shows the average hIi of the quasi-stationary distributions obtained via computer simulations (circles) as a function of the relative time scale of network update. Whenever ! 1, we can characterize the disease dynamics analytically, assuming a well-mixed population (complete graph), whereas for ! 0 we recover the analytical results obtained in the fast linking limit. At intermediate time scales, Fig. 13 .7 shows that as long as is smaller than ten, network dynamics contributes to inhibit disease spreading by effectively increasing the critical infection rate. Overall, the validity of the time scale separation extends well beyond the limits one might anticipate based solely on the time separation ansatz. As long as the time scale for network update is smaller than the one for disease spreading ( < 1), the analytical prediction for the limit ! 0, indicated by the lower dashed line in Fig. 13.7 , remains valid. The analytical result in the extreme opposite limit ( ! 1), indicated by the upper dashed line in Fig. 13 .7, holds as long as > 10 5 . Moreover, it is noteworthy that the network dynamics influences the disease dynamics both by reducing the frequency of interactions between susceptible and infected, and by reducing the average degree of the network. These complementary effects are disentangled in intermediate regimes, in which the network dynamics is too slow to warrant sustained protection of susceptible individuals from contacts with infected, despite managing to reduce the average degree (not shown). In fact, for > 10 the disease dynamics is mostly controlled by the average degree, as shown by the solid lines in Fig. 13.7 . Here, the average stationary distribution was determined by replacing, in the analytic expression for static networks, hki by the time-dependent average connectivity hki computed numerically. This, in turn, results from the frequency dependence of hki. When b I > b H , the network will reshape into a configuration with smaller hki as soon as the disease expansion occurs. For < 1, hki reflects the lifetime of SS links, as there are hardly any infected in the population. For 10 0 < < 10 3 , the network dynamics proceeds fast enough to reduce hki, but too slowly to reach its full potential in hindering disease progression. Given the higher fraction of infected, and the fact that SI and II links have a shorter lifetime than SS links, the average degree drops when increasing from 1 to 10 3 . Any further increase in leads to a higher average degree, as the network approaches its static limit. ",

When information prevails, susceptible individuals manage to resist infection for a long time, thereby delaying the rapid progression of the disease, as shown in the inset of Fig. 13.10 . Naturally, the average number of generations needed to reach a fully infected population increases with the availability of information, as illustrated in the main panel of Fig. 13.10 . ",

We argue, however, that the differences obtained stem mostly from the temporal aspect of the network, and not so much from the detailed dynamics that is implemented. Importantly, temporal network dynamics leads to additional changes in R 0 compared to those already obtained when moving from the well-mixed assumption to static networks [77] . An important ingredient of our model, however, is that the average degree of the network results from the selforganization of the network structure, and co-evolves with the disease dynamics. A population suffering from high disease prevalence where individuals avoid contact in order to escape infection will therefore exhibit a lower average degree than a population with hardly any infected individuals. Such a frequency-dependent average degree further prevents that containment of infected individuals would result in the formation of cliques of susceptible individuals, which are extremely vulnerable to future infection, as reported before [36, 51, 54] .",

This approach allows for a direct comparison between analytical predictions and individual-based computer simulations, and for a detailed analysis of finite-size effects and convergence times, whose exponential growth will signal possible bistable disease scenarios. In such a framework, we were able to show that temporal adaptive networks in which individuals may be informed about the health status of others lead to a disease whose effective infectiousness depends on the overall number of infected in the population. In other words, disease propagation on temporal adaptive networks can be seen as mathematically equivalent to disease spreading on a well-mixed population, but with a rescaled effective infectiousness. In accord with the intuition advanced in the introduction, as long as individuals react promptly and consistently to accurate available information on whether their acquaintances are infected or not, network dynamics effectively weakens the disease burden the population suffers. Last but not least, if recovery from the disease is possible, the time for disease eradication drastically reduces whenever individuals have access to accurate information about the health state of their acquaintances and use it to avoid contact with those infected. If recovery or immunity is impossible, the average time needed for a disease to spread increases significantly when such information is being used. In both cases, our model clearly shows how availability of information hinders disease progression (by means of quick action on infected, e.g., their containment via link removal), which constitutes a crucial factor to control the development of global pandemics.",

This is for instance the case for diseases where recently infected individuals remain asymptomatic for a substantial period. The longer the incubation period associated with the disease, the less successful individuals will be in escaping infection, which in our model translates into a lower effective rate of breaking SI links, with the above mentioned consequences. Moreover, different (social) networks through which awareness of the health status of others proceeds may lead to different rates of information spread. One may take these features into account by modeling explicitly the spread of information through a coupled dynamics between disease expansion and individuals' awareness of the disease [31, 33] .",

The impact of combining such effects, resulting from specific disease scenarios, with those reported here will depend on the prevalence of such additional effects when compared to linkrewiring dynamics. A small fraction of non-random links, or of ties which cannot be broken, will likely induce small modifications on the average connectivity of the contact network, which can be incorporated in our analytic expressions without compromising their validity regarding population wide dynamics. On the other hand, when the contact network is highly heterogeneous (e.g., exhibiting pervasive long-tail degree distributions), non-random events may have very distinct effects, from being almost irrelevant (and hence can be ignored) to inducing hierarchical cascades of infection [81] , in which case our results will not apply.",
