            "text": "In the globalized world, there is growing concern about economic growth and economy. Development of technologies and use of ICT brings a lot of benefits to society, economy, citizens, companies, cities and next stakeholders. A lot of people use advanced technologies in their daily lives. Technologies are not used only by citizens, companies, but also by governance and cities. The phenomenon of Smart Cities has been experiencing a rising interest in the academic sphere in recent years. The first article on Smart Cities that appeared in the Web of Science database was 'Smart cities -The Singapore case' by Mahizhnan [4] . With 81 citations it is nowadays one of the most cited article on selected topic. Graham and Aurigi [2, 3] appeared in 1997 the concept of a smart city. The possibility of using ICT tools for communicating with residents was one of the impulse. Next one was collecting data or using this data to manage the city. To state one universal definition of the concept of a smart city is difficult. The report entitled Smart Cities-Ranking of European Medium-Sized Cities [5] defined the idea of 'smart city' quite broadly. According to report \"smart city is a city well performing in a forwardlooking way in six characteristics [economy, people, governance, mobility, environment, and living], built on the smart combination of endowments and activities of selfdecisive, independent and aware citizen\". Caragliu et al. [6] defines smart city with the conditions \"when investments in human and social capital and traditional (transport) and modern (ICT) communication infrastructure fuel sustainable economic growth and a high quality of life, with a wise management of natural resources, through participatory governance.\"",

Six basic directions for action will enable it to direct its objectives along this route, according to the definition of smart cities given by Boyd Cohen Steps of the research are as follows. Firstly, there is the introduction to the topic. The methodological background brings the aim and goal of the study, description of the study procedure and used sources. The literature review contains basic definitions and the starting points to selected issues. The next phase deals with results from bibliographic coupling and co-occurrence of selected keywords. The final phase focuses on summarization and discussion of findings gained from the research. The aim of the paper is to map and analyse the state of usage of current topics and terms \"SMART city\" and \"economy\" and their bibliographic coupling and cooccurrence on Web of Science. Focus will be given on documents and their citation, use of journals for publishing of articles, authors that have the most articles and number of published documents in countries. In co-occurrence will be analysed the most often used keywords in the articles. The previous studies basically focus only on a certain perspective. Visual bibliometric analysis on connected topics smart cities and economy was not founded. This study employed scoping review techniques to dissect the status quo for SMART city and economy. Our search of scientific and research sources focused on scientific sources. The bibliometric mapping study method by Leung et al. [32] and scoping review technique by Arksey and O'Malley [33] were adopted in this review-based article.",

According to above mentioned words and done analysis is Smart city also often connected with keywords technology, urbanization, growth, sharing economy, future, model, politics, sustainability, urban governance, internet of things and open innovation. The creation of smart cities is a motivator for growth, new jobs and is a productive investment in future, leading to a sustainable and environmentally friendly economy. Well-arranged pictures presented in this paper demonstrate the research achievements in the domain of the smart city and economy, which could help researchers, practitioners and mayors and politics to identify the underlying impacts from authors, journals, countries, institutions, references, and research topics.",
