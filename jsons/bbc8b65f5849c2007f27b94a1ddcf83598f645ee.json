The SARS-CoV-2 represents a potential epidemic or pandemic threat, which requires a quick response for preparedness against this infection. The present report uses the informational spectrum methodology to identify the possible origin and natural host of the new virus, as well as putative therapeutic and vaccine targets. The performed analysis in silico indicates that the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and, to a lesser degree, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. Moreover, the well-known SARS-CoV receptor (ACE2) might be a putative receptor for the novel virus as well. Actin protein was also suggested as a host factor that participates in cell entry and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, drugs modulating biological activity of this protein (e.g. ibuprofen) were suggested as potential candidates for treatment of this viral infection. Additional results indicated that civets and poultry are potential candidates for the natural reservoir of the SARS-CoV-2, and that domain 288-330 of S1 protein from the SARS-CoV-2 represents promising therapeutic and/or vaccine target.",

The newly emerging pathogen belongs to the same virus family as the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively). The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently published surveillance recommendations for a possible \"large epidemic or even pandemic\" (pandemic declared on March 11 th , 2020) of the novel coronavirus and it has issued guidelines for hospitals across the world. However, many questions about SARS-CoV-2 remain unanswered: (i) what is the origin and/or natural reservoir of the virus? (ii) is it easily transmitted from human to human? and (iii) what are the potential diagnostic, therapeutic and vaccine targets? Currently, only nucleotide sequences of eight human SARS-CoV-2 isolates are available without any additional information about biological properties of the virus, beyond the morphological confirmation of the virion using electronic microscopy. This is likely not enough information to answer the important abovementioned questions.",

According to this approach, sequences (protein or DNA) are transformed into signals by assignment of numerical values of each element (amino acid or nucleotide). These values correspond to electron-ion interaction potential 6 , determining electronic properties of amino acid/nucleotides, which are essential for their intermolecular interactions. The signal obtained is then decomposed in a periodical function by the Fourier transformation. The result is a series of frequencies and their amplitudes. The obtained frequencies correspond to the distribution of structural motifs (primary structure) with defined physico-chemical characteristics responsible for the biological function of the putative protein corresponding to the analyzed sequence. When comparing proteins that share same biological or biochemical function, the technique allows detection of code/frequency pairs that are specific for their common biological properties. The method is insensitive to the location of the motifs and, therefore, does not require previous alignment of the sequences.

Calculation of the CS for S1 protein from the SARS-CoV-2 and all ACE2 sequences available at the UniProt database revealed that the highest amplitudes on the frequency F(0.257) correspond to ACE2 from civet and chicken. This result indicates that these species can be included as potential candidates for the natural reservoir of the SARS-CoV-2.

Actin was also found to be the primary component by which ibuprofen can bind to the tissue in different organs 18 . This suggests that ibuprofen might impact the SARS-CoV-2-induced disease by indirect interaction with actin proteins. Previously, ibuprofen was predicted as a candidate entry inhibitor for Ebola virus using the same in silico approach 19 , and this prediction was confirmed experimentally at a later time point 20,21 . These results prompt the possibility to experimentally test the effects of ibuprofen on SARS-CoV-2 infection under in vitro and in vivo conditions.",

Further research on these issues are needed, including the development of reverse genetics and animal models to study the biology of SARS-CoV-2. Due to the fast evolving of scientific knowledge on SARS-CoV-2, the first prediction has been already confirmed, while the chicken as potential candidate as intermediate host has not been supported. Importantly, link between ibuprofen/actin interactions and viral entry remains an exciting path for future therapeutic investigations.",

The authors use the Informational Spectrum Method (ISM), a virtual spectroscopy method for protein analysis based on the electronic properties of each amino acid. Their goal is to identify sites on the virus most likely to interact with other molecules like drugs, antibodies or viral receptors.Due to the rapidity of this field and the time elapsed since the manuscript was submitted (Jan 27), most of their conclusions are no longer new: nCoV is most related to SARS-CoV and less to MERS-CoV, ACE2 is a likely receptor, the natural reservoir might be civets and poultry, human actin proteins participate in internalization, ibuprofen that interacts with actin proteins should be investigated as a therapeutic, and finally that domain 266-330 of the S1 protein should be targeted by drugs or vaccines.It is a nice piece of work. The conclusions could be updated, for example they could say that the first of these predictions are supported by recent publications, that bat CoVs now appear to be the most closely related and bats are more likely to be the natural reservoir, and the link between ibuprofen/actin interactions and viral entry remains an exciting path for future therapeutics.",
