The identification of biomarkers to distinguish among members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) comprising M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium africanum, Mycobacterium bovis, M. bovis BCG, Mycobacterium microti and Mycobacterium canettii and non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) has been a challenge. This is due to the high similarity between the genomes of the MTBC members [4]. Examples include the >99.95% homology between M. bovis and M. tuberculosis genomes [5]. There have been conflicting reports on the ability to distinguish MTBC from NTM with the most widely studied potential biomarkers for MTB diagnosis, ESAT-6 and CFP-10 [6], [7], [8].",

The MPB64 antigen is an immunogenic protein found in unheated cultures of M. tuberculosis\n[9], [15], [16], [17]. These tests are based on detection from culture with the detection limit of 10.5 cfu/ml [12]. Since the production of this antigen is slow, it is not always detectable in liquid culture compared to solid media [10]. The ICT TB test is based on 5 M. tuberculosis antigens, including Antigen 85 and LAM [18], [19]. However, the ability of the ICT test to distinguish between MTBC and NTM has not been evaluated [18], [20]. Recently, ESAT-6/CFP-10 has been used in a nanoELIwell assay that integrates on chip culturing of cells, immunoassay and fluorescent imaging [8]. The advantages of this assay are high throughput and rapid culture. However, the sensitivity of this test would be reduced since ESAT-6 is secreted by many NTM [6], [7], [8]. An immunochromatographic test developed using both ESAT-6/CFP-10 complex showed high specificity and sensitivity of 97% and 97.4% respectively for MTBC organisms [21]. Despite the apparent high specificity and sensitivity compared to sputum smear and tuberculin skin tests, the study showed a greater chance of false negative and false positive results using these epitopes [21].",

M. abscessus amino acid sequence had a 44% pairwise sequence identity and 59% sequence similarity to the MTP amino acid sequence. Whilst the secondary structure was similar, the protein contained no transmembrane region. The M. avium amino acid sequence had a 43% pairwise sequence identity and 57% sequence similarity to the MTP amino acid sequence. However, the protein lacked a transmembrane region and contained 4 epitopes. The secondary structure comprised 6.3% strand structure and no \u03b1-helix. M. ulcerans amino acid sequence had the lowest similarity to the MTP amino acid sequence with 41% pairwise sequence identity and 53% sequence similarity. The protein contained no transmembrane region, 4 epitopes, and a highly looped secondary structure (Figure 4). It is therefore apparent that the proteins of M. abscessus, M. avium and M. ulcerans do not resemble the pilin subunit protein structure. The protein of M. marinum however, does resemble the pilin subunit protein of M. tuberculosis.",

MTP were proposed to be the first point of contact with the host and unique to pathogenic Mycobacteria. MTP were recently viewed by Atomic Force Microscopy in XDR-TB and TDR-TB strains [43]. It has been conclusively proven that the mtp gene is required for pili formation in M. tuberculosis\n[23], [44]. In this study, BLAST analysis of the complete genome sequences of various Mycobacteria and other respiratory pathogens and commensals [35], [36], [37], [39], as well as amplicon sequencing has proven conclusively that the mtp gene is unique to members of the MTBC. The very low frequency of mutations in the mtp gene indicated that it is highly conserved among the clinical strains of M. tuberculosis. Furthermore, the partial homology detected in NTM has not been linked to proteins similar to those encoding pilin subunits, with the exception of M. marinum. This is the first study providing evidence that the mtp gene is highly conserved, suggestive of the potential use of its encoded product, the MTP protein, as a biomarker for MTBC pathogens.",

In E. coli, curli pili are assembled via the nucleation precipitation pathway [32]. Little is known about the structure and assembly of MTP [23].

Previous studies identified an arsenal of novel M. tuberculosis antigens including 38-kDa antigen, 19-kDa lipoprotein, 16-kDa antigen, MTB81, ESAT-6, antigen 85B, MPT51, MPT32, 14-kDa antigen, A60, HBHA, PE and PPE antigens and the glycolipid antigens for use in serodiagnostic assays as reviewed by Abebe et al., 2007 [52]. The low and variable sensitivity of these assays based on the inclusion of a single biomarker led to the proposal of various combinations of these immunodominant antigens for the detection of different stages of TB infection or disease [53]. However, serodiagnostic tests aimed at measuring antibody levels in biological samples have proved unsuccessful [54], [55], [56], [57], [58]. Commercial point of care diagnostic tests that measure the presence of M. tuberculosis antigens such as MPT64 [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], ESAT-6/CFP-10 [7], [8], [21], [59], [60] and Antigen 85 [61] are limited as they are based on culture. The MPT64 antibodies showed a limited sensitivity of 64.4% when tested on sputum specimens in a sandwich Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis [62]. LAM antigens, either alone or with other epitopes have shown limited accuracy on clinical specimens [18], [20], [63]. Other epitopes that have been evaluated for diagnostic purposes include the IP-10 [64], B cell antigens [65], malate synthase and MPT51 [66], [67], [68].",

In addition to providing evidence of the conserved nature and specificity of the mtp gene to the MTBC in this study, we have detected the mtp gene transcript in broth and agar grown clinical MTBC strains in preliminary experiments using RT-PCR. Further studies are in progress to verify these results and to detect the presence of MTP in these strains. Furthermore, gene knockout and complementation studies have proved the essentiality of the mtp gene for MTP production [23], [44]. We therefore propose MTP as a relevant diagnostic marker for the MTBC. Studies are underway to screen for anti-pili antibodies in patients with various stages of tuberculosis and to generate monoclonal antibodies for the detection of MTP antigen in clinical specimens of patients with tuberculosis.",
