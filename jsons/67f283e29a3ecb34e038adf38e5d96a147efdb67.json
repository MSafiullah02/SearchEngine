In some assays,s uch as fluorescence anisotropy or saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR, high protein concentrations can be used instead to saturate the binding of the small-molecule ligand. Compared to other fragment-based methods without ligation, the detection problem, however,i ss ignificantly reduced in protein-templated fragment ligations due to the higher affinity of the fragment ligation product formed. As aresult, fragment ligation assays can, in principle,detect even low-affinity fragments that would not be identified in other fragment assays,for example,because of concentration limits. In general, fragments have to be present at concentrations that exceed their dissociation constants (K D values) by afactor of at least 10 for as trong, saturated detection signal to be measured. In contrast, in the case of afragment ligation assay,c oncentrations of the starting fragment below the K D value are typically used to effect only partial inhibition, which can be saturated by the formation of the stronger binding ligation product.",

            "text": "Several classical analytical methods have been widely applied and adapted to the detection of templated fragment ligations ( Figure 4 ). Most studies in the field have used liquid chromatography,usually in combination with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). [13, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] In some examples,s pecific methods of NMR spectroscopy were developed. [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] In addition, fragment ligations have been studied by X-ray crystallography. [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] Finally,asapowerful complement, the detection of fragment ligation products by various bioassays has been developed over recent years. [1, 10, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] Thed etection of fragment ligation products by LC-MS has become substantially easier over the last two decades because of the rapid development of this method in terms of chromatographic separation and the sensitivity of mass detectors. [13, [25] [26] [27] [28] Not only detection but also quantification and structure elucidation of ligation products is facilitated by using extracted-ion or single-ion chromatography and MS-MS techniques.S ome limitations remain, however.A s chromatographic separation takes some time,L C-MS detection is best suited for irreversible or quasi-irreversible ligation reactions. [15, 49] In the case of reversibly formed ligation products,t heir chemical fixation by ac hemical reaction or ap Hs hift can be an option. This strategy was followed, for example,i nt he seminal report by Huc and Lehn on \"virtual chemical libraries\", in which the unstable imine ligation products were converted into stable amines by chemical reduction during the ligation reaction. [21] Asecond limitation of LC-MS detection can arise from the buffer systems used in fragment ligation reactions.Many buffer ions used in ligation assays interfere with the detection of ligation products in the mass detector,w hereas buffer salts such as ammonium formiate or acetate that are highly compatible with LC-MS may interfere with the ligation reaction by adding reactive nucleophiles in strong excess.Inrecent years,the detection of protein-binding fragments by native protein MS has developed into am ature technology and it is very likely that this method will also be useful for the detection of fragment ligation products. [50] [51] [52] [53] NMR spectroscopy has the big advantage over LC that it can monitor ligation reactions directly in the assay solution. As standard NMR spectroscopy requires high (mm)c oncentrations of fragment ligation products in volumes of around 0.5 mL for the chemical analysis,l arge amounts of proteins are required. [54] Therefore,t he method is only applicable to proteins that are available in large quantities and only af ew experiments with low throughput can be conducted. The throughput can be enhanced if mixtures of reactive fragments are employed that undergo reversible,c ovalent ligation reactions. [33, [55] [56] [57] These mixtures are denominated as dynamic combinatorial libraries (DCL), or dynamic covalent libraries, and can in principle form all possible combinations of the available fragment building blocks,that is,inthe case of n and m complementary reactive building blocks,anumber of n m possible products are obtained. Thep rotein template shifts the equilibrium in favor of the best binding and, thus,m ost stabilized ligation product, which is then detected by one of the classical analytical methods.",

            "text": "Several NMR methods have been adapted specifically for the detection of fragment ligation products.R amstr\u00e7m and co-workers have investigated 1 HSTD NMR spectroscopy for the detection of hemithioacetals formed by ap rotein-templated reaction in aqueous medium ( Figure 5 ). [58] 1 HSTD NMR spectroscopy is am ethod that exploits the selective transfer of proton magnetization from the protein to reversibly bound ligands and was used here to identify binding fragments from aD CL. Foraproof of concept study, bgalactosidase was selected as the target protein that catalyzes the hydrolysis of O-b-galactosides and contains no cysteine residues in the active site.Amixture of five thiols and two aldehydes was employed, thereby resulting in the potential formation of ten hemithioacetals.Itwas demonstrated that 1b-mercapto-d-galactose binds more strongly to the target enzyme than do the four other thiols and strongly enhanced the signals of both aldehydes in the STD spectrum-presumably through the formation of hemothioacetals. Surprisingly,t he binding of the two sugars could not be suppressed by the addition of substrate,t hus suggesting additional allosteric binding sites for these fragments.S ignificant inhibition of substrate hydrolysis could be confirmed for one thiol-aldehyde combination, which also suggests the formation of hemithioacetals as active inhibitors. Another application of STD NMR spectroscopy was published recently by the Hirsch research group. [36] Recently, 11 BNMR spectroscopy was applied by Claridge and coworkers for the detection of fragment ligation products (see Figure 10 in Section 5). [59] In addition to ligand-based NMR spectroscopy,t here have been intensive applications of protein-based NMR methods for the detection of protein-binding fragments. [60, 61] Protein NMR spectroscopy uses in many cases proteins that have been produced with 13 Cand 15 Nisotopes to enhance the NMR signals.F ragment binding can then be observed, for example,in2DHSQC experiments from perturbations of the chemical shifts.T he method was introduced as \"structureactivity relationships (SAR) by NMR spectroscopy\" and has the big advantage of furnishing information on the binding site of fragments if the signals in the NMR spectra are assigned to the protein structure. [62] Protein-based NMR spectroscopy should also be av aluable method for the investigation of fragment ligation reactions, although we could not find applications of it so far. X-ray crystallography has found broad application in fragment-based drug discovery,a nd its attractiveness comes from the detailed structural information it reveals of the fragment-protein complex. [63] This information can be extremely helpful in the design of fragment combination products.S everal studies have so far used protein crystallography for the detection of fragment ligation products. [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] Ther apid and parallel detection of potent fragment ligation products formed in proteintemplated reactions was finally realized by the introduction of bioactivity-based assays.The initial strategy was denominated as dynamic ligation screening (DLS), as reversible ligation reactions were first investigated. DLS increased the sensitivity of ligand detection considerably,a nd the site-directed discovery of low affinity fragments with millimolar K D values was realized ( Figure 6 ). [10, 43] Bioactivity-based detection methods require only minimal amounts of protein;u sually low nanomolar concentrations of the protein are sufficient. They can be conducted using standard assay equipment such as microtiter plates and automated pipetting devices used for the handling of fragment libraries.I ne nzyme assays,t he sensitivity is further enhanced by the catalytic activity of the Figure 5 . Application of 1 HSTD NMR spectroscopy for detecting the proteintemplated formation of hemithioacetals from adynamic combinatoriall ibrary and enzymatic selection of the best inhibitor. [58] protein targets resulting in the rapid turnover of many of the fluorogenic or chromogenic substrate molecules.F luorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has also been used for the detection of fragment combinations. [44] To reach the highest sensitivity,t he primary reactive fragment has to be added to the enzyme assay at ac oncentration that results in 10-20 %i nhibition, thereby leaving am easurement window of 80-90 %f or detection of the enhanced inhibition after addition of the secondary fragment.",

Fragment binding can be observed by as ignificant enhancement of the proteinsmelting temperature because of the free binding energy of the ligand. Even more thermodynamic information about the binding of fragments is revealed by isothermal titration calorimetry and future studies will most likely use this technique-although it requires al arge quantity of protein and can be conducted only at low throughput.

These methods are labelfree with respect to the fragments;h owever,c ovalent immobilization or labeling with affinity probes such as biotin are required. [71] [72] [73] [74] Recently,t he bioactivity-based detection of fragment ligation products has been further extended from protein assays to even more complex cellular experiments. [75, 76] Ohkanda and co-workers have reported the intracellular generation of the inhibitor 3 of the 14-3-3 protein by intracellular oxime ligation (Figure 8 ). The1 4-3-3 protein is involved in protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which are especially difficult to inhibit, as interactions of large and dynamic interaction surfaces have to be disrupted by molecules that are still able to penetrate cells through cellular uptake.T he authors realized that the reactive aldehyde derivative of fusicoccin A( Fc, 1)b inds in ah ydrophobic cavity adjacent to the binding site of peptide 2,which contains ah ydroxylamine functionality.T hey were able to demonstrate the templated formation of ah eterobivalent ligation product, the potent oxime inhibitor 3,i nvitro in the presence of 14-3-3 protein. Next, the authors investigated the intracellular formation of 3 in stably transformed HEK293 (Flag 14-3-3 z cell line). HPLC analysis showed the formation of 3 in cells treated with 1 and 2,w hich led to the highest cytotoxic effect. In contrast, chemically synthesized 3 was inactive in the cells,p ossibly because of the large molecular size that impedes their cell-penetrating properties (Figure 8 ). [77] Thus,t his study demonstrates that even large molecules that potentially modulate PPIs can be generated through intracellular protein-templated fragment ligation.",

[46] In contrast to the hemiacetals,\" full\" acetals or dithioacetals (obtained by the addition of two alcohol or thiol nucleophiles to one carbonyl group) have not been reported as templated ligation products and cannot be expected to be formed because of the high activation barrier to the carbocation intermediates in this reaction.

[86, 87, 89, 99] Alternatively,the equilibration of acyl hydrazones can be accelerated by the addition of acid. [98] Further ligations of heteronucleophiles with aldehydes are awaiting further investigation. Forexample,thiols can be added to imines to furnish N,S-acetals in al igation equilibrium that can possibly be shifted by interaction with aprotein template. [43, 46, 112] Bioactivity data obtained from the investigation of ap resubstrate have suggested that the trimeric complexes of aldehyde,a mine,a nd thiol have as tronger affinity to the protein target, as expressed by ar educed K M value and increased turnover of the enzyme substrates.

            "text": "Boric acid and boronic acids have been used as alternative electrophiles.T he use of diols as bisnucleophiles furnishes boronate esters as ligation products with limited stability. [59, 125] Other popular examples of reversible reactions that furnish stable products that can be isolated are disulfide formation and disulfide exchange reactions through the use of thiolates as the reactive nucleophiles under slightly basic and nonreducing conditions. [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] Asimilar exchange reaction of thiolates has been reported for the thioester exchange reaction. [33, 55, 82, [108] [109] [110] C \u00c0 Cb ond-forming reactions are of special interest in templated ligations,a st hey can extend the choice and diversity of the accessible ligations products considerably.F ew examples have been reported to date. Ramstr\u00e7m and co-workers have described ar eversible templated Henry-aldol addition of nitroalkanes to aldehydes,i n which the formed, best-bound secondary alcohol was preferably acylated by the lipase as the protein target in the assay. [56] Although no further reports on templated aldol reactions have yet been published, this reaction type should be highly suitable for fragment ligation chemistry considering the detailed literature on aldol reactions in water and under mild reaction conditions. [56, 111, 116, 128] Likewise,a dditions of cyanide anions and isocyanides have been reported in water, which suggests that Passerini and Ugi reactions might be highly suitable for protein-templated reactions.T he same applies to the C\u00c0Cb ond formations by alkene and alkyne metathesis reactions,which have so far been demonstrated as ligation reactions in water. [112] [113] [114] [115] Classical examples of irreversible templated reactions have been reported for dipolar cycloaddition reactions, including azide-alkyne ligations that furnish 1,4-disubstituted a) Hemiacetals, b) hemithioacetals, c) acetals. d) thioacetals, e) N,S-acetals, f) imines, g) hydrazones, g')acylhydrazones, h) oximes, i) boronates, j) disulfides, k) thioesters, l) alkene metathesis, m) alkyne metathesis, n) nitroaldols o) alkylation, p) amidation between sulfonylazides and thioacids, q) 1,3-dipolarcycloaddition,r)addition, s) ring opening, t) amidation between amines and active esters. ,2,3-triazoles,a nd sulfonylazide-thioacid ligations that provide sulfonylamides through ac yclic intermediate. [24, 25, 76, [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] It is clear that numerous other ligations based on cycloaddition reactions may also succeed. Besides cycloaddition reactions,h owever, irreversible ligations have not yet been investigated much and future extensions are necessary to provide ligation products that cover alarger part of the biologically relevant chemical space.I ng eneral, chemoselective reactions in water are required for asuccessful ligation. Ideally,the reaction should provide alinker between the reacting fragments that supports binding or at least does not interfere with it. Fore xample,t he structural analysis of the world drug index (a collection of molecules with reported bioactivity) revealed that amide linkages are privileged linkers in bioactive compounds. [129] Thus,aprotein-templated amidation reaction can be considered an especially useful extension of the fragment ligation repertoire.V ery recently the first background-free protein-templated amidation reactions were discovered. [48] Other reaction types that could considerably extend the opportunities of fragment ligations are reactions that are able to connect fragments without al inker remaining in the product, such as cross-coupling reactions or reactions forming heterocycles as the connection between two fragments instead of ac lassical linker moiety.",

As ar ecent representative example of this line of research, we highlight the studies by Hirsch and co-workers. [36, 98] Theauthors employed endothiapepsin as atarget and model enzyme for other aspartic acid proteases.N ine hydrazides (4-12)and one bisaldehyde were used to form adynamic library derived from two fragment hits [36] that bind to adjacent binding pockets of endothiapepsin ( Figure 9 ). [98] To ease analysis, two sublibraries (DCL-1 and DCL-2) were formed that consisted of four and five hydrazides.R eversed-phase HPLC and LC-MS were employed to analyze the templated formation of the bisacylhydrazone ligation products in the presence of endothiapepsin. Out of the potential 78 different bisacylhydrazones and 12 monoacylhydrazones,o nly 6p ossible fragment combinations showed significant amplification of the HPLC signal in the presence of the endothiapepsin template.T wo of the found combinations, 13 and 16,w ere synthesized and tested in af luorescence-based biochemical assay.B oth were reported to be active,and the best inhibitor, 13,showed a240fold increase in potencyc ompared to the starting fragments, thus illustrating as uccessful example of at emplated threefragment ligation reaction. Thea uthors demonstrated in this study that, unlike other fragment optimization methods such as fragment growing or merging, templated fragment ligation is especially sensitive for discovering combined fragments with superadditivity,w here their ligand efficiencies were not only maintained but improved. In their approach, the challenge lay in preserving the binding mode of the fragments and finding aw ell-fitting linker that provides additional interactions to the target. Despite the positive results,t he study also demonstrates the limitations of DCL, namely the tedious analysis of complex combinatorial mixtures and the limitation to few dynamic reactions that deliver non-druglike products such as acylhydrazones.

[131] Thetethering approach is aclassical example of reversible templated fragment ligations using disulfide exchange reactions. [132] This method exploits the reversible disulfide exchange reaction between an atural or an engineered cysteine residue on the protein surface and ad isulfidecontaining small-molecule fragment in solution. Further developments by the Erlanson group using so-called \"extenders\" made this approach even more applicable for fragment combination reactions. [133] In 2008 they reported an inhibitor screening that targeted the aurora kinase ( Figure 11 ). [134] The first step was to introduce ac ysteine residue near the ATP binding site.N ext, an extender was synthesized containing two disulfide-containing residues and ad iaminopyridine group,w hich is known to bind to the purine binding site. One disulfide residue was able to react and exchange with the introduced cysteine residue,t he other one was able to bind as econdary disulfide fragment. If this secondary fragment was able to interact with the adaptive region of the protein adjacent to the extender,athermodynamically stabilized disulfide bond was formed. This stabilized complex was subsequently detected by MS measurements through modification of the proteinsm ass.I nt heir experiments,alibrary containing roughly 4500 disulfide-containing fragments was screened in pools of 10 compounds,w hich resulted in the identification of several fragment combinations.Afew modifications of the corresponding fragments led to the formation of astable inhibitor with affinity in the micromolar range.Asimilar approach has been successfully applied to another kinase,3 -phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), by attaching the extender through an irreversible alkylation reaction. [135] Dynamic ligation screening was introduced in 2008 to overcome the detection limits of combinatorial methods such as DCL. Thef irst bioactivity-based detection of dynamically formed fragment ligation products has been demonstrated for Figure 10 .

Theinhibitor displayed aremarkable superadditive enhancement of its free binding energy (the K I value was 29 nm instead of 3 mm for the additive case), which was proven to result from the relatively decreased entropy of binding because of fragment linking.T he protein-inhibitor complex was crystallized and the obtained high-resolution structure allowed the authors to rationalize the templated amidation reaction in steric and mechanistic detail.

[85] Nucleophilic amine fragment 24 binds to the S1 pocket of the enzyme (A) to reversibly form af ragment ligation product with the biselectrophilic warhead 23 (B). Next the epoxide is opened by attack of the cysteine side chain in the active site, as detected by LC-MS (C). The ligation product displays asuperadditive inhibitory effect in the FRET assay and is optimized to potent broadband inhibitors of enteroviral and rhinoviral 3C proteases. Figure 14 .

Other fragment-based methods,f or example X-ray crystallography and some of the NMR-based methods,a lso deliver structural information on ligand binding,h owever, they cannot be used to screen specifically for one binding site. Site-directed fragment detection is realized by the structure and by the defined binding of the reactive starting fragment. Thes econd major advantage of protein-templated fragment ligation assays is their sensitivity caused by the (super-) additive binding enhancement of ligated fragments.A s ar esult, fragment ligation assays can identify fragments that are not detectable with other fragment-based discovery methods or only at considerably higher fragment or protein concentrations.Thus,the method may provide protein ligands with alternative structures and with improved ligand efficiencies.A sathird advantage,p rotein-templated fragment ligations have practical and economic benefits,mainly arising from the integration of the synthesis of fragment combinations and the detection of bioactivity in one step.Asaresult, the effort and the resources required for the chemical synthesis of bioactive ligands are reduced considerably,a s only bioactive fragment combinations need to be resynthesized for further structural and functional validation.
