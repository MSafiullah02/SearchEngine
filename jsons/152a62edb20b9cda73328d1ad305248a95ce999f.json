            "text": "Goal: As the Coronavirus Pandemic of 2019/2020 unfolds, a COVID-19 'Immunity Passport' has been mooted as a way to enable individuals to return back to work or be admitted to current off-limits locations. While the quality of antibody testing and the likelihood of even attaining COVID-19 immunity continue to be researched, we address the issues involved in providing tamper-proof and privacy-preserving certification, both for COVID-19 immunity and in general. Methods: We developed a prototype mobile phone app and requisite distributed server architecture that facilitates instant verification of tamper-proof test results. Personally identifiable information is only stored at the user's discretion, and the app allows the enduser selectively to present only the specific test result with no other personal information revealed. Behind the scenes it relies upon (a) the 2019 World Wide Web Consortium standard called 'Verifiable Credentials', (b) Tim Berners-Lee's decentralized personal data platform 'Solid', and (c) a consortium Ethereumbased blockchain. Results: Our mobile phone app and distributed server architecture enable the mixture of verifiability and privacy in a manner derived from public/private key pairs and digital signatures, generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of sensitive digital keys and/or data. For the test certificate Holder, Issuer (e.g. doctor, pharmacy) and Verifier (e.g. employer), it is 'just another app' which takes only minutes to use. Conclusions: The app and distributed server architecture offer a prototype proof of concept that is readily scalable, applicable generically, and in effect 'waiting in the wings' for the biological issues, plus key ethical issues raised in the discussion section, to be resolved.",

In Fig. 2 , our Holder's Solid Pod contains a scanned image of a physical ID such as a driving license and the Holder's signed and countersigned certificate of COVID-19 Immunity certification -represented in Fig. 2 as a 'document' in which is embedded a special QR code. The Holder is free to store the Solid Pod data on his/her mobile, on a personal favorite cloud provider, or both, as shown in the 'Hosted' arrows in Fig. 2 . At any time, Holders can move or delete data, as it remains under their ownership. One-way encoded 'hashes' of the data (only a few bytes in size) are held, as shown by the dotted arrow in the upper right of Fig. 2 , on a blockchain to support independent verification. In our design, we use a 'Consortium blockchain', shown in the red circle in Fig. 2 : this is not a fully public blockchain like Ethereum or Bitcoin, but rather a blockchain shared specifically by a consortium of known providers who have signed up to the Ethics Guidelines we describe in the Discussion Section. The Open University-led Consortium blockchain is a private Ethereum network known as OpenEthereum (formerly Parity Ethereum) [13, 14] which uses a 'Proof of Authority' consensus mechanism [15] wherein several nodes can be in the mutually-agreed privileged position of being allowed to confirm transactions. This contrasts with Bitcoin and other early blockchains which use the slow and ecologically unfriendly Proof of Work, wherein massive computing power enables nodes to have a better chance of confirming transactions. This gives us the kind of distributed scalability that increases security, but without the specter of international public availability that may serve as a disincentive for individuals to participate.",

This has enabled us to provide a facility that is 'just another app' from the viewpoint of the end-user, healthcare professionals, employers and other relevant authorities -thereby providing a tamper-proof record owned entirely by the end-user, and allowing the end-user selectively to reveal solely the proof of test results without surrendering other personal information, and requiring only mobile phone app downloads from everyone in the loop. This app and its secure digital certificate thus become a powerful adjunct/enhancement to traditional paper-based certification from the NHS or Pharmaceutical testing authority -and without the need for the costly installation of special 'e-ticket reader' hardware: the same mobile phone app is sufficient for the task at hand, regardless of which of the three roles is involved. Many other uses of secure and private certification via mobile phone app and distributed servers are additionally made possible. ",

            "text": "The premise of immunity: Throughout most of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has advocated a 'test-isolate-trace' approach [21] . In parallel, there has been a worldwide cooperative effort to develop a vaccine [22] and to develop numerous serological tests for the presence of antibodies [23] . If immunity is strongly implied by the outcomes of these latter tests, then individuals could be allowed to get back to work, particularly in healthcare and other key areas [2, 3] . The WHO, however, has warned that the very premise of COVID-19 immunity is itself uncertain: 'With regards to recovery and then reinfection ... we do not have the answers to that. That is an unknown' [24] . Some immunologists have indeed argued that COVID-19 immunity could be very weak, because 'reinfection is an issue with the four seasonal coronaviruses that cause about 10% to 30% of common colds' [25] . Others in that same discussion argue that immunity could be valid for 'a year or two', a view shared by Male, who with Golding and Bootman has written a clear exposition on the life-cycle of infection, antibody detection, and likely immunity to COVID-19 [26] . A related challenge is the quality of the testing: test sensitivity (% positive detection for the right antibodies, so high sensitivity means few false positives) and specificity (% negatives correctly detected, so high specificity means few false negatives) are undergoing great scrutiny even as we write this [27] , and are naturally a matter of concern, because they must be sufficiently high to make the approach worthwhile. In the meantime, our research aims to find an approach to achieve highly robust certification, so that it is ready to deploy as-and-when the ongoing biological research satisfies the necessary quality criteria.",

The 'secret sauce' of zero knowledge proofs, as illustrated in [32, 33] , is that a mathematical function works through a proof of some fact (such as age being greater than or equal to X, or the existence of a certain credential), in such a way that the actual steps involved in executing the proof only reach a positive outcome if the fact is true (for example, the positive outcome may require a certain number of steps to execute): so the proof is valid, but still only indirect (e.g. counting the steps executed) without touching the raw data [31, 32] .",

How is it possible that no personal information is stored in a database? What about the certificate itself? That's the beauty of Verifiable Credentials, Zero Knowledge Proofs and our approach of Minimum and Encoded Data Storage / User's Choice: taken together, this combined approach offers cryptographically signed, verifiable, un-tamperable proof that the certificate being shown was really granted by a known testing authority to the person in question, even without showing the name, address, phone number or even UK NHS number of the person holding it.",

Yes, a secure digital certificate could hypothetically be weaponized to a greater degree than a paper one, but the actual degree could be something of a mind-set illusion. Any certification method has such potential, and therefore, rather than casting the technology in terms of 'good vs evil' we think our approach is best considered as something that involves a trade-off between (a) the advantages of getting people back to work using good privacy-preserving fraud-prevention methods and (b) the disadvantages of discriminatory (mis)use of such methods. Our approach to this trade-off is strongly to nudge things towards (a), and therefore we propose the following concrete steps to achieve this:",

This helps introduce the concept and technology in a gentle manner: people will ultimately decide what they prefer for themselves. \u2022 Implementations must comply with UK NHS Information Governance (IG) guidelines [19, 20] . Compliance should in principle be straightforward, because (a) in our approach, personally identifiable information is stored entirely under the Holder's control, and additionally for later verification purposes in minimal hash-encoded form on a consortium blockchain, and (b) the app allows the user selectively to present only the specific test result, with no other personal information revealed. Even so, the UK NHS IG documents provide a strong guiding framework for ensuring continuing compliance, particularly with respect to relevant EU GDPR requirements such as 'Right to erasure' and 'Right to data portability': our architecture by its very design avoids database storage of personally identifiable information, but oversight of possible misuse/abuse of this and related technologies needs to be maintained, as the next three bullet points suggest. \u2022 COVID-19 Antibody Test Certificates should only be applied to workers in healthcare and other comparable key sectors, as defined by the appropriate UK Parliamentary process (for example, the list of key exceptions to mandatory business closure during the current pandemic was specified by the UK Ministry of Housing, Communities, and Local Government), with input from an Ethics Committee mentioned next. \u2022 An Ethics Committee, comparable in scope and composition to the UK NHS Research Ethics Committees, should have oversight of actual deployment of the approach advocated herein. \u2022 The approach should be reviewed on a 3-monthly basis.",

We believe that, just as with train e-tickets, end-users will 'vote with their feet' and deploy the app in large numbers once its benefits have been demonstrated. To take a stance against what we call the 'Pandora's Box of Bad Use', we proposed ethical guidelines at the end of the Discussion, which we believe are essential for the principled development and deployment of the prototype described in this paper.",
