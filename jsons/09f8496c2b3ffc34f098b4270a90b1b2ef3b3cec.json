            "text": "Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide health problem threating the life of people. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified the outbreak as a pandemic. As of April 11 29, 2020 , the COVID-19 has been responsible for more than 1653,240 3052,370 infections and 102,088 216,563 deaths worldwide (1) . Adults represent the population with the highest infection rate; however, babies, children, and old aged patients can also be contaminated by the SARS-CoV-2. Intriguing findings worldwide has shown that children are less susceptible to COVID-19. Data from China's analysis has shown that children aged less than 10 years account for only 1% of COVID-19 patients (2) .Otherwise , the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that up to 20th of March, 6.3% of subjects with COVID-19 were children aged less than 19 years old (3). Findings from Italian research, has reported that up to 18th March, only 1.2% of 22,512 Italian patients were children (4) .By March 16 ,2020 , 0.8 % of confirmed patients in Madrid , the capital of Spain were aged less than 18 years old (5) . Besides ,the United States US has reported that up to 16th March 5% of patients with COVID-19 cases were children (6) while this proportion was reduced to 1.7 % on the 2 April (7). Available statistic data support the evidence that children are less infected elsewhere in the world but clinical characteristics details and countries' difference of paediatric COVID-19 aspects are rarely reported. Such ambiguity may present a dangerous situation that lead paradoxically to a less protection and a neglect of children from the part of their parents and countries.",

Probably there is a regulating mechanism between the immune system and the respiratory tract contributing to milder disease (22) .

Nevertheless, a systematic review has suggested that COVID-19 is either rare in children or it has not been diagnosed because the predominant asymptomatic forms (20) .Consistent with this, a Chinese observational study including 36 children , has shown that 28 % of these children had no symptoms although they had a positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic test (21) . This study has also suggested that the percentage of the asymptomatic forms in children might attempt the half of the infected children in China. However, such conclusions are based on observational results with very low evidence and should be taken with caution. In fact , contracting to the Chinese study , only 1.3 % of paediatric cases in the US were asymptomatic (7) . The asymptomatic form is defined by testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, but without clinical symptoms or abnormal chest imaging findings (6).",

COVID-19 can be presented in children just only by ocular abnormalities. In fact, recently, a case of a child aged 2 years and 10 months who was admitted to the hospital for conjunctivitis and eyelid dermatitis without any other symptom, has been reported (26) . The final diagnostic was therefore COVID-19 (26) . More severe potential association in paediatric patients has been suggested this last time. Paediatrics has noted the rising of the presenting cases with multi-system hyperinflammatory state, toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease (KD) during this critical period, seen in both children with positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test(27). The association wasn't confirmed due to the lack of serological data. However, there are some arguments that support this observation. The KD is an acute vasculitis in childhood that can occur after viral infection in childhood. Although that the real cause of KD remains until today unclear, several studies has reported that this condition may be attributable to enterovirus , rhinovirus , parainfluenza and others viruses (28) . The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the coronavirus and its implication in KD can't be rejected. Besides, Venaa G and al has published since the 7 April a case of a baby aged six months who presented a classic KD and in whom the diagnostic of COVID-19 has been confirmed (25) .This author has pointed toward this association and suggested that KD might be one of the complication or manifestation of paediatric COVID-19 (25) . Although there is actually no scientific proof confirming this association (between KD and COVID-19), doctors should take it into consideration. This is because the KD may alter the quality of life of children and is the most common cause leading to paediatric heart disease (29) . Echocardiogram is necessary at the baseline and at the six week. This disease often occurs in children aged less than 5 years old but an early treatment by intravenous immunoglobulin can reduce the mortality and morbidity (29) . The diagnostic of the KD requires the presence of persistent fever at least five days, in combination with four of five features belonging to this following list : conjunctivitis , lymphadenopathy ,rash , erythema and hyperaemia of lip and oral mucosa and finally hyperaemia and desquamation in extremities (29) . Doctors should be vigilant and evoke KD in children with fever, rash and severe inflammation in patients with or without confirmed COVID-19 but should also screen for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with KD. Further studies are necessary to infirm or confirm this association. This novel virus may be severe in children and lead to hospitalization.",
