Increased reports demonstrated that TRIMs exerted crucial roles in multiple biological processes, including cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation, carcinogenesis and antiviral immunity [2], [3], [4], [5]. Recently, a great deal work focused great attention on the potential roles of TRIM proteins in the antiviral immune response against DNA or RNA viruses [5], [6]. TRIM56 functioned as an antiviral host factor that confers resistance to yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2), and human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 through overlapping and distinct molecular determinants [7]. TRIM6 was found to interact with IKK\u03b5 and promoted induction of IKK\u03b5-dependent IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) [8]. In addition, TRIM25, TRIM13, and TRIM44 were also demonstrated to exert critical roles in antiviral immune response [5], [6], [9]. However, all these research efforts so far on the roles of TRIMs in antiviral immunity were mainly from the mammalian studies.",

In vitro, TRIM8 could interact with protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3), and the overexpression of TRIM8 abolished the negative effect of PIAS3 on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), either by degradation of PIAS3 or exclusion of PIAS3 from the nucleus [10]. The ectopic expression of TRIM8 also activated NF-\u03baB and mediated TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and K63-linked polyubiquitination of TAK1 [11]. Moreover, TRIM8 was found to physically interact with p53, impairing its interaction with murine double minute 2 (MDM2), suggested that TRIM8 could be proposed as a novel therapeutic target to enhance p53 tumor suppressor activity [12]. In addition, TRIM8 was able to interact with suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1), and its expression decreased the repression of interferon gamma signaling mediated by SOCS-1 [13]. Although molecular functions of mammalian TRIM8 were explored in multiple biological processes, the roles of its corresponding homolog in fish still remained largely unknown. Moreover, the potential roles of TRIM8 during virus infection also remained uncertain in both mammals and fish.",

However, the outbreak of iridoviral and nodaviral diseases always caused heavy economic losses in grouper aquaculture [14], [15], [16], [17]. As two important pathogens, Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) and red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) usually caused extremely high mortality at different developmental stages of grouper [15], [16]. Although several immune regulatory molecules have been illustrated to play crucial roles in grouper immune defense against fish virus infection [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], limited references focused on grouper TRIM family proteins [25]. Our previous reports demonstrated that grouper TRIM39 was able to inhibit grouper iridovirus and nervous necrosis virus infection in vitro\n[25]. However, no references focused on the roles of other grouper TRIMs during virus infection up to now.",

Our previous reports on grouper transcriptomic studies suggested that several TRIM genes might be involved in SGIV infection [27]. In this study, EcTRIM8 was cloned and its detailed roles were investigated. Sequence analysis indicated that the obtained EcTRIM8 homolog shared the highest identity with large yellow croaker. Amino acid alignment analysis showed that EcTRIM8 contained the conserved RING, B-BOX, and coiled-coil domains like mammalian TRIM8, suggesting that EcTRIM8 might be functional in various biological process. In considering that previous studies on TRIM8 mainly focused on its roles in inflammation and cancer [11], [12], we further investigated the potential function of EcTRIM8 in virus infection. Here, we found that the transcription of EcTRIM8 in grouper spleen was increased after challenge with SGIV or poly I:C, suggested that EcTRIM8 might play crucial roles in fish immune response against viruses infection. In addition, our results showed that EcTRIM8 displayed different distribution patterns in transfected cells, including punctate fluorescence and bright aggregates. Although punctate fluorescence was also observed in mammalian TRIM8 transfected cells, the aggregates were not described in the published reference [28]. Whether the specific localization patterns of EcTRIM8 were associated with its function was still uncertain.",

TRIM56 functioned as an antiviral host factor that confers resistance to YFV, DENV2, and HCoV OC43 through overlapping and distinct molecular determinants [7]. In vitro, ectopic expression of feline TRIM25 in HEK293T cells reduced viral protein levels leading to the inhibition of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) release at the late stage of virus infection [29]. Although TRIM8 has been demonstrated to play critical roles in inflammation and carcinogenesis [30], the roles of TRIM8 in virus infection still remained uncertain. In our study, overexpression of EcTRIM8 significantly reduced the severity of CPE evoked by SGIV or RGNNV infection. At the transcription level, viral genes including SGIV MCP, VP19, ICP-18, RGNNV CP and RdRp genes were all significantly inhibited by ectopic expression of EcTRIM8. At the protein level, the protein synthesis of SGIV VP19 and RGNNV CP protein were both significantly decreased in EcTRIM8 overexpressing cells. Thus, we proposed that TRIM8 was also an important antiviral factor in response to virus infection.",

            "text": "It has been reported that multiple signaling molecules were mediated or modified by TRIM proteins in innate immune response or virus infection [31], [32]. TRIM13 inhibited MDA5 activity during encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection [5], while TRIM56 overexpression enhanced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation after double-stranded DNA stimulation [33]. Overexpression of TRIM21 resulted in more degradation of DDX41 and less production of interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) in response to intracellular dsDNA [32], and knockdown of TRIM38 expression resulted in augmented activation of IRF3 and enhanced expression of IFN-\u03b2\n[34]. In our study, the ectopic expression of EcTRIM8 in vitro not only regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also altered the expression of interferon related signaling molecules or IRF3/IRF7 induced ISRE promoter activity. Moreover, the transcription of these pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon related signaling molecules induced by SGIV or RGNNV infection was also differently regulated by the ectopic expression of EcTRIM8. Given that interferon signaling molecules usually played crucial roles against RNA virus infection, and grouper ISG15 and IRF3 have been demonstrated to exert antiviral function in response to RGNNV infection [22], [35], we proposed that the positively regulatory roles on interferon signaling might directly contribute to the antiviral action of EcTRIM8 against RGNNV infection. In contrast, the interferon related molecules including both grouper IRF3 and ISG15 were not able to inhibited SGIV infection in vitro\n[22], [35], we speculated that the inhibitory effect of EcTRIM8 on SGIV replication might be mainly due to its regulatory roles on the pro-inflammatory cytokines during virus infection. Together, EcTRIM8 exerted antiviral roles against iridovirus and nodavirus infection via different potential mechanism.",
