Although recommendations vary with regard to time of first vaccine, these vaccines are typically given twice at 3- to 6-week intervals in the first year and then boostered annually after the primary series. It is known that camelids are susceptible to these pathogens, and several studies have shown antibody response after two injections.1 In some high-risk areas, the primary vaccines are started at age 2 to 5 days. Another protocol would be to start the vaccination series at age 3 to 4 months in crias that obtained good passive transfer and whose dams were previously vaccinated. Booster vaccines are generally recommended for animals undergoing surgical procedures or for animals that have suffered open wounds from trauma if the last vaccine was given more than 6 months ago. Many practitioners recommend boosting CDT vaccines 4 to 6 weeks prior to birthing in pregnant dams. Be cautious of rough handling or excessive excitement during the vaccine administration procedure, as camelids are considered prone to stress-induced abortions.",

Oral administration of a modified live bovine rotavirus or coronavirus vaccine in neonates before nursing could be used in these situations.11 Diarrhea in show animals during the 2008 show season was widely reported across the United States. Many of these were confirmed to have been caused by coronavirus. Although most of these were self-limiting and resolved within a few days, the diarrhea typically affected other animals on the farm, even with the farms practicing adequate biosecurity measures.
