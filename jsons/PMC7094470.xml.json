            "text": "Conventional calf feeding programs have restricted the amount of milk and milk replacer (MR) fed during the preweaning period in an effort to encourage more solid feed intake, minimize the cost of feeding and labor, and reduce the potential for scours and other diseases (Kertz et al., 1979; Otterby and Linn, 1981; Davis and Drackley, 1998). The standard recommendations have been to feed whole milk at 8 to 10% of calf BW or 454 to 567 g of MR powder regardless of body size twice a day until weaning to provide enough energy to support minimal BW gains of 0.3 to 0.4 kg/d, depending upon starter intake, management, health, and environmental changes to meet requirements for maintenance under thermoneutral conditions (Davis and Drackley, 1998). Greater starter intakes before weaning ensure that weight gains and intakes will be sustained after weaning (Kertz et al., 1979). These recommendations are in contrast to numerous studies that have demonstrated calves fed greater intakes of milk solids as well as greater protein concentrations in MR have greater DMI, ADG, and overall skeletal measurements, (Appleby et al., 2001; Jasper and Weary, 2002) but calves consume less starter, which can lead to a more stressful time during weaning and less rumen development (Huber et al., 1984; Cowles et al., 2006; Hill et al., 2010; Guindon et al., 2015), which places this type of program in direct opposition to the conventional calf management described above. Currently, an intensified optimum MR with CP levels greater than the 20% found in conventional MR is being fed to calves, which more closely resembles whole milk (Diaz et al., 2001). Feeding a MR with >25% CP at an rate increasing with age up to 900 to 1,200 g of DM/d has allowed for greater BW gain than conventional MR programs (Diaz et al., 2001; Tikofsky et al., 2001; Blome et al., 2003; Bartlett et al., 2006). These high feeding rates can capitalize on the rapid and efficient early lean growth potential of calves and allow for increased body protein deposition and growth rate (Kertz and Loften, 2013).",

            "text": "The decrease in starter intake during the preweaning period with these high feeding rates of milk and MR can inhibit rumen development and digestibility of nutrients postweaning (Terr\u00e9 et al., 2007a,b; Hill et al., 2010; Chapman et al., 2016). Chapman et al. (2016) showed that calves fed 0.87 kg of DM of a 27% CP, 17% fat MR preweaning had a reduction in postweaning OM digestibility of 11% and a reduction in NDF digestibility of 28% compared with control calves fed 0.44 kg of DM of a 21% CP, 21% fat MR. Terr\u00e9 et al. (2007a,b) also showed that digestibility of NDF was 40% less in calves fed greater levels of MR. Results from these studies show that large amounts of MR fed preweaning may further impair fiber digestion as the calf ages. Excessive feeding of CP to lactating cows and growing replacement heifers has been shown to increase fecal and urinary N, which can cause environmental problems (Wilkerson et al., 1997). These high feeding rates of milk and MR may also have an effect on N utilization and preweaning nutrient digestion in the calf. The objective of this experiment was to determine N utilization, preweaning nutrient digestibility, and growth effects in calves fed diets varying in the amount of protein and the amount of MR fed. The hypothesis was that calves fed a conventional control MR will consume more starter throughout the preweaning period and be more N efficient compared with calves fed a moderately high protein MR.",

All 24 calves underwent the digestibility phase when they were 36 to 42 d of age. Chromium oxide was dosed at 2 g/d and split into 2 doses to be administered in gelatin capsules. Capsules were given orally twice daily at 0730 and 1930 h for 7 d. Feed samples were taken on d 2 through 5, and ort samples were taken on d 3 through 6. Starter and orts were composited over the sampling days. Milk replacer samples were retained. Calves consumed all MR provided, resulting in 0 MR orts.

(2016), that observed calves consuming up to 0.9 to 1.3 kg DM of MR daily during the preweaning period gained more weight, had greater skeletal growth, and were more efficient than calves fed approximately 0.5 kg DM of MR. As shown in\nFigure 1, we found a significant treatment by week interaction for starter intake that resulted in an overall treatment effect. Overall, calves on the accelerated feeding programs consumed less starter than conventionally fed calves, which was attributed to the greater difference in starter intake during wk 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the preweaning period. In this study, calves fed AGG and MOD consumed only about 50% of starter that the CON-fed calves consumed during the preweaning period. Starter intake of AGG- and MOD-fed calves increased substantially during the weaning week (wk 7) when MR was reduced and during the postweaning week (wk 8) when MR was removed. This could be due to a highly nutrient dense MR fed at a high volume fulfilling most of the nutrient requirements of the calf, leaving little desire to eat starter. This can be correlated with lesser rumen development, as was seen in significant treatment by week interactions for BHB concentrations during the 56-d trial (\nFigure 2). Studies have suggested that circulating BHB levels may be an indicator of rumen epithelial development and starter intake in preweaned calves (Quigley et al., 1991; Deelen et al., 2016). Quigley et al. (1991) observed that total blood concentrations of VFA were greater in calves weaned early and that blood VFA responded rapidly to dry feed intake. Khan et al. (2011) concluded that increasing BHB concentrations in the blood as calves aged was mainly due to a shift in the sources of physiological fuel during the transition from liquid to solid diets. Control-fed calves had greater BHB concentrations throughout this study because they were consuming a significantly greater amount of starter in the preweaning period compared with the calves fed the moderately high protein MR (Figures 1 and 2). Dry matter intakes were similar among treatments (P\n = 0.92); however, there was a trend for a treatment by week interaction (P\n = 0.06;\nFigure 3).",

Those authors attributed the difference to the nutrient density being greater in the high-protein MR (17% solids) and likely causing an osmolality effect that, combined with greater tissue accretion, may have driven calves to drink more water. Calves on the current study consumed less MR and the MR was reconstituted to only 13% solids.",

There was a slight decrease in ADG for the AGG-fed calves during wk 6, which could be due to calves being measured only once a week, and 6 of the 8 calves on AGG were weighed 1 or 2 d after the afternoon feeding of MR had ceased. The calves were weaned based on age, whereas measurements were taken only on Mondays or Thursdays and not based on age. During the preweaning period, AGG- and MOD-fed calves had greater ADG but did not maintain this advantage during the weaning and postweaning weeks. Cowles et al. (2006) observed that calves fed up to approximately 1.3 kg DM of MR daily had ADG <20% of calves fed 0.44 kg DM of MR daily during the weaning week. The stress of weaning was less pronounced in the current study because of lower MR intakes and greater starter intakes of AGG- and MOD-fed calves compared with those in Cowles et al. (2006). Cowles et al. (2006) concluded that calves fed the intensified feeding regimen consumed less starter throughout the entire study, but had greater DMI, ADG, and gain-to-feed ratios during the preweaning period, but conventionally fed calves had greater gain-to-feed ratios during weaning. Their results showed that even though the conventionally fed heifers did not capitalize on early fast growth during the preweaning period, they were able to compensate in BW by d 63. Calves fed MOD and AGG on the current study did not maintain their weight advantage postweaning and this might be an example of compensatory growth occurring in the limit-MR-fed heifers (LaCasse et al., 1994). We found no differences in ADG or feed efficiency among treatments in the weaning and postweaning weeks, which could have been due to the lower intake of starter of calves fed MOD and AGG in the preweaning period that likely reduced the growth and feed efficiency of those calves later in the study. Calves fed MOD and AGG had a rapid increase of starter intake during the weaning week (wk 7) and postweaning week (wk 8), which could be associated with those calves accumulating more digesta and filling of the gut that calves fed CON already had; thus, their BW gain was artificially high.",

Calves in the current study were fed a starter with 20.7% CP on a DM basis, and a greater protein in this starter may have been beneficial to help increase starter intake for MOD- and AGG-fed calves. Also, having longer periods to gradually wean calves from larger intakes of MR can help overcome the stress of weaning and growth slump in calves fed large amounts of MR. Sweeney et al. (2010) evaluated starter intake using 4 weaning methods and found that calves on the 10-d weaning program had the greatest advantage because they did not lose weight during the weaning phase and weighed as much as the calves weaned abruptly.",

However, those earlier experiments determined nutrient digestibilities after calves were weaned, whereas in the current study, calves were still being fed MR. Hill et al. (2010) observed reduced DM and OM digestibility in the immediate 3 d postweaning with calves fed up to 1.1 kg DM of MR daily. In the current study, calves fed AGG and MOD had greater nutrient digestibility for percentage DM, starch, fat, and OM (P\n < 0.05) and tended to be greater for CP, ADF, and NDF (P\n < 0.10) compared with the CON-fed calves. This could be due to CON calves consuming 50% more starter, which is not as easy to digest. The quantities of nutrients digested per unit of BW were similar among all treatments except that AGG-fed calves had greater fat digested per unit of BW compared with MOD and CON. This was because the AGG calves had greater intake of fat per kilogram of BW during the preweaning period (P\n < 0.05). Hill et al. (2009) fed 0.66 kg DM of MR per calf daily that contained 14, 17, 20, or 23% fat and determined preweaning nutrient digestibility through chromium oxide. Results showed that preweaning apparent digestibility of DM, OM, fat, and NFC were linearly reduced as fat increased from 14 to 23%, which agrees with the current study. Calves fed AGG and MOD had MR containing 18% fat compared with 20% fat in the CON fed calves.",

Results from the N utilization phase showed that AGG and MOD treatments had similar but lower N efficiency than CON calves. This could be due to AGG and MOD calves having greater urine volume and thereby, greater combined urine N output compared with CON. Calves fed AGG and MOD did not utilize dietary N as efficiently as calves fed CON. Blome et al. (2003) determined N balance measurements during wk 3 and 4 of the experimental period and showed that retained N increased linearly (P\n < 0.001) as dietary CP increased. In that study, treatments were isocaloric MR (12.5% solids) fed at 12% of BW that contained 16.1, 18.5, 22.9, or 25.8% CP and no starter was offered. Calves in the current study had similar N retention values but AGG and MOD had lower N efficiency values. Estimates of N excretion from preweaned calves fed these high feeding rates of milk and MR are vital to evaluate the economic and environmental impacts of aggressive feeding programs (Wilkerson et al., 1997).",

Blome et al.

The serum urea N concentrations in the current study increased over the duration of the study in all heifers; however, no differences were noted among treatments. It is possible that CON-fed calves had more endogenous protein breakdown than AGG- or MOD-fed calves and they were also consuming more starter, indicating greater digestion of starter by the rumen microbiota, resulting in an increase in ammonia concentrations in the rumen.",

However, these studies did not calculate N efficiency, but we may conclude a lower N efficiency with greater CP and MR volumes based on the results of the current study.",

The over-feeding of CP in MOD- and AGG-fed calves increased urinary N output, which can have economic and environmental impacts. Over the 56-d study, BW and hip height gain were greater for calves fed MOD and AGG compared with CON. Serum BHB concentrations were greater in CON compared with MOD and AGG calves throughout the study. Dairy producers could use serum BHB concentrations as an easy indicator of rumen development in their calves. Data from our study indicate that calves fed amounts of MR over approximately 669 g of DM of a higher-protein milk replacer will result in lower N efficiency and reduced rumen development.",
