The military consider disaster and event planning as normal and this strategic organisational role spreads to military medicine and on to civil medicine. As the military roll out field hospital capability across Europe, we face the stark possibility and probability of a different form of medicine with mass decision-making and the reality of harsh resourcebased discussions.

Rationing is a feature of medicine that we have learnt to cope with, including rationing of procedures, but we manage this in normal practice taking criticism in our stride as we drive forward with a huge volume of research stimulating knowledge.
