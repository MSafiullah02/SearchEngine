The phylogenetic tree showed that all sequences clustered into seven distinct groups sharing\\74 % nt identity. Three consisted of avian, primate, and rodent hepatitis viruses and corresponded to the approved species listed in the Ninth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) from 2011 [8] (Fig. 1) . The bat-associated orthohepadnaviruses identified in Myanmar, Panama, and Gabon [2, 3] and in this study were genetically diverse and classified into four distinct groups (Fig. 1) . Comparisons of the full genome sequence of PEPR with those of BtHVs showed that sequence identity ranged from 60 % (with TBHBV) to 73 % (with HBHBV), and around 63 % with primate and rodent hepatitis viruses. Notably, PEPR was only 70 % identical to BtHVs in Myanmar, showing wide genetic heterogeneity. Although PEPR in Yunnan and HBHBV from Gabon both originated from Hipposideros spp., they shared only 73 % nt sequence identity; i.e., less than within both the primate hepatitis virus group (e.g., HBV and WMHBV; *80 %) and the rodent hepatitis virus group (e.g., WHV and GSHV; *85 %) [8] . These results show that BtHVs of wide genetic diversity exist within the genus Orthohepadnavirus, differing according to the bat genus or species and therefore requiring classification into different species.",
