Seasonal factors including time of discharge in relation to autumn and winter and physiological factors including the presence of pulmonary and neurological disability, as well as birthweight and young age at time of infection, all contribute to this increased risk.17 Even in the absence of chronic lung disease, infants born preterm but at later gestation remain at increased risk of hospital re\u2010admission.18\n",
