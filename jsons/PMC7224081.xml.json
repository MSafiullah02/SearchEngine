            "text": "Obesity is defined as abnormal and excessive fat accumulation at levels to disrupt health [1]. Lifestyle changes like diet and exercise and medical treatment, in addition to surgical interventions, are frequently used for treatment of obesity [2]. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a new approach for surgical treatment of morbid obesity [3]. With the increase in surgical interventions for obesity treatment, it is necessary to take more care for anesthesia management of these patients [4]. Obese patients have increased possibility of difficult intubation, in addition to displaying more unwanted effects on the respiratory system, compared with normal patients [5, 6]. Obesity is an important respiratory risk factor as it causes reduced functional residual capacity, compliance and oxygenation in terms of respiratory functions before and after both surgery and anesthesia, in addition to causing a tendency for atelectasis [7, 8]. Reduced functional residual capacity causes airway closure in situations with delayed endotracheal intubation and obese patients in the supine position become rapidly desaturated. Additionally, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and obstructive sleep apnea should be carefully questioned [9].",

            "text": "Intraperitoneal administration of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas for laparoscopic surgeries frequently increases intraabdominal pressure, pushing the diaphragm upwards and causing compression of the lungs. The lungs which are already susceptible to atelectasis due to general anesthesia experience increased severity of this effect during laparoscopy [10]. The amelioration of atelectasis developing during general anesthesia for obese patients is slower after the operation compared with nonobese patients. Atelectasis is fully resorbed 24 h after the end of the surgical procedure for nonobese patients, while atelectasis was shown to continue in obese patients at this point [11]. One of the most important aims of anesthesia management during operations on obese patients is to keep the airway and alveoli open during respiration [12]. The techniques of keeping airway pressure high for a duration to open atelectatic areas with the \u201crecruitment maneuver\u201d (RM) and positive expiration end pressure (PEEP) may reduce atelectasis and increase oxygenation [13].",

When analyzing findings obtained in the study, the IBM SPSS version 20 (IBM SPSS, Turkey) program was used for statistical analysis. A statistical power analysis was performed for sample size estimation, based on data from published study, Whalen et al. [14]. In the present study, effect size was estimated as 0.77, alpha was defined as 0.05, and power as 0.90, the projected sample size needed with this effect size (GPower 3.1) is approximately N = 58. A total of 29 patients would be required in each group for this simplest between group comparisons. When assessing study data, fit of parameters to normal distribution was evaluated with the Shapiro-Wilk test. When assessing study data, descriptive statistical methods (mean, standard deviation, frequency) were used. For comparison of quantitative data with parameters showing normal distribution, two groups were compared with the student t test, while comparison of two groups without normal distribution used the Mann-Whitney U test. Analysis of more than two measurements obtained in a single group for values without normal distribution used the Friedman test. Significance was assessed at p < 0.05 level. After the Friedman test, two-way comparisons of within-group measurements used the Wilcoxon signed ranks test to identify the difference. For blood gas measurements, significance for 5 measurements with a total of 10 two-way comparisons was evaluated at the p < 0.005 level and for respiratory mechanics, significance for 4 measurements with a total of 6 two-way comparisons was evaluated at p < 0.008 level.",

            "text": "There is no guideline with definite rules for ventilation strategies in obese patients. However, in the literature, PEEP applied after the recruitment maneuver and less than 80% FiO2 administration methods recommended to maintain physiological oxygenation [15, 16]. Lung-protective ventilation strategy (aproximately 8 ml kg\u22121 tidal volume and administered using estimated true body weight), PEEP administration, and alveolar recruitment maneuvers prevent atelectasis and positively affect intraoperative gas exchange which prevents the development of hypoxemia [12, 17]. High PEEP administration prevents the decrease in lung volume at the end of expirium formed by increased intraabdominal pressure and in this way is reported to have positive effects on respiratory mechanics, gas exchange, and PaO2 values in morbidly obese patients [18, 19]. A variety of studies have reported that administration of PEEP with the RM ensures better oxygenation and compliance compared with patients with only PEEP applied [20\u201324]. With the aim of investigating the effects of PEEP and recruitment, there are studies performed by CT or MR imaging for each patient and evaluated according to the results of these imaging methods [25\u201327]. Two studies by Rothen et al. [26, 27] administered at least 40 cmH2O pressure for 7\u20138 s duration and observed that all atelectatic lung tissues opened, there was a marked reduction in the amount of shunt and oxygenation significantly improved. Henzler et al. [28] in an animal study performed the recruitment maneuver with 45 cmH2O pressure for 40 s and found the RM provided an increase in ventilation of weakly ventilated lung volumes. In our study, we attempted to determine the efficacy of PEEP and RM using respiratory mechanics values and arterial blood gas measurements due to the cost increase caused by these imaging methods and the technical difficulties of performing CT and MR imaging for obese patients. We used PEEP and the RM together. Talab et al. [29] stated there was better oxygenation, less atelectasis, and less postoperative respiratory complications with no barotrauma encountered in the group with 10 cmH2O PEEP and 40 cmH2O recruitment procedure for 7\u20138 s. Golparvar et al. [30] performed in their study in 3 groups; multiple deep breathing maneuvers, PEEP, and both. They reported that 40 cmH2O with 5 multiple deep breathing was less effective than only PEEP administration or both used together. In our study, during the operation, PEEP administrated with 8 cmH2O at the beginning before insufflation lasted until the end of the operation, while the RM was performed 5 min after desufflation with 40 cmH2O pressure for 40 s duration. We used 100% oxygen only during the RM and as part of this maneuver for only 40 s. This is the limitation of our study. Although we used this FiO2 value, there was no difference between the groups in the T4 measurements performed at the 15th min after desufluation. T5 was the 30th min measurement after extubation and the difference between the two groups appeared in this measurement. This difference was more relevant with the pressure and duration we used. In fact, in one study, recruitment maneuver with low oxygen concentration has been shown to be more effective for oxygenation. [31] We found that the PaO2 value in the recruitment group was significantly high compared with the control group at T5. Hemmes et al. [32] administered high PEEP (12 cmH2O) to obese patients undergoing open abdominal surgery and stated it was not protective in terms of postoperative pulmonary complications. They stated that for intraoperative protective ventilation strategy, it is necessary to ensure low TV and low PEEP (2 cmH2O) without recruitment. Our study group underwent laparoscopic surgery and there are studies showing that due to the negative effects on lung dynamics, our patients were more susceptible to atelectasis development [7, 8, 10]. Findings during open surgery may be different from laparoscopic surgery. As a result, we applied relatively high PEEP along with the RM in our study.",

[34] investigated that blood gas analysis during laparoscopic surgery with increased intraabdominal pressure and CO2 insufflation decreases in arterial pH and increases in PaCO2 values due to CO2 retention. When we assessed pH, HCO3, and PaCO2 data in our study, we did not identify a difference between the two groups for pH values; however, we determined a decrease pH values at T2, T3, and T4 in both groups compared with the T1 pH value. In our study, there was no difference between the two groups in terms of HCO3 values. We did not identify any difference between the groups in terms of PaCO2 values during surgery. However, the PaCO2 value in the recruitment group examined in blood gases at T5 was low compared with the control group PaCO2 value (within normal limits). With pneumoperitoneum, PaCO2 values increase, while this value decreases after pneumoperitoneum and we identified that this was significant in the recruitment group.",

In laparoscopic surgery, PIP, Raw, and Pplateau increase, compliance decreases [35\u201338]. After desufflation, PIP and Pplateau decrease and compliance increases; however, it was shown to be 14% reduced compared with the value before insufflation [38]. It is proposed that the RM performed after desufflation in laparoscopic surgery is effective to completely regain lung compliance [35]. According to the data obtained in our study, we think the RM performed with PEEP has greater positive effects on compliance. When Raw is investigated, contrary to previous studies [36], we found Raw reduced during surgery. PIP values in both groups increased with insufflation, and we identified they regressed to values before pneumoperitoneum with desufflation. Based on the findings from Raw and PIP measurements, we concluded that 8 cmH2O PEEP administration is beneficial during laparoscopy of obese patients.",
