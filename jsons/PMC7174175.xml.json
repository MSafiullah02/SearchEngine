In light of the numbers infected with the virus, and the strain it was placing on health systems and societies in virtually every country in the world, many governments enacted emergency legislation as part of their response to the pandemic. Some countries included emergency mental health legislation in their package of measures to address the unprecedented situation brought about by the virus. In Ireland, the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act, 2020 was passed with some speed through the Irish parliament and signed by the president on 27 March, with a commencement date of 30 March for the provisions relating to mental health (Section 1(2)(b)).",

There is also a large financial aid package to allow the government to contribute to wage packets during the emergency and a series of amendments to the Mental Health Act, 2001.",

Other jurisdictions specifically reviewed include England, Scotland, Victoria and New South Wales.\nThe suggestion put forward to the group members was that a single-person review board with a high-level legal qualification who perhaps would operate on a full-time basis might not just offer an alternative structure to the current one in operation, but would allow the sole person to develop particular \u2018judicial\u2019 expertise in this field while still having a medical report prepared for him/her by an independent consultant psychiatrist. While members saw certain merits in this proposal, the fact that the state of Victoria in Australia seems to be the only jurisdiction which has operated a one-person review board system did not offer high hopes that this was the way of the future. Victoria, in fact, has recently decided to return to a three-person model\u2026\nOn that basis and in the absence of any compelling reasons for change the group recommends that there should be no change in the current composition of review boards at this time. However, this question should be re-examined in any future review of the mental health legislation (Expert Group on the Review of the Mental Health Act, 2001, 2015; p.45).\n",

It is also not clear to what extent Ireland's Mental Health Commission will need to constitute one-person as opposed to three-person tribunals, as this will only become apparent as the public health emergency unfolds. All of these matters will require careful monitoring and study, and it is to be hoped that all efforts will be made to minimise any dilution of, or delay to, the review process.",
