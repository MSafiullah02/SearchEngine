            "text": "Pandemic influenza is a global health threat. In an outbreak, there is a need for new countermeasures that can be rapidly implemented. Plasma therapy has been used experimentally for the past 100 years to treat severe infectious diseases: diphtheria in the 1890s; Spanish flu pandemic of 1917\u201318; severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003; the Ebola epidemic in west Africa in 2014\u201315; and, most recently, Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2014\u201316. A meta-analysis of eight non-randomised studies of convalescent blood products during the 1917\u201318 influenza pandemic calculated a case-fatality rate of 16% among 336 treated participants compared with 37% among 1219 controls.1 A cohort study of 93 participants with severe H1N1 influenza demonstrated lower mortality in the treatment group receiving H1N1 convalescent plasma versus the control group who received standard care (20\u00b70% vs 54\u00b78%; p=0\u00b701),2 although mortality in the control group was higher than expected for comparable severity of illness.3, 4, 5, 6 Despite these encouraging data, no randomised controlled trial of immune plasma for severe influenza has ever been done. Suggested reasons are that these studies are expensive and complex, working with experimental blood products is hard for many blood establishments, this intervention cannot be commercialised, and there is a reluctance to use blood products due to perceived associated risks. In an effort to more rigorously assess the role of immune plasma in the treatment of severe influenza, we did a randomised controlled trial in a non-pandemic setting in participants with respiratory compromise due to influenza.",

            "text": "\nResearch in context\nEvidence before this study\nWe searched PubMed in October, 2009, for studies of immune plasma for the treatment of influenza and other respiratory viral diseases. A meta-analysis of previous cohort studies during the 1918 influenza pandemic showed a case-fatality rate of 16% among participants treated with plasma, serum, or whole blood compared with 37% among controls. However, the exclusions, details of the intervention (eg, antibody titre), and structured outcome assessments in these studies are difficult to assess. In 2009, a cohort study with convalescent plasma in the treatment of pandemic H1N1 influenza resulted in a mortality of 20% in the treatment group versus 54% the control group. However, mortality in the control group in this study was higher than expected raising the concern for bias in patient selection. No previous randomised studies were identified for the treatment of influenza with convalescent plasma.\nAdded value of this study\nTo our knowledge, our study is the first randomised treatment study to investigate the use of immune plasma in the treatment of severe seasonal influenza. Our findings showed that patients treated with convalescent plasma had a trend that did not reach statistical significance towards faster resolution of their respiratory illness (as measured by tachypnoea or hypoxia), as well as improvement in multiple secondary endpoints (clinical status, hospital stay duration, intensive care unit requirement, and mechanical ventilation). Our safety data showed the intervention was well tolerated with no evidence of worsening influenza disease or other adverse effects from the plasma administration.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nThe evidence from this study shows that immune plasma might be an effective treatment for the treatment of severe influenza. Due to the small number of participants in this study, and the lack of treatment blinding, these findings should be confirmed in a randomised and blinded clinical trial.\n",

The study was initially restricted to onset of illness within 7 days of enrolment but was subsequently revised to allow participants to be enrolled regardless of onset time if there was active viral replication (as evidenced by a positive diagnostic test). The study initially enrolled participants with influenza H1N1 only, but was amended to also include influenza H3N2 and B. Participants were excluded if ABO-compatible plasma was not available, if they had received investigational antivirals in the previous 2 weeks, if they had a history of any allergic reactions to blood products, if they had medical conditions in which they could not tolerate 500 mL volume of plasma infusion, or if there was a clinical suspicion that the cause of acute illness was primarily due to a condition other than active influenza virus replication (eg, primarily a bacterial superinfection).",

The secondary endpoints included: incidence and duration of clinical symptoms and fever, time to resolution of all symptoms and fever, in-hospital and 28 day mortality, duration of hospital stay, number of admissions and duration of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), incidence and duration of supplemental oxygen, incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, incidence and duration of requiring mechanical ventilation, and disposition (home with no health care, home with health care, transferred to long-term care facility, hospital stay ongoing at day 28, discharged to hospice care, deceased) after the last hospital discharge. All secondary analysis including subgroups were prespecified in a formal statistical analysis plan, with the exception of the six step ordinal scale of clinical status at day 7, which was developed for a separate anti-influenza intravenous hyperimmune immunoglobulin study (NCT02287467) and was used post-hoc in this study.",

Due to the higher than expected loss to follow-up, sensitivity analysis was done with follow-up censored at last available assessment with sufficient respiratory status data (p=0\u00b7086). Six participants who were randomly assigned to receive plasma resolved the tachypnoea and hypoxia present at screening by the time of baseline (before receiving plasma), as compared with one participant who received standard care. With these participants excluded from the analysis, 22 (61%) of 36 participants in the primary efficacy population randomly assigned to receive plasma had resolution of tachypnoea and hypoxia by day 28, compared with 23 (52%) of 44 controls (p=0\u00b726). The benefit was primarily reported in participants who were enrolled within 4 days of symptoms (treatment by subgroup interaction p=0\u00b7038; figure 2B). As the participants randomly assigned to standard care had slightly more severe disease at baseline, to assess the influence of these baseline differences, analysis was done stratified by use of oxygen, mechanical ventilation, ICU requirement, and presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome. All stratified analyses showed similar results as in the primary analysis (stratified log rank p=0\u00b7019\u20130\u00b712; appendix).",

            "text": "The study has several limitations. There were limited previous data by which an effect size could be determined for sample size calculations and, in the end, this study was underpowered. The unblinded design was another limitation of the study. Potential placebos (eg, saline with albumin) were debated during protocol development, although even with elaborate blinding schemes the study team is unlikely to have been effectively blinded. Ultimately, it was concluded that incorporation of a placebo should await a larger, more definitive trial. One unintended consequence of the decision to have an unblinded study design was the observation that losses to follow-up seemed to be somewhat higher in the participants who received standard care as compared with those who received plasma. After consenting but then being informed that no specific study treatment would be provided, we suspect that participants who received standard care were less motivated to complete all study visits. However, this loss to follow-up did not compromise our ability to ascertain data for the primary endpoint.",

Due to the association of age and pregnancy with outcomes in H1N1 influenza, these were chosen as the primary stratification categories for randomisation. With the limited sample size, we were concerned that additional stratification could have led to incomplete filling of blocks (over stratification) and subsequent imbalances. The differences in the severity of illness likely also account for the higher viral burden in nasal and oropharyngeal swabs at baseline in the standard care group.",

Despite engagement of established investigators in infectious diseases, intensive care, and emergency medicine at 29 academic medical centres, enrolment and random assignment of 98 participants took more than 4 years. Major challenges included a low incidence of influenza illness in some years of the study and the scarcity of experience of most blood establishments with using plasma as an investigational product. Some participants, families, and even treating physicians also expressed reluctance in use of a human blood product for a disease such as influenza, in which morbidity and mortality is often underappreciated. There were additional challenges unique to the investigational product, including the moving target of antigenic drift in circulating influenza subtypes and the need to match this evolution over time with contemporaneous plasma, and the comparatively short shelf life of plasma units necessitating frequent replenishment of expiring units.",

Additionally, other endpoints might be suggestive of improved outcome in these patients. Given the need for better therapies for influenza, as well as the need to have strategies in place to rapidly launch effective therapeutic countermeasures for diseases of this type, it is of critical importance to accurately determine the efficacy of immune plasma. With these considerations, we believe that this approach should be further studied in a larger randomised trial. As noted, such a trial is presently underway.",
