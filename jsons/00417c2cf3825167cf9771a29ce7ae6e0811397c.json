As one of the emerging countries in the world, China is becoming more and more active in the scientific community and collaborations. The total number of full-time equivalent researchers engaged in science and technology in China was estimated to be about 4.19 million in 2018, ranking number one in the world. 2 In 2019, China enrolled 917,000 postgraduate students, with the total number of postgraduate students at school increasing to 2.864 million. 3 All these R&D personnel and students will greatly benefit from Open Access to pub Open Science can also benefit China's transition to an innovation-based economy. As the second largest economy in the world since 2010, China's GDP increased to 99.09 trillion RMB in 2019. 3 According to the 2019 Bloomberg innovation index, China ranked 16 th of the world's most innovative countries, moving from 19 th in 2018. In recent 10 years, China has been pursuing quality of economic growth over speed, underpinning its ongoing transition toward more innovation-driven growth. Traditionally, there has long been a great disconnection between research-driven universities/institutions and application-driven companies. By increasing the research capacity and visibility, facilitating rapid access to novel data and software resources, and creating new opportunities to interact with and contribute to the ongoing communal projects, Open Science may make research collaboration easier for researchers to bond with one another, and especially strengthen the links between universities/institutions and companies. 4 Background Open Science is a movement aiming to remove the barriers to sharing any kind of research outputs, resources, methods or tools, at any stage of the research process. Open Science embodies a number of aspects, the core of which is Open ",

The principle of \"publish or perish\" makes scientists keep their ideas secret until published, which may consequently cause secrecy and taciturnity in the scientific community. Through sharing knowledge with others, developing a mutual comprehension of problems, and working collaboratively on research projects, Open Science intends to boost knowledge transfer and provides Open Educational Resources for teaching and learning, including software-based tools and services, and licenses that allow for open development and re-use of content, tools and services [2]. Universities, research institutes, foundations and publishers offer different types of training and consultancy services to students and researchers, to help them develop the skills that are necessary for Open Science practices. In October 2015, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development published a report on \"Making Open Science a Reality\", addressing the importance of incentive mechanisms and clear legal frameworks for Open Science at both national and international levels [3]. In April 2018, European Commission published \"Recommendation on Access to and Preservation of Scientific Information\" and required the member states to set and implement clear policies about Open Science and Open Access [4].

Some publishers and leading journals have made COVID-19 research outputs free to readers. It is advocated that all the literature, data, clinical trial and other resources related to COVID-19 should be open for free access. So far, there are still some significant barriers and challenges to Open Science, such as intellectual property right, technology and cost. However, it is a belief that Open Science based on sharing and collaboration is not only an inherent need of innovation, but also a responsibility: scientific endeavor, innovation and creativity should benefit the global development for both developed and developing countries. Developing countries are facing various development challenges, such as health inequity, environmental contamination, climate change, food insecurity, education quality. World Health Organization reported in 2005 that more than half of medical institutions have no subscriptions to scientific journals in countries with an annual GNP per capita of less than USD 1 000. This means that Open Access to publications, open research data, open source software, open collaboration, open peer review, open notebooks and open educational resources are especially important for education and research in developing countries.",
