            "text": "The first receptor described for HMGB1 is the RAGE, a multifunctional transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily [63] (see also Part II, Sect. 5.2.8). Signalling through RAGE results in activation of the transcription factors NF-kB and MAPKs [64] (compare Part VI, Sect. 22.3.9). In particular, activation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) MAPK pathway is crucial in mediating cell migration, tumor proliferation and invasion, and expression of MMPs. Indeed, the HMGB1 \u2192 RAGE axis is critically involved in the recruitment and migration of cells, directly by inducing expression of adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) [65], or indirectly by causing secretion of chemokines, in particular CXCL12, which in turn forms a heterocomplex with HMGB1 [66] (for chemokines and adhesion molecules, see Part VI, Sects. 22.5.11 and 22.5.12).",

This category of danger signals includes molecules that are regarded as the \"prototypical\" or \"historical\" DAMPs which marked the start of the era of DAMPs; the HMGB1 and HSPs can be found among these molecules but also proteins of entirely different nature, structure, and function such as MHC Class I chain-related proteins.",

The various intracellular native compounds including organelles and cell debris operate in the extracellular milieu as constitutively expressed native DAMPs, denoted here as Class IA DAMPs (for ACD and RN, compare Part V, Chap. 17 and Sect. 19.3) . Most of these DAMPs such as HMGB1 [2] [3] [4] , HSPs [5] [6] [7] , S100A8/A9 proteins [8, 9] , and NAs [10, 11] can be directly sensed via binding to a variety of PRMs. These PRMs in terms of \"classical\" PRRs include TLRs, CLRs, NLRs, ALRs along with other DNA receptors such as cGAS, and RAGE (for informing articles, see Refs. [10, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] ). Many of these Class IA DAMPs signal danger to the surrounding PRMs-bearing cells such as leukocytes and phagocytes to trigger sterile inflammation and to PRM-bearing DCs to elicit adaptive immunity. In addition, some of these Class IA DAMPs were shown to activate sessile PRM-bearing cells of the innate immune system such as fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and epithelial and vascular cells, thereby promoting repair and regeneration, for example, wound-healing processes following infectious/sterile injury-induced inflammation (for relevant articles, see Refs. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] ). In the following, those DAMPs will be described which are predominantly or exclusively recognized by TLRs such as TLR4 and TLR2 (but also by RAGE) as well as NA receptor molecules such as RIG-I and cGAS. Historically, HSP72 plays a particular role as such a DAMP, because descriptions of endogenous agonists of TLRs up-regulated in vivo during sterile tissue injury started with this molecule [28] . Up to now, however, HMGB1 is the by far most investigated DAMP. Thus, these two molecules will be addressed in more detail.",

            "text": "The high mobility group (HMG) nuclear proteins were discovered in 1973 in an effort to better define the specific regulators of gene expression. Regarding their quick migration during electrophoresis, they were named after this property [29] . As a member of a subfamily of the HMG proteins, HMGB1 is both a nucleus-resident factor released following cell membrane rupture and-under certain conditions-a secreted (modified) protein (see also below, Sect. 14.3.3). As an intracellular nonhistone chromatin-associated protein, it operates as a DNA chaperone under homeostatic conditions by binding the DNA double helix transiently and bending it reversibly. As a DNA chaperone, the protein enhances the formation of nucleosomes; contributes to the assembly of site-specific DNA binding proteins to their cognate binding sites within chromatin, including transcription factors that underwind DNA upon binding; and is involved in transcription, replication, and DNA repair. Indeed, HMGB1 is an extremely mobile protein. The entire pool of HMGB1 roams the nucleus, resting on a specific DNA site for only fractions of a second. The transient binding to chromatin enables HMGB1 to perform its activities in transcription and other nuclear transactions [30] . The native HMGB1 is constitutively expressed in almost all cell types, and to operate as a DAMP, it is passively released following ACD or RN. Of note, in terms of an inducible DAMP, HMGB1 is actively secreted in a processed/modified state during severe stress (for competent articles and reviews, see Refs. [31] [32] [33] [34] ). Clearly, the history of the development of the molecule and current knowledge of its function are fascinating. During recent years, the number of investigations on HMGB1 is steadily growing. Justifiably, today, one can state that HMGB1 is apparently the best characterized DAMP. By utilizing comprehensive review articles as a guide (see Refs. [30, 31, [35] [36] [37] ), a brief summary of the properties of this most relevant DAMP is depicted in the following.",

The tail interacts with the HMG boxes and may modulate their intermolecular interactions (for relevant articles, see [34, [39] [40] [41] [42] ) ( Fig. 12.1 ). These separate structural motifs seem to function in different ways when isolated from HMGB1. Thus, several studies have identified the B-box domain as important for many of the proinflammatory properties of HMGB1 including cytokine release.

Already in 2004, TLR4 and TLR2 were reported to be such candidates [67] : Murine macrophage cell lines transfected with dominant-negative constructs of TLR2 and TLR4 were found to show a decreased activation on stimulation with HMGB1. In particular, a decrease in NF-\u03baB-dependent reporter gene expression after transfection with dominant-negative constructs to TLR2, TLR4, or both, demonstrated that TLR2 and TLR4 are both involved in HMGB1-induced activation of NF-\u03baB [67] . Most crucial evidence in support of the notion that injuryinduced HMGB1 is recognized by TLR4 came from the early seminal experiment performed by the Pittsburgh group [68] : TLR4-defective mice (C3H/Hej mice) exhibited less damage in the hepatic postischemic reperfusion model than did wildtype mice (C3H/HeOuj mice). Anti-HMGB1 antibody failed to provide protection in C3H/Hej mice but successfully reduced damage in C3H/Ouj mice. These Pittsburgh results demonstrated that HMGB1 is an early mediator of injury and inflammation in liver IRI and implicates TLR4 as one of the receptors that are involved in the process [68] .",

            "text": "Once in the extracellular milieu, HMGB1 signals danger to the surrounding cells, triggers inflammation, and activates innate and adaptive immunity by interacting with multiple receptors mentioned above. Intriguingly, however, these various functions of HMGB1 vary depending on the redox state of this prototypical DAMP. Thus, the redox status of HMGB1 reportedly distinguishes its cytokine-inducing and chemokine activity. In fact, a large body of evidence has been published demonstrating that the redox state of cysteines modulates the binding of HMGB1 to its receptors and consequently its activities (reviewed by Venereau et al. [31] ). The puzzle is based on three cysteines in positions 23, 45, and 106 possessed by HMGB1: C23 and C45 can form a disulfide bond, and C106 is unpaired. These cysteines are modified by redox reactions, causing three isoforms called fully reduced HMGB1 for the all-thiol form, disulfide HMGB1 for the partially oxidized one, and sulfonyl HMGB1 for the terminally oxidized form [74] (Fig. 12. 2). Fully reduced HMGB1 has sole chemokine activity by creating a complex with the chemokine CXCL12, which binds with increased affinity to its CXCR4 receptor to promote recruitment of inflammatory cells to sites of damaged tissues [66] . Conversely, the myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD-2), an extracellular adaptor of TLR4, binds specifically to disulfide HMGB1 but not to the other redox forms, thereby triggering the up regulation of chemokines and cytokines [75] (for MD-2, see Part VI, Sect. 22.3.3.1). Of note, interaction with MD-2 also requires the third cysteine, in the fully reduced form. Thus, the disulfide bond between C23 and C45 qualifies HMGB1 as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, whereas further cysteine oxidation to sulfonates abolishes both the chemoattractant and pro-inflammatory activities of HMGB1 [45] . Also, reduced HMGB1 protein promotes autophagy, whereas oxidized HMGB1 fosters apoptosis (for autophagy and apoptosis, compare Part V, Sects. 18.2 and 19.2). Further and for clinicians essential to know, a correlation between the presence of the disulfide HMGB1 and the onset of pathologies could be clinically shown, for example, concerning brain injury, liver damage, myositis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (reviewed in [31] ). Remarkably, disulfide HMGB1, and not the reduced form, contributes to nociceptive signal transmission via activation of TLR4 [76] (for nociceptors sensing exogenous DAMPs, compare below, Chap. 15).",

In fact, acetylation of Lys 75 (K73 in humans) in Sox 2 was shown to promote transport of the molecule from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, indicating that acetylation of HMG boxes might serve as a transport signal for this entire class of proteins [38, 78] (for secreted HMGB1 acting as an inducible DAMP, see below Sect. 14.3.3).",

            "text": "All organisms respond to heat by synthesizing a group of stress proteins called heat shock proteins (HSPs). These highly conserved biomolecules exist ubiquitously throughout the evolutionary scale, from archaebacteria to eubacteria, from plants to animals, and from animals to humans [81] . They are abundant across species in nearly all subcellular compartments. They are both constitutively and inducibly expressed. After a sudden rise in temperature of a few degrees, all cells immediately, but transiently, activate a small number of specific genes. Some of these encode HSPs. First observed in 1962, chromosomal \"puffing\" owing to the \"unwrapping\" of chromatin for gene activation occurred after the exposure of isolated salivary glands of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to temperatures slightly above physiological levels [82] . By 1974, \"puffing\" was noted to be accompanied by high-level expression of a unique set of HSPs [83] . Investigations on Drosophila showed that each of four members of a small HSP family was induced during development in response to heat stress via cell-specific enhancers in the gene promoter regions [84] . Investigations into members of different species soon revealed that cells produce neosynthesized proteins when exposed not only to an abrupt increase in temperature but also to other diverse toxic stress situations such as alterations in the intracellular redox environment or exposure to oxidants, heavy metals, alcohol, xenobiotics, or viral infection. For this reason, they are referred to as \"stress proteins\" and are divided into different families according to their molecular size, for example, HSP100, HSP90, HSP70, HSP60, HSP40, and HSP20. One of the most intensively studied protein families is the 70-kDa HSP70 [85] (Fig. 12.1 ). As major stress-inducible proteins, the HSP70 family consists of ubiquitous HSP73 and of HSP72, which is inducible by heat shock, oxidative stress, and infection.",

These investigators showed that exposure of DCs to necrotic but not apoptotic cells resulted in the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB and subsequent maturation of DCs. In more recent times, these early studies were confirmed by several groups. For example, in in vitro experiments on cell lysates, HSP70 released from necrotic monocytes/macrophages was shown to function as an endogenous danger signal to augment the pro-inflammatory responses in monocytes/macrophage [88] . In other lines of studies, HSP70 was found to be passively released from necrotic human prostate carcinoma cells lines treated with hyperthermia [89] . Together, there is sufficient evidence documenting passive release of HSPs form necrotic cells.",

Fine-tuning of TLR signaling in amplitude, space, time, and character is a key aspect of inflammatory reactions in health, homeostasis, and pathology. What is becoming more and more apparent is that positive and negative regulators within immune responses do not work as a single entity, but rather, similar to an orchestral score, each component is reliant on its other tools such as HSP70 to produce a harmonious melody instead of a crashing cacophony.\"",

Of note, several S100 family members have been shown to be released from necrotic cells to acting as critical DAMPs in the promotion of inflammatory responses. The most prominent proteins include S100A8 (also known as calgranulin A or MRP-8), S100A9 (calgranulin B or MRP-14, which can form a dimer with S100A8 extracellularly), S100A12 (calgranulin C or EN-RAGE), and S100B protein (reviewed in [9, [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] ). The proteins S100A8 and A100A9 are expressed in cells of myeloid origin, including neutrophils and monocytes as well as keratinocytes and epithelial cells under inflammatory conditions. Both proteins can complex, and as a heterocomplex of S100A8/A9, they are often called calprotectin. This complex is highly abundant in human neutrophils and constitutes a large part of the total protein content of these cells. The protein S100A12 binds both zinc and copper and is highly abundant in innate immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils [117] . The protein S100B is expressed in astrocytes, certain neuronal populations, Schwann cells, melanocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes, skeletal myofibers and associated satellite cells and DCs and lymphocyte populations, and a few other cell types [118] .",

Notably, recent studies were published indicating that CD14 is a coreceptor of TLR4 in the S100A9-induced cytokine response [121] . On the other hand, S100A12 and S100B are reportedly recognized by RAGE, whereby S100A12 has also recently been found to bind to TLR4 to induce monocyte activation [122] . Following recognition, both interactions are known to result in NF-\u03baB-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [123, 124] . Interestingly, a model was recently proposed, whereby conformational flexibility in the RAGE receptor allows the adoption of a binding conformation for interaction with the stable hydrophobic groove on the surface of S100B [124] . Besides TLR4 and RAGE, other receptors have been identified to sense S100 proteins including GPCRs, scavenger receptors, or heparan sulfate (HS) PGs and N-glycans (reviewed in [125] ) (for GPCRs and scavenger receptors, see Part II, Sects. 5.3.3 and 5.3.5).",

Thus, DNA is sensed by TLR9, whereby this receptor recognizes a specific sequence pattern, that is, unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (CpG-DNA) called the \"CpG motif,\" a hexamer, containing a cytosine triphosphate deoxynucleotide (\"C\") followed by a guanine triphosphate deoxynucleotide (\"G\"). The \"p\" refers to the phosphodiester link between consecutive nucleotides. Long dsRNA is sensed by TLR3, a receptor that was the first bona fide PRR identified as a sensor for dsRNA. TLR3 is not present in the cytosol of healthy cells and thus is [128] [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] regarded as receptor sensing dsRNA coming from outside the cell. Further, TLR7 senses even short RNA, preferentially double-stranded and containing guanine and uridine. The TLR8 functions as receptors for uridine-rich RNA molecules which are likely to be degraded from ssRNA fragments. Notably, TLR7 is expressed in B cells, pDCs, and macrophages, whereas TLR8 is expressed in macrophages and DCs. Of note, recent attention has been paid to an emerging role of the processing of NAs and TLRs as a mandatory prerequisite to allowing initiation of innate immune responses to NAs (reviewed in [132] ). In fact, NA degradation by DNases and RNases has been recognized as a key role in preventing hazardous activation of NA sensors that may become deleterious for the host. For example, DNA degradation by lysosomal (and cytoplasmic) DNases is now known to prevent deleterious homeostatic activation of cytosolic DNA-sensing pathways. As a matter of fact, crude NAs are not effective for stimulating NA receptors. Intriguingly, lysosomal TLRs are also dependent on NA processing in lysosomes. Thus, digestion of dsDNA by DNase II was shown to be required for TLR9 response to ssDNA. Furthermore, TLR7 and TLR8 respond to ribonucleosides and ODNs, instead of ssRNA itself, indicating a requirement for RNA processing. Nucleic acid-sensing TLRs themselves need to be processed by lysosomal proteases. Without processing, TLR8 and TLR9 were found to fail to form dimers. Together, as stressed [132] , \"the processing of NAs and TLRs has the key role in keeping NA sensors responsive to microbial NAs without inducing hazardous responses to endogenous NAs.\"",

Hard to believe but already more than 100 years ago, the Polish-German surgeon von Mikulicz-Radecki treated patients with severe surgical peritoneal infections with NAs and other similar substances. The aim was to induce massive hyperleukocytosis, which would increase natural resistance to the bacteria involved. Von Mikulicz-Radecki reported his clinical trial findings at the 33rd Congress of the German Society of Surgeons in 1904 (cited in [135] ). Many years later, one of the first reports was published that historically documented the immunostimulatory potential of DNA, in fact, depending on a TLR-independent phenomenon [136] . Still, the mechanism of action of NAs was not understood until a couple of years ago. Today it is known that upon recognition of NAs, the endolysosomal TLRs and cytosolic sensors activate signalling cascades that culminate in the production of type I IFNs, which primarily include numerous subtypes of IFN-\u03b1 and a single IFN-\u03b2, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1\u03b2. Type I IFNs then-now acting as DAMPs-induce a vast plethora of antiviral genes through the activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. Moreover, NAs have been shown to be involved in promoting sterile inflammation upon non-pathogen-mediated traumatic tissue injury [137] . The scenarios are described in more detail in Part VI, Sects. 22.3.3, 22.3.6, and 22.3.7.",

[57, [138] [139] [140] [141] [142] [143] [144] ). As known, in eukaryotic cells, DNA is packaged into chromatin, the basic repeating unit of which is a nucleosome. A nucleosome consists of 147 bp nucleotides wrapped around a histone octamer, which is composed of two copies each of histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Nucleosomes are packaged into progressively higher-order structures to form chromosomes ultimately. Notably, unstructured NH2-terminal histone tails that protrude from the nucleosome are subject to covalent chemical modifications, which impact chromatin organization and function (for more details, see Part VI, Sect. 24.2.2, and Fig. 24 .1).",

In addition to histone-induced pro-inflammatory innate immune responses via TLR2 and TLR4, subsequent experiments on an in vivo model of hepatic IRI demonstrated that TLR9 KO mice were protected from histone-mediated IRI; these studies encouraged the authors to propose that exogenous histones may have acted as a cofactor that amplified the TLR9-mediated signalling brought about by endogenous circulating DNA released from dying cells [139] . However, as discussed elsewhere [142, 144] , these unexpected results might have been influenced by remnant DNA bound to histones, thereby reflecting a DNA \u2192 TLR9dependent DAMP effect.",

Released during periods of cell death and immune activation, histone, nucleosomes and NETs induce cytotoxicity by altering cell membrane permeability to calcium ions, activating TLRs on innate immune cells, stimulating NLRP3 inflammasome and complement systems, resulting in a sterile pro-inflammatory environment. There are three distinct pharmacodynamic approaches to target histone-mediated inflammation, by reducing the release, neutralising or blocking histone signal transduction. Although these approaches have proven to provide significant protection from mortality in animal models of acute organ injury, further research is necessary to warrant their safe application in a clinical setting.\"",

Nevertheless, IL-33 was found to be able to associate with chromatin by tethering to histones H2A/H2B, via a short chromatinbinding motif, located in its N-terminal nuclear domain [150] . Biologically active full-length IL-33 can be immediately released in the extracellular space after traumatic cell death (necrotic cell death or mechanical injury) enabling instant alarm or danger signalling without the need for further processing or modification (see Refs. [151] [152] [153] [154] ). Once released, the cytokine has been reported to operating as a canonical DAMP [155] ; regarding this function, other authors denoted IL-33 as an \"alarmin\" [156] or \"dual function-alarmin\" [157] ). Following emission, IL-33 elicits extracellular effects by binding to the suppressor of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) receptor (see Part VI, Sect. 22.5.6.4). Although full-length IL-33 is biologically active, cleavage generates mature forms of IL-33 with up to tenfold more biologically active compared to the full-length protein [158] .",

In addition, after binding to FPs, these receptors promote pro-inflammatory responses including cell adhesion, directed migration, granule release, and superoxide production.

More recently reported supportive studies on microglia-like cells suggest that the inflammatory effect of cytochrome C is at least partially mediated by TLR4-triggered signalling [175] .

In mammals, F-actin is exposed on and released by necrotic cells that have lost plasma membrane integrity to bind to the PRM DNGR-1, a receptor that is expressed selectively by DCs [179] . Like Dectin-1, DNGR-1 is a transmembrane CLR that samples the extracellular and endosomal space and signals via Src and Syk (see Part II, Sect. 5.2.7.3). Following phosphorylation by Src-family kinases, DNGR-1 recruits the tyrosine kinase Syk to promote DC cross-presentation of dead cell-associated antigens.",

For example, the molecule elicits multiple inflammatory responses, activating leukocytes and their migration, up-regulating adhesion molecule and cytokine expression, and augmenting oxidant production and lipid peroxidation [183] [184] [185] . Of note, heme, but not porphyrins without iron, was demonstrated to operate as a DAMP promoting the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in LPS-primed macrophages [186] (see Part VI, Sect. 22.4.2).

A typical feature of members of this class of DAMPs is the fact that they do not directly activate inflammasomes via physical binding to NLRP3 but act through the promotion of molecular homeostatic perturbations in an innate immune cell which are then sensed by NLRP3 (compare Part II, Sect. 5.2.3.3). Such DAMPs include eATP at millimolar concentrations, K + ionophores [189] and crystalline/particulate substances (e.g., MSU, cholesterol crystals, silica, alum), or other factors that cause lysosomal destabilization [190, 191] . As said, these activators are indirectly sensed without direct binding to NLRP3 to trigger inflammasome assembly, IL-1\u03b2/IL-18 release, and pyroptosis [192] [193] [194] [195] (for pyroptosis, see Part V, Sect. 19.3.4).",

For example, in studies on pressure-disrupted or freeze-thaw-treated necrotic B16 cells, mitochondria-derived ATP was shown to be capable of activating the NLRP3 inflammasome [198] . Once released into the extracellular space, ATP like ADP is rapidly metabolized to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which in turn is metabolized to adenosine. This nucleotide phosphohydrolysis involves a two-step enzymatic process regulated by ectoenzymes. In the first step, ATP and ADP are both converted to AMP through the ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (CD39) (reviewed in [199] ). To function as a DAMP, eATP initially triggers signalling through the activation of purinergic P2 receptors [200] . As outlined in Part II, Sect. 5.3.4.3, these receptors have a widespread expression throughout different tissues and are involved in innate and adaptive immune responses. As also mentioned in Sect. 5.3.4.3, P2 purinoceptors can be further subdivided into metabotropic P2YRs, which are G-protein-coupled, and ionotropic P2XRs, which are non-selective nucleotide-gated ion channels. Of note, it is the P2X7 receptor through which eATP leads indirectly to canonical NLRP3 activation under involvement of hemichannels of pannexin-1 [192, 194, 201, 202] .",

As a regular constituent of healthy cells, where it is believed to possess antioxidant properties, uric acid is released into biological fluids such as blood. In patients suffering from hyperuricaemia as a consequence of too much intake of purines and/or genetic predisposition, uric acid saturates body fluids and may be converted to MSU crystal when deposited in joints and other tissues, thereby causing gout and other inflammatory diseases (reviewed by Rock et al.

In 2003, uric acid was identified by the Rock group as a major DAMP and later on shown in mice to promote an acute inflammatory response when released as crystals from dying cells [205, 206] . Once released into the extracellular space and engulfed by phagocytosing cells such as macrophages, the MSU crystals/ particles are sensed by NLRP3 resulting in activation and assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. It is suggested that the MSU particles cause the rupture or leakage of lysosomes or phagosomes associated with release of cathepsin B into the cytosol, thereby leading to molecular perturbations of the cell sensed as dyshomeostatic [192, 200, 203] DAMPs by NLRP3 [190, 207, 208] . This process has been known as \"frustrated phagocytosis\" wherein the phagocytosed crystals cannot be engulfed entirely or digested, thereby leading to changes in the structure of the Golgi complexes like fragmentation and reorganization of Golgi membranes [209] . These perturbations reflect bona fide dyshomeostatic DAMPs which are genuinely sensed by NLRP3. Yet, other mechanisms are also discussed to contribute to NLRP3 activation, such as MSU crystal-promoted K + efflux reflecting also molecular perturbations that are, as mentioned above, thought to be involved indirectly in ATP sensing (for dyshomeostatic DAMPs, see below, Sect. 13.4.5; for mechanisms of NLRP3 activation, including particulate-mediated activation, see Part VI, Sect. 22.4.2.2).",

This implies that in terms of uncontrolled inflammatory pathways, this effect can lead to both acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. As mentioned above, gout disease can be regarded as a classical disorder which can be associated with clinical manifestation of a number of co-morbid conditions including renal disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, lipid disorders, and respiratory symptoms (reviewed in [204] ). Interestingly, it has been speculated that these comorbidities may pathogenetically be elicited by uric acid in its role as a DAMPas other DAMPs of this class like cholesterol do, which were shown to contribute to other sterile inflammatory disorders such as atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome. Future clinical trials will probably give an answer to this burning issue. Together, uric acid metamorphoses into a potent immunostimulatory DAMP when it undergoes a phase change by nucleating into crystals of MSU that obviously-when ingested by phagocytes as a particle-causes intracellular perturbations to indirectly lead to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Pathogenetically, the gout disease is regarded as a typical disorder induced via this sketched pathway. Whether or not gout-associated comorbidities are induced by the same path is an interesting speculation but remains to be proven in future clinical trials.",

Other lines of studies in rodents confirmed these observations by uncovering further metabolic stress-induced lipid species acting as NLRP3-activating DAMPs. Thus, in a working model in which free fatty acids activate inflammasome-dependent IL-1\u03b2 secretion from myeloid cells, the investigators found that that elevated fatty acid caused by a high-fat diet was capable of activating the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages via a ROSdependent signalling pathway. Remarkable from these experiments was the observation that IL-1\u03b2 induced by fatty acid prevents normal insulin signalling in multiple insulin target tissues, ultimately resulting in insulin resistance [227] . Doubtlessly, for clinicians, this finding explicitly explains the development of insulin resistance in obese patients, at least partially. Also, in experiments on murine LPS-treated macrophages, it could be demonstrated that ingested palmitate, a saturated fatty acid ester, activates the NLRP3 inflammasome resulting in a lysosome-dependent release of IL-1\u03b2 [228] . In their conclusion, the authors also discuss a potential mechanistic role of lysosome destabilization and cathepsin B.",

In other words, it is this \"double DAMPs axis\" that activates the NLRP3 inflammasome to play a leading role in mounting both infective and sterile inflammatory milieus.",

Thus, clinical studies in patients suffering from RA, SLE, and lung cancer showed that CALR in its soluble form circulates in the periphery, in lung cancer patients before and-in much higher concentration-after chemotherapy. As such, the DAMP was proposed to use clinically as a potential diagnostic biomarker in lung cancer patients [255] . Subsequent studies of the same group provided evidence suggesting the scavenger receptor SRA to sense the soluble form of CALR, thereby triggering macrophage activation [256] .

As mentioned above, the DAMP serves as a phagocytic signal on cancer cells following induction of ICD, thereby contributing to the maturation of immunogenic DCs, which elicit-via efficient cross-presentation of TAAs-a potent anti-tumor CD8 + T cell response. This scenario makes tumors susceptible to immunotherapy-based anticancer strategies. For this reason, CALR is now regarded as one of the most potent target DAMPs for developing new anticancer therapeutics (more details of ICD will be presented in Volume 2).",

Though these DAMPs are characterized by numerous and highly variable genetic, structural, and biochemical features, they all belong to the major histocompatibility complex Class I gene superfamily (MHC-I-related proteins) and bind to a single, invariant, receptor, the NKG2D receptor (compare Part II, Sect. . The receptor NKG2D serves as a major recognition receptor for this class of DAMPs to detect and eliminate cells, which are stressed as transformed or infectively and sterilely damaged cells. On healthy cells, these endogenous IB-2 DAMPs (also called NKG2D ligands) are expressed at a low level only, but their expression is markedly induced on such stressed cells, whereby they translocate (probably from the stressed ER [262] ) to the plasma membrane to get anchored and exposed. Two families of IB-2 DAMPs, mainly expressed on epithelial cells and ECs, have been identified in humans: (1) the stress-inducible molecules non-conventional MICA and MICB, which could be considered prototypical members of this class, and (2) the stress-inducible UL16 binding proteins 1, 2, and 3 (ULBPs 1, 2, 3), together with two novel members of this family, the ULBP/retinoic acid early inducible protein 1 (RAET1) gene cluster, ULBP4/RAET1E and ULBP4/RAET1G (for reviews, see Refs.

The proteins ULBP/RAET1 seem to be less polymorphic than MICs. This may be due, however, to sampling, as fewer than 300 individuals have been sequenced.

Cell stress stimuli induce generation of these DAMPs, which are regulated at several levels of biogenesis by various types of such signals that are worked out in distressed, infected, or transformed cells. The regulatory processes have been found to occur discerned at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels. The signals that regulate the various steps of DAMP biogenesis are induced in the course of stress responses such as the oxidative stress response, the heat shock response (HSR), the DDR, and the ER stress-initiated UPR (for these stress responses, see Part V, Sects. 18.3-18.6). Thus, in a way and broader sense, they can be also regarded as DAMPs. For example, in the case of cancer, numerous independent pathways such as the DDR and the UPR (under involvement of transcription factor E2F) that are activated in proliferating cancer cells are likely to collaborate in the induction of DAMPs (for E2F, see Box 12.1). In case of infective cell injury, the HSR pathway, at least in part, has been shown to play a role in the induction of MICA and MICB at the transcriptional level. Moreover, there is some evidence suggesting that (DAMP?) \u2192 TLR-triggered activation of the transcription factors TBK1 and IRF3 is implicated in the production of these DAMPs. Sterile cell injury, such as oxidative stress, can also induce the generation of IB-2 DAMPs, although little is known concerning the underlying mechanisms. Nevertheless, there is some evidence suggesting that the DAMP OxLDL (see below, Sect. 13.3.2) sensed by TLR4 is involved in generation of members of this class of DAMPs at the transcriptional level (mostly reviewed in [270] ).",

Typical sterile tissue injuries causing passive release of HMGB1 from dying cells include ROS-mediated oxidative damage such as IRI [52, 53], traumatic lesions in patients [54-57], or chemically induced toxic liver injuries [58, 59] (reviewed by Lu et al. in Ref.[34]). As also competently examined by Lu et al.[34], HMGB1 can be passively released from cells infected by various viruses (such as West Nile, salmon anemia, dengue, and influenza viruses), indicating HMGB1 to operate as a critical mediator and amplifier of infectious tissue injury to elicit of virus-induced inflammatory diseases [60]. More recent data from studies in children suffering from enterovirus 71-induced hand, foot, and mouth disease suggest that HMGB1 is involved in the inflammatory pathogenesis of this disease and that the serum level of HMGB1 could be applied as a clinical indicator for the severity of the viral infection[61]. Another recent report presented evidence for a role of HMGB1 as a potential biomarker for severe viral hemorrhagic fevers [62].Fig. 12.1 Schematic diagram of the basic structure of HMGB1, HSP70, and S100 proteins. The molecule HMGB1 has a tripartite structure and consists of two homologous L-shaped DNAbinding domains (termed NH 2 -terminal HMG A box and central HMG B box) and a negatively charged (acidic) COOP-terminal tail. The tail interacts with the HMG boxes and may modulate their intermolecular interactions. HSP70 consists of an NH 2 -terminal nucleotide-binding domain, also termed ATP-binding domain, and a COOP-terminal protein substrate-binding domain that binds extended polypeptides. The latter domain is subdivided into a COOP-terminal \u03b1-helical subdomain providing a flexible lid of SBD\u03b2. The S100 proteins are calcium-binding proteins which are characterized by four helices (two helix-loop-helix segments), a central hinge region, and NH 2 -and COOP-terminal variable domains.
