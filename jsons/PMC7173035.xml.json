For instance, as a result of the current pandemic and restrictions on congregating through social distancing, to date in the United States, nearly 4000 American Red Cross blood drives have been canceled across the country. Hospital-based collections have been cancelled due to institutional concerns regarding donors spreading COVID-19 to hospitalized patients or vice versa. These cancellations have resulted in some 130,000 fewer blood donations in only a few weeks. More than 80% of the blood the American Red Cross collects comes from drives held at nonpermanent collection locations. According to the Chief Executive Officer of New York Blood Center, the main blood supplier for New York City, around 75% of their incoming blood supply was interrupted during the week of March 16, 2020, when schools, businesses, and religious institutions closed due to the coronavirus outbreak.5",
