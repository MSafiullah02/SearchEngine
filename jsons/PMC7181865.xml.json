            "text": "Pathogens persist within host cells, which makes them difficult to treat as they minimally interfere with the host and escape immune clearance. Viral persistence comprises chronic and latent infections, for example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpesvirus, papilloma virus, polyoma virus, hepatitis B virus, and human adenovirus (AdV)1\u20133. Viral persistence involves the restoration of homeostasis upon initial infection. The unfolded protein response (UPR) restores homeostasis upon ER stress. Enveloped viruses, including influenza virus and herpes viruses subvert the UPR for the synthesis of viral glycoproteins4\u20136. They involve three transmembrane sensors in the ER, the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6/p90), and protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK). IRE1\u03b1, ATF6, and PERK enhance the levels of the transcription factors XBP1s, ATF6/p50, and ATF4, respectively, and upregulate gene expression of chaperones and slow down protein translation restoring ER homeostasis7\u201310. IRE1\u03b1 has cytoplasmic kinase and nuclease domains. Its phosphorylation enhances ATP binding, activates the ribonuclease, and initiates the splicing of XBP1 mRNA by removing a short intron of 26 nucleotides (nt)11. Back-ligation of the spliced mRNA by the tRNA ligase Rtcb generates XBP1s mRNA encoding the functional transcription factor XBP1s12. During the lytic cycle, Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus activates all three UPR sensors, and inhibits the downstream transcription of host genes by yet unknown mechanisms reviewed in ref. 13.",

To explore the role of IRE1\u03b1 in AdV infection, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate IRE1\u03b1-knockout HeLa cells (HeLa I-KO). A guide RNA targeting exon 2 yielded a KO phenotype affecting all three allelic copies of IRE1\u03b1 (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). Two IRE1\u03b1 alleles were edited by frameshift mutations and one had a 15-nt in-frame deletion. HeLa I-KO was significantly less susceptible to AdV-C5 infection than HeLa or HeLa I-KO ectopically expressing IRE1\u03b1 from a lentivirus, as shown by AdV late protein VI expression and virus production (Fig. 1a). Infection inhibition was not due to reduced virus entry, as the incoming vDNA was effectively delivered into the nucleus 2.5 hpi39 (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Akin to IRE1\u03b1 KO, the IRE1\u03b1 nuclease inhibitor 4\u00b58C40 reduced viral replication, as shown by quantitative (q)-PCR (Fig. 1a).",

We assessed the levels of BiP\u2013IRE1\u03b1 by immunoprecipitation experiments of Flag-hIRE1\u03b1 expressed in IRE1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs at near-endogenous levels43. The co-immunoprecipitation data, western blots, and rt-PCR measurements of E1A mRNA showed that BiP dissociated from IRE1\u03b1 at 7 hpi, when only low amounts of E1A protein were present, and neither 19K protein nor XBP1 splicing were detectable (Fig. 2d). This was in contrast to conventional UPR induced by DTT where BiP\u2013IRE1\u03b1 dissociation was rapidly followed by XBP1 splicing (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Similar results were obtained in HeLa I-KO cells transduced with lentivirus encoding Flag-hIRE1\u03b1, where BiP dissociated from IRE1\u03b1 at 4 h post AdV-C2 infection (Supplementary Fig. 2c, d). In MEFs, AdV-C5 lacking E1A and E1B ORFs did not dissociate BiP from IRE1\u03b1, in contrast to a mutant lacking the 19K ORF (Fig. 2e). Notably, AdV-C5 infection did not increase the levels of BiP and IRE1\u03b1, unlike treatment with DTT, which massively increased the BiP levels (Fig. 2f). Accordingly, the ectopic expression of BiP did not attenuate the induction of XBP1s by AdV-C2, unlike thapsigargin treatment (Supplementary Fig. 2e, f), consistent with earlier reports46. Collectively, the data indicate that AdV activates IRE1\u03b1 in a non-canonical manner, whereby BiP dissociates long before XBP1 splicing, and independent of 19K.",

This finding was in accordance with the RNAi data against 19K, where a pool of more than a dozen synthetic dsRNAs targeting 19K strongly reduced the induction of XBP1s, and also reduced the expression of E1A, while control RNAi pools against E4-Orf4 had no effect on E1A (Supplementary Fig. 3e).",

To identify the domain that triggered IRE1\u03b1 activation, we expressed 19K chimeras with transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains from murine MHC-I H-2Kd in HeLa cells35. All three chimeras had comparable expression levels and induced XBP1s, but 19K lacking the LD only weakly induced XBP1s (Fig. 3d, and Supplementary Fig. 3g). The human MHC class-I antigen binding defective M87A 19K mutant35 strongly induced XBP1s, indicating that MHC-I binding was not required for XBP1s induction (Fig. 3d). The expression of the C2 19K-LD alone with or without a C-terminal HDEL motif activated IRE1\u03b1 to comparable levels as the full-length protein, and much more effectively than the D8 19K-LD or full-length 19K (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 3h, i). The AdV-C2/5\u201319K glycoproteins have a highly conserved LD of 122 and 123 amino acids, 92% of which are identical, whereas the D8-LD of 119 amino acids is 30% identical with the C2/5-LDs (Supplementary Fig. 3j). This underscores that 19K alone or in context of AdV-C infection induces the phosphorylation of endogenous IRE1\u03b1 followed by XBP1 splicing. This suggests the formation of IRE1\u03b1 oligomers triggering trans-autophosphorylation and allosteric activation of the endonuclease domain9.",

Immunoprecipitation of 19K by the monoclonal IgG antibody 3A9 significantly enriched IRE1\u03b1 compared with pulldowns with a control IgG, suggesting a complex of IRE1\u03b1 and 19K. We next tested if the lumenal domains of C2-19 K and IRE1\u03b1 interacted in the ER. Tripartite split-GFP fluorescence complementation assays were used in cells expressing the 19K-LD and IRE1\u03b1 or PERK-LD. The Flag-IRE1\u03b1 containing the 20-amino-acid domain GFP10 at the C terminus and the C2 19K-LD with the C-terminal 18 amino acids of GFP11 gave rise to reticular ER-like green fluorescence signals in transfected cells expressing signal sequence containing GFP1\u20139 with a HDEL ER retention signal (Fig. 4a, b). Green fluorescence signals colocalized with the anti-19K and anti-Flag immunostainings validating the GFP complementation signals. In contrast, no green fluorescence was obtained with Flag-tagged PERK-GFP10-LD, although both 19K and PERK localized in reticular cytoplasmic patterns, akin to IRE1\u03b1, indicating selectivity of complementation. The 19K-LD of AdV-D8 (D8 19K-GFP11-LD) gave only faint GFP complementation with SS-GFP1\u20139-HDEL, but signals with SS-GFP1\u201310-HDEL as strong as C2 19K-GFP11-HDEL, indicating robust expression of both C2 and D8 19K-GFP11-HDEL fusion proteins (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c). Collectively, the data show that the C2 19K-LD closely and specifically associates with IRE1\u03b1, activates IRE1\u03b1, and triggers XBP1 splicing.",

Lentivirus-mediated transduction of human XBP1s gave a dose-dependent increase of XBP1s in HeLa I-KO cells, and increased AdV-C2 infection (Fig. 5a). This was confirmed by qrt-PCR measurements of E1A mRNA and 19K protein levels (Fig. 5a). The XBP1s enhancement of E1A was dependent on the activation domain of XBP1s, as demonstrated by expression of mutant murine XBP1s lacking the activation domain due to a premature stop codon after the leucine zipper domain (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Both wild-type and mutant XBP1s mRNAs were expressed similarly, although we could only detect wild-type XBP1s in western blots with an antibody against the C-terminal region containing the transactivation domain. The ectopic expression of XBP1s enhanced the E1A protein levels under the viral E1A-e/p in HeLa and HDF-TERT cells (Fig. 5b). The application of the IRE1 nuclease inhibitor 4\u00b58C reduced E1A expression, indicating that both XBP1s and IRE1\u03b1 boost E1A expression in the absence of other AdV gene products (Fig. 5b). In contrast to XBP1s and IRE1\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 reduced E1A expression. Notably, the XBP1s-binding sites on the E1A-e/p are separated from the E2F co-repressor-binding sites controlled by IFN-\u03b336. The enhancement of E1A expression by IRE1\u03b1 and XBP1s was further confirmed by small-interfering RNAs targeting IRE1\u03b1 and XBP1, which reduced the lentivirus-based E1A expression in both untreated and IFN-\u03b3-treated HeLa or HDF-TERT cells (Fig. 5b). The treatment of HDF-TERT cells with IFN-\u03b3 also suppressed AdV-C5 long-term infection, as indicated by strongly reduced expression of the E4-GFP-Orf4 fusion protein (Supplementary Fig. 5c), in agreement with the literature36.",

To test if XBP1s bound to the E1A-, E4-, and ML promoters, ChIP analysis of AdV-C2-infected cells was performed. XBP1s antibodies enriched the E1A, MLP, and E4-e/p regions fivefold to sevenfold over isotype control antibodies (Fig. 6b). The deletion of the four E1A XBP1s-binding sites in E1A significantly reduced E1A expression in HDF-TERT cells from dl309_\u039463\u201395 compared with dl309, most prominently, if XBP1s was overexpressed (Fig. 6c). This result was supported by site-specific mutagenesis of the five XBP1s-binding sites (ACGT, CCACG, and CACG boxes) yielding AdV-C5-XBP1s-mut, which showed strongly attenuated E1A expression compared with AdV-C5 (Fig. 6c). In accordance, the vDNA copy numbers were four logs reduced in dl309_\u039463\u2013195-infected HDF-TERT cells compared with dl309 at 216 hpi (Supplementary Fig. 6a).

The E1A-wild-type viruses dl309 and AdV-C5 were used as controls. HDF-TERT cells were seeded onto xCELLigence plates, treated with IFN-\u03b3, infected 36 h later, and incubated in the presence of IFN-\u03b3 until 22.5 days post seeding, followed by IFN-\u03b3 washout and incubation for another 13.5 days. Multiplicities of infection (MOI) of both viruses was chosen such that similar cytopathic effects occurred without IFN-\u03b3 treatment at 120 h post seeding (Fig. 7c, right panel, see also E1A expression data in Supplementary Fig. 7b). While dl309 and AdV-C5 infections led to cell death after 12.5 and 11 days, respectively, in the presence of intermittent amounts of IFN-\u03b3, the dl309_\u039463\u2013195 and the AdV-C5-XBP1s-mut-infected cells remained viable throughout the course of the experiment to about 36 days (870-h time point), akin to uninfected cells (Fig. 7c). Under IFN-\u03b3, the titers of dl309_\u039463\u2013195 and AdV-C5-XBP1s-mut did not rise (middle panel), and the cells remained viable as shown by phase-contrast microscopy and impedance measurements using xCELLigence, indicative of only low levels of persistence, whereas titers of dl309 or AdV-C5 increased by 102\u2212103-fold, indicating high persistence of E1A normal viruses (Fig. 7c). Importantly, upon removal of IFN-\u03b3 22.5 days post seeding, the dl309_\u039463\u2013195 and AdV-C5-XBP1s-mut titers increased several hundred to a thousand-fold 36 days post seeding, while the dl309 or AdV-C5 infections lead to rapid cell death. These results demonstrate that the XBP1s-binding sites in the E1A-e/p support the persistence under IFN-\u03b3. The data show that noncanonical activation of IRE1\u03b1 maintains a feedforward loop between the ER and the nucleus, gives rise to E1A and 19K expression, maintains AdV persistence, and boosts lytic infection (Fig. 7d).",

The ensuing 19K expression and association of the 19K-LD with the IRE1\u03b1-LD induced IRE1\u03b1 phosphorylation and XBP1 mRNA splicing yielding XBP1s.

This may be akin to a subset of ER-targeted cellular mRNAs, signal recognition particle RNA, ribosomal RNAs, or transfer RNAs, which can directly activate IRE1\u03b164. The noncanonical UPR induction by AdV contrasts the known cellular and viral UPR inductions. Lumenal peptides can bind to both BiP and IRE1\u03b1, for example, the 8ab protein of SARS-coronavirus triggers the transition of IRE1\u03b1 from a closed to an open conformation, and leads to IRE1\u03b1 oligomerization65. Consequences of IRE1\u03b1 activation comprise inflammatory reactions in conjunction with activation of pattern recognition receptors66. The LD of C2 19K and IRE1\u03b1 was in close association based on immunoprecipitations and split-GFP complementation assays. This mode of IRE1\u03b1 activation contrasts with a recent lipid stress activation model of IRE1\u03b1, where BiP binding to IRE1\u03b1 is not affected43,67. Importantly, IRE1\u03b1 activation by C2 19K was independent of 19K interaction with MHC-I in the ER lumen, indicating that MHC-I sequestration and prevention of CTL-mediated killing of infected cells are not required for IRE1\u03b1 activation.",

Lytic infection could be rescued by overexpression of XBP1s in IRE1\u03b1 KO cells. More specifically, XBP1s was found in a complex with the E1A-e/p in infected cells, and boosted E1A (and also 19K) expression, and lytic infection. The XBP1s-binding sites on the E1A-e/p are distantly located from the E2F-Rb repressor-binding sites36, a configuration that allows for coregulation by repressors and stimulators, which we show here is crucial in AdV persistently infected cells in the presence of IFN-\u03b3. The concept of coregulation by activators and repressors is found with herpes viruses and HIV, where transcriptional coregulation occurs during persistence69,70. In accordance, the IRE1\u03b1 nuclease inhibitor 4\u00b58C, which reduces XBP1s, reduced AdV-C5 persistence in HDF-TERT cells under IFN-\u03b3.",

This supports both lytic and persistent infection of HDF-TERT cells, as indicated by AdV-C5 mutants lacking functional XBP1s-binding sites in the E1A-e/p. In nonlymphoid cells, the E3 promoter, which lacks XBP1s-binding sites is controlled by E1A, and in lymphoid cells, it is E1A-independent but NF-\u03baB dependent71. This may lead to cell death. For example, TNF\u03b1 exposure induces ER stress, IRE1\u03b1, and NF-\u03baB activation, and exacerbates death signaling through the TNF receptor 1, involving c-JUN N-terminal kinase72. If and how AdV antagonizes this signaling pathway is unknown. Alternatively, other host transcription factors could be involved in E3 regulation. For example, SP1, which is induced by XBP1s60 has 29 predicted binding sites in the E3 promoter, and could enhance E3 transcription. Regardless of the nature of the E3 promoter regulation, the deletion of the 7.1K and 19K region in AdV-C5 reduced viral persistence in Syrian hamsters73. Our data highlight the therapeutic potential of the IRE1\u03b1 branch of the UPR, and converge on the notion that in Zika virus-infected human and mouse embryos, the UPR was observed in the cerebral cortex of postmortem fetuses, and the IRE1\u03b1 nuclease inhibitor 4\u00b58C reduced the microcephaly frequency74. In conclusion, the selective activation of IRE1\u03b1 by 19K provides an environment conducive for AdV persistence, and supports the lytic cycle under conditions of impaired immunity.",

A polyclonal population of both cell lines expressing Cas9 was selected with puromycin (2 \u00b5g/ml), and single clones were isolated from HeLa-ATCC. For selection of clonal population, a polyclonal population was seeded at high dilution in a 15-cm dish and allowed to grow into several sparse clones. Using circular rings, small populations from single clones were trypsinized, collected, and seeded on 96-well clear-bottom plates for expansion. After several weeks, DNA from the growing clonal population was extracted, and using primers flanking the target site of Cas9 on exon 2 of IRE1\u03b1, PCR was performed, and fragments were ligated into plasmid vector (Bluescript). Positive clones were sequenced, aligned to the wild-type mammalian IRE1\u03b1 locus (NCBI identifier NC_000017.11 region 64039142\u201364132469), and the resulting mutations were identified. As IRE1\u03b1 is triploid in HeLa cells80, sequencing of the clone used in this study revealed three distinct mutations, namely insertion of A, frameshift deletion of 23 nt, and in-frame deletion of 15 nt (Supplementary Fig. 1b).",

A similar experiment was carried out in HDF-TERT cells including IFN-\u03b3 to suppress the E1A promoter/enhancer expressed from a lentivirus vector (middle panel). E1A expression in HDF-TERT cells is reduced by RNA interference against IRE1\u03b1 and XBP1, but not by nontargeting siRNA (siNeg1, 20 nM siPools, right panel).
