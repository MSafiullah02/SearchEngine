Airborne disease transmission, the processes governing it, and the development of protective measures against it, are less understood than transmission via water, food, arthropod vectors, and direct contact with infected individuals. Disease transmission among humans and animals often involves either direct contact with an infected individual or transport across very short distances; however, pathogen transmission over longer distances can also occur. The SARS outbreak within the Amoy Gardens housing complex in Hong Kong [1] was spread between apartments by sewer main gases drawn in by improperly sized ventilation fans and poorly maintained drains.",

In pork and poultry production, biosecurity measures for preventing the introduction of pathogens into animal confinement buildings primarily protect against disease spread through direct contact between animals and from pathogen-contaminated surfaces. PRRS and avian and porcine influenza are two examples of high impact diseases for which biosecurity measures have been implemented to prevent airborne transmission. The virus that causes PRRS is understood to survive transmission through the atmosphere in greater numbers when atmospheric conditions are cool, damp, or cloudy [2]. Long-term changes in climate and their influences on infectious disease outbreaks vary by route of transmission and are highly uncertain [3]. While increasing vector populations with increasing annual average temperature and precipitation could increase vector-borne transmission, the influences of changing meteorological conditions on airborne transmission of pathogens are unclear.",

            "text": "In contexts where humans or animals move freely, the potential for disease transmission through direct contact is greater, reducing the importance of airborne transmission and greatly limiting the utility of airborne pathogen inactivation. However, where airborne transmission is or is suspected of being an important transmission route, few mitigation technologies exist. Disinfection by UV irradiation requires UV doses involving a combination of radiative fluxes and exposure times that have been established [4], which are difficult to implement in air. Upper-room UV irradiation relies on natural air circulation patterns within a room to transport airborne pathogens into the illumination zone of a wall-mounted, upward facing UV fixture near the ceiling. Upper room UV was proven effective in reducing TB transmission in hospital wards [5] and rubella transmission within army barracks [6]. UV germicidal irradiation (UVGI) directs UV radiation onto conventional particulate filters within ventilation systems to inactivate bacteria and viruses captured on the filter surfaces [7]; however, viruses and bacteria that migrate into the filter media or that are shielded from the UV source as subsequent particles are collected, are inactivated with lower efficiencies [7]. The US EPA concludes that there is insufficient evidence, and no standard test procedures, for assessing UVGI performance and that UVGI provides virtually no additional protection over the use of conventional HEPA filtration alone [8]. Conventional filtration presents several drawbacks, including the low fluid permeability needed for high particle collection efficiency, which inherently increases the differential pressure across the filter and promotes infiltration of untreated air into indoor spaces at partial vacuum. In buildings not constructed to an air-tight standard, this can lead to high costs of building reconstruction and retrofit.",

            "text": "Two factors govern the potential for disease transmission of airborne pathogens such as viruses and bacteria: aerosol transport and aerosol infectivity [9]. UV radiation alone only addresses aerosol infectivity and particle filtration only addresses aerosol transport. Unlike filtration and UV irradiation, non-thermal plasmas (NTPs) can address both transport (by charge-driven filtration) and infectivity (by reaction with reactive plasma species) of airborne pathogens. NTP is a result of electrical discharges within a neutral gas under atmospheric conditions and mainly consists of electrons, ions, and radicals. Unlike thermal plasma, where all constituents are in thermal equilibrium, a NTP in comparison is always in a state of non-equilibrium because the electrons with very light masses can reach higher temperatures (104\u20132.5  \u00d7  105 K) and attain higher kinetic energy (1\u201320 eV) than the rest of the NTP constituents, which are heavier and at lower temperatures [10]. On these bases, an NTP is also known as non-equilibrium plasma or cold plasma. A commonly applied NTP reactor type is the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor. DBD or silent discharge refers to the electrical discharge through a dielectric barrier, such as glass, quartz, or alumina. A high voltage AC source is commonly used in a DBD reactor, because the changing polarity of AC is essential to sustain the electrical discharge in a DBD reactor. The dominant electrical discharge mode in a DBD reactor is microdischarge, which is in a form of filaments with nanosecond lifespan. When the microdischarge reaches a dielectric barrier, the dielectric surface allows for the spreading and accumulation of the charges and thus reduces the electric field until the field is completely quenched. The use of an AC source repeats the cycle by generating microdischarge with a different electrical polarity. In studying the effectiveness of removing air pollutants such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) by NTP, Holzer et al [11] utilized a gaseous plasma generated by a DBD reactor using different dielectric barriers including glass, Al2O3, and TiO2. Kuwahara et al [12] developed a DBD reactor using polyester-laminated electrodes to evaluate the removal characteristics of odorous compounds, including NH3 and NH3 mixed with CH3CHO, by NTP. In studying oil mist-to-gas conversion, Park et al [13] developed a DBD reactor using thin copper electrodes (0.05 mm thickness) where each electrode was sandwiched in between by two dielectric plates made of alumina (1 mm thickness).",

            "text": "A packed-bed reactor provides a more efficient way of treating trace air pollutants by adding pellets between the electrodes in a corona reactor or a DBD reactor. A typical air pollutant has a concentration in the range of parts per million by volume (ppmv), so direct interactions between the electrons and air pollutants are usually negligible under ambient conditions [10]. In a packed-bed reactor, the electron-impact reactions serve as the main plasma chemistry for air pollutant decomposition [14]. By packing the pellets, electron generation takes place through partial discharges at the pellet contact points within a packed-bed reactor. More specifically, an external electric field applied between the pellets and the electrodes enables polarization, which in turn induces partial discharges and subsequently the electron-impact reactions. While a packed-bed arrangement can provide evenly distributed flows, it can also lead to a higher pressure drop across the packed-bed. Perovskite pellets, such as BaTiO3 and Al2O3 are commonly used dielectric materials for packed-bed reactors. The addition of catalytically active materials can further improve the selectivity of a packed-bed reactor. Mizuno et al [15, 16] discovered that a ferroelectric pellet packed-bed reactor was not only capable of collecting particles, but also destroying yeast cells. In studying organic solvents (e.g. MTBE, toluene, and acetone), Holzer et al [11] evaluated three packed-bed materials (i.e. glass beads, BaTiO3, and PbZrO3\u2013PbTiO3) and one catalyst (i.e. LaCoO3) using various cylindrical DBD reactors designs, which showed that the ferroelectric packed-bed reactor using BaTiO3 pellets significantly increased the conversion of MTBE and toluene to COx. Kuwahara et al [12] used a ferroelectric packed-bed reactor to study the decomposition of odorous compounds (i.e. NH3) by adding BaTiO3 pellets to the previously developed DBD reactor, which used polyester-laminated electrodes. The results showed that the DBD reactor with ferroelectric packed-bed pellets could decompose NH3 at a much faster rate than the DBD reactor alone.",

The research group found that the synergetic action of short-living plasma agents, such as hydroxyl radicals, and plasma-generated ozone, achieved the previously measured 97% in-flight inactivation of aerosolized E. coli [19]. Another research group constructed a 12 mm diameter DBD NTP device and reported  >95% inactivation of bacteria and 85%\u201398% inactivation of fungal species with a 24 W reactor energy output and a flow rate of 28.3 LPM (liters per minute) [20]. That same team examined NTP inactivation of MS2 and reported over 95% MS2 airstream inactivation with a 28 W reactor energy output at 12.5 LPM flow rate [18]. None of these research, however, examined the airstream inactivation performance of a reactor with a pack-bed feature.",

A DBD NTP reactor was constructed to treat an air stream seeded with viral aerosols. Aerosols of bacteriophage MS2 were generated by the evaporation of fine mists produced by ultrasonic atomization. Plaque assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses were conducted to determine the abundance of infective and total MS2 aerosols, respectively, in the pre- and post-treatment samples. Ultimately, the ability to remove residual ozone with carbon filters was assessed. A maximum of 2.3 log reduction of infective MS2 virus was achieved by the reactor, demonstrating NTP is a viable technology for in-flight disinfection and the prevention of airborne virus transmission.",

            "text": "The experimental apparatus (figure 1) for NTP inactivation of viral aerosols includes: (1) an induced draft (ID) fan, (2) a DBD reactor, (3) an aerosol generator, (4) a digital oscilloscope, (5) a high voltage amplifier, and (6) a digital function generator. The aerosol generator is a modified consumer-grade cool-mist humidifier (Vicks V5100-N) that piezoelectrically atomizes virus buffer solution containing MS2, a single-stranded RNA bacteriophage. A 10.2 cm (4-inch) ID fan at the end of the apparatus draws ambient air (25%\u201336% RH) into a flexible duct (8.9 cm (3.5-inch) ID and 4 m (13-ft) length), where mixing occurs between the air and the droplets, allowing for droplet evaporation and thus bioaerosol generation. The droplet evaporation process is further enhanced by the addition of a facility-supplied stream of dry compressed air (<10% RH; figure 1). The DBD reactor is powered by one of the two AC voltage amplifiers, namely a variable 0 to 20 kV (peak-to-peak) high voltage amplifier (Trek Model-610E) and a 30 kV neon transformer (France 15030 P5G-2UE ServiceMaster). The variable 0 to 20 kV high voltage amplifier is coupled with a digital function generator (BK Precision Model-4052), which outputs 60 Hz sinusoidal AC voltage. The amplifier can output applied voltage (U) signals at 1 V/1000 V and two current (I) signals, total current and return current, at 1 V/200 \u00b5A, which can be monitored directly by a digital oscilloscope (BK Precision Model-2190D). For the 30 kV neon transformer, a high voltage probe (Cal Test Electronics CT2700, 1 V/1000 V) and a Pearson current coil (Model 6585, 1V/1A) are connected to one of the power supply\u2019s high voltage electrodes (the schematic is illustrated in figure S1 in the supplementary information, available online (stacks.iop.org/JPhysD/52/255201/mmedia)), whose output signals are monitored by the digital oscilloscope. The power (P) of the reactor was therefore calculated according to the equation:\n1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n}{}\\end{document}P=1T\u222bTU\u00d7Idt\nwhere T is the period of the AC voltage. A honeycomb-structured ozone filter (figure 1; Burnett Process Inc. BP-4810) is located downstream of the reactor to remove ozone from the exhaust. Two impingers installed upstream and downstream (figure 1) of the reactor enabled the quantification of virus inactivation by the NTP reactor.",

Figure 2 is a close-up schematic of the DBD packed-bed reactor. The reactor is composed of one larger Plexiglas tube (10.2 cm (4-inch) OD, 9.5 cm (3.75-inch) ID, 20.3 cm (8-inch) length) and two smaller tubes (8.9 cm (3.5-inch) OD, 7.6 cm (3-inch) ID, 30.5 cm (12-inch) length). The smaller tubes slide freely relative to the larger tube due to a clearance of 0.3 cm (0.125-inch). Two rubber O-rings, which sit in the grooves on the OD of the smaller tube permit an air-tight sliding mechanism. As indicated in figure 2, a circular perforated brass plate is installed at the end of each sliding tube to serve as the ground electrode and to evenly distribute the inlet and outlet flow of the reactor. The design of the sliding electrode allows for packed bed depth adjustment ranging between 0.6 and 12.7 cm (0.25 and 6 inches). A brass ring (0.9 mm (0.035-inch) thickness, 2.5 cm (1-inch) width) adhered to the OD of the larger Plexiglas tube serves as the high voltage electrode for the AC high voltage supply. Two flow plugs made of styrofoam (6.35 cm (2.5-inch) OD) are positioned at the center of the reactor to direct the airflow with viral aerosols through an annular region in which the plasma is concentrated (figure 2). The DBD reactor utilizes the microdischarge generated through a dielectric barrier made of Plexiglas. The packed-bed, consisting of 500 inert borosilicate glass beads (0.6 cm (0.25-inch) diameter), further enhances the microdischarge by partial discharges at the contact points between the glass beads for effective electron-viral aerosol collisions and inactivation process.",

An insertable anemometer (Extech 407123) measured the air stream radial velocity profile ~30.5 cm (12-inch) downstream of the reactor. The pressure drops across the packed-bed NTP reactor and the ozone filter were measured by a low-pressure differential gauge (Magnehelic 2300-0). When the reactor was powered by the 0\u201320 kV variable amplifier, an oscilloscope (BK Precision Model-2190D) monitored the applied voltage and current to the packed-bed NTP reactor, from which the input and discharge power can be calculated. When the reactor was powered by the fixed 30kV transformer, the total input power consumption of the transformer was measured by an electricity power meter (P3 International P4460), and the discharge power was measured by a high voltage probe and a Pearson coil, as discussed in the experimental setup section. To ensure that collected MS2 would not be inactivated in the impinger liquid during sampling, 20 ml of 1  \u00d7  106 pfu ml\u22121 MS2-PBS solution was added into the downstream impinger, which was then connected to the downstream sampling port. The packed-bed NTP reactor was either inactivated or activated by the 20 kV voltage supply, and the effluent gas from the reactor was bubbled through the impinger liquid for 15, 30 and 45 min, after which the infectious MS2 concentrations in the impinger were assayed. Ozone generated by the packed-bed NTP reactor when energized had the potential to dissolve into sampling liquid in the downstream impinger and inactivate MS2 during and after sample collection. To quench the ozone in solution, 50 mM of anhydrous sodium sulfite (Na2SO3, Fisher Scientific BP355-500) was added into the downstream 20 ml impinger collection liquid. An ozone sensor (EcoSensors A-21ZX) measured the ozone concentration either upstream of the ozone filter (downstream of the reactor) or downstream of the filter to determine the amount of ozone generated by the pack-bed NTP reactor at various power and flow rate levels and to examine the removal efficiency of ozone by the ozone filter.",

The ozone filter was also quite porous, with a honeycomb structure that produced a pressure drop of 20 Pa at the flow rate of 170 LPM. The total pressure drop across the system was about 65 Pa at the flow rate of 170 LPM, or 0.38 Pa/LPM. It was estimated that at 170 LPM, the virus exposure time to NTP species was about 0.25 s.",

When applied voltage increased from 12 kV to 20 kV, the input power increased from 0.5 W to 1.5 W and the discharge power increased from 0.2 W to 0.6 W, 31%\u201336% of the input power (figure 4(a)). Kuwahara et al [12] reported similar differences (76%) between input and discharge power, and two other research reported that 20%\u201327% of the input power was converted to plasma discharge power in their NTP reactor [24, 25]. With the 0\u201320 kV variable amplifier, the maximum discharge power in the reactor was 0.56 W (198 J m\u22123 at 170 LPM) at 20 kV. With the fixed 30 kV neon transformer, the actual peak-to-peak voltage applied to the reactor was 28 kV and the total input power consumption was ~21 W measured by the commercial power meter.

The estimated discharge power showed a strong exponential correlation with the applied peak-to-peak voltage, no matter which power supply is used (figure 4(b)).

The concentration of infective viruses when the NTP reactor was off proved that bubbling ozone-free air through the impinger for 45 min did not inactivate the MS2 (figure 5). When the reactor was on, a 3 log reduction in the infective MS2 concentration was observed in the impinger solution over the first 15 min. This indicated that when the reactor was activated by 20 kV, the generated ozone dissolved in the impinger liquid and inactivated the sampled MS2. As the goal of these experiments was to inactivate viruses within the reactor and not in the sampling liquid downstream of the reactor, the ozone that dissolved in the downstream impinger liquid was quenched with 50 mM of anhydrous sodium sulfite. According to the measured ozone concentration and the calculated equilibrium dissolved ozone concentration in the impinger liquid (based on Henry\u2019s Law), the added sodium sulfite should be sufficient to quench all of the dissolved ozone during the packed-bed NTP inactivation tests.

The qPCR results, which reflect the total number of viruses, suggested a decrease of ~1 log between the humidifier outlet and the upstream impinger and a decrease of ~0.35 log between the upstream and downstream impingers (figure 6). The ~1 log decrease in gene copy concentrations from the humidifier outlet (position 8) to the upstream impinger (position 10), which indicates the loss of total (infectious and inactivated) viruses during atomization, may have several causes, including wall losses along the four-meter-long duct. These impacts are discussed in greater detail in Xia et al [21]. The additional 1.6 log reduction in infectious MS2 concentrations was most likely caused by inactivation during the evaporation process of the atomized MS2-PBS droplets. Based on the qPCR results, the 0.35 log decrease of infectious viruses through the packed bed when the reactor was off was not due to inactivation of viruses in the aerosols and was likely due to physical filtration of the virus by the packed bed.",

Consequently, the reactor caused a decrease of more than 2.3 log infective MS2 (2 log inactivation if excluding the 0.35 log filtration discussed above) (figure 6). In contrast, the nearly constant reduction in gene copy concentrations with and without power to the reactor suggests that the virus was inactivated, and not removed physically (figure 6). In Xia et al [21], we discuss the likely mechanisms responsible for the nearly three log reduction in infective MS2 concentration between the introduction of the aerosol at position 8 to the upstream impinger at position 10 (figure 1).",

Increasing the voltage resulted in an exponential increase in MS2 inactivation by the reactor (figure 7), when the packed-bed filtration effect (an average of 0.14 log) was subtracted. At an air flow rate of 170 LPM and 12 kV, an infective virus inactivation reduction across the reactor of 0.23 log was observed. This increased to a 0.78 log reduction at 20 kV. Inactivation of infectious agents by chemical oxidants generally follows a Chick\u2013Watson model, as illustrated by the equation below [26, 27]:\n4\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n}{}\\end{document}ln(CDCU)= \u2212kCinactnt\nwhere CD and CU are downstream and upstream infectious virus concentrations respectively, Cinact is the concentration of the inactivating agent generated by NTP, n is the coefficient of dilution (usually assumed to be 1), t is duration of treatment, and k is a kinetic constant. When the NTP reactor is operating at steady state under steady applied AC voltage, Cinact and treatment time t should remain constant. Increasing applied voltage to the NTP reactor increases the concentration of reactive ions and electrons (Cinact) in the plasma, and according to figure 7 and equation (4), Cinact should increase exponentially with increasing applied voltage. This assertion, however, needs to be justified in future plasma species measurements and analysis. Increasing the flow rate to 330 LPM, and consequently reducing the treatment time by approximately 50%, had a small impact on inactivation (figure 7), which indicates that the amount of treated air by the reactor can be increased without having a major impact on inactivation efficiency. This may be because that the predominant species inactivating aerosolized MS2 in this study were short-lived radicals rather than long-lived ozone, whose lifetime is at the scale of nanoseconds [28] and would not be affected by the change of second-scale exposure time. Wu et al [18] reported similar limited impact of treatment time on NTP inactivation efficiency. Specifically, the study showed that doubling the treatment time would only cause a 2%\u20134% further inactivation of waterborne MS2 by plasma gas. Extrapolating the results obtained at 12\u201320 kV and 170 LPM to 30 kV according to the trendline would yield an estimated 3.5 log reduction, in agreement with the greater than 2 log reduction obtained with the fixed 30 kV neon transformer.",

The ozone dose received by aerosolized MS2 was thereby estimated as 0.0017 min mg m\u22123 at 20 kV and 0.017 min mg m\u22123 at 30 kV (assuming room temperature and pressure). According to Tseng and Li [29], 90% (1 log) inactivation of airborne MS2 required an ozone dose of 1.28 min mg m\u22123, which is 75\u2013750 times of the ozone dose provided in this study. It was therefore concluded that ozone acted as a secondary inactivating reagent in this study and that aerosolized MS2 was predominantly inactivated by radicals and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the packed-bed NTP reactor over the short exposure time.",

Results suggest that plasma was not established in the reactor and no ozone was produced until the applied Vpp exceeded 10 kV (figure 8).

Increasing air flow rates corresponded with decreasing upstream ozone concentrations due to reduction of NTP discharge energy density, and increasing downstream ozone concentrations, likely due to increasing space velocity (defined as volumetric flow rate normalized by filter volume) and thus decreasing filter performance. The much higher supplied power of the 30 kV power supply, as compared to the 20 kV power supply, also produced more ozone, approximately ten times higher at all three flow rate conditions (figure 9). This was likely a result of greater oxygen atom radical (O) production at the higher power, which reacted with the available O2 to form more O3 [32, 33]. At 170 LPM and 30 kV, the single layer of the activated carbon filter reduced upstream ozone concentrations by 96%; however, the downstream O3 concentration (0.09 ppm) still exceeded the 0.05 ppm California standard. The addition of a second filter would very likely reduce concentrations below the California standard, with little increase in the pressure drop across the filter (20 Pa at the flow rate of 170 LPM).",
