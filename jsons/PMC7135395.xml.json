Its transmission by one \u201csuperspreader\u201d in a Hong Kong hotel to wider Hong Kong (195 cases), Singapore (71), Vietnam (58), Canada (29), the United States (1), and Ireland (1) was a stark global warning of the potentially devastating effects of a surprise pandemic (Monaghan, 2004). The lessons learned from the averted SARS threat are of particular relevance in November 2005, as we face the increasing likelihood of a global pandemic if the H5N1 avian influenza virus, currently spreading from the bird population of Asia, becomes adapted for human to human transmissibility.",

Four months after the first case of SARS, the virus was identified, and determination of its complete sequence was finished only 2 weeks later. The virus genome was found to code for 28 proteins, and a month after its publication, the structure of the first SARS protein, the 3CL protease, was placed in the Protein Data Bank (Anand et al., 2003). This protease represented a prime target for design of anti-SARS drugs (Yang et al., 2003) and was followed by the structures of other SARS proteins, including parts of the SARS CoV replicase polyprotein: nsP7 (Peti et al., 2005) by NMR and nsP9 (Egloff et al., 2004) by crystallography. Among other published SARS crystal structures are the N-terminal RNA binding domain of the SARS CoV nucleocapsid protein (Huang et al., 2004), the sars2 (ORF2) spike receptor binding domain complexed with the receptor (Li et al., 2005), and the sars7a (ORF7a) transmembrane protein of so far unknown function (Nelson et al., 2005).",

Intact nsP3 is a 1922 amino acid multidomain protein with an N-terminal Glu-rich domain, an ADP-ribose-1\u2033-phosphate phosphatase (ADRP) domain, a protease active domain, the papain-like protease (PLP) domain, and finally two or three domains of unknown function. The structure of the ADRP domain, consisting of 182 amino acids, was solved using the selenium-SAD (single-wavelength anomalous dispersion) method of phase determination to 1.4 \u00c5, a resolution that allowed detailed analysis of the molecular interactions.",

By sequence alignment and structural comparison with all known H2A domains, as well as examination of functional data, the authors conjecture that proteins from this superfamily form an emerging group of nucleotide phosphatases, all with similar functionality. The putative active site of ARDP has been identified by sequence alignment with its three structural homologs; yeast Ymx7, E. coli hypothetical protein Er58, and AF1521 from Archeoglobus fulgidus. The phosphatase activity of ADRP was subsequently confirmed by in vitro experiments on enzymatically synthesized substrate (provided by E. Phizicky, University of Rochester).",

It raises the interesting possibility that the SARS virus has a fairly sophisticated mechanism, which perhaps involves multiple components of the replicase machinery, to process newly synthesized genomic and subgenomic RNA. If this theory is validated, it will provide another avenue for intervention by targeted small-molecule ligands that could have therapeutic potential.",

First, there is a paucity of genetic information available to assist with the identification of the putative protein function, since rather few viruses have been fully characterized. Second, the protocols for identifying domains, a prerequisite for expressing and purifying crystallization-grade protein, are often unsuccessful. Third, for a virus such as SARS with only 28 proteins, the success rate for structural genomics must be high for understanding of the viral biology to advance, unlike for a bacterial system where there are a many more proteins to investigate and a higher attrition rate in the pipeline can be tolerated. Last but not least, viruses are finely tuned biological systems with a large number of interdependent molecular interactions and little redundancy. This has two pivotal consequences for understanding the biology of the virus: A systematic approach is essential, and, even more importantly, a deeper structural and functional knowledge of the many complexes that the SARS CoV proteins form with one another and with proteins of the host organisms will be required\u2014research that is still in its infancy.",
