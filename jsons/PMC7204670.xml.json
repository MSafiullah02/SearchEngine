It took hardly a month for more than a million to be affected and nearly 80,000 fatalities after being declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). International borders have been locked down, travel restricted, economies slashed and billions are isolated at their own homes, as a measure to contain the outbreak (WHO Situation report as on 9 April 2020). As the therapeutic focus is mainly restricted to biological therapies worldwide to develop an effective cure for the virus, the deep-rooted psycho-social repercussions are often neglected (Singhal, 2020). Research on pandemic protocols in the past have shown the role of psycho-social preparedness in improving the resilience during a \u2018biological disaster\u2019 like such large-scale infections. Though there are well-known international guidelines for disaster management in general, specific ones guided to pandemic-preparedness are lacking, though some countries have formulated their own policies (Colizza et al., 2007). Effectiveness, applicability and feasibility are attributes which indicate that the psychosocial interventions are going to be more appropriate in the community as the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) regarding any new infection improves the preparedness in both the health-care professionals and the general public.",

As the global situation related to COVID-19 is changing rapidly each day, \u2018Community Based Disaster Preparedness\u2019(CBDP) is perhaps the method of management. CBDP is a response mechanism in an attempt to save the maximum and effective community triage (Troy et al., 2008). This leads to multi-pronged but flexible interventions to reduce vulnerability and build a self-reliant and resilient society. It is true that pandemics of such epic proportions cannot be fully controlled by any degree of preparedness but the goal here is more of harm-reduction. Earlier outbreaks have highlighted important areas. During the Zika outbreak in Brazil that eventually spread to North and South America, WHO had declared it too as a public health emergency of international concern, just like COVID-19 (World Health Organization, 2017). Research had been conducted to understand the preparedness of community-based psychosocial toolkit for ZIKA virus affected-areas (Nair et al., 2020), wherein it was understood that the lack of understanding about a new condition and uncertainty about it has a direct correlation with the preparedness among the healthcare professionals, and thereby implying policy planning and training needs to gear up towards this.",

Considering the pandemic as an ongoing process, regular updated data should be collected and assimilated from the global health agencies like WHO, CDC, and regional health ministries (like the ICMR and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in India, CDC in China, etc.). Collaboration with the media to provide unbiased information will be helpful. As social distancing makes field visit difficult, online surveys or telephonic communication might yield valuable information. The content of queries from the helplines and crisis intervention at the hospital emergency settings will help understand the various types of psycho-social problems. People with pre-existing mental disorders, people in isolation, the elderly and those institutionalized are more vulnerable and thus need to be contacted separately to ensure that their physical and medical needs are met. Liaison with nearby health-care centres and integration of alternative medicine specialists will be helpful.",

Sadly we keep needing a new threat to revise our policies!

Challenges can be its effective implementation, standardisation of the steps, impediment by social distancing as well as comparability in different countries and socio-economic strata.
