            "text": "Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses known to cause diseases ranging from the common cold to more serious diseases such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Coronaviruses were identified in the mid-1960s and are known to infect humans and certain animals (including birds and mammals). The primary target cells are the epithelial cells of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract and seven Coronaviruses are identified to be able to infect humans. They can cause common colds but also serious lower respiratory tract infections. The virus causing the current coronavirus epidemic has been called \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS-CoV-2). This was announced by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) which deals with the designation and naming of viruses (i.e. species, genus, family, etc.). The name is indicated by a group of experts specifically appointed to study the new coronavirus strain. According to this pool of scientists, the new coronavirus is the brother of what caused Sars (SARS-CoVs), hence the chosen name of SARS-CoV-2. The disease caused by the new Coronavirus has a name: \"COVID-19\" (where \"CO\" stands for corona, \"VI\" for virus, \"D\" for disease and \"19\" indicates the year in which it occurred). The Oms Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced it on February 11, 2020, during the extraordinary forum dedicated to the virus. The appearance of new pathogenic viruses for humans, previously circulating only in the animal world, is a widely known phenomenon (called spill over) and it is thought that it may also be at the basis of the origin of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The scientific community is currently trying to identify the source of the infection. On December 31, 2019, the Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan (China) reported to the Oms a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in the city of Wuhan, in the Chinese province of Hubei. On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) reported that a new coronavirus (initially called 2019-nCoV and now called SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causative agent and has been rendered publishes the genomic sequence. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared that this epidemic represents an international public health emergency. Oms on March 11, 2020 declared that COVID-19 can be defined as a pandemic. After notification of the epidemic by China, Italy immediately recommended postponing unnecessary flights to Wuhan and, subsequently, with the spread of the epidemic, to all of China. Consequently, the latter has canceled all flights from Wuhan. On 30 January, the Minister of Health ordered the suspension of air traffic with the People's Republic of China, including the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macao, on 30 January. The measure also applies to Taiwan. In consideration of the Oms declaration of \"International public health emergency\", on January 31, 2020 the Council of Ministers declared a state of emergency as a consequence of the health risk associated with Coronavirus infection. This disease does not save Italy that has become a protected area with the DPCM signed on the evening of 9 March by the Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, who has extended the restrictive measures already applied for Lombardy and the 14 northern provinces most affected by the coronavirus infection to the whole national territory. The new action comes into force on March 10 and will take effect until April 3. Among the main innovations: it limits the movement of people, blocks sporting events, suspends teaching activities in schools and universities throughout the country until April 3. With the new ordinance of 22 March 2020 issued by the Minister of Health and the Minister of the Interior, from 22 March people are prohibited from moving or moving with public or private trasportation in a municipality other than that in which they are located, except for proven work needs, of absolute urgency or for health reasons. [1] In this scenario let's try to analyze the time evolution of the Sars-Cov-2 in Italy with growth patterns. Many growth models have been very recently applied to study the Covid-19 infection [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Two very famous examples of these models are described by the Logistic [10] and the Gompertz [11] equations. The Logistic law has been applied in population dynamics, in economics, in material science and in many other sectors, while the Gompertz one describes tumor growth, kinetics of enzymatic reactions, oxygenation of hemoglobin, intensity of photosynthesis as a function of CO2 concentration, drug dose-response curve, dynamics of growth, (e.g., bacteria, normal eukaryotic organisms). The Logistic behaviour assumes that growth stops when maximum sustainable population density is reached through the carrying capacity K that depends on the environmental conditions. For example the ordinances of the Prime Minister G.Conte, the people's hygiene habits are encoded in the carrying capacity K. Whereas the Gompertz equation takes into account the aging of the population through a lower reproductive capacity over time; not knowing yet the characteristics of the virus we thought it could be a correct choice. Now we describes the regional and national choices to contain the epidemic and and consequently our strategy. At first in Italy, pharyngeal swabs were initially made only at seriously ill people. This choice, extremely correct in safeguarding the hospital structure (at least apparently), is wrong for a study of the disease data. We explain better: if we believe that the Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) is 1% [12] the number of deaths is the only data extremely relevant. From the extrapolation of total number of infected [15] we observe that the number of infected detected is only 10% of the total. This means that in Italy about 90% of the sick are not detected. Having no information, therefore, on asymptomatic and infected with mild symptoms, we decided to study the population of the severe infected with 2 equations: one for the severe infected and another coupled for the deaths, obviously the latter are related to the former. So we implement a Logistic model that take into account a possibility to consider the contribute of asymptomatic people in the evolution of the Sars-Cov-2 by means of additional constant and an equation of proportionality between infected and deaths. We consider also an interpolating between Logistic and Gompertz Model. We show that the first scenario is more optimistic and faster respect to the second one. Finally we observe the data of each region separately, noting that is present a delay in the evolution of the virus between the various regions and that each region has its own trend. In particular, Lombardia has the fastest trend and Veneto the slowest one. We conclude with the observation that Veneto's strategy of performing swabs even to asymptomatic potential seems to have successful, as can be seen from the estimate of the constant term of the logistic model.",

However, it becomes comforting with the data of March 25; the two graphs overlap and from the numerical simulations we find q = 1. This means that environmental factors, or LD, prevail over virus growth factors. 15 days after the LD we therefore started to see concrete effects, and this is compatible with the incubation times of the virus. It therefore seems obvious to study the evolution of the virus with a Logistic model when a Government applies LD. In conclusion, we expect around 111,000 diagnosed patients and around 16,000 deaths. This, considering a CFT of 1.2%, would lead to a total of about 1334,000 infected. In Fig. 3 we see that the peak is near 21-22 March and the end of the epidemic at the early May. ",

Observing Fig. 5 , we can note how the curve of daily total infected changes from day to day according to the acquisition of a new data, but the right tails of the considered curves are similar. This suggests that the end of contagion is confirmed, according to our study, at the end of April or early May. Finally, in Fig. 6 we show the correlation, according to the delay, between the temporal series of total infected and deaths. The plot represents the real data of deaths and the real ones of the total infected shifted of 4 days and rescaled according to the minimum difference between them, i.e., we search the best correlation between the deaths data and the infected shifted forward according to Eq.7 (the deaths are delayed compared to infected). By means of this analysis we found the correct delay and we calibrate the parameter K 1 of Eq.7 that represents the rate between the derivatives of infected and deaths (the value of K 1 , update at 27/03/2020, is 0.1429). 6 : Analysis of delay between infected and dead: for Italy delay is 4 days; the plot represent the real data of dead (blue circles) and the real data of total infected (red diamonds) shifted of 4 days and rescaled according to the minimum difference.",

We observe as in a week after the peak the estimated number of severe infected and deaths are increased of 20%, but in the last 4 days the trend is in accordance with the data, both numerically and in forecasting the end of the epidemic, in particular the end date is stable from March 27.

Looking at the data and from the previous simple observation, it is spontaneous to think that an analysis of the individual regions is more sensible than a global analysis of Italy.

We stress that it is very interesting that the contribution A of asymptomatics is also increased. A possible interpretation is that asymptomatics remain the most important sources of contagion in the single houses of italian people during the LD. Finally we studied the evolution of the virus in the most affected regions. A delay is present in the appearance of the virus between the individual regions, so it seems more sensible to study them individually. We have noticed how Veneto's strategy in making swabs to as many people as possible has proved successful in containing the evolution of the virus. In the upgrading of the single regions with the data at 1 April, we observe explicitly the peak of the daily severe infected and we show the effective time delay of the comparison of the Sars-Cov-2 in every regions. Finally Tuscany will be the last region with zero infections, at 4-5 May.",

Obviously this project is on-going being the possibility that the data of the next few days may change the scenario, hopefully positive, maybe in a further 6-7 days following the government's even more restrictive measures on 22",
