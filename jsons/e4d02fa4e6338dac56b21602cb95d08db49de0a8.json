Perceptual datasets (e.g., LIVE and TID2013) gathered for this purpose provide useful benchmarks for improving IQA methods, but their heavy use creates a risk of overfitting. Here, we perform a large-scale comparison of perceptual IQA models in terms of their use as objectives for the optimization of image processing algorithms. Specifically, we evaluate eleven fullreference IQA models by using them as objective functions to train deep neural networks for four low-level vision tasks: denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, and compression. Extensive subjective testing on the optimized images allows us to rank the competing models in terms of their perceptual performance, elucidate their relative advantages and disadvantages for these tasks, and propose a set of desirable properties for incorporation into future IQA models.",

The parameters of image processing methods are usually adjusted to minimize the mean squared error (MSE), the simplest of all fidelity metrics, despite the fact that it has been widely criticised for its poor correlation with human perception of image quality (Girod, 1993) . Early attempts at perceptual optimization used the structural similarity (SSIM) index (Wang et al., 2004) in place of MSE, and achieved modest gains in applications of image restoration (Channappayya et al., 2008) , wireless video streaming (Vukadinovic and Karlsson, 2009) , video coding , and image synthesis (Snell et al., 2017) . Driven by the surge of impressive results in deep neural networks (DNNs), recent authors have used perceptual measures based on pre-trained DNNs for optimization purposes (Johnson et al., 2016) , although these have not been tested against human judgments.",

To determine their suitability for optimization, we first test the models on recovering a reference image from a given initialization by optimizing the model-reported distance to the reference. For many IQA methods, we find that the optimization does not converge to the reference image, and often creates severe distortions. These optima are either local (due to non-convexity of the IQA objective), or global but nonunique (due to the loss of information in the IQA objective). We select a subset of eleven IQA models as useful \"perceptual\" objectives for use in optimizing DNNs in four low-level vision tasks -image denoising, blind image deblurring, single image super-resolution, and lossy image compression. Extensive subjective testing on the optimized images reveals the relative performance of the competing models. Moreover, careful inspection of their visual failures indicates limitations in model design, which in turn sheds light on developing future IQA models in a principled way.",

            "text": "-Error visibility methods. These apply a distance measure directly to pixels (such as MSE), or to transformed representations of the images. The MSE possesses useful properties for optimization (e.g., differentiability and convexity), and when combined with linear-algebraic tools, analytical solutions can often be obtained. For example, the classical solution to the MSE-optimal denoising problem (assuming a translation-invariant Gaussian signal model) is the Wiener filter (Weiner, 1950) . Given that MSE in the pixel domain is poorly correlated with perceived image quality, many IQA models operate by first mapping to a more perceptually appropriate representation (Safranek and Johnston, 1989; Daly, 1992; Lubin, 1993; Watson, 1993; Teo and Heeger, 1994; Watson et al., 1997; Larson and Chandler, 2010; Laparra et al., 2016) . -Structural similarity (SSIM) methods. These are constructed to measure the similarity of local image \"structures\". The prototype is the SSIM index (Wang et al., 2004) , which combines similarity measures of three conceptually independent components -luminance, contrast and structure. It has become a de facto standard in the field of perceptual image processing, and has inspired subsequent IQA models based on feature similarity (Zhang et al., 2011) , gradient similarity (Liu et al., 2012a) , edge strength similarity , and saliency similarity . -Information theoretic methods. These attempt to measure some approximation of the mutual information between the perceived reference and distorted images as an indication of perceptual image quality. Statistical modeling of the image source, the distortion process, and the HVS is critical in algorithm development. The prototype is the visual information fidelity (VIF) measure . -Learning-based methods. These learn the relationship between the input images and the perceptual distance from a large set of examples, using supervised machine learning methods. By leveraging the power of DNNs, these methods have come to dominate the field of IQA, in terms of performance on existing image quality databases (Bosse et al., 2018; Prashnani et al., 2018) . But given the high dimensionality of the input space (i.e., the number of pixels, typically millions), these methods are prone to overfitting the data. Strategies that compensate for the insufficiency of labeled training data include building on pre-trained networks Ding et al., 2020) , training on local image patches (Bosse et al., 2018) , and combining multiple IQA databases (Zhang et al., 2019b) . -Fusion-based methods. These aim to combine existing IQA methods to build a \"super-evaluator\" that exploits the diversity and complementarity of the incorporated methods for improved quality prediction performance (analogous to \"boosting\" methods in machine learning). Fusion combinations can be determined empirically (Ye et al., 2014) or learned from data (Liu et al., 2012b; Ma et al., 2019) . Some methods incorporate deterministic or statistical image priors to regularize an IQA measure (Jordan, 1881; Ulyanov et al., 2018) . Since such regularizers can be seen as a form of no-reference IQA measures (Wang and Bovik, 2011) , we also view these as fusion solutions.",

As an example, if D is the MSE, the (trivial) analytical solution is y = x, indicating full recoverability. For the majority of current IQA models, which are continuous and differentiable, solutions must be sought numerically, using gradient-based iterative solvers. We consider a total of 17 methods: three error visibility methods -MAD (Larson and Chandler, 2010) , PAMSE and NLPD , seven structural similarity methods -MS-SSIM (Wang et al., 2003) , CW-SSIM (Wang and Simoncelli, 2005) , FSIM (Zhang et al., 2011) , SFF (Chang et al., 2013) , GMSD (Xue et al., 2014) and VSI , MCSD , two information theoretical methods -IFC (Sheikh et al., 2005) and VIF , and five deep learningbased methods -GTI-CNN (Ma et al., 2018) , Deep-IQA (Bosse et al., 2018) , PieAPP (Prashnani et al., 2018) , LPIPS and DISTS (Ding et al., 2020) . As this paper focuses on the perceptual optimization performance of individual IQA measures, fusion-based methods are not included. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show the recovery results from two different initializations -a white Gaussian noise image and a JPEG compressed version of the reference image. For all methods, we find that optimization converges to a final image with a substantially lower score than that of the initial image. All models based on injective mappings (MS-SSIM, PAMSE, NLPD and DISTS) are guaranteed to recover the reference image (although the convergence may depend on the choice of initial image). Many of the remaining IQA models fail to recover the main structures of the reference image when initialized with the white Gaussian noise image, or create noticeable model-dependent distortions when initialized with the JPEG compressed image. This is because these methods rely on surjective mapping functions to transform the images to a \"perceptual\" space for quality computation. For example, GTI-CNN (Ma et al., 2018) uses a surjective DNN with four stages of convolution, subsampling, and halfwave rectification. The resulting undercomplete representation is optimized for geometric transformation invariance, at the cost of significant information loss. The examples demonstrate that preservation of some aspects of this lost information is important for perceptual quality. Similar arguments can be applied to other surjective DNN-based IQA models, such as DeepIQA (Bosse et al., 2018) and PieAPP (Prashnani et al., 2018) . In addition, with a better initialization (e.g., a JPEG compressed image with roughly correct local luminances), optimization guided by surjective models achieves a perceptually better image, compared to initialization with purely white Gaussian noise. Nevertheless, the visual quality of the final images is in some cases worse than that of the initial JPEG image (see Fig. 2 (h), (n) (o) and (p)).",

            "text": "1. MAE, the Mean Absolute Error ( 1 -norm) of pixel values, has been frequently adopted in optimization similar as MSE, despite its poor perceptual relevance. MAE has been shown to consistently outperform MSE in image restoration tasks (Zhao et al., 2016) . 2. MS-SSIM (Wang et al., 2003) , the Multi-Scale extension of the SSIM index (Wang et al., 2004) , provides more exibility than single-scale SSIM, allowing for a wider range of viewing distances. MS-SSIM has become a standard \"perceptual\" quality measure, and has guided the design of DNN-based image super-resolution (Zhao et al., 2016; Snell et al., 2017) and compression (Ball\u00e9 et al., 2018) algorithms. 3. VIF , the Visual Information Fidelity measure, predicts the quality of the distorted image by quantifying how much information in the reference image is preserved. VIF can be computed either in spatial or wavelet (Simoncelli et al., 1992) domain. A distinct property of VIF relative to other IQA models is that it can indicate that the \"distorted\" image has visual quality superior to that of the reference . 4. CW-SSIM (Wang and Simoncelli, 2005) , the Complex Wavelet SSIM index, is designed to be robust to small geometric distortions such as translation and rotation. The construction allows for consistent phase shifts of wavelet coefficients, which preserves local image features. CW-SSIM addresses the limitation of most IQA methods that require a precise registration process at the front end. 5. MAD (Larson and Chandler, 2010) , the Most Apparent Distortion measure, explicitly models adaptive strategies of the HVS. Specifically, a detectionbased strategy is employed for near-threshold distortions, and an appearance-based strategy is activated if the distortions are clearly visible. 6. FSIM (Zhang et al., 2011) , the Feature SIMilarity index, computes quality estimates based on phase congruency (Kovesi, 1999) as the primary feature, and incorporates the gradient magnitude as the complementary feature. It also supplies a color version by making quality measurements from chromatic components. 7. GMSD (Xue et al., 2014) , the Gradient Magnitude Similarity Deviation, computes pixel-wise gradient magnitude similarity followed by standard deviation (std) pooling. This pooling strategy is problematic: an image with large but constant local distortion yields an std of zero (indicating the best predicted quality). 8. VSI , the Visual Saliency Induced quality index, assumes that the change of salient regions due to image degradation is closely related to the change of visual quality. It combines saliency magnitude similarity with gradient magnitude similarity, and demonstrates good quality prediction performance, especially for localized distortions, such as local patch substitution (Ponomarenko et al., 2015) . 9. NLPD , the Normalized Laplacian Pyramid Distance, mimics the nonlinear transformations of the early visual system: local luminance subtraction and local gain control, and combines these values using weighted p -norms. The parameters are optimized to minimize the representation redundancies, instead of matching human judgments. NLPD has been successfully employed to optimize image rendering algorithms Laparra et al., 2017) , where the input reference image has a much higher dynamic range than that of the display. It has also been used to optimize a compression system . 10. LPIPS , the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity model, computes the distance between deep representations of two images. The authors showed that feature maps of different DNN architectures have \"reasonable\" effectiveness in accounting for human perception of image quality. As LPIPS has many different configurations, we choose the default one based on the VGG network (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015) with the weights learned from the BAPPS dataset .",

Successful blind deblurring methods, such as (Fergus et al., 2006; Pan et al., 2016) , rely heavily on statistical priors of natural images and geometric priors of blur kernels. With the success of deep learning, many DNN-based approaches (Tao et al., 2018; Kupyn et al., 2018) attempt to directly learn the mapping function for blind deblurring without explicitly estimating the blur kernel. Here we also adopted this \"kernel-free\" approach to train a DNN for image deblurring in an end-to-end fashion.

More recently, many researchers have demonstrated the visual benefits of nonlinear transforms, especially DNN-based learnable ones that are capable of adapting their parameters to different bitrate budgets. In this paper, we constructed two DNNs for analysis and synthesis transforms, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5 . The analysis transform f a maps the image to a latent feature vector z, whose values are then quantized to L levels with the centers being {c 1 , . . . , c L }, where c i \u2208 R for i = 1, . . . , L. This quantized representationz = Q(f a (x)), is fed to the synthesis transform f s to reconstruct the compressed image: y = f s (z). The quantization step has zero gradients almost everywhere, which prevents gradient-based training via backpropagation . Hence, we used a soft differentiable approximation (Mentzer et al., 2018) Fig. 3 Network architecture used for denoising and deblurring. Apart from initial and final convolutional blocks, it contains 16 residual blocks, each consisting of two convolutions and a halfwave rectifier (ReLU). Conv h \u00d7 w \u00d7 c in \u00d7 c out indicates affine convolution with filter size h \u00d7 w, over c in input channels, producing c out output channels. Fig. 4 Network architecture used for super-resolution, containing 16 residual blocks followed by two upsampling modules, each composed of an upsampler (factor of 2, using nearest-neighbor interpolation) and a convolution.",

First, a number of models are sensitive to initializations (e.g., CW-SSIM, MAD, FSIM, GMSD, and VSI) and pre-trainng yields more reasonable optimization results (also validated in the task of reference image recovery). Second, models that require backpropagating gradients through multiple stages of computation (e.g., LPIPS and DISTS) converge much faster.

We averaged\u03bc k over the 20 test images, resulting in four global rankings of perceptual optimization performance, as shown in Fig. 8 . It is clear that MS-SSIM (Wang et al., 2003) and MAE are superior to the other IQA models in the task of denoising, whereas DNN-based measures DISTS (Ding et al., 2020) and LPIPS , outperform the others in the tasks of deblurring, super-resolution, and compression. Thus, there is no single IQA model that performs best across all tasks. We ascribe this to differences in the nature of the tasks: denoising requires distinguishing signal and noise, whereas deblurring, super-resolution and compression must recover missing details conditioned on the degraded information. Therefore, MS-SSIM and MAE that are known to prefer smooth appearances excel at denoising, despite close quantitative performance for most IQA models; DISTS and LPIPS that explicitly represent aspects of fine texture are superior for the remaining three tasks. Finally, it is important to note that many recent models, despite their impressive abilities to explain existing IQA databases, do not offer additional perceptual gains over MAE (and may even reduce perceptual quality).",

Fig. 10 Deblurring results for two regions cropped from an example image, using a DNN optimized for different IQA models. Fig. 9 shows the denoising results of the \"cat\" image. It is not hard to observe that MAE, MS-SSIM, and NLPD do a good job in denoising flat regions, but tend to over-smooth texture regions. VIF encourages detail enhancement, leading to artificial local contrast, while GMSD produces a relatively dark appearance presumably because it discards local luminance information. Moreover, the results of FSIM and VSI exhibit noticeable artifacts. LPIPS and DISTS preserve fine details, but may not fully remove noise in smooth regions, mistaking the remaining noise as visually plausible texture. Overall, traditional IQA models MAE and MS-SSIM denoise images with various content variations robustly, keeping high-frequency information loss within the acceptable range. This may explain why they are still the dominant objective functions in this task. Fig. 10 shows the deblurring results of the \"basket\" image. We find that most IQA methods fail, but in different ways. Specifically, the results of MAE, MS-SSIM, CW-SSIM, and NLPD are still quite blurry. FSIM, GMSD, and VSI generate severe ringing artifacts. VIF again fails to adjust the local contrast. MAD exhibits undesirable dot artifacts, although the main structures are sharp. LPIPS succeeds in deblurring this example, while DISTS produces a result that is closest to the original. This is consistent with current state-of-the-art deblurring results, generated by incorporating comparison of the later stages of the VGG features into the loss. Fig. 11 shows the super-resolution results of the \"corner tower\" image. Again, MAE, MS-SSIM, NLPD, and especially CW-SSIM produce somewhat blurry images, without recovering fine details that contain highfrequency information. MAD, FSIM, GMSD, and VSI are able to generate some \"structures\", but these are perceived as unpleasant model-dependent artifacts. Benefiting from its texture synthesis capability, DISTS has the potential to super-resolve perceptually plausible fine details, although they differ from those of the original image. Fig. 12 shows the compression results of the \"airplane\" image at 0.24 \u00b1 0.01 bpp. A JPEG image, compressed to 0.25 bpp, suffers from block and blur artifacts. Overall, the main structures of the original image are well preserved for most IQA models, but the fine details (e.g., the lawn) have to be discarded at this low bitrate, or are poorly synthesized as other forms of distortions. VIF reconstitutes a dreary image with overenhanced global contrast, and CW-SSIM superimposes wavy artifacts on the underlying image.

            "text": "-Ringing is a high-frequency distortion type that often occurs in the optimized images by FSIM, VSI and GMSD (see Fig. 10 (i) -(k)). One common characteristic of the three models is that they rely heavily (in some cases, solely) on local gradient magnitude for feature similarity comparison, underweighting (or abandoning) other perceptually important features (such as local luminance and local phase). This creates enormous \"shortcuts\" that DNN-based computational models can take to generate distortions with similar local gradient statistics. -Dot patterns are typical in the optimization results of MAD, which extracts lower-order image statistics from responses of Gabor filters at multiple scales and orientations. The resulting set of statistical measurements is insufficient to summarize natural image structures that exhibit higher-order dependencies. Therefore, MAD is \"blind\" to distortions that satisfy the same set of statistical constraints, and gives the optimized distorted image a high-quality score. -Over-enhancement of local image contrast is encouraged by VIF, which, in most of our experiments, causes significant quality degradation. We believe this arises because VIF does not fully respect reference information when normalizing the covariance term. Specifically, only the second-order statistics of the reference image are used to construct the normalization factor. By incorporating the same statistics computed from the distorted image into normalization, the problem of over-enhancement may be alleviated. In general, quality assessment of image enhancement is a challenging problem (Fang et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015) , and to the best of our knowledge, all existing full-reference IQA models fail to reward properly-enhanced cases, while penalizing over-enhanced cases. -Luminance and color artifacts are perceived in final images that are associated with many IQA models. Two causes seem plausible. First, methods such as GMSD discard luminance information, leaving a huge \"null space\" to accommodate luminance distortions. Second, methods such as MS-SSIM and NLPD are originally designed for grayscale images only. Applying them to RGB channels separately fails to take into account saturation (color contrast). Transforming to a perceptually better color space, and making use of knowledge of color distortions (Rajashekar et al., 2009 ) offers an opportunity for improvement.",

This provides an alternative means of testing the perceptual relevance of IQA models in a more realistic setting, which we believe is an important complement to the conventional methodology for IQA model evaluation. Extensive subjective testing led to several useful findings. First, through perceptual optimization, we generated a number of novel distortions (different from those in existing IQA databases), which may easily fool many competing models. It should be noted that the emergence of specific distortions is in principle dependent on the experimental setting (e.g., initialization strategy, model architecture, and optimization technique). Second, standard full-reference IQA models, MS-SSIM and MAE, will continue to play a central role in optimizing image processing systems due to their robustness and simplicity. Third, more recent IQA models with surjective mappings may still be used to monitor image quality and to optimize the parameter settings of image processing methods, but in a limited and well-controlled space.

First, inspired by the philosophy of \"analysis by synthesis\" (Grenander, 1970) , Wang and Simoncelli (2008) introduced the maximum differentiation competition methodology to automatically synthesize images for efficiently comparing IQA models. However, the generated images may be highly unnatural, and therefore are of less practical importance. Ma et al. (2020) alleviated this issue by manually constraining the search space to a finite image set of current interest. Our approach can be seen as a mixture of the two methods, in the sense that the test images are automatically generated, and are well-controlled by specifying realistic vision tasks. Second, the existence of type II adversarial examples (Szegedy et al., 2013) has exposed the vulnerability of many computer vision algorithms, where a tiny change to the input that is imperceptible to the human eye would cause the algorithm to make classification mistakes. In our case, weaknesses in an IQA model are exposed through optimized images that serve as type I adversarial examples of the model: a significant change is made to the original image that substantially degrades its perceptual quality, but the model claims this image is of high quality.",

First, the transformation used in the IQA model should be perceptual, mapping the input images into a space where Euclidean distances match human measurements of image quality. This is in the same spirit that color scientists pursue perceptually uniform color spaces. Zhang et al. (2018) and Ding et al. (2020) demonstrated that a cascade of linear convolution, downsampling, and rectified nonlinearity optimized for highlevel vision tasks may be a good candidate. Second, the IQA model should enjoy unique optima (i.e., the underlying mapping should be injective) to guarantee that images close to optimum are visually similar to the original. This criterion was respected by early models (e.g., MS-SSIM), but was largely overlooked in recent IQA model development. Third, the IQA model should be continuous and differentiable, with well-behaved gradients, to aid optimization in complex situations (e.g., training DNNs with millions of parameters). Last but not least, the IQA model should be computationally efficient, enabling real-time quality assessment and perceptual optimization.",

            "text": "A conventional method for evaluating IQA models is to compute their agreement with subjective scores in one or more standardized IQA databases (e.g., LIVE , CSIQ (Larson and Chandler, 2010) or TID2013 (Ponomarenko et al., 2015) ), consisting of artificially distorted images. Many existing IQA models achieved impressive correlation numbers on these databases (see Table 2 ), but their performance in assessing the perceptual quality of images produced by low-level vision algorithms has not been tested. In this appendix, we tested them on multiple human-rated image generation/restoration quality assessment databases, including -A denoising database -FLT (Egiazarian et al., 2018) , consisting of 300 filtered images from 75 grayscale texture images by the BM3D algorithm with different levels of noise suppression. -Two motion deblurring databases -Liu13 (Liu et al., 2013) and Lai16 (Lai et al., 2016) . Liu13 contains 240 synthetically blurred examples, each of which is deblurred by five algorithms. Lai16 synthesizes 100 non-uniformly and 100 uniformly blurred images, which are further deblurred by 13 algorithms. -Two super-resolution databases -Ma17 (Ma et al., 2017a) and QADS . The former has 1, 620 super-resolved images from 9 methods, while the latter contains 980 images created by 21 methods. -A dehazing database -SHRQ (Min et al., 2019) , composed of 45 regular hazy images and 30 aerial hazy images, which are dehazed by 8 algorithms. -A depth image-based rendering database -Tian19 (Tian et al., 2018) , consisting of 140 rendered images from 10 sequences with 7 methods. -Two texture synthesis databases -SynTex (Golestaneh et al., 2015) and TQD (Ding et al., 2020) . SynTex contains 105 synthesized textures using 5 algorithms from 21 reference textures. TQD has 10 reference textures, each with 15 variations, including 7 artificially distorted images, 4 example-based synthesized textures and 4 cropped subimages. -A patch database -BAPPS , which includes 26.9K image patches generated by colorization, video deblurring, frame interpolation, and super-resolution algorithms, respectively. Table 3 shows the performance comparisons of 13 IQA methods in terms of SRCC. Considering the potential noisy judgements, BAPPS is evaluated using the 2AFC score: pq + (1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 q), where p is the percentage of human votes and q = {0, 1} is the vote of an IQA model. When q is closer to the majority of human votes, the 2AFC score is larger, indicating better performance (see Table 4 ). We find that the overall performance of all models is lower compared to that in the standard IQA databases (see Table 2 ), indicating the difficulty when applying to unseen distortions. Moreover, DNNbased measures are relatively better than knowledgedriven models in these application-oriented databases, but there is still significant room for improvement to meet the real-world challenges. Fig. 14 and Fig. 15 show two quality assessment examples of compression and super-resolution, respectively. Here we only compared the most widely used measures: PSNR and SSIM, and the two that performed best both on optimization and assessment: LPIPS and DISTS. It is not surprising to find that PSNR and SSIM have poor correlations with human opinions, as they focus more on signal fidelity rather than percep-tual quality. LPIPS and DISTS perform better, but the former is somewhat oversensitive to texture substitution (see Fig. 15 ). As many recent image restoration algorithms succeed in generating richer textures, DISTS holds much promise for use in quality assessment for such applications. , EDSR (Lim et al., 2017) , SRGAN (Ledig et al., 2017) , ESRGAN , and RankSRGAN (Zhang et al., 2019a) , respectively. One can see that the GAN-based results (f)-(h) are visually superior to the others, contrary to the predictions of PSNR and SSIM. LPIPS indicates that the result (f) is worse than (d) and (e), in disagreement with visual inspection. DISTS is correlated well with human perception in this example.",
