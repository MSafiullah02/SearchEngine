PRRs recognize danger signals that are essential, structure-conserved, and specific signature molecules of a diverse array of pathogens, which are called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and danger/damage-associated molecular patterns that are molecules released from intracellular stores of damaged or stressed host cells. This recognition triggers the secretion of a large amount of inflammatory cytokines and antiviral cytokines, such as type I interferons (IFNs), for effective host defense by eradicating infectious pathogens and for the development of long-lasting pathogen-specific adaptive immunity through B and T cells [1\u20133].",

            "text": "A total of 10 TLRs in humans and 12 TLRs in mice have been identified to date. TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 10 are primarily expressed on the surface of immune cells and mainly recognize bacterial and fungal cell wall components and viral envelope proteins, as well as protozoal components [1,2,5]. In contrast, the nucleic acid-sensing TLRs, which include TLRs 3, 7, 8, 9, and 13 (only expressed in mice), are completely localized within the endosomal compartments of immune cells and recognize double stranded RNA (dsRNA), single stranded RNA (ssRNA) and DNA derived from viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, respectively. Upon recognition of respective foreign nucleic acids, signal transduction through these receptors is initiated by the recruitment of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) or the TIR domain-containing adapter molecule (TRIF) (also known as the TIR domain containing adapter molecule 1, TICAM1) that results in the activation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7, activator protein 1 (AP-1), and nuclear transcription-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and transcription of in\ufb02ammatory cytokines, type I IFNs, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides and innate immune response genes (Table 1) [1\u20135]. However, recognition of \u2018self\u2019-nucleic acids by the nucleic acid-sensing TLRs contributes to the pathology associated with several autoimmune or autoin\ufb02ammatory diseases under certain pathological conditions. In this review, we discuss the recent progress in studies of pathogen-associated nucleic acid recognition and signaling pathways within endosomal compartments, and the individual functions of TLRs 3, 7, 8, 9, and 13 in innate immunity. In addition, we discuss the compartmentalization, intracellular trafficking, proteolytic cleavage, autophagy, and regulatory programs of these TLRs in innate immunity.\n",

            "text": "The expression of TLRs 3, 7, 8, 9, and 13 is distinct in different cell types of human and murine origins. TLR3 is observed in the human myeloid DCs (mDCs), macrophages, natural killer cells, and B cells [6,16]. TLR3 mRNA has also been detected in epithelial cells of many different organs including airway, uterine, corneal, vaginal, biliary, and intestinal organs because the mucous membranes of these organs act as efficient innate barriers to infection from the respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal and urogenital systems [6,16]. Surprisingly, higher expression level of TLR3 is also observed in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, suggesting a specific function in response to encephalitogenic viruses of the central nervous system [6,17,18]. TLRs 7 and 9 are predominantly expressed in plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) in humans and are involved in strong IFN-\u03b1 induction, but TLR8 tends to be detected in human monocytes and mDCs, and predisposes the induction of inflammatory cytokines [1,19\u201323]. In mice, TLR7 is highly expressed in pDCs, while TLR8 is expressed in all four splenic DC subsets including CD4+ DCs, CD8+ DCs, CD4\u2212 CD8\u2212 DCs, and pDCs. The precise function of murine TLR8 remains to be elucidated [1,19\u201323]. Expression of TLR9 is detected in murine B cells, pDCs, monocytes/macrophages, and conventional DCs (cDCs) [1,19\u201323]. Unlike it in mouse, TLR9 expression in human is restricted to pDCs and B cells [1,19\u201323], reflecting possible species-specific differences in the expression of TLRs 7, 8, and 9 between mouse and human. Interestingly, a recent report showed that virus-induced signaling adaptor (VISA) regulates B cell expression of TLR7 and CD23 [24], suggesting an unexpected link between TLRs and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs). In addition, TLR13 is a novel functional TLR that is predominantly expressed in cDCs and macrophages [13,14].",

Interestingly, a tyrosine-based internalization motif in the cytosolic tail of human TLR9 or the TM \u03b1-helix of mouse TLR9 is required to target it to the endosomal compartments, but mutation of structural motifs of TLR9 results in its redistribution to the cell surface [33]. Surprisingly, cell-surface expression of a mutant form of TLR9 (TLR9TM-MUT) in TLR9-deficient myeloid cells resulted in more MyD88 recruitment to TLR9 in response to cytidine-phosphate-guanosine DNA (CpG-DNA) or self-DNA than that caused by expression of wild-type TLR9, even after inhibition of proteolytic processing [34].",

The heat shock protein glycoprotein 96 (gp96, also known as grp94) not only is required for folding and mobilization of cell surface TLR, but also regulates the intracellular trafficking of nucleic acid-sensing TLRs [35,36]. In the absence of gp96, TLR7 and TLR9 remain in the ER and gp96-de\ufb01cient macrophages fail to respond to agonists of TLR7 and TLR9 [35,36]. Another chaperone proteins known as protein associated with TLR4 (PRAT4A, also known as Cnpy3) is required for trafficking of nucleic acid-sensing TLRs from the ER to endosomes and of cell-surface TLRs from the ER to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, PRAT4A associates with and translocates TLRs 7 and 9 rather than TLR3 from the ER to the endosomes, indicating that trafficking of TLRs 3, 7, and 9 is differentially regulated [37,38]. Therefore, gp96 and PRAT4A are critical for both TLR9 egress from the ER and for the conformational stability and function of these receptors in the endosomal compartments. In addition to gp96 and PRAT4A, regulatory molecules solute carrier family 15 member 4 (Slc15a4), adapter-related protein complex-3 (AP-3), hermansky-Pudlak syndrome proteins of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelle complex (BLOC)-1 and BLOC-2 groups, phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), and hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS) are essential for TLR7 and/or TLR9-mediated specialized membrane trafficking in pDCs [39\u201341].",

Unc93b1 is also required for cytokine production, up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules, and efficient cross-presentation of exogenous antigens via MHC class I and class II molecules [42\u201344]. Although the precise mechanism by which Unc93b1 controls each TLR trafficking is yet to be elucidated, it is known that Unc93b1 is essential for the activation of TLRs 3, 7, 8, 9, and 13, and efficient translocation of each TLR from the ER to endosomes [42\u201344]. Unc93b1 with an H412R mutation cannot exit the ER and overexpression of Unc93b1 increases trafficking of TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 to endosomes [45]. Furthermore, TLRs 7 and 9, but not TLR3, compete with each other for association with Unc93b1. Under normal circumstances, Unc93b1 physically associates with TLR9, and overexpression of TLR9 inhibits TLR7 signal transduction, resulting in a weaker TLR7 response to RNA. However, a D34A mutation in Unc93b1 has been found to up-regulate ligand-induced trafficking of TLR7 and down-regulate that of TLR9, leading to systemic lethal in\ufb02ammation [46\u201349]. This indicates that physical association between UNC93B and nucleic acid-sensing TLRs is essential and, specifically, Unc93B1 controls homeostatic TLR7 activation by balancing trafficking of TLR9 and TLR7 to protect host from the initiation of autoimmune diseases. Thus, the compartmentalization of nucleic acid-sensing TLRs is regulated by ER-resident molecules, such as gp96, PRAT4A, and Unc93b1.",

Three research groups have independently shown that TLR9 ECD is proteolytically cleaved and removed at its flexible loop between LRR 14 and 15 by multiple acid-dependent proteases within endosomal compartment, generating the resultant half ECD, as well as the TM and the cytosolic TIR domain. The TIR domain forms a functional signaling complex with MyD88 to directly mediate DNA recognition and initiate signal transduction [50\u201352]. Surprisingly, full-length TLR9 is found only in the ER, whereas the cleaved, functional TLR9 is restricted to within endosomal compartment [50\u201352]. Proteases involved in TLR9 cleavage include cathepsins, such as cathepsin B, cathepsin S, cathepsin L, cathepsin H, and cathepsin K, and asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) [53\u201355]. However, the structural basis for recognition of CpG DNA by functional cleavage of TLR9 remains unclear so far. Interestingly, specific deletion of LRR in TLR9 renders it unresponsive to CpG DNA, mutations in the positively charged N-terminal region of TLR9 cannot affect its binding toCpG DNA, indicating the importance of multiple LRRs in TLR9 activation [55\u201357].\n",

The importance of autophagy in the regulation of innate immune recognition of pathogens in phagosomes or autophagosomes has been revealed by a number of recent studies. Autophagy is important for the regulation of nucleic acid-sensing TLRs, especially TLR7 [30,31,60\u201363]. A subset of nucleic acid-sensing TLR ligands, including synthetic nucleic acid-analogs, bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa, can induce autophagy. Synthetic nucleic acid-analogs and pathogens are able to induce the formation of phagolysosomes or autolysosomes via fusion of double-membrane vesicles (phagosomes or autophagosomes) with late endosomes or lysosomes, which are highly acidifying environments containing abundant degradation enzymes. The ligands are then delivered to endosomal compartments where recognition by nucleic acid-sensing TLRs occurs in pDCs, macrophage cells, and B cells [30,31,60\u201363]. Although host ssRNAs can also be taken up by macrophages or pDCs during phagocytosis of necrotic cells/infected cells, they rarely reach the endosomal compartments. Several essential components of the autophagic machinery, such as autophagy-related proteins (ATGs) and Beclin, are required for phagolysosome or autolysosome formation, endosomal maturation, and activation of signaling pathways downstream of nucleic acid-sensing TLRs after ligand stimulation [30,31,64].",

In addition to this role in bacteria, the role of autophagy in defense against viruses in pDCs has been demonstrated, especially in the innate recognition of viral replication products, such as those of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [60], Sendai virus (SeV) [60], herpes simplex virus (HSV) [60], in\ufb02uenza A virus (IAV), Dengue virus (DENV) [67], Poliovirus [68], coronaviruses [69], Coxsackie B virus (CBV) [70], foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) [71], and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [72]. Two different ligands of TLR7, ssRNA and imiquimod, are able to induce the formation of autophagosomes via the TLR7-MyD88-dependent signaling pathway in macrophages, characterized by microtubule-associated light chain 3-green fluorescent protein (LC3-GFP) puncta formation for the elimination of BCG, and both Atg5 and Beclin are required for the induction of autophagy [65]. In the case of IAV, the virus internalizes into endosomes to be recognized by TLR7, but VSV and SeV replication intermediates formed during virus infection are required for recognition, and autophagosomes are necessary for host cells to respond to VSV and SeV infection via TLR7 [60]. In addition, pDCs take advantage of an autophagic process in which \u2018self\u2019 nucleic acids are degraded inside double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes [60]. In the absence of ATG5 in pDCs, type I IFNs cannot be induced in response to CpG-DNA and HSV-1 infection [60]. It suggests that cytoplasmic virions are engulfed by autophagosomes, which then fuse with lysosomes. Autophagy may therefore control either the endosomal maturation required for CpG-DNA sensing. Alternatively, autophagy may regulate the TLR9-MyD88-IRF7 signaling pathways in pDCs to induce type I IFNs.",

Deletion of an arginine-rich RNA-binding domain from the HBV CP abolished its enhancement effect on TLR3 signaling [137], demonstrating that several viral RNA-binding proteins can enhance the dsRNA-dependent innate immune response initiated by TLR3. In addition, anti-microbial peptide LL37, the only known human member of the cathelicidin family of antimicrobial peptides, enhances poly(I:C) or rhinovirus infection-induced TLR3 signaling, and enables the recognition of viral dsRNAs by TLR3 in a human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS2B) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [138].",

However, TLR3 may support viral growth or pathogenesis rather than protect mice from infection by viruses. For example, TLR3-/- mice were found to have stronger resistance to WNV infection, as WNV could disrupt the blood\u2013brain barrier leading to the enhancement of virus entry into the brain via TLR3-mediated induction of peripheral inflammatory cytokines [75]. TLR3 has a synergetic function with RIG-I and MDA5 in the restriction of DENV in cultured human cells [76]. Additionally, studies of wild-type mice with IAV infection have shown that TLR3 is essential for mediating inflammatory response to host morbidity and lethality [77]. In addition, TLR3 also senses dsRNA derived from protozoa and fungi, such as Schistosoma mansoni, and Aspergillus fumigatus [90,91]. Taken together, the various known functions of TLR3 reflect the complexity of its roles in the regulation of host immune response.",

Human TLRs 7 and 8, and mouse TLR7 recognize imidazoquinolines and initiate immune response, whereas mouse TLR8 is thought not to be activated by imidazoquinolines or ssRNA due to a five amino-acid deletion in the ECD [139,140]. Nevertheless, mouse TLR8 could be activated by poly(dT)17 oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) combined with the 3M-002, leading to the induction of TNF-\u03b1 [141], suggesting that mouse TLR8 may be functionally active in the detection of DNA viruses. In support of this, a previous study showed that vaccinia virus (VACV) as well asvaccinia viral poly(A)/T-rich DNA could activate pDCs in a TLR8-dependent manner [12], suggesting that mouse TLR8 may regulate innate immunity against VACV infection. Interestingly, mouse TLR8 was found to inhibit TLR7-sensing of 3M-001 in HEK293 cells, and mouse TLR8\u2212/\u2212 DCs showed increased responses to various TLR7 ligands and NF-\u03baB activation, indicating that TLR8 may directly modulate TLR7 function [142]. In addition, guanine analogs, such as 7-allyl-8-oxoguanosine (loxoribine) and gardiquimod, and pyrimidine analog bropirimine can induce the production of various cytokines via TLR7 in humans and mice [139,140], suggesting the possibility of exploiting imidazoquinolines and nucleoside analogs as adjuvants for therapy, vaccination, and anti-tumor response in humans and animals.",

Adenosines (A)/U or G/U-rich synthetic ssRNA (RNA40) derived from the U5 region of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and polyU RNA of IAV are sensed by TLR7 in mice and by TLR7 and TLR8 in humans [92,93]. More specifically, GU-rich synthetic ssRNAs may be responsible for TLR7-mediated IFN-\u03b1 production, and AU-rich synthetic ssRNA for the induction of inflammatory cytokines in a TLR8-dependent manner [92,93,143]. In addition to HIV and IAV, GU-rich ssRNAs derived from a variety of viruses, such as SeV [94], VSV [94], CBV [95], human parechovirus 1 [96], FMDV [97], Newcastle disease virus (NDV) [98], DENV [99], HCV [100], and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [101], have been identified as natural ligands for TLR7 and/or TLR8 (Table 2). TLR7 could also recognize mouse pneumonia virus, mouse mammary tumor virus, and murine leukemia virus (MuLV) via the TLR7-MyD88-dependent signaling pathway [102,103]. Interestingly, the dsRNA bluetongue virus induces the production of a significant amount of type I IFNs and in\ufb02ammatory cytokines in pDCs via a MyD88-dependent but TLR7/8-independent signaling pathway [144]. pDCs do not express TLR3 and do not use the RIG-1/MDA5 signaling pathway, however, it is still not known how pDCs respond to dsRNA virus infection [144]. These data indicate that dsRNA viruses may induce the secretion of type I IFNs and in\ufb02ammatory cytokines in pDCs via a novel TLR-independent and MyD88-dependent pathway.",

These modified ssRNAs are usually not recognized by TLRs 7 and 8. However, as viral RNA also contains these modi\ufb01cations in infected cells and puri\ufb01ed \u2018self\u2019 mRNA or DNA can induce TLR7-and TLR9-mediated signaling [30,145,146], it suggests that the structure, sequence or modification of RNA/DNA may be a minor factor in discriminating \u2018self\u2019 and \u2018non-self\u2019 by TLRs 7, 8, and 9, and any endogenous RNA/DNA sequence may result in activation of these TLRs, but the compartmentalization of nucleic acid-sensing TLRs and nucleic acid-based regulatory programs are keys for distinguishing \u2018self\u2019 from foreign nucleic acids. Surprisingly, CD14 is dispensable for viral uptake but is required for triggering MyD88-dependent induction of inflammatory cytokines via TLRs 7, 8, and 9 by stimulatory ssRNA/CpG DNA and various types of VSV [147,148]. This suggests that CD14 not only promotes the selective uptake of nucleic acids, but also acts as a co-receptor for endosomal TLR activation.",

However, it is currently unknown if ssRNA derived from VSV can be acted as a ligand for TLR13 [13]. Recent studies have identified a conserved 23S rRNA sequence \u2018CGGAAAGACC\u2019 derived from Streptococcus aureus as a natural ligand for TLR13 [14,134]. Interestingly, the rRNA sequence recognized by TLR13 is bound by certain antibiotics, and bacterial strains that have evolved to resist these antibiotics cannot be detected by TLR13 [14,134]. We speculate that widespread ancient antibiotic resistance has subverted TLR13-driven antibacterial immune resistance, and may explain why TLR13 expression has been lost in certain mammalian species (including humans). The function of TLR13 might be replaced by an RNA-sensing PRR in humans that can still recognize erythromycin resistance-forming RNA modifications. In addition, TLR13 has also been shown to activate NF-\u03baB in response to bacterial RNA or Streptococcus pyogenes in an RNA-specific manner [135].",

Collaboration of several TLRs may be the key factor in host resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis because TLR2-/--TLR4-/--TLR9-/- mice showed markedly enhanced susceptibility to Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus suis and M. tuberculosis infections [120\u2013122]. TLR9 activation by pneumococcal DNA was observed only in cells with live bacterial infection [123]. A recent study reported that TLR9 was important in host defense against M1T1 GAS infections by increasing macrophage hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 levels, and oxidative burst and nitric oxide production in response to GAS, contributing to GAS clearance in vivo in both localized cutaneous and systemic infection models [124]. On the other hand, the virulence factor DNase Sda1 of M1T1 GAS has the ability to degrade bacterial DNA and suppress TLR9-dependent INF-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 induction [125]. Thus, this is a novel mechanism of bacterial innate immune evasion based on autodegradation of CpG-rich DNA by a bacterial DNase. TLR9 was also shown to be critical for the induction of type I IFNs signaling and the phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 in DCs in response to S. aureus, illustrating an additional mechanism through which S. aureus induces the innate immune signaling during infection [126]. One possibility is that bacterial DNA may be delivered to endosomal compartments where acidic conditions (pH = 5.5 to 6.2) lead to the degradation of dsDNA containing multiple CpG motif sequences which are recognized by TLR9. This suggests again that the compartmentalization is a very important element in TLR9 (as well as TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 13) activation.",

In addition to A. fumigatus, Candida albicans, S. cerevisiae, Malassezia furfur, and Cryptococcus neoformans DNAs are capable of triggering TLR9 recruitment, demonstrating that TLR9 is compartmentalized selectively to fungal phagosomes and negatively modulates macrophage antifungal effector functions [108,109,133]. Interestingly, hemozoin, a crystalline metabolite of hemoglobin produced by Plasmodium falciparum, acts as an inducer of TLR9 and potently activates macrophages and DCs to produce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [130]. Notably, TLR9 recognizes P. falciparum DNA contained in purified hemozoin, which appears to be a carrier that transports P. falciparum DNA to endosomes [131], consistent with the conclusion that ligand delivery is an essential condition for intracellular TLR9 recognition. However, the role of hemozoin in TLR9 activation needs to be more fully elucidated in future studies.",

MyD88 is a specific adaptor molecule containing a TIR domain in its C-terminal region and a dead domain in its N terminal region. Upon stimulation, TLRs 7, 8, and 9 interact with the TIR domain of MyD88 to recruit signaling molecules IL-1 receptor-associated kinases 4/1/2 (IRAK4/1/2) and interact with TRAF3/6, Ubc13, and Uev1A, forming a signaling complex [1\u20133,7\u20139,151]. This complex recruits TAK1 and TAK1-binding proteins 1/2/3 (TAB1/2/3), and is activated by the K63-linked polyubiquitin chain of TRAF6, phosphorylated IKK\u03b2, and MAP kinase kinase 6 (MKK6). This phenomenon results in the activation of a classical IKK complex, consisting of IKK1/\u03b1, IKK2/\u03b2, and IKK3/\u03b3 (also called NF-\u03baB essential modulator, NEMO), which leads to I\u03baB degradation and thereby contributes to the activation of NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways to induce secretion of inflammatory cytokines [1\u20133,7\u20139,151\u2013153].",

TLR7 and TLR9 recruit MyD88 and IRAK4, which then interact with TRAF6, TRAF3, IRAK1, IKK\u03b1, osteopontin (OPN), and IRF7 to form a super-molecular complex [1,2,7,8,151]. Ultimately, IRF7 is phosphorylated by IRAK1 and/or IKK\u03b1 and translocated to the nucleus to induce the transcription of type I IFNs [1,2,7,8,151]. In addition, a phosphoinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K) mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR)-p70S6K pathway is beneficial for the induction of type I IFNs in MyD88-dependent activation of IRF7 in pDCs [154]. IRF8 has an essential function in the induction of type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines through TLR9 in pDCs and cDCs [155]. However, in cDCs, secretion of IFN-\u03b2 and inflammatory cytokines in a TLR7- and/or TLR9-MyD88-dependent manner is mediated by IRF1 and IRF5 [10,11]. Interestingly, protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons (PACSIN) 1 is specifically expressed in pDCs and represents a pDC-specific adaptor molecule that plays an important role in TLR7- and TLR9-mediated type I IFN responses in vitro and in vivo [8].",

An E2 ubiquitin ligase, Ubc5, is required for IRF3 activation by catalyzing K63-type ubiquitin chain formation [157]. Degradation of TRAF3 is responsible for the activation of MAPKs and NF-\u03baB, and the production of inflammatory cytokines through proteasome-dependent mechanisms [156]. Mitochondrial protein MARCH5, a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase, catalyzes K63-linked poly-ubiquitination of TANK and positively modulates TLR7 signaling by attenuating TANK and inhibiting TRAF6 [158]. Viperin, an IFN-inducible antiviral protein, interacts with IRAK1 and TRAF6 to recruit them to lipid bodies and facilitates K63-linked ubiquitination of IRAK1 to induce nuclear translocation of transcription factor IRF7, thereby promoting TLR7- and TLR9-mediated type I IFN production in pDCs [159]. Furthermore, modification of TANK by the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) is triggered by the kinase activity of IKK\u025b and TBK1 after stimulation of TLR7 ligands, which in turn weakens the interaction with IKK\u025b and thus relieves the negative effect of TANK on signal propagation [160].",

The second RING protein, tripartite motif protein 30\u03b1 (TRIM30\u03b1), functions as a negative regulator of TLR-mediated NF-\u03baB activation by targeting TAB2 and TAB3 degradation in a ubiquitin-proteasome-independent pathway [166].

A20, a cytoplasmic zinc \ufb01nger protein, is one of the deubiquitin enzymes (DUBs) of the ovarian tumor (OTU) family. As a deubiquitinating enzyme A20 can remove K63-polyubiquitin chains from TRAF6 to turn off the NF-\u03baB signaling. A20 also has a unique E3 ligase activity that allows it to catalyze K48-polyubiquitination to degrade RIP1 in a proteasome-dependent manner after cleavage of K63-polyubiquitin chains to restrict NF-\u03baB activation [167]. Another important function of A20 is to disrupt the interaction of E3 ligases (TRAF6, TRAF2, TRAF3, IKK complex, and cIAP1/2) with E2 conjugating enzymes (Ubc13 and Ubc5hc), which results in effective downregulation of the NF-\u03baB-signaling pathway [168]. Furthermore, A20 has also been reported to negatively regulate IFN-\u03b2 transcription by inhibiting IRF3 activation [169]. Two other important deubiquitinating enzymes, deubiquitinating enzyme A and cyclindomatosis, are involved in the negative regulation of IFN-\u03b2 production by removing a K63-polyubiquitin chain from TBK1 and inhibiting the activation of TRAF3 and IRFs [170,171].",

Interestingly, another member of the TLR family, a protein-recognizing receptor TLR11, was also recently found to be expressed in the ER along with UNC93B1, TLR11 regulates the activation of DCs in response to protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii profilin (PFTG) [188], suggesting that in addition to nucleic acid-sensing TLRs, UNC93B1 also regulates at least one protein-sensing TLR in intracellular compartments. Although this knowledge is needed for our understanding of nucleic acid-sensing TLRs defense against protozoan parasites, further studies are needed to dissect whether TLR11 is trafficked from the ER to endosomal compartments by UNC93B1 to detect foreign nucleic acids, and the molecular mechanism of TLR11 activation by PFTG and T. gondii or others protozoan parasites. A surprising finding from recent experiments is that VACV and its poly(A)/T-rich DNA motifs are potent inducers of pDC-derived IFN-\u03b1 in a TLR9-independent, and exclusively TLR8-dependent pathway [12]. Although it is not clear why the recognition of VACV/modified VACV Ankara (MVA) and ECTV in pDC is mediated through different TLRs and whether TLR8-mediated recognition of VACV by non-pDCs is important in VACV control in humans, these result may reflect differences between VACV/MVA and ECTV in terms of their genetic compositions and endosomal trafficking pathways, and that different pathogens have evolved to adopt different mechanisms to effectively activate the innate immune system.",

On the one hand, \u2018self\u2019-derived nucleic acids form nucleic acid\u2013protein immune complexes (ICs) with a variety of endogenous proteins such as autoantibodies, anti-microbial peptides, small ribonucleoprotein (snRNPs), and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1), they may become resistant to nucleases and reach endosomal nucleic acid-sensing TLRs, leading to autoimmune reaction [1\u20133,189\u2013190]. On the other hand, imbalance between positive and negative regulators of the TLR-associated may disrupt immune homeostasis, resulting in autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, intracellular traf\ufb01cking of TLR7 and TLR9 from the ER to endosomes is also induced by LPS, which may increase the possibility of autoimmune diseases [186]. Furthermore, autophagy is not only important for the degradation of intracellular pathogens, cellular proteins, and organelles, but also for the regulation of nucleic acid-sensing TLR-mediated recognition of pathogens in multiple ways. However, autophagy can be also exploited by a diverse array of pathogens, which interfere with autophagy-mediated degradation of intracellular pathogens and substrate recognition by nucleic acid-sensing TLR, and suppress or escape the host's antiviral innate immune response. However, a detailed understanding of how such pathogens achieve these feats will need to be elucidated in future studies.",

However, very little is known about possible crosstalk between nucleic acid-sensing TLRs and these PRRs. Therefore, future studies should aim to improve our understanding of innate immune systems and immunobiology, including host-pathogen interactions, crosstalk between immune networks and their influence on the development of adaptive immunity. Such studies will likely also reveal information essential for the identification and development of novel anti-pathogen targets, therapeutic strategies, and better adjuvant for vaccines.",

Upon stimulation, TLR3 recruits TRIF, which in turn recruits a set of adaptor molecules lead to the formation of a complex and the activation of IRF3, NF-\u03baB, and AP-1. However, TLRs 7, 8, 9, and 13 interact with the TIR domain of MyD88 to recruit a set of adaptor molecules lead to the formation of a complex and the activation of IRF7, NF-\u03baB, and AP-1. To achieve a balanced output, TLR3, 7, 8, 9, and 13 signaling pathways are positively and negatively regulated by modulatory molecules, such as A20, deubiquitinating enzyme A, SARM, SHP-2, Nrdp1, and Ubc5.",
