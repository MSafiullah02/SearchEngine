The disease was similar to childhood-onset Still\u2019s disease (today called systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SoJIA)), which was described a century ago by Sir John Still2. Although the exact pathogenic mechanisms of the disease are unknown, substantial advances have been made to confirm the homology between AoSD and SoJIA; and AoSD has become the archetype of non-familial, or sporadic, systemic autoinflammatory disorders3\u20135.",

The term autoimmunity was used to refer to adaptive immunity and was defined as aberrant dendritic cell, B cell and T cell responses in primary and secondary lymphoid organs leading to a break in tolerance and development of immune reactivity towards native antigens (with autoantibodies in most cases). The term autoinflammation was used to refer to innate immunity and was defined as dysregulated activation of macrophages and neutrophils in response to a danger signal leading to tissue damage. These categories represent a continuum, which enabled a new classification of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders to be refined in subsequent years3,5.",

By contrast, no specific biomarker exists for systemic autoinflammatory disorders. The definition mainly relies on similarities with monogenic, hereditary periodic fever syndromes, which were at the origin of the concept. Autoinflammatory diseases have several key features, including intense inflammation with periodic fever, tissue inflammation depending on the disease, increased leukocyte and neutrophil counts, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level, a pathogenic function of the inflammasome and a therapeutic response to IL-1 blockade7\u20139. Aside from monogenic familial syndromes, Crohn\u2019s disease was the first classified non-familial polygenic autoinflammatory disorder10,11. A few years later, Still\u2019s disease (SoJIA and AoSD) was described as another non-familial autoinflammatory disorder, becoming one of the most characteristic polygenic systemic autoinflammatory disorders4,12.",

These danger signals are transmitted to macrophages and neutrophils via specific Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that activate specific inflammasomes, probably NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), leading to caspase activation and overproduction of active IL-1\u03b29,14\u201316. This step seems to be central to the pathogenesis of AoSD and leads to intense innate immune cell activation and overproduction of several pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IL-18 and TNF9,14\u201316 (Fig. 1). Several factors actively contribute to an amplified inflammatory response, which is often referred to as the cytokine \u2018burst\u2019 or \u2018storm\u2019 (refs4,16). In addition to IL-1 itself conferring retrograde activation of macrophages and neutrophils, different alarmins such as the S100 proteins (with S100A12 seeming to be more specific to SoJIA) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are involved in these processes14,16\u201320. Aside from amplification mechanisms, deficiency or failure in regulatory or anti-inflammatory mechanisms might be involved in the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases, including deficiency in regulatory T cells or natural killer cells, insufficient IL-10 production and deficiency in clearance of lipid mediators or production of soluble receptors of AGEs (sRAGEs) or other resolution-associated molecular patterns (RAMPs)21\u201324.",

The disease is present in different geographical regions and different ethnic groups4,5,13,14,27. Association studies have suggested a predisposing genetic background; however, no functional analysis has confirmed this hypothesis4,14,28. Two major findings have been reported in patients with SoJIA. First, a homoallelic missense mutation in LACC1 (which encodes the enzyme laccase domain-containing protein 1, a multicopper oxidoreductase) has been identified in 13 patients with SoJIA from 5 consanguineous families in Saudi Arabia29. This oxidoreductase promotes fatty-acid oxidation, with concomitant inflammasome activation, mitochondrial and NADPH-oxidase-dependent production of reactive oxygen species and bactericidal activity of macrophages30. Second, a large association study of 982 children with SoJIA and 8,010 healthy individuals identified a strong association between SoJIA and different HLA-DRB1*11 haplotypes, which all encode glutamate 58 (ref.31). This finding is unexpected, as it would implicate the involvement of adaptive immunity in the pathogenesis of Still\u2019s disease. However, it is unclear whether the same risk alleles are also associated with AoSD32. Finally, the substantial advances made in exploring the human genome will facilitate the identification of potential mutations in genes involved in autoinflammatory pathways, including de novo germinal mutations or somatic mutations occurring during fetus development or after birth33,34.",

In the Japanese study, the incidence was estimated at ~1 affected person per million in the mid-1990s. Initially, the disease was characterized as affecting only young adults (that is, 16\u201335 years of age1); however, other series have identified cases in adults >35 years old and even in people >60 years old37\u201341. The sex ratio is almost balanced, with only a slight female predominance37,39\u201343. However, because of the substantial advances in AoSD diagnosis as well as differential diagnoses during the past two decades, these older prevalence and incidence estimates might be outdated, and new studies are needed to update these figures.",

Although hyperferritinaemia was first considered suggestive of AoSD, several studies have shown that hyperferritinaemia, whatever the threshold used, has a poor positive predictive value in isolation without a suggestive context54,55. Furthermore, some researchers have suggested that conditions such as AoSD, RHL, catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome and septic shock should be included under a common syndrome entity termed \u2018hyperferritinaemic syndrome\u2019 to underline the pro-inflammatory function of ferritin56. Indeed, ferritin has been hypothesized to have a pathogenic function: high serum levels of this protein, as detected in these four clinical conditions, might contribute to the development of a cytokine storm57,58. Indeed, in hepatic stellate cells, exogenous ferritin has been shown to activate the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signalling pathway, leading to pro-inflammatory (including IL-1\u03b2) cytokine production58. High ferritin levels have also been shown to contribute to the development of a cytokine storm through a loop mechanism in which the inflammatory properties of ferritin are exacerbated14. The high levels of ferritin observed during inflammation result from increased production by histiocytes and macrophages and increased release from damaged hepatocytes. Many cytokines regulate the ferritin synthesis, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, TNF, IFN\u03b3 and IL-6. Interestingly, all these cytokines are involved in AoSD pathogenesis; levels of these cytokines in patients with AoSD positively correlate with disease activity, as do ferritin levels14. Hence, ferritin could be a mechanistic biomarker (that is, directly involved in the pathogenic mechanism) and not just a descriptive biomarker16.",

However, in AoSD, the GF level is markedly decreased (<20%), which suggests the involvement of other mechanisms. Extensive data indicate 78% sensitivity and 64% specificity of a GF level \u226420% for AoSD diagnosis54. The combination of hyperferritinaemia and a GF level \u226420% yields 67% sensitivity and 84% specificity54. Of note, although serum ferritin levels fluctuate according to systemic inflammation, GF levels remain low for several weeks to months after disease remission60. However, as mentioned, low GF level is not completely specific to AoSD and also occurs in other inflammatory processes such as severe systemic infections48.

The Yamaguchi criteria, published in 1992, are the most widely used71 (Table 3); however, these criteria include exclusion criteria such as infections, malignancies and other rheumatic diseases. Thus, they should be used only after a broad diagnostic work-up, which is problematic in clinical practice.

Although the evidence for efficacy of anakinra is unproven in classical, double-blinded controlled trials, the overall number of (>250) published cases provides convincing results. In fact, a clear and sustained improvement has been described for systemic and arthritic symptoms in most treated patients85\u201390. Systemic features seem to show a more rapid response, whereas prolonged exposure of several weeks usually seems to be required for improvement of arthritis. Of major importance for long-term safety were consistent reports of a reduction or even discontinuation of glucocorticoids as well as NSAIDs. In this context, meta-analyses from eight case series and three national surveys (meeting predefined quality standards and including >100 patients with AoSD treated with anakinra) showed a remission rate of ~80% and a reduced use of steroids in ~35% of patients91. A large observational retrospective multicentre study from Italy added further evidence for a strong effect on disease activity using the Pouchot score as well as clinical and serological features, regardless of sex, age, disease pattern or co-medication as outcome measures20. In February 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended a change to the terms of the marketing authorization for anakinra; notably, the indication is now broad, including both AoSD and SoJIA, with active systemic features of moderate to high disease activity, or patients with continued disease activity after treatment with NSAIDs or glucocorticoids92.",

Such statements must be handled with care, however, as patients with arthritis-predominant AoSD usually respond well to IL-1 blockers and patients with systemic-predominant AoSD are also likely to respond to IL-6 receptor blockers.",

New insights have been obtained into the complex and heterogeneous nature of AoSD with data on genetic association, involvement of the innate immune system and the cytokine profile. Consequently, several established and new promising targeted therapies are in development for AoSD. However, no reliable prediction of the response and outcome is possible yet, and therapeutic decisions have to be made on the basis of clinical, biological or imaging characteristics. The coming years will probably contribute to a better understanding of the disease and its complications, notably a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and identification of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and of new targets for preventing both life-threatening manifestations and chronicity. Owing to obvious similarities between SoJIA and AoSD, these diseases may represent a disease continuum, and thus a close cooperation between paediatric and adult rheumatologists is desirable to establish common diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and approaches.",

This excessive activation of NLRP3 seems to be central and leads to intense production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. These cytokines intensely stimulate innate immune cell activation, as well as adaptive immune cells, leading to overproduction of several pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and TNF, as well as further production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Several factors actively contribute to this amplified inflammatory response, which is often referred to as the cytokine \u2018burst\u2019 or \u2018storm\u2019. In addition to IL-1\u03b2 itself conferring retrograde activation of macrophages and neutrophils, alarmins such as the S100 proteins and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are involved. Aside from the amplification mechanisms, deficiency or failure in regulatory or anti-inflammatory mechanisms might be involved in the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases, including deficiency in regulatory T (Treg) cells or natural killer (NK) cells, insufficient IL-10 production and deficiency in production of resolving lipid mediators, soluble receptors of AGEs (sRAGEs) or other resolution-associated molecular patterns (RAMPs). Hence, adult-onset Still\u2019s disease (AoSD) pathogenesis is related to an imbalance between inflammation and resolution.
