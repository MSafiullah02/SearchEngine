Because disease causation is context dependent, the interactions within and among populations of vertebrates in the causation and transmission of emerging zoonotic diseases is inherently dynamic, interdependent, and systems based. Beyond the population dynamics, feedback among exposures and outcomes are integral to wider causal webs of the natural environment, and that generates context-dependent effects. Further, causal effects on individual and population levels are impacted by herd immunity and the threshold density of the cause. At an individual level, causal effects depend on the distribution of population-level effects, although, population-level effects are not equivalent to the sum of individual-level effects [9].",

Nevertheless, they are still recognized as the starting point of many new causal explanations for emerging zoonoses. On the contrary, Bradford Hill\u2019s criteria cannot be used to dismiss the assumption of a causal relation. The most recent description of Bradford Hill\u2019s causality criteria, given by Rothman and Greenland [18] lists the following nine causality criteria which are applied to emerging zoonoses: (1) strength of the association: the stronger the association, the more likely that the association is causal and a weak association would be easier to imagine as an unmeasured confounder. However, a strong association is neither necessary nor sufficient for a cause and a weak association is neither necessary nor sufficient for the absence of causality. (2) Consistency: if more studies find similar results, the more likely it is that the association is causal. Nonetheless, lack of consistency does not rule out a causal association since some effects are produced under unusual circumstances. (3) Specificity: a specific exposure exerts a specific effect. (4) Temporality: the causal exposure should precede the disease in time and this is an inarguable criterion. (5) Biological gradient or dose response: associations of trend with increasing levels of exposure are more likely but not necessarily causal. (6) Plausibility: depends on the current knowledge of the etiology of the disease. The causal inference must be made from not only epidemiology, but also with inputs from toxicology, pharmacology, basic biology, and other sciences. (7) Coherence: refers to other observed biological effects, possibly relevant in the etiologic pathway, that makes a causal association more likely, for instance, histological changes in the target organ. (8) Experimental evidence: to Hill, experimental evidence meant a reduction in the disease rates after the causal agent has been eliminated. (9) Analogy: if a similar agent exerts similar effects, it is more likely that the association is causal.",

However, he considered the criteria as ambivalent, and pondered if any other way of explaining the cause and effect exists. In addition, Poole [19] stated that there are no universal and objective causal criteria and are yet to be identified. Therefore, considering the drivers of emerging zoonoses, population level effects and construing a cause of a disease as a factor, event, characteristic or condition that affects its incidence [5], the following supportive criteria or viewpoints to strengthen the causal explanation of emerging zoonoses may be considered: (1) outbreak: sudden increase in incidence of unknown disease; (2) species specificity: humans and type of animal species affected; (3) basic reproduction number (R0): measured to discern the speed of travel (transmission) of the pathogen; and (4) virulence of the pathogen: measured by case fatality rate.",
