Current COVID-19 tests detect one or more targets in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, usually by real-time RT-PCR, and nasopharyngeal swabs have been the preferred sample for testing to date (1). While PCR-based tests are highly sensitive, the false-negative COVID-19 testing rate by nasopharyngeal swab (2) was nevertheless estimated to be >30% in a recent study (3) , though the report in question had not yet undergone peer review. Factors other than the molecular technology contribute to test sensitivity, including the timing of sample collection with respect to infection stage (4) as well as specimen storage and transport (2) . Improper specimen collection could also contribute to false negative COVID-19 test results. Although nasopharyngeal swabs are routinely ordered for respiratory viruses, the collection of a high quality specimen requires training and expertise as it involves insertion of the swab to posterior nasopharynx, a depth of roughly 7cm, followed by rotation and withdrawal of the swab (5) . To investigate suboptimal sample collection as a possible cause of false negative test results, we quantified human DNA levels recovered on nasopharyngeal swabs submitted to a single laboratory for COVID-19 testing, hypothesizing that human DNA could serve as a stable molecular marker of specimen collection quality.",

For comparison we tested a convenience sample of 87 consecutively submitted nasopharyngeal swabs for which >1mL medium remained. Remnant specimens were stored at -20\u00b0C until re-testing. To standardize nucleic acid extraction methodology across all specimens and to maximize SARS-CoV-2 RNA recovery and concentration, one milliliter of each remnant specimen was extracted on the BioM\u00e9rieux EasyMag and eluted in 35\u00b5L buffer. SARS-CoV-2 detection in suspect false negative samples was re-attempted using a nested RT-PCR and sequencing protocol targeting conserved regions in ORF-1a and Spike (8) . Human DNA levels were quantified using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), a technique where each sample is fractionated into 20,000 nanolitre-sized water-in-oil droplets prior to PCR amplification with sequence-specific primers and fluorescent probes. Droplets are assayed at endpoint, after which Poisson statistics are used to calculate input template concentrations. The protocol was originally developed to quantify human genome copy numbers .

Our results underscore the importance of proper training and technique in the collection of high quality nasopharyngeal specimens. They also highlight the potential utility of including a molecular marker of sampling quality in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic RT-PCR assays. While the major commercial diagnostic assays include internal controls, these do not necessarily measure specimen quality. In the Roche cobas\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 assay for example (https://www.fda.gov/media/136049), an armored RNA construct is spiked into specimens. Its subsequent detection confirms the validity of nucleic acid extraction and RT-PCR amplification, but does not provide a measure of biological sampling quality. The US CDC COVID-19 test includes a human RNAseP RNA-specific primer/probe set to assess sampling quality, but the results are interpreted qualitatively (7) . Specifically, the most recent US-CDC's instructions for use (issued 15-Mar-2020) states that failure to detect RNAseP within 40 PCR cycles can denote improper assay set up, poor nucleic RNA yield/quality after extraction, and/or the absence of sufficient human cellular material in the sample due to poor specimen collection or storage. As where the 90th percentile C t value was 26.10. Thus, even the lowest decile of samples in terms of RNAseP RNA levels (possibly representing those for which sampling was the least robust) still amplified well before C t <40, suggesting that this threshold may be insufficient to assess biological sampling quality. It is important to note however that our study was not designed to identify a threshold of human DNA (or RNA) that could define a properly-collected SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab. Future studies attempting to do so would need to consider that recovery .

Note that there are only two samples in the indeterminate category, as the third re-tested partially positive by nested RT-PCR, and therefore was excluded from human DNA analysis.
