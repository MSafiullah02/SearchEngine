            "text": "\nPenicillium marneffei is the agent of a life-threatening systemic mycosis known as penicilliosis marneffei, occurring in patients infected with HIV in Southeast Asia (Supparatpinyo et al., 1994; Wong et al., 1998; Liyan et al., 2004) and now recognized as an AIDS-defining disease (Lee, 2008). Cases were particularly frequent in endemic zones of northern Thailand (Watanabe et al., 2008), but the disease has also been observed in China (Fisher et al., 2005). Since the first reported Chinese case in 1985 (Wei, 1985), there has been a drastic increase in the incidence of the infection, concomitant with the emergence of the AIDS pandemic. More than 100 cases of AIDS with penicilliosis marneffei were reported between 2003 and 2006 in a single hospital in Guangzhou (Linghua Li & Weiping, 2008). Clinical diagnosis may be hampered by the fact that major manifestations of the mycosis in HIV-infected patients are not specific for P. marneffei. As a result, many patients do not receive timely and appropriate antifungal treatment, and their prognosis is poor. Traditionally, penicilliosis marneffei is diagnosed by a microscopic observation of fungal fission yeast cells in alveolar macrophages and by culturing the etiologic agent. These procedures may be time-consuming (Ukarapol et al., 1998; Mo et al., 2002), and there is a need for experimental diagnostic methods. Serological diagnosis (Panichakul et al., 2002) is tedious because it requires paired, acute- and convalescent-phase sera, and the results may be influenced by contamination or cross-reaction. Several molecular methods have been proposed, such as nested or semi-nested PCR (LoBuglio & Taylor, 1995; Vanittanakom et al., 2002; Prariyachatigul et al., 2003), PCR-enzyme immunoassays (Lindsley et al., 2001) and PCR hybridization (Vanittanakom et al., 1998). All have been developed on the basis of cultured material, and require a fully equipped molecular laboratory. Thus, there is still a need for a rapid and simple technique that is able to deliver an unambiguous identification within a single day.",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was introduced for the detection of hepatitis B virus DNA by Notomi (2000). This novel technique is able to amplify DNA with high specificity, efficiency and rapidity under isothermal conditions. The assay is based on the use of Bst DNA polymerase, performing autocycling strand displacement DNA synthesis using a set of four or six specially designed primers that recognize six or eight distinct sequences on the target DNA. The cycling reactions result in the accumulation of 109- to 1010-fold amplification of the target in less than an hour. Amplification products can be detected easily by visual assessment of turbidity in Eppendorf vials or by electrophoresis. The sensitivity of LAMP does not appear to be affected by the presence of nontarget DNA in samples, and there is no interference by known PCR inhibitors such as blood, serum, plasma or heparin (Notomi et al., 2000; Enosawa et al., 2003; Poon et al., 2005). These properties of high specificity, selectivity, simplicity and speed made LAMP attractive for the diagnosis of bacteria (Iwamoto et al., 2003; Yoshida et al., 2005; Aoi et al., 2006), viruses (Poon et al., 2004; Hagiwara et al., 2007; Cai et al., 2008) and parasites (Ikadai et al., 2004; Iseki et al., 2007). However, very few papers have appeared on the use of LAMP with fungi (Endo et al., 2004; Ohori et al., 2006; Inacio et al., 2008). We recently developed a protocol for LAMP detection for Fonsecaea agents of chromoblastomycosis (Sun, 2009). In the present study, we introduce LAMP diagnostics for P. marneffei in paraffin wax-embedded human tissue and in bamboo rat tissue samples.",

Cases from human patients were confirmed by routine and molecular identification methods. Penicillium marneffei was also isolated from 10 of 11 bamboo rat tissue samples; one (bamboo rat liver) was used as a negative control.

Most developments in molecular diagnostics published recently concerned improvements in PCR methodology on DNA extracted from pure cultures or from clinical specimens. This had led to changes in the primer design and reaction temperature (Boehme et al., 2007; Inacio et al., 2008) and to integration with hybridization and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques (Nagamine et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2009). In the present study, we further developed and evaluated the LAMP assay, exemplified by the detection and identification of P. marneffei in DNA from pure cultures as well as in paraffin wax-embedded tissues. Compared with any detection method applied thus far, the method is very fast, as it can be carried out within 1 h. It also does not require expensive laboratory equipment, because the method can be carried out isothermally at 65 \u00b0C in a water bath. Further, it is simple to use in a routine laboratory, as the results can be observed directly by the naked eye (Fig. 3). In addition, the detection limit is very low. With only two DNA copies, it has a higher sensitivity than the currently applied molecular methods, such as semi-nested PCR (10 pg) (Prariyachatigul et al., 2003), PCR enzyme immunoassay (3.2 pg) (Lindsley et al., 2001), PCR hybridization (0.1 pg) (Vanittanakom et al., 1998) and nested PCR (0.07 pg) (Zeng et al., 2009).",
