Transfection of SARS-CoV spike into Vero E6, HEK293T and HL-CZ cells leads to strong expression of the glycosylated spike protein, as shown by Western blot analyses and immunofluorescent imaging using spike-specific human monoclonal antibodies, indicating the potential utility of these antigens and antibodies as diagnostic reagents. Furthermore, we employed cDNA microarray analysis to probe the changes in host gene transcription attributed to transfection of a codon-optimized spike construct into the HL-CZ cell line of monocyte lineage that is linked to immunological responses. A diverse representation of 100 genes displayed altered transcriptional patterns in response to SARS-CoV spike expression, with 61 upregulated and 39 downregulated genes. Genes involved in intracellular trafficking, signaling, modulation or transcription were generally upregulated. In contrast, genes involved in cell metabolism and cytoskeleton formation were notably downregulated. The transcripts of other functional categories exhibited varied responses to SARS-CoV spike transfection. Collectively, our analyses elucidate numerous and complex transcriptomic events that occur in response to spike protein expression and that contribute towards SARS-CoV pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Comprising 1,255 amino acid residues, the SARS-CoV spike is the first protein to interact with the host membrane, culminating in a cascade of infection events. Given that this glycoprotein plays a crucial role in viral virulence and pathogenesis, its functions have been extensively characterized, and it is probably the most important viral target for vaccine design (Du et al. 2009 ). Containing intracellular, extracellular and transmembrane domains, the spike protein is classified as a type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein that is responsible for virus binding, fusion and entry (Simmons et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2004; Zhou et al. 2004) . Of particular interest and importance is the S1 unit which constitutes one of the two subunits of the extracellular domain. This domain is responsible for binding of the virus to its main receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), present on susceptible cells (Li et al. 2003; Babcock et al. 2004) . Moreover, CD209L (L-SIGN) and DC-SIGN also facilitate cell entry of SARS-CoV (Jeffers et al. 2004; Shih et al. 2006) . SARS-CoV spike is selectively recognized by pulmonary surfactant D and activates macrophages (Leth-Larsen et al. 2007 ). Vero E6 cells are derived from the African green monkey kidney clone E6, and are the most permissive for SARS-CoV infection and replication. Human cell lines that are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection include LoVo, HepG2 and Huh-7. The lytic infection produced in Vero E6 cells mimics the apoptosis observed in the respiratory epithelial cells of severely ill SARS patients (Leong et al. 2005; Chow and Leong 2008) . In contrast, persistent infection of LoVo cells does not exhibit visible cytopathic effect (CPE).",

Antibody-binding regions (Fab or scFv) are cloned as fusions of the phage M13 coat proteins. The procedure results in the isolation of genes encoding antibody-binding regions specific for the target antigen. These genes can be used for the construction of fully human immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., phage libraries can be either na\u00efve or immune. The latter library is generated using antibody genes extracted from the B cells of an immunized donor or from a convalescent patient. Both methods may yield antibodies that can be employed for therapeutic applications (Hoogenboom 2002 ). An immune scFv phage library was constructed from the lymphocytes of a convalescent Singapore SARS patient with high neutralizing antibody titers. Briefly, several hundred scFv clones were checked for specific binding to inactivated SARS-CoV. After further selection, binding affinities of monovalent scFv were estimated, and scFv-binding epitopes were mapped. Finally, V regions were cloned into IgG expression vectors for the expression of human IgG 1 molecules in the human PER.C6 cell line.",

The construction of this codon-optimized SARS-CoV spike ectodomain is more effective for spike protein expression during transfection in mammalian cells by replacing the natural codons with optimum codons ). HL-CZ is a suspension cell line derived from human promonocytic leukemia that possesses CD15, CD34 and CD11b markers, and is permissive for the propagation of dengue virus, influenza virus type A and HIV-1 (Lai et al. 2007 ). Twenty-four hours after cell seeding, one batch of HL-CZ cells was transiently transfected with pCon-S-Harv-Myc-His using TransFectin (Bio-Rad), while another batch was mock-transfected with pcDNA3.1 only as control. Protein samples of both batches were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the human monoclonal antibodies to SARS-CoV spike. Among the 16 antibodies, the antibody designated pgG103-057C03P01 detected a single distinct band of~180 kDa compatible with the glycosylated spike ectodomain in the total cell lysate and pellet of HL-CZ cells transfected with SARS-CoV spike, but not in the corresponding samples of cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 control. With the pgG103-057C03P01 antibody, Western blotting also revealed intense SARS-CoV spike bands in both the lysate and supernatant of spike-transfected human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells. These immunoblot results were further confirmed by using spike polyclonal antibody IMG-541 (Imgenex) which detected a weaker spike protein band ( Fig. 18.1 ).",

Confocal microscopy revealed the wide distribution of spike in the cytoplasm of Vero E6 and HL-CZ cells transfected with pCon-S-Harv-Myc-His. The intense immunostaining in the cytoplasm of HL-CZ cells may be attributed to spike localization in smooth membrane vesicles or smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

            "text": "Another notable upregulated transcript (~2.2-fold) is histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) which also plays an important role in chromatin remodeling. Whether a cell is permissive for viral infection may be dependent on the state of cellular differentiation. For example, permissiveness for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is linked to repression of the viral major immediate early promoter (MIEP). In HCMV, monocytes represent a site of viral latency in HCMV carriers, and reactivated virus is only observed upon differentiation into macrophages. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved in MIEP repression in nonpermissive cells, since inhibition of HDACs induces viral permissiveness and increases MIEP activity (Murphy et al. 2002) . HDACs modulate MIEP transcriptional activity by affecting the acetylation of transcriptional factors as well as histones. A related protein, HDAC6, regulates formation of the HIV-mediated fusion pore. Binding of the HIV gp120 protein to CD4-positive permissive cells increases the level of acetylated a-tubulin. Overexpression of active HDAC6 inhibits tubulin acetylation, thus preventing HIV-1 envelope-dependent cell fusion as well as infection without affecting the expression of other HIV-1 receptors (Valenzuela-Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2005) .",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-infected cells exhibit diminished expression of genes associated with the maintenance of cytoskeletal structure. Many cellular processes depend on cytoskeletal rearrangements. Villin 1 is a structural protein regulated by increased intracellular calcium that in turn binds to actin, and contributes to the formation of microvilli in the small intestine. Cytokeratins are part of the family of keratins consisting of about 20 different proteins that comprise intermediate filaments in almost all epithelial cells. These filaments form the internal infrastructure of cells and are vital for maintaining cellular integrity. Disruption of such features affects cellular flexibility, tensile strength and interaction with other cellular components (Glass et al. 2006) . Infection of animal cells by a number of viruses generally results in CPE. In lytic viral infections, there is a profound impairment of cell structural integrity, and inhibition of host protein synthesis related to widespread destruction of the intermediate filament network, e.g. proteolysis of cytokeratins K7 and K18 by the adenovirus late-acting L3 proteinase (Zhang and Schneider 1994) . The collapse of this network (including vimentin and lamin), coupled with suppression of new keratin synthesis to restore the damaged filament network, contributes to CPE. In SARS-CoV infection, these microtubule networks may become disrupted, making it conducive for subsequent viral release, partially attributed to the spike protein.",

Correct positioning of zyxin within the cell is also critical for its physiological function. Mislocation of zyxin affects cell migration and spreading, influences behavior of the cell edge, and causes irregular distribution of important proteins that promote actin assembly (Drees et al. 1999) . Furthermore, the b-actin transcript is upregulated~7.7-fold, suggesting the complex interplay between the various elements that contribute to structural integrity within the cell.",

Intriguingly, most of the transcriptional factors upregulated in response to spike transfection are zinc finger proteins. In contrast to live SARS-CoV infection, this study provides comparative insights into the host transcriptomic effects of the spike protein when expressed alone in relevant human cells, thus shedding light on its specific roles during viral infection. These data indicate that SARS-CoV spike expression significantly modifies the regulation of numerous genes in HL-CZ cells, reiterate its importance in SARS pathogenesis, and further justify it as a key target for vaccine development. Such studies can enhance our understanding of the \"infectomics\" of viral infections in different human and mammalian cell types. More in-depth analyses of the individual genes may be conducted by quantitative real-time RT-PCR to verify the microarray data, and by using gene-knockout animal models to further explore their specific roles in SARS-CoV infection in vivo.",
