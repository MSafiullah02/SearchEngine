The process of replicase-driven template switch is the most widely accepted mechanism of recombination (Ranjith-Kumar et al., 2002, Shapka and Nagy, 2004, Hu et al., 2003). Highly structured cis-acting replication elements stall the progressing RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex, which subsequently forces the dissociation of the replicase from the original template and promotes its re-initiation at the acceptor site on another template (Suzuki et al., 2003, Dedepsidis et al., 2010, Draghici and Varrelmann, 2010, Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska et al., 2011b). Studies with Brome mosaic virus (BMV) demonstrated that the homologous crossovers occur near the secondary structures, e.g., within a 3\u2032 tRNA-like structure (TLS), which appear to serve as roadblocks for the progression of RdRp. Interestingly, the effects were more evident during (+)-strand synthesis (Olsthoorn et al., 2002).",

The CP is expressed from subgenomic (sg) RNA4. The multipartite composition of BMV genome and the production of subgenomic RNAs make it a useful model for studies on RNA recombination. Both inter- or intra-segmental crossovers in BMV RNAs were observed at the 3\u2032 TLS (Nagy and Bujarski, 1994, Nagy and Bujarski, 1996, Nagy and Bujarski, 1997, Nagy and Bujarski, 1998). Moreover, the RNA3 subgenomic promoter (sgp) was mapped as an active recombination hot-spot (Wierzchoslawski et al., 2004), additionally engaged in the formation of nonreplicating 5\u2032 subgenomic RNA3a (sgRNA3a) (Wierzchoslawski et al., 2006). Recently, we reported the efficient homologous recombination between BMV sgRNA3a and genomic RNA3 in barley protoplasts (Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska et al., 2011a). Both in vitro and in vivo data suggested that the exposed 3\u2032 terminal polyA tail of sgRNA3a can prime the extension of (+) strand RNA synthesis on the (\u2212) sense RNA3 templates. In addition, more upstream regions also supported homologous crossover events, most likely by internal strand transfers during (\u2212) sense RNA synthesis.",

Another motif is a highly structured position-dependent RNA3 packaging element PE that is localized between nucleotides (nts) 550 and 820 and is considered as a selective domain for CP interaction facilitating specific packaging of BMV RNA3 (Choi and Rao, 2003). Since sgRNA3a represents an exact copy of the 5\u2032 half of (+) strand RNA3, it also carries these two cis-acting elements. In this work, we show that sequence alterations within both motifs, either on RNA3 and/or on the sgRNA3a components, diminished the recombination frequency in protoplasts. A series of reciprocal transfections revealed putative interactions between these motifs in establishing the crossover locations. Moreover, the transfection of protoplasts with the RNA mutants incapable of CP expression or that expressed the CP variants with altered domains recognizing the CP-binding motifs also reduced the recombination frequency. Our study offers novel insight into BMV RNA recombination and indicates that associations of CP with the RNA cis-acting motifs can mediate RNA recombination process.",

Similarly, the recombination frequency approached only 3%, with three recombinant RNA3 clones containing the 5\u2032 BamHI marker site, implying internal strand switching. Again, the level of RNA3 (Fig. 3\n, lane 6) was alike that of mut-RNA3, reflecting an equal availability of RNA3 substrate for crossovers. Overall, when compared with the 42% frequency between mut-RNA3 and SG, the lack of functional PE in RNA3 effectively reduced the recombination frequency to a marginal value, demonstrating the importance of the PE motif. However, the presence of the PE region in the sgRNA3a donor did not seem to be critical because both SG and PE-SG recombined at comparably low rate.",

The CP domains responsible for the binding to Bbox and SLC motifs were mapped (Yi et al., 2009b). To address whether the absence of CP affects sgRNA3a\u2013RNA3 recombination, CP0-RNA3 was created. CP0-RNA3 did not transcribe sgRNA4 due to mutations introduced within the sgRNA4 promoter region (+1 G to C and \u22122 A to C), as previously reported (Sivakumaran et al., 2004), and thus in the above system the expression of CP is debilitated. The results of disrupted sgRNA4 transcription along with an unaffected level of RNA3 accumulation in protoplasts are shown in Fig. 3 (compare lanes 12 and 13). Among four identified recombinants (per 100 analyzed cDNA clones), three acquired a complete set of SG-derived restriction markers, while one clone inherited only the central HindIII and the 3\u2032 PstI sites (Fig. 2E). This suggested that the remnant recombination activity could occur via extension of sgRNA3a serving as a primer during copying of progeny RNA3.",

To examine recombination frequency, both RNA3 CP mutants were co-transfected separately with SG in barley protoplasts. The CP-Bbox RNA3 generated the following recombinants: three carrying all sgRNA3a marker restriction sites (likely reflecting sgRNA3a extension on progeny RNA3), one carrying the 5\u2032 BamHI and the 3\u2032 PstI sites, and one carrying only the 5\u2032 BamHI site (Fig. 2F). In the case of CP-SLC RNA3, only one recombinant emerged, containing the inner HindIII site (Fig. 2G).

The protoplasts were thoroughly washed to remove the un-transfected radioactive material, and the total RNA was extracted at three time points. The stabilities of the RNA3 and sgRNA3a variants were assessed in comparison with the previously tested wt RNA3 and wt sgRNA3a transcripts. All of the transcript variants were stable to a similar degree within the 75 min assay time (Fig. 4\n), indicating that the observed frequencies during the protoplast assays reflected recombination rates rather than altered RNA stability.",

Equimolar concentrations of serially diluted (1; 1:10; 1:100; 1:1000) radioactive wt or mutated RNA3 probes (comprising the regions of individual cis-acting sequences, as shown on top of Fig. 5\n), were incubated with equimolar wt or mutated CP preparations. The complexes were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters, washed, and the bound radioactivity was determined via autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 5, the wt CP bound efficiently to wt and mutated full-length RNA3 probes (top section), as well as to wt PE (wt PE Fr) and to wt Bbox (wt Bbox Fr) RNA3 fragments (Fig. 5, second section, lines 1 and 2), because the interaction was at the detectable level even with 1:1000 diluted probe. This reflected the fact that more than one CP peptides were found to be cross-linked to the BMV RNAs by using the reversible cross-linking and peptide fingerprinting (RCAP) assays (Yi et al., 2009b). However, the deleted \u0394PE (\u0394PE Fr) and mutated Bbox (mut Bbox Fr) RNA3 fragments interacted at least 100 fold less efficiently with wt CP (Fig. 5, second section, lines 3 and 4, respectively) as the 1:10 diluted probes barely generated detectable signal. Likewise, the CP variant with mutated peptide recognizing Bbox motif (CP-Bbox) also bound inefficiently to both \u0394PE Fr and mut Bbox Fr probes (Fig. 5, third section, lines 3 and 4, respectively) and to an increased (three-fold) amount of wt Bbox Fr probe (line 1), yet binding to wt PE Fr was reasonably high (Fig. 5, line 2). This analysis revealed separate PE and Bbox binding sites on the CP molecule, which is consistent with the previously published data of Yi et al. (2009b). The CP-SLC mutant bound with relative efficiency to both wt PE and Bbox Fr (Fig. 5, bottom section, lines 1 and 2) but it bound with much less efficiency to the PE and Bbox mutated counterparts (Fig. 5, lines 3 and 4). Collectively, our data suggest that all three RNA3 motifs interact with separate regions on the BMV CP molecule, and confirm that the inhibition of CP binding parallels the diminished RNA3\u2013sgRNA3a recombination frequency.",

The mut-RNA3 \u00d7 SG experiment generated only six recombinants with more random distribution of three markers; thirteen carrying BamHI\u2013PstI double markers; one and two carrying (respectively) BamHI\u2013HindIII or HindIII\u2013PstI double markers; and eleven, one, and eight carrying (respectively) PstI, HindIII, or BamHI single markers. This suggested that crossovers happened near the 3\u2032 end of sgRNA3a or more internally, likely near the PE encapsidation region. Based on prior and current studies we speculated that recombination occurred by two mechanisms (Fig. 6A and B): (1) sgRNA3a-directed primer extension on (\u2212) strand RNA3, where the exposed 3\u2032 terminal regions of sgRNA3a would promote the template switch during (+) strand RNA synthesis, or by (2) strand switching between (+) strands [during (\u2212) strand synthesis] which could engage internal secondary structures of RNA3 and sgRNA3a. Here, the sgRNA3a would act as a \u201cdocking partner\u201d that anneals to the newly synthesized (\u2212) sense RNA3. Both, the BMV RdRp capability to participate in primer extension with sgRNA3a on (\u2212) RNA3 templates as well as its potency to switch among RNA templates were demonstrated previously in vitro (Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska et al., 2011a).",

Our recent data (Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska et al., 2011a) suggested that the RNA3 position-dependent packaging element (PE) (Choi and Rao, 2003, Annamalai and Rao, 2006) focuses the RNA3\u2013sgRNA3a crossovers. It was shown that removal of PE did not inhibit RNA3 accumulation in barley protoplasts (Choi and Rao, 2003). Here, we confirm that the deletion of a large portion of PE did not affect replication of RNA3 in protoplasts (Fig. 3) but it strongly debilitated recombination (transfection \u0394PE-RNA3 \u00d7 SG supported only 3% recombination frequency; Fig. 2A). Similarly, the \u0394PE-RNA3 \u00d7 \u0394PE-SG transfection, in which both constructs were missing the PE motif, generated only three recombinants, all carrying the 5\u2032 BamHI marker mutation. In contrast, when the same PE motif was deleted only in sgRNA3a (transfection Bbox-RNA3 \u00d7 \u0394PE-SG), this alteration was much less debilitating for recombination (reduction to 13%), likely as a combined effect with the mutated Bbox element (Fig. 2C) that was shown to increase recombination.",

Previously, it was shown that partial PE deletion eliminated RNA3 packaging (Choi and Rao, 2003). Since PE is functional only in (+) strands we speculate that the lack of CP binding to this motif might disrupt the initial interaction between the (+) strands of RNA3 and sgRNA3a, which in normal conditions would be supported via CP\u2013CP dimerization/oligomerization. BMV CP ability to bind small RNA motifs together with RdRp was previously proposed to regulate the timing of BMV RNA synthesis and viral encapsidation (Zhu et al., 2007). Additionally, BMV CP was shown to co-purify with BMV replicase (Bujarski et al., 1982), and both BMV CP and viral RNAs were found to co-localize at viral \u201creplication factories\u201d (Bamunusinghe et al., 2011, Schwartz et al., 2004, Diaz et al., 2012, Seo et al., 2012). The bound CP might then support RNA crossovers during replication inside the factories. In addition, the bound CP might create obstacles for the replicase complex and promote strand switching.",

However, mutations within the CP-Bbox binding region did not repress BMV RNA accumulation in vivo (Yi et al., 2009a). Additionally, its proximity to the RNA3 polyA region, previously shown to concentrate the crossovers (Wierzchoslawski et al., 2004), is suggestive of its involvement in RNA3\u2013sgRNA3a recombination. In our studies, the Bbox mutations debilitated recombination, but while occurring in sgRNA3a rather than in RNA3 (Fig. 2B). For the latter (Bbox-RNA3 \u00d7 SG) the frequency maintained the wt level (42%) (Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska et al., 2011a) with the majority of recombinants carrying all three marker mutations (32 out of 42 recombinants).

In addition, the sgRNA3a-bound CP might interact with the replicase complex that is already present at the subgenomic promoter, which would also facilitate primer extension. At the same time, CP binding at the internal RNA3 Bbox motif would create an obstacle for progressing RdRp supporting the inner strand switching process. In addition, the presence of the polyA tail in sgRNA3a primer might be essential.

Along these lines, a reverse transfection with Bbox-RNA3 \u00d7 \u0394PE-SG generated recombinants that carried all three sgRNA3a markers; again reflecting the sgRNA3a-directed primer extension on (\u2212) templates. Since the Bbox-RNA3 \u00d7 \u0394PE-SG experiment supported the crossovers near the 3\u2032 end of sgRNA3a we conclude that the unmodified sgRNA3a Bbox structure supported primer extension due to binding to both BMV CP and BMV replicase proteins. Additionally, the lack of CP binding to the modified Bbox in RNA3 likely removes the road block for BMV replicase, and thus prevents the RdRp from inner strand switching. The results from the Bbox-RNA3 \u00d7 SG co-transfection experiment (76% recombinants with all three marker sites) agree with the lines of this hypothesis.",

Analogous motif was also reported at the 5\u2032 UTR of RNA3 (Pogue et al., 1992); however, its CP-binding activity was not reported. Here we show that mutations in the Bbox like element did not affect the level of RNA3 (+) strands in protoplasts (Fig. 3). Similar observations were reported by Pogue et al. (1992) after deleting the 5\u2032 Bbox like sequence from BMV RNA3. Apparently, this region does not participate in the initiation of RNA3 (+) strands. However, two co-transfections involving RNA3 and/or sgRNA3a 5\u2032box-like mutants (5\u2032box-RNA3 \u00d7 5\u2032box-SG and 5\u2032box-RNA3 \u00d7 SG) dramatically debilitated recombination (none and one recombinant, respectively, per 100 clones; Fig. 2D). These results complement our previously published low recombination rates with the 3\u2032-nested sgRNA3a derivatives that were lacking the 5\u2032 Bbox-like motif (Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska et al., 2011a). The effect of the disruption of the 5\u2032 Bbox-like sequence on sgRNA3a\u2013RNA3 recombination might be due to changes in the entire topology (structure and/or communication with other motifs) of the recombining RNAs, making them less prone to crossovers. These possibilities will be a subject of further experimentation.",

The corresponding recombination frequency was at very low level (Fig. 2E).

Similar to CP-Bbox, the recombination frequency with CP-SLC was very low after co-transfecting with wt sgRNA3a (Fig. 2G). Collectively, these observations revealed that either the lack of CP or the disrupted binding of CP molecules to their cognate RNA binding signals debilitated significantly the recombination activity. One can speculate that the 3\u2032 SLC-bound CP increases the interaction between sgRNA3a and RNA3 molecules via long distance oligomerization (dashed arrow in Fig. 6B). Under this scenario, the strand switching during (\u2212) strand synthesis could be facilitated.

            "text": "In conclusion, our data reveal important role of CP in homologous BMV RNA recombination and both mechanisms, the sgRNA3a-mediated primer extension and internal strand switching. As regarding the biological meaning of homologous crossovers with subgenomic components, these mechanisms can serve as an efficient strategy that RNA viruses may use to diversify their RNA genomes and/or to guard the integrity of viral genome. It allows them to not only shuffle their genes so to adjust to ever-changing environment, but also to exploit subgenomic components as potential backup in case of extensive damage of their replication-competent genomic RNAs. The fact that BMV utilizes its multifunctional CP to orchestrate recombination proves once more the economical nature of virus life cycle under the limited resources. It is possible that CP-mediated recombination might be a common process among (+) stranded RNA viruses. The accumulating evidence demonstrates close proximity of viral RNA replication and CP translation inside the host cell (Annamalai et al., 2008, Seo et al., 2012). Thus, it is tempting to assume that RNA recombination processes are linked not only spatially but also they share protein factors. Yet, further studies are necessary to define more details of these mechanisms.",

(A) Model of primer extension of sgRNA3a on (\u2212) RNA3 templates. The BMV RdRp complex primes the hybridized sgRNA3a molecule and continues its translocation until completion on (\u2212) RNA3 template. Both the Bbox element and the polyA tail facilitate the binding of 1a/2a proteins while the bound CP molecules (small blue hexagons) can bridge over with the RdRp complex bound to the subgenomic RNA promoter on (\u2212) strand template. The CP binding might also loosen the original contact of the sgRNA3a/1a\u20132a complex. The 3\u2032 polyA tail and the corresponding internal polyU track are shown on the (+) and (\u2212) strands, respectively. The 1a and 2a proteins of the RdRp complex are represented as shaded ovals. The polyA-polyU hybridization is represented as vertical dotted lines, whereas the red dotted line demonstrates the polymerase-priming events.

The binding of multimeric BMV CPs (represented by blue hexagons) to the PE sites (represented by two stem-loop structures) or to the intergenic Bbox motif sites (represented by single stem-loop structure) brings together both sgRNA3a and RNA3 (+) strand substrates via CP oligomerization. As yet another possibility, CP molecules bind to the stem loop C (SLC) at the 3\u2032 tRNA-like structure of the BMV RNA3 (+) strand and interact in trans with PE or Bbox sites in sgRNA3a, again bringing both molecules to a closer vicinity. The RdRp initiates the (\u2212) strand synthesis at the 3\u2032 end of RNA3, and switches templates onto the sgRNA3a (+) strand at the CP-PE or CP-Bbox road-block bridges.",
