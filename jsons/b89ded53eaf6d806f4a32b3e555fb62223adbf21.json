To investigate the effectiveness of school health 28 services for improving the health of school-age children and adolescents, a systematic review 29 of systematic reviews (overview) was conducted. Five databases were searched through June 30 2018. Systematic reviews of intervention studies that evaluated school-based or school-linked 31 health services delivered by a health provider were included. Review quality was assessed 32 using a modified Ballard and Montgomery four-item checklist. 1654 references were 33 screened and 20 systematic reviews containing 270 primary studies were assessed 34 narratively. Interventions with evidence for effectiveness addressed autism, depression, 35 anxiety, obesity, dental caries, visual acuity, asthma, and sleep. No review evaluated the 36 effectiveness of a multi-component school health services intervention addressing multiple 37 health areas. Strongest evidence supports implementation of anxiety prevention programs, 38 indicated asthma education, and vision screening with provision of free spectacles. 39 Additional systematic reviews are needed that analyze the effectiveness of comprehensive 40 school health services, and specific services for under-researched health areas relevant for 41 this population. 43 The World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Global School Health Initiative 44 in 1995 with the goal to improve child, adolescent and community health through health 45 promotion and programming in schools [1] . This initiative is dedicated to promoting 46 development of school health programs and increasing the number of health-promoting 47 schools, characterized by WHO as \"a school constantly strengthening its capacity as a 3 48 healthy setting for living, learning and working\" [1] . In 2000, WHO, the United Nations 49 Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations Children's 50 Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank developed a partnership for Focusing Resources on 51 Effective School Health -a FRESH Start approach [2] . The FRESH framework promotes 52 four pillars: health-related school policies, provision of safe water and sanitation, skills-based 53 health education and school-based health and nutrition services [2] . While various guidance 54 documents have been published by United Nations (UN) organizations addressing a range of 55 services from oral health to malaria [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , there is no internationally accepted guideline 56 regarding school health services. This systematic review of systematic reviews, henceforth 57 referred to as an overview, will inform the upcoming development of a WHO guideline that 58 addresses one pillar of the FRESH framework: school health services delivered by a health 59 provider. 60 Schools offer a unique platform for health care delivery. In 2015, the global means for 61 the primary and secondary net school enrollment rates were 90% and 65%, respectively, thus 62 the potential reach of school health services is wide [8] . Additionally, a recent review found 63 that school-based or school-linked health services already exist in at least 102 countries [9] . 64 The 2017 Global Accelerated Action for the Health of Adolescents (AA-HA!) 65 implementation guidance calls for the prioritization of school health programs as an 66 important step towards universal health coverage and urges that \"Every school should be a 67 health promoting school\" [10] . 68 The primary objective of this overview was to explore the effectiveness of school-69 based or school-linked health services delivered by a health provider for improving the health 70 of school-age children and adolescents. Through a comprehensive literature search, the 71 overview aimed to identify health areas and specific school health service interventions that 72 have at least some evidence of effectiveness. It was also designed to suggest further research 4 73 in areas where recent systematic reviews (SRs) exist, but with insufficient evidence. Finally, 74 the overview aimed to identify the health areas and specific school health services 75 interventions for which no SRs were found, whether because the primary literature does not 76 exist or where there are primary studies but no SR has been conducted. 77 ",

            "text": "This overview was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic 79 reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) [11] . A protocol was developed a priori that outlined 80 the overview objectives, aims, operational definitions, search strategy, inclusion/exclusion 81 criteria, and quality appraisal methods. This document was followed throughout the review 82 process and is available in S1 Appendix. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] enrolled in schools; (b) interventions were school-based or school-linked health 96 services, involved a health provider (see definitions in S1 Appendix), and were of any 97 duration or length of follow-up; (c) intervention effectiveness was compared to either no 5 98 intervention, an alternative intervention, the same intervention in a different setting (i.e. not 99 in schools), an active control, or a waitlist control; (d) interventions aimed to improve some 100 aspect of health; and (e) study designs were either randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 101 quasi-experimental studies (QEs), or other non-randomized intervention studies. There were 102 no date restrictions on publication of included SRs. In addition to these criteria for included 103 studies, the SRs themselves had to fulfill the following criteria: (a) included the words 104 \"systematic review\" in the title or abstract; (b) outlined inclusion criteria within the methods 105 section; (c) published in peer-reviewed journals and indexed before June 15, 2018; (d) 106 published in the English language. In addition to SRs that did not meet these inclusion 107 criteria, SRs were excluded if the review was superseded by a newer version. 108 Study selection 109 Citations identified from the systematic search were uploaded to Covidence 110 systematic review software [12] and duplicates were automatically deleted. Two reviewers 111 (KK and JL) screened all titles and abstracts using the inclusion/exclusion criteria and 112 excluded all articles that were definitely ineligible. Articles that received conflicting votes 113 (ineligible vs. potentially or probably eligible) were discussed and consensus was reached. 114 The same two reviewers screened the full text of all the potentially or probably eligible 115 articles using a ranked list of the inclusion criteria (S1 Appendix). Reasons for exclusion 116 were selected from the ranked list. If consensus was not possible during title/abstract or full 117 text screening, a third reviewer (DR), who had the casting vote, would have been asked to 118 independently screen the article. This was never required as consensus was always reached. 119 Data collection 120 One reviewer (JL) extracted summary data from each selected article using a 121 customized standard form with independent data extraction performed for 15% of included 122 SRs by one of the other reviewers (DR or KK). There was 92% agreement between reviewers 6 123 for all items within the standard form, with discrepancies only in level of detail . Data items   124   included the research design of the SR and primary studies, sample description and setting,   125   intervention characteristics, outcomes, meta-analysis results, quality appraisal, and   126 conclusions. 128 Due to the heterogeneity of the SRs included in this overview, it was not possible to 129 perform a meta-analysis. Outcome measures were collected from included studies. 131 Risk of bias within primary studies was recorded in S4 Appendix. Risk of bias across 132 SRs was determined using Ballard and Montgomery's four-item checklist for overviews of 133 SRs [13] . These items include: (1) overlap (see below), (2) rating of confidence from the 134 AMSTAR 2 checklist [14] , (3) date of publication, and (4) match between the scope of the 135 included SRs and the overview itself. 136 An important consideration in overviews is the degree of overlap, or the use of the 137 same primary study in multiple included SRs. High overlap can contribute to biased results 138 [15] . This overview used the corrected covered area (CCA), a comprehensive and validated 139 measure, to determine overlap [16] . The CCA is calculated using three variables: the number 140 of \"index\" publications (r), the number of total publications (N), and the number of SRs 141 within the overview (c). An \"index\" publication is the first appearance of a primary study 142 within an overview. The formula for the CCA is:",

One 147 reviewer (JL) assessed all SRs and a second (KK) duplicated appraisal of 10%, with 94% 7 148 agreement and only minor disagreements that did not impact grades of confidence. Following 149 the recommendation of the AMSTAR 2 developers [17] , individual ratings were not 150 combined into an overall score. Instead, the authors determined which of the 16 items on the 151 checklist were critical for this overview and which of the items were non-critical. Building on 152 a method suggested by Shea and colleagues [17] , grades of confidence in the results of each 153 SR were generated based on critical flaws and non-critical weaknesses. The grading system is 154 available in S6 Appendix. Confidence in results ranged from high (three or fewer non-critical 155 weaknesses) to critically low (more than three critical flaws with or without non-critical 156 weaknesses) [17] . used meta-analysis to combine results [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] , whereas the remaining nine SRs narratively 182 synthesized results [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Eleven SRs included studies located in countries with high-183 income or upper-middle income economies only [19, 20, [23] [24] [25] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] 37, 38, 39] . Six SRs 184 included at least one study from countries with lower-middle income or lower income 185 economies [18, 21, 22, 28, 35, 36] . The final three SRs either did not state the locations of 186 included studies [27, 34] or provided regions rather than specific country locations [26] . 187 To be included in this overview, at least 50% of studies within each SR had to fulfill 188 all inclusion criteria. In four SRs, 100% of included studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria 189 [18, 27, 29, 33] , although Brendel and colleagues [29] only included one study in total. In 190 another four SRs, 75% to 99% of included studies fulfilled all the inclusion criteria 191 [21, 26, 30, 37] . In the remaining twelve SRs, 50% to 74% of included studies fulfilled all the 192 inclusion criteria [19, 20, [22] [23] [24] [25] 28, 31, 32, [34] [35] [36] . 193 All SRs primarily examined studies on school-based, rather than school-linked 194 interventions. The 20 SRs covered eight health areas: nine on mental health 195 [19, 23, 24, 28, 29, [32] [33] [34] 36] , four on oral health [18, 25, 27, 30] , two on asthma [31, 37] , and one 196 SR each on sleep [20] ; obesity [26] ; vision [21] ; menstrual management [22] ; and sexual and 197 reproductive health (SRH) [35] . Eleven SRs included only cluster-and individually-9 198 randomized controlled trials [19] [20] [21] 24, 27, 28, 30, 32, 34, 37] , seven SRs included other types of 199 controlled and uncontrolled experimental studies in addition to RCTs [22, 25, 26, 31, 33, 35, 36] , 200 and two SRs included only QEs [29] or controlled clinical trials [23] .

Neil and Christensen analyzed 21 unique anxiety prevention and early intervention programs and found reductions in anxiety symptoms in 78% of the included studies [34] .

WHO reports densities of less than one physician per 1000 population in 76 countries and less than three nurses or Although three SRs mentioned the cost of specialized professionals delivering interventions versus teachers or a school nurse [26, 32, 36] , cost, let alone cost-effectiveness, was not closely analyzed in any of the included SRs.

Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that all four of the SRs given moderate or high levels of confidence were Cochrane reviews. The remaining Cochrane review was given a critically low level of confidence, though this may be because it was published in 2006 and standards for both the methods and reporting of Cochrane reviews have improved in recent years.",

However, it is difficult to formulate an overarching answer about the effectiveness of school health services for improving the health of school-age children and adolescents due to the heterogeneity of SRs found and the evident gaps in the SR literature. More than half of included SRs analyzed mental health and oral health interventions, and no SRs were found that assessed other relevant health areas, such as vaccinations, communicable diseases, injuries, etc. Further, no SRs evaluated comprehensive or multi-component school health services. If school health services are to truly improve the health of children and adolescents, they must comprehensively address the most pressing problems of this population. In order for policy makers and leaders in school health to make evidence-based recommendations on which services should be available in schools, who should deliver them, and how should they be delivered, more SRs must be done. These SRs must assess routine, multi-component school health services and the characteristics that make them effective, with special attention to content, quality, intensity, method of delivery, and cost. The gaps in the SR literature identified by this overview will inform the commissioning of new SRs by WHO to feed into evidence-based global recommendations. ",

Although all SRs were included if at least 50% of the primary studies 161 within them fulfilled all inclusion criteria, SRs where closer to 100% of primary studies 162 fulfilled all criteria were considered to be better matched than those with closer to 50%. 163 RESULTS 164 Results of the search 165 1720 references were identified from the systematic literature search. 570 were 166 duplicates, leaving 1150 titles and abstracts to be screened.

The most 169 common reasons for exclusion were, first, if at least 50% of studies included within a SR 170 were unclear for at least one criterion (e.g. unclear if a health provider was involved), 171 followed by if less than 50% of studies within a SR fulfilled all inclusion criteria. These 172 reasons for exclusion applied to 183 and 126 SRs, respectively.

These SRs 178 contained 270 primary studies, 225 of which were unique and 45 were included in more than 179 one SR. The SRs were written in English and published between 2006 and 2018. Primary 180 studies included within the SRs were published between 1967 and 2017. Eleven of the SRs 181",
