Epidemiology\n1\nis the study of patterns, causes, and effects of disease conditions in defined populations. Viral infections can be classified depending on their epidemiologic features (Table 21.1\n). Epidemic infection (or epidemics\n2\n) is a type of infection in which the infection is extensive and not limited to a certain region but only lasts transiently (Fig. 21.1\n). The seasonal flu is an example of an epidemic infection. In the case of the seasonal flu, although the affected region is extensive, the epidemics in different regions are linked because the same strain of influenza virus is often responsible for a season. Endemic infection is a type of infection in which the infection persists for a longer period of time in a certain region but the infection is typically limited to only a subset of the population. Hepatitis B viral infection in China and in Korea is an example of endemic infection. A subset of the population (~4\u20138%) is chronically infected. Sporadic infection is a type of infection in which the infection is limited to the affected persons and regions. It lasts transiently. In this case, there are no links between outbreaks\n3\noccurring in different regions. Pandemics refer to epidemics occurring across multiple continents.",

Fortunately, Ebola outbreaks have been mainly restricted to Africa. The potential for Ebola to become a widespread epidemic is low due to the high case-fatality rate and the rapid demise of patients. The Ebola virus came up in the Hollywood movie, \u201cOutbreak,\u201d starring Dustin Hoffman. While a monkey served as the reservoir of the virus in the movie, in reality, bats are the reservoir (Fig. 21.4\n). Bats and primates are sold in markets and consumed as bush meat in some areas of Africa. In a viral perspective, the host change from bats to humans is a bit challenging as it imposes a selective pressure for mutations. It is thought a variant highly virulent in humans is generated during the adaptation of the virus in a new host. The Ebola virus is a good example of a new emerging virus which originates from the rainforest in Africa.",

Clinical resemblance to hantavirus infection, which occurred during the Korean war (1950\u201353), led investigators to look for the culprit in rodents. Until then no known cases of hantavirus infection had ever been reported in the United States. The culprit was a deer mouse discovered near the home of one of the initial patients. Not surprisingly, newly discovered Sin Nombre virus (SNV) is related to the hantavirus. Hantavirus was discovered by Ho-Wang Lee in Korea in 1776 as the etiological agent responsible for the Korean hemorrhagic fever outbreak which occurred among American and Korean soldiers during the Korean War. Patients with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) had mild flu-like symptoms such as malaise, headache, cough, fever, with a sudden onset of pulmonary edema, and finally death. In this epidemic, 24 cases were reported with a 50% mortality rate. SNV8\nbelongs to the Hantavirus genus of family Bunyaviridae (see Table 16.4). SNV infection occurs wherever its reservoir rodent carrier (the deer mouse) is found. This includes the entire populated area of North America except for the far southeastern region. SNV can be contracted through the inhalation of virus-contaminated deer mouse excretion. The fatality rate of SNV-induced HPS in the United States was reported to be about 66.7%. However, since that time the fatality rate has steadily declined as more mild cases have come to be recognized.",

Symptoms of infection from the Malaysian outbreak were primarily encephalitic in humans and respiratory in pigs. Respiratory illness in humans has been seen in later outbreaks, increasing the likelihood of human-to-human transmission and indicating the existence of more dangerous strains of the virus. Based on seroprevalence data and the data from viral isolations, the primary reservoir for Nipah virus was identified as Pteropid fruit bats. The transmission of Nipah virus from bats to pigs is thought to be due to an increasing overlap between bat habitats and piggeries in peninsular Malaysia.",

            "text": "Why are new human pathogenic viruses continually emerging? In most cases, outbreaks have been known to occur in tropical regions in which there were no human inhabitants. An increase in contact with wild animals, due to the expansion of the human habitat, is believed to be the main cause for the emergence of new viruses. Changes in the environment such as rainforest developments have led to an increase in contact between wild animals and humans. As a result, viruses which only existed in rainforests are able to be transmitted to a new human host. Climate changes such as global warming are another cause for the emergence of new viruses. This is demonstrated by the WNV outbreaks in the Northern Hemisphere. Many of these newly emerging viruses are zoonotic viruses. In particular, bats serve as reservoirs to many newly emerging viruses. Bats are natural reservoirs for the Ebola virus, SARS-CoV, and the Nipah virus. What makes bats so special? Bats are unique because they are mammals that can fly. As mammals, they are a closer relation to humans than to birds. In addition, it is speculated that the immunity of bats is conspicuously tolerable to viruses. Many types of viruses found in bats (ie, virome\n10\n) are currently being analyzed with the implementation of next generation sequencing technology. The bat virome is expected to provide insight on newly emerging viruses that have yet been discovered.",

The number of cases detected after April 2013 fell abruptly. The decrease in the number of new human H7N9 cases may have resulted from the containment measures taken by Chinese authorities (closing live bird markets), a change in seasons, or possibly a combination of both factors.",

Although an effective measles vaccine is available, a controversy regarding the popular MMR vaccine\n11\nformulation in the late 1990s led to a reduction of vaccinations in some countries. This disrupted efforts toward the eradication of measles. After the MMR vaccine controversy began, MMR vaccination compliance dropped sharply in the United Kingdom from 92% in 1996 to 84% in 2002 (Fig. 21.15\n). After the vaccination rates dropped the incidence of two out of the three diseases increased greatly in the United Kingdom. In 2008, for the first time in 14 years, measles was declared endemic in the United Kingdom. The disease was sustained within the population. This was caused by the preceding decade\u2019s low MMR vaccination rates which created a population of susceptible children able to spread the disease.",

Despite extraordinary advances in the development of countermeasures (diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines), the ease of world travel and an increase in global interdependence has added layers of complexity to containing these infectious diseases which could affect not only the health but the economic stability of societies. Surveillance such as quarantine at the airport and seaport locations has become critically important. In particular, during an epidemic, special attention should be paid to contain airborne viruses such as the influenza virus and SARS-CoV. These viruses can spread rapidly to other continents via air travel. Countermeasures to control these emerging viruses should be made available in preparation for future pandemics. Recent Zika virus\n12\noutbreak started in May 2015 in Brazil reminded us the importance of mosquito-borne flaviviruses (see Box 12.1).",
