Until February 23 rd 2020, more than 77 000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed in China, which has a great impact on economy and society. It has also interferred with ordinary medical practice of oral and maxillofacial surgery seriously. In order to protect the oral and maxillofacial surgery medical staff from 2019-nCoV infection during the outbreak period, this paper suggests the necessary medical protective measures for oral and maxillofacial surgery outpatients and wards.",

Oral and maxillofacial surgeons are prone to contact patients in close proximity, which is very likely to cause occupational exposure and cross infection. At the same time, compared with the 2019-nCoV infection prevention and control first-line departments, department of oral and maxillofacial surgery may have potential problems such as insufficient awareness, insufficient protection measures, and irregular protection procedures. Although our hospital's oral and maxillofacial surgery currently focuses on emergency work, but there has been no 2019-nCov infection caused by work reasons among the medical staff of oral and maxillofacial surgery during the outbreak, so we would like to share the strategies, measures and experience of prevention of infection among the medical staff of oral and maxillofacial surgery.",

The virus is heat sensitive and can be inactivated when exposed to ultraviolet or at 56 \u2022 C for 30 minutes. At the same time, the use of ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, peracetic acid and chloroform and other fat solvents can effectively inactivate the virus, but chlorhexidine can not effectively inactivate the virus. 1 2019-nCoV is considered to be generally susceptible to people, with the ability of human to human transmission, including: respiratory droplets transmission and contact, fecal oral transmission or direct contact with secretion with virus. 5 The incubation period of 2019-nCoV infection is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days. 1 The condition of the elderly and those with basic diseases is more serious after infection, and children and infants also have diseases, but the symptoms are relatively light. 5 Common symptoms after 2019-nCoV infection are fever, dry cough, muscle ache or fatigue. 6 However, some patients only showed low fever, slight asthenia, even no fever, pneumonia and other clinical manifestations. 5",
