At the time of writing this paper, the world suffers from an outbreak of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. A promising way to stop the virus replication is via protease inhibition. We propose an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm (EMOA) to design potential protease inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2's main protease. Based on the SELFIES representation the EMOA maximizes the binding of candidate ligands to the protein using the docking tool QuickVina 2, while at the same time taking into account further objectives like drug-likeliness or the fulfillment of filter constraints. The experimental part analyzes the evolutionary process and discusses the inhibitor candidates.",

One strategy to limit virus replication is protease inhibition. A biomolecule called ligand binds to a virus protease enzyme and inhibits its functional properties. For SARS-CoV-2 the crystal structure of its main protease M pro has been solved, e.g. by Jin et al. [17] . The search for a valid protease inhibitor can be expressed as optimization problem. As not only the binding of the ligand is an important objective, but also further properties like drug-likeliness or filter properties, we comprise the molecule search problem as multi-objective optimization problem, which we aim to solve with evolutionary algorithms. This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we shortly repeat the basics of protease inhibition and the connection to the novel coronavirus. Section 3 gives an overview of related work on evolutionary molecule design.In Section 4 we introduce molecule metrics, which we aim to optimize with the EMOA that is presented in Section 5. The experimental part in Section 6 presents our experimental results and discusses the evolved molecules. Conclusions are drawn in Section 7, where also prospective future research directions are presented.",

As RNA virus SARS-CoV-2's replication mechanism hijacks the cell mechanisms for replication. An essential part of the virus replication process is a cleavage process, in which the virus protease enzyme cuts long precursor polyproteins into mature non-structural proteins, see Fig. 1 . If a ligand biomolecule binds to the protease it can prevent and inhibit this cleavage process. A ligand binds to the target protein in a so-called pocket based on various non-covalent interactions like hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, \u03c0-stacking, salt bridges, and amide stacking [15] . With the proper ligand, the protease cleavage process is inhibited, in practice measured by the half maximal inhibitory concentration IC 50 corresponding to the inhibitory substance quantity needed to inhibit 50% of the protease process. The protease inhibitor is the target of the drug design process, which we aim to find with evolutionary search.",

A solution is defined by a string based on the self-referencing embedded strings (SELFIES) representation [21] , which is an advancement of the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILIES) [34] representation. Figure 2 pictures an exemplary molecule with its structural formula and the corresponding SMILIES and SELFIES representations. Each string consist of symbols, encoding the occurring atoms, bindings, branches and ring sizes. SELFIES implements a formal grammar, and the interpretation of a symbol depends on derivation rules and state of derivation. In contrast to SMILIES, SELFIES strings are always syntactically correct and therefore always yield valid molecules [21] . The EA's initial population consists of individuals with randomly generated strings representation of a fixed length. Since multiple SELFIES strings can be translated to the same SMILIES string, the resulting SMILIES string is compared to a global list of all previously generated individuals. Individuals with a representation that already occurred are discarded and a new individual is generated. This process is repeated until the population consist of unique individuals and also applies for the generation of offspring individuals.",

            "text": "In this section we experimentally analyze the single-objective and the NSGA-II approaches for the protease inhibitor candidate search. For the experimental analyses, the following settings are applied. A (10 + 100)-EA is used for the singleobjective run i.e., in each generation from 10 parents 100 offspring candidate molecules are generated with the mutation operators introduced in Section 5.1 with mutation probabilities p r = 0.05, p i = 0.1, and p d = 0.1 applying plus selection. For multi-objective runs the number of parents is increased to 20 to achieve a broader distribution of solutions in objective space. No crossover is applied. Individuals are limited to a length of 80 SELFIES tokens oriented to the setting by Krenn et al. [21] . All runs are terminated after 200 generations and are repeated 20 times. Figure 3 shows the development of the previously explained normalized metrics in single-and multi-objective runs. For the single-objective runs, the best individuals according to fitness are chosen in each generation and their metrics are averaged over all runs. The optimization process concentrates on improving docking score, QED, and NP. As expected, an improvement of one metric may result in a deterioration of another, e.g., as of generation 140, when QED and NP deteriorate in favor of SA and docking score. For multi-objective runs, the best individuals for each metric are chosen in each generation and then averaged over all runs. A steady improvement with regard to all objectives is achieved here, but has to be paid with regard to deteriorations in other objectives that are not shown here. Figure 4 shows three different two-dimensional slices of the Pareto front that compare docking score to QED, NP, and SA. A Pareto front is shown for every 10th generation and their colors start at light blue for the first generation and end at dark blue for the final generation. The plots illustrate NSGA-II's ability to generate solutions with different degrees of balance between docking score and the plotted metric.",

For NSGA-II the best achieved values for each objective are shown corresponding to the corner points of the Pareto front approximation. For comparison, corresponding metric values are shown for N3 proposed as ligand in the PDB database as well as for Lopinavir, the HIV main protease inhibitor [18] . Docking scores achieved by the single objective optimization process show that the best values even overcome the scores of N3 and Lopinavir. Lopinavir and N3 bind similarly strong to M pro . NSGA-II achieves promising values for all metrics. The broad coverage of objective function values offers the practitioner a huge variety of interesting candidates. However, some of Table 2 : Experimental results of weighted-sum single-objective approach, the best values per objective for NSGA-II, the N3 ligand (from PDB 6LU7), and Lopinavir (a prominent drug candidate). Statistical evaluation for the NSGA-II method is calculated based on the best 20 individuals per objective. marks a minimization objective, while marks a maximization objective. From our observations we conclude that the SELFIES representation with our mutation operators are able to robustly achieve molecules of a certain quality. However, we expect the quality of the results to improve with mechanisms that allow the development of larger molecules to overcome fitness plateaus and local optima. Figure 5 compares the populations of the last generation of a typical single-objective and NSGA-II run. The solutions in the single-objective population are similar to each other, while the solutions in the last NSGA-II population maintain a higher diversity of molecule properties. ",

The molecules generated have a strong tendency to contain aromatic ring structures. Candidates with good drug-likeliness are comparatively short. Candidates with high docking scores often have unrealistic geometries. In Figure 6 we present a list of six promising protease inhibitors (PI) candidates with properties as radar plots, structural formulas, and chemical names. PI-I (a) to PI-III (c) are results from single-objective runs, while PI-IV (c) to PI-VI (f) show candidates generated by NSGA-II. Points near the border of the radar plot represent better values, e.g., a zero value lies at the corner of a plot. All candidates fulfill the filter condition. PI-1 achieves a high SA value with a reasonable docking score. PI-II achieves an excellent docking score with \u22129.7 kcal/mol. PI-III, PI-IV, and PI-VI achieve excellent drug-likeliness QED with good docking results around \u22127.0 kcal/mol. An interesting candidate balancing all objectives is PI-V with docking score \u22127.7 kcal/mol and QED value of 0.75.",

In the experimental part we have shown that the evolutionary processes are able to evolve interesting inhibitor candidates. Many of them achieve promising metrics with ordinary structures, but also unconventional candidates have been evolved that may be worth for a deeper analysis. As the informative value of QuickVina 2 binding scores and also the further metrics may be limited in practice, we understand our approach as AI-assisted virtual screening of the chemical biomolecule space. Future research will focus on the improvement of protein-ligand models for more detailed and more efficient binding affinity models. Further, we see potential to improve the SELFIES representation in terms of bloated strings that represent comparatively small molecules and mechanisms to guarantee their validity.",
