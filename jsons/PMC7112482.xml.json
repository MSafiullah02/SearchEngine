The system\ncan be modeled as a static network basing on this assumption, which is effective in many\ncircumstances, such as the spread of the computer viruses, traffic dynamics, and the\npropagation of some diseases which spread rapidly. However, the propagation of many\ninfectious diseases has comparable time scale as fluctuation of the networks topology, such\nas tuberculosis, foot and mouth disease among cattle, and various sexually transmitted\ninfections.6\u20139",

However, if the mobility rate is enough high, the epidemic can spread into the second\ncommunity before it die, and the epidemic can also survive in the first community because\nof the infected individuals jumping from the second community to the first community. For\nchecking this idea, let us perform experiments. We structure the time-varying networks\nwith the same parameters as used in Fig. 2, but\n\u03bb=0.005,\nwhich is larger than \u03bbc2=0.0018\nand is smaller than \u03bbc1=0.0061.\nAnd we set the initial number of infected individuals x(0)=100,\nwhich is randomly chosen in the first community.
