These induce one equivalence class of the 6 edges and so a ball-like neighbourhood for any point of an edge, and so for any point of the identified simplexS. If we vary the face angles \u03b1 1 , \u03b1 2 , \u03b1 3 at the opposite edges ofS, then it will be no more a manifold, but for special angles there exists a natural parameter 1 < k \u2208 N, such thatS(k) seems to represent a compact hyperbolic orbifold with a closed singularity geodesics of rotation order k. We shall use the Poincar\u00e9 half space model of H 3 , with the complex projective line C \u221e for the absolute and with (w, \u03b6), |z 1 \u2212 w||w \u2212 z 2 | = \u03b6 \u00b7 \u03b6 for an interior point of H 3 , ower w \u2208 C \u221e and third coordinate \u03b6 on the half circle z 1 z 2 (see Fig. 1 .b and Fig. 5-6) . Moreover, We compute the volume V(k) of S(k) as well by means of the Lobachevski function \u039b(x) in (2.12). It maybe surprising that V(k) \u2192 0 if k \u2192 \u221e in the conflict mentioned in the abstract. Our result implies similar consequence for the double orientable cover of the Gieseking manifold, i.e. for the figure-eight-knot manifold examined also by Thurston [13] . This paper is refreshing [9] as byproduct of [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . A. D. Mednykh and V. S. Petrov [5] cited our [9, 10] and noticed our deeper mistake, as it will be improved here.
