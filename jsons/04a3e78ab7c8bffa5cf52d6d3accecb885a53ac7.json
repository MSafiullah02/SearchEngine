Along with socioeconomic development, climate change has exacerbated the conflict between water supply and demand in the northern arid regions of China and exacerbated water depletion (due to water quality) of the southern humid regions. Over the last decade, the river discharge in the northwest alpine mountain areas has significantly increased, mainly due to accelerated glacier melting. Because extreme precipitation events have increased, the frequency and volumes of floods have increased, and the scope and intensity of drought have also increased. And sea-level rise has posed serious challenges to flood control in coastal areas.",

River segments with water quality worse than the V standard accounted for 21 % of the total river segments, an increase of 4 % compared with 2001. The rapid development of regional industrial and agricultural activities contributed to the deterioration of water quality, but climate change also had an effect on hydrology. Higher air temperatures effected the biological environment of rivers and lakes, and the distribution of water organisms, particularly in water bodies prone to cyanobacteria or eutrophication. On the other hand, reduced precipitation and reduced discharge due to industrial and agricultural development decreased the ability of rivers to dilute toxins. As a result, water-quality problems have led to more prominent water shortages in the southern, humid regions of China. Zhang et al. 2007; Su et al. 2007; Ding et al. 2007) ",

The recent increased glacial runoff into the Yangtze River partly compensated for the decrease in the river's discharge. Intensification of glacier ablation and shrinkage has led to the areal expansion of some lakes that are mainly supplied by glacial runoff. In recent years, the frequency of glacier floods and glacial lake outburst floods has increased.

Another prominent phenomenon in Chinese coastal waters is the salinity of the Bohai Sea. The average salinity of the entire Bohai Sea has increased nearly 2 Psu (salinity unit) from 1961 to 1996. The salinity near the old estuary of the Yellow River in Bohai Bay has increased nearly 10 Psu, mainly caused by the reduction of Yellow River discharge to the Bohai Sea, and increased evaporation (Wu et al. 2004) . The evaporation of the East China Sea has significantly increased, by *1.2 cm/year, which has led to continuing loss of freshwater and heat, while the freshwater flux of the South China Sea has weakened, leading to decreased endothermic conditions from 1979 to 2008.",

Sea-level rise leads to aggravated coastal erosion, which has increased significantly since the 1950s. The majority of sandy shores, muddy shores, and coral reefs changed from deposition or stable states to erosional states, and total erosion increased. The average coastal erosion rate is 15-20 m/a from 1976 to 1982 in Hainan Island. Sea-level rise has increased coastal water depths, enhanced wave action, and intensified storm surges. Rising sea level has led to estuarine saltwater wedges upstream, increasing the intensity of seawater intrusion into rivers and aggravating groundwater salinization. This phenomenon is particularly evident near the deltas of major Chinese rivers. Seawater intrusion is more pronounced in coastal cities close to the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea. Laizhou Bay, in Shandong Province, is one of the regions with the most serious seawater intrusion in China. The rate of intrusion has increased from 46 m/year during 1976-1979 to 404.5 m/year during 1987-1988 in this region. The sea-level rise has significant effects on salinity traced in Pearl River Delta. The traced distance of 250 mg/L of salinity line significantly increased with the upstream runoff frequency increases. The boundary of salinity traced back to the upstream significantly moved under certain upstream runoff conditions and the rise in sea level (Kong et al. 2010 ).",

Reducing the number of sunshine hours and precipitation will decrease the potential production, while temperature will increase the potential production. If the light and temperature conditions are suitable, the coordination between soil moisture and light and temperature conditions will help to achieve higher crop yields. On the contrary, the crop will slowly grow, and crop potential production will decline if the crop cannot get sufficient water supply. Decreasing precipitation at this century is the major factor of Chinese crop potential production. Climate warming is caused by the increase of atmospheric CO 2 and other greenhouse gas concentrations. As a substrate for photosynthesis, atmospheric CO 2 enrichment will lead to enhanced crop photosynthesis, which will help improve crop yields. However, the carbon content in the plant increases, the nitrogen content is relatively lower, the protein may reduce, and crop quality may decline. The CO 2 fertilization effect is a concrete manifestation of the crop growth environment and species breed to manage conditions. Currently, research is still not completely understood by the mechanism and extent of the stimulation of CO 2 on crop, and the research work in this area needs to be further strengthened.",

The impacts of climate change on animal husbandry are complex. Rising air temperatures and sustained or decreasing precipitation result in an increase in evapotranspiration of grasslands. High winds, dust storms, drought, and other extreme climate even negatively affect the growth of grass and result in a decline of pasture. More droughts strengthen the potential desertification of semiarid areas increased droughts in steppe regions, and longer droughts, which further reduce soil fertility, reduce the yield of grasslands, decrease the pasture cover, decrease the yield of forage, and decrease the grassland carrying capacity and stocking rates. On the other hand, climate warming, especially an increase in the average cold-season air temperature, favors the overwintering and reproduction of rats and other pests, leading to plant reduction and an increase in livestock epidemics. The impacts of climate change on livestock breeding both good and bad, but mainly, are adverse. Rising winter and spring temperatures and a reduction of snow-covered areas have reduced the snowstorm hazard in pastoral areas and benefited to livestock survival in winter and spring.

Climate change can affect the structure, composition, function, and productivity of forest ecosystems (especially high-latitude cold-temperature forests) and can threaten the recovery of degraded forest ecosystems.

The start of spring has advanced in northeastern China, northern China, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, but it has been postponed in eastern southwest China, in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and in other areas. The extent of these changes across latitudes has decreased. Measurements suggest that the spatial distribution of some types of forests has changed in response to climate change, and the tree-line elevation has risen in some areas. Climate change has negatively impacted the secondary succession in some forests, and the recovery of tropical forest ecosystems, with an increase in the mortality of trees in secondary forest successions. The intensity and frequency of droughts have caused increased forest fuel accumulation, with prolonged periods of fire danger (now beginning in the early spring),resulting more early spring and summer fire-prone forest fires, and expanded geographic distribution area of forest fires, and then intensified frequency and intensity of forest fires.

The probability of occurrence of drought in dry season and floods in humid season has increased, and the hydrological regime changed. Meanwhile, the annual runoff and hydrological process of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have significantly changed under the rapid growth of water consumption with the economic development, water conservancy and hydropower project construction, inter-basin water transfer, and other factors. Under future climate change scenarios, the Three Gorges reservoir area is projected to significant warming and wet, and the frequency of flood, droughts, and other extreme events of the upstream region is projected to increase. The probability of occurrence of mudslides, landslides, and other geological disasters in the Three Gorges reservoir areas may increase with the increase of heavy precipitation, which will have adverse effects on the Three Gorges Project management, dam safety, flood control, flood fighting, etc. The increasing drought in the dry season will affect the water deposition, power generation, shipping, and water environment of Three Gorges Project. Thus, the early preventive measures are very important to adapt to climate change impacts. These measures include the following: by strengthening the joint scheduling with tributaries and reservoirs in upper and middle reach, flood diversion areas in middle and downstream reach and then reducing the risk of flood and insufficient power in the dry season; implementation of watershed eco-environment management and developing a long-term plan, strengthening infrastructure construction of flood control, drought, water supply, etc.; strengthening the monitoring efforts of geological and seismic disaster; increase in reservoir sewage treatments.",

Climate change, in particular, changes in precipitation, which probably has adverse effects on water resource and ecological environment of reservoirs of the middle route of WTSN. The middle route of WTSN probably encounters frequency of flood and drought conflict between the river networks in south and north China. Climate change may lead to the risk of water shortage in the source of WTSN, no water consume demand, water pollution, floods, earthquakes and other geological disasters. At the same time, climate change will not ease the water shortage situation in north China, while the receiving water in north China will add more soil moisture, which may lead to higher significant temperature, more latent heat and evaporation changes that may cause a certain degree of local climate change. Therefore, we need to take engineering measures and non-engineering measures to circumvent the possible project risks, hydrological risk, ecology and environmental risks, economic risks, social risks, etc. The basic starting point should be help to improve and restore the surface, ground, and coastal water environment and its associated ecosystems, while solving the short-term urgent needs of water shortages in yellow River, Huai River, and Hai River Basin.
