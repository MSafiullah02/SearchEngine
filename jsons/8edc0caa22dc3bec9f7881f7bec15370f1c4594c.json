At present, limited specific data are available on the clinical characteristics and natural course of critically ill patients with COVID-19 [13, 14] . In a study of 138 patients with 2019 nCoV, 36/138 were admitted to the ICU and they were significantly older than patients who did not require ICU admission (median of 66 compared to 51 years) and were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (72% compared to 37%). In the ICU, 11% of patients received high-flow nasal cannula and 15 (44%) received noninvasive ventilation. Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 17 patients (47%), 4 of whom received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as rescue therapy [15] . Interestingly, 44% were reported to develop arrhythmias in the ICU. In another study of 52 critically ill adult patients, the mean age was 60 years, with 40% of patients had at least one chronic illness. Of these patients, 67% developed ARDS, 29% acute kidney injury, 23% cardiac injury and 29% liver dysfunction. Invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation was required in 71% of patients. By day 28, 62% of patients died [16] . The majority of the severely ill cases have been in adults, with very limited data on pediatric infections with severe illness thus far.",

During MERS and SARS outbreaks, delayed or even missed diagnoses have led to exposing many other patients, visitors and healthcare workers to the infection. Additionally, the currently available testing has not been formally validated for sensitivity and until more data are available negative PCR needs to be interpreted in clinical context and with caution [17, 18] .",

With concerns that the virus remains viable in inanimate environments for a sustained period, special attention needs to be paid to environmental disinfection in the ICU [12, 22] .

At the time of writing this paper, there are > 160 registered randomized and nonrandomized studies (http://www.chict r.org.cn/searc hproj en.aspx and http://apps.who.int/trial searc h/defau lt.aspx) for treatment of COVID-19 using a variety of interventions including corticosteroids, different combinations of ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, interferons and other agents. An RCT is being conducted using remdesivir for severe COVID-19 (NCT04257656). Many lessons have been learned from previous outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, as the research response has often been insufficient to answer questions relevant to optimal clinical practice due to the long lead times that are necessary to design, implement, obtain approval, and recruit patients into randomized controlled trials [24] . For COVID-19, the World Health Organization in collaboration with the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GLOPID-R) has organized the Global Research and Innovation Forum in February 11-12, 2020 to identify the urgent priorities for research in aspects related to the outbreak including clinical characterization, therapeutics and diagnostics, among other priorities. The REMAP-CAP (Randomized, Embedded, Multifactorial Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia) is designed as an adaptive pre-planned, pre-approved platform trial for ICU patients with severe communityacquired pneumonia. The trial is recruiting currently at 52 sites in 13 countries on 3 continents with a further 35-40 sites being activated (https ://www.remap cap.org) [25] . The trial is multifactorial, meaning it can analyze the independent effect of multiple interventions and their interactions and utilizes frequent analyses using Bayesian statistics to report results as soon as there is sufficient statistical confidence regarding superiority, inferiority or equivalence of interventions that are being evaluated [25] . Urgent modifications are being made to the protocol of REMAP-CAP to make it suitable to evaluate the effect of a range of interventions that may be active against this COVID-19. If COVID-19 becomes widespread, there are plans to substantially increase the number of sites that can participate in REMAP-CAP.",
