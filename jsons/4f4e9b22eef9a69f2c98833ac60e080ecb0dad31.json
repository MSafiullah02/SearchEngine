Among the diagnostic PI evaluations, PCR for virus detection in collected sputum was the most commonly conducted test (45 episodes; 91.8%). Blood culture and the serum Aspergillus antigen test were the next most commonly used tests (44 episodes; 89.8%, 41 episodes; 83.7%). Chest CT was performed when PI was first suspected in 40 episodes (81.6%; IQR, 0-2). As the non-invasive tests, CMV antigenemia or viral load and mycoplasma antibody were commonly checked in 34 episodes (69.4%) and 36 episodes (73.5%). However, sputum examination for bacteria and Pneumocystis jiroveci were only conducted in 20 episodes (40.8%), and 16 episodes (32.7%). BAL was performed in 9 episodes at a median time of 2.0 days (IQR, 1.0-8.0) after a PI was visible. LB was conducted in 5 episodes at a median time of 7.0 days (IQR, 3.5-8.5). Additionally, 3 episodes were evaluated by both BAL and LB. After invasive tests, prolonged air leakage developed in one patient who had undergone VATS biopsy.

Similar to previous studies, we reported a relationship between organ dysfunction and mortality; however, the present study focused on recipients with PIs and the early predictors of mortality, rather than all recipients of HSCT and already critically ill patients. After organ dysfunctions worsen, patients could transfer to the PICU for extracorporeal organ support. Among recipients with PIs, 21 episodes required PICU admission and only 30% survived.Interestingly, there was no difference in days from the diagnosis to PICU admission for those who survived and those who did not. We may assume that simple organ supportive care with early transfer to the PICU is not enough to inhibit the progression from MODS to mortality.
