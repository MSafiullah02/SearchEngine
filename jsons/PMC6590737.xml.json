To determine the association between the presence of Salmonella I 4,[5],12:i:- and lesions consistent with enteric salmonellosis, we also reviewed 40 additional cases that met the previously stated inclusion criteria but from which neither Salmonella I 4,[5],12:i:- nor Salmonella Typhimurium were isolated; we randomly selected these cases from an Excel (Microsoft, https://www.microsoft.com) data file by using the RAND() function.",

In this study, we demonstrate a strong positive association between histologic lesions consistent with enteric salmonellosis and isolation of Salmonella I 4,[5],12:i:-. In most cases from which Salmonella I 4,[5],12:i:- or Salmonella Typhimurium were isolated, the severity of histologic lesions was similar. However, the percentage of cases in which histologic lesions consistent with enteric salmonellosis were present was lower for cases from which Salmonella I 4,[5],12:i:- (72%) was isolated than for cases from which Salmonella Typhimurium (94%) was isolated. Based on these data, we believe that Salmonella I 4,[5],12:i:- is a likely cause of enteric salmonellosis that has a similar or perhaps slightly lower pathogenic potential in swine than Salmonella Typhimurium. Pathogenicity studies are needed to further characterize the pathogenic potential and fitness of Salmonella I 4,[5],12:i:- compared with that of Salmonella Typhimurium in swine.",
