            "text": "Live plant and animal imports provide economic benefits but also pose serious biological invasion and disease risks (Karesh et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2009). Species that escape and become invasive disrupt economic and ecological systems, reduce agricultural productivity, lower biodiversity and/or act as vectors for diseases of humans and wildlife (Pimentel et al., 2005). Over recent decades, the size of the international trade in non\u2010native species has increased rapidly, leading to greater numbers of recorded invasions (Dehnen\u2010Schmutz et al. 2007, Keller and Drake, 2009). Some notable examples are the Burmese python, which is linked to severe declines in native mammal populations in Florida (Dorcas et al., 2012) and water hyacinth, a plant that has disrupted recreation, navigation and aquatic ecosystems across many regions (Adebayo et al., 2011). Additionally, the import of live animals, for example through the pet trade, has contributed to the spread of a host of diseases affecting humans, livestock, and native plants and animals. For example, monkeypox was introduced to the United States in 2003 in imported African rodents and caused 72 human cases (Reed et al., 2004). Trade in wildlife has also been implicated in the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) (Van Borm et al., 2005) and amphibian chytridiomycosis (Schloegel et al., 2010, 2012; Fisher et al., 2012), the latter of which has caused extirpation and extinction of some native amphibians.",

These tools allow the majority of benign species, which are beneficial to trade, to be imported, and allow agencies to ban the import of species predicted to be invasive (Keller & Drake, 2009). While the threat of pathogen spread by live animal importation is widely acknowledged, only limited attempts have been made to formalize and integrate this concern quantitatively in risk assessment tools. Instead, tools focus almost exclusively on either the probability that a species will become established and/or invasive, or on pathogen transmission risk from importing livestock (Murray et al., 2004; Bomford, 2008).",

            "text": "In this study, we develop a rapid risk assessment tool for estimating the likelihood that a bird species in trade will cause negative environmental and health impacts if imported to the United States. Birds are well studied ecologically and taxonomically, and abundant data are available to investigate the factors that make them likely to establish (or not), become invasive and transmit diseases. Thousands of non\u2010native bird species have been transported and introduced across the globe by humans (Bomford et al., 2003; Blackburn et al., 2009a). At least 2760 release events are known, of which 1292 have led to established populations (Sol et al., 2012). These established populations cause negative impacts including reduced agricultural yields, loss of native biodiversity and damage to infrastructure (Pimentel et al., 2005; Brochier et al., 2010; Kumschick & Nentwig, 2010; Newson et al., 2011; Kumschick et al., 2013). In addition, non\u2010native birds are reservoirs of introduced zoonotic pathogens (e.g. West Nile virus (WNV) and avian influenza virus), as well as pathogens that threaten livestock (e.g. Newcastle disease virus) and wildlife (e.g. WNV, Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Trichomonas gallinae) (Fischer et al., 1997; Falcon, 2004; Hosseini et al., 2006; Kilpatrick et al., 2006; LaDeau et al., 2007; Boyce et al., 2009; Kilpatrick, 2011; Lawson et al., 2012). The potential for future invasions and disease spread by birds is large, as international trade continues to grow (Smith et al., 2008, 2009) and birds are reservoirs for just over 10% (82/800) of all known zoonoses (Cleaveland et al., 2001).",

At a national level, some countries (e.g. Australia, New Zealand) routinely conduct risk assessment for newly imported species, and the European Union has imposed a total ban on imported wild birds to protect against introduction of avian influenza (Van den Berg, 2009). The United States does not routinely assess imported bird species for invasion risk, but the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA\u2010APHIS) has banned the import of all birds from the 46 countries in which highly pathogenic avian influenza is considered to be present (USDA\u2010APHIS 2013).",

To the best of our knowledge, only the Bomford (2008) model has been implemented in a national biosecurity programme. Each of the models listed above focus on the risk of bird establishment and invasion, but none incorporate the risks of new diseases, nor do they integrate risk assessment with an economic decision model. We are not aware of an avian risk assessment model that has previously been developed specifically for the United States, one of the largest players in global bird trade.",

All established non\u2010native bird species in the United States incur some costs from population monitoring, and all established species present a risk of vectoring diseases. A subset of these also cause economic and/or ecological impacts by, for example, reducing crop yields, competing with native species, or vectoring diseases. In our two\u2010step risk assessment approach, we first assess establishment probability by constructing a model based on historical observations of the outcomes from bird introductions to the United States. Economic criteria are then used to establish a threshold for determining whether a given species poses an establishment risk greater than its projected benefits and should thus be barred from trade. Second, we construct a model of emerging infectious disease threat based on economic and ecological characteristics of the exporting country. This step effectively extends the current USDA\u2010APHIS program for avian influenza to include a wider range of disease risks. We illustrate how the establishment and disease models can be combined to identify high\u2010priority species for exclusion and/or extended risk assessment.",

These data were updated to current taxonomy following Clements et al. (2012) and used to analyze patterns of avian importation and parameterize the models below. These records indicate that over 2.6 million individuals from 947 species were imported. To assess the rate of establishment of previously imported birds, we obtained similar data from USFWS for imports from 1968 to 1972 (Romagosa, In press).

We examine a set of alternative ratios of V\nT to \u03c0V\nE, where the latter term reflects the expected damage of a species before the true status of the species is known. This ratio is given by the proportion \u03b1=VT\u03c0VE. This approach enables easy illustration of various cases in relation to a benchmark scenario where \u03b1BM = 1. Under the benchmark case, V\nT = \u03c0V\nE; the expected costs and benefits of importing a proposed species are equal. Under this scenario, a decision\u2010maker would be indifferent between banning all imports and accepting all imports (in the absence of an informed screening system).

This early subset was selected to minimize downward bias in the estimate that could be driven by either a lag in establishment or a delay in recording establishment.

Established species are those that developed self\u2010sustaining populations that persisted for at least 20 years.
