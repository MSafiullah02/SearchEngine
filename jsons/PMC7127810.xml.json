The ongoing occurrence of emergent infections provoked a resolution calling for the revision of the IHR (1969) at the 1995 World Health Assembly. In 2001, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution on global health security epidemic alert and response in which WHO was to support its member states in identifying, verifying, and responding to public health emergencies of international concern. In 2002, the World Health Assembly reiterated the need to revise the IHR to reflect the changes in its resolution, global public health response to natural occurrences, and accidental release or deliberate use of biologic, chemical, or nuclear agents that affect health. The outbreak of SARS, however, prompted the World Health Assembly, in 2003, to decide on establishing the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Revision of the IHR to accelerate the process.",

Thus, regional surveillance networks, such as MBDS and MECIDS, can facilitate the IHR and play an important role in their implementation. For example, in 2007, MECIDS members convened a workshop on implementing the IHR in the event of an influenza pandemic. This event was held in cooperation with WHO headquarters and WHO offices in the Eastern Mediterranean and European regions. As pathogens do not respect national borders, regional outbreaks require collective regional surveillance, response, accountability, and responsibility.",

For example, each member state has to ensure that it has the laboratory capacity to rapidly identify outbreaks;1, 6 to do so, provisions for technical support and extra resources for less-developed countries also are written into the revised IHR (2005).1 The core response capacity requirements apply at all public health response levels\u2014from local to intermediate to national.9 Strengthening national public health capacities contributes to improving national and international readiness to detect, verify, investigate, and control disease outbreaks that have the potential to spread internationally.7 Importantly, the revised IHR specify measures to prevent disease spread at designated points of entry.6, 9\n",

Moreover, each country's particular strengths can be leveraged across regional network partner nations. MECIDS and MBDS have acted as catalysts for the introduction and spread of new communications and laboratory technologies. For example, MBDS members are working with several international funding and technical partners to increase technical capacity for surveillance and disease control through computing; high-speed Internet access recently has been enhanced by the Trans-Eurasia Information Network 2 effort in Vietnam. When Vietnam lacked such Internet capacity in 2006, Thailand facilitated Vietnam's participation in the multinational videoconference on pandemic preparedness (organized by APEC Emerging Infections Network) by hosting the Vietnamese representatives at their videoconference center. As another example, tabletop exercises in individual MBDS countries and a regional MBDS exercise suggest that each country has unique strengths that can be considered for application across the region, such as electronic surveillance reporting in China; epidemiology training in Thailand; laboratory capacity in Thailand, China, and Vietnam; community surveillance in Cambodia; and government organization for national influenza preparedness in Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) (Dr. Moe Ko Oo, MBDS Coordinator, personal communication, 2008).",

This effort has been facilitated through the MECIDS collaboration with donors, coordinated by GHSI (the World Bank, the government of the United Kingdom, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, IBM, and Becton Dickenson). Financial and other forms of support were carefully used to enhance capabilities, particularly in early detection and identification, and to bring the partners' differing capabilities to a level at which they can operate efficiently together in sharing data and other cooperative activities. Thus, the regional network provides a forum for sharing lessons learned and, over time, harmonizing such efforts to assure systems (and operator) interoperability.",

This article has addressed the rise of regional networks and focused on how two such networks have contributed to the implementation of the IHR. Specifically, through hosting regional workshops for IHR implementation, introducing and implementing communications and laboratory technologies in member countries, responding to regional outbreak events, and linking field investigation efforts to response, the networks have moved their member groups closer to the implementation goal. Far from diminishing the abilities of fragile public health systems, these networks have reinforced operational competence.",

The trust and communication MECIDS and MBDS partners built were a foundation for upgrading the infectious disease surveillance systems in each country, in terms of training personnel and purchasing laboratory and information technology equipment. Through successful communication and capacity building, these networks have effectively responded to disease outbreaks (eg, MECIDS's response to the 2006 outbreak of avian influenza and MBDS's response to the cholera outbreaks of 2007) and increased their ability to address future emerging infectious disease threats. As is true with MBDS and MECIDS, regional networks have greater access to international investors whose objectives are to strengthen the health of recipient countries while also improving overall global health security. Investment is a key concept in the new paradigm; it is an idea that the return on an investment in surveillance capacity and cross-border cooperation is the improved health of all nations and all global citizens. The revised IHR (2005) provide the impetus for change, and regional networks are one important way of achieving that change.",
