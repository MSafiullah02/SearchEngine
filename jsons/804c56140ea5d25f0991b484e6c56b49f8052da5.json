Data of Hubei province were compared with those of the other 9 provinces. The differences and characteristics of the SV of COVID-19-related symptoms, and the correlations between the SV of COVID-19 and the number of newly confirmed/suspected cases were analyzed. The lag effects were discussed. Results Comparing the SV from January 1, 2020 to February 20, 2020 with those for the same period of the previous three years, Hubei's SV for cough, fever, diarrhea, chest tightness, dyspnea, and other symptoms were significantly increased. The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms was significantly higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms (P\uff1c0.001). The SV of COVID-19 in Hubei province was significantly correlated with the number of newly confirmed/suspected cases (r confirmed = 0.723, r suspected = 0.863, both P< 0.001). The results of the distributed lag model suggested that the patients who searched relevant symptoms on the Internet may begin to see doctors in 2-3 days later and be confirmed in 3-4 days later. Conclusion The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms was higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms, and the SV of diarrhea also increased significantly. It warned us to pay attention to not only the symptoms of the lower respiratory tract but also the gastrointestinal symptoms, especially diarrhea in patients with COVID-19. Internet search behavior had a positive correlation with the number of newly confirmed/suspected cases, suggesting that big data has an important role in the early warning of infectious diseases.",

For the time being, this new disease is not well understood. The previous studies and the plan of diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19 (China trial version 7) indicated that its main symptoms included fever, cough, and fatigue, while the symptoms of the upper respiratory tract, such as nasal obstruction, runny nose, sore throat, and other nasal symptoms wererare. [5] [6] [7] [8] The Internet big data is of great value to the monitoring of infectious diseases and a beneficial supplement to the traditional surveillance systems. 9 At the end of 2019,China had a total of 854 million web users, 10, 11 most of whom (more than 90%) used the Baidu search engines, 12 which was the world's largest mandarin search engine and mostly used Chinese website to acquire medical information. 12 The previous studies indicated that the search volume (SV) of symptom keyword was highly correlated with the symptom of patients, which can reflect the real trend of public demand. [13] [14] [15] [16] The Baidu Index Platform(http://index.baidu.com), a Google Trend equivalent to the most popular search engine (Baidu) in China, provides search data (SV) for many keywords in each city. To some extent, the SV of keywords in Baidu can reflect the real demands of citizens. Inorder to understand COVID-19's symptom characteristics, the Baidu search-engine data was conducted in our study.",

In this study, we found that cough and fever were the most searched symptoms for people in Hubei province based on the big data from the Baidu Index (Fig.   3A ). The SV of upper respiratory tract symptoms such as nasal obstruction, runny nose, sneezing, and sore throat were lower, while the SV of lower respiratory tract symptoms such as chest tightness, dyspnea, shortness of breath and chest pain were higher (Fig. 3C) , which was consistent with the symptoms of COVID-19 reported in the previous studies and the plan of diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19 (China trial version 7). [5] [6] [7] [8] The reason why the upper respiratory tract symptoms were less than the lower respiratory tract may be related to the fact that ACE2 receptors were widely distributed in lung tissues and less distributed in the nasal cavity and nasopharyngeal mucosa. Single-cell sequencing data analysis showed that the average proportion of ACE2-positive type \u2161 alveolar cells was only about 1%. The respiratory epithelial cells from the lower respiratory tract sample contained about 2% ACE2 positive cells while almost no cells obtained from nasal and bronchial samples showed high ACE2 expression, which indicated that the lower respiratory tract was considered as high risk, while the nasal cavity was in low risk. 17 Therefore, we speculate that after the SARS-CoV-2 reaches the respiratory tract and lungs, it bindsto the ACE2 receptor and replicates, damaging the respiratory tract and lungs and causing viremia, which manifests as cough and fever. The virus may then reach and infect other organs with ACE2. In severe cases, it can trigger an \"immune inflammation storm\", which can lead to multiple organ failure and even death.",

Therefore, there may be a close correlation between the popularity of online search and the confirmed/suspected cases. However, this correlation is not immediate. The potential patients who search for symptoms related to COVID-19 on the internet will gradually become suspected/confirmed cases in a subsequent period, which means there is a lag effect. In the current study, the results of the distribution lag models indicated that the infected people who search for related symptoms on the internet might start to see doctors and become suspected cases in about 2 to 3 days later, and be confirmed in about 3 to 4 days, which was similar to the National Health Commission's announcement that the national average time from onset to confirmation was 4.95 days. 27 Besides, we know that the number of the newly confirmed is affected by the diagnostic criteria, while the SV is not affected by this. However, especially, due to the changes of diagnostic criteria, the number of newly confirmed cases in Hubei province suddenly increased on February 12, rapidly decreased on February 13, and then gradually decreased in the following days, suggesting that the overall trend of newly confirmed was stable.

Compared with the data of traditional surveillance systems, the internet big data has the characteristics of large sample size, fast response, easy access, and low cost.

The overall trends were consistent with the SV of COVID-19 (Fig. 2A) but were inconsistent with the SV of diseases with similar symptoms of COVID-19, such as COPD, rhinitis, gastroenteritis, and CHD(Fig. 2B). Compared with the average of the other 9 impacted provinces, it could be seen that the SV of the top 5 symptoms in Hubei province had also increased significantly (all P<0.001,Fig. 4B), which had a positive relationship with the actual number of patients.4. Correlation analysis between newly confirmed/suspected cases and the Baidu indexThe curves of newly confirmed/suspected cases were closely correlated to the Baidu index curve in Hubei province(Fig. 5A, r confirmed = 0.723, r suspected = 0.863, all P< 0.001). The results of the distributed lag models showed that for the newly confirmed, order lag effect items in each model were statistically significant. Starting from the 5-order lag model, the R 2 only increased by 0.02 to 0.04, and the effects were not obvious. lag effect items in each model had statistical significance. Starting from the 4-order lag model, the increases in R 2 were less than 0.03, and the effects were not obviousThe results of the other 9 impacted provinces were similar. The Baidu index of the day was analyzed with the number of newly confirmed/suspected cases after 7 days by Spearman Correlation Analysis(Fig. 5B). The coefficients of correlation were 0.727 and 0.828, respectively, and the P values were all <0.001. After taking the natural logarithm, distributed lag models were established. For the newly confirmed, the R 2 of the 0 to 3-order lag models were 0.278, 0.6643, 0.7786, and 0.8239, respectively, and the lag effect items were statistically significant. Starting from the 4-order lag model, R 2 only increased by about 0.01, and the effects were not obvious. For the newly suspected, the R 2 of the 0 to 3-order lag models were 0.1524, 0.5343, 0.7758, and 0.8816, respectively. The R 2 increased significantly, and the corresponding lag effect items in each model had statistical significance. Starting from the 4-order lag model, the increases in R 2 were less than 0.03, and the effects were not obvious.Discussion1. The Internet big data helps recognize and monitor new diseasesWith the continuous development of the Internet and the substantial increase of network coverage in China, search engines had increasingly become the most important channel for people to query medical information.\"Searching online before visiting doctors\" had become a habit of patients and their families in China. The search keywords directly reflect the real intentions and needs of the patients,[13][14][15][16] and the big data of search could be real-time statistics and easy to obtain. Therefore, the internet big data, which are large enough, could become an ideal data source for us to recognize the characteristics of new infectious diseases and to monitor them. During this epidemic, a series of \"big data report on the search for COVID-19\" were jointly released by People's Daily Online and Baidu, which indicated the average daily number of users searching for information related to COVID-19 exceeded 1 billion on Baidu. The focuses of these reports were epidemic progress and daily preventative methods. Unfortunately, the reports did not cover the search trend related to symptoms of COVID-19. Therefore, we investigated the symptom characteristics of COVID-19 by analyzing the Baidu search-engine data and identified possible awareness gaps if possible. The results of this study showed that the Baidu search-engine truly reflected the user 's search behavior and the prevalence and symptom characteristics of COVID-19, which could help us to understand this new disease.",

The changing trend of SV for symptoms not only reflected people's real need but also had significant implications for our health departments to recognize the characteristics of new diseases, predict the epidemic trend and formulate strict guidelines for diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible. However, we must be clear that this correlation between the data of search and those of real world is not equal to causation, and it may be influenced by many factors, such as the differences in education and economic conditions of netizens. Besides, there are some other limitations to our study. Firstly, the SV of keywords could be influenced by the continuous changes of individual search behavior, and the Baidu Index Platform still has some keywords not included, which may lead to underestimation of the correlation.Secondly, the keywords of symptoms in this study were identified based on the symptoms recorded among COVID-19 patients. As the public knowledge of the pandemic and the awareness of COVID-19 gradually increases, the included search keywords should be increased accordingly, and even the search keywords for reasonably suspected symptoms should be monitored to fully utilize big data in preventing and controlling new infectious diseases. Finally, using internet search data to assist epidemic surveillance depends on the number of internet visits. The primary users of the internet search engines in China are young and middle-aged, and different regions have different population sizes so that the internet training for all people, especially the aged, should be strengthened in the future to provide more accurate and valuable data.",
