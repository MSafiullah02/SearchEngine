Army ANT is an open source framework that takes a step forward in generalizing information retrieval research, so that modern approaches can be easily integrated in a shared evaluation environment. We present an overview on the system architecture of Army ANT, which has four main abstractions: (i) readers, to iterate over text collections, potentially containing associated entities and triples; (ii) engines, that implement indexing and searching approaches, supporting different retrieval tasks and ranking functions; (iii) databases, to store additional document metadata; and (iv) evaluators, to assess retrieval performance for specific tasks and test collections. We also introduce the command line interface and the web interface, presenting a learn mode as a way to explore, analyze and understand representation and retrieval models, through tracing, score component visualization and documentation.",

Over the years, there have been several experimental frameworks in information retrieval. Some of the most notable include the Lemur Project [1] , Terrier [10] and, more recently, Nordlys [8] , which is also focused on entity-oriented search. Army ANT was created as a structured framework for testing novel retrieval approaches in a comprehensive manner, even when potentially deviating from traditional paradigms. This required a flexible structure, that we developed by iteratively satisfying the requirements of multiple engine implementations for representing and retrieving combined data [4, Definition 2.3 ]. An important step in research, that we also motivate and support through our framework, is the continuous documentation of models and collections, which is fundamental for reproducibility, but also useful to advance research, by exploring, learning and building on previous approaches.",

            "text": "The basic unit of Army ANT is the engine, which must implement the representation model for indexing and the retrieval model for searching. The indexing method has access to one of multiple collection readers and can optionally consider external features. The search method is based on a keyword query, pagination parameters and, optionally, a task identifier, a ranking function and its parameters, and a debug flag. For searching and evaluating over the web interface, each engine is required to have a unique identifier, which frequently describes the representation model and indexed collection (e.g., lucene-wapo for a Lucene index over the TREC Washington Post Corpus (WaPo) 1 ). Each engine has an entry in the YAML configuration file (config.yaml ), so that it is visible to the web interface. Supported ranking functions, their parameter names and specific values can also be defined in the configuration file. Combinations of selected parameter values can then be used by the evaluation module to launch individual runs, known as evaluation tasks. When completed, each task will provide a performance overview, based on efficiency and effectiveness metrics for each parameter configuration, as well as complementary visualizations and a ZIP archive with intermediate results. Intermediate results include elements like the average precisions for each topic, used in the calculation of the mean average precision, or the results for each individual topic, along with the relevance per retrieved item, according to a ground truth (e.g., qrels from TREC or INEX). This means that, even if Army ANT evolves and no backward compatibility is maintained, the archive can still be downloaded and independently used to compute other metrics, such as statistical tests, or to correct any wrong calculations. Additionally, an overall table, comparing the performance among different runs, is also available for download as a CSV or L A T E X file.",

It also provides a Lucene baseline engine, supporting TF-IDF, BM25 and divergence from randomness, a Lucene features helper, to index and combine external features using the sigmoid approach by Craswell et al. [5] , a TensorFlow Ranking [11] engine, which uses Lucene to compute features, and other experimental engines, such as graph-of-entity [6] and hypergraph-of-entity [7] . The latter model supports several tasks, including ad hoc document retrieval (with entities) [ Army ANT also provides several utility functions, covering DBpedia and Wikidata access, as well as statistics for the measurement of rank concordance and correlation. Several index inspection, debugging tools and documentation strategies are also integrated into Army ANT's workflow. The workbench is written in Python, providing integrated implementations for engines written in Java and C++, which we use as examples of cross-language interoperability. ",

It shows some of the supported implementations, namely readers and evaluators, for both disk-based and REST-based data, and it illustrates feature providers, such as word2vec similarities, that can also be integrated into an index (e.g., providing contextual similarity links to the hypergraph-of-entity).
