In late December 2019, the disease COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, the capital Hubei province, China, and causing the first pandemic of this century. Since the start of the year 2020, the infectious disease COVID-19 has started to spread globally and resulting in almost three million positive cases till today (till 27th April, 2020 there with about one million closed cases having a 20% death rate). As we understand, the disease COVID-19 has become a pandemic due to several reasons. Some of them are (i) unavailability of both suitable vaccine and exact medicine, (ii) high disease transmission rate, and (iii) the precise nature of the virus SARS-CoV-2 being still unknown. As many as 210 countries and territories around the globe have been suffering from COVID-19 today [see [16]].",

In particular, lockdown in high dense countries may reduce the disease transmission rate, although complete control may not be achievable. Hence to alive the economic status of a country, a full lockdown for an indefinite period is not desirable at all in any circumstances. Therefore there should be a suitable balance between the two different characteristics of governmental policies complete lockdown and healthy free conditions.",

However, there may be some infected persons whose infection is so mild that the person would recover due to innate immunity even before the hospitalization. Thus in this article, by the term \u2019infected\u2019 person, we will mean those persons who are hospitalized. Further, we assume that the medical personals assisting COVID-19 positive hospitalized individuals have taken necessary protective items. Thus to keep simplicity, we believe that only exposed persons and asymptomatic infected persons can spread the disease. Still, the infected persons who are hospitalized in due course are not spreading the virus. Although the effect of COVID-19 started not more than six months ago, some significant works have already been done or are undergoing to expose COVID-19 with the help of suitable mathematical models. Kucharski et al. [26] have proposed a mathematical model-based analysis of COVID-19, where the authors have considered all the positive cases of Wuhan, China, till 5th March 2020. In another recent work, Ndairou et al. [35] have presented an autonomous system of mathematical model to study the spread of COVID-19 in the Wuhan city, Chiana. Using mathematical modeling, Prem et al [38] have analyzed the controlling status of COVID-19 of Wuhan city. Hellewell et al. [15] have described the effective procedure of COVID-19 disease using isolation. In another work, Mizumoto and Chowell [33] have studied the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in the international conveyance, Diamond Princess Cruises Ship. The basic reproduction number is an important parameter to analyze the nature of an infectious disease. In their work, Liu et al. [30] have investigated the possible numerical value of the basic reproduction number of COVID-19. In a recent article, Fanelli and Piazza [7] have analyzed and predicted the nature of COVID-19 in three most affected countries till March 2020 with the help of mathematical modelling. Ribeiro et al. [39] have used some stochastic based regression models to forecast the phenomena in as many as ten most affected states of Brazil. In other recent work, Chakraborty and Ghosh [4] have considered a hybrid ARIMA-WBF model to forecast various COVID-19 affected countries throughout the globe.",

Addition of detail and complexity can make models more accurate but this also complicates their mathematics. However, even this kind of simple model is very helpful when formal vaccination or proper treatment control is not available. Motivated by this, in the present paper, we propose a mathematical model introducing a quarantine class and governmental intervention measures like lockdown, media coverage on social distancing, and improvement of public hygiene, etc to mitigate disease transmission. The main purpose of this work is to explore the role of quarantine and the governmental intervention strategies on COVID-19 control and elimination. We study a thorough dynamical behavior of the model in terms of the basic reproduction number. Further, we perform the sensitivity analysis of the essential reproduction number and found that reducing the contact of exposed and susceptible humans is the most critical factor in achieving disease control. To lessen the infected individuals as well as to minimize the cost of implementing government control measures, we formulate an optimal control problem, and optimal control is determined. Finally, we predict a short-term trend of COVID-19 for the three most affected states, Maharashtra, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu, in India, and it suggests that the first two states need further monitoring of control measures to reduce the contact of exposed and susceptible humans.",

            "text": "In this section, we formulate a mathematical model on COVID-19 based on some realistic assumptions. At any time instant t, the human populations are subdivided into five time-dependent classes, namely Susceptible S(t), Exposed E(t), Hospitalized infected I(t), Quarantine Q(t) and Recovered or Removed R(t). Based on those five state variables, we aim to form an autonomous system using first-order differential equations. Let A be the constant recruitment rate to the susceptible population, and \u03b2 be the disease transmission rate. However the disease transmission from vulnerable to infected persons (here the class E) depends on several parameters, namely, precautions (use of face mask, social distancing, not rubbing face and nose using hand, etc.) and hygienic environment (use of soap and sanitizer, hand washing, cleaning, etc.) taken by both susceptible as well as infected persons. Since here, we have assumed that the virus of COVID-19 is spreading when a vulnerable person comes into contact with an exposed person; therefore we think that \u03c1\n1(0 < \u03c1\n1 < 1) portion of susceptible human would maintain proper precaution measure and \u03c1\n2(0 < \u03c1\n2 < 1) portion of the exposed class would take proper precaution measure for disease transmission (i.e., use of face mask, social distancing and implementing hygiene). Therefore the disease can only be transmitted to the (1\u2212\u03c11)S portion of susceptible individuals due to the contact of (1\u2212\u03c12)E portion of exposed individuals with a bi-linear disease transmission rate \u03b2. We know that a person is whether infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus or not can be clinically detected using RT-PCR examination and a person with negative results in the RT-PCR test may still be COVID-19 positive as it may take some days (from 7 to 21 days) to express infection. Therefore, the portion with positive COVID-19 of the class of population E is considered as infected, and they are hospitalized. Let \u03b1 and b\n2 be the portions of the exposed class goes to the infected class and quarantine class, respectively. It should be noted that 0<\u03b1+b2<1 since it would take quite a long time to get the output of the RT-PCR test, and sometimes it requires more than one RT-PCR analysis for a single person for confirmation of COVID-19. Let among the quarantine classes of populations, cQ portion of communities move to infected level, and the b\n1\nQ part would become susceptible to the disease after the quarantine period. Let \u03b7 and \u03c3 be respectively recovery rate of the hospitalized infected populations I and exposed class E. Let d be the natural death rate, which is common to all classes of communities and \u03b4 be the COVID-19 induced death rate. Also, it is statistically observed a person once recovered from the disease COVID-19 has very little chance to become infected again for the same disease. Hence, we assume that no portion of the recovered population moves to the susceptible class back. Also, in the formulation of a mathematical model, we understand that the people of the hospitalized infected class (i.e., I(t)) would not be spreading the disease or spreading a negligible amount of disease since they are kept completely isolated from the susceptible individuals. However, to control the pandemic COVID-19, suitable governmental measures (like complete or semi lockdown, rationing system, continue media coverage on social isolation and improvement of public hygiene, home deliveries of essential commodities, to make an alternate source of income for job-losers during the lockdown, etc.) have been implemented by the various governmental and non-governmental agencies. Thus this policy may be considered as one of the effective control tools, and mainly the susceptible population of COVID-19 cases would be benefited due to this policy. Mathematically we represent this policy by the parameter M and let this policy be implemented at a rate p. Therefore due to the implementation of this policy, the portion, pSM moves from susceptible to the recovered or removed class (R(t)). It should be noted that usually, the parameter M should be time-dependent as for the optimum result, the policy should be applied according to the necessity of the situation and keeping a proper balance between two different states, namely lockdown and complete free state. However, in the qualitative analysis of this model, we assume the parameter M as time-independent, but in formulating an optimal control problem to keep the infected individuals at the minimum level, M is assumed as a time-dependent control M(t), where indeed 0 \u2264 M(t) \u2264 1. Based on the above assumptions, we present a schematic diagram of the proposed COVID-19 system in Fig. 1\n. Further, based on the above-stated assumptions and the flow diagram of COVID-19, we formulate an autonomous a dynamical system consisting of five first-order differential equations shown as below:",

It is noticed that in presence of control, exposed, quarantine and infected population increases slower than the absence of the control. Similarly, in presence of control, susceptible population decreases faster than the absence of the control and recovered population increases faster than the absence of the control. These real phenomena justify our proposed model. In Fig. 9\n, we plot the evolution of the variations of adjoint or costate variables and the control parameter are depicted in the Fig. 10\n.

India, the second most populated country, has also been affected severely due to the global pandemic COVID-19. In this paper, we analyze the effect of COVID-19 cases in three states in three different parts of India.

Starting from Wuhan city in December 2019, the virus SARS-CoV-2 has spread throughout as many as 210 countries and territories and continues to increase its pandemic nature. In the absence of proper vaccination and treatment of COVID-19, one would rely on qualitative control of the disease rather than complete eradication. Since these types of situations are unknown to present society, in these circumstances, various governments have taken some policies to control the destructive nature of the disease as much as possible. To study the dynamics of the disease, in this article, we have proposed and analyzed a classical SEIR type mathematical model to incorporate the COVID-19 scenarios in the system (1). A detailed analysis shows that the proposed system posses two equilibria, namely one disease-free and one endemic whose existence and asymptotic stability criteria depend on the numerical value of basic reproduction number R\n0. We have also established that the proposed system (1) undergoes a transcritical bifurcation at the threshold R0=1. To study the impact of the government control measures to prevent the extensive transmission of COVID-19, we have introduced a control parameter M. Further, to reduce the infected individuals as well as to minimize the cost of implementing government control measures, an objective functional has been formed and solved using Pontryagin\u2019s maximum principle. The optimal control follows a combination of bang-bang and singular control during its application. We also have discussed the sensitivity index of the threshold parameter R\n0 and found the most sensitive parameter, which has a positive impact on R\n0 is the disease transmission rate.",

In Table 3 (3 and 4\n), we provide the data of COVID-19 confirmed, active, recovered, and death cases of these three states starting from 2nd March 2020, till 27th April 2020. In table 5 and table 6, we estimate the parametric values associated with the model system (1). Finally, using the software Mathematica, we try to fit our model (1) to estimate the nature of COVID-19 in those three states of India. In Fig. 11, Fig. 12, and Fig. 13, we present the active COVID-19 cases in Maharashtra, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu, respectively, for 91 days starting from 2nd March 2020, till the 31st of May 2020. In particular, we use the existing data for the first 57 days (till 27th April 2020) collecting from the websites of the Government of India and WHO to forecast the probable active COVID-19 cases in those three states for the rest of 34 days. It should be noted that here we can forecast the nature of the COVID-19 for the short term only as the Governmental policy would change in time to time resulting in the corresponding changes in the associated parameters of the proposed model system. From those three figures, we can claim that on 31st May 2020, the active cases of the three states Maharashtra, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu, will be around 46183, 3344, and 411 respectively.

            "text": "The primary finding of this article is that we have derived a mathematical model that can be used to study the qualitative dynamics of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number and its sensitivity analysis would determine the controlling procedure of the disease. Also, we have incorporated the governmental policy in our mathematical model and proposed a linear objective functional considering that governmental policy as the time-dependent control parameter. On the other hand, it should be noted that the estimated values of COVID-19 in the three different states of India in three different parts are forecasted using existing parametric space only. In the case of the first two states, Maharashtra and Delhi we see that the graph shows an increasing trend whereas for the state Tamil Nadu, the predicted data shows that the disease can be controlled with the existing parametric space. The main two burdens behind the control of COVID-19 are (i) the unconsciousness of the people about the disease and (ii) the high population density exposed the infection when the common people are out for their essential commodities. Moreover, the weakness of forecasting cumulative COVID-19 cases in the three states of India is that here the forecast is done on totally some existing parametric conditions. But human behaviour is the most uncertain phenomena. Hence, if the corresponding parametric space has been altered then there may be some changes in the graphs of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, in this article, we are targeting to forecast the COVID-19 cases on a short term basis and henceforth there would be very little chance to change in corresponding parametric space. But the framework of the current model gives some important insights into the dynamics of COVID-19 spread and control. Further, our simulation works suggest that both the quarantine and governmental intervention strategies like lockdown, media coverage on social distancing and public hygiene can play an important role in diminishing COVID-19 transmission. However, the successes of these strategies mainly rely on the proper implementation of the process. In our future work, we need to extend our model by incorporating some essential biological as well as epidemiological factors. To be given some examples, we may mention the acquired immunity in humans, differential susceptibility and infectivity of humans to COVID-19 infection, and spatial heterogeneity.",
