The T-G-T loop contacts thrombin directly [31], therefore, the stem-and-loop structure was inserted into the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer at the 3\u2032-end T-T loop or 5\u2032-end T-T loop. We designed the stem-and-loop structure inserted into the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer in such a way that the conformational change in stem-and-loop structure would lead to a conformational change in the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer, which would in turn cause a decrease in the inhibitory effect of the whole complex on thrombin.",

This structure is known to be destroyed during hybridization of its target DNA with the loop part. The diameter of a DNA double helix (approximately 20 \u00c5) is longer than the distance between two Gs of the G-quartet structure (approximately 17 \u00c5). Therefore, we expected that the difference would cause the distortion and destabilization of the G-quartet structure if the stem-and-loop structure were to be directly connected to the G-quartet structure. Therefore, we constructed two kinds of thrombin-inhibiting aptamers: one was a thrombin-inhibiting aptamer which has the stem-and-loop structure inserted at the 3\u2032-end T-T loop directly (AES 1), and the other was a thrombin-inhibiting aptamer, to which a stem-and-loop structure with two additional T bases, one at the 3\u2032-end and one at the 5\u2032-end, was attached at the 3\u2032-end of the T-T loop of the G-quartet structure (AES 2).",

The clotting time was approximately 10 s in the presence of only thrombin (Fig. 3\nA, bar 1); the addition of the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer resulted in the extension of the clotting time to approximately 150 s, since it inhibited thrombin activity (bar 2). The clotting time was approximately 19 s in the presence of AES 1 (data not shown); however, it was approximately 45 s in the presence of AES 2, which has two additional T bases insertion (bar 3). This result indicates that the two additional T bases insertion prevented the G-quartet structure from becoming distorted. Although the inhibitory activity of AES 2 did not change in the presence of the 15-mer control DNA, which does not hybridize with it (bar 4), the clotting time for the AES 2 changed from 45 to 26 s as a result of the addition of its 15-mer target DNA (bar 5).

For these AESs, the local T\nm of the stem-and-loop structure were predicted by the mfold program as follows: 67.9 \u00b0C at the loop site, and 55.6, 62.9, and 69.8 \u00b0C at the 6-, 7-, and 8-bp stem sites, respectively. Namely, when the T\nm of the stem site was lower than that of the loop site, the AES did not fold into a G-quartet structure, and when the T\nm of stem site was higher than that of the loop site, the AES structure seemed not to be disrupted by the hybridization with the target DNA. These results are similar to those obtained for molecular beacons, which suggests that the dehybridization of the stem site induced by the hybridization between the target DNA and the loop site is related to the disruption of the G-quartet structure.",

The G-quartet structure of the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer plays an important role in the inhibitory action of the aptameric complex on thrombin. In other words, these AESs would be destroyed when they hybridized with their target DNAs because they fold into G-quartet structures.

When comparing the CD spectrum produced by subtracting the spectrum of the stem-and-loop DNA sequence from that of AES SARS 1 with that of the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer, we can see that the peaks near 265 and 250 nm shifted to 273 and 253 nm, respectively, and that the positive peak at 295 nm was weak. The anti-parallel G-quartet structure had a positive peak near 295 and 250 nm, and a negative peak at 265 nm, and these peaks disappeared due to the destabilization of the G-quartet structure [36]. This suggests that AES SARS 1 folds into a G-quartet structure, but that the G-quartet structure of AES SARS 1 is unstable compared with the structure of the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer. This hypothesis is supported by the results for AES SARS 1, which showed lower thrombin-inhibiting activity than the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer, since the stability of the G-quartet structure of the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer relates to the thrombin-inhibiting activity.",

Although the N7 of guanine is methylated by dimethyl sulfate (DMS), an oligonucleotide folded into a G-quartet structure is protected from N7 methylation since the N7 of one guanine forms a hydrogen bond with the N2 of another guanine to form the G-quartet structure. The DMS footprinting assay was performed on FITC-labeled AES SARS 1, FITC-labeled AES SARS 1 hybridized with its target DNA, and FITC-labeled 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer containing potassium ions or not. In the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer, the potassium ions are necessary for G-quartet structure folding. Therefore, as shown Fig. 6\n, the guanine residues composing the G-quartet structure (G9, G10, G13, G14, G18, G19, G22, and G23) were exposed to N7 methylation in the absence of potassium ions (lanes 1 and 2). In AES SARS 1, although G49 and G50 (residues corresponding to G22 and G23 in the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer, respectively) were not detected, G9, G10, G13, G14, G18, and G19 (residues corresponding to G9, G10, G13, G14, G18, and G19 in the 31-mer thrombin-inhibiting aptamer, respectively) were protected from N7 methylation (lanes 3 and 5). The N7 methylation of the guanine residues of AES SARS 1 did not change the residues in the presence of the 15-mer control DNA; however, they were not protected from N7 methylation in the presence of the target DNA (lane 6). These results indicate that AES SARS 1 has a G-quartet structure and that it is destroyed during hybridization with the target DNA.",

In this study, we constructed a new AES whose function changes upon hybridization with the target DNA. This DNA detection system is very simple compared to other reported DNA sensing systems, because it is simply an unmodified oligonucleotide; the only preparatory procedure is the insertion of a stem-and-loop structure into the aptamer, and so the system can be applied to any aptamer. We had already developed different types of AESs by connecting a thrombin-inhibiting aptamer to target-molecule-binding aptamers, one of which was used for adenosine detection [24]. With those AES systems, target molecules can be detected by measuring the thrombin activity. Therefore, we believe that it is possible to detect many target DNAs, RNAs, low-mass molecules, and proteins in a common assay using AESs.",
