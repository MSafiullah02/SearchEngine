At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the crisis plans for the Surgical Division were to prioritize the manning of the NCID SC while still preserving emergency surgical capabilities, level 1 trauma center capability, contribution of anesthetists to the ICU, and phased reduction in elective procedures and clinic consultations.",

At TTSH, the elective lists were reduced by 30% in early February 2020 to 50% in March 2020. Life-saving or limb-saving procedures, such as oncology and limb revascularization operations, were prioritized. There are many considerations, both medical and logistical, when deciding to cancel or postpone surgical procedures. They include:1.Reducing the manpower (surgeons, anesthetists, scrub nurses, allied health workers) requirements in the OT to balance the manpower assigned to NCID while maintaining urgent surgery capabilities;2.Reducing chance of undiagnosed COVID-19 patients entering the \u201cclean\u201d OT, risking disease transmission and compromising provider safety;3.Freeing up ICU resources and manpower in TTSH in case of a surge of COVID-19 patients requiring advanced life support;4.Analyzing medical risk-benefit by weighing acuity of elective surgery and risks of postponement of surgery with input from the primary surgeons and heads of services; and5.Need for postoperative inpatient care in general ward, high-dependency units and ICU.\n",

Patients with time-sensitive results, needing emergent surgery, or those who are symptomatic are booked into clinic slots; those on follow-up for chronic conditions or with nonurgent results have their appointments postponed. Where possible, such as discussing nonurgent results, consults are done by telephone, and this helps to allay the anxiety in patients. Provisions are made for patients to refill chronic medication without clinic consultation, with an option for courier delivery service. New referrals are also screened by consultants and appointments deferred, depending on presenting complaint.",

Supply and consumption rate informs clinical leads whether to modify practice, PPE policy, and use of alternatives.\n",

These were our considerations when fulfilling these roles:1.Preservation of emergency surgical response takes top priority. Critical services such as trauma, vascular surgery, neurosurgery, and thoracic surgery must continue to be operational when designing rosters for the NCID SC.2.Just-in-time training for surgical staff, including use of ED electronic medical records, and on-the-ground walkabout to ensure familiarity with NCID processes.3.Adequate supervision by ED physicians, who decide on management, and disposition plans to reduce the cognitive load and risk of error faced by surgeons in an unfamiliar environment.4.Adequate work-rest cycle for manpower sustainability. NCID SC staffing works on a shift system similar to that in the ED.\n",

This is important to maintain morale of staff, their confidence in the hospital leadership, and to reduce \u201cpresenteeism,\u201d which is prevalent among healthcare workers.3 Staff surveillance of temperature and sickness was instituted via an online portal for all hospital staff. All staff who were unwell were encouraged to report to the hospital's occupational health clinic or NCID SC, depending on their exposure risk. All staff working in TTSH had N95 mask fitting done at the time of their recruitment; however, to close any gaps, additional mask fitting sessions were organized with collaboration from the Infection Control department on very short notice. Each staff was fitted with at least 2 different models of N95 so that the staff could continue to work safely even if 1 model became unavailable due to supply issues. For relevant staff, just-in-time training was conducted on the use of the powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) and donning of personal protective equipment, with videos made available via several hospital e-learning platforms. All staff pantries' seating arrangements were redesigned, including in OT, to allow for adequate social distancing and with staggered mealtimes to reduce crowding.",

Senior leadership are also engaged in the instant messaging application, enabling smooth 2-way transfer of information, rapid problem-solving of issues on the ground, and \u201cflattening the hierarchy.\u201d Leaders also ensured that every batch of staff that were about to embark upon the \u201cCOVID-19 tour of duty\u201d in NCID were briefed, and alignment with the hospital mission made clear. Regular engagement with the staff by leadership, either in person or via teleconferencing, was also important for communicating information and updates on strategic direction. Nonessential overseas leave was also suspended to reduce the risk of overseas importation of COVID-19; this included pre-planned holidays, workshops, and conferences. Staff who had to travel overseas required approval from senior hospital leadership and were placed on a 14-day leave of absence on return to mitigate any risk of importation of COVID-19.",

These small gestures from corporates, who themselves are seeing a challenging economic environment, and members of the public, serve to boost morale of the HCWs and strengthen the society's resolve to weather the crisis together. Within TTSH and NCID, the widespread use of murals of appreciation and corporate social media (Facebook, Workplace from Facebook) have allowed the sharing of personal stories and expression of appreciation by colleagues.",
