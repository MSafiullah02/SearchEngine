            "text": "Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is known to be highly prevalent in the cat population, especially in catteries (Addie and Jarrett, 1992, Pedersen, 1995, Fehr et al., 1997). FCoV causes mild gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases mainly in kittens (Pedersen et al., 1981) and, it is hypothesised, due to mutations during intestinal replication (Pedersen, 1995, Vennema et al., 1995), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). FIP is actually the most important fatal infectious disease in cats, \u22485\u201312% of seropositve cats develop lethal FIP (Addie and Jarrett, 1992, Fehr et al., 1997). The pathogenicity of FCoV leading to the FIP syndrome may be linked to increased replication due to a high FCoV load in a cat which can not be determined without a quantitative detection of the causative agent. The fact that FIP is still incurable emphasises that fighting FIP has to depend on preventive measures. Efficacious prevention can be accomplished by detection and separation of FCoV shedding from non shedding cats, resulting in the reduction of coronaviral load or even the elimination of FCoV from a cattery (Foley et al., 1997). Vaccination has been shown to be efficacious if the cats are FCoV naive at the time of vaccination (Fehr et al., 1997). Both strategies require a method to detect FCoV quantitatively, because only cats shedding FCoV at high level may transmit the virus to other cats (Foley et al., 1997).",

In addition, conventional PCR methods are time consuming due to several post-amplification steps, contain a certain risk of cross-contamination between the samples due to a separate labor-intensive reverse transcription (RT) step and a second PCR step in nested PCR systems, are limited in sensitivity and allow only relatively few samples to be processed at one time. The ideal method for FCoV detection should be quantitative, highly sensitive, fast, easy to handle, allow for a high sample throughput and contain a low risk of contamination.",

For absolute quantitation, a dilution series of FCoV RNA-standard is amplified with the samples.

A fluorescent reporter dye FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) is covalently attached to the 5\u2032 end of the probe and a quencher dye TAMRA (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) is covalently attached to the 3\u2032 end of the probe. The quencher dye absorbs the emission of the reporter dye by F\u00f6rster-type energy transfer while the probe is intact (F\u00f6rster, 1948). The 3\u2032 end of the probe is phosphorylated to prevent extension by the Tfl during the polymerisation steps. While the reporter dye emission is quenched due to the physical proximity of the quencher dye in the intact probe, the 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 exonuclease activity of Tfl polymerase leads to cleavage of the probe in the extension phase of the PCR cycle. The effect is a dislocation of the reporter dye and, as a result of the decrease of the energy transfer, a rise of the reporter\u2019s fluorescence. The resulting relative increase of the reporter dye\u2019s fluorescencent emission is measured in the course of every PCR cycle using a Perkin Elmer ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector, which is a combination of thermal cycler and luminescence spectrometer. The data are transferred to a connected computer where calculations and graphics are demonstrated by a special software.",

The 96-well plates used in the 7700 ABI Prism system might generate a problem of cross-contamination because pipetting has to be done with the PCR tubes open. All the wells used are only closed with rows of linked caps after pipetting.

The basis of this assay is a fluorogenic oligonucleotide, called TaqMan\u2122 probe, which is added to the RT-PCR mix. This fluorogenic probe is cleaved during the PCR polymerisation steps due to a 5\u2032 nuclease activity of the Tfl polymerase. While the unhybridised probe does not contribute significantly to the signal, the cleavage of the probe leads to the generation of fluorescence. This fluorescence is measured during each cycle by a luminescence spectrometer (ABI Prism 7700) and transferred to a connected computer, where graphics and calculations, for example standard curves or initial amounts of template in the samples, are automatically performed. The use of such a fluorogenic probe increases the level of specificity of the assay. This assay is a one-tube RT-PCR, where all ingredients for RT and PCR are mixed and RT-PCR is performed without additional handling or reopening of the tubes. No post amplification steps are required and calculation of the initial amount of viral particles is done by the software, resulting in a very short processing and assay time. RT-PCR testing of \u224890 samples, including pipetting, can be performed on a 96-well plate including some non template controls and standard dilutions in <6 h. The standard described, a cloned part of the highly conserved FCoV 7b gene, allows absolute quantitation of FCoV in clinical samples.",
