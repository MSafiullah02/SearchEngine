A 4F multi-hole catheter was advanced to the P3 segment of the popliteal artery and the tibio-peroneal trunk, with infusion of a 100.000 UI bolus of urokinase, followed by 50.000 UI per hour. Intravenous sodic Heparin was given at an anticoagulant dose. Serum Fibrinogen, INR, aPtt (target 1.7-2.3), CPK, Mioglobine and Creatinine were strictly monitored (every 6 hours), as shown in Table II .

The problem of coagulopathy in COVID-19 is getting increasing interest in the discussion about this pandemic disease. As a matter of fact, the pandemic COVID-19 determined recently a very significant increase of admissions to intensive care unit (ICU) of patients needing ventilation support. Other than an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), many patients suffered a number of other problems, such as renal failure, cardiac arrhythmia, myocarditis and coagulative disorders. 2 Some authors suggested a possible role of disseminated intravascular coagulation; also, elevated D-dimer serum concentration has shown to be an independent risk factors for mortality in different experiences. 3, 4 Although no data are available about the role of a possible hypercoagulable status in severely diseased patients, it is suggested that heparin can play a role in reducing mortality in severe COVID-19 patients. However, the available data on the heparin role concern only patients with ARDS and septic status. 5, 6 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

The catheter for thrombolysis was therefore removed and the patient was submitted to surgical exposure of the dorsalis pedis and retromalleolar posterior tibial arteries, with Fogarty embolectomy of extended proximally and distally to the pedal arch arteries. Fresh thrombotic material was removed, which was sent for histological assessment. Dorsalis pedis and tibialJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f posterior pulses reappeared, with a triphasic flow pattern of both anterior and posterior tibial arteries at ultrasound evaluation.",

First of all, the city of Bologna, Italy, where our case occurred, is in the second region for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a single vascular surgery unit for all the metropolitan area, accounting for one million citizens. During the first month of COVID-19 pandemic, 2334 patients were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the area, and the number of interventions or consultations for acute limb ischemias was similar with that of the same month of 2019, i.e. 2 cases in 2020 vs. 9 cases in 2019. Second important consideration is that both medical and surgical therapies delivered to that COVID-19 patient were successful, with no recurrences as it usually happens in prothrombotic cases. Antiphospholipid antibodies and alteration in D-dimer concentration have a low-specific value and, even if clearly evident in these patients, their direct cause effect relationship with acute embolism should be demonstrated.
