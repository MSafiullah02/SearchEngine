Cavitation also increases the propensity to haemoptysis (which may sometimes be massive) and that of cavitary colonization with a fungal ball (mycetoma) later on in healed disease. One third of all individuals affected with post-primary TB die within a few months (\"galloping consumption\") (Reported tuberculosis in the United States, 2013 2014).

False-positive NAAT results can occur due to laboratory contamination. Importantly, NAAT can detect nucleic acid from dead non-viable bacilli, and so a positive test after completion of the course of treatment has no relevance in that situation (Boyles et al. 2014) nor is it of relevance in monitoring response to treatment (Friedrich et al. 2013) .

            "text": "Definitive diagnosis has traditionally hinged on the culture characteristics of MTB: species discrimination can be achieved on the basis of colony morphology as well as on the basis of biochemical tests performed on the culture. Conventional culture (Lowenstein-Jensen medium and its variants) is capable of detecting as few as ten bacteria per millilitre with the sensitivity and specificity of sputum culture approximating 80 and 98%, respectively (Morgan et al. 1983) . Following initial culture, species identification is done by any of the following techniques: biochemical methods (testing, nucleic acid hybridization probes, high-pressure liquid chromatography or mass spectrophotometry). Drug sensitivity testing is subsequently carried out, usually at a reference laboratory (Shinnick and Good 1995) to first-line anti-tubercular agents, but sometimes to second-line agents as well when resistance to components of first-line anti-tubercular agents has been documented. In individuals living with HIV who have CD4 counts <100 cells/mm 3 , or those who are immunocompromised, Mycobacterial cultures of blood and urine should complement conventional testing. Point-of-care urinary detection of lipoarabinomannan, a component of the Mycobacterial cell wall (urine LAM test) may be useful for HIV-infected individuals, and its use may possibly confer a mortality benefit (Reported tuberculosis in the United States, 2013 2014). The future of point-of-care devices is next-generation sequencing, and, perhaps, innovations like detection of volatile organic compounds in exhaled breath (Garcia-Basteiro et al. 2018) Serological tests (tests for antibodies against TB) have poor sensitivity and specificity; false-positive tests are ubiquitous, and serologic testing for the diagnosis of TB is discouraged by the WHO.",

It is important to realize that TB can occur at all \"stages\" of HIV disease. The clinical presentation of HIV patients who have relatively high CD4 counts is no different to that which occurs in individuals without HIV. Such individuals manifest with the classical manifestations of post-primary tuberculosis such as upper lobe infiltrates. On the other hand, lower lobe involvement, pleural effusions and intrathoracic lymphadenopathy are common in individuals with low CD4 counts (typically <200/\u03bcL). Indeed the chest X-ray may sometimes only show vague interstitial infiltrates or even be normal (Mayer and Dukes Hamilton 2010) . Taken together, the fact that in advanced HIV disease (a) the sputum is less likely to be positive for AFB (b) the PPD is usually non-reactive (c) the X-ray abnormalities are likely to represent other opportunistic infections or even non-infective conditions associated with HIV disease and (d) histopathology of involved tissues is characterized by lack of typical granulomata; these considerations make the diagnosis extremely challenging in this setting.

Patients are regarded as treatment failures when a microbiologic indicator like sputum smear/culture for TB remains positive after 3-4 months of starting treatment or comes back positive after a period of remaining negative (fall and rise phenomenon) (Prasad et al. 2018) . Patients may respond for a short time after starting treatment or do not respond to treatment from the inception. In any case the implication of treatment failure is drug-resistant TB (see below), and strenuous efforts must be made to look for microbiological resistance to first-and, in the proper context, to second-line agents-by the available tools. Relapse, on the other hand, is the recurrence of TB after completion of treatment that has been successful, with documented culture negativity. Relapse may be due either to a reinfection or reactivation of the dormant bacillus. Drugresistant TB is to be considered in these settings.

Cavities colonized by fungi (aspergillomas), broncholiths eroding into the bronchial wall and rarely expansion and subsequent rupture of an unsupported blood vessel in the cavity wall (Rasmussen's aneurysm) can cause massive haemoptysis (van den Heuvel and van Rensburg 2006) . A scar carcinoma sometimes develops in an area of fibrosis and may sometimes be difficult to distinguish from a dense fibrotic infiltrate (Gao et al. 2015) . Post-tubercular bronchiectasis is predisposed to when caseation necrosis and inflammation with retention of secretions leads to destruction of bronchial walls with ensuing permanent dilatation. Sometimes compression of bronchial lumen by enlarged lymph node can produce bronchiectasis by a different mechanism. Postprimary TB involves the upper lobes of the lung, and so the gravitationally advantaged upper lobes do not usually undergo a process of chronic and recurrent infection unlike the lower lobes that are involved by bronchiectasis of other aetiologies.",

Side effects are possible with any of the anti-tubercular agents, and on rare occasions, they may be serious and even fatal. The risk of liver injury with anti-TB therapy is always a concern. Among the four first-line agents INH, rifampicin and pyrazinamide are all capable of causing hepatotoxicity. Isoniazid is capable of causing asymptomatic mild elevation in transaminases in 15-20% as well as fatal severe acute hepatitis in 0.05-1%. Jaundice with liver injury can occur in 0.5-1%. Peripheral neuropathy due to pyridoxine deficiency can occur with INH therapy in up to 6.5% of elderly individuals (Ruan et al. 2018 ); pyridoxine supplementation is required for all patients taking INH (John 2019). Factors increasing the chances of INH hepatotoxicity include age, female gender, alcohol use, prior hepatitis, concurrent use of cytochrome-inducing agents and slow acetylator status (Sharma et al. 2016) . Acute INH toxicity can present as seizures due to decreased GABA levels. INH is metabolized to several metabolites including the hepatotoxic metabolite hydrazine, toxic-free radicals and mono-methylhydrazine. Degradation by acetylation occurs via N-acetyltransferase-2 gene (NAT2); a deficiency of the NAT enzyme can lead to accumulation of hepatotoxic metabolite. Ten percent of patients with anti-tubercular drug-induced hepatotoxicity show progression to acute liver failure; the rest are self-limited (Badrinath and John 2018) .",

The regimen, even if retailed, might then still include one or more potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and these should be restarted one at a time, only when liver function tests return to their baseline (e.g. the transaminases fall to less than twice normal). In general, a cholestatic type of derangement would prompt addition of INH first; with a non-cholestatic picture, rifampicin could first be added (Sterling) . Needless to say, careful monitoring with frequent testing of serum liver function is required. Most physicians would omit pyrazinamide when restarting ATT except in the mildest of cases or with other compelling reasons (Sterling) .",

Within the next 16 years, the goal is to reduce TB incidence by 90% but the progress has been painfully slow.

Yet its effect has been inconsistent, ranging from 80% to zero protection; several factors including geographical differences appear to play a role (British adolescents had better responses than South Indian participants perhaps due to background exposure to MTB or atypical mycobacteria). The efficacy of BCG has been most manifested in its protection of infants and young children from the dangerous forms of TB (such as disseminated \"miliary\" TB and TB meningitis).
