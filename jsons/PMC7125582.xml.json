In addition, transient populations of contaminating bacteria, however, may also be naturally present, or may result from contamination during the skin retrieval process. Even the commensal bacteria may damage the skin if subsequently allowed to grow during the skin storage period to reach massive population densities. Therefore, it is important to try to eliminate or minimize the microbial population of skin before retrieval. This is generally achieved using skin prepping techniques similar to those used on the skin of patients undergoing operations in hospital. When banking skin in a viable state, it is important to validate that the prepping agents have been adequately removed before harvesting the skin, and that any residuals are not toxic to the skin cells.",

This results in a central necrosis that radiates out to eventually include all of the tissue.

Eventually, refrigerator storage for skin autografts became the norm in burn units. The simplest technique was to fold the skin so that the cut surfaces were in apposition and then wrap the skin sandwich in tulle gras and/or saline gauze to prevent desiccation.12, 13 Using this method, autologous skin can be used after around 2 weeks of storage, although cell viability is very low at this point. Unlike autograft, allograft has already lost some viability by the time it is retrieved; therefore, maximum storage times using this method are reduced to 7 or 8 days.14 Because extensive microbiology screening, however, is required, together with scrutiny of the medical records, postmortem report, and so on, this short storage period is insufficient.",

The general properties of cryoprotectants are that the molecules can pass through the cell membrane into the cell and be relatively nontoxic at very high multimolar concentrations. The commonest cryoprotective agents (CPAs) are glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide.24 Cryoprotective agents are able to prevent solution effect injury. Their mode of action is probably 2-fold. First, they act as solvents for the salt, thus reducing the salt concentration that the cells are subjected to at the high subzero temperatures (where solution effects are most damaging). In addition, their presence within the cells prevents excessive shrinkage of the cells during this cooling phase.25 Therefore, in the presence of CPAs, it is possible to use very slow cooling rates that minimize intracellular ice formation while protecting the cells against solution effects. High viabilities of all cell types can thus be achieved using this slow cooling rate. For many tissues, the optimum cooling rate is around \u22121\u00b0C per minute when CPAs are used.",

            "text": "The principle for all methods of long-term preservation is to avoid the degradative changes that may occur in the presence of water. These include microbial growth that not only would pose an infection risk but also would result in damage to the matrix. Enzymatic degradation from enzymes released from the skin cells or bacteria could cause significant damage.39 Oxidation reactions may occur; for example, lipid peroxidation is a chain reaction that results in rancidity of fats and toxicity in bone.40 Hydrolytic reactions can also damage matrix components. All of these detrimental reactions are dependent on water being present (Fig. 2\n). Therefore, the removal, immobilization, or sequestration of water is the basis for long-term preservation of tissue grafts. This can be achieved in 3 main ways:1.\nDeep freezing. At the freezing point of the tissue, ice nucleation occurs. As the temperature falls further, ice crystals form and existing crystals grow. Ice crystals are pure water and hence the remaining solution becomes progressively concentrated. Eventually, the point is reached at which there is too little free water left in solution to facilitate the microbial growth and the degradative chemical reactions. At this temperature, long-term preservation is achieved. In practice, storage in a \u221280\u00b0C deep freeze has proved satisfactory for long-term storage.2.\nFreeze drying. This process involves the removal of water from skin in the frozen state by sublimation, which is achieved by applying a vacuum to the tissue and condensing the removed water molecules downstream.25 Sublimation from the frozen state helps to protect molecules that would otherwise be adversely affected by high salt concentrations at higher temperatures, for example, denaturation of proteins. Drying must continue until enough water has been removed to prevent degradation reactions, which equates to less than 5% residual water as measured gravimetrically. Although accepted in most tissue banking standards, \u201cresidual water\u201d is not identical to \u201cwater activity,\u201d which is the most appropriate measure.41\nThe US Navy Tissue Bank was the first to commence large-scale freeze drying of human tissues for implantation in the early 1950s. In 1955, the use of freeze-dried skin was first reported. It was subsequently shown that freeze drying reduced the immunogenicity of skin42 without interfering with its beneficial properties.31, 32, 43, 44\n3.\nUse of high-concentration solutes. High concentrations of salts or sugars have been used for centuries for the long-term preservation of food items. The principle here is that each solute molecule is able to sequester water molecules in a hydration shell around the molecule. The water within the hydration shell is almost crystalline in nature and is unable to participate in other chemical reactions. The Euroskin Bank developed a solute preservation method using glycerol.45 The skin was incubated in successively more concentrated glycerol solutions (50%, 70%, and 85%) and maintained long term in 85% glycerol. More recently, the glycerol and water flux kinetics have been characterized and a more efficient validated protocol was proposed.46 The water activity of skin in different glycerol concentrations has been measured using a commercially available instrument.41 This study demonstrated that the 85% concentration originally chosen by the Euroskin Bank is optimal for minimizing degradative reactions.\n",

This is the sterilization dose required to reduce the microbial density by 1 log10 (90%) (Fig. 4\n). Where the line crosses the x-axis indicates there is an average of less than 1 viable organism per item being sterilized. Again, this is a statistical phenomenon so that when 10\u22121 is reached, this indicates 1 viable microbe for every 10 items being treated. The Food and Drug Administration has recently indicated that to claim sterility of a banked tissue product, enough sterilization dose should be applied to reach the 10\u22126 level, that is, 1 viable microbe per 1 million tissue items sterilized. Because it is not possible to destructively culture 1 million tissue grafts, the value is obtained by extrapolation of the line in Fig. 5\nto the 10\u22126 level using the D value concept. This is referred to as the 10\u22126 sterility assurance level (SAL). To reach the 10\u22126 SAL level from the x-axis clearly requires 6 D values. Additional D values, however, are required to move from the original bioburden to the x-axis. If the initial bioburden is low, for example, only 10 microbes per graft, then log10 of 10 = 1, that is, 1 additional D value is required, giving a total of 7 to reach a SAL of 10\u22126. If, on the other hand, there are 1 million microbes per graft, then log10 of 106 = 6, that is, 6 additional D values are required, giving a total of 12.",
