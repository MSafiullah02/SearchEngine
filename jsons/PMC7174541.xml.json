The mortality appears to be around 2%; early published data indicate 25.9% with COVID-19 pneumonia required intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 20.1% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1, 2]. Non-invasive support methods (i.e., CPAP, BiPAP, NIV, HFNO) might correct hypoxemia and avoid endotracheal intubation but may either delay intubation with potential complications. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) via an endotracheal tube (ETT) is being commonly employed during this outbreak.",

We have been always performing trans-isthmus tracheostomy with tracheal-to-skin stitches on inferior margin without ETT removal to avoid accidental displacement of tracheal cannula. Cuffed non-fenestrated cannula should be used to limit diffusion of the virus. Every effort should be made not to pierce the cuff of the ETT when performing tracheostomy. Initial advancement of the ETT should be performed prior to tracheostomy window being made. Ventilation has to cease prior to tracheostomy tube insertion, which has to be swift and accurate with prompt inflation of the cuff. Most skilled ENT surgeon should perform the procedure due to the uncomfortable setting of the ICU COVID-19 room and personal protective equipment.",
