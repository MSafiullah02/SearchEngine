One pig served as an environmental sentinel, i.e., was in the room throughout the time treatments were administered, but was not intentionally exposed to PRRSV. Following treatment, pigs were housed individually to preclude transmission among animals. Serum samples collected at 0, 5, and 10 days post inoculation were assayed for the presence of PRRSV by virus isolation (VI) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to determine whether the exposure resulted in infection.

The probability of infection after aerosol exposure was modeled on the proportion of pigs that became infected by dose. For this application, both logit (log-logistic) and probit (log-normal) models were considered plausible models. The logit model was represented as ln(P/1 \u2212 \nP), where P represents the probability that an individual chosen at random will become infected for a given dose \u201cx\u201d. P may be obtained from the logistic function P\n = [1 + exp(\u2212\u03b1\n \u2212 \n\u03b2x)\u22121, \u2212\u221e < \nx\n < \u221elogit \nP was estimated from the linear function logit P\n = \n\u03b1\n + \n\u03b2x (Govindarajulu, 2001). In the probit model, P was obtained from the distribution function of the normal distribution (\u03a6), whereP=(2\u03c0)\u22121/2\u222b\u2212\u221e\u03b1+\u03b2xexp(\u2212u2/2)du, \u2212\u221e<x<\u221e\n",

Historically, most transmission experiments in aerobiology have focused on testing whether the pathogen of interest could be transmitted via aerosol, i.e., sentinel animals became infected by exposure or not. A variety of experimental designs have been used to that end, but most have failed to provide for an estimate of the exposure dose. In addition, this \u201canimal in a box\u201d approach usually fails to take into account a variety of factors that affects exposure doses, e.g., differences in excretion rates of infected donor animals (Alexandersen et al., 2003), respiratory tidal volumes of the host animal (Alexandersen et al., 2002), sedimentation and/or dilution rates of airborne particles (Morawska, 2006), rate of airborne pathogen inactivation (Hermann et al., 2007), and air sampling methods which produce inconsistent estimates of pathogen concentration (Bourgueil et al., 1992). Consequently, descriptive transmission experiments are difficult to interpret or apply to the field. Thus the objective of this paper was to describe an improved methodology for calculating the probability that a dose of airborne pathogen will result in animal infection. To accurately calculate exposure dose, the volume of air respired by the animal during the exposure period is measured and multiplied by the concentration of aerosolized pathogen per unit of air. The method described applies several solutions to the problem of arriving at a precise estimate of exposure dose.",

Rotation of the DAT, typically 3\u20135 revolutions per minute (rpm), reduces the rate of pathogen-contaminated droplet loss through sedimentation (Goldberg et al., 1958, Songer, 1967, Sattar et al., 1987). Although particle suspension is maximized, physical loss of airborne pathogen within the DAT over time must be monitored in order to differentiate inactivation of infectious pathogen from sedimentation of particles. Depending on the pathogen, this can be done by testing samples collected at uniform intervals using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Alternatively, an inert dye, e.g., Rhodamine B, can be incorporated into the suspension fluid containing the pathogen at the time of aerosolization. The decline in the concentration of pathogen or dye in the air within the DAT reflects physical sedimentation (Hermann et al., 2007). Pathogen infectivity can be preserved by maintaining the DAT at a temperature appropriate for pathogen stability. For example, in this study PRRSV virus infectivity was preserved by holding the DAT at \u221219 \u00b0C (Hermann et al., 2007).",

The result is expressed in terms of quantity of infectious pathogen per volume of air within the DAT. To quantify concentration of PRRSV within the DAT, air samples were taken using a validated sampling procedure (Hermann et al., 2006). The collection fluid was then assayed for infectious pathogen using a quantitative infectivity assay and real time RT-PCR. A further benefit of taking sequential samples is that estimates of virus concentration can be calculated using linear regression analysis (qRT-PCR genomic copies per ml vs. TCID50 per ml) when the concentration of infectious virus is below the threshold of detection.",
