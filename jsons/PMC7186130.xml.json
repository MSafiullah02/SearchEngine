This model, like that previous model, is applicable to a variety of emerging and re-emerging pathogens exhibiting an observable latent period as well as symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. The specificity of the present model is the further incorporation of Erlang distributions of the time of sojourn in some of the important compartments in the model. Indeed, most of the work we have carried out so far on COVID-19 has concerned predictions over a short time period, often no more than a month. In this context, incorporating a better description of sojourn times is extremely important. The present model generalises the simple 3-compartment SIR model to age of infection models, providing a reasonable approximation to the details of progression through infection with a minimal number of parameters and the convenience of an ODE model over integral or PDE models.",

The SLIAR epidemic model has often been used to describe the propagation of diseases caused by virus leading to respiratory illness such as influenza (Jin et al., 2011; Kim, Lee, & Jung, 2017; Li et al., 2020). Contrary to SLIR (or SEIR) models, it allows to consider infection by asymptomatic individuals, which in the case of COVID-19 has been reported to have substantially contributed to disease propagation (Li et al., 2020).",

Furthermore, because the time horizon for simulations is very short in comparison to reported estimates of incubation period (Backer, Klinkenberg, & Wallinga, 2020; Lauer et al., 2020a) and communicable period (Hu et al., 2020), making a more appropriate description of sojourn times in the incubation, symptomatically infectious and asymptomatically infectious compartments is important. Although not ideal, we use an Erlang distribution, i.e., a Gamma distribution with integer shape parameter. To simplify the problem, we use two compartments for each of the L, I and A states (Arino, 2020). We could use more if need be; the overall set up would vary very little.",

A wide range of possible duration have been reported. Let us suppose, for instance, that the mean incubation period of COVID-19 is 5.2 days as reported by (Lauer et al., 2020b). Then, comparing the fraction of individuals infected at time 0 and still incubating at time t, we obtain Fig. 1\n. The Erlang distribution thus allows both a less pronounced early end and a less extended duration of the incubation period. If need be, we could further extend this behaviour by adding more compartments and thus increasing the shape parameter of the Erlang distribution.",

This is decided using the basic reproduction number R0. To find its value, we use the method in (Arino et al., 2007), using the notation therein. First, D=1 since S\u2208Rm with m=1. The matrix \u03a0=[pij] (to avoid confusion with the fraction \u03c0 of asymptomatic cases) has entry pij the fraction of the jth susceptible compartment moving, upon infection, to the ith infected compartment.

It takes the form b=(0,\u03b7,1,1,\u03be,\u03be). The function denoted \u03b2(x,y,z) in (Arino et al., 2007) is f(x) here.

Because of the number of compartments, the peak here can be studied in two parts. Before the peak is actually reached, there is first a point in time at which incidence starts to decrease; this is sometimes called the turning point of the epidemic. In the present model, this point is reached when L1'=0, i.e., with mass action incidence, when(7)S=\u03b5L1\u03b2(\u03b7L2+I1+I2+\u03be(A1+A2))=:\u03a8(I),where I=(L1,L2,I1,I2,A1,A2). Note that \u03a8 is not defined everywhere in phase space; for instance, it is not defined at E0 nor if one considers an I with sign pattern (+,0,0,0,0,0). However, past initial transients and before I becomes close to E0, (7) provides a characterisation of the phase the epidemic is currently in. If S>\u03a8(I), then the \u201cnatural tendency\u201d of the epidemic is to propagate more. When enough susceptible individuals have been \u201cconsumed\u201d by the infection, i.e., when S<\u03a8(I), the epidemic cannot sustain itself anymore. For perspective, in the context of COVID-19 and using time units of days and mass action incidence, \u03b5 is of the order of 10\u22121 while \u03b2 is typically several order of magnitude smaller, so the factor \u03b5/\u03b2 in (7) is in the range [104,107].
