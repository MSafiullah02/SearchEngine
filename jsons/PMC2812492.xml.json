            "text": "Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have a wide range of host species, including humans, pigs, horses, wild mammals, and birds. Their classification relies on two antigenic surface proteins, the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA) for which 16 and 9 different subtypes are known, respectively. Because many combinations of HA and NA have been found in wild waterfowl and the prevalence in these species is high worldwide, they are considered the natural reservoir of IAVs [1]. Prevalence is particularly high in dabbling ducks (i.e. ducks that feed by tipping into the water to graze on aquatic vegetation or feed on small aquatic preys), probably because their feeding behavior favors ingestion of viral particles. In ducks, IAVs usually replicate in the epithelial cells of the intestinal tract and are excreted at high concentrations from the cloaca into water [2]\u2013[4]. The main transmission route in waterfowl is oro-fecal [5] but indirect contamination by ingestion of contaminated water may also play a role in yearly infection dynamics [6]. The peak of IAV isolation occurs during or just prior to the autumn migration, a time when many immunologically na\u00efve juveniles share water with adult birds from different breeding areas [1], [7].",

First, low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) strains of the H5 and H7 subtypes, which are known to circulate in wild birds, may become highly pathogenic (HPAI) if introduced into poultry and cause high morbidity and mortality with severe economic consequences [1]. Second, wild birds represent a reservoir of IAVs that may reassort with human viruses in pigs or other so-called \u201cmixing vessel\u201d hosts and ultimately generate strains with pandemic potential [8]. Finally, it has been suggested that wild birds might be involved in the spread and transmission to humans of IAV strains with direct zoonotic potential [9].",

            "text": "Influenza A virus transmission dynamics in waterfowl may vary depending on whether (1) hosts are affected by infection and (2) herd immunity exists in the population [10]. These two questions were addressed by using an experimental infection approach. The wild type mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) was chosen as an experimental model because it is the most widespread and abundant migratory dabbling duck from which IAVs are frequently isolated both in Eurasia and North America [11], [12]. Previous experimental infection studies on mallards or closely related domestic ducks (i.e. Pekin ducks, Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) revealed that infection by IAVs generally does not adversely affect this natural host [3], [4], [13]\u2013[18]. However, a recent field study found a lower body mass in mallards positive for IAV compared to negative mallards [19] indicating that there might be an ecological cost of infection despite the absence of obvious clinical signs. Previous successive experimental studies reported the existence of a relative protection against HA homologous [3], [18] and heterologous [18] re-infections.",

Six juvenile male mallards caged individually and continuously monitored by telemetry for body temperature, heart rate, and activity, were successively inoculated with an H7N7 LPAI isolate (day 0), the same H7N7 virus again (day 21) and an H5N2 LPAI isolate (day 35) (Figure 1).

In mallards, HI antibodies were detected in the bile and peaked at about 12 days PI, i.e. approximately the moment when cloacal shedding ceased [30]. Additionally, cellular immune response was shown to play a role in the protection of chickens [31] and turkeys [32] against heterologous infections and may be important in the protection of ducks [29], [33].

To prevent infection of the wounds, a long-lasting antibiotic (amoxicillin LA, Vetrimoxin\u00ae, 15 mg/kg) was injected in the pectoral muscle both after surgery and two days later.

The second period (3 weeks) aimed at studying the effects of primo-infection with an H7N7 LPAIV strain inoculated in the esophagus (108.7 EID50 in a 1 mL inoculum).
