The wood was usually riddled with empty teredinid burrows and the nemerteans, when revealed, attempted to escape along these by using their proboscis as a locomotory organ. This type of rapid movement, a specialized form of escape response, has been observed in a few terrestrial and freshwater species (Dendy, 1892a; Pantin, 1950; Hickman, 1963; Moore & Gibson, 1973 These brackish water nemerteans appear to be intolerant of higher salinities. Individuals left overnight in tanks of clean aerated sea-water had by the morning emerged to crawl around benches and other laboratory furniture. Their tracks could be followed by a dried slime trail, similar in appearance to those left by terrestrial molluscs, flatworms and nemerteans; the worms appear capable of surviving at least for several hours out of water.",

The longitudinal muscles are strongly developed (see also Fig. 3) : anteriorly, just behind the brain, cephalic gland lobules separate an inner layer of longitudinal fibres (Fig. 2 ) (forming the origin of the pre-cerebral septum) from an outer layer which gives rise to the cephalic retractor muscles.

Its stylets, at 200-250 pm long among the largest ever recorded for any nemertean, are capable of penetrating the soft human flesh between fingers; a wound so inflicted produces a sharp stinging sensation which wears off after a few minutes.

The posterior stomach is typically hoplonemertean, with strongly ciliated, deeply folded walls containing basophilic gland cells, and is very large (Figs 2, 3) . It is ensheathed by longitudinal splanchnic muscle fibres. A long wide pyloric duct, overlying a ventral intestinal caecum, leads from the stomach into the intestine, which bears unbranched lateral diverticula throughout its length. A pair of anterior caecal diverticula (Fig. 3 ) extend forward to just below the dorsal brain lobes. The cephalic glands are extensive, reaching from the anterior tip to well behind the brain (Fig. 3) . A characteristic feature of the glands in Mallory stained sections is that the typical vacuolated basophilic lobules are both surrounded and invaded by coarsely granular orange-staining tissues, usually situated peripherally (Plates I(a), 11). The basophilic glandular components stain strongly both with the Alcian blue method for acid mucopolysaccharides and the periodic acid-Schiff carbohydrate technique; in contrast the orange-staining granular tissue reacts to neither of these stains but is coloured by the bromphenol blue method for proteins.",

In Pantinonemertes gen. nov., however, the flame cells are binucleate and reinforced with irregularly arranged transverse bars, having an identical and unique appearance in all three species (Plate lIl(b), (g)). Binucleate and reinforced flame cells also occur in the Pelaensis or lndopacific group of Geonemertes, but here the transverse bars are more regularly arranged and joined by longitudinal supports to give a \"bivalve\" appearance (Plate Tll(h)).",

One such evolutionary sequence was postulated by Pantin (1961b) to relate the upper littoral form Acteonemertes to New Zealand land nemerteans. His theory is reinforced by the occurrence of a fully terrestrial colour variety of Acteonemertes on the remote Auckland Islands (Moore, 1973) .
