From September 2009 to January 2010, a total of 17 patients with confi rmed H1N1 infection were included in the study (mean age 30.7 years). All patients were managed as outpatients or required short hospitalization without ventilation assistance. The CT scans were assessed for the presence of nodules, ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, bronchial wall thickening, reticulation, effusion, and lymph node enlargement. Location and distribution were evaluated. Results. The most frequent manifestation was a mixture of nodules, consolidation, and GGO (5/17, 29.4%). In one case there was a focal area of bronchiolitis (centrilobular nodules with tree-in-bud appearance), and 10 of 17 cases (58.8%) showed bronchial wall thickening (fi ndings of bronchitis/peribronchitis) and/or other abnormalities. In 16 of the 17 cases (94.1%) there were CT abnormalities with bilateral and random distribution without zonal predominance. Pleural effusions were seen in eight cases (47.1%). Conclusion. In contrast to several reports so far, CT fi ndings of H1N1 virus infection in patients with mild illness are variable, including suggestive fi ndings of infl ammation involving large and/or small airways. This study showed various CT fi ndings overlapping with other viral, atypical, or bacterial pneumonia and even cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.",

This pandemic infl uenza A (H1N1) caused increased morbidity and mortality in a young population who were not generally at risk for severe illness with the usual seasonal infl uenza. 1, 2 To date, many reports have described the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of this 2009 H1N1 infection in many countries. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] There have been only a few reports reviewing the radiological features of 2009 H1N1 infection [6] [7] [8] [9] ; and in those studies, most computed tomography (CT) examinations were in patients who had a severe clinical course. So far, frequently reported radiographic and CT fi ndings of H1N1 infection were focal or multifocal patchy consolidations and ground-glass opacities, resembling organizing pneumonia. In severe cases, those abnormalities progressed to extensive airspace disease, and the radio-graphic fi ndings somewhat resembled those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).",

[6] [7] [8] The similarity of radiological fi ndings in H1N1 infection and SARS has been raised. 10 A few published articles showed imaging appearances somewhat similar to those of SARS and revealed the absence of small airway Fig. 3 . Case 3, a 17-year-old boy. a Initial thin-section CT scan shows multifocal bronchial wall thickening with subtle GGO in the peribronchial area in both lower lobes. b Axial image at the level of the bronchus intermedius reveals pneumomediastinum and interstitial emphysema along the left upper lobe bronchus as a concomitant complication. Bronchial wall thickening is seen in both lower lobe superior segments, and focal consolidation and interlobular septal thickening are noted in the right upper lobe. c Follow-up thin-section CT scan obtained 7 days after that in a shows signifi cant resolution of bronchial wall thickening in both lower lobes. Poorly defi ned nodules or subtle GGO remain in the right lower lobe isolated BWT (1/17, 5.9%). One case showed multifocal patchy opacities with central GGO and peripheral consolidation, appearing with a reversed halo sign, which has been described as one of the CT fi ndings of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (1/17, 5.9%) (Fig. 4) . The CT fi ndings of six patients <18 years of age in our study were also nonspecifi c and overlapped with fi ndings in adults. The anatomical distributions of these abnormalities were bilateral and random without zonal predominance in 16 of 17 cases (94.1%) (Fig. 4) . One patient had unilateral diffuse parenchymal involvement (1/17, 5.9%) (Fig. 5) . Two patients (cases 2, 3) had pneumomediastinum and pulmonary interstitial emphysema as complications of pulmonary infection (Fig. 3b) . Pleural effusions were seen in 8 of 17 cases (47.1%, unilateral in 5 and bilateral in 3 patients) although the amount was disease. [6] [7] [8] It is diffi cult to explain the lack of fi ndings of small airway disease\u23afsuch as centrilobular nodules, tree-in-bud opacities, mosaic attenuation\u23afin SARS and H1N1 infection. Two explanations are possible: Small airway disease develops early in the course of H1N1 infection and then either diminishes or progresses to a different pattern of abnormality; and CT is usually performed in more severely affected patients. 3, 11 Agarwal et al. 6 reported a high risk for pulmonary embolism (36%) in patients with severe illness. Although all 17 CT collections in our study were not performed with embolism protocol, pulmonary embolism in larger arteries was not detected in 15 cases with contrastenhanced CT scans performed on a 64-or 16-MDCT scanner.",

The CT fi ndings of 6 patients under the age of 18 years in our study were also nonspecifi c and overlapped with fi ndings in adults. BWT was frequently seen in both pediatric and adult patients. Viral infections of the lower respiratory tract generally are infections of the bronchial epithelium and peribronchial interstitial tissue, and they result in thickening of the bronchial wall, mucosa, and peribronchial tissue (termed bronchitis/ peribronchitis).

We presume that it is the result of the spread of infl ammation from the peribronchial axial interstitium to the peripheral interstitium.
