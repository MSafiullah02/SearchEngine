Other human coronaviruses generally cause mild respiratory infections (eg, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1). MERS-CoV, like SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, can cause highly lethal disease in humans. MERS-CoV is a large single-strand positive-sense RNA virus (figure 1\n).14, 15, 16, 17, 18 The 30\u201331 kb coronavirus genome encodes a large number of proteins, which might confer versatility in adapting to new environments and enhance cross-species transmission. MERS-CoV has four structural proteins: spike (S) protein, envelope (E)protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. The S protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein located as a trimer on the virus surface and consists of S1 and S2 subunits. It has crucial roles in binding, fusion, and entry into host cells. The S1 subunit has a receptor binding domain that binds to the host cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). The S2 subunit has two regions, heptad repeats 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2), which rearrange to form a six-helix bundle to enable membrane fusion. The E and M proteins are present in the viral membranes and are required for viral assembly, budding, and intracellular trafficking.",

Dromedary camels are a host reservoir species for the MERS-CoV (appendix pp 3\u20135).20, 21, 22, 23 Humans can acquire MERS-CoV through direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels or infected patients19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 (figure 4A\n). However not all cases infected in the community report contact with dromedary camels (appendix p 4\u20135). The transmission of MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans is now well documented in the Arabian Peninsula,23, 24, 25 but the extent to which this transmission is occurring in countries outside the Arabian Peninsula requires definition. Experimental infections have shown that infected dromedaries shed MERS-CoV from their nasal secretions with minimal signs of illness, which is limited to rhinorrhoea.27, 28, 29 Full-genome phylogenetic analysis indicates that evolution of diverse MERS-CoV lineages in camels have caused human infections, perpetuating a low barrier for interspecies transmission.21, 29, 30 However, African MERS-CoV lineages in camels imported into Saudi Arabia have not established themselves in camels in Saudi Arabia,9, 30 indicating potential differences in transmission dynamics and selection pressure. Analysis of population dynamics shows that Arabian viruses can maintain endemicity without introduction of additional lineages.9, 30 WHO is supporting molecular and serological studies at the dromedary\u2013human interface in several countries in Africa and south Asia.31 The phylogenetic relationship of complete genomes of MERS-CoV strains obtained from camels and humans has been published.32\n",

After infection of mice transgenic for the expression of the host DPP4 receptor, histological examination showed MERS-CoV enteric infection in all inoculated mice with progression to infection of the lung tissues, indicating the development of sequential respiratory infection.39\nPanel 1Risk factors for MERS-CoV infection, transmission, and outbreaks21,34,38,132\u2013138\nCommunity risk factors\n\n\u2022Indirect or direct contact with MERS-CoV-infected camels, camel nasal secretions, milk, urine, faeces, meat, or birthing products\u2022Travel to the Middle East and contact with camels or attendance at a health facility\u2022Exposure to, or contact with, patients with MERS-CoV in the community, or at healthcare facilities\u2022Underlying chronic medical conditions\n\nNosocomial risk factors for human-to-human transmission and outbreak amplification\n\n\u2022Late diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection\u2022Lack of awareness in health-care workers of the possibility of MERS in patients with a fever\u2022Overcrowded or contaminated health-care facilities, especially emergency departments, dialysis units, and crowded inpatient wards\u2022Exposure of hospital staff or other patients to symptomatic patients with MERS\u2022Delayed implementation of infection control measures\u2022Poor compliance with MERS-specific infection control guidelines (hand hygiene, droplet and contact precautions, environmental cleaning)\u2022Poor compliance with appropriate personal protective equipment when assessing patients with febrile respiratory illness\u2022Aerosol-generating procedures or invasive procedures in patients with MERS (eg, nebulisers, resuscitation, intubation, and ventilation)\u2022Lack of proper isolation room facilities\u2022Distance between patient beds of less than 1 m\u2022Friends and family members staying as caregivers in overcrowded health-care facilities\nMERS=Middle East respiratory syndrome.

The 2013 outbreak in Al Hasa, Saudi Arabia, involved 23 people in three different hospitals and was linked to poor infection control practices, aerosol-generating procedures, continuous positive pressure ventilation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.42 In June, 2017, an outbreak of 34 MERS-CoV cases (including 17 in health-care workers) occurred in a hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,43 where the primary case was a 47-year-old man admitted for emergency intubation. Before a diagnosis of MERS, this individual had contact with 220 health-care workers, patients, and visitors. Another 2017 outbreak in Riyadh involved three hospitals, with 44 MERS cases in patients, health-care workers, and family members. The outbreak arose from three severely ill people who were diagnosed with MERS late in the disease course, and involved in a superspreading event.44 In 2015, South Korea had the largest MERS-CoV outbreak outside the Middle East with 186 cases reported, resulting from a single imported case from an individual who had returned from travelling in the Middle East.

Viral RNA, but not infectious MERS-CoV, was detected in the blood for at least 2 weeks after diagnosis. Whether this viral RNA represented an extrapulmonary infection is not clear, since MERS-CoV neutralising antibody was detected in the serum at the same time in some patients.49\n",

In patients with SARS, innate immune responses characterised by an extended period of cytokine secretion (eg, IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2) was correlated with delayed antibody responses and poor management outcomes; this prolonged innate response has not yet been shown in patients infected with MERS-CoV.53 MERS-CoV productively infects activated human T cells and induces delayed cytokine responses after infection of human myeloid cells in vitro, both of which could impair virus clearance and the development of an effective immune response.54, 55, 56\n",

Preclinical animal data show that transfer of serum samples from MERS-CoV-immune camels to infected mice resulted in reduced weight loss and lung histopathology,106 thus suggesting therapeutic potential. In the 2015 Korean outbreak, three of 13 patients with MERS with respiratory failure were given four infusions of convalescent plasma.107 Two of three showed neutralising activity. Donor plasma with a plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) titre of 1/80 had a meaningful serological response after convalescent plasma infusion, while that with a PRNT titre of 1/40 did not. The authors conclude that for effective convalescent plasma infusion in patients with MERS, donor plasma with a neutralisation activity of a PRNT titre greater than or equal to 1/80 should be used.",

            "text": "Figure 1: MERS-CoV structure, genome organisation, and replication MERS-CoV encodes a large replicase-transcriptase polyprotein (rep1A and rep1B), which is processed into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp). These proteins are required for the formation of the replicase-transcription complex, for cleavage of the polyprotein, and for immune evasion. Structural proteins (spike [S], envelope [E], membrane [M], and nucleocapsid [N]) and accessory proteins (ORFs 3, 4a, 4b, 5, 8b) are encoded in the end third of the 3' end of the genome of the genome. MERS-CoV binds to its cellular receptor DPP4 via the S protein, which is processed by host proteases to expose a fusion peptide. The viral genome is then released into the cytoplasm, where it is translated on host ribosomes into rep1A and rep1B proteins. The polyprotein is cleaved by two viral-encoded proteases, encoded by nsp3 and nsp5. Proteins involved in genome and subgenome replication and transcription include nsp12 (the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRP]) and two associated proteins, nsp7 and nsp8.127 Nsp13 (a helicase), nsp14 (which encodes an N7 methyltransferase and ExoN, a protein required for genome fidelity), and nsp16 (a 2'-O methyltransferase) are also necessary for optimal genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis. MERS-CoV transcription involves the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs, which encode the structural and accessory proteins located at the 3' end of the genome. Subgenomic and genomic RNAs are co-terminal, sharing the same 5' leader and 3' sequences. Subgenomic RNAs code for structural and accessory proteins (ORF3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 8b). ORF8b is encoded within the N gene (marked with purple lines). These accessory proteins are believed to have immunoevasive properties, but are not essential for replication, and are variably deleted in human and camel virus isolates.128, 129, 130 Genomic replication occurs on membrane structures such as double membrane vesicles (DMVs), convoluted membranes (CM), and vesicle packets (VP), which are merged DMV131 that have been formed from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) by the combined action of nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 (lower right). After synthesis on replicase-transcription complexes, RNA is encapsidated by the N protein and transported to the ERGIC (endoplasmic reticulum\u2013Golgi compartment), where budding into membranes containing the S, E, and M proteins occurs before release from the cell. 3CLPro=chymotrypsin-like protease.
