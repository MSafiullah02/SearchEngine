As of March 4, 2019, a total of 80,409 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, and a total of 3,012 patients among those confirmed cases died, corresponding to a mortality rate of 3.7% (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/; accessed March 5, 2020) . At the writing of this article on March 5, 2020, it appears that the momentum of the epidemic in mainland China, especially that in the epicenter of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, has slowed down. However, the disease is gaining momentum outside of China, and it could ultimately become very severe (https://www.who. int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/eventsas-they-happen; accessed March 5, 2020). The concern is whether the COVID-19 epidemic could become a oncein-a-century pandemic. 2 It did not take more than a few days before the healthcare system and providers in the epicenter of Wuhan were stunned by the COVID-19 outbreak's scale, speed, severity, and serious threat to healthcare providers themselves. Many patients developed serious symptoms, with some of them becoming critically ill. 1 The hospitals were quickly overwhelmed, forcing the administration to lock down the city of Wuhan, reactivate the workforce a few days ahead of the most popular holiday in China, Lunar New Year, reorganize the case flow, convert noninfectious floors and hospitals into infectious ones, build two new hospitals from ground zero, and open 16 Fang Cang hospitals using the big sport, conference, exhibition, and performance buildings ( fig. 1 ; http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/; accessed March 1, 2020). The most common and severe complication in patients with COVID-19 is acute hypoxemic respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring oxygen and ventilation therapies. 3 Some of these critically ill patients required intubation and invasive ventilation. 3, 4 Moreover, although elective surgeries were largely cancelled, emergency surgeries for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 were permitted to proceed.

It can also be a decision that lacks quality evidence for guidance and, thus, is a decision made at the discretion of the treating physician. In patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19, it can be challenging when deciding whether to proceed with intubation and invasive ventilation. The Chinese Society of Anesthesiology Task Force on Airway Management released a fast-track publication with the recommendation to proceed with endotracheal intubation for patients showing no improvement in respiratory distress, tachypnea (respiratory rate greater than 30 per minute), and poor oxygenation (Pao 2 to Fio 2 ratio less than 150 mmHg) after 2-h highflow oxygen therapy or noninvasive ventilation. 9 These criteria should be regarded as empirical as there is no robust supporting evidence. The frontline physicians taking care of critically ill patients in Wuhan suggest that intubation and invasive ventilation may have been adversely delayed in some patients. They are concerned that, amid this particular outbreak, intubation is more often used as a salvage therapy than a proactive means of supporting patients whose oxygenation is progressively declining and oxygen debt keeps increasing.

It is also justified by the observation that some patients are relatively asymptomatic although they have a good degree of hypoxemia for inexplicable reasons (referred to as \"silent hypoxemia\" in Wuhan). 11 Silent hypoxemia may be responsible for the quick deterioration in some patients because it gives a false sense of well-being when the oxygen debt has been actually and asymptomatically increasing.

Equipment that has to be reused is dedicated for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. No glitch or imperfection is minor when there is an associated risk. Preparedness is even more crucial amid the COVID-19 outbreak, as the chance of contamination may be readily enhanced during the process of a complicated intubation when all attention is devoted to saving a patient's life. An experienced practitioner, instead of students or junior personnel, should be assigned to this job. A careful and efficient airway evaluation, whenever possible, should be performed ahead of intubation. Equipment that is used for more than one patient should be cleaned and disinfected before and after each use. The mixture of ethanol and chlorhexidine is recommended as the disinfecting solution for the breathing circuit in China. Two single-use filters (PALL BB50T Breathing Circuit Filter, Pall Corp., USA), placed in the inhalation and exhalation breathing circuits, are used for infection control in Wuhan.

It is well advised to adopt the guidelines established for patients with ARDS, 29, 30 with appropriate modifications based on the firsthand patient care experience in Wuhan (table 5) . This is justified as 67% of the ICU patients developed ARDS based on the recent report. 3 The ARDS lung-protective ventilation guidelines emphasize: (1) a tidal volume less than or equal to 6 ml/ kg predicted body weight; (2) a respiratory rate less than or equal to 35 breaths/min; (3) a plateau airway pressure less than or equal to 30 cm H 2 O; and (4) a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) greater than or equal to 5 cm H 2 O. 31, 32 The tidal volume can be started at 8 ml/kg and then lowered with an ultimate goal of 6 ml/kg. Some clinicians believe that, as long as the plateau pressure can be maintained at less than or equal to 30 cm H 2 O, it may be safe to ventilate the patient with tidal volumes greater than 6 ml/kg predicted body weight. 33 The precise tidal volume for an individual patient should be adjusted according to the patient's plateau pressure, selected PEEP, thoracoabdominal compliance, and breathing effort. 29 It is advantageous to have a driving pressure (plateau pressure minus PEEP) below 12 to 15 cm H 2 O via tidal volume and PEEP adjustments in patients who are not spontaneously breathing. 34 In Wuhan, patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 have a poor tolerance to high PEEP, likely as the result of the direct and severe lung damage by the virus and inflammatory reactions. The plateau pressure reaches 40 to 50 cm H 2 O when the PEEP is set at 18 cm H 2 O, Fio 2 at 100%, and the tidal volume at 6 ml/kg according to the Fio 2 and PEEP table. 32 The widely used practice in Wuhan, after lung recruitment maneuvers, is to set PEEP at 20 cm H 2 O and titrate down in a decrement of 2 to 3 cm H 2 O each time until the goals of oxygenation, plateau pressure, and compliance are all achieved.
