This association enabled public health official to identify the source of human contagion and isolate the causative agent, known now as Nipah virus, a name denoting the location of the case from which the virus was first isolated.6 Infection control measures, including the slaughter and disposal of >1 million pigs, contained the disease; during this outbreak, human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus was not observed.",

In 2001, and again in 2004, Nipah virus encephalitis reemerged, this time in Bangladesh.8 Bats in the region of the Bangladesh outbreaks were found to harbor Nipah virus, suggesting that they again served as the original source of infection; however, in contrast to the Malaysian outbreak, pigs did not participate in the transmission of the virus to humans. Rather, contact with sick humans was strongly associated with contracting Nipah virus encephalitis, and the Nipah virus was isolated from samples of human urine. Now, human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus was occurring.",

The Nipah virus had apparently existed endemically for some time among fruit bats in the remote rainforests of Malaysia and other parts of Asia. In the late 1990s, the bats' natural habitat and food supply were disrupted when millions of acres of rainforest were cleared for human use. Some biologists have theorized that the clearing of the land and the haze caused by the fires used to clear the land forced the bats to search for new sources of food.9 The bats began to colonize the fruit trees planted by humans and fertilized by the pig manure from the farms that had replaced the forests.9 Pigs raised on these farms became infected with Nipah virus and ultimately passed the virus to humans. By infecting and replicating in humans, the virus adapted to a new host, and because humans lacked previous exposure to the virus, Nipah encephalitis, a severe potentially fatal disease, was the outcome.",

Bats worldwide harbor several ancient coronaviruses and appear to serve periodically as the source of human viruses, including the coronavirus causing subacute adult respiratory syndrome.11 Events that facilitate host switching, such as changes in the ecology of potential vectors or modifications in virus genes or proteins, enable viruses to infect and replicate in additional animal species, including humans. Other notable examples of host switching leading to human disease include Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Lyme disease, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, dengue fever, and HIV/AIDS.",

Beginning in the mid-1990s, human outbreaks became more frequent, and fatal cases began to appear in Israel, Algeria, and Romania.13 Mutation of the virus genome leading to enhanced virulence for humans was suspected. In 1999, West Nile virus infections occurred in the United States, marking the initial appearance of the virus in the Western hemisphere. A virus closely related to a West Nile virus strain that had been identified in the Middle East in 1998 caused 7 deaths during an encephalitis outbreak in the New York City metropolitan area.14\n",

Humans serve as the primary source of infection and transmit the parechoviruses in stool, saliva, and respiratory secretions.39 Most infections with parechoviruses occur in young children, and by adulthood, virtually all individuals in many regions possess serological evidence of previous infection.38 Human parechoviruses have been detected in monkey feces, suggesting that monkeys may serve as a zoonotic reservoir.40\n",
