This simple deviation from the standard setup is sufficient to prove that heterogeneity in the dynamical parameters can be as important as the more studied structural heterogeneity. Our analytical solution is able to predict the shift in the critical properties induced by heterogeneous recovery rates. We find that the critical value of infectivity tends to be smaller than the one predicted by quenched mean-field approaches in the homogeneous case and that it can be linked to the variance of the recovery rates. Our findings also illustrate the role of dynamical-structural correlations, where we allow a power-law network to dynamically behave as a homogeneous structure by an appropriate tuning of its recovery rates. Overall, our results demonstrate that heterogeneity in the recovery rates, eventually in all dynamical parameters, is as important as the structural heterogeneity.",

            "text": "Heterogeneity, whether in the nature of the components or the pattern of connections, is a key characteristic of complex systems. This is particularly evident in the case of the spreading of a disease in a networked population, where the inclusion of structural heterogeneity has long been known to radically change the process's critical behavior [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . As an illustration, consider two classical contagion models, the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and the susceptibleinfected-recovered (SIR) models. On a homogeneous network, they both present a nonvanishing critical point [5, 6] . However, the introduction of structural heterogeneity, in the form of broad degree distributions of the nodes, can result in a vanishing critical point [1, [5] [6] [7] . More specifically, in the thermodynamic limit, a divergence of the second moment of the degree distribution [1, 5, 6, 8] or a divergence in the maximum degree [1, 5, 6, 8] implies a vanishing critical infectivity. This in turn has important practical implications for real-world networks, because many of them display very broad [7] [8] [9] (or even scale-free) degree distributions [10] . References [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] considered, in contrast, homogeneous structures but accounted for arbitrary times in the state transitions. Interestingly, previous works studied models characterized by a series of infected states (without a biological interpretation) that described the global behavior accurately [12] [13] [14] [15] 17] . Notably, the model proposed in [12] is general, but each transition has an assigned function, which complicates the model, making its practical use limited. These works encounter, however, a fundamental limitation, because they describe the population at the mean-field level [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . While structural and dynamical heterogeneities are independently accounted for, modeling both types of heterogeneities together has received considerably less attention until recently. Indeed, it was mainly studied for the SIR model: A message-passing formalism was proposed in [19, 20] and a heterogeneous mean-field approach in [21] . In the latter, the authors also performed numerical experiments showing that the population can be more vulnerable in the scenario with dynamical heterogeneity. More recently, this problem was investigated on temporal networks [22] using an SIS process, which was described within the quenched mean-field (QMF) formalism and mainly focusing on spreading rates [23, 24] . A similar approach was considered in [25] , where however the authors highlighted a different aspect, i.e., the allocation of resources during an outbreak.",

Heterogeneous recovery rate distributions can be associated with biological differences between individuals [26, 27] , demographic characteristics [28] , and social differences that result in nonhomogeneous access to the health system [29] . Additionally, we also consider the case in which correlations arise between the structure and dynamics. We show, both analytically and numerically, that such correlations can induce opposing and unexpected dynamical outcomes, for example, power-law (PL) networks displaying nonvanishing critical points and conversely homogeneous networks displaying vanishing critical points. Indeed, we show that the standard QMF predictions, which are a lower bound in the standard scenario, no longer provide such a bound in the heterogeneous rate case. We then propose a simple formulation to overcome this and provide a different lower bound for the process. Our results complement previous evidence on the SIR model [21] and imply that proper characterization of the dynamical parameters is of utmost importance not only for a better understanding of spreading processes, but also for many practical applications, such as surveillance, forecasting, resource management, and network reconstruction, among many others.",

Thus, in the thermodynamic limit, the critical point for PL networks goes to zero if the maximum degree is a growing function of the network size [5, 6, 8] .

In Fig. 1 we present the critical behavior of an ER network for different shapes \u03b1. The top inset emphasizes the behavior of the predicted critical point as a function of \u03b1 and its comparison with estimations from Monte Carlo simulations. As expected, for sufficiently large values of \u03b1, the dynamics behave similarly to the standard SIS model with uniform \u03b4, where the predicted threshold coincides (dashed line in the top inset). The agreement between analytical and simulated critical points is excellent, as it can be seen in the bottom inset of Fig. 1 . Furthermore, as \u03b1 decreases, the variance of \u03b4 and consequently the uncertainty of the bounds are also enlarged. However, we observed that the critical point systematically moved towards zero in our simulations, which is also consistent with Eq. (4). Note that the inverse-gamma distribution is asymmetric with respect to its average and centered at \u03b4 i \u03b4 i . This implies that the bounds in Eq. (4) are also asymmetric. Since the recovery rates are sampled from this distribution, we expect that the number of individuals that take longer to recover is greater than the number of individuals that recover fast. This suggests that, via infection/reinfection mechanisms, the disease can survive for lower values of \u03bb as compared to the standard QMF predictions. In addition to the critical properties, we also show a different supercritical behavior; for example, the low-\u03b1 regime of a network can be similar to, and even in some regions it can be mistaken for, the high-\u03b1 regime on top of a network with a different structure. This multiplicity of supercritical behaviors also raises questions in network reconstruction models based on disease dynamics.",

In the top inset of Fig. 2 (b) we show that the critical point predictions are remarkably good for inverse-gamma recovery rates, even for these real networks. Figures 1 and 2 reveal that the critical point decreases as we increase the variance of the recovery rate distribution. Thus, if we consider heterogeneous networks, assuming an average recovery rate in the QMF is not enough to provide an adequate characterization of the process. It is not a lower bound anymore, as can be seen in Fig. 1 , where the numerically estimated critical point is always slightly lower than the value predicted by the standard QMF predictions (\u03c4 QMF,std c \u2248 0.1).

However, for \u03b3 = 2.1 our results indicate the existence of a vanishing critical point [see Fig. 3 (b) inset]. It seems reasonable to hypothesize that the scenario observed when \u03b3 = 2.1 is due to the fact that, in the steady state, the infection probabilities are inversely proportional to the nodal recovery rates and thus that the evaluation of the recovery time at both ends of every edge enables an infection-reinfection mechanism.

Note that for uncorrelated power laws, this coincides with the different regimes of leading eigenvector localization [37] [for the analysis of the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of the leading eigenvector of Q we refer the reader to Appendix F]. Thus, we conjecture that it may be possible to alter these structural mechanisms with a proper recovery rate distribution, possibly considering dynamics-structure correlations. Note that we implicitly showed [ Fig. 3(a) ] how to transform k-core (\u03b3 = 2.1) and hub-activated (\u03b3 = 2.7, 3.5) mechanisms into a collective behavior phenomenology. Importantly, our findings may lead to alternative prevention/intervention techniques that take advantage of the phenomenology reported here. We also highlight that the consequences of our findings are not limited to the cases explored here. For instance, it is natural to conjecture the existence of Griffith's phase in our setup. In this type of transition, we have an extended critical region instead of a single critical point, which was studied in complex networks in [36, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . More specifically, in [39] the authors showed that slow dynamics on a weighed treelike structure can occur in a contact process.

We showed that dynamical heterogeneity is as significant as structural heterogeneity and that it can induce drastic changes in the SIS critical properties. Furthermore, our results show that the standard QMF approach does not provide a lower bound for the heterogeneous case anymore. To solve this inconsistency, we proposed a solution that relates the structural and dynamical features via the spectral properties of a different matrix Q. This formulation presents opportunities for future research. For example, our findings raise questions about the consequences of heterogeneities in spreading rates and the interplay between spreading and recovery rates. Furthermore, with regard to control/containment strategies, heterogeneity in the recovery rates can be considered for intervention strategies (or even immunization, \u03b4 i \u2192 0). In contrast, heterogeneity of spreading rates would be related to prevention. In this context, our findings might also be of potential interest. In addition to the specific conclusions drawn here, there are others that concern more general aspects of disease spreading processes as well as the characterization of complex systems in general. For instance, differences in the localization properties induced by dynamical heterogeneities might influence the predictability of complex systems, and in particular of diseases [43] , or in the reconstruction of networks from the dynamics as proposed in [44] . Finally, we also stress that our results might also have an impact on information spreading processes since individuals have different activity timescales, which could ultimately be related to the recovery time distribution.

Thus, in the fully delocalized case, IPR \u223c O(N \u22121 ), and in the fully localized case, IPR \u223c O(1). As expected, Fig. 8 shows that in an ER network the IPR scales with \u03bd \u2248 1, \u03bd < 1 for a PL network with \u03b3 = 2.1 [ Fig. 8(a) ], and a PL network with \u03b3 = 3.5 is localized [ Fig. 8(b) ].

It is possible that a network that exhibits full delocalization in the standard case (light pink circles for an ER network in Fig. 8 ) will instead exhibit localization when the recovery rates and structure are correlated (blue triangles in Fig. 8) . Thus, by introducing localization and/or tuning, its scaling exponent \u03bd is not trivial. More specifically, one might naively use the recovery rates as \u03b4 i = k i k PL as a strategy. In this case, k i would delocalize the matrix, while k PL would control the new IPR towards the distribution k PL . To evaluate this strategy, we fixed the structure to an ER network. Next we defined k PL as a PL degree distribution and opted for a discrete approach for k PL , which allowed for a comparison with the localization properties of a network with the same degree distribution, i.e., k PL . However, as we observed in Fig. 8 , this was insufficient to control localization. In the evaluated cases, the resulting matrix Q is localized. Note that k PL \u223c k \u22122.1 is partially delocalized [dark pink squares in Fig. 8(a) ], but its composition with the delocalized structure results in a localized IPR. The case of k PL \u223c k \u22123.5 is less surprising, but also emphasizes the role of heterogeneity in the recovery times in disease localization. Therefore, with this simple strategy, we could not control the localization for an arbitrary \u03bd.",
