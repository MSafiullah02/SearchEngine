(Euphorbiaceae) and assayed for its potential as an anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) agent. The cytotoxicity of 1246TGG on HepG2.2.15 as well as HepG2 cells was determined by observing cytopathic effects, and the effects of 1246TGG on secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg in HepG2.2.15 cells were assayed by enzyme immunoassay. Results indicates that treatment with 1246TGG (6.25 \u00b5g/mL, 3.13 \u00b5g/mL), reduced both HBsAg and HBeAg levels in culture supernatant, yet the inhibitory effects tend to decline with the assay time. This study provides a basis for further investigation of the anti-HBV activity and possible mechanism of action of 1246TGG.",

The diethyl ether layer was partitioned between hexane and methanol, and the methanol layer was further chromatographed successively over Sephadex LH-20, silica gel, MCI-gel CHP 20P and Chromatorex ODS to obtain the desired compound (purity > 95%) in the form of a pale amorphous powder.

Similarly, 3.13\u00b5g/ mL of 1246TGG also decreased the HBeAg and HBsAg level on the 4th and 7th day but without significant differences (P>0.05). However, by the end of the assay, there is was almost no remaining inhibitory effect on antigen secretion. We noticed that HepG2.2.15/HepG2 cells grow rapidly, and during the whole 10 days of treatment, the number of cells in each well increased rapidly, leading to a corresponding increase of HBV DNA production and subsequently, the increase of both HBsAg and HBeAg secretion. It has already been reported that the hepatic uptake of resveratrol, another natural derived polyphenol, occurs by both passive diffusion and facilitated processes[5,6] , and similar processesprobably occur in 1246TGG. Now that the quantity of cells maintained increase during the 10 day period of assay while the drug concentration remained the same, average uptake of 1246TGG into cells might decrease, resulting in the inhibition reduction of HBV antigen secretion. This might explain why the inhibitory effect of 1246TGG at the same concentration declined as time changes. However, the detailed metabolism of 1246TGG in hepatic cells remains to be explored to determine whether the anti-HBV effect of 1246TGG might also be affected by the age of the cell culture. To sum up, in this study, galloyl glucose 1246TGG was isolated and its potential as anti-HBV agent was investigated by measuring the HBsAg and HBeAg levels in HepG2.2.15 cell culture. Our results indicate that 1246TGG could inhibit the secretion of HBV antigen, especially during early period of treatment. However, due to the limitation of HepG2.2.15 cell line as evaluation system for anti-HBV activity of 1246TGG, activities at higher concentrations could not be determined. Besides, further studies are also needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism of anti-HBV activity of 1246TGG and to confirm its potential as a possible therapy for HBV infection in human.",
