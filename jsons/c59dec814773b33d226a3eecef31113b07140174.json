First of all, we classed the global SARS-CoV-2 sequences into four main groups and 10 subgroups based on their different mutation patterns. Next, we found that these groups were markedly different in geography and time. This difference was also observed in age, but not in gender. At last, we systematically characterized the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the world and found two apparently expansions stages of the 10 subgroups with time.

The reason maybe that the sequences of group A and group B1 (emerged before group B2) in USA was not acquired or uploaded. Since group B2 was observed, it quickly became the primary strains in USA and then spread to China, Canada and Australia. Interestingly, when the group B2 emerged in China and Australia, it was almost not expanded. Whereas, in Canada, an adjacent country of USA, it was expanded at once. This hint us the different groups of SARS-CoV-2 may be limited in geography or race.",

Similar with group A and group B1, group C2 was decreased over time, inversely, group C3 was increased step by step. But the dynamic of group C1 was different with the two others, which had a big expansion at Feb-2020. This was because that many SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan was uploaded at Feb-2020. This also was the reason why large compose of group C1 presented in Japan.",

In conclusion, we classed the SARS-CoV-2 into four main groups and 10 subgroups based on different mutation patterns for the first time. The distribution of the 10 subgroups was varied in geography, time and age, but not in gender. After two apparent expansion stages, most of groups are rapidly expanding, especially group D. Therefore, we should pay attention to these genetic diversity patterns of SARS-CoV-2 and take more targeted measures to control its spread.",

Of note, However, the effects of the two new non-synonymous mutations on SARS-CoV-2 were still unclear.Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 is evolving, since its firstly reported in theworld 4,5 . To date, four main groups of mutation patterns of SARS-CoV-2 were identified in this study, based on the 17 high frequency mutations. Group A (included none of the 17 mutations) was the firstly discovered SARS-CoV-2 strain in the world which was emerged in Wuhan, China for the first time since Dec-2019 15 . Group B (contained mutations 8782C>T and 28144T>C) was in accord with Tang at al. discovered S type SARS-CoV-2 strain 4 and GISAID database reported S clade of SARS-CoV-2 strain 16 , respectively. Group C (included mutations 11803G>T or/and 26144G>T) was similar with GISAID database reported V clade of SARS-CoV-2 strain 16 .
