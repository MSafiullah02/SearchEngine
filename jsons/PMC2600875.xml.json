Studies have shown that vaccination of African green monkeys with an attenuated parainfluenza virus encoding SARS-CoV S protein results in the production of SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, protecting vaccinated animals from subsequent SARS-CoV challenge [5]. It is also indicated that the S, among all structural proteins of SARS-CoV, is the only significant neutralization and protective antigen, and that a single mucosal immunization with S protein efficiently suppresses SARS-CoV infection [6]. Furthermore, the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a fragment of S protein, has been demonstrated to be a major neutralization determinant in the development of subunit vaccines against SARS [7], [8]. These reports suggest that S protein of SARS-CoV, especially RBD, is highly effective in prevention of SARS.",

The humoral immune response and IFN-\u03b3 secretion were also enhanced by priming with DNA-based vaccine and boosting with a recombinant adenovirus encoding N protein of SARS-CoV [10].

In this regard, fragments of SARS-CoV S protein are more practical and safer for developing vaccines. It has been shown that the S1 domain, especially the RBD region, is the main fragment and major determinant in eliciting NA against SARS-CoV [7], [8]. In previous studies, we have also demonstrated that candidate vaccines based on the RBD induced high titers of neutralizing antibody and prevented subsequent SARS-CoV challenge in vaccinated mice [11], [15].

DNA vaccines boosted with inactivated virus or viral protein fragments have been shown to improve immune responses, including neutralizing antibody response, against SARS-CoV [9], [25], [26]. It was also reported that the immunization by priming with a DNA plasmid encoding SARS-CoV N protein (pcDNA3.1-N) and boosting with an adenoviral vector expressing the same protein (rAd-N) effectively elicited strong SARS-CoV-N-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in vaccinated mice [27]. In this study, we further demonstrated that the immune responses could be enhanced by priming with RBD-rAAV and boosting with RBD-pep corresponding to the T cell epitopes in the RBD region of SARS-CoV S protein. Compared with the RBD-rAAV prime/boost vaccination, RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-Pep boost induced similar levels of Th1 and neutralizing antibody responses but stronger Th2 and CTL responses (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Like the RBD-rAAV prime/boost vaccination, the RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-pep boost vaccination could also induce potent protective activity in mice against SARS-CoV challenge (Fig. 6). However, no significant immune responses and protective effect were detected in mice vaccinated with RBD-pep or blank AAV alone. These results indicated that RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-Pep boost vaccination can greatly promote cellular immune responses and neutralizing antibody production in the vaccinated mice, which may play important roles in the suppression of SARS-CoV infection in the challenged mice.",

Generally, T cell epitopes are much more conserved than neutralizing antibody epitopes. We have compared amino acid sequences of N50 and N60 peptides, which were used for boost vaccination, between 25 human SARS-CoV strains and 5 civet cat SARS-CoV strains deposited in Genebank. N50 is completely conserved in these strains, and only one strain (Sino1-11) shows a single amino acid change in N60. Thus, the strategy of boosting with T cell peptide may plausibly provide cross-protection against quickly mutated viruses. In this study, both RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-pep boost and RBD-rAAV prime/boost vaccinations provided similar protection against subsequent SARS-CoV challenge, which may be attributed to the neutralizing antibody responses against the challenged virus induced by both strategies. However, the former may probably induce more effective protection against infection by viruses with mutations in the neutralizing epitopes than the latter because the former can elicit significantly stronger specific CTL response than the latter.",

Our present work also demonstrated that the peptide N50 boost vaccination induced much higher level of CD8+ IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells. It has been found that IL-7R\u03b1+ antigen-specific T cells preferentially develop into long-term (effector) memory T cells [32] and effector memory T cells predominantly persist in peripheral sites, the key portals of entry for pathogens [33].
