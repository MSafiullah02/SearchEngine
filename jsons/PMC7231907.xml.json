However, in\n2000, a second ACE, ACE2, was discovered which primarily metabolises Ang II into\nAng-(1\u20139). Ang-(1\u20139) is subsequently converted by neutral endopeptidase and ACE to\nAng-(1\u20137), a vasodilatory peptide. Extensive investigations of ACE2 have revealed that\nit is widely distributed primarily on lung alveolar epithelial cells, small intestinal\nenterocytes and vascular endothelial cells in many organs including liver, kidney and\nbrain,1\nwith multiple additional actions including antiproliferative and antifibrotic effects\nand, more recently, a role of viral receptor and amino acid transporter.2",
