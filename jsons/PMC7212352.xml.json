            "text": "Etoposide, a cytotoxic agent that inhibits topoisomerase II, is widely used across tumor types. The combination of platinum and etoposide chemotherapy has been the front-line therapy for the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) for decades. While the addition of anti-PD-L1 antibodies (atezolizumab, durvalumab) to first-line therapy has improved survival, the platinum plus etoposide backbone remains central to the treatment of this disease (12, 13). Platinum agents (and the anti-PD-L1 antibodies) are delivered intravenously (IV), but etoposide is available in both IV and oral formulations. A prospective phase II trial randomized 83 patients with SCLC to a standard IV regimen (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 IV on day 1 plus etoposide 120 mg/m2 IV days 1\u20133) or a hybrid IV and oral regimen (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 IV on day 1, etoposide 120 mg/m2 IV on day 1 and etoposide 240 mg/m2 orally on days 2 and 3), both in 28-day cycles (14). There was no significant difference in overall response rate (RR) between the oral and IV regimens (50 vs. 59%, p = 0.438). PFS and OS were also comparable in both treatment arms. Most toxicities, including grade 3\u20134 hematologic toxicity, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were similar in both groups. Infectious episodes, moderate to severe anemia, and weight loss occurred more frequently with the IV regimen. Other trials with different dosing schedules for oral etoposide, including 5- or 21-day regimens, also provided comparable outcomes to IV regimens (15, 16).",

A large (n = 436) randomized trial showed superiority of platinum plus etoposide over CEV (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and vincristine) (17). The standard arm utilized oral etoposide (cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1, etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV on day 1 and etoposide 200 mg/m2 orally on days 2\u20134 every 3 weeks) and included 214 patients with limited stage (LS)-SCLC (who received concurrent thoracic radiation therapy). Median survival was longer with platinum plus etoposide (14.5 months) compared to CEV (9.7 months) among patients with LS-SCLC (p = 0.001). For patients with extensive stage (ES)-SCLC, survival was equivalent between the two arms. While the chemo-immunotherapy regimens employing atezolizumab and durvalumab, studied in IMpower133 and CASPIAN, respectively, only used IV etoposide, extrapolation to a hybrid IV-oral regimen could be a reasonable option to reduce infusion center visits and potential COVID-19 exposure (12, 13).",

A phase II trial randomized 189 patients with advanced, treatment-na\u00efve NSCLC in 2:1 fashion to receive oral vinorelbine 60 mg/m2 weekly (with potential escalation to 70 mg/m2 if well-tolerated) or standard IV vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 weekly (33). RR, the primary endpoint, favored the IV arm (13% with IV vinorelbine compared to 4% with oral). TTP was 23.9 weeks with IV vinorelbine and 16.6 weeks with oral vinorelbine. Survival also favored IV delivery with a median OS of 38.6 months in the IV vinorelbine arm vs. 30.3 months in the oral vinorelbine arm. In patients with a good performance status (Karnofsky Performance Status 80\u2013100), outcomes were comparable with a median OS of 38.6 months with IV and 35.6 months with oral. As salvage therapy for NSCLC, oral vinorelbine has limited efficacy. A phase II study explored oral vinorelbine 60 mg/m2 once weekly in 20 patients with previously treated NSCLC (34). Though well-tolerated, there were no objective responses and the median time to progression was limited to 2 months.",

This led to the exploration of oral vinorelbine in special patient populations, where modest efficacy was observed. A single-arm study explored metronomic dosing of oral vinorelbine in 50 patients with advanced NSCLC who were not candidates for standard chemotherapy due to age, performance status, or comorbidities (35). Vinorelbine was given orally at a fixed dose of 30 mg three times a week. The RR was 8% with a median PFS of 2.7 months and a median OS of 7.3 months. Grade 3 adverse events were seen in 11% of patients (anemia, neutropenia, asthenia) with no grade 4 toxicity. In elderly patients, oral vinorelbine was relatively well-tolerated. A phase II study of oral vinorelbine 60 mg/m2 once weekly (with escalation to 80 mg/m2 weekly if well-tolerated) included 56 patients over age 70 with chemotherapy-na\u00efve, advanced NSCLC (36). While grade 4 neutropenia was observed in 30% of patients, neutropenic fever was only seen in 1 patient. The RR was 11% with a median OS of 8.2 months. Another phase II trial included 43 elderly patients (age 70 or greater) with a poor performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 2\u20133) and advanced NSCLC (37). Oral vinorelbine was given at a dose of 60 mg/m2 on days 1\u20138 in 21-day cycles. The schedule was safe with only 1 case of grade 3 neutropenia (which spontaneously recovered) and no febrile neutropenia. There were no other grade 3 or higher adverse events. The RR was 18.6% with a median time to progression of 4 months. Median OS was 8 months with a 1-year survival rate of 37.2%. A more modern study randomized 165 patients with advanced NSCLC who were unfit for platinum-based chemotherapy to receive metronomic oral vinorelbine (50 mg fixed dose three times per week) or oral vinorelbine given 60 mg/m2 weekly (with escalation to 80 mg/m2) (38). The metronomic regimen was better tolerated with fewer adverse events including lower rates of neutropenia (11 vs. 52%) and febrile neutropenia (3.6 vs. 6.2%) with higher relative dose intensity (85 vs. 69%). Median PFS was comparable (4.3 months with metronomic vs. 3.9 months with weekly) as was median OS (7.1 and 7.6 months, respectively). The primary endpoint of PFS without grade 4 toxicity did favor the metronomic schedule.",

This side-effect profile stands in stark contrast to that observed in Japanese patients, who had far less severe GI toxicity. One proposed reason for this difference is the variation in CYP2A6 gene polymorphisms (responsible for tegafur metabolism) among Japanese and Caucasian individuals, which may also play a role in the discrepancy in efficacy reported in these populations (55). Variation in the prevalence of now actionable EGFR driver mutations and the known differences in disease biology may also have factored into the efficacy discrepancy between populations.",

            "text": "In thoracic oncology, capecitabine has thus far demonstrated the most promise when combined with temozolomide (CAPTEM) for the treatment of advanced bronchopulmonary neuroendocrine tumors. The major data in support of this regimen comes from the phase II randomized multicenter ECOG-ACRIN E2211 study in which 144 patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors were randomized to treatment with temozolomide 200 mg/m2 daily on days 1\u20135 (TMZ) or TMZ plus capecitabine 750 mg/m2 twice per day on days 1\u201314 of a 28 day cycle (CAPTEM) (63). CAPTEM demonstrated an improvement in PFS with a median PFS of 22.7 vs. 14.4 months. There was also an improvement in survival (OS HR 0.41, p = 0.012), though the CAPTEM regimen was more toxic with higher rates of grade 3/4 adverse events including neutropenia (13 vs. 4%), nausea/vomiting (8 vs. 0%), diarrhea (8 vs. 0%), and fatigue (8 vs. 1%). While prospective trial data for CAPTEM in bronchopulmonary neuroendocrine tumors are lacking, multiple small single-center retrospective analyses have supported the encouraging data from E2211, demonstrating ORR of 18\u201330%, disease control rates of 76\u201385%, and median OS of 30.4 to 68 months (64, 65). In addition, the toxicity profile of CAPTEM appeared quite favorable in these retrospective studies with the most common grade 3/4 adverse event, thrombocytopenia, occurring in 10\u201315% of patients. While not FDA approved, CAPTEM carries a category 2A NCCN recommendation for the treatment of locoregionally advanced and/or metastatic bronchopulmonary neuroendocrine tumors (66).",

The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a new variable to that equation: the risk of traveling to an infusion center for IV therapeutics. Given this added risk, the risk:benefit ratio for any therapy must be carefully assessed and it is important to recall that in some specific instances, forgoing treatment could be appropriate. For patients who may benefit from therapy, selection of the specific regimen can now be influenced by route of administration and schedule. While most of the standard agents for NSCLC are administered intravenously, there are circumstances where an oral cytotoxic agent may be a comparable alternative and when all else is equal, the ability to receive therapy while staying at home is increasingly appealing in this new era.",
