Their protection against cytopathic viruses before the anti gen-specific immune response is provided by inter feron alpha (IFN \u03b1) secreted by the plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). The systemic analysis of the kinetics of an experi mental coronavirus infection in mice [2] allowed us to estimate the key kinetic parameters for the reaction of activation and synthesis of IFN \u03b1 in response to the coronavirus infection in mouse macrophages and pDCs. In addition, it is predicted that the local con centrations of IFN \u03b1 that provide the antiviral protec tion of macrophages and pDCs are 1 and 45 pg/ml, respectively. However, the empirical analysis cannot provide the information about the particularities of the spatial distribution of interferon in the lymphoid organs in accordance with their structural organiza tion. The only method to study this fundamental aspect of antivirus protection is mathematical simula tion that takes into account the three dimensional architecture of the organs and the diffusion of the humoral factors in their subareas.",

The mac rophages and dendritic cells are located in the regions of the marginal sinus (\u03a9 1 ) under the afferent lym phatic vessels, through which these cells and viruses enter the LN. Then, APCs move to the cortical zone, where they perform their function of induction of antigen specific immune responses. The regions of a LN that contain T lymphocytes (the cortical and para cortical zones or the \u03a9 3 region) are characterized by weak molecular diffusion, which is associated with poor hydraulic conductivity [7] . Taking this into account, we assume that the diffusion coefficient for the \u03a9 3 region is lower by two orders of magnitude than the above mentioned estimation for the \u03a9 1 region. The region of lymphoid follicles (\u03a9 2 ), which contains B lymphocytes, is intermediate in terms of diffusion pro cesses. Therefore, we assume that the diffusion coeffi cient for the \u03a9 2 region is by one order of magnitude smaller than the baseline one. Since IFN \u03b1 has a low molecular weight, the diffusion coefficient in the sys tem of conduits is the same as in the sinusoidal area. The simulation of stationary distribution of IFN \u03b1 created by 10 2 and 10 4 activated pDCs arranged at ran dom, mainly in the upper part of the \u03a9 1 region in the LN is shown in Figs. 2a, 2b . The numerical solution for the model predicts that the variation of concentra tion of IFN-\u03b1 within the LN is two orders of magni tude, i.e., the compartmentalization of the cytokine occurs due to the diffusion. The inner regions of the LN, where the concentration of IFN \u03b1 is close to the threshold concentration of 1 pg/ml with a number of activated pDCs of about 10 4 are shown in Fig. 2c .",

The package includes the following components: the Open CASCADE (http://www.opencascade.org) computer aided design system (CAD); a package of libraries for creation of tetrahedral grids Ani3D [8] ; the program for creating CAD models in Open CASCADE and for building a computational grid; a package of libraries MSTK for operating with multidimensional grids; a program for numerical solution of the stationary reaction diffusion equation [9] ; and the GMV program for data visual ization [4] .",
