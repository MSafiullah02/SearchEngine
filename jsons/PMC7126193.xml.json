The World Health Organization (1999) reports that infectious diseases are the world\u2019s biggest killer of young adults and children, and describes them as a \u201ccrisis of global proportions\u2026 threatening hard-won gains in health and life expectancy.\u201d Every one in two deaths in developing countries is caused by an infectious disease; globally, infectious diseases account for over 13 million deaths every year. In 2000, HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, together, killed 5.7 million people and caused debilitating illnesses in millions more (World Health Organization, 2002). Influenza and pneumonia claim about 250,000\u2013500,000 lives every year globally, and about 36,000 deaths in the US alone (World Health Organization, 2005). In addition to the emergence of new infectious diseases, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS (World Health Organization, 2003), some of the diseases that were once eliminated resurface in populations earlier considered free of the disease. Old infections, such as tuberculosis and diphtheria, have occurred in large epidemics in Europe and other industrialized countries. The 1996 outbreak of polio in Albania, Greece, and the then Federal Republic of Yugoslavia indicates that an infectious disease can easily resurface, if immunization coverage is allowed to drop (World Health Organization, 1999).",

Among a variety of intervention strategies, we focus on vaccination programs in this research, as they are well-known for both their efficiency and cost-effectiveness. In fact, the World Health Organization (2000) considers vaccination to be the \u201cultimate weapon against infection and drug resistance.\u201d For influenza (or flu, more commonly), Germann et al. (2006) argue that vaccination, among other control programs such as social distancing, school closure, and use of antivirals, remains the most effective tool to eliminate the epidemic. They show that even if a flu vaccine is poorly matched to the circulating strains, it can still drastically slow down the spread of the disease.",

Despite this seemingly large size of the global market and the clear benefits of vaccination programs, vaccine uptakes in populations have typically been low (Blue, 2008). Such undesirably low vaccine coverage can be attributed to two main factors:\nSupply-Side Issues: Operational issues on the supply side, such as yield uncertainty, often lead profit-maximizing manufacturers to under-produce, resulting in supply shortages, shortage of influenza vaccines being a prime example. In fact, several papers in the operations management literature argue that the operational risk borne by a manufacturer is one of the main reasons for the shortage of influenza vaccine in the market (Chick et al., 2008, Deo and Corbett, 2009).\nNegative Network Effect: A relatively low vaccine coverage can also arise from the negative network effect faced by consumers. As the fraction of vaccinated individuals grows, the chance of contacting an infection diminishes. Therefore, the willingness to pay for the vaccine reduces, an effect contrary to the positive network effect, in which the willingness to pay for a product increases with the size of the network (Katz and Shapiro, 1985).\n",

On one hand, left to its profit-maximizing ways, a supplier may under-produce, resulting in shortages. On the other, an individual may choose to free ride off the herd immunity, and, consequently, voluntary vaccination may not reach a socially optimal level in the population. We are, therefore, interested in studying the following research questions that arise in this context:\u2022In the face of yield uncertainty and network effects, what is the socially optimal level of vaccine coverage?\u2022Is it possible, from a contract theory perspective, to induce the manufacturer and the consumers to achieve that level?\u2022How does the effectiveness of a vaccine influence the above decisions?\u2022What roles can governments or global non-profit organizations play here in coordinating the market?\n",

Some research in the operations management area has been devoted to the role of supply uncertainty and its effect on the supply chain outcome. For example, Chick et al. (2008) argue that the production risk due to unknown vaccine yields, which is assumed by vaccine manufacturers, is the primary reason for an insufficient supply of influenza vaccine in the market. They design a variant of a cost sharing contract which provides incentives to manufacturers, as well as to governments that purchase vaccines, so that a supply chain achieves an optimal balance between for-profit manufacturer incentives and public health incentives. Deo and Corbett (2009) examine the role of production yield in explaining the limited number of players in the influenza vaccine market. However, these works do not consider the negative network effect and the consumers\u2019 willingness to pay for the vaccine. On the other hand, the demand-side issue has started receiving some attention in more recent literature in operations management. For example, Cho (2010) studies consumers\u2019 willingness to pay, and Arifoglu et al. (2012) address network externality effects in a similar context. However, the objective of these articles are quite different from the current one, as we are concerned with designing contracts to coordinate the vaccine market.",

For example, Bauch and Earn (2004) provide a game-theoretic analysis of vaccine coverage that considers the negative network effect as well as the necessary epidemiological details. They show that a voluntary vaccination program without any government intervention fails to achieve the vaccination level necessary to eliminate the epidemic. Brito et al. (1991) provide a more comprehensive model in their economic analysis of the situation, but lack the necessary epidemiological details. Geoffard and Philipson (1997) also consider vaccine subsidies with the goal of complete eradication of the disease, but do not consider the cost of production and do not discuss an efficient coordination of the vaccine market. They find that a subsidy program would not be effective at achieving eradication because of network externalities. In a more recent article, Althouse et al. (2010) study how public subsidies can help bring the vaccine uptake to a more efficient level in the case of a disease that is subject to network externalities,\n1 but they consider only the consumers\u2014their subsidy is designed to maximize the aggregate consumer utility.

Recently, Mamani et al. (2012) consider the role of governments in market coordination through subsidies in the presence of multiple vaccine manufacturers, but they do not take into account the yield uncertainty inherent in the production process, which, as shown here, has major implications in the subsidy program. In particular, they find that a constant one-part subsidy coordinates the market in a deterministic setting. In extending their results, one would naturally expect that a constant two-part subsidy should align the incentives of different parties under the presence of production uncertainty. Our results, however, indicate that, when the yield is stochastic, a constant two-part subsidy is just not sufficient to align both consumer demand and production quantity with the first-best outcome; rather, a menu of subsidies is necessary. The purpose of this research is to bridge this conspicuous gap in the literature by considering yield uncertainty and network externalities together in order to develop a more comprehensive analysis and to provide a more practical coordination scheme.",

This threshold policy is obtained based on a trade-off: On one hand, retaining the current composition of influenza strains could lead to an ineffective vaccine if new strains were to emerge. On the other, including new strains in the vaccine composition could increase the production yield uncertainty. Arifoglu et al. (2012) combine consumption-side externalities with the supply uncertainty, and show that the limited availability of vaccines lead to an inflated demand. They quantify the level of ineffectiveness of the decentralized model with partially centralized scenarios. In this paper, we, too, combine negative network effects with yield uncertainty to identify the level of inefficiency in a market-based system. However, unlike Arifoglu et al. (2012), we investigate this inefficiency with the lens of contract theory to design incentive mechanisms that can induce consumers and suppliers to make decisions that are aligned with the social optimum.",

(2012); similar to theirs, our model also includes consumers\u2019 free-riding behavior, the production cost borne by the vaccine manufacturer, and a central planner\u2019s desire to achieve the social optimum using subsidy. In addition, however, we also consider the production yield uncertainty faced by the manufacturer. In our model, the yield is stochastic, and hence the vaccine coverage is uncertain. Consequently, the quantity decision is made by the manufacturer under yield uncertainty, whereas the demand decisions are made by consumers facing both the supply uncertainty and the negative network effect. These two decisions are not necessarily aligned with the social objective, and a central planner has a role in aligning them towards the social optimum. This modeling difference has critical consequences on the equilibrium solution, social optimum, and coordination mechanisms. In particular, in (Mamani et al., 2012), where the yield is deterministic, a one-part subsidy is shown to be sufficient in coordinating the market. In our paper, unsurprisingly, the stochastic yield makes a one-part subsidy ineffectual for market coordination. Perhaps more unexpectedly, even a two-part fixed subsidy scheme cannot coordinate the market. The coordinating subsidy is a two-part menu of subsidies that depends on the coverage. This fundamental difference in the equilibrium outcome is essentially a result of the significant differences in the modeling contexts, requiring different analyses.",

For example, Taylor and Yadav (2011) investigate two forms of contracts for public products (e.g., essential medicines): a purchase subsidy (to the retailers) and a sales subsidy (to the consumers). They show that when consumers are homogeneous in their valuation of the product, the subsidy provider (donor) would prefer a purchase subsidy, whereas a sales subsidy is more preferable for heterogeneous consumers. A key assumption in (Taylor and Yadav, 2011) is that the retailer has freedom to set prices after market uncertainties are resolved and the product is acquired. This is a valid assumption for their model as they consider populations in developing countries where the retailer can change prices based on market conditions. In our model, however, the uncertainty exists with respect to the yield (not the demand), and pricing and production decisions are made prior to the realization of the yield. The manufacturer, once committed to a fixed price, cannot change it easily. Ovchinnikov and Raz (2012) study a number of mechanisms to coordinate price and quantity decisions in a market for public goods where these decisions are made simultaneously. They show the effectiveness of subsidies compared to rebates in coordinating either price or quantity decisions. They also show that a joint rebate-subsidy mechanism can coordinate both decisions. However, both the aforementioned papers assume a deterministic supply but a random demand. We, on the other hand, consider a scenario where supply is uncertain and demand is deterministic (e.g., the case of pre-orders for influenza vaccine). Finally, we focus on a specific class of products\u2014vaccines\u2014rather than a generic product. This allows us to derive a demand function that is based not only on economic parameters such as the vaccine price, but also on other epidemiological factors such as the population\u2019s perception of the vaccine effectiveness and the dynamics of the infection.",

Second, our model contributes to the operations management literature by considering contracting issues within a production process with random supply and price-dependent demand. While others have examined single-period models with random and price-dependent demand (Petruzzi and Dada, 1999), as well as supply contracts in that setting (Cachon, 2003), we show that effects of random supply are different than those of random demand when considering price-sensitive consumers, and thus the resulting coordinating mechanism must differ accordingly. More specifically, we show that a menu of two-level incentive mechanism is needed to coordinate the market, and a simple two-part fixed subsidy is not sufficient to align both the quantity and pricing decisions simultaneously. Our results have important implications in terms of the role of governments and global health organizations in managing vaccine programs and provide directions for appropriate incentive schemes that can work towards a greater good.",

This is captured by indexing consumers by a parameter u that is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the interval (0, 1); u can be viewed as the relative loss suffered by an individual from an infection. This assumption allows us to model individuals who perceive the vaccine as dangerous and are thus more willing to risk infection rather than be vaccinated (low value of u), as well as individuals like children and the elderly who, for example, are more prone to complications when contracting influenza and would thus experience more disutility from an infection (high value of u).

Following Mamani et al. (2012), by p(f) and P(f), we denote the infection probabilities for the vaccinated and unvaccinated fractions, respectively, for an overall vaccine coverage of f; P(f) must be strictly greater than p(f) for the vaccine to have any value. The infection probability for the entire population, r(f), can also be viewed as the overall fraction of infected individuals in the population:r(f)=fp(f)+(1-f)P(f).Let the price of the vaccine be W. Since vaccines are not fully effective, an immunized person incurs a vaccine cost of W and may still get infected. Therefore, W\n + \nLup(f) represents the total expected cost of getting vaccinated. On the other hand, a consumer who has not been immunized does not incur the cost of W but has a higher chance, P(f), of becoming infected. The expected cost incurred by a unimmunized individual is thus LuP(f). Therefore, for the indifferent consumer, the average cost of getting vaccinated and the cost of an infection are the same. Let u\u00af denote such a marginal consumer, then we have: Lu\u00afP(f)=W+Lu\u00afp(f), or W=Lu\u00af(P(f)-p(f)). Any consumer with u\u2a7eu\u00af gets immunized, whereas anyone with u<u\u00af does not. Therefore, u\u00af=1-f, as u is uniformly distributed over (0, 1). Substituting this and using the fact that P(f)-p(f)=r(f)-p(f)1-f, we get:(1)w=WL=r(f)-p(f)\u2261T(f).Eq. (1) tells us that consumers make their vaccination decisions in such a manner that the normalized price, w, of a vaccine represents the marginal reduction it induces in the probability of infection.",

This assumption, however, may not be valid for a number of infectious diseases of interest, such as seasonal influenza and HIV.\n3 In this regard, we follow Mamani et al. (2012) and assume that vaccines may indeed be imperfect\u2014a vaccinated consumer, albeit less likely, can still get and transmit the infection. There are two ways in which an imperfect vaccine affects the transmission of the disease: First, imperfect vaccines can reduce the probability of becoming infected if exposed to an infectious contact, which is known as the vaccine effect on susceptibility. Second, imperfect vaccines can also affect the probability of disease transmission when a vaccinated individual gets infected; this is known as the vaccine effect on infectiousness (Datta et al., 1998, Hill and Longini, 2003). To combine these two effects, we take an approach that is similar to the one adopted by Longini et al. (1978). Let 0 < \n\u03d5\n \u2a7d 1 be the vaccine efficacy parameter that reflects the combined effect of vaccine on transmission, which includes both susceptibility and infectiousness effects.

The willingness to pay for consumer u is given by WTPu\n = \nLu(P(f) \u2212 \np(f)). The fact that WTPu depends on f, the market coverage, is an evidence of the presence of a network effect. Now, note that, when \u03d5\n = 1, p(f) becomes zero as the vaccine is perfect; if, in addition R\n0\n \u2192 \u221e, then r(f) \u2192 (1 \u2212 \nf) and P(f) \u2192 1; this is because, when the reproduction number becomes large, an unvaccinated individual is almost certain to contract the infection. In this case, P(f) \u2212 \np(f) = 1, and WTPu becomes independent of the coverage level. Therefore, in this limiting case, the actions of other individuals become irrelevant. As a result, the externality effect completely disappears\u2014the only way to enjoy the benefits of the vaccine is to acquire it. In contrast, if R\n0\n < \u221e or \u03d5\n < 1, the term P(f) \u2212 \np(f) is lower than 1 and is no longer independent of f. This implies that, for the same consumer, WTPu is lower than in the limiting case considered above, and its specific value depends on the overall coverage level. Therefore, the desire to purchase depends not only on a consumer\u2019s own preference, but also on decisions made by other consumers. This happens because an unvaccinated individual could benefit from the (partial) immunity of the vaccinated population. Put differently, unlike typical products or services, in the vaccine market, a consumer does gain some utility from the vaccine, without having to actually purchase it. Hence, the coverage level has an impact on the purchase decision of an individual.",

First, the probability of infection for vaccinated individuals must be less than that for the general population, i.e., p(f) < \nr(f), for all f. Second, when the vaccine is fully effective, a vaccinated individual will not contract the disease, implying p(f) = 0 if \u03d5\n = 1. The following functional form abides by these two conditions and provides a good approximation of the exact infection probability function (see Appendix B in the Electronic Companion to this paper for details):p(f)=\u03b7(1-\u03d5)r(f),where 0\u2a7d\u03b7\u2a7d11-\u03d5 is a constant; in this paper, we use this functional form for p(f). Using this approximation, we find that WTPu=Lu\u03b8r(f)1-f, where \u03b8\n = 1 \u2212 \n\u03b7(1 \u2212 \n\u03d5). Therefore, the externality effect, which can be viewed as the strength of the dependence of WTPu on f, can be written as:EFu=\u2202WTPu\u2202f=0,iff>F=R0-1\u03d5R0,Lu\u03b8(1-f)21-\u03d5-1R0,otherwise.It is now easy to see that, when f\n < \nF, EFu depends on both R\n0 and \u03d5; it approaches zero when R\n0\n \u2192 \u221e and \u03d5\n \u2192 1, but is non-zero otherwise.

This threshold occurs at a lower value of f when the vaccine is less perfect because the equilibrium price of a vaccine with a lower \u03d5 is also lower. We also notice that for a fixed coverage level f, the lower the value of \u03d5, the lower is the quantity produced by the manufacturer, since the vaccine price decreases as \u03d5 decreases. Finally, we note that q\nm(f) is not necessarily monotonic in f, even to the left of the threshold; this can be clearly seen in the plot corresponding to \u03d5\n = 1. There, the quantity first increases in f as a larger demand provides incentives to supply higher quantities.

Moreover, high externality effects (low R\n0) lead to lower coverage as a single vaccination helps protect more individuals against the disease. We also observe that when the per unit cost is low, the manufacturer has an incentive to produce high quantities of the vaccine (compared to the equilibrium coverage); as the cost increases, however, the yield uncertainty makes it too risky to produce extra vaccines, and the quantity drops below the equilibrium demand.",

The comparison of Fig. 3 with Fig. 2 makes the role of vaccine effectiveness clear. First, for low values of the production cost, the vaccine coverage at equilibrium decreases with vaccine effectiveness, but this trend reverses for high production cost. This illustrates that a more ineffective vaccine requires more coverage in the population to achieve the same level of protection, which is possible only when the vaccine is cheap enough to produce. When it is more expensive, a lack of effectiveness makes the vaccine less worthwhile to purchase, and coverage drops. Moreover, the equilibrium quantity is lower than when the vaccine is perfect.

In addition, we also account for the societal surplus that may accrue from a lower infection rate.\nManufacturer surplus: The manufacturer surplus is the net profit earned by the manufacturer when the target production quantity is q, and a fraction g\n = min{Uq, \nf} of the population is vaccinated.Manufacturersurplus=\u03c3M=wg-cq.\n\nVaccinated consumers\u2019 surplus: When individuals are vaccinated, their probability of infection reduces and the expected cost from infection is lower. The aggregate normalized cost for purchasing the vaccine is wg. If these individuals were not vaccinated, the total vaccinated fraction would be zero and their probability of getting infected would be r(0); if they do get infected, they incur a normalized infection cost u\n \u2208 [1 \u2212 \ng, 1). The surplus gained from vaccination for this fraction of the population is then the difference between the costs with and without vaccination.Vaccinatedsurplus=\u03c3V=\u222b1-g1x(r(0)-p(g))dx-wg=12-(1-g)22(r(0)-p(g))-wg.\n\nUnvaccinated consumers\u2019 surplus: One of the key differences between vaccines and most other products is that an individual can enjoy some surplus even if (s)he does not purchase or acquire the product, because of the immunity generated by other vaccinated individuals that leads to the negative network externality effect. The unvaccinated consumers\u2019 surplus is determined as the difference in utility between when the remaining consumers get vaccinated and when they do not. Each individual in the unvaccinated fraction, with a normalized infection cost u\n \u2208 (0, 1 \u2212 \ng), has a probability P(g) of becoming infected when the other fraction is vaccinated, and a probability r(0) of becoming infected when the other fraction is not vaccinated. Calculating the difference in total cost between these two situations yields the total surplus gained for this fraction of the population from the presence of the vaccine. Therefore, the unvaccinated fraction (1 \u2212 \ng) gets a surplus of:Unvaccinatedsurplus=\u03c3N=\u222b01-gx(r(0)-P(g))dx=(r(0)-P(g))(1-g)22.\n\nSocietal surplus: To obtain the total social welfare, we also consider the indirect cost to the society\u2014we assume that every individual who gets infected poses a normalized loss of \u03bb on the society; this cost could include a societal loss of work time and healthcare costs. Ovchinnikov and Raz (2012) consider a similar term in their social welfare function called the \u201cexternality effect\u201d that represents the public interest component of the product. Since, a fraction r(g) is likely to get infected in an expected sense, we write the societal surplus as:Societalsurplus=\u03c3S=-\u03bbr(g).\n\n",

However, this does not imply that it is socially optimal to always reach this high vaccine uptake. Having the demand at its maximum ensures that the demand will not be the bottleneck in determining the coverage.

Similar to the market equilibrium case, for low values of c, the targeted production quantity exceeds the demand so as not to risk inventory shortages. However, as the cost parameter, c, increases, the targeted production falls below the demand to avoid over-producing expensive vaccines that are likely to go unsold. The impact of vaccine effectiveness is also clear from Fig. 4. For low values of c, the optimal production and coverage levels both increase as the effectiveness, \u03d5, decreases. This is to be expected\u2014as the vaccine effectiveness goes down, it becomes necessary to immunize a larger fraction of the population to obtain the same level of immunity and to produce more to meet that higher coverage level. However, at high values of c, maintaining a high level of immunity is no longer desirable. There, the trend reverses. Both optimal production and coverage level decrease quickly and reduce to zero as the vaccine effectiveness decreases. It is not optimal to keep producing an ineffective vaccine at a high production cost. It is also clear from these plots that the socially optimal production and coverage levels increase with R\n0. This is expected\u2014as R\n0 increases, the higher level of infectiousness makes it necessary to produce more vaccines in order to immunize a larger fraction of the population.",

Of course, as amply demonstrated in Fig. 4, achieving the herd immunity may not always be optimal for the society as a whole (if, for example, the vaccine is very expensive to produce and an infection causes little harm or disutility to consumers). Government intervention should thus aim at not necessarily achieving a vaccine coverage equal to the critical vaccination fraction, but rather to some fraction that optimizes a measure of the societal benefit. In this section, we propose an incentive mechanism that can eliminate the market inefficiencies and achieve the social optimum.",

We focus on subsidies to simultaneously coordinate price and quantity decisions. Furthermore, since both price and quantity decisions are made before resolving the yield uncertainty, a simple one-parameter subsidy is not sufficient to coordinate both decisions at the same time. This is due to the fact that a subsidy that can provide incentives to the individuals to ensure a sufficiently high level of vaccine coverage (coordinate price) does not necessarily align the manufacturer\u2019s production decision, under yield uncertainty, with the central planner\u2019s objective (coordinate quantity). A similar behavior can be observed in the classical Newsvendor model with price-dependent demand (e.g., Cachon, 2003). Therefore, we consider a two-parameter incentive mechanism (s, \ne), in which a subsidy s is provided to the consumers (to coordinate the vaccine price or equivalently vaccine coverage, f), and, under a cost sharing proposal, the central planner agrees to pay e to the manufacturer for every production unit (to coordinate production quantity, q).\n5 The cost sharing component in this contract is analogous to the purchase subsidy, and the subsidy component of our contract is similar to the sales subsidy in (Taylor and Yadav, 2011). One way to implement the contract, among several other possible alternatives, would be to offer both incentives as a package. The manufacturer could purchase the raw materials for the production directly from the government at a per unit cost of c\n \u2212 \ne. In return, the manufacturer would get a payment of s for each vaccine sold to the consumers, whereas the customers would only pay w\n \u2212 \ns to the manufacturer at the time of purchase. Thus, the effective production cost to the manufacturer would become c\n \u2212 \ne, and the demand-price relationship can be written as:w=s+T(f).The manufacturer\u2019s profit can be written as follows.\u03c0(q,f)=(T(f)+s)\u222b0fqxqdJ(x)+(T(f)+s)\u222bfqU\u00affdJ(x)-(c-e)q.In what follows, we first obtain the optimal production quantity for a fixed demand f, denoted by q\nm(f), and then find the equilibrium demand, f\nm.

As long as f\n\u2217 is kept at a constant value, the subsidy s also remains constant, and s drops to zero when f\n\u2217 drops to zero. It is interesting to observe, from Fig. 5, that as R\n0 increases, i.e., as the negative externality effect lessens, the subsidy to the manufacturer decreases and that to consumers increases. Indeed, a higher value of R\n0 implies a higher vaccinated fraction at the social optimum, hence a higher subsidy to consumers is necessary to induce the socially optimal coverage. Some of this subsidy to consumers gets transferred to the manufacturers via a higher demand, and thus the direct subsidy to the manufacturer decreases. Finally, as the vaccine becomes less effective, that is, as \u03d5 becomes smaller, the subsidy to consumers decreases. Two effects are at play here for the overall impact of vaccine effectiveness on the subsidies. On one hand, a less effective vaccine requires more individuals to be vaccinated to achieve the same level of immunity within the population; hence, for low c, f\n\u2217 increases as \u03d5 decreases (see Fig. 4). On the other, subsidizing a less effective vaccine represents a more wasteful measure to protect the population as more vaccinated individuals will contract the disease, especially when the vaccine is costly to produce. As a result, for high values of c, f\n\u2217 is zero for a less effective vaccine, but f\n\u2217 is positive for a more effective vaccine. The socially optimal subsidy program is a combination of these two effects. We find that the second effect dominates the first and the subsidy to consumers is lower for a less effective vaccine. Finally, a quick comparison of the first two panels in Fig. 5 with the last two reveals that our results are quite robust to distributional assumptions about U.",

To see this, we substitute the subsidy from Theorem 3 and solve for f to obtain:f=11-\u03d5w\u03b8-\u03d5F.Therefore, the subsidy can be implemented based on the vaccine price as follows:s(w)=11-\u03d5(w-\u03b8\u03d5F),0\u2a7dw<\u03b8(\u03d5F+(1-\u03d5)f\u2217)\u03b8f\u2217,\u03b8(\u03d5F+(1-\u03d5)f\u2217)\u2a7dw<\u03b8(\u03d5F+(1-\u03d5)F\u00af)0,w\u2a7e\u03b8(\u03d5F+(1-\u03d5)F\u00af).\n\nRemark 2The piecewise linear subsidy scheme described in Theorem 3 is only one of many mechanisms that can coordinate this market.

            "text": "Infectious diseases remain an important world-wide public health threat. Vaccines are available for many of these diseases and are generally considered a safe and cost-effective prevention tool. Government intervention via vaccine subsidy programs is an important weapon against the spread of infectious diseases. Without this type of programs, spontaneous market behavior leads to a vaccine coverage that is often too low to achieve herd immunity and is always less than the socially optimal level of vaccine coverage. There are two reasons for this: On the consumer side, there are negative network effects of vaccines\u2014as more individuals get vaccinated, the chance of infection, and hence the willingness to pay for the vaccine, for an unvaccinated individual, decreases. On the supply side, production uncertainties make it too risky for manufacturers to produce sufficiently large quantities. Government intervention may improve public health by providing subsidies as incentives to reduce these inefficiencies. In this paper, we synthesize concepts from three areas\u2014economics, operations management, and epidemiology\u2014to analyze the effect of the network externalities and yield uncertainties on the outcome of the monopoly market as well as the first best solution. We also derive a coordination scheme via subsidies to align the market outcome with the centralized solution. We show that a fixed one- or two-parameter subsidy structure cannot provide appropriate incentive to the consumers and the vaccine manufacturer to guarantee a socially optimal vaccine coverage that maximizes the total social welfare, but a two-part menu of subsidies can.",

This is amply illustrated in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, where we plot the socially optimal outcomes and subsidy payments, respectively, for two different distributions of the yield. In the first two panels in each figure, the yield is uniformly distributed and, in the last two, it follows a truncated normal distribution (with the same mean and variance as the uniform distribution). It can be clearly seen that the results do not seem sensitive to the distribution of the production yield; in fact, two very different types of distributions lead to very similar results for other key metrics such as equilibrium outcome (Fig. 2, Fig. 3) and social welfare (Fig. 5, Fig. 7) as well. This robustness of the equilibrium outcome, first best solution, coordinating subsidy scheme, and social welfare with respect to the distribution of the yield has important practical implications. Often, it is quite difficult to accurately estimate the distribution of an uncertain parameter such as the production yield. It is common to have good estimates for some of its characteristics, such as the mean and variance, but to expect a full knowledge of the exact distribution is often unrealistic. Our results indicate that this would not be an issue within our research context, as the findings are almost unchanged when the distribution is modified while retaining the mean and variance at their respective values. The material implication is that inaccuracies in estimating the yield distribution would not have much of an impact in the implementation of our approach.",

It would be interesting to investigate the impact of competition in this market. We could do this by extending our model to consider two or more competing firms in the same vaccine market. Although the algebra becomes intractable, we can obtain numerical results in that case. Second, in this study, we assume a constant unit cost of production. In reality, there are usually large fixed costs and economies of scale in vaccine production. Both these factors tend to impact the production decision in exactly the opposite manner, when compared to the impacts of negative network effect and yield uncertainty\u2014while the former two favor a higher output, the latter two tend to induce the manufacturer to under-produce. This trade-off is an interesting topic to explore. While analytical solutions are difficult to obtain, once again, we can obtain numerical solutions for this trade-off. Furthermore, we do not address the issue of how to pay for the subsidy. In order to achieve revenue-neutrality, one would need to develop a combined tax-subsidy scheme where the taxes exactly pay for the subsidies. Finally, in practice, a big portion of the total demand for influenza vaccine is realized as pre-orders from healthcare providers, and the manufacturer caters to the current unmet demand only after meeting the pre-orders received prior to vaccine production. In this paper, we assume that the total demand from a healthcare provider for a certain vaccine price effectively mirrors the actual demand from consumers based on demand and price elasticity information from prior periods; this translates to merging the actual consumers with healthcare providers as the \u201cconsumers\u201d in our model. It may be interesting to extend the model to distinguish the pre-order and consumer demands.
