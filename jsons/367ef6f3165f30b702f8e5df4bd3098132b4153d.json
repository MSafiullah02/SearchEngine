In order to reduce the possible transmission risk, from 0:00 on March 25, 2020, Hong Kong announced that non-Hong Kong people are prohibited from entering Hong Kong Airport. However, as an international financial and transportation center, Hong Kong will cause a lot of losses every day due to the international traffic blockade. Therefore, it is of great significance to predict the possible cumulative case growth rate of Hong Kong under the premise of incomplete blockade, and to further determine the possible date of unblocking in Hong Kong. However, the transmission rate in the traditional SIR/SEIR model is a constant value. However in practical problems, the transmission rate is constantly changing.",

For example, we assume that international tourists in Hong Kong will be quarantined and all infected persons will be diagnosed. However, some asymptomatic infected persons may still be missed, causing local transmission in Hong Kong. Therefore, in the next step we plan to count the asymptomatic infection rate in Hong Kong and further improve the model in this article.",

We can determine the parameters of the model, such as recovery rate, mortality rate, diagnosis rate, etc., We use SEJIR model to predict the epidemic growth trend in areas relevant to Hong Kong, such as United States, Italy, etc. Based on the results of the SEJIR model, we can finally use the Passive Aggressive Algorithm to predict the future development trend of Hong Kong.
