            "text": "Was the 1993/1994 fatal canine distemper virus (CDV) epidemic in lions and spotted hyaenas in the Serengeti ecosystem caused by the recent spillover of a virulent domestic dog strain or one well adapted to these noncanids? We examine this question using sequence data from 13 'Serengeti' strains including five complete genomes obtained between 1993 and 2011. Phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses reveal that strains from noncanids during the epidemic were more closely related to each other than to those from domestic or wild canids. All noncanid 'Serengeti' strains during the epidemic encoded: (1) one novel substitution G134S in the CDV-V protein; and (2) the rare amino acid combination 519I/549H at two sites under positive selection in the region of the CDV-H protein that binds to SLAM (CD 150) host cell receptors. Worldwide, only a few noncanid strains in the America II lineage encode CDV-H 519I/549H. All canid 'Serengeti' strains during the epidemic coded CDV-V 134G, and CDV-H 519R/549Y, or 519R/549H. A functional assay of cell entry revealed the highest performance by CDV-H proteins encoding 519I/549H in cells expressing lion SLAM receptors, and the highest performance by proteins encoding 519R/549Y, typical of dog strains worldwide, in cells expressing dog SLAM receptors. Our findings are consistent with an epidemic in lions and hyaenas caused by CDV variants better adapted to noncanids than canids, but not with the recent spillover of a dog strain. Our study reveals a greater complexity of CDV molecular epidemiology in multihost environments than previously thought.",

Current evidence suggests that closely related species are more susceptible to infection by a given virus or strain than more distantly related hosts (Read & Taylor 2001; Faria et al. 2013; Longdon et al. 2014 ), because they provide a similar cellular environment to which the pathogen is adapted. However, there are viruses where this does not apply (e.g. Greenwood et al. 2012; Shi et al. 2014 ). Adaptation of virus attachment proteins to the cell receptor used by viruses to gain entry to host cells can alter virus spread across host species and has resulted in epidemics in novel hosts (Moya et al. 2004; Allison et al. 2014; Shi et al. 2014) .",

            "text": "Canine distemper virus (CDV) belongs to the genus Morbillivirus (family Paramyxoviridae). CDV has a nonsegmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome with six genes that produce six structural proteins. The nucleocapsid protein (CDV-N) encapsidates the viral RNA, and the phosphoprotein (CDV-P) together with the large protein (CDV-L) form the transcriptase/ replicase complex. The CDV-P gene also expresses two nonstructural proteins, the CDV-C and CDV-V proteins. One function of the CDV-V protein is to suppress the innate immune response of hosts (von Messling et al. 2006; R\u20ac othlisberger et al. 2010) . The haemagglutinin protein (CDV-H) and the fusion protein (CDV-F) facilitate virus entry and the matrix protein (CDV-M) is important for the budding of virus particles (Lamb & Kolakofsky 2001) . As the CDV-H gene is the most diverse gene in the Morbillivirus genus (Pomeroy et al. 2008) , it is used to segregate strains into lineages (Bolt et al.1997; Martella et al. 2006) , whereas the CDV-L and CDV-M genes are more conserved than other genes in the Paramyxoviridae (McCarthy & Goodman 2010). The long untranslated region (UTR) between the CDV-M and F genes (M-F UTR) modulates virulence through transcriptional control of CDV-F gene expression (Anderson & von Messling 2008) .",

The outcome of CDV infection ranges from subclinical to lethal; survival of infection provides lifelong immunity (Appel & Summers 1995) . Clinical disease and virus shedding occurs once CDV has completed two stages of infection (Sawatsky et al. 2012) . During the first stage, CDV targets the signalling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM, CD150) receptors expressed on the surface of T and B lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells (Tatsuo et al. 2001; von Messling et al. 2006) . Virus entry occurs when the CDV-H protein attaches to SLAM receptors and together with the CDV-F protein accomplishes fusion with host cell membranes (von Messling et al. 2001; Tatsuo et al. 2001) . Virus amplification in lymphatic tissues and circulating lymphocytes induces immunosuppression and the spread of CDV through the bloodstream (Lamb & Kolakofsky 2001) . In the second stage of infection, CDV enters epithelial cells using the nectin-4 receptor (Noyce et al. 2013) , leading to the manifestation of disease and virus shedding (Sawatsky et al. 2012) .",

Carnivore SLAM proteins reflect this ancient bifurcation (Nikolin et al. 2012b) , as SLAM proteins from caniform species within family Canidae have high amino acid sequence identity and a far lower identity to those in feliform species in families Felidae and Hyaenidae. McCarthy et al. (2007) proposed that efficient virus binding to SLAM receptors in carnivores other than the domestic dog (hereafter termed dog) requires adaptations in the SLAM-binding region of the CDV-H protein. They identified that sites 530 and 549 in this region were under positive selection and that most CDV-H proteins from dog strains encode tyrosine (Y) at site 549 whereas those in strains from other carnivores mostly specified histidine (H). This finding is supported by several empirical studies (Monne et al. 2011; Kameo et al. 2012; Nikolin et al. 2012a; Origgi et al. 2012 ) and the occurrence of the Y549H substitution during experimental adaptation of a dog CDV strain to ferrets (Mustela putorius furo, family Mustelidae) (von Messling et al. 2003) . A quantitative assessment of the functional importance of the residue at site 549 revealed that CDV-H proteins encoding 549Y performed significantly better in cells expressing dog SLAM receptors than those encoding 549H, whereas proteins encoding 549H performed better in cells expressing lion (Panthera leo, family Felidae) SLAM than those specifying 549Y, thereby indicating antagonistic pleiotropic effects of the residue at site 549 on CDV-H-mediated attachment to SLAM receptors in distantly related carnivore species (Nikolin et al. 2012b) . Even so, variants specifying 549Y can cause clinical disease in noncanids (e.g. Meli et al. 2010; Keller et al. 2012; Seimon et al. 2014 ) and those encoding 549H can cause disease in dogs (e.g. Fischer et al. 2016) .",

A CDV epidemic emerged in the Serengeti National Park (NP) in northeast Tanzania in November 1993 (Haas et al. 1996) and then spread through the Serengeti ecosystem (Roelke-Parker et al. 1996) , including the Maasai Mara National Reserve (NR) in Kenya (Harrison et al. 2004) . Unexpectedly, it caused high morbidity and mortality in juvenile and adult lions (Roelke-Parker et al. 1996; Munson et al. 2008 ) and predominantly juvenile (<12 months of age) spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta, family Hyaenidae, hereafter termed hyaena) (Haas et al. 1996) . In canids, infection was confirmed in two bat-eared foxes (Otocyon megalotis), and neurological signs were observed in two silver-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) and one golden jackal (Canis aureus) (Roelke-Parker et al. 1996) . Since this epidemic, CDV has not caused clinical disease in either the lion (Munson et al. 2008) or hyaena populations (M. L. East and H. Hofer unpublished data) in the Serengeti NP, despite serological data revealing three periods of increased CDV seroprevalence (1999-2001, 2006/2007 and 2010/2011) in lions in the Serengeti NP (Munson et al. 2008; Viana et al. 2015) , and hyaenas in the Maasai Mara NR in 2000 (Harrison et al. 2004) .",

(1996) proposed that a virulent CDV 'biotype' spread from dogs outside the Serengeti NP to wild carnivores inside the park. More recently, a stochastic model (Guiserix et al. 2007) suggested that low herd immunity among lions, rather than CDV virulence, better explained the epidemic. Neither a stochastic model (Craft et al. 2008) or network model (Craft et al. 2009 ) could explain the observed spread of CDV in prides during the epidemic purely by lion-to-lion transmission, and hence, both posited that a single variant circulating in dogs and wild carnivores was repeatedly introduced by jackals and hyaenas to prides.",

If CDV in 1993/1994 spread from dogs to lions and hyaenas, as proposed by Roelke-Parker et al. (1996) , we expect genetic sequence data to reveal a close relationship between strains from dog and noncanid hosts during this epidemic. The theory of virus-host adaptation suggests that virus transmission chains within one host species could lead to beneficial adaptations to this host which might be detrimental to the virus in distantly related hosts. We therefore predicted that (1) CDV strains adapted to dogs should outcompete non-canidadapted strains in dogs and cause clinical disease in closely related wild canids but not in noncanids; (2) if several strains circulate, then those adapted to noncanids should outcompete canid-adapted strains in noncanids, but not in canids; and (3) strains causing clinical disease in wild canids are less likely to do so in noncanids. We tested these ideas by examining the relationship between strains from different carnivores and the infection outcome from 1993 to 2011. We also assess the functional importance of the amino acid combination at two sites under positive selection in the CDV-H SLAM-binding region in cellular environments expressing SLAM receptors from canids or noncanids.",

One variant from an African wild dog (Lycaon pictus, family Canidae) came from a pack that died of CDV in 2007 (Goller et al. 2010 ) and another from a golden jackal was obtained from bloody faeces from a pup that succumbed to canine distemper in 2011. Samples were stored either at \u00c080\u00b0C until processed or placed in RNAlater and then stored frozen at \u00c010\u00b0C in Tanzania and then at \u00c080\u00b0C at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research until processed. Sequences were also obtained from four CDV isolates collected in the Serengeti NP in 1994 and stored at the Virology Section Diagnostic Center, Cornell University (i.e. SNP/1994/African lion, SNP/1994/spotted hyaena, SNP/1994/bat-eared fox, SE/ 1994/domestic dog). RNA isolation from samples was performed using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In total, we obtained five complete CDV genome sequences, six complete CDV-H gene sequences plus an additional seven partial CDV-H gene sequences, all of which spanned the SLAM-binding region of the CDV-H gene, and eight complete CDV-P gene sequences (Table S2 , Supporting information).",

Baits were generated from PCR products covering the complete genome of variant SE/1994/domestic dog. Libraries were indexed by sample and were built as previously described (Meyer & Kircher 2010) . Baits and cDNA libraries were constructed in separate laboratories to avoid contamination. Enriched libraries from the hybrid capture were deep-sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq \u2122 platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Sequence quality was assessed as previously described (Olarte-Castillo et al. 2015) . Trimmed reads from each sample were assembled against reference strain 171391-513 (Accession no. KJ123771), using the medium sensitivity method with up to 10 iterations in GENEIOUS 9.0.2 (Biomatters Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand). Genome organization and predicted gene products of the sequenced 'Serengeti' variants (Table S2 , Supporting information) were identical to those of other canine distemper viruses. The genomes were 15 690 nucleotides long and contained six open reading frames (ORF) coding for six structural proteins (N, P, M, F, H and L). Within the CDV-P gene sequence was an additional ORF coding for the nonstructural C protein. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to amplify the complete CDV-H gene (1824 nucleotides, position within viral genome: 7079-8902) and the complete P gene (1524 nucleotides, position within the viral genome: 1801-3324). When we could not obtain the entire CDV-H gene, we amplified a 514-nucleotide segment of the 3 0 -end of this gene (position within viral genome: 8479-8993) which included the SLAM-binding region. PCR products were cloned into the PCR 2.1 TOPO vector and sequenced. Nucleic acid sequences were edited and aligned using the multiple alignment method (ClustalW) incorporated within the computer program MEGA 6.0 (www.megasoftware.net) (Tamura et al. 2013) . Accession numbers and details for CDV-P and CDV-H gene sequences generated by this study are listed in Table S2 (Supporting information).",

For the complete M-F UTR and the CDV-N, CDV-M, CDV-F and CDV-L genes, the Tamura 3-parameter model was used. For amino acid sequences of the four proteins, the Jones-Taylor-Thornton model (Jones et al. 1992 ) was used. Statistical support was provided by 1000 bootstrap replicates, and the respective percentages are quoted on branches. The haplotype networks for 'Serengeti' variants were built using the medianjoining algorithm (Bandelt et al. 1999 ) by the computer program NETWORK 4.6.1.2. (fluxus-engineering.com). Similarities along the genome (Fig. 1a) were visualized with SIMPLOT 5.1 (Lole et al. 1999 ) using the Kimura 2-parameter distance model with a sliding frame of 400 nucleotides and a step distance of 20 bases.",

The assay methods are detailed in full by Nikolin et al. (2012b) . Briefly, Vero cell lines that stably expressed dog SLAM, lion SLAM or domestic cat SLAM were seeded in 12-well plates and cotransfected using 1 lL of Fugene transfection reagent (Roche, Germany) with 0.10 lg of each CDV-H and CDV-F expression plasmids in six different combinations (1) ",

The large noncanid node was separated from the hypothetical node by a single nucleotide substitution at site 134 in both the CDV-P and CDV-V proteins which resulted in a nonsynonymous amino acid substitution. All 'Serengeti' canid variants (Fig. 5b ) encoded glycine (G) and all noncanid variants from 1993/1994 encoded serine (S). BlastX searches revealed that only noncanid 'Serengeti' variants encode S, whereas CDV variants worldwide encode G, regardless of host species (Fig. 5b) . In the CDV-C protein, this nucleotide difference is a synonymous substitution (glutamine at site 126 in both canid and noncanid strains).",

This assay quantified the MNN per syncytium as a proxy measure of the binding ability of CDV-H proteins to cells expressing SLAM receptors of a canid (dog) or two noncanid species (lion, domestic cat) and the consequent fusion activity of CDV-F protein. For this purpose, we used three wild-type CDV-H proteins, two from dog isolates encoding 519R/549Y (SE/1994/domestic dog and A75/17) and one from the 'Serengeti' lion isolate (SNP/1994/African lion) encoding 519I/549H. We also engineered three CDV-H mutants of the strain A75/ 17: (1) residue 519R was substituted for 519I to produce mutant A75/17-519I; (2) residue 549Y was substituted for 549H to produce mutant A75/17-549H; and (3) the residue at both sites were substituted to produce mutant A75/17-519I/549H.",

Canids were not infected by this strain type, and during the epidemic, a bat-eared fox was fatally infected with a strain encoding CDV-H 519R/549H and CDV-V 134G, and one dog was fatally infected with a strain encoding CDV-H 519R/549Y and CDV-V 134G. Although just two nucleotide substitutions (Fig. 4b) convert the SLAM-binding region from the most commonly described amino acid combination 519R/549Y to 519I/ 549H, evidence of substitution R519I is lacking from all CDV lineages except for the America II lineage and the East African lineage (Table S1, Supporting information). All strains encoding 519I/549H in both these lineages were from noncanid hosts.

These findings are consistent with the idea that the 1993/1994 epidemic in lions and hyaenas was caused by the evolution, in the diverse wild carnivore guild in the Serengeti ecosystem, of a strain better adapted to noncanids than canids. Similarly, genetically distinct strains of canine kobuvirus in this ecosystem circulate in domestic dogs and wild carnivores (Olarte-Castillo et al. 2015) , and distinct coronavirus strains circulate in wild canid and noncanid hosts (Goller et al. 2013) .",

No strain encoding 519I/549R was found in the Serengeti ecosystem, but this strain type caused a fatal CDV in javelina (Appel et al. 1991 ; Table S1, Supporting information). As we only screened carnivore species for CDV infection, we cannot exclude the possibility that strains encoding 519I/549R might occur in the Serengeti ecosystem in a noncarnivore such as the warthog (Phacochoerus aethiopicus). We only retrieved strains encoding CDV-H 519R/ 549Y or 519R/549H from canid species (Fig. 4a) with fatal disease (Table S5 , Supporting information) and from asymptomatic hyaenas (Table S5 , Supporting information).

In contrast, CDV-H proteins encoding 519I/549H performed relatively well in cells expressing lion SLAM receptors, cat SLAM receptors and dog SLAM receptors, but the performance of this combination in cells expressing dog SLAM was significantly below that of proteins specifying 519R/549Y, 519R/549H or 519I/549Y. These findings suggest that CDV-H proteins encoding 519I/549H exhibited the strongest 'generalist' traits, those specifying 519R/549Y displayed traits indicative of a dog 'specialist' strain (sensu Nikolin et al. 2012b ) and those encoding 519R/ 549H or 519I/549Y showed traits between these two extremes. During the first infection stage, dogs would therefore be particularly prone to strains encoding 519R/549Y, whereas lions would be particularly prone to infection by those encoding 519I/549H and far less so to infection with strains encoding 519R/549Y (Fig. 6) . Hence, our results indicate that strain type 519R/549Y would outcompete 519I/549H when infecting domestic dog immune cells and strain type 519I/549H would outcompete both 519R/549Y and 519R/549H when infecting lion immune cells.",

Adult hyaenas were asymptomatic when infected with variants encoding 519I/549H that were fatal to juvenile hyaenas (Haas et al. 1996) . Asymptomatic infection most likely represents a 'dead end' for CDV because virus shedding probably does not occur (Sawatsky et al. 2012) . This suggests that most adult hyaenas in the Serengeti ecosystem are 'dead-end' hosts for CDV, regardless of strain type, although lions might be infected if they killed an asymptomatic hyaena and hence contacted strain type 519I/549H from its blood. Juvenile hyaenas developed clinical disease during the 1993/ 1994 epidemic and were presumably the main shedders and transmitters of CDV within hyaena clans. By contrast, lions regardless of age developed clinical signs during this epidemic, hence shed and transmitted strain type 519I/549H within prides. We have no evidence that strain types 519R/549Y or 519R/549H in the East African lineage caused clinical disease in either lions or hyaenas thus suspect that these noncanids are 'deadend' hosts for them (Table S5 , Supporting information). Our results and those from the America II lineage indicate that strain type 519I/549H does not cause clinical CDV in canids. Hence, it is unlikely that canids transmitted this strain type to lions and hyaenas during the 1993/1994 epidemic.",

Our results suggest that lions and hyaenas typically clear canid-adapted CDV strains before clinical sign and virus shedding occurs and that outbreaks of canid-adapted strains in wild canid populations cause asymptomatic exposure in noncanids. These benign outcomes most likely explain 'silent' outbreaks in lions and hyaenas. Fatal CDV in an African wild dog pack in 2007 (Goller et al. 2010 ) and a golden jackal pup in 2011 is consistent with this idea, as both occurred when serological data from lions indicated elevated asymptomatic exposure (Viana et al. 2015) . Asymptomatic exposure to canid strains would increase herd immunity (Guiserix et al. 2007 ) and provide lifelong protection against future infection among exposed noncanids.",

Exposure of carnivores to other morbilliviruses such as rinderpest in the past (Dehay et al. 1965 ) and currently to peste des petits ruminants (PPR) (Swai et al. 2009 ) through the consumption of infected ungulates is also thought to induce antibody protection against CDV, and could be mistakenly interpreted as evidence of CDV exposure.",

Our results question this assumption by revealing genetically distinct strains in canids and noncanids during the epidemic (Figs 2-5) and by experimentally showing that canids would be unlikely to propagate the CDV-H 519I/549H CDV-V 134S strain type during the 1993/1994 epidemic in lions (Fig. 6) . In the hyaena population, virus shedders of strain type CDV-H 519I/549H CDV-V 134S during the disease epidemic were predominantly juveniles based at clan communal dens. In fission-fusion hyaena clans, communal dens are important social centres (Hofer & East 1995) that can facilitate pathogen transmission within clans . For this reason, exposure of adult clan members to virus shedding juveniles should relatively swiftly elevate herd immunity to CDV in clans and result in rapid 'burn-out' of na\u20ac \u0131ve juveniles at communal dens. We consider that juvenile hyaenas with clinical CDV at communal dens would rarely propagate the epidemic in lion prides. We suspect other noncanids contributed more significantly to the spread of CDV in the lion population during the 1993/1994 disease epidemic.",

Whether infection of the juvenile contributed to its predation by a lion is unknown (Table S5 , Supporting information). Between 2000 and 2011, strains encoding 519I/549H were not found, suggesting their possible fade-out in the Serengeti NP. Even so, we cannot exclude the possibility that this strain type continued to circulate in other noncanid species, possibly in small felids and species from the family Viverridae, such as common genet (Genetta genetta), which is susceptible to CDV infection (L opez-Pe\u00f1a et al. 2001) . Of the 26 wild carnivore species (Sinclair & Arcese 1995) known to occur in the Serengeti ecosystem, five belong to the Canidae and of these, four have been reported with fatal CDV infection. Besides lions and spotted hyaenas, currently little is known about CDV infection in the 19 other noncanid species present in the ecosystem.",

The challenge will be to incorporate our improving knowledge of molecular epidemiology into mathematical models to more accurately predict the probable impact of CDV in multihost communities and threatened species.",
