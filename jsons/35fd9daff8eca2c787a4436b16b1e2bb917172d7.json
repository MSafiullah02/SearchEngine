These measures initially received skeptical comments from most of the other countries, 18 however in a matter of weeks most western countries followed in issuing similar drastic measures. 19 From an epidemiological point of view, many of these countries are reporting a similar pattern of 20 infection curves with 2-3 weeks delay over Italy. 21 The public health system of Lombardia, where publicly run and privately-run hospitals 22 coexist, has been struck very hard by the epidemic, especially in municipalities like Cremona Lodi 23 and Bergamo where the hospitals were rapidly overwhelmed. The regional healthcare authorities 24 decided to create e Hub/Spoke system for cardiovascular and surgical emergencies, where a small number of large centers (Hubs: IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele Milano, Fondazione Poliambulanza 1 Brescia, Centro Cardiologico Monzino Milano, ASST Milanese Ospedale di Legnano) would serve 2 the whole region for non-elective cases, while greatly limiting the number of elective ones.
