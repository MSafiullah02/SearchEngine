In acute rhinosinusitis, several proinflammatory cytokines of different types have been identified. Initial information about the involvement of the inflammasome in rhinosinusitis has been gained, but this area remains open for more detailed research. Although it has been accepted now that chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) needs to be differentiated into CRS with and without nasal polyps, it has become clear that this distinction is insufficient to clearly define subgroups with uniform pathophysiology and cytokine patterns. While Th1-cytokines are mostly found in CRSsNP and Th2 cytokines in CRSwNP, there is a substantial overlap, and several other cytokines have also been detected. Attempts to identify CRS endotypes based on cytokines are ongoing but not yet generally accepted. Despite the central role of cytokines in rhinosinusitis, no specific cytokinetargeted therapies are currently available, and only very few studies have specifically addressed the effects of such biologicals in rhinosinusitis.",

If symptoms last more than 12 weeks without complete resolution, rhinosinusitis becomes a chronic disease (chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)); otherwise, it should still be termed acute [1\u2022\u2022] .",

Therefore, attempts to define endotypes in addition to phenotypes of rhinosinusitis are undertaken. Biological endotypes represent subgroups that differ in their pathophysiological mechanisms and the corresponding biomarkers [2\u2022\u2022] . The identification of such endotypes is not easy since the pathophysiology of CRS includes endogenous and exogenous factors that come together in each individual in a different extent and form a highly complex network of interaction. Thus, the task is to clarify these mechanisms and categorize them while taking into account the individual variation of endogenous and exogenous factors. Despite these difficulties, the definition of endotypes could be instrumental for the implementation of personalized therapy. Cytokines not only play a key role in orchestrating the cellular interactions but are also key biomarkers for the diverse endotypes and thus very appealing drug targets.",

The innate immune system is activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), expressed by specific pathogen classes that can activate PAMP receptors on cells of the immune system and other cell types. One type of PAMP receptors are patternrecognition receptors (PRR) called toll-like receptors (TLR). In response to infection with viruses or bacteria, certain TLRs are addressed. Ten different TLRs have been identified in humans, each one able to bind to specific ligands. Binding initiates intracellular signal cascades with a broad variety of effects on processes like hemostasis, inflammation, apoptosis, and also activation of the adaptive immune system. Activation of the adaptive immune system is induced by regulation of cytokines, chemokines, and other co-stimulatory mediators. Dependent on the pattern of the kind of activated CD4positive T cells and the upregulated and downregulated mediator, immune answers are initiated. Here, Th1-and Th2-like immune answers are classical. Furthermore, during the last years, Th17-, Th21-, and Treg T cell phenotypes and the corresponding immune responses were defined (Fig. 1) . In older studies, these are not considered. Compared to CRS, the role of cytokines in ARS is not explored in detail.",

PAMPs of other Gram-negative bacteria or S. pneumonia, microbes, often detected in ARS, are known to induce TLR-2 or TLR-4 related immune answers. The former generally initiate Th1-immune responses, and one may assume that this mechanism is also present in ARS. Nevertheless, van Rossum was not able to show upregulated IL-12 (typical for a Th1-response) nor upregulated IL-4 (typical for a Th2-response) in a murine model for nasopharyngeal S. pneumoniae colonization [5] . In contrast to this, Riechelmann et al. detected increased values for IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN in nasal fluids from ARS patients compared to CRS patients using a multiplex cytokine assay [6] .

Thus, it is obvious that the situation is more complex, especially when considering the advent of multiple additional T helper phenotypes such as Th17-, Th21-, and Treg in this context. Characteristic for Th17 cells is the production of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22 as well as IL-21. IL-17A induces IL-6 and IL-8 release in bronchial fibroblasts and airway smooth muscle cells as well as GRO-\u03b1 in the latter, leading to the attraction and activation of neutrophils [26, 27] . In CRSwNP, IL-17A is expressed in a subgroup of individuals [28\u2022\u2022, 29] . Especially in Asian patients, IL-17A expression is associated with the development of polyps. If IL-17A expression is associated with eosinophilic accumulation is discussed controversially [29, 30] .

These epithelial cytokines include IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, interferons, eotaxin, RANTES (regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), GM-CSF, monodansylcadaverin (MDC), stem cell factor (SCF), monocyte-chemotaxis-protein 4 (MCP-4), B cell activating factor (BAFF), and many more.

Myeloid (mDCs) and plasmacytoid (pDCs) dendritic subpopulations are accumulated in Th2-inflamed tissue.

            "text": "The typical accumulation of eosinophils in CRSwNP is substantially driven by high IL-5 levels that are produced by T cells and support priming and survival of eosinophils [18, 50] . Additionally, eosinophils are attracted by epithelial cells via the chemokines RANTES, MCP 1/2/3/4, and eotaxin [51] [52] [53] . Patients with eosinophilic, IL-5-and Th2-dominated inflammation with nasal polyps are clinically prone to \"late onset\" asthma development. They also show high TSLP levels in the local tissue as well as expression of CRTH2 and ST2 (IL33 receptor) [54\u2022, 55] . T cell activation marker soluble IL-2 receptor and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) are elevated in nasal polyps while TGF-\u00df1 and forkhead box protein 3 are downregulated. This leads to a reduction of Treg cells and their activity in CRSwNP that cannot be observed in CRSsNP [19, 56] .",

Remodeling is also controlled by cytokines, the TGF-\u00df-family (TGF-\u00df1 and TGF-\u00df2), their receptors (matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPS) are relevant in this context. Collagen deposition and an upregulation of the members of the TGF-\u00df-family and their receptors are shown in CRSsNP, whereas in CRSwNP, these cytokines and receptors as well as collagen deposition are downregulated [22] . Thus, it seems that this type of remodeling is more relevant in CRSsNP.",

It was shown that S. aureus colonization is associated with eosinophilic inflammation, nasal polyps, and Th2response though it is nor clear whether S. aureus colonization is facilitated by Th2 milieu or whether the bacterium generates it through exotoxins or other specific proteins [60\u2022\u2022, 61] . At least S. aureus superantigens seem to play an important role by generating a cytokine response from CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that intensify the Th2-immune response [62] and eosinophilic inflammation. Treg-associated cytokines IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21 are downregulated in the presence of S. aureus [63] .",
