Early data suggest that the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 appear to be higher among patients with underlying cardiovascular risk factors. Despite the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, in cardiomyocytes, there has been no evidence of direct viral infection although the presence of inflammation and viral genome within the hearts of COVID-19 patients have been reported. Here we transduced A549 lung epithelial cells with lentivirus overexpressing selected genes of the SARS-CoV-2. We then isolated exosomes from the supernatant of A549 cells and detected the presence of viral genome within the purified exosomes. Importantly, we observed that human induced pluripotent stem cellderived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) were able to actively uptake these exosomes and viral genes were subsequently detected in the cardiac cells. Accordingly, uptake of exosomes containing viral genes led to an upregulation of inflammation-related genes in hiPSC-CMs. Thus, our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 RNA-containing exosomes represent an indirect route of entry into cardiomyocytes resulting in potential cardiac dysfunction without the need for direct viral infection.",

Patients with COVID-19 have also been reported to start developing cardiovascular complications which were previously absent. However, it remains unclear whether exacerbated cardiac injury seen in COVID-19 patients results directly from viral SARS-CoV-2 infection of the myocardium or indirectly from the complications of COVID-19.",

The majority of cells in the body are known to release lipid bilayer membrane vesicles, also known as exosomes, that are capable of transferring various genetic materials such as RNAs to other recipient cells 5 . Therefore, in the present work, we hypothesized that rather than direct viral infection of cardiomyocytes, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells such as airway epithelial cells secrete exosomes carrying viral genetic material that are incorporated into cardiomyocytes and establish a critical indirect route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.",

A549 cells were chosen as a model cell type since COVID-19 appears to mainly infect respiratory tract cells in patients. Viral genes encoding for two non-structural proteins (Nsp1 and Nsp12) and two structural proteins (envelope E and nucleocapsid N) were used for this proof-of-principle study. We opted not to include the spike (S) protein which is required for receptor binding and viral entry to demonstrate the absence of components required for direct viral entry does not preclude exosomal-mediated transfer of viral genome into recipient cardiomyocytes. The use of lentivirus overexpressing viral subunits also allows us to distinguish exosome-mediated SARS-CoV-2 RNA transfer from canonical virus infection since exosome preparations inevitably contain infectious virions due to the overlap in size.",

Treatment of exosomal preparation with RNase A prior to RNA isolation did not reduce the mRNA levels and thus further confirmed their encapsulation within exosomes and consequently protection from nuclease digestion (data not shown). To study if human cardiomyocytes are able to uptake exosomes, we labeled exosomes with a fluorescent dye ExoGlow, and incubated them (100 \u03bcg) with human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs, 1 x 10 6 cells). Following 6 hours of 37\u00b0C incubation and washout of unbound exosomes, the presence of labeled exosomes was observed in treated hiPSC-CMs, confirming the successful uptake of exosomes by recipient cells ( Figure   1E ). Moreover, after exposure of hiPSC-CMs to A549 exosomes for 24 hours, we detected a significant presence of all four tested viral RNAs compared to hiPSC-CMs treated with control exosomes ( Figure 1F) . Functionally, A549 control exosomes resulted in an induction of proinflammatory genes in hiPSC-CMs, in accordance with previous reports of these exosomes of cancer origin being immunomodulatory 8 . This induction of pro-inflammatory genes was further elevated by exosomes containing Nsp1 suggesting the transferred viral genes are capable of eliciting cardiac inflammation ( Figure 1G) .",

F, qRT-PCR was performed to detect the presence of viral genes in hiPSC-CMs following exosomal uptake. mRNA levels were measured by qRT-PCR (n = 3, mean \u00b1 S.D.). ***P<0.001 versus pLVX-Blank (Student's t-test). G, Expression of inflammatory genes in hiPSC-CMs. hiPSC-CMs were treated with exosomes released by A549 cells transduced with pLVX-Blank or pLVX-Nsp1 lentiviral particles for 6 hours and mRNA levels were measured by qRT-PCR",
