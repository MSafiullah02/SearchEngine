Among them, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are two highly pathogenic viruses. As with other coronaviruses, the spike glycoprotein (S) homotrimer on the COVID-19 virus surface plays an essential role in receptor binding and virus entry. The S protein is a class I fusion protein\u2014each S protomer consists of S1 and S2 domains (9) with the receptor binding domain (RBD) located on the S1 domain (8). Previous studies revealed that the COVID-19 virus, similarly to SARS-CoV, uses the ACE2 receptor for cell entry (3, 10\u201313). Numerous neutralizing antibodies have been found targeting the RBDs of SARS-CoV or MERS (14\u201316). Therefore, screening for neutralizing antibodies that target the COVID-19 virus RBD is a priority.",

The variable regions encoding the heavy and light chain were each amplified from separate single B cells, and then were cloned into a pCAGGS vector with the constant region to produce IgG1 antibodies as described previously (17). Seventeen paired B cell clones were amplified, three of which were identical (B5, B59 and H1). To identify the antibody binding abilities, the plasmids containing the paired heavy and light chains were co-transfected into HEK 293T cells for monoclonal antibody (MAbs) production. The supernatants were then screened for binding to the RBD by bio-layer interferometry (BLI). An irrelevant anti-SFTSV Gn antibody and a SARS specific antibody were used as controls (18). The supernatants from four different antibodies (B5, B38, H2 and H4) bound to COVID-19 virus RBD, but not to SARS-CoV RBD (fig. S1), suggesting the epitopes of the two RBDs are immunologically distinct. The usage of heavy chain (VH) and light chain (VL) variable genes in these four antibodies are listed in table S1.",

For the BLI assay, streptavidin biosensors labeled with biotinylated RBD were saturated with antibodies, and then the test antibodies were flowed through in the presence of soluble ACE2. B38 and H4 showed complete competition with ACE2 for binding to RBD. In contrast, B5 displayed partial competition, while H2 did not compete with ACE2 for RBD binding (Fig. 1, E to H). The blocking assay by FACS presented the same result (Fig. 1I). To determine whether B38 and H4 target the same epitope, we performed an epitope competition assay by BLI. The Ni-NTA sensor labeled with the RBD was saturated with B38 IgG and H4 IgG was flowed through, or the sensor was first saturated with H4 IgG and B38 IgG was flowed through. Although RBD was saturated with the first antibody, the second antibody could still bind to RBD, but with some inhibition. This suggests that B38 and H4 recognize different epitopes on RBD with partial overlap (Fig. 1, J and K).",

The body weight of B38 group decreased slowly and recovered at 3 days post infection (dpi) compared with the PBS control group and the H4 group (Fig. 3A). The number of viral RNA copies in the lung were also measured at 3 dpi. The RNA copies of both B38 group and H4 group were significantly lower than the PBS group, with a reduction of 32.8% and 26%, respectively (Fig. 3B). These results show the same trends as the neutralization abilities. Histopathological examination indicated that severe bronchopneumonia and interstitial pneumonia can be observed in the mice of PBS control group, with edema and bronchial epithelia cell desquamation and infiltration of lymphocytes within alveolar spaces (Fig. 3, C and F). Mild bronchopneumonia was observed in the H4 group (Fig. 3, E and H), while no lesions were observed in the B38 group (Fig. 3, D and G).",

Complex crystal structure of RBD-B38 Fab was solved at 1.9 \u00c5 resolution (table S2). Three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) on the heavy chain and two CDRs on the light chain are involved in interaction with RBD (Fig. 4, A, B, and G to K). The buried surface area of heavy and light chain on the epitope is 713.9 \u00c5 and 497.7 \u00c5, respectively. There are 36 residues in the RBD involved in the interaction with B38, in which 21 residues and 15 residues interact with heavy and light chain, respectively (table S3 and Fig. 4B). Sequence alignment indicates that only 15 of the 36 residues in the epitope (defined as residues buried by B38) are conserved between COVID-19 virus and SARS-CoV (Fig. 4, D to F, and fig. S3). Notably, most contacts in the interface between B38 and RBD are hydrophilic interactions (table S4). Water molecules play important role in the binding between COVID-19 RBD and B38 (Fig. 4, G and I to K). These difference explain the B38 specific binding to COVID-19 rather than SARS-CoV.",
