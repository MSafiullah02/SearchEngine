            "text": "Influenza is a highly contagious and epidemic respiratory disease caused by type A influenza virus, which has many subtypes with respect to two surface glycoproteins, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Four influenza pandemics have occurred since 1918 ( Webby and Webster, 2003, Lessler et al., 2010). In addition to the currently circulating human viruses of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, avian influenza viruses of H5N1, H7N7 and H7N9 subtypes also caused lethal human infections (Subbarao et al., 1998, Fouchier et al., 2004, Zhu et al., 2013). A very recent report showed that the virus of H6N1 subtype is able to cause human infection (Wei et al., 2013). Four anti-influenza viral drugs, amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir, and oseltamivir are used for treatment of influenza virus infection. These drugs may reduce the length of the illness and the severity of symptoms, but adverse side effects and an emergence of viruses resistant to these drugs are reported (Deyde et al., 2007, Meijer et al., 2009). Therefore, new drugs with greater efficacy and better tolerability than existing treatments are urgently needed for treatment of influenza virus infection.",

At concentration of 100 \u03bcg/ml or less, PSE had no significant cytotoxicity on DF-cells. Next, the antiviral activity of PSE was evaluated. Microscopic examination showed that DF-1 cells infected with H6N1 virus showed cytopathic effects including rounding, detachment and death of the cells (Fig. 1B). Treatment of DF-1 cells with 100 \u03bcg/ml PSE significantly reduced the CPE produced by the virus (Fig. 1B).

Hence, new approaches for the control of infection with influenza viruses must be explored. Traditional Chinese medicinal herbs may be a potential alternative medicine of choice for treatment of this disease. Recently, a number of clinical trials of traditional Chinese medicines for influenza have been conducted (Wang et al., 2011, Nabeshima et al., 2012, Jiang et al., 2013;). Data presented in this study show that PSE is a potent inhibitor of the viral growth in chicken fibroblast DF-1 cells. Further, PSE had low toxicity and low effective concentration against H6N1 influenza virus. The CC50 and EC50 value of PSE were 262.8 \u03bcg/ml and 34.8 \u03bcg/ml, respectively, and the selected index (SI) value was 7.6 (SI=CC50/EC50).",

In the current study, three flavonoid compounds, scutellarein, luteolin and apigenin, were identified in PSE. Scutellarein has been shown to be a strong inhibitor of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus helicase, and may serve as an important resource for the future development of anti-SARS medications (Keum and Jeong, 2012). Apigenin and luteolin are previously shown to inhibit influenza A virus neuraminidases ( Liu et al., 2008, Grienke et al., 2012), and they can effectively reduce neuraminidase activity of H5N1 virus (Sithisarn et al., 2013). In this study, the PSE-mediated inhibition of the growth of influenza virus H6N1 might also be due to anti-influenza viral effects from apigenin and luteolin. However, additional studies are necessary to identify the possible correlation between biological activities and chemical composition of PSE to ensure the appropriate medicinal use of this medicinal herb.",
