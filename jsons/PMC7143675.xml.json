When this occurs patients will often need ICU and broadly account for about 30% of admissions according to the patient population. This will impact on the type of septic problems such as community-acquired infection versus nosocomial or hospital-acquired infection. A medical ICU will have far more community-acquired infections than an ICU admitting elective surgical patients. Whatever the source, infection leading to sepsis remains a major intensive care problem that has a mortality of at least 38%.1\n",

It is common to see young patients who would have an ejection fraction (EF) of >50% having an EF of <30%. Post-event the cardiac function recovers. They do not have ischaemic or valvular heart disease. Baron showed that 60% of patients ventilated with septic shock showed impaired LV function which was partially correctable with dobutamine. There was functional recovery and it did not affect survival.10 Echo will also show right ventricular dysfunction which carries a much worse prognosis and influences the CVP readings. Simple measures of LV dimensions can guide filling requirements. Measuring the inferior vena cava (IVC) in response to fluid challenges and respiratory variation adds to the information on filling. In over 80% of patients this information can be obtained by transthoracic echo.",

However, noradrenaline has the most favourable profile in the event of sepsis and adequate filling pressures. Vasopressin appears as second choice as it has been shown that plasma levels are low in septic patients. Adrenaline is the first choice inotrope with dobutamine second, which has tended to replace dopamine. Adrenaline should be considered alongside noradrenaline but cannot be used outside of intensive care and when central venous access is not available.
