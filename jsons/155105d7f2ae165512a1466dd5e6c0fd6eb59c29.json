ACE2 encodes angiotensin converting enzyme subtype 2, which has important compensatory roles in modulating excessive activation of the RAAS as occurs in hypertension (HTN), congestive heart failure (CHF), and atherosclerosis. In its soluble form, ACE2 acts as a carboxypeptidase cleaving the pro-hypertrophic polypeptides angiotensin I and angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-9 and angiotensin 1-7 respectively, thereby producing counter-regulating, vasodilating, and potentially anti-hypertrophic/anti-fibrotic polypeptides ( Figure 3C) . 19 Accordingly, we speculate that up-regulation of both ACE2 transcript and ACE2 protein levels might be a compensatory, counter-regulatory signaling response ('patho-responsive') in patients with obstructive HCM. This was echoed in a recent paper by Liu et al. in which the investigators studied the transcriptome of HCM mouse models and found that pro-fibrotic pathways initiated by increase of endothelin-1(ET1) were the main drivers of HCM pathogenesis in mice through miRNA-29 and TGF\u03b2 signaling. However, using our preliminary microarray data that was derived from the patients in our study and made publicly available (GSE36961), this differential expression of the TGF\u03b2-signaling genes was not observed. Instead, the increased transcript levels of ACE2 were noted prompting the speculation that ACE2 overexpression might be a compensatory response. 20 Lastly, ACE2, located in the X-chromosome, was upregulated significantly in female patients with HCM (1.33 fold compared to males: p<0.01), and while only one gene, findings like these could start to shed light and form the basis to understanding some of the underlying (epigenetic) contributions to the significantly different outcomes that are observed for women with HCM.

However, expression in cardiomyocytes is quite low. In fact, in a study of cardiac cell samples from donor hearts, both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 showed highest expression in the heart tissue's pericyte sub-population rather than in the cardiomyocytes. 28 Nevertheless, widespread expression of ACE2 may contribute to multi-organ dysfunction seen in patients with 30 The marked 5-fold increase in ACE2 protein in HCM may provide a mechanism to explain higher rates of severe outcomes in COVID19 patients who also have cardiovascular comorbidities, as well as the direct cardiac damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections.

This viral internalization may result in loss of membrane ACE2 and a subsequent increase in the Angiotensin II:Ang (1-7) ratio, which in turn allows excessive angiotensin II and unopposed angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R)-mediated lung injury in patients with COVID-19 and the development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 24, 25",

Based on the significantly increased expression of membrane-bound ACE2 in HCM hearts, we speculate that obstructive HCM, and perhaps other ACE2-generating heart diseases, sensitizes the myocardium to increased SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and subsequent viral replication, while the subsequent decrease of surface ACE2 (after viral internalization) leads to increase of damaging angiotensin II and AT1R activity and loss of the protective effects of Ang(1-7) (Figure 3). Just recently, Liu et al. proposed a similar hypothesis, describing the resulting unopposed increase of angiotensin II and subsequent downstream increase of detrimental inflammation, reactive oxygen species, vasoconstriction, and thrombosis as the basis for cardiac damage stemming from SARS-CoV-2 infection. 34",

Importantly, the single most up-regulated gene in the cardiac transcriptome for patients with obstructive HCM was ACE2. Further, the proven 5-fold increase in ACE2 protein levels in the heart may shedlight on the increased morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases. However, it remains to be demonstrated whether non-obstructive HCM, other cardiomyopathies, other acquired cardiovascular diseases, or hypertension precipitate an overexpression of ACE2 protein in the heart as shown here for obstructive HCM. Whether an angiotensin receptor blocker like losartan or delivery of an ACE2 decoy with human recombinant soluble ACE2 might be effective therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 patients with Top up-regulated and down-regulated genes in HCM.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus hijacks membrane-bound ACE2 for cellular entry. Aside from allowing cellular invasion and viral replication, internalization of the SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 complex causes a decrease of surface ACE2. Loss of surface ACE2 i) increases the angiotensin II:angiotensin (1-7) ratio and ii) increases angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) activity with a resultant increase in damaging angiotensin II activity. Shown are potential therapeutic targets (and clinical trials) using either angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs, losartan specifically) or human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2). For patients with ACE2-accentuating heart diseases like obstructive HCM, the speculated increase in viral infectivity of the heart muscle remains to be proven.

HCM samples were obtained from mostly Caucasian subjects (54 the myectomy samples showed moderate or severe interstitial fibrosis in 27%, and moderate or severe endocardial fibrosis in 63% of patients.From the donor hearts, 39 of 44 RNA samples passed RNA and microarray quality control and were used for microarray analyses. These 39 donors included 19 men and 20 women, with an average age of 37 \u00b1 15 years, approximately 10 years younger than HCM cases(Table 1). variants were identified in 55% of HCM cohort. In approximately 45% of subjects (48/106), the 13-gene test panel did not identify the cause for HCM. As anticipated, mutations in MYBPC3 (encoding cardiac myosin binding protein C) and MYH7 (encoding beta myosin heavy chain) genes were the most commonly identified (23/106; 22% and 17/106; 16%, respectively). Clinical parameters of the patients with HCM, based on the two largest genotype groups (MYBPC3+ and MYH7+) are shown inTable 2. These two groups were similar but differed from genotype-negative HCM patients by younger age at diagnosis and myectomy, and higher prevalence of familial HCM, similarly to prior larger studies.4,[13][14][15] There was no difference in NYHA classification, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, ejection fraction, left ventricular mass index, left ventricular wall thickness, left ventricular outflow tract maximum instantaneous gradient, or interstitial or endocardial fibrosis among the three primary genotypic subgroups (MHY7+, MYBPC3+, and genotype negative-HCM).",
