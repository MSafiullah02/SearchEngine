However, a second peak can be also reported between spring and early summer, as occurred in our geographical area [7]. The circulation of the different EV types is variable from one year to another. Furthermore, while in some regions an EV might be endemic, in others it might be the aetiological agent of limited sporadic outbreaks [8]. The EV surveillance has been reinforced from 2014 and on due to EV-D68 and EV-A71 outbreaks in North America and Europe, respectively [9,10].",

Upper RTI (URTI) included those respiratory infections from the nose to the larynx, excluding HFMD and herpangina. Lower RTI (LRTI) included recurrent wheezing, asthma, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia; LRTI severity was studied in patients requiring admission due to the RTI, to ensure that the length of hospital stay or the respiratory support were only related to the disease. Aseptic meningitis was defined as an inflammatory process of the leptomeninges causing signs and symptoms indicative of meningeal irritation, with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study characterised by pleocytosis, normal or increased protein levels, and the absence of microorganisms on Gram stain and on routine culture. Rhombencephalitis was referred to inflammatory diseases affecting the hindbrain (brainstem and cerebellum), causing dysfunction of these structures, with normal or elevated leukocyte count in CSF. Typical magnetic resonance (MR) findings were considered in the diagnostic confirmation of rhombencephalitis, with the isolation of EV in respiratory samples. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), AFP is defined as a sudden onset of paralysis/weakness in one or more limbs of a child <15 years old with the absence or decreased myotatic reflexes.",

For samples received between October 2014 and November 2016, an additional real-time RT-PCR (Seegene, Korea) was performed to improve the detection of all EVs due to the inaccurate detection of some EVs, as previously described [11].

Purified PCR products were sequenced using the ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit v3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) on the ABI PRISM 3130XL Genetic Analyser (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Nucleotide sequences were edited and assembled using MEGA v5.2 [13] and preliminarily analysed by the Enterovirus Genotyping web-based Tool [14]. A multiple alignment of sequences together with reference sequences to EV types belonging to the four species (EV-A, -B, -C, and -D) downloaded from NCBI GenBank (Supplementary Table 1) was performed using the MUSCLE software in MEGA v5.2 [13]. Prior to phylogenetic analysis, the molecular evolutionary models of nucleotide substitutions were fitted to the multiple sequence alignments using evolutionary analysis, conducted in MEGA v5.2 [13]. The phylogenetic trees were constructed using a neighbor-joining distance method as implemented in MEGA v5.2 with the evolutionary model with the lowest Bayesian information criterion score [13]. The topological accuracy of the internal branch was evaluated by the bootstrap method (1000 replicates).",

Nonetheless, in the European region, a study reported a very low rate (2%), mainly associated with mild disease, with few severe cases [8]. The EV-D68 circulation was also low (32/5703; 0.6%) in the present study, although it showed a higher detection rate during 2016, like other Spanish reports [1,19] as well as during the current year 2018 in our hospital and recently reported data (October 2018) from the European Non-Polio Enterovirus Network (unpublished data). Regarding the clinical manifestations, most of EV-D68 detected were associated with LRTI, highlighting its possible association with severe respiratory illnesses [20]. Similarly to other European cases [21,22], only one case, a 2-year-old girl, developed AFP in February 2016 [15]. EV-D68 usually causes more severe disease in patients with asthma or reactive airway, as previously reported [23,24], but herein only one case was reported. Therefore, due to the relatedness of EV-D68 infection to severity, non-polio EV surveillance has been enhanced, and since EV-D68 has a predominant respiratory tropism, respiratory specimens should be studied to monitor EV-D68 circulation [25].",

Neurologic manifestations of EV-A71 mainly occurred in children <5 years old and rhombencephalitis was the most common neurologic presentation, but the EV-A71 detection at hospital level might be underestimated because of the severity of the disease. A question which really remained unanswered was whether EV-A71 simultaneously circulated in the community during the outbreak, but related to mild diseases such as HFMD or herpangina, and hence, attended at the Primary Care Centres. Likewise, CV-A6 is well-known to cause HFMD [26], and it could have circulated in the community during the study period. However, CV-A6 was not frequently detected in our series (11/210), maybe due to the mildness of the disease that does not require to go to the hospital. A recent French study conducted an ambulatory clinic-based surveillance to report the underestimation of EV detected only in hospitals [27].",
