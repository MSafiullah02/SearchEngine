It can also provide some separation between children who may have a contagious disease and elderly adults, who are very susceptible to these illnesses. It is important to childproof the waiting room by avoiding sharp corners on chairs and tables, locking cabinets, covering electrical outlets, and covering trash cans.19 If pediatric-size furniture is available, it is important to keep it clean after use.

Additional pediatric QI indicators can include pediatric resuscitations, intubations, and patients admitted to the general pediatric ward who require transfer to a pediatric intensive care unit. More specific QI ideas can include timing to administration of antipyretics, or pain assessment and management.23 It is important to include some out-of-hospital QI indicators such as appropriate airway management (airway adjunct or assisted ventilation), delivery of 100% oxygen to a child in respiratory distress, establishment of vascular access, appropriate immobilization for trauma, and appropriate sized equipment used. The Institute of Health Care Improvement has defined the four essential components of a high-performing quality program as follows: (1) focus on identifying appropriate indicators, developing a plan for improvement (plan); (2) implement this plan (do); (3) collect and analyze the data (study); and (4) reach conclusions and make recommendations (act). It is also important to have a multidisciplinary QI team, as different perspectives will be obtained and many lessons learned (see Chapter 149, Patient Safety, Medical Errors, and Quality of Care).",

The decision to transfer pediatric patients depends upon the ED and hospital capabilities, but guidelines have been developed to help physicians identify which patients would benefit from specialized care. It is important for the referring physician to consult with the receiving physician, so the appropriate method of transport and the required personnel can be determined.

It can also mean that, even after an ill or injured child has been stabilized, there may be no available beds at the pediatric centers. While there are no easy solutions to this problem, utilizing QI indicators to track time on EMS diversion, ED boarding time, ED waiting room time, the number of patients who left without being seen, and the number of times when patients could not be transferred in a timely manner will help those outside the ED realize there is a problem, and help advocate for change.",
