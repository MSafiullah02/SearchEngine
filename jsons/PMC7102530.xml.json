However, viral clearance was observed in only a small proportion of patients in ICU. Therefore, the clinical progression in these severe cases may not fit this biphasic model. Indeed, patients admitted to ICU were unable to defervesce without corticosteroid therapy or had significantly longer duration of fever compared with those in the non-ICU group.

Therefore, clinical outcomes in these patients were not available and continued observations are still needed. Second, we did not test SARS-CoV-2 daily for everybody. Hence, the actual duration to viral clearance should be shorter than the estimated one. Meanwhile, we did not quantify the viral load of the SARS-CoV-2 and false negative of the PCR result for upper respiratory sample has also been reported.15 For that reason, studies on the dynamic changes of the viral load are still warranted.",
