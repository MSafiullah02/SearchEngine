By contrast, mice that are immunodeficient, such as those with a genetic disruption of recombination activation gene 1 (RAG1\u2212/\u2212) or mice with severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID), do not develop demyelination despite harboring large virus titers Houtman and Fleming, 1996a, Wang et al., 1990, Wu and Perlman, 1999. These mice die from viral encephalitis 14\u201316 days post-inoculation (p.i.) without protection from T cells or antibodies. Adoptive transfer of CD4 or CD8 T cells from immunocompetent mice into MHV-infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 or SCID mice results in inflammation and demyelination within 7 days post-transfer (p.t.). Macrophage/microglia recruitment and concomitant demyelination occur rapidly after adoptive transfer Wu et al., 2000, Wu and Perlman, 1999, in large part because pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) of RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice even in the absence of transferred T cells (Haring et al., 2002).",

Using MHC class I tetramers and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), a large fraction of CNS-derived T cells has been determined to be MHV-specific in immunocompetent mice infected with MHV and after adoptive transfer of T cells into infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice Haring et al., 2001, Marten et al., 2000a, Marten et al., 2000b, Pewe and Perlman, 1999. Despite these sensitive methods of identifying antigen-specific T cells, populations of T cells with unknown specificities exist in the CNS after MHV infection. Although as yet undetermined viral epitopes may be recognized by some of these T cells, some T cells in the MHV-infected CNS are likely not to be MHV-specific. Some of these T cells could be autoreactive, as detected in the CNS of mice with demyelination induced by Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) (Miller et al., 1997), but autoreactive cells have only rarely been detected in the MHV-infected CNS (Watanabe et al., 1983).",

Little is known about the trafficking of bystander T cells into sites of inflammation, if they are important in resolution of infections, or if they participate in immune-mediated pathology. In a recent study, we demonstrated that activated bystander CD8 T cells were efficient mediators of demyelination in MHV-infected mice (Haring et al., 2002). Using two distinct CD8 TCR transgenic mouse strains, both on a RAG2\u2212/\u2212 background (P14 and N15), we showed that CD8 T cells with no reactivity to MHV- or CNS-derived antigens could mediate significant demyelination, but only if the T cells were activated either with cognate peptide plus adjuvant, or by infection of the transgenic mice with virus containing the cognate peptide. The amount of demyelination caused by bystander CD8 T cells was approximately one-third to one-half the amount mediated by MHV-specific CD8 T cells at a similar time post infection with MHV (Wu et al., 2000). The presence of demyelination correlated with increased numbers of activated bystander CD8 T cells, as measured by ICS for interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), in the CNS at the time of peak disease. These results provide strong evidence that activated bystander CD8 T cells are capable of participating in immunopathology.",

Herein, we used TCLi/RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice to investigate if bystander CD4 T cells, like bystander CD8 T cells (Haring et al., 2002), participate in the process of immune-mediated demyelination.

Previously, we also demonstrated that activated bystander CD8 T cells are capable of mediating demyelination after infection with MHV (Haring et al., 2002). In the current study, we assessed the ability of bystander CD4 T cells to participate in immune-mediated demyelination using TCLi/RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice, which contain only CD4 T cells specific for a peptide derived from the human CLIP fragment and are thus not specific for MHV-derived epitopes. We analyzed spinal cords for myelin damage after infection of TCLi/RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice with MHV with or without activation of TCLi CD4 T cells with cognate peptide (hCLIP85). Analysis of spinal cords from MHV-infected TCLi/RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice 14 days p.i. revealed the presence of low levels of demyelination, equivalent to those observed in MHV-infected non-transgenic RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice at this same time p.i. (Fig. 1\n, Table 1). To determine if highly activated bystander CD4 T cells were capable of causing demyelination, spinal cords were harvested from TCLi/RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice treated with 100 \u03bcg hCLIP85:CFA 3 days prior to infection with MHV. The clinical diseases in infected TCLi/RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice that were untreated or treated with peptide/CFA were indistinguishable, with all mice showing signs of encephalitis (hunching, lethargy and ruffled fur). Analysis of spinal cords from peptide-treated, infected TCLi mice day 14 p.i. revealed no demyelination above background levels (Fig. 1, Table 1). These results indicate that, unlike activated bystander CD8 T cells, bystander CD4 T cells were unable to mediate demyelination after infection of the CNS with MHV.",

We detected no sequence homology between peptide hCLIP85 and MHV by computer analysis, excluding an obvious explanation for potential observed recruitment of TCLi cells into the CNS.

As shown in Fig. 2A\nand Table 1, only a small number of TCLi T cells were recruited into the CNS after MHV infection alone. CD4+ T cells constituted 1% of the leukocytes isolated from the brains of infected TCLi/RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice, equivalent to approximately 2000 TCLi cells per MHV-infected brain (Table 1).

Together, these results suggest that MHV-specific T cells in the CNS produce factors, as yet unidentified, that are necessary for the recruitment of bystander CD4 T cells and that are not present at sufficient levels without the transfer of additional T cells. Highly activated CD4 T cells appear capable of trafficking into the inflamed CNS without the aid of these putative factors.",

Minimal bystander activation of TCLi T cells was observed after MHV infection alone (Fig. 3A\n, Table 2). In mice treated with hCLIP85:CFA prior to infection, a large fraction (25%, equivalent to approximately 6000 cells/brain; Table 2) of CNS-derived TCLi T cells produced IFN-\u03b3 in response to stimulation with cognate peptide (Fig. 3C, Table 2) in the absence of adoptive transfer of MHV-immune cells. After adoptive transfer of undepleted splenocytes from MHV-immune mice, very few TCLi cells responded to stimulation with cognate peptide by making IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 3E) despite the presence of a large number of activated MHV-specific T cells (Fig. 3G,I and Table 2). Thus, we observed no functional activation of bystander CD4 T cells in the absence of cognate antigen.",

Although no clear mechanism for this inability has been elucidated, it is most likely a result of the difference in the mechanisms by which CD4 and CD8 T cells mediate demyelination. MHV-infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice that received adoptive transfer of CD8 T cell-enriched splenocytes from an MHV-immune donor underwent a protracted disease course. These mice survived >11 days p.t. and developed overwhelming demyelination, approaching 40% of the spinal cord. In contrast, recipients of CD4 T cell-enriched splenocytes became moribund within 6\u20137 days p.t. and exhibited significantly less demyelination (approximately 10% of the spinal cord) (Wu et al., 2000). These data indicate that MHV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells cause demyelination by mechanisms that are not completely overlapping. The putative effector function(s) missing from bystander CD4 T cells, which resulted in the inability to cause demyelination, has not been identified. Using a panel of probes for chemokines and cytokines, we have been unable to identify any factors that are critical for demyelination Haring et al., 2002, Pewe et al., 2002, Pewe and Perlman, 2002. Our results suggest that macrophage/microglia recruitment or activation is crucial for demyelination to occur. Future studies will be directed at understanding these processes after adoptive transfer of MHV-specific and non MHV-specific T cells.",

IFN-\u03b3 production was not necessary, however, for CD4 T cell-mediated demyelination after adoptive transfer (Pewe et al., 2002). The ability of myelin-specific CD8 T cells to induce demyelination was also dependent on IFN-\u03b3 production by these cells in another animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Huseby et al., 2001). The mechanisms downstream of IFN-\u03b3 that ultimately lead to the development of demyelination in either model are unknown. Several possible mechanisms exist, including the increased production by glia of chemokines involved in the recruitment of additional inflammatory cells into the CNS, or the upregulation of antigen presenting molecules on resident cells of the CNS, which may increase the ability of MHV-infected cells to be recognized by incoming T cells.

Infection of RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice with MHV resulted in the expression of several chemokines including MIP-2, MCP-3, MIP-1\u03b2, MCP-1, IP-10 and RANTES (Haring et al., 2002), which were likely to contribute to the inflammatory process. After adoptive transfer of MHV-specific T cells, recruitment of bystander CD4 T cells was increased. This increase may reflect enhanced production of chemokines, such as RANTES and IP-10 in the CNS after adoptive transfer of CD4 T cell-enriched splenocytes (Pewe et al., 2002). IP-10, Mig and RANTES are all required for maximal mononuclear cell infiltration into the CNS of MHV-infected immunocompetent mice Lane et al., 2000, Liu et al., 2000, Liu et al., 2001a. Continuous production of IP-10 is also required for maximal inflammation during chronic infection since neutralization of this chemokine resulted in significantly decreased T cell recruitment into the MHV-infected CNS (Liu et al., 2001b).",

One study, using mice transgenic for an LCMV-specific TCR infected with vaccinia virus (VV), suggested that bystander activation of naive CD8 T cells occurred at low levels. However, Welsh and co-workers, in subsequent studies, showed that this was due to the activation of T cells with dual reactivity to LCMV and a second virus (VV or Pichinde (PV)). Only T cells responding to a subset of LCMV-specific epitopes were elicited by VV or PV. Notably, the anti-LCMV CD8 T cell response elicited by VV was protective against subsequent challenge with LCMV Brehm et al., 2002, Selin et al., 1994, Selin et al., 1998. Also consistent with the specificity of the cross-reactive response, mice doubly transgenic for pancreatic expression of the LCMV gp and for an LCMV gp-specific T cell receptor did not develop diabetes after infection with VV. However, infection with LCMV did result in diabetes, indicating that a response with the correct specificity was able to cause disease (Ehl et al., 1997).",

However, HSK lesions occurred with greater frequency and severity if the bystander CD4 T cells were activated prior to infection Deshpande et al., 2001, Gangappa et al., 1999. These results were similar to those obtained in our previous study of demyelination mediated by bystander CD8 T cells, although we were unable to detect bystander activation in that study (Haring et al., 2002). Together, these results suggest that bystander activation is uncommon. If activated by cognate antigen, however, bystander CD4 and CD8 T cells are capable of mediating immunopathological changes.",
