Among 8,396 respiratory specimens studied, 87 (1%) clinical samples were positive for HCoVs, of which 50 samples (0.6% of the total) were positive for HCoV-OC43, 15 (0.2%) for HCoV-229E, 14 (0.2%) for HCoV-HKU1, and 8 (0.1%) for HCoV-NL63. The prevalence of HCoV infection in adults exhibited distinct seasonal fluctuations during the study period. In addition, patients positive for HCoV-229E infections were more likely to be coinfected with other respiratory viruses. Enterovirus, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza virus type 3 were the most common viruses found in patients with HCoV infections.

Virol. 83:291-297, 2011 . \u00df 2010 INTRODUCTION Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses with large positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes. They cause a wide range of illnesses including respira-tory tract infections, diarrhea, and disorders of the central nervous system in birds, humans, and other mammals [Holmes, 2001] . Based on genome sequence and serology, CoVs can be divided into three distinct groups, I, II, and III. Human CoVs (HCoVs) belong to group I and II [Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Woo et al., 2009 ]. The first two identified HCoVs were HCoV 229E and OC43 [Tyrrell and Bynoe, 1965; Hamre and Procknow, 1966; McIntosh et al., 1967] .",

Our results for infection rates of OC43 and 229E are different from those of previous reports, which may be due to the geographic location and the alternating pattern of viral seasonality in our study. This study indicates that in China, OC43 infections peaked every other year, whereas 229E appeared every other year. Furthermore, OC43 was found mainly in summer and early autumn, and only a few cases appeared in November (winter season) 2008, whereas 229E was detected mainly in spring and summer.

NL63 peaked in autumn as reported by others [Lau et al., 2006; Leung et al., 2009] but was absent in spring. Therefore, the seasonal pattern of NL63 infection appears to be similar to that of 229E.

            "text": "In summary, this study reports a large-scale, detailed analysis of the prevalence and clinical presentations of different HCoV infections in adults with acute respiratory tract infections in Beijing, China during the period 2005 to 2009. All known HCoVs, including the recently identified HKU1 and NL63 strains, were detected in adults with acute respiratory tract infections. The results from this study should help to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of HCoVs and provide information for evaluating the disease burden in clinics and disease control policies. However, given that the study population was limited and the number of HCoV-positive samples studied was low, future investigations are needed to characterize the infections of the various HCoVs in adults more thoroughly.",
