This pathogen is responsible for causing Canine Monocytic Ehrlichiosis (CME) in canines and probably in felines, globally. It is transmitted exclusively by the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (Dumler et al., 2001). E. canis has a tissue tropism for reticulo-endothelial cells of the liver, spleen and lymph nodes and replicates primarily in the mononuclear macrophages (Swango et al., 1989). The disease is often referred to as \u2018tropical canine pancytopaenia\u2019, because of its high prevalence rates in tropics and subtropical zones with associated decrease in leucocytes and platelets in clinical cases. In absence of timely therapeutic interventions, the disease pathophysiology continues and the mononuclear cell invasions results into various severe clinical and fatal outcomes (Gal et al., 2008).",

Besides these serological assays, two of the pen-side serological kits viz. Immunocomb dot-ELISA test (Biogal Galed Laboratories, Israel) and SNAP3Dx assay (IDEXX Laboratories, USA) utilizing synthetic peptides derived from major immuno-dominant E. canis proteins are also commercially available for the field use (Harrus et al., 2002). Presently, molecular tools like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing are considered to be more sensitive methods for detection and characterization of E. canis (Harrus et al., 1998a, Harrus et al., 2004).",

Besides these lacunae, these prevalence studies were also solely based on either commercial serology kit or on molecular based techniques and thus failed to analyse the practical relevance of both the methodologies in existing field conditions. These points are quite pertinent from the fact that nowadays there has been lot of awareness on control measures viz. anti-tick/acaricide applications and recommended doxycycline therapy against the disease. At present, working dogs being housed in organised kennels also form a key corpus of dog population in this country and due to intensive way of housing; these dogs are unrelentingly on the high risk of acquiring CME. With this background, this study was envisaged to correlate the haematological parameters, serum biochemistry profiles and histopathology findings of canine ehrlichiosis cases along with their diagnostic assays results. These lab findings were then thoroughly analysed so as to bridge the existing knowledge gap on the actual scenario of CME in the organised kennels of this country.",

A sizeable population of working dogs in India principally comprise of Labrador Retriever and German Shepherd breeds. Deployment of these working dogs in difficult terrains like grassland and forests posses a potential exposure to the infected wild canids; while carrying out duties in semi-urban or rural areas these animals get exposed to the stray dogs. Thus, these working dogs are also at the continuous risk of exposure to ticks and other tick borne diseases. With this background, present study was undertaken simultaneously using, microscopy, dot-ELISA and nested PCR. These diagnostic results were then retrospectively correlated with clinical manifestations, haematology parameters, biochemical profiles and clinico-pathological findings of the clinical cases so as to have an actual view of CME existing in the organised kennels of this country.",

Moreover, sensitivity of E. canis detection by microscopy is low due to the fact that in chronic cases number of infected cells in peripheral circulation is very less to be detected by microscopic examination.

            "text": "Present study also revealed a greater number (43) of sero-positive samples vis-\u00e0-vis 13 nested PCR positive cases. Three PCR positive dogs were sero-negative by dot ELISA. Thus, 23.25% sero-positive canines were nested PCR positive, while only 4.65% sero-positives were positive by microscopy. Parana da Silva Souza et al. (2010) had also observed that 34.5% IFAT positive dogs were PCR positive for E. canis. Wen et al. (1997) reported 16S rRNA nested PCR as highly specific and sensitive method for detection of E. canis DNA from blood samples. Nested PCR protocol has been claimed to be comparable 0.2 pg to of E. canis DNA by Southern blotting. Harrus et al. (1998b) had reported that serology based diagnostic assays like indirect immunofluorescence antibody test are not reliable methods to determine persistence of infection or success of treatment as titres have been shown to remain high for long periods even after elimination of the parasite. In contrast, very recent acute condition may not generate enough antibodies sufficient enough to be detected by serology. This phenomenon was observed with two sera samples found to be negative by dot-ELISA (titre 1:20) but judged positive for E. canis by microscopy and nested PCR. Alternately, chronic infections may result in negative results with serology. This may be due to pancytopenia and bone marrow failure (Saito and Walker, 2016). E. canis DNA in infected dog blood can be detected earlier than serum antibodies, while the latter continue to persist even after doxycycline therapy (Moroff et al., 2014). Moreover, cross reactivity between different Ehrlichia spp. makes the definitive sero-diagnosis of E. canis difficult. Furthermore, cases with sero-positive and negative nested PCR may also be an indication of the carrier state or subclinical infection due to sequestration of the parasite in the splenic macrophages (Harrus et al., 1998a, Harrus et al., 1998b, Waner, 2008). Nakaghi et al. (2008) did not observe any significant difference between the results IFAT kit (VMRD Inc., USA) and dot-ELISA kit (Biogal Galed Laboratories, Israel), though the latter detected more sero-positives (70% by ELISA versus 63.3% by IFAT). In light of observed facts, it is emphasized that serological assays (dot-ELISA) without confirmation by molecular assay (nested PCR) may lead to biased results, as cross reactivity among Ehrlichia species and persistence of antibodies for long periods in dogs even after their successful treatment may result in reporting of false positive cases. This possibility leads to the overestimation of CME in a region/country under study. The same was also observed in our study, where a greater number (43) of sero-positive samples (19.1% of sero-prevalence) vis-\u00e0-vis 13 nested PCR positive cases (5.8% of molecular prevalence) was recorded in a fixed set of a dog population. Thus, the serological results should be interpreted with caution and should be complemented by nested PCR results so as to avoid misdiagnosis.",

Ehrlichia chaffensis, Anaplasma platys and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Nair et al., 2016). It is thus beyond doubt that CME due to E. canis results in marked anaemia due to significant decrease in PCV, TRBC and haemoglobin (gm/dl). But over the last decade, there has been lot of awareness on canine ehrlichiosis in organised kennels and stringent management practices have helped to reduce the incidence and prevalence of the disease. As per our observations, most veterinarians in India prescribe doxycycline at recommended dose along with supportive B-vitamins and iron supplementations for treatment of minor ailments like pyrexia or as chemo-prophylaxis, especially during the tick season. It is expected that due to widespread application of doxycycline, CME is no more a real potent threat to dogs in organised kennels of this country as it used to be, in spite of its high prevalence. This may be one of the reasons that no severe chronic case of ehrlichiosis was encountered during the entire study period. From the interpretation derived from clinical presentation of clinical CME cases with their haematological and biochemical profile pictures it was inferred in this study that severe form of chronic ehrlichiosis is not very common in the organised kennels of this country. Thus keeping in view of endemic status of CME in this country and sub-clinical state of infection it is recommended prevalence studies should also involve screening of apparently healthy dogs.",

Though authors did not observe such serious cases of CME alone and the cases with grave prognosis were observed in only cases affected with mixed infections. Three dogs out of the six animals having dual infection of E. canis and B. gibsoni succumbed to death while no casualty solely because E. canis could be incriminated during the entire course of this study. Changes in various organs like spleen, liver, kidney and lungs were similar to earlier studies carried out by de Castro et al. (2004) and Welzl et al. (2001). Nevertheless, continuous exposure to tick vector and due to lack of timely treatment chronic ehrlichiosis may be encountered in stray dogs as reported by other researchers from India (Abd Rani et al., 2011, Bhadesiya and Raval, 2015).",

However, for developing diagnostics and vaccines for E. canis multi-locus sequence typing of the pathogens along with other associated pathogens like A. platys which have been reported from this country must be carried out. E. canis is considered to have a limited host range among canines and to some extent among felids. Nucleic acid of E. canis has been detected from human beings in Venezuela (Unver et al., 2001) as well from ruminants (ovines) in Turkey and South Africa (Parzy et al., 2009). However pathogen has not been isolated from any human subject till date but raises concerns over \u2018One-Health\u2019 issues. Wider host range and the similarity among the geographically distinct isolates indicate a global spread of the pathogen and its vectors (Parzy et al., 2009). These hint at zoonotic potential of E. canis and its potential ability to cross species barrier of both hosts and vectors, though human infections are considered to be rare and accidental (McQuiston et al., 2003).",

The disease manifests in various forms and its diagnosis by conventional microscopy is prone to errors and insufficiency. Regrettably, due to prerequisites of sophisticated technical resources and higher cost elements for PCR and serological assays, practising veterinarians mostly carry out an empirical treatment leading to indiscriminate use of doxycycline and raising concerns on possibilities of positive selection of drug resistant strain of E. canis. It is suggested that doxycycline should be used with caution only when there is active infection in the affected dogs. Thus, practising vets need to be supported strongly by sound diagnostic services to ascertain the status of CME in clinical cases. The present study concludes with the recommendation that researchers/clinicians should not solely rely on clinical signs and smear microscopy/serological methods (antibody based detection methods); but should correlate with detection of active infection (antigen or nucleic acid based detection methodologies). These findings will definitely assists in planning of pragmatic control strategies against CME especially in countries where its endemic scenario exists.",
