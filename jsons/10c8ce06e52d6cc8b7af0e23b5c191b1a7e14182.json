Mouse Ltk-cells do not support growth of HAV upon infection or transfection of virion RNA. However, low levels of HAV were rescued from Ltk-cells transiently transfected with its infectious cDNA. Ltk-stable transfectants that expressed HAV antigens and produced infectious HAV were selected and termed Ltk-pJH15 cells. After a few serial passages, HAV became undetectable in the Ltk-pJH15 cells. Multiple rounds of single cell cloning of HAV antigen positive Ltk-pJH15 cells resulted in the isolation of clone E8 that produced higher levels of HAV for at least 5 passages. HAV produced in E8 cells was similar to the parental virus as shown by infectivity assays. Luciferase assays using a bi-cistronic construct containing the HAV 5 noncoding region showed similar levels of HAV IRES-dependent translation in Ltk-and Ltk-pJH15 cells, which suggested that HAV IRES-dependent translation was not a limiting factor for HAV growth in these cells. The availability of the Ltk-pHJ15 cells will allow the identification of cellular factors required for HAV growth, which could lead to the development of a mouse model to study pathogenesis of HAV.",

            "text": "Hepatitis A virus (HAV), an atypical picornavirus that causes acute hepatitis in humans [16] , has a positive sense RNA genome of approximately 7,500 bases and a capsid formed by 60 copies of at least 3 viral proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3). VP4, the fourth protein found in the capsid of picornaviruses, is very small (21-23 amino acids) in HAV and has not been detected in mature virions. After binding to a cellular receptor, identified in African green monkey (AGMK) cells as havcr-1 [18] and in human cells as huhavcr-1 [9] , HAV enters the cell by an unknown mechanism. Although its replication is poorly understood, it is clear that HAV has stringent growth requirements. Cellular determinants for the efficient growth of HAV seem to be restricted to specific hosts and cell types, and HAV needs to accumulate cell-specific adapting mutations to grow in a new host. Most wildtype (wt) strains of HAV grow poorly in cell culture, however, passage of the virus in primate cell cultures results in the selection of attenuated variants that grow efficiently, produce higher viral yields, and in general do not cause cytopathic effect [4, 21] . The genomes of several cell culture-adapted strains of HAV have been sequenced and found to contain 19 to 55 mutations scattered all over the genome [3, 15, 17] . Mutations in the nonstructural P2 region of the genome are most critical for cell culture adaptation [7, 8] . Mutations in the 5'noncoding region also contribute to enhance growth in vitro [5, 7, 8] in a host cell dependent manner [5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 24] . In addition to the absolute presence or absence of cellular factors that may limit or enhance HAV replication, their relative abundance may also play a role in virus growth [14] .",

            "text": "Pathogenesis of HAV is poorly understood, and primates are the only animal model for this virus. Therefore, development of a small animal model for pathogenesis of HAV is highly desirable. Preliminary work demonstrated that HAV can grow in guinea pig, pig, and dolphin cell lines [6] and indicated that cellular factors required for HAV replication are not restricted to primates. However, HAV does not grow efficiently in murine cells upon infection or transfection with virion RNA [6 , 26] . In this paper we studied growth of HAV in mouse cells. We transfected the infectious cDNA of HAV into mouse Ltk-cells, rescued infectious virus, and showed that HAV IRES-dependent translation did not limit growth of HAV in the Ltk-cells. Therefore, it is likely that other steps of the life cycle of HAV, such as RNA replication and/or morphogenesis, are impaired in mouse Ltk-cells. Further studies of the Ltk-transfectants described in this paper could lead to the identification of cellular factors required for HAV replication in mouse cells and to the development of a murine model for HAV.",

To determine whether transfection of the infectious cDNA of HAV could bypass the block(s) to viral growth in Ltk-cells, we subcloned the fulllength cDNA of cell culture adapted HAV [2] into the eukaryotic expression vector pR/cCMV (Invitrogen, Inc.) under the control of a CMV promoter. The resulting plasmid, termed pJH15, was transfected into Ltk-cells using the cationic lipid reagent facilitator DOTAP. As a positive control, pJH15 was transfected into AGMK GL37 cells, which are susceptible cells to HAV infection. Ltk-and AGMK GL37 cells were also transfected with virion RNA using DEAE-dextran as facilitator to compare rescue of HAV from cDNA-and RNA-transfected cells. At 0 and 2 weeks postranfection, cells extracts were prepared by 3 freeze-andthaw cycles, cell debris were pelleted and discarded, and HAV was titrated on 96-well plates containing confluent monolayers of AGMK GL73 cells [25] . As expected, HAV was rescued from AGMK GL37 cells transfected with pJH15 and virion RNA but not from Ltk-cells transfected with virion RNA (Fig. 1) . Interestingly, we rescued HAV from Ltk-cells transfected with pJH15, which indicated that the cDNA transfection was able to trigger growth of HAV in these cells. Neutralization of virus produced in pJH15-transfected Ltk-cells with anti-HAV monoclonal antibodies K2-4F2 and K3-4C8 confirmed that these cells produced infectious HAV (data not shown). In addition, rescue of HAV from Ltk-cells transfected with pJH15 but not pJH16, a construct similar to pJH15 but containing an inversion of a large portion of the HAV cDNA, showed that rescue of virus form Ltk-cells depended on transfection with an infectious cDNA of HAV. It should also be pointed out that transfection of Ltk-cells with control poliovirus cDNA or RNA resulted in the rescue of poliovirus infectious particles, which indicated that neither viral cDNA transcription nor RNA stability was impared in the Ltk-cells.",

            "text": "After 3-5 passages, HAV became undetectable in the Ltk-cells transfected with pJH15, which suggested that HAV could not spread to other cells in the culture. It is also possible that the HAV-infection triggered antiviral mechanism(s) that limited the viral infection in the Ltk-cells. To further study the HAV infection in Ltkcells, we decided to establish stable Ltk-cell transfectants expressing the HAV cDNA. To do so, Ltk-cells were transfected with pJH15 and neomycin-resistant cells were selected using 800 \u00b5g/ml of the antibiotic G418 (Gibco-BRL). Sixty independent G418-resistant colonies were isolated and subjected to Southern and Northern blot analysis using 32 P-labeled HAV cDNA probes (data not shown). Five of the G418 resistant Ltk-clones, 1A2, 1C3, 1C4, 2C3, and 5C2 that contained the full-length cDNA of HAV and produced full length HAV RNA were termed Ltk-pJH15 cells. Titration of cell extracts showed that the Ltk-pJH15 cells produced approximately 2.5-3.5 log of HAV ( Fig. 2A) , which was similar to the amount of produced in the Ltk-cells transiently transfected with pJH15 ( Fig. 1 ) and significantly lower than the 7 log of HAV produced in susceptible GL37 AGMK cells. Few Ltk-pJH15 cells (less than 1%) contained HAV-specific antigens as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) analysis using human anti-HAV antibodies and FITC-labeled goat anti-human antibodies (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that the limited HAV infection of the Ltk-pJH15 cells was due to a contamination with cells of primate origin, we first infected the cells with Poliovirus for 3 days and then performed the IF analysis. Poliovirus infection did not reduce the HAV-specific IF of the Ltk-pJH15 cells, which indicated that these cells were not of primate origin (data not shown). Infection of Ltk-pJH15 with the A59 strain of Murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus that only infects murine cells, induced 100% cytopathic effect and further confirmed the murine origin of the Ltk-pJH15 cells. Interestingly, HAV titers and the number of cells expressing HAV antigens decreased upon serial passaging of the Ltk-pJH15 cells. Periodic single cell cloning of cells expressing HAV antigens was required to maintain the HAV infection in the Ltk-pJH15 cells. The instability of the HAV infection in the Ltk-pJH15 cell clones is puzzling since these cells contain the infectious cDNA of HAV and express full-length HAV RNA. Ltk-cells transfected with pJH15, which contains the infectious cDNA of HAV, were selected with the antibiotic G-418 and termed Ltk-pJH15 cells. Cell extracts of clones 1A2, 1C3, 1C4, 2C3, and 5C2 of Ltk-pJH15 cells were produced by 3 freeze-and-thaw cycles and titrated by ELISA using an endpoint dilution assay in 96well plates containing AGMK GL37 cell monolayers. Values are the log 10 of the HAV titers determined by the Reed and Muench method [22] , and the standard deviations are shown as error bars. B Selection of Ltk-pJH15 cells that produce higher levels of HAV. Clone 1C3 of Ltk-pJH15 cells was subcloned multiple times by endpoint dilution in 96-well plates. Single cell clones were analyzed by IF for the expression of HAV antigens. Single cell clones that expressed HAV antigens were grown and further subcloned. After 8 cycles of subcloning, we isolated clone E8 that produced approximately 3 log more HAV than its parental clone 1C3. Clones 1C3 and E8 were grown in 6 cm plates, cell extracts were prepared by 3 freeze-andthaw cycles, and HAV present in the extracts was titrated by ELISA using an endpoint dilution assay in 96-well plates containing AGMK GL37 cell monolayers.

Two days after transfection, cells were harvested and renilla and firefly luciferase activity were assayed using a dual-luciferase assay.

            "text": "The life cycle and pathogenesis of HAV is poorly understood, and major elements of the HAV replication strategy are still enigmatic. For instance, growth of cell culture adapted HAV requires cell-type specific mutations, and HAV adapted to grow in a primate cell system needs to be readapted before it can grow efficiently in a similar cell line. Much less is known about the growth requirements in non-primate cells [6, 10] . Adaptation of HAV to murine cell lines is highly desirable because it could help develop a mouse model to study pathogenesis of HAV to complement the currently available monkey models, which have obvious limitations. Few groups have attempted to study growth of HAV in murine cells. It has been shown that HAV does not grow in mouse Ltk-cells upon infection or transfection of virion RNA [6] , and that mouse L929 and NIH/3T3 cells are almost completely refractory to HAV infection [26] . The nature of the strong block to HAV growth in murine cells is unknown but most likely is at the cell entry and/or intracellular levels. In an attempt to define these block(s), we decided to further study replication of HAV in Ltk-cells. We found that low levels of virus could be rescued from Ltk-cells transfected with the HAV infectious cDNA but not with virion RNA. This finding was intriguing because rescue of HAV from susceptible AGMK GL37 cells is more efficient after transfection of virion RNA than transfection of HAV cDNA contained in pJH15 (J. Lu and G. Kaplan, unpublished results) . This is also the case for in vitro RNA transcripts compared to their cDNA templates [2] . It is not clear why the cDNA transfection was able to overcome the block(s) to HAV growth in Ltk-cells. It is possible that the continuous delivery of HAV RNA transcripts from the cellular nucleus to the cytoplasm was instrumental in jump-starting the HAV infection. This contrasts with the delivery of viral RNA to the cytoplasm of cells in culture after infection or transfection with RNA, which most likely occurs within a brief period not enough to trigger the HAV infection of the Ltk-cells. It should be pointed out that we could not rule out the possibility that HAV cDNA nuclear transcripts were translated via a cap-dependent mechanism and resulted in the production of infectious HAV. Consequently, the Ltk-cell transfectants that supported the efficient growth of HAV may produce higher levels of HAV transcripts and/or support higher levels of cap-dependent translation of the nuclear HAV transcripts. However, there is no current evidence to support the notion that packaging of picornaviral genomes could occur in the absence of active viral replication [20] .",

            "text": "Our study did not provide conclusive evidence on the lack of HAV receptors in Ltk-cells. Since HAV did not grow in Ltk-cells transfected with virion RNA, it is likely that the infection of Ltk-cells via a putative active cellular receptor would have encountered a similar intracellular block(s) to HAV replication. Consequently, further studies will be required to determine whether Ltk-cells code for functional HAV receptors. These intracellular block(s) to HAV replication are most likely responsible for the instability of the HAV infection in the Ltk-pJH15 cell clones. The increased and stable production of HAV in E8 cells, a subclone of the Ltk-pJH15 cells, suggested that E8 cells may lack or contain weaker intracellular block(s) to HAV replication than the parental clones. Although it is conceivable that spontaneous mutations could have adapted HAV to grow more efficiently in E8 cells, this possibility was ruled out after we found that HAV did not replicate in Ltk-cells transfected with RNA extracted from virions grown in E8 cells.",

Previous work showing that HAV translation was stimulated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate by extracts prepared from mouse liver [13] suggested that the level of HAV IRES-dependent translation in Ltk-cells could be lower than that in the Ltk-pJH15 cell clones. Our results using bi-cistronic messages coding for dual luciferases showed that HAV IRES-dependent translation was similar in the E8, 1C3, and naive Ltk-cells. Therefore, we concluded that translation of HAV is not the limiting factor restricting growth of HAV in Ltk-cells. The similar levels of HAV IRES-dependent translation in the Ltk-and Ltk-pKJH15 cells suggested that block(s) in other steps of the growth cycle of HAV, such as in RNA transcription, are limiting the HAV growth in Ltk-cells. The availability of the E8 cells, which contain the intracellular factors required for HAV growth, and the parental Ltkcells, which contain block(s) to HAV growth, represent a unique experimental system to study factors required for HAV growth using differential cloning and/or microarray technology.",

Cells were stained with human anti-HAV antibodies and FITC-labeled goat anti-human Ig antibodies.
