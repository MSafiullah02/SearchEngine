However, we propose that in areas where community transmission of new infections is kept low, elective surgeries for eye conditions that cause significant morbidity and disability, and which can be performed under local anesthesia, can be continued or resumed at lower capacity.",

Because the causative agent for COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is highly contagious with evidence of viral shedding in tears and ocular secretions of affected individuals, additional infection control measures were taken to reduce the possibility of cross infections because the Hospital Authority (administrative body of all public hospitals in Hong Kong) announced activation of emergency response level on January 25, 2020. 7 These include the following: (1) prescreening several days preoperatively (through phone) and again on the day of surgery at arrival to the Day Surgery Center; (2) the use of personal protective equipment, including compulsory universal face covering with surgical or N95 masks by staff, patients, and visitors within the hospital; and (3) rearrangement of seating (increased spacing between patients) and reducing the number of people in the waiting area (limited to 1 accompanying person per patient).",

As expected, the number of cataract operations dropped to 96 for February and 40 for March 2020 (for comparison, we performed a total of 3788 cataract operations in 2019). There were no reported cases of COVID-19 infection among our clinical staff, nor among any patients who underwent cataract surgery, during this period. Although the service was curtailed to minimize patient flow and conserve medical resources for more urgent needs, we believe it is safe, and necessary in some regions, to continue with elective cataract surgery (under local anesthesia) at lower numbers, in view of the likely prolonged period of the current COVID-19 outbreak.",
