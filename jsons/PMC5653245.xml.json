            "text": "The CXCL9 (MIG), CXCL10 (IP-10), and CXCL11 (I-TAC) chemokines, along with their cognate receptor CXCR3 participate in the development and regulation of Th1 responses. The expression of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 can be induced in virtually all cell types by a variety of stimulants including IFN-\u03b3, TLR activation and viral infection (Cameron and Kelvin, 2003, Farber, 1997, Rossi and Zlotnik, 2000). There is evidence in the literature that strongly suggests that CXCL10 is an important regulator of Th1 polarized immune responses (Krathwohl and Anderson, 2006), and that, in some instances, the CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11:CXCR3 axis can generate pathological inflammatory conditions (Liu et al., 2001, Qin et al., 1998, Ruth et al., 2001, Sorensen and Ransohoff, 1998). While several reports have identified an increased expression of CXCL9 or CXCL10 following viral infection in animal models or humans (Cameron et al., 2007a; Christen et al., 2004, Dufour et al., 2002, Liu et al., 2001, Ruth et al., 2001), the role of these chemokines and their receptor CXCR3 in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like diseases associated with pathogenic pulmonary viral infections is unknown. Support for a role of this subfamily of chemokines in SARS comes from observations by ourselves and other groups showing a correlation between increased systemic levels of CXCL10 in SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) (Cameron et al., 2007b; Cheung et al., 2005, Tang et al., 2005) and H5N1-infected individuals (Peiris et al., 2004), as well as chronically elevated levels of systemic expression of CXCL10 in patients with poor outcome post-infection (Cameron et al., 2007b, Tang et al., 2005).",

            "text": "It has been suggested that the ferret is a more appropriate animal model for SARS compared to murine and primate models (Martina et al., 2003). Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) fail to show clinical symptoms following infection with SARS CoV, despite viral replication in the species (Marshall and Enserink, 2004, Martina et al., 2003). In mice, the SARS CoV replicates well, but the value of the model as representative of the human condition has been debated due to rapid clearance of the virus and the absence of clinical symptoms (Glass et al., 2004). In contrast, SARS CoV replicates well in ferrets with infected animals demonstrating a number of clinical manifestations similar to those seen in humans, such as lethargy and elevated body temperature (Martina et al., 2003). Furthermore, SARS CoV-infected ferrets display histological evidence of pneumonitis, and a certain degree of mortality has been reported, which is also consistent with the human disease (Marshall and Enserink, 2004, Martina et al., 2003). Replication of SARS CoV occurs both in the upper and lower respiratory tract, and development of ARDS-like disease also occurs in some patients (Ng et al., 2006, Ye et al., 2007). Diarrhea has been reported in a portion of cases of human H5N1 infection, and was also noted in many infected ferrets (Sidwell and Smee, 2000, Sweet and Smith, 1980, Zitzow et al., 2002).",

In the case of CXCL10, the full-length coding region was not fully sequenced due to the lack of sequence conservation at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of the coding region. To address this issue, sequences upstream and downstream of the open reading frame were sequenced by RNA ligase mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM\u2013RACE) (data not shown).

Sequence analysis of ferret CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 genes enabled us to design primers for use in real-time PCR experiments in order to detect gene expression of these chemokines. Initially, we set out to validate the specificity of the primers and then aimed to test whether CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 transcription is induced in ferret blood cells upon LPS treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR on cDNA derived from ferret whole blood stimulated with LPS was performed and demonstrated that CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 mRNA expression was induced at various times following LPS treatment relative to unstimulated control cDNA. The peak increase for CXCL9 (3-fold above unstimulated control, P\n < 0.05) and CXCL11 (greater than 8-fold above unstimulated control, P\n < 0.01) occurred at 4 h post-stimulation, while for CXCL10 the peak increase (60-fold above unstimulated control, P\n < 0.01) occurred at 2 h following LPS treatment (Fig. 4\n).",

More recently, it has demonstrated that LCMV infection of the murine central nervous system (CNS) is associated with CXCL9 and CXCL11 up-regulation (Christensen et al., 2006). Several animal models have shown that inflammation-based pathology induced by viral infections can be reduced by either neutralization of chemokines or blockade of their receptor (Carr et al., 2003, Dawson et al., 2000, Xie et al., 2003). Treatment of spontaneously diabetic NOD mice with CXCL10 neutralizing antibodies suppressed the incidence of diabetes (Shigihara et al., 2005). In the MHV mouse model of encephalitis, neutralization of CXCL9 or CXCL10 (or in CXCL10-null mice) resulted in reduced neuropathology despite increased viral load (Dufour et al., 2002, Liu et al., 2001).",
