Cluster 2 of high importance includes the diseases HPAI, CSF, LSD, sheep and goat pox and CBPP, all of which have been well described in the past, have had epidemics and still have important outbreaks worldwide.The new swine enteric coronavirus disease, which was added on interest basis, also belongs to this cluster. The three diseases that were added to the prioritization although not present in any of the official list of notifiable diseases, Aino, Akabane and Schmallenberg, were categorized in cluster 3, even though only Schmallenberg has had outbreaks in Europe. It is therefore considered that the Simbu serogroup could be of moderate importance in (re-)emerging.From the complete list of the livestock diseases prioritized, it is important to highlight ASF. In this prioritization, ASF did not obtain the highest ranking score at 16th place and placed in the group of moderate importance of the regression tree analysis. However, ASF has become more prevalent in the Caucasus regions since its spreadfrom eastern Africa to Georgia in 2007 and the virus reached the European Union member states of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland; in 2016, Moldova; in 2017, the Czech Republic and Romania (Chenais, St\u00e5hl, Guberti, & Depner, 2018); and in 2018, the Hungary and Bulgaria. It emerged in Belgium in September of 2018 when authorities in Belgium reported that ASF had been confirmed in 2 wild boars (Linden et al., 2019). The detection of ASF in Belgium was unexpected as ASF appears to have jumped a considerable distance from previously affected countries: ~500 km from the border with the Czech Republic, 800 km from Hungary and 1,200 km from the border with Romania (Garigliany et al., 2019) and how it was introduced in the wild boar population until the writing this article is unknown (presumably related to illegal human activities) (Saegerman, Note: Highlighted numbers represent an up or down movement of more than 3 steps in the ranking.Regression tree analysis clusters group: 1 = very high importance; 2 = high importance; 3 = moderate importance; and 4 = low importance.Base model of the ranking.*Denotes more than three changes in the ranking. 2018). The ASF score (ranked 16th place and was in group of moderate importance of the regression tree analysis) may be explained that although there was an awareness of the risk of ASF spreading to EU member states, when the questionnaire was answered by the experts (year 2016) the risk that ASF would become endemic in domestic pigs in Ukraine and Belarus was considered to be moderate and the risk to further spread into unaffected areas was also considerate moderate (European Food Safety Authority, 2014; 2014). Furthermore, the score reflected the geographical position of where ASF had been reported and it was unexpected that ASF skipped neighbouring countries and directly entered Belgium(Garigliany et al., 2019).
