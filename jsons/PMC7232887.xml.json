            "text": "Coronaviruses have long been recognized as important veterinary pathogens, causing respiratory and enteric diseases in mammals as well as in birds. They are single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and subfamily Coronavirinae. About twenty-six different species have been identified (Cleri et al., 2010) and are classified into four types (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta). They are characterized by different antigenic cross-reactivity and genetic makeup (Paules et al., 2020). From the various species of coronavirus, only six have been reported to cause disease in humans. These include HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Arabi et al., 2017; Skariyachan et al., 2019). SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are beta coronaviruses, and are among the pathogens included in the World Health Organization\u2019s list of high-priority threats (Zumla et al., 2015). In late 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) initially designated as 2019-nCoV was discovered to be the cause of a large and rapidly spreading outbreak of respiratory disease, including pneumonia. According to the isolation and viral genome sequence, coronavirus was identified as a beta-coronavirus belonging to group 2B with at least 70% similarity in genetic sequence to SARS-CoV (Hui et al., 2020), and thus became the seventh discrete coronavirus species capable of causing human disease.",

            "text": "Recently, chloroquine, a medication used primarily to treat malaria, is being studied to treat coronavirus. Its putative anti-viral effects have been hypothesized to be related to the elevation of endosomal and lysosomal pH in addition to its angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibitory potentials (Vincent et al., 2005; Gay et al., 2012). Unlike viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus and herpes simplex virus, Sendai virus that can fuse the plasma membrane to successfully infect the host, enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses are endocytosed in the endosome and lysosome before fusion aiding its entry into cells (Plemper, 2011; Boopathi et al., 2020). Lysosomal lumens are the most acidic subcellular structure of the cell, pH \u223c4.5. Acidification of the lysosomal lumen activates hydrolytic enzymes which lead to the degradation of endocytic cargo (Ishida et al., 2013). However, changes in the environment of the lysosome such as a decrease in pH could elicit conformational changes of viral glycoproteins and proteolytic activation of viral glycoproteins by endosomal proteases leading to virions maturation and viral fusion with the host membranes changes (Huotari & Helenius, 2011; Richards & Jackson, 2012; Park et al., 2014). Acidification of the lysosomal lumen could enhance the cellular entry of coronavirus. Thus, intracellular extrusion of the proton through modulations of the functions of membrane proton pumps could enhance the elevation of endocytic pH and inhibit viral fusion and subsequent replication in the host.",

            "text": "Proton pumps that have been implicated in endocytic acid-base balance include vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) and Na/H exchangers (NHE). V-ATPase is a membrane-bound protein that is required to pump protons into the lysosomal lumen and maintain an acidic luminal pH. Inhibition of the host V-ATPase has been shown to result in a decrease of lysosomal acidification (Slesiona et al., 2012). Conversely, NHE modulates the luminal pH and Na+ homeostasis by transporting protons out of the lysosomal lumen in exchange for cations, hence increasing the luminal pH (Nakamura et al., 2005; Prasad & Rao, 2015). Regulation of NHE is mediated by protein kinase A through phosphorylation to sustained intracellular acidosis (Zhao et al., 1999; Haworth et al., 2003). Therefore, endocytic acidification could be dissipated through inhibition of protein kinase A.",

            "text": "Moreover, binding of the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key event in the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 (Li et al., 2003). ACE2 is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein with an N-terminal extracellular domain comprising 2 \u03b1-helical lobes, which has a catalytic site with a coordinated zinc ion between the lobes (Li et al., 2003). Increasing numbers of proteases have been demonstrated to participate in viral infection of host cells in mechanisms where they do not act as receptors. These proteases are reported to be involved not only in the adaptation of the virus to innate immune response but also in proteolytic processing of the S protein. Coronaviruses always produce two types of cysteine proteases, a chymotrypsin-like main protease and papain-like proteases (PL1pro and PL2pro) which are generally important for viral entry and replication (Elmezayen et al., 2020; Khan et al., 2020a; Muralidharan et al., 2020). The fusion of coronavirus requires proteolytic priming of its spike protein in the endosomal system. Besides, inhibition of lysosomal proteases had been hypothesised to prevent coronavirus fusion as shown in a study using mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) a safe model of coronavirus (de Haan et al., 2004; Hasan et al., 2020; Joshi et al., 2020). Various studies had been reported using computational approaches in investigating putative compounds that could be repurposed or repositioned as drugs against coronavirus (Aanouz et al., 2020; Elfiky & Azzam, 2020; Enayatkhani et al., 2020; Enmozhi et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2020; Khan et al., 2020b; Sarma et al., 2020). Several classes of compounds that had been proposed include phytochemicals and peptides (Aanouz et al., 2020; Pant et al., 2020).",

The prediction was carried out as a methodological virtual screening of the drugs. It was included as a substitute to in vivo studies which are important complements in drug discovery. The molecular properties of the drugs based on the computed partition coefficient (log P) showed that the drugs had relatively good lipophilicity as the logP values were less than 5 (Lipinski et al., 1997; Hughes et al., 2008) (Table 1). However, a negative ribavirin logP value means the ribavirinis a hydrophilic drug that could negatively impact permeability. Since high lipophilic drugs which are insoluble in aqueous layers could be poorly absorbed and hydrophilic drugs could also contribute to poor permeability, all the screened drugs except ribavirin could be maintained in the system at appropriate concentrations. Moreover, the observed lipophilicities correlated negatively with water solubility potentials of the drugs but had an association with Caco2 permeability. This corresponds to the observation of Yazdanian et al. (1998) that there was no correlation between the lipophilicity and drug permeability measured using the human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cell line assay. Caco2 permeability and intestinal absorption (HIA) indices are factors that determine the ultimate bioavailability of the drug. The drugs had relatively low Caco2 permeability potential (<8 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm/s) and could be absorbed through the human intestine (Larregieu & Benet, 2013). However, the drugs that have their subcellular localization in the lysosome are remdesivir, azithromycin, and chloroquine as predicted by ADMETSAR1 (Cheng et al., 2012). Lopinavir, remdesivir, azithromycin, and chloroquine were predicted to be substrates of P-glycoprotein, an efflux membrane transporter and a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter found primarily in epithelial cells. However, lopinavir, remdesivir, and azithromycin were also predicted as P-glycoprotein inhibitors. Thus, lopinavir, remdesivir, and azithromycin could modulate the physiological functions of P-glycoprotein in limiting the active uptake and the distribution of drugs (Srivalli & Lakshmi, 2012).",

Moreover, it was also observed that chloroquine which was recently found to be effective in the treatment of novel coronavirus infection has appreciable binding affinities for 3-Chymotrpsin- like protease and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A when compared to Oseltamivir and ribavirin. This implies that chloroquine could limit the proliferation of coronavirus by enhancing the activities of Na/H exchangers leading to elevation of pH of the lysosomal lumen, and also limiting the effect of the viral proteases. Chloroquine could be used in the treatment remedy as it could be an inhibitor of the transporter that could reverse the lysosomal pH gradient by increasing H+ influx and consequent alkalinity. Moreover, the amino acids His401, Ala348, and His378 were predicted to be the key residues for chloroquine binding to human SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein/ACE-2 complex. Analysis of the results of the autodock software revealed that chloroquine has a considerable binding affinity with coronavirus target protease.",

The deformability graphs of the complexes illustrated the degree of the capability of the respective molecule to deform shown by the peaks (Figure 6A). The empirical B-factor graphs of the complexes presented in Figure 6B were obtained from the corresponding PDB field and NMA mobility. The computed eigenvalues of the docked complexes that characterise the motion stiffness and the movement of the proteins are shown in Figure 6C with SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein/ACE-2 complex predicted to having comparatively the least required energy to deform its structure based on the lowest eigenvalue. However, the associated variance is inversely related to the eigenvalue with the individual variance indicated by red coloured bars and cumulative variance indicated by green coloured bars (Figure 6D) while the coupling between pairs of residues is illustrated by the co-variance map (Figure 6E) where red colour showed the correlated motion between a pair of residues, white colour indicated uncorrelated motion and the anti-correlated motion was indicated by blue colour. The elastic network model illustrated by the elastic map (Figure 6F) expresses the connection between the atoms with indicated by \u2018dot\u2019 and the colour gradient of the dot is directly related to their stiffness, thus, darker \u2018spot\u2019 designate stiffer springs (L\u00f3pez-Blanco et al., 2014).",

Out of the five already established antiviral drugs, lopinavir had the highest binding affinity towards SARS-CoV protease while ribavirin had the lowest binding affinity. Chloroquine recently discovered for the treatment of Coronavirus also had a considerable binding affinity to the pocket site of SARS spike glycoprotein-human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and SARS-CoV main protease. Binding of these drugs could interfere or inhibit the functions of coronavirus thereby preventing its cellular entry and proliferation. Although chloroquine could bind to the selected target proteins/enzymes, the result shows it could not be as effective as others. However, coupling it with metals could improve its binding affinity. Oseltamivir, azithromycin, and ribavirin, when compared to chloroquine, showed good drug-likeness based on the predicted pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties as revealed by low CYP inhibitory promiscuity and relatively low toxicity. However, further experimental works are recommended to validate the effectiveness of the identified therapeutic agents.",
