Earlier studies describing hMPV epidemiology and clinical characteristics have established that it is a major cause of pediatric pneumonia and bronchiolitis [2, 17, 18, 21]. Despite this significant burden, little is known about which patients are at highest risk of severe hMPV illness. Previous reports have been limited to retrospective analyses and/or have not controlled for confounding factors [22\u201324]. To our knowledge, this study is the first to prospectively evaluate host, environmental, and viral characteristics as independent risk factors for severe hMPV disease in young children, with the aim of identifying high-risk groups that would benefit most from preventive and therapeutic strategies. Young age, prematurity, female sex, household crowding, and genotype were identified as significant determinants of hMPV severity.",

However, prematurity was not a risk factor for RSV hospitalization in our model. Palivizumab prophylaxis among children with a history of prematurity may have masked some of its effect. It should also be noted that, in Quebec, children with complex medical histories (including prematurity) are referred to pediatricians for outpatient care. Consequently, the proportion of children born prematurely among our pediatric clinic patients (10.1%) was higher than that of the Quebec population (7.3%) [26]. Furthermore, despite systematic training and recruitment reminders, clinic physicians may have preferentially approached patients they considered at risk, such as those with a history of prematurity or comorbidities. This could lead to selection bias negatively affecting our ability to identify such high-risk conditions as being associated with hospitalization.",

Although experimental models have yet to address this issue, the question of a cumulative pathogenic effect in bronchiolitis has been raised, particularly for RSV-hMPV coinfections [24]. Our results do not support such a hypothesis. RSV-hMPV coinfections were not frequent enough for meaningful subgroup analyses; however, none had a severity score \u22652. Furthermore, RSV coinfections were inversely associated with hospitalization. Recently, others have also reported lower severity of RSV coinfections specifically [30] and viral coinfections overall [31]. Because detection of viral RNA/DNA may sometimes represent carryover from a previous RTI, the apparent protective effect of coinfection could be related to antiviral immune responses (eg, interferon induction) to recent infection. Interestingly, the most frequent RSV coinfecting agent in our cohort was adenovirus, a virus prone to prolonged low-level shedding [31].",

For that reason, we were not able to identify RTI unrecognized by treating physicians because of atypical manifestations. Specifically, influenza may present in young children with systemic symptoms and few or no respiratory findings; therefore, we may have underestimated its frequency. Also, we did not systematically assess the potential influence of bacterial copathogens on disease severity. Experimental animal data suggest that prior infection with hMPV predisposes to severe pneumococcal pneumonia [32]. We did not test for bacteria in our participants\u2019 nasopharyngeal secretions (indicating colonization or possible infection), and it would not have been ethical to obtain lower respiratory tract specimens from young children solely for the purpose of our study. Furthermore, although we evaluated >1000 children with RTI, our ability to assess risk factors for hMPV disease severity was limited by the incidence of hMPV-associated hospitalization (69 cases). Consequently, we were unable to assess in multivariable models the effect of specific high-risk comorbidities associated with severity in univariate analyses, such as cardiac disease or different degrees of prematurity. In addition, as discussed, a potential selection bias toward at-risk patients may have been present among pediatric clinic patients. The last 2 limitations should bias toward the null; yet, our results show significant associations between hypothesized risk factors and hMPV disease severity. Similarly to earlier evaluations of RSV [9, 28], multicenter studies will be necessary to characterize the role of specific comorbidities in hMPV illness, especially among premature infants. Finally, because very few (ie, 3) hMPV patients had a severity score of \u22652, we dichotomized our index as 0 and \u22651 to assess hMPV disease severity. This may not have allowed us to capture the risk factors associated with the most severe outcomes of hMPV RTI, such as PICU admission or death.",
