Importantly, the disease was first isolated within health care institutions, and consequently some of those who died were health care professionals such as nurses and physicians. At its peak, the SARS crisis resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) issuing a major travel advisory cautioning international visitors about visiting the city of Toronto, Canada. As Canada is a First World country priding itself upon its health care and civic infrastructure, the WHO directive was unprecedented\u2014and reasonable given the lack of understanding of how the illness was spreading and what its implications may be.",

Briefly, this method involved the use of interative analysis of a random sample representing approximately 10% of the data by 2 independent reviewers until agreement on a coding structure was achieved. Once an agreed-upon coding structure had been developed, 2 independent reviewers analyzed another sample of data representing approximately 10% of the data using the coding structure. Where disagreements in coding occurred, a third reviewer was available to adjudicate differences. On the basis of this analysis, revisions to the original coding structure were undertaken to allow for development of a final coding tree. All remaining transcripts (representing approximately 80% of the data) were subsequently read and reviewed by 2 independent investigators; where disagreements in coding occurred, a third researcher was available to adjudicate, using the agreed-upon coding structure. In this way, reliability of analysis is strengthened while minimizing the number of different reviewers required to analyze data. This method of analysis has been used to interpret data collected from a variety of different data-gathering methods, including focus groups and interviews. Data were managed and stored using the software program Knowledge Forum v3 (University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada).",

After iterative coding, categorization, analysis, and checking of data, 5 key themes emerged:1.During times of civil crisis, pharmacies become frontline health care facilitiesDuring the SARS crisis and the blackout, large institutional care centers, including large clinics and hospitals, were forced to remain closed, in an attempt to prevent the spread of the virus from institutions to the general community. As a result, during the SARS outbreak the health care system literally was suspended for many patients. Elective surgeries, new admissions, and even emergency care were redirected to other, nonaffected cities or centers where possible, or patients simply had to go without access to institutionally based physicians and nurses. During this time, study participants reported that their community pharmacies experienced a large increase in the number of patients they saw and an increase in the acuity level.\nRoger: Where else are they supposed to go, right? The hospitals in quarantine, there's no clinics open\u2026so they come to the pharmacy. It was really, really stressful\u2014people were desperate and asking all kinds of questions because they had nowhere else to turn to. We were still open, we sell (medications) so they would come and ask us everything. I know we're not allowed to diagnose, but what choice do you have when everything else is closed?\nSandy: (I've been a pharmacist for 35 years.) The SARS time was probably the most rewarding time in my career, because for once the patients actually really really needed us. Any of them who had their doctors in the hospital, well, the hospitals were all closed, so they would come to us. I really think we shone, you know pharmacy real rose to the occasion and kept the (health care) system going.\n",

But now all of sudden, they want me to diagnose things, or prescribe. It's hard to explain that I can't do that, it's against the law while I'm standing up beside all these shelves filled with drugs.\nKaren: It was really unfair to us (during SARS). Here's this rampant infectious disease and, well it's bad enough they have to close all the hospitals down and then quarantine the staff, but the pharmacies, they're all open. So of course, what happens? Everyone goes to the pharmacy because the doctor is closed. We couldn't handle all the people, all the questions, it was way out of our scope. And patients got really pissed off of course because, well they need someone, but they can't get anyone and so we're it.\n",

During the SARS outbreak, the lack of understanding of the illness itself, coupled with disorganization and lack of communication from public health officials, resulted in individuals and groups seeking out leadership and decision making at the micro or local level:\nAnne: It was just ridiculous. One day they said one thing, the next day the other. It was only when nurses started to die and there was still no \u201cofficial\u201d response that, well you take matters in your own hands, you know? You have to say, I don't know what's going on here, no one does, but I'm going to take care of myself. So I said, okay, we're going to wear gloves and masks when (we deal with our patients). I know they say that doesn't look professional, but it's safety first.\nInterviewer: Did you receive any comments about this from your customers, or (head office)?\nAnne: Nothing from the customers\u2014I mean I think they probably thought it was a good idea too, right? Head office kept sending us e-mails saying there was no need to panic, and that we shouldn't wear masks because that would like send the wrong message and it wasn't needed. But then these nurses were dying. They were dying.\nJames: Our (regional manager) didn't know what to do\u2026it's not his fault, I know. But how were we supposed to handle patients who were coughing, or who were sick. Rationally, well logically you know that not everyone who has a cold or a cough has SARS, right? But still, no one knew what was going on and no one could really tell us. So we had to make the decision ourself. We had to put the patients first, so of course we couldn't wear masks or gloves or anything while we were with them. Some of the technicians didn't like this, but, someone had to make a decision. And we used our common sense of course\u2026we would clean up and sterilize the counters every half hour or so, limit contact with patients, all that sensible stuff.\n",

I know it's not possible to develop a policy and procedure for every single situation, and, well who could have predicted that there'd be SARS and the blackout. So I guess, well, these emergency guidelines aren't really ever much good.\nCasey: It was a joke. I remember during the blackout, we were all scrambling around trying to figure what to do because we had no electricity. One of the technicians, she was looking through the policy manual we have, the one issued by (head office). She got to the section called Emergencies\u2026and in the manual, she was referred to a Web site address! Yeah, in the middle of a blackout the information we need is on a Web site.\nTim: There were no lights, no electricity\u2014even if we had an emergency plan, no one would have been able to find it because the computer wasn't working. You can't rely on guidelines or things like that when everything is falling apart\u2026you've got to rely on yourself and your common sense.\n",

All those who had received such training were unanimous in their belief that it simply did not (and likely could not) prepare them for the SARS outbreak or the blackout because these events were simply never conceived of nor discussed during training. Participants noted that the focus of their sessions tended toward bioterrorism or other similar situations, rather than the meltdown of the civilian infrastructure through an unpredictable event such as the blackout. Participants also noted that knowledge and skills gained from such training appeared to be of limited transferable utility in assisting them in coping with either crisis. Participants in this study were not asked to rate the quality of this prior training, nor to elaborate upon details.3.The role of experience and professional judgmentProfessional practice, at the best of times, is a highly context-sensitive and complex phenomenon, requiring individuals to make numerous microjudgments in a time-pressured environment. As practice has evolved, there has been increasing reliance on information and accessing information in electronic databases for decision support. During the blackout, lack of electricity meant that all electronic databases and records (including patients' profiles or drug information) were not available. Similarly, during SARS, there was virtually no information, studies, therapeutic guidelines, or other information that would assist pharmacists in making decisions.\nBill: It was supremely ironic actually. During the blackout, who do you think were the most valuable (pharmacists) I had? Not the young ones, the clinical hotshots. It was actually, the older ones, the ones who you know don't do pharmaceutical care, but actually know how to dispense, how to run a dispensary. They, well, the younger pharmacists, they didn't have a clue. They'd only ever known computerized patient records, and automatic allergy checking\u2014most of them didn't even know how to hand-write a label! What got us through these crises\u2014I know I'm not the only one who thinks this, I've talked with (other colleagues) too\u2014it was the old guys, the ones that the young hotshots are always writing off as being out of date.\nKaren: It wasn't any problem for me. When I first started working as a pharmacist, we didn't have any computers, just typewriters, so at least I knew how to produce a label, keep the dispensing record, all that stuff without computers. It was tough for everyone else, hard to get used to but in a strange way it was actually kind of fun for me.\nJames: Some of the younger pharmacists, I mean, well of course they're really bright and keen, right? But they would just get paralyzed, they just didn't know what to do. They were all ready to just close the store and say, sorry we can't help you and they expected that the customers would just understand that. Of course I had to explain, no, you can't do that. Whether there's SARS or a blackout or anything, people still need to get their drugs so we have to figure out a way to work around this problem. They just don't have the experience or the common sense sometimes.\nKelly: Some of the younger pharmacists, they were so worried about the rules and the laws. They were so paranoid, they wouldn't give another (salbutamol) inhaler to a patient, an asthma patient for years, because there were no refills! I'd say, well, the patient can't see the doctor because the office is closed, and they'd suggest the patient go to an emergency room, and well, most of them are closed too in the hospitals. And even if one was open\u2014you know how busy they'd be? Why would you send someone there, to wait for hours and to clog up the system even more, when you can just bend the rule about repeats and deal with it after in some way. No one is going to complain and you're saving everybody here.\n",

            "text": "The more recent emphasis in pharmacy education on clinical skills and problem solving has, it may be argued, come at the expense of dispensing and practice management skills. Without a strong foundation in drug distribution systems management, it was consequently more difficult for newer graduates to adapt to the crisis situation and develop creative solutions to facilitate access to medications in the circumstance.Jodi: I actually had to ask my mother\u2026she was a nurse, but used to do a lot of dispensing of medications, so she was the one that gave some ideas about how to keep records about what was dispensed or what to do when you couldn't call the doctor, right, because she's so used to that. I know she thought it was cute, but it was actually kind of annoying to me that I really didn't have a clue what to do. I was supposed to be in charge here, and I couldn't think of anything besides closing the store!\nSandy: You feel like you're in a science fiction movie. It was like only about the bare basics, that's all anyone had time for, or that's all we could do because you had no computers. You actually don't realize how helpless you become without your computer. It was different in SARS because you could, well there just wasn't information or knowledge about it. But during the blackout, you couldn't get to information you knew was right in the computer and so, you just, well, like a deer in a headlight.\n4.The importance of well-established documentation systemsA major theme for all participants related to their documentation practices during SARS and the blackout. In particular, there was recognition that these crises provoked responses by pharmacists that forced them to act in ways that may have been perilous from a medical legal perspective.\nTim: So if you've got this guy right there in front of you, and he's supposed to be getting (acetaminophen, caffeine, and codeine 30 mg) for his cancer, his pain, and he's telling you he's in pain, and he's got repeats left, but because of the blackout you can't open his file on the computer. What are you supposed to do? Tell him to come back next week when the Ohio Energy Authority restores some (power) line somewhere? You can't send him to a hospital. So you have to give him some, even though, if you're wrong, or he's lying or something that's like trafficking in narcotics, giving a drug without a prescription. So all you can do is give it to him, but write down everything you did and why and what happened.\nJerry: During SARS I called (the provincial regulatory body) for some advice about how to handle a situation. I was looking for them to say whether it was okay for me to do something or not. They just refused to say, they just kept saying use your professional judgment, but make sure you document what you did, why you did it, and what the outcome was. This was good advice I think because, really they shouldn't be making the decision for someone else.\n",

            "text": "As both the SARS crisis and the blackout continued, pharmacists noted how problematic deficiencies in documentation systems became over time:Karen: I'm glad (the pharmacy I worked in) had a pretty good system of documenting, so that pharmacists from each shift to shift had a way of communicating with each other, passing messages along. Honestly, if we didn't have that, we'd have been sunk. Our (documentation log) was the, what, thread that connected all of us, so we could tell each other what was going on during different times of the day. I used to use this kind of logbook system when I (worked in a hospital pharmacy practice). Without that kind of communication and continuity of care you'd never know what was happening from morning to evening to night.\nKelly: If there was one thing I learned, it was how important it is to have some system to communicate between pharmacists in a store, so that something that happens in the morning, well if you need to leave a message for the evening guys they know what to expect. We didn't have any kind of system like this, and if the phone wasn't working or you couldn't get a message through\u2014we had a lot of problems because of it.\nSarah: I've worked in some pharmacies where they have a really good method for pharmacists to communicate and document with each other, or with the doctors in the building. (During the blackout) the pharmacy I was working in\u2014well, they really had nothing, nothing at all. And that's when problems happen\u2014double doctoring, med errors, all sorts of things because you can't rely on your computer or your memory during something like this.\n5.The role of \u201cteamness\u201d in successful adaptationThe literature on team effectiveness has demonstrated the importance of teamwork, particularly in high-stress,22 highly ambiguous situations.23, 24 Characteristics of high-performing teams include role flexibility, fluid boundaries, sense of shared purpose, and lack of rigid hierarchy.24, 25, 26 The value of teamwork in health care has frequently been described in terms of interdisciplinary teams in specific settings, for example, psychiatry,27 geriatrics,24 surgery,28 and emergency medicine.29 Within pharmacy, there is a paucity of literature and evidence regarding the value of \u201cteams\u201d in the community pharmacy setting. Such teams will generally consist of pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, students, and a variety of clerical and support staff.\n",

We were always like that, we always worked together really well. The technicians would know exactly what to do, what they could handle, and then pass it on to the pharmacist next. When (SARS) hit, it really wasn't a big deal for us. We all, well, it was just like another new thing, you know? We were just able to roll with it because everyone pitched in, everyone knew what needed to be done.\nTim: The first thing, well, it was quite good really. One of the technicians was about 3 months pregnant for the first time, and well everyone knew her and knew they'd be trying for a couple of years and all that. So when (SARS) started, the other technicians they figured out how to let (this pregnant technician) take over all the ordering, receiving, and other jobs so she wouldn't have to come into contact with anyone. They just did it on their own, and presented (the management) with their plan and how it would work. They all knew they would need to work harder, work more even just to protect (the pregnant technician).\nSandy: It really comes down to this.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, \u201cteamness\u201d (the ability of a group to function cohesively, flexibly, and in an interdependent manner) appears to be an important predictor of successful adaptation to crises.",

Factors influencing a team's sense of cohesion are myriad, and will differ based on context and experience. Nonetheless, the ability of the team to adapt to unforeseen situations and circumstances appears to be an important determinant of how effectively each individual member of that team will function during times of crisis. Though data from this exploratory study are only preliminary, this is clearly an area for further research.",
