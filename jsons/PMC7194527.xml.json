With an exponentially increasing number of patients being diagnosed, COVID-19 heavily strains our health care system and resources.

Inpatients with suspected COVID-19 should be treated as a confirmed case for neurosurgical bedside procedures. Each patient should be placed separately in a negative-pressure isolation room.

When obtaining consent, telecommunication is strongly recommended. If the patient is to return to the designated intensive care unit or medical ward directly, extubation and postoperative recovery should be allowed in the OR to further minimize the number of staff members directly exposed to the patient's airway.

Furthermore, wearing goggles and face shield makes performing surgery under the neurosurgical microscope exceedingly difficult. Three layers of gloves diminish tactile sensation and make it less reliable during neurosurgical procedures. Wearing this extensive amount of PPE for a prolonged period during a neurosurgical operation may make the surgeon fatigued and dehydrated due to excessive sweating. Communication among the health care providers may become difficult, given the muffled voices and hearing that results from multiple layers of PPE. Additional measures, including the use of hand gestures, may be required for communication during the surgery.7 An example of health care personnel wearing proper PPE is provided in Figure 1\n.",

Upon arrival, the patient was unconscious, body temperature 38.9\u00b0C (102\u00b0F), pulse 61 bpm, respiratory rate 17 bpm, and blood pressure 179/120 mm Hg. Neurologic examination showed bilateral pupil diameter 2.5 mm, sluggish pupillary light reflex, nuchal rigidity, extremities withdrawal to pain, bilateral positive Babinski sign. Glasgow Coma Scale was 5 points, Hunt & Hess was grade 4, Modified Fisher's Scale was grade 4, and World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grading system score was grade 5. Medical history was unremarkable, with no hypertension or diabetes mellitus. There was no family history of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient had a history of traveling to Hubei province, where COVID-19 started and became the epicenter in China. The patient's family stated that the patient returned from Hubei province 12 days ago and started having a fever the day of presentation to the emergency department. Given the travel history and high body temperature, we suspected that the patient contracted the SARS-Cov-2 virus during the trip to Hubei province.",

Definitive aneurysm repair procedure was deemed necessary and urgent by the neurosurgery team; the COVID-19 emergency surgery protocol was then activated. A negative-pressure OR was requested, and the anesthesiology team was informed of the situation and the planned surgical treatment. An isolation room was reserved for the patient for immediate postoperative care. The patient was transitioned to the OR through the designated route.
