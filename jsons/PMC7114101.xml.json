SARS-CoV is a positive sense RNA virus with a genome about 30 kb and 14 potential open reading frames (ORFs) (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). SARS-CoV has four structural proteins, spike (S), membrane, nucleocapsid (N) and envelope, which are common to all members of the genus coronavirus (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). The genome contains another nine ORFs, excluding the four structural proteins and the replicase gene 1a/1b, and the length of these ORFs varies from 39 to 274 amino acids (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). These accessory proteins are specific for the SARS CoV but their functions are still not clear (see recent review by Tan et al., 2006).",

The first ORF is translated from the full-length genomic mRNA (RNA 1), while the remaining ORFs are translated from eight sgRNAs (RNA two to nine) synthesized as a nested set of 3\u2032 co-terminal RNA species in which the leader RNA sequences on the 5\u2032 end of the genome are joined to the body sequences at distinct transcription regulatory sequences containing a highly conserved consensus sequence (CS) (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003, Snijder et al., 2003, Thiel et al., 2003, Yount et al., 2003). As illustrated in Fig. 1, the full-length genomic contains nearly all the sequences found in any of the sgRNAs, hence it may be expected that siRNA targeting any of the sgRNAs will also affect the translation of the full-length genomic mRNA. Indeed, it was recently reported that major replicative inhibition effects of siRNA targeting the sgRNAs may be due to the disruption of the full-length genomic mRNA rather than viral protein knockdown (Zheng et al., 2004).",

Based on this, we designed three siRNAs to target sgRNAs 2, 3 and 7, which are required for the expression of S, 3a/3b and 7a/7b proteins, respectively. The sequence similarities between each of these siRNA and the full-length genomic RNA and sgRNAs are shown in Table 1. For example, sgRNA 2 contains all the 21 nucleotides (nt) in siRNA 2, while the full-length genomic RNA (mRNA 1) only contains 15 out of the 21 nt. These hairpin siRNAs are then expressed from the U6 promoter in a mammalian expression vector to determine if they can specifically knockdown genes encoded by targeted sgRNAs. Finally, we used these siRNAs to investigate the importance of the accessory proteins, 3a/3b and 7a/7b, for SARS-CoV replication in Vero E6 cells.",

This vector contains a GFP marker under the CMV promoter for easily tracking transfection efficiency. The inserts were chosen to match the sequences of the SARS-CoV sgRNAs 2, 3 and 7 as reported by Yount et al. (2003). For each of the siRNA inserts, the sequence corresponding to the highly conserved CS flanked by five to seven nucleotides (nt) before and 6\u201310 nt after the CS was chosen because this would give the best differentiation between the different sgRNAs and would therefore, allow specific knockdown of a specific sgRNA (see Table 1).

As shown in Table 1, the junction between the leader sequences and the body sequences that encodes for the different ORFs is the highly conserved consensus sequences (CS), which is ACGAAC for SARS-CoV.

Whereas for sgRNA 7, which is used for the expression of accessory protein, 7a and 7b (siRNA 7), a 19 nt insert was chosen because it has a GC content more suitable for RNA interference (see http://www.genscript.com for details). When comparing the sequences of siRNA 2, 3 and 7 to the full-length genomic mRNA (mRNA 1) and the eight sgRNA (mRNA 2\u20139), it is clear that there are significant differences between them. For example, the number of mismatches between siRNA 2 and the mRNA 1\u20139 (except for the targeted mRNA 2) varied from 4 to 7. Similarly, for siRNA 3, the number of mismatches (except for the targeted mRNA 3) varied from 3 to 7, and for siRNA 7, the number of mismatches (except for the targeted mRNA 7) varied from 1 to 6.

As shown in Fig. 2A, when the pXJ-CS-7a plasmid was transfected into the different stable siRNA cell lines, the expression of 7a protein was specifically knockdown in cells harboring the siRNA 7 and not in the cells harboring siRNA vector, siRNA 2 or siRNA 3.

In order to determine if there is such an effect, two cDNAs, pXJ-CS-nsp1-HA and pXJ-CS-8a-HA (see Table 2 for primer sequences), were constructed. The pXJ3\u2032HA vector allows the expressed protein to be easily detected with an anti-HA antibody (Tan et al., 2004a, Tan et al., 2004b). Note that in the case of the full length viral genomic RNA (mRNA 1), the first protein in the polyprotein pp1a, i.e nsp1, was chosen to simplify the detection. As shown in Fig. 2B, the expression of 8a-HA was significantly reduced in siRNA 7 stable cell-line when compared to the vector control cell-line or the siRNA 2 and 3 cell-lines. However, there was no significant difference for the expression of nsp1-HA for all the stable cell-lines. Hence, it may be expected that the siRNA 7 will inhibit both sgRNA 7 and sgRNA 8 but not the full length viral genomic RNA (mRNA 1) or the other sgRNAs.",

            "text": "During SARS-CoV infection, the full-length viral genomic RNA is required for the translation of the ORF 1a/1b, while the sgRNAs are used for the expression of specific viral proteins (Snijder et al., 2003, Thiel et al., 2003, Yount et al., 2003). In this study, we used the short-interfering RNA (siRNA) technology and the difference at the CS and body sequences junctions for the full-length genomic RNA and sgRNAs of SARS-CoV to design hairpin siRNAs to target specifically sgRNAs 2, 3 and 7 in order to silence the expression of the viral proteins S, 3a/3b, 7a/7b, respectively. First, we used consensus sequence(CS)-containing plasmids to mimic the full-length genomic RNA (pXJ-CS-nsp1-HA) and subgenomic RNAs 7 (pXJ-CS-7a) and 8 (pXJ-CS-8a-HA) to determine the specificity of the shRNA constructs. These plasmids contained the CS joined to the initiation codon of the first open reading frame of the full-length genomic RNA (i.e. nsp1) or subgenomic RNAs (i.e. 7a for sgRNA 7 and 8a for sgRNA 8). We found that siRNA 7 could inhibit both sgRNA 7 and 8 (Fig. 2). The siRNA 7 matches sgRNA 7 perfectly well while the mismatch between siRNA 7 and sgRNA 8 is 1 nt (Table 1). In contrast, siRNA 7 did not have an effect on the full length viral genomic RNA (mRNA 1) as the mismatch between siRNA 7 and the full length viral genomic RNA (mRNA 1) is 2 nt. The mismatch between siRNA 2 or 3 and all sgRNAs, except for sgRNA 2 and 3, respectively, is more than 3 nt and, hence, siRNA 2 or 3 are not able to inhibit any other sgRNAs. Hence, we have designed hairpin siRNAs targeting the sequence differences in the CS-body sequence junctions of sgRNA 2, sgRNA 3 or sgRNAs 7 and demonstrated that they can specifically knock down either sgRNA 2, sgRNA 3 or both sgRNAs 7 and 8, respectively, without affecting the full length viral genomic RNA (mRNA 1)or other sgRNAs.",

In addition, 3a has also been found to be expressed in SARS CoV-infected cells (Tan et al., 2004b; Yu et al., 2004, Zeng et al., 2004) and could be detected in tissues obtained from SARS-CoV infected patients (Yu et al., 2004, Law et al., 2005, Chan et al., 2005). The sgRNA 3 contains a second ORF, called 3b, which is mostly likely to be expressed via an internal ribosomal entry mechanism (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003, Snijder et al., 2003). 3b has been shown to be localized in the nucleus and to induce apoptosis when overexpressed (Yuan et al., 2005a, Yuan et al., 2005b). The 7a protein is encoded by the first ORF of sgRNA 7 (Snijder et al., 2003, Thiel et al., 2003, Yount et al., 2003) and it is expressed in SARS-CoV-infected cells (Fielding et al., 2004, Chen et al., 2005, Nelson et al., 2005). A second protein, termed 7b, may be expressed from sgRNA 7 by \u201cleaky scanning\u201d of ribosomes (Snijder et al., 2003), but to date, there is no characterization of this protein.",

IFA also showed the specific knockdown of S, 3a and 7a proteins in infected cells containing siRNA 2, 3 and 7 (based upon the GFP signal), while the expression of the N protein was not affected (Fig. 4). To our knowledge, this is the first report of inhibition of virus replication by using siRNA against the SARS-CoV accessory proteins. When compared to the inhibition by siRNA against the S protein, siRNA against 3a/3b showed comparable inhibition while siRNA against 7a/7b (and 8a/8b) was slightly more efficient. Our data showed that the siRNA 3 and 7 are able to inhibit the yield of progeny virus, and suggested that the accessory proteins, 7a/7b (and 8a/8b) and 3a/3b, could play important roles during the replication cycle of SARS-CoV.",

(Yount et al., 2005). The siRNA 7 was able to reduce the production of progeny viruses in our system, while the recombinant virus with 7a/7b deleted behaved like the wild-type virus. The difference between our data may be explained by the fact that siRNA 7 could inhibit both sgRNA 7 and 8, which are required for the expression of accessory proteins 7a, 7b, 8a and 8b. The simultaneous silencing of these four accessory proteins may also explain why we observed the highest inhibition effect with siRNA 7.",

Expression of the ORF1b gene involves ribosomal frameshifting into the \u22121 frame just upstream of the ORF1a translation termination codon. Open reading frames (ORFs) in the last 1/3 of the SARS-CoV genome are translated from eight subgenomic mRNAs (RNA 2 to RNA 9). Four of these encode the structural proteins (checked boxes), spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N). Another eight SARS-CoV-unique ORFs (grey solid boxes) encode for accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b) with no significance sequence homology to viral proteins of other coronaviruses.
