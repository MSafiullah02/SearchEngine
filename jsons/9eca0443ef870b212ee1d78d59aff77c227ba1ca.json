The cell density (A 600 nm ) in sole-sugar fermentation was determined using a Multiskan Spectrum spectrophotometer (Thermo (Figure 2b ). In contrast, the limitation of growth on glucose caused by insufficient import of the sole carbon source was partially rescued. We reasoned that the SecY (\u0394P) channel might allow glucose to diffuse through the plasma membrane due to its small V A (\u2248 0.178 m 3 /kmol) and large diffusion coefficient (D AB \u2248 1.009 \u00d7 10 -9 m 2 /s; Table 1 ; Wilke & Chang, 1955) , and we confirmed diffusion by [ 14 C]-labeled glucose transport assay ( Figure 3 ). To further enhance glucose uptake, SCVE was coexpressed in the E. coli outer membrane (Figure 2a) , which can permeabilize outer membranes of E. coli cells by forming transmembrane pores (Liao, Lescar, Tam, & Liu, 2004) . This reduced permeation barrier of the outer membrane might increase the glucose con- to fructose-1-phosphate before phosphorylation to fructose-1,6bisphosphate (Kornberg, 2001) . However, in the route established in this study, the phosphorylated fructose first appeared inside the cell as fructose-6-phosphate (Figure 1b ), which accords with use of the PtsG-F transporter (Kornberg, Lambourne, & Sproul, 2000) . The growth kinetics in Figure 4b but also caused an extensive growth delay (Ren, Chen, Zhang, Liang, & Lin, 2009) . A prolonged lag phase (\u2248 25 hr) on arabinose was also observed when we re-expressed AraFGH together with SCVE in E. coli (\u0394AraFGH, \u0394AraE; Figure 5e ), even though AraFGH is regarded as an efficient system for arabinose uptake (Luo et al., 2014) . Use of the SecY (\u0394P) channel did not seem to facilitate the initiation of the arabinose-inducible promoter P BAD (Desai & Rao, 2010 ; Figure 5f ), which controls synthesis of key enzymes (AraBAD) in the arabinose metabolism pathway in E. coli (Schleif, 2000) . Therefore, we suspect that the SecY ( (Figure 6a ). It is interesting that the SecY (\u0394P, IIIGIG)engineered E. coli (\u0394LacY) was able to grow with a rate almost similar to the wild-type after 160 hr. The possible reason is that wild-type E. coli may have other unknown systems that can transport lactose in addition to LacY, but these systems have extremely low expression levels when the wild-type E. coli grows on lactose. In this case, the engineered channel allows moderate growth of E. coli (\u0394LacY), offering a prerequisite for adaption.

T. Chen, Chiang, Wang, Lee, & Chao, 2011; Joung, Kurumbang, Sang, & Oh, 2011; Figure 2a), the cell growth defects were not observed", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "centration in the periplasm, thus increasing the glucose gradient across the SecY (\u0394P) channel, accelerating glucose diffusion into the cytoplasm (Figure 3), and increasing E. coli (\u0394PtsG) growth on glucose (Figure 2b). The glucose PTS catalyzes transport with concomitant phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. Therefore, once glucose is inside the mutant E. coli cells, phosphorylation might become the factor limiting glycolytic flux (Hern\u00e1ndez-Montalvo et al., 2003), explaining the full recovery of E. coli (\u0394PtsG) growth on glucose with overexpression of an E. coli glucokinase (Glk; Fukuda, Yamaguchi, Shimosaka, Murata, & Kimura, 1983) together with SecY (\u0394P) and SCVE (Figure 2b). We compared the Monod growth kinetic parameters of E. coli (\u0394PtsG) co-expressing SecY (\u0394P), SCVE, and Glk with those of the wild-type strain (Figure 2c). Both strains had a maximum specific growth rate (\u03bc max ) of 0.347 hr \u22121 , but the halfsaturation constant (K S ) of the mutant strain (\u2248 4.803 mM) was 0.49fold higher than that of the wild-type E. coli (\u2248 3.234 mM), indicating F I G U R E 2 Uptake of glucose via SecY (\u0394P).

Marker (lane 1), Escherichia coli (\u0394PtsG) containing pETDuet-1 and pRSFDuet-1 (lane 2), E. coli (\u0394PtsG) containing pETDuet-secY (\u0394P)-secE and pRSFDuet-secG (lane 3), the His-tagged SCVE from E. coli (\u0394PtsG) containing pETDuet-secY (\u0394P)-secE and pRSFDuet-secG-sCVE\u00b7His (lane 4).

E. coli with damaged fructose PTS (\u0394FruA;Ferenci & Kornberg, 1974) or mannose PTS (\u0394ManXYZ;Erni & Zanolari, 1985) did not grow on fructose(Figure 4a) or mannose(Figure 4c), respectively. In contrast, SecY (\u0394P) and SCVE were found to help both mutant strains, especially those on mannose, recover growth. Co-expression of an E. coli fructo(manno)kinase (Mak) that catalyzes phosphorylation of fructose or mannose in the cytoplasm(Sproul, Lambourne, Jean-Jacques, & Kornberg, 2001) allowed the FruA-lacking strain to grow on fructose at a similar rate as that of wild-type E. coli(Figure 4a). Growth of the strain without ManXYZ on mannose was even faster than that of the control(Figure 4c), suggesting that fructose or mannose imported by the SecY (\u0394P) channel satisfied demands of the cells. Here, it should be noted that fructose taken up via the fructose PTS is phosphorylated", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": ",d show that co-expression of SecY (\u0394P), SCVE, and Mak conferred almost the same \u03bc max values (0.248 hr \u22121 on fructose and 0.398 hr \u22121 on mannose) on the mutant E. coli as those of the wild-type strain. Also, as in the case of glucose, the SecY (\u0394P) channel exhibited a lower affinity for fructose (K S \u2248 1.579 mM) and mannose (K S \u2248 4.719 mM) than for the fructose PTS (K S \u2248 0.843 mM) and mannose PTS (K S \u2248 3.181 mM). 3.2 | Functional transport of the non-PTS-dependent pentoses via the SecY (\u0394P) channel Next, we tested xylose and arabinose, which are non-PTSdependent pentoses. The main transporters for xylose (XylFGH; Sumiya, Davis, Packman, McDonald, & Henderson, 1995) and arabinose (AraFGH, AraE; Schleif, 2000) in E. coli were deleted independently; thus, the obtained strains either did not grow on xylose (Figure 5a) or arabinose (Figure 5c) as the sole carbon source. As expected, co-expression of SecY (\u0394P) and SCVE fully supported the growth of mutants. The lag phases of both mutant strains were shortened when compared with wild-type E. coli, as was the case with mannose (Figure 4c). Interestingly, previous work showed that a mutant glucose facilitator protein (2-RD5)from Zymomonas mobilis in E. coli allowed rapid transport of xylose", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "\u0394P) channel transports other small nutritional molecules, allowing the cells to adapt to the growth conditions more quickly than the wild-type strain at the beginning of fermentation. The mutant strain expressing SecY (\u0394P) with SCVE showed a \u03bc max of 0.258 hr \u22121 on xylose (Figure 5b) and 0.388 hr \u22121 on arabinose (Figure 5d), which were almost identical to those of the wild-type E. coli. The K S values for the mutant strains were 3.449 and 2.066 mM on xylose Functional transport of disaccharide via the SecY (\u0394P, IIIGIG) channel Next, we investigated the transport of lactose as a model disaccharide via the SecY (\u0394P) channel. The LacY transporter (Abramson et al., 2003) was deleted from E. coli and thus the mutant strain could not grow on lactose as the sole carbon source (Figure 6a). However, the growth of E. coli (\u0394LacY) was slow after co-expression of SecY (\u0394P) and SCVE, probably because the larger molecular volume of lactose (V A \u2248 0.340 m 3 /kmol) led to a lower diffusion coefficient (D AB \u2248 0.684 \u00d7 10 \u22129 m 2 /s) than the coefficient for monosaccharides (V A \u2264 0.178 m 3 /kmol, D AB \u2265 1.009 \u00d7 10 \u22129 m 2 /s) (Table 1), resulting in reduced sugar flux through the pore ring of SecY (\u0394P). We then replaced the isoleucines (molecular weight Mr \u2248 131.18 g/mol) in the pore ring with glycines (Mr \u2248 75.07 g/mol) to enlarge the channel opening (Figure 6b). As illustrated in Figure 6c, glycine substitutions at Ile 191 and Ile 408 (SecY (\u0394P, IIIGIG)) provoked a 1.27-fold increase in permeation rate of 2-NBDG, which has almost the same V A and D AB as those of lactose (", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "). Our results show that replacing the glucose PTS with SecY (\u0394P), SCVE, and Glk enabled E. coli cells to simultaneously utilize glucose and xylose (Figure 7h) to overcome CCR. In addition, the consumption of both sugars accelerated compared with that of non-channel-engineered E. coli (\u0394PtsG), with a specific growth rate that increased from 0.174 to 0.309 hr -1 .
