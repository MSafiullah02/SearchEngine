On 7 January 2020, a novel coronavirus was identified from a throat swab sample of a patient by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and was subsequently named 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID\u201019) by the World Health Organization. As of 21 February 2020, nearly 75 114 cases of human COVID\u201019 infections have been confirmed in China, with at least 2239 reported deaths. Additional cases have spread to other countries in Asia, Europe, America, Oceania, and Africa.",

And COVID\u201019 is the seventh. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29 903 nucleotides) has shown that the COVID\u201019 is most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS\u2010like coronaviruses.1 This fact could partly explain the behavior of this novel coronavirus in human infection.",

It seems that gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea (2%\u201010.1%), and nausea and vomiting (1%\u20103.6%), are not very common at present.2, 3 However, a significant proportion of patients presented initially with those atypical gastrointestinal symptoms.",

Although more evidence is needed, Zhang et al4 from the People's Hospital of Wuhan University have reported the presence of viral nucleic acids in the fecal samples and anal swabs of patients with COVID\u201019. Therefore, there is a possibility of fecal\u2013oral transmission in COVID\u201019 infection. More attention should be paid to the hand hygiene and disinfection of patients' vomitus, feces, and other bodily fluids.",

            "text": "Previous studies have uncovered several receptors to which different coronaviruses bind, such as angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS\u2010CoV. One study showed by molecular modeling that there is a structural similarity between the receptor\u2010binding domains of SARS\u2010CoV and COVID\u201019, which means that COVID\u201019 may use ACE2 as the receptor despite the presence of amino acid mutations in the COVID\u201019 receptor\u2010binding domain.5 This finding was subsequently verified by another study which suggested that liver abnormalities might also occur in patients with COVID\u201019 because the cholangiocytes are targeted by these viruses through ACE2.6 ACE2 is known to be abundant in the epithelia of the lungs and intestine in humans, which might enhance the evidence of this possible route for COVID\u201019. Yet other authors have indicated that the expression of ACE2 is primarily located on the luminal surface of differentiated small intestinal epithelial cells, whereas lower expression has been observed in the crypt cells and the colon.7 They have also linked the amino acid transport function of ACE2 to the microbial ecology in the gastrointestinal tract in which ACE2 mutants exhibit decreased expression of antimicrobial peptides and show altered gut microbial composition. Therefore, we speculate that COVID\u201019 may, to some extent, be related to the gut microbiota.",

            "text": "However, the connection between the lung and the gastrointestinal tract is not completely understood. It is well known that the respiratory tract houses its own microbiota, but patients with respiratory infections generally have gut dysfunction or secondary gut dysfunction complications, which are related to a more severe clinical course of the disease, thus indicating gut\u2013lung crosstalk. This phenomenon can also be observed in the patients with COVID\u201019. Numerous studies have shown that modulating gut microbiota can reduce enteritis and ventilator\u2010associated pneumonia, and it can reverse certain side effects of antibiotics to avoid early influenza virus replication in lung epithelia.8 Currently, there is no direct clinical evidence that the modulation of gut microbiota plays the therapeutic role in the treatment of COVID\u201019, but we speculate that targeting gut microbiota may be a new therapeutic option or at least an adjuvant therapeutic choice. In early February, the guidance (version 5) established by the China's National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine9 recommended that in the treatment of patients with severe COVID\u201019 infection, probiotics may be used to maintain the balance of intestinal microecology and prevent secondary bacterial infection, which shows that the Chinese government and first\u2010line medical staffs accept the importance of the role of gut microbiota in COVID\u201019 infection.",

Although no specific antiviral treatment has been recommended to date, we speculate that probiotics may modulate the gut microbiota to alter the gastrointestinal symptoms favorably and may also protect the respiratory system. Further studies may focus on this point. It would be interesting to investigate whether the benefits of ACE2 on pulmonary disease may be mediated via modulation of gut and/or lung microbiota. Finally, we call upon all first\u2010line medical staffs to be cautious and pay more attention to atypical patients with an initial presentation of gastrointestinal symptoms, especially those from the epidemic area. We hope that, with the joint efforts and great support, COVID\u201019 will soon be overcome.",
