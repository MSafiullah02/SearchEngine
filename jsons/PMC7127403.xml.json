GeoSentinel sites are located on 6 continents and collect clinician-based surveillance data on travel-associated disease from more than 30 locations. TropNet Europe has 68 member sites, which contribute surveillance data for travel-associated illness in Europe. A case definition for travel-associated illness is a patient has who crossed an international border within the past 10 years and presents for a presumed travel-related illness.5 This definition encompasses a very broad set of clinical conditions, including dermatologic disease, injury, tuberculosis, and chronic diarrhea. The focus of this article is on travel-related illness that falls within the spectrum of the acute febrile syndrome.",

Most patients in this group were middle-aged men, and most people in the study group had traveled for tourism, on business, or to visit friends and relatives. These individuals (those visiting friends and relatives) constitute a high-risk group because they are much less likely than tourist travelers to receive prophylaxis, and tend to use fewer preventive measures. Consequently they are almost 9 times more likely than other groups to require inpatient treatment when they return with febrile complications of travel.9 Most individuals with fever after travel present within 1 to 3 weeks after returning home. These presentations, considered acute and subacute, are within the direct purview of the emergency medicine specialist. Among those in whom a definitive diagnosis is reached the majority have malaria, acute diarrheal disease, acute respiratory tract infections, or dengue fever (Fig. 1\n).8 More than 35% of patients presenting with a febrile syndrome after travel do not receive a definitive diagnosis, even in the hands of trained experts, which highlights the importance of a structured diagnostic approach.",

Most patients present with undifferentiated and nonlocalizing systemic febrile syndromes, so the clinical decision-making process and the diagnostic algorithm should reflect the likelihood of acquiring a specific disease based on regional morbidity, host-pathogen interaction, and the clinical assessment. Accordingly, the following 3 key areas are discussed in the next section of this review:1.Destination-specific variations in proportionate morbidity. What are the most common/likely infections that someone can bring home from a given region?2.Assessment of travel history, with emphasis on exposure, incubation period, and vaccination/chemoprophylaxis. What did the patient do/not do that might put him or her at risk for a certain infection? Does the course of illness fit with the expected incubation period for that infection?3.Clinical presentation. What patterns of the fever and other signs/symptoms point toward or rule out a diagnosis?\n",

Several diagnoses, and their empiric therapies, can be guided by an understanding of regional risk.10 GeoSentinel data, collected from 17,353 patients who traveled to 230 countries between June 1996 and August 2004, demonstrate significant regional differences in proportionate morbidity for 16 of 21 broad syndromic categories, including systemic febrile syndrome.5 In the context of systemic febrile illness, destination-specific variations in proportionate morbidity are stark (Fig. 2\n). Proportionate morbidity rates for malaria and enteric fever are regionally disparate, whereas dengue fever has a fairly broad global distribution. EuroTravelNet data from 17,228 patients show similar patterns of distribution (Fig. 3\n).11 Data from 1842 febrile returned travelers in Belgium demonstrated that 91% of all imported malaria cases were from sub-Saharan Africa, all cases of enteric fever were from Asia, and dengue was nearly evenly split between Asia and the Americas.12 Data from Australia found 6-fold higher rates of malaria in itineraries that included Africa, 13-fold increases in dengue for itineraries that included Asia, and high rates of malaria among visitors to Oceania.13, 14 Although a thorough understanding of destination-specific proportionate morbidity rates is important, other considerations must be incorporated into the assessment process. Generally speaking, geographic trends correlate with the diagnosis in roughly one-third of febrile patients returning from developing nations; the other two-thirds have undifferentiated fever and other diagnoses.",

Determination of possible infectious exposures and their associated incubation periods can be particularly helpful in ruling out causes of fever. For example, a fever that began more than 3 weeks after a traveler returned home is very unlikely to be caused by dengue, rickettsial disease, or viral hemorrhagic fever; it is much more likely to be caused by malaria (particularly the forms caused by Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium ovale) if the infection was acquired abroad. Careful attention to the exposure history, immunization status, and use of malarial chemoprophylaxis can be very helpful in establishing a diagnosis. In a series of 2071 fever episodes from 1962 patients in Europe, the majority (78%) presented within 1 month after return from travel.15 GeoSentinel data for 6957 patients presenting with fever found that after malaria, the most common specific infections causing systemic febrile illness were dengue, enteric fever, and rickettsioses, all of which have short to medium incubation periods (<21 days).8 Incubation periods for common infectious agents are presented in Table 2\n. Whereas most infections in travelers have incubation periods of less than 21 days, several can manifest more than 30 days after return (eg, malaria, tuberculosis, hepatitis, filariasis). Furthermore, patients might spend several weeks to months overseas and then present within a short time after returning home with infections that were acquired months earlier. The most common infection presenting more than 30 days after exposure is P vivax malaria (25% of patients with this infection in the United States present after 30 days).16\n",

When they are associated with a febrile syndrome, urgent treatment and diagnosis are necessary.5 The most common treatable causes are malaria and meningitis, and these must be ruled out or treated promptly in most cases. All common domestic causes of meningitis should be considered, and treatment should be initiated before confirmatory diagnosis if there is a high index of suspicion for cerebral malaria or bacterial meningitis. Patients traveling within the meningitis belt and pilgrims traveling with the Hajj to Mecca should be treated promptly for meningococcal disease, which carries a 5% to 10% case-fatality rate, even with antibiotic treatment.18 Nonbacterial encephalitis has a broad differential diagnosis, which includes common arboviral infections native to the Americas and Asia, and often requires reference laboratory analysis for confirmation. Other considerations include tuberculosis, opportunistic disease associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, leptospirosis, rabies, and alcohol withdrawal. Lastly, there have been several reports of tourists who acquired trypanosomal infections (African sleeping sickness) transmitted through bites of the tsetse fly in game parks in east and central Africa.19, 20 Central nervous system (CNS) disease is a late presentation of these infections, although fulminant cases of rapidly progressive Trypanosoma gambiense have been described.

Of these, P falciparum poses the highest risk for severe disease and complications while P vivax constitutes the bulk of chronic and recrudescent disease. Transmission occurs through the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito, with multiple species responsible for transmission. Life cycles involve both hepatic and hematologic stages; the intraerythrocytic stages account for the clinical spectrum of disease. The minimum incubation period for P falciparum is 6 days, with most clinical symptoms developing between 9 and 14 days after exposure (median 12) days.34 Incubation periods for P vivax and P ovale are significantly longer, ranging from 8 days to several months. The majority of cases of P vivax infection present within 2 months after exposure; however, cases of P vivax and P ovale have presented several years after exposure, which likely constitutes disease recrudescence.",

Thick peripheral blood films have an advantage of allowing more red blood cells to be examined per high-powered field, and therefore have increased sensitivity in comparison with thin films, which are used primarily for parasite speciation. The sensitivity of individual thick smears is variable, and depends on smear preparation and the technical experience of laboratory personnel. In recent years, malarial rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been introduced into clinical practice for antigen detection. Similar to other point-of-care tests, RDTs are fairly simple to use and numerous brands are available worldwide. In the United States, only one RDT has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, namely the BinaxNOW Malaria Test kit, which is 97% sensitive for all species of malaria and 100% sensitive for P falciparum.37 Many laboratories find this test to be superior to microscopic diagnosis, particularly when smears are performed infrequently. Other rarely used diagnostic strategies include the quantitative buffy coat technique, which allows centrifugation and separation of parasitized from unparasitized cells to facilitate parasite detection, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect parasite DNA. Regardless of the diagnostic strategy used, it is important that diagnosis should never supersede empiric treatment when severe P falciparum infection is suspected.",

As it stands, the CDC recommends parenteral quinidine for severe malaria. Quinidine remains available and effective, and should be considered first-line until parenteral artemisinin therapy is made available.41 Therapy with quinidine should be combined with doxycycline or clindamycin, and a 7-day course should be completed. For cases of uncomplicated malaria, 3 options exist in the United States. Most patients with uncomplicated disease should receive either atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone), artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem) or oral quinidine plus doxycycline. The CDC maintains a 24-hour hotline and updated online treatment guidelines, which should be referenced when treating patients with imported malaria.
