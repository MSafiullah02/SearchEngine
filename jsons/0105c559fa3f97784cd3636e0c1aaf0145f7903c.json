Smaller biopolymer chains are very rigid, so the intra-chain hydrogen bonds that involve hydroxyl groups and amino acids are less intense than the same interactions in larger chains with more conformational freedom [45] . Considering above mentioned properties, CS is widely used to design colonspecific systems. Unlike when CS is associated with GRDDSs that release the drug in gastric media, in colon-specific systems the dissolution of CS in acidic pH is overcome by association or coating with other polymers. These systems pass through the stomach quickly without significant drug release, protecting the drugs until they reach the intestine. In this organ, CS undergoes the action of enzymes from the intestinal microbiota and from its degradation can release the drug [74] .",

Due to the high conformational freedom of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the polymer chains and the close contact of the mucus, these chains diffuse through the mucosal layer, deepening and establishing more lasting interactions. Other important contribution to this stage is the suction-type effect promoted using polymers with high affinity for water that causes dehydration of the mucus, promoting the adhesion of the system; this mechanism is explained by the dehydration theory [98] .",

Although the scientific literature brings many studies on the development of gastroretentive systems exploring the high swelling capacity of CS, great care must be taken when classifying such systems as expandable. Since this mechanism acts to avoid the clearance of the pharmaceutical form through of the pylorus, a pronounced swelling is required which promotes a considerable increase in the size of the structures. This means that although many hydrophilic polymers undergo swelling when in contact with gastric fluid, it may not occur to the extent necessary to prevent its clearance from the upper GIT. In these cases, its importance is more related to the mucoadhesiveness and/or flutuation of the gel layer formed by CS swelling, as is the case with works that explore the dual mechanism of gastroretention, for example, floating and swelling [141] . The said gel layer of the swollen CS is also related to the decreased toxicity of some drugs interacting with their cationic groups by the presence of negative charges (alendronate sodium, for example). In another study, Park and Kim [144] developed glycol CS superporous hydrogels using a gas blowing method and glyoxal as the crosslinking agent. The results",

This is due to the polycatalytic CS character, which contributes to the establishment of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding with solvent and mucus. The CS DD is the main factor responsible for the cationic nature of this polymer, so that the reduction of the DD is directly associated with the increase in the positive charge's density of the chain, which contributes to the inter-and intra-chain CS repulsion. Thus, in acid media, the chains with the lowest DD will be more protonated and separated from each other, because of the electrostatic repulsion. The polymer protonation exposes groups previously inaccessible to the solvent, increasing the capacity to establish more hydrogen bonds, having an impact on PF hydration. The hydrated chains swell, increasing the adhesion area, interpenetration and interaction with mucus and water, through electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds. These interactions are the result of a pronounced increase in the conformational freedom of these hydrated chains[112,115].",

Another marked limitation is the local irritation caused in the upper portions of the GIT. Thus, treatment requires daily a strict fasting state close to the medication schedule, reducing patient compliance. In this sense, it seems evident that the development of delivery systems that manage to overcome the rapid transit time of the upper GIT by increasing its residence time at the absorption site, should contribute significantly to improving the therapeutic efficacy of alendronate.In line with this reasoning, Su and coworkers[8] developed hydrogels of CS with ring-opened polyvinyl pyrrolidone (CS/roPVP) as GRDDSs to enhance the bioavailability of alendronate for the treatment of osteoporosis. The excellent properties seen in CS, such as a high degree of swelling and mucoadhesiveness in gastric media, are decisive to delay clearance through the pyloric sphincter, as well as making the system's contact with the gastric mucosa more intimate, respectively, contributing to the enhancement of alendronate absorption. However, it is known that CS rapidly dissolves in the stomach, which would impair the prolongation of the alendronate release rates, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reason why ring-opened (ro) polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) was rationally added to the composition. In this way, gastroretentive properties were evaluated in terms of swelling ability and mucoadhesive measurements. Authors stated that tablets from CS/roPVP hydrogels showed an optimal swelling (up to 500 %) which higher axial than lateral swelling ratio, which was attributed to the application of compression force axially.Likewise, increasing proportions of CS in CS/roPVP complex were responsible for the raise of forces of mucoadhesion. It was interesting to note that in vitro release profile of the reference FOSAMAX \u00ae was 100 % in only 30 min, while the complexes promoted sustained release of alendronate. The set of acquired properties contributed to 3-fold enhancement of the oral alendronate bioavailability.",

Authors demonstrated that the production of large capsules lead to an increasing in gastric retention time (GRT). In vivo studies exhibited GRT dependent to the meal regimen. After a single meal, GRT was higher than 3 h whereas after several meals, the GRT was higher than 10 h. He et al.[160] produced bilayer floating tablet formulation (Fig. 9B) containing the combination of two distinct drugs such as metformin hydrochloride (MH) and pioglitazone hydrochloride (PG) to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This formulation comprises the incorporation of each drug into two separate layers in order to achieve sustained MH release followed by immediate PG release. The bilayer tablet was fabricated by using wet granulation method with HPMC E5 for both layers as matrix and then compressed into tablet. In vitro assays showed buoyance time up to 24 h and floating lag time of 5 min besides sustained MH release controlled by diffusion manner (for 12 h) and fast PG release. In vivo tests performed in dogs suggested good absorption of PG and the enhancement of MH bioavailability with steady plasma concentration, decreased maximum plasma concentration and reduced time of maximum concentration appears as effective and promising GRDDSs to treat T2DM.

CS-based scaffolds allow an efficient angiogenic response, favoring the oxygen supply to cells, nutrients and chemical mediators for cells proliferation and differentiation, promoting osteogenesis in vitro and in vivo. CS hydrophilicity promotes cells adhesiveness by reducing immune reactions when applicable in implants[63]. NH 2 groups available in CS interacts with erythrocytes promoting the aggregation and the formation of a physical barrier that prevents the blood loss without rejection by the organism[64]. CS with low DD and dispersed in acidified water can induce the complement pathway by recruiting more erythrocytes, promoting rapid coagulation. Additionally, the CS MW showed less impact on the coagulant effect. In this scenario, CS with MW between 10 5 and 10 6 Da displayed less coagulant capacity whereas CS with higher MW in physiological saline solution were more efficient in inducing erythrocyte aggregation. The effect of MW in CS suggests that long chains can interact with more platelets, promoting greater efficiency in hemostasis. Therefore, when DD is high the influence of MW on platelet aggregation is reduced. This effect is more pronounced by reducing DD, indicating that DD is the most important factor for platelet aggregation[54,65]. In light of this, the importance of CS to build GRDDSs orally administered is evident. However, considering the harsh barriers imposed by the gastrointestinal tract (GIT).An important aspect about the use of CS to develop drug delivery systems for GIT consists on understand CSgastrointestinal digestion process in humans. This process still lacks in-depth studies that describe it systematically. However, up to now, some studies have shown that CS cannot be digested in the upper GIT by human",

Hooda et al.[164] reported the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f preparation of MUFS based on CS and sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) via ionotropic gelation method containing Ranitidine hydrochloride (RHCl) as microspheres GRDDSs.RHCl has a narrow absorption window and is mainly absorbed in the proximal areas of GIT. Thus, conventional sustained-release dosage form reaches the colon, where it gets metabolized, resulting in low absorption and poor bioavailability (52 %). In this way, Hooda et al.[163] proposed to design microspheres GRDDs based on chitosan (CS) and sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) via ionotropic gelation containing RHCl. In vitro buoyance and mucoadhesive tests suggested that these microspheres present interesting floating (at least 12 h of buoyance) and bioadhesive properties. The above mentioned properties allowed the fabricated microspheres adhere to the gastric mucosal surface remaining prolonged period in stomach ensuring RHCl stability in gastric environment which eventually leads to better bioavailability at much lower dose. Additionally, in vitro drug release assays displayed a zero-order model suggesting that the RHCl transport across polymeric matrix occurred by a Fickian diffusion process.Talukder[165] fabricated MUFS based on crosslinking reactions among sodium alginate, calcium chloride and low methoxylated pectin (anionic polysaccharide), in aqueous solution. The alginate beads can be achieved by dropping sodium alginate solution into aqueous solution of calcium chloride to precipitate calcium alginate beads.Separation and drying processes were performed by using air convection and freezedrying. The alginate beads show porous structure that promotes buoyance for over 12 h besides increasing the residence time in gastric tract substantially (more than 5.5 h)[139,163]. Dey et al.[166] designed floating and mucoadhesive beads based on sodium alginate and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) as matrix polymers and CS as coating polymer. Sunflower oil was entrapped in this system to improve floating time.All these polymers were chosen to encapsulate amoxicillin trihydrate aiming to treat J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Helicobacter pylori infection. The floating and mucoadhesive system were prepared by ionotropic gelation method and CS used as polymer barrier promoting bioadhesion.Authors reported that these beads as interesting GRDDSs exhibiting good mucoadhesion properties, excellent efficiency of drug encapsulation increasing buoyance time and drug release for more than 24 h and 7 h, respectively[166].As multiple units floating effervescent systems, Jyang et al.[167] fabricated a blend of Eudragit L100 and Eudragit RLPO containing dipyridamole (antithrombotic agent) via solid dispersion technique and afterwards, the dispersion was incorporated into alginate beads prepared by ionotropic gelation method using CaCO 3 as gas-forming agent. Buoyance tests were performed showing that 92 % of alginate beads remained floating after 9 h suggesting that drug encapsulated can be retained in the stomach indicating specific drug delivery. In vitro release studies displayed the controlled dipyridamole release using the proposed formulation (ratio of dipyridamole:Eudragit L100:Eudragit RLPO = 1:2:3) with 70 % of release up to 9 h. In vivo results exhibited higher (about 2.52-fold) bioavailability for the FDDSs than commercial tablets corroborating this platform for stomach-specific drug delivery by the oral route.",
