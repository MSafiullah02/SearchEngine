            "text": "Coyotes (Canis latrans) are indigenous wild canids widely distributed throughout North America. They are socially monogamous, territorial [1], [2], [3], and seasonally monestrous [4], [5], [6], [7]. Both sexes are obligated to a single breeding season, extending January to March (depending on latitude), and become sexually inactive in the summer [4], [5], [6]. Spermatogenesis in coyotes begins late October or November, and mature spermatozoa may be found from December to May [4], [5], [8], [9], [10]. Meanwhile, ovaries from coyotes examined in January contain tertiary follicles, but cortices were otherwise unremarkable (without stigmata or ruptures). Ovulation is spontaneous, synchronous, and bilateral; thereafter, ovaries are dominated by corpora lutea [4], [6] and nonpregnant females enter a compulsory pseudopregnancy [11]. Coyote pups are typically born March to May, after a gestation of 60 to 63 d [4], [5], and both parents care for the young [1], [2], [5]. By July or August, ovaries are regressive but not yet fully regenerated, testes have atrophied, and epididymides are void of mature sperm [4], [5]. Accordingly, endocrine profiles supported the histologic evidence that coyote reproduction was confined to a singular seasonal event [7], [10], [11].",

Male domestic dogs are fertile year-round, and bitches are typically aseasonal, with an interestrus interval 5 to 12 mo in duration [16]. A seasonal shift in reproductive recrudescence also was reported among first generation (F1) coyote-dog hybrids. Specifically, F1 hybrid offspring became sexually active in the fall (October to December) [5], [8], [17], [18], [19], and one female bred again in May [5]. Variability in reproductive strategies of wild canids has been ascribed to changes in social or environmental conditions, particularly within genera other than Canis\n[20], [21], [22]. Thus, canid reproductive tactics appeared to be adaptive, capable of responding to alterations in selective pressures or environmental conditions.",

Seasonal changes in environmental factors act as cues allowing an animal to coordinate arrival of offspring with availability of critical resources. Photoperiod activates neuroendocrine messengers, which in turn stimulate a cascade of physiologic and behavioral events; however, receptors vary in sensitivity depending on photoperiod and sequence of exposure to hormones [23], [24], [25], [26]. In female coyotes, for example, Hodges [10] reported that in vitro cultures of pituitary cells showed a dose-dependent seasonal difference in sensitivity to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Pituitary cells collected from coyotes in winter produced significantly more luteinizing hormone than cells harvested in April to October, but only when challenged with higher doses of GnRH.",

Two short-acting agents were employed, because the sensitivity of a pure-bred coyote to treatment protocols used in domestic dogs could not be predicted. Herein we report our results and discuss how hormone manipulation might impact normal intrapair relationships, emphasizing the importance of healthy mating behavior as well as physiology for successful reproduction in wild canids.",

Elevated serum estradiol concentrations were detected approximately 9 to 12 d after treatment, followed by a rise in progesterone 18 to 26 d postimplant. This consecutive pattern of hormone synthesis (estradiol followed by progesterone) was consistent with follicular stimulation within the ovary and was reminiscent of the preovulation endocrine profile previously reported for the coyote [11]. During a normal ovarian cycle, however, progesterone remains elevated for approximately 9 wk; rising before ovulation and reaching peak concentrations 3 to 4 wk postovulation [11]. By contrast, deslorelin-induced progesterone surges appeared transient and damped, presumably because either ovulation did not occur or the corpora lutea could not be sustained.",

The subsequent expression of mating behaviors was also interesting because of the males\u2019 involvement. Affinitive behaviors (similar to courtship activity seen in winter) were first to emerge; specifically body-bumps, hip-pushes, allo-grooming, and play-solicitation. Such physical contact appears as ritualized social interactions but without obvious agonistic intent (i.e., without aggressive or passive gestures, and interactions do not end with either coyote being obviously dominant or submissive). Instead, the coyotes made contact and then separated equitably; or sometimes roles were reversed in exaggerated nonaggressive play.",

Sexual interactions require interest, participation, and cooperation of both partners; and the behaviors we witnessed were not solely female initiated. To the contrary, males appeared stimulated by and responsive to their mates, most likely abetted by incipient seasonal synthesis of testosterone.",

However, a long-term consequence was realized in the behavioral suppression observed at the beginning of the winter breeding season.

Females treated with GnRH in the fall rarely solicited their mates\u2019 attention and often rebuffed their mates\u2019 sexual overtures in the winter. Interestingly, male-initiated anogenital olfactory investigations, mate-shadowing, and precopulatory mounting attempts were also reserved.",

In these cases, the females were all na\u00efve and 2 yr old (as were their mates), and we never saw them copulate nor did any of them become pregnant. Unfortunately, the reason for reproductive failure in the younger coyotes cannot be adequately explained within the context of this study. Inexperience is a likely cause. Yet within the deslorelin cohort, there was a 3 yr old na\u00efve pair that successfully bred; and another inexperienced pair (4-yr-old female with a 2-yr-old male) in the gonadorelin group reproduced. Alternatively, it is possible that none of these females actually ovulated, although random serum samples (collected from February 11 to March 7, 2003) were within or exceeded the expected seasonal range for progesterone. Interestingly, the females were sisters, and at least two of them have successfully bred since this study (D.A. Carlson, unpublished data). We therefore speculate that decreased sensitivity to steroid hormones contributed to the inhibited sexual receptivity of the females; and without prior experience, the females may have been confused by their mates\u2019 attempts to copulate, misunderstanding them to be nonsexual agonistic gestures or play solicitations.",

If females are capable of estrus October through February and males are fertile December through May, then we speculate changes in habitat or resource availability or cross-breeding with domestic dogs could elicit a strategic shift in coyote reproduction. Monogamy and paternal care of young are important tactics in the reproductive strategy of free-roaming coyotes. Dominant adult (alpha) coyotes also are vigilant defenders of their territories, regulating access to food and potential mates. Yet the role socio-sexual behaviors play in the establishment and reinforcement of coyote pair-bonds is not fully understood. If the length of the breeding season expands from weeks into months, and the advantage of monogamy over polygamy is lost, consequent destabilization of a pack's social hierarchy could facilitate breeding among individuals previously prohibited from mating thereby affecting local population densities. Further study of coyote reproductive behavior will help biologists understand these mechanisms before alternative strategies emerge.",
