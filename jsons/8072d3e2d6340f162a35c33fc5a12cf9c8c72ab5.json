Factors under investigation include exposure to allergens, such as those of cockroaches and mice; stress; diet; lack of exercise; genetics; and exposure to indoor and outdoor pollutants [1, 2] . Another factor that is strongly related to asthma is the development of virus-induced wheezing illnesses in infancy. Recently, it has been reported that wheezing illnesses caused by human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are associated with a particularly high risk of recurrent wheezing and asthma [3, 4] , as is airway colonization in the first few months with specific bacterial pathogens (eg, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae) [5] .

In the Danish study, detection of one of these respiratory pathogens in the first 3 years of life was associated with wheezing, and the strength of this association was similar in magnitude to that observed with detection of a respiratory virus (odds ratio, 2.9 vs 2.8).

Adenoviruses most frequently cause either respiratory symptoms, gastroenteritis, or keratoconjunctivitis, and the viral diagnostic tests in our study focused on detection of B, C, and E species, which are most closely associated with respiratory illness. The severity of illness is also strain dependent; B viruses more often cause lower respiratory tract illnesses, while C viruses that were predominant in this study are more likely to cause cold symptoms. In hospital-based studies of bronchiolitis and lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children, adenoviruses caused 7%-15% of illnesses, and in 60%-80% of these illnesses adenovirus was detected with another virus [14, [16] [17] [18] . In outpatient illnesses, the contribution of adenovirus infection is more variable. Kusel and colleagues reported virology data for the first year of life in 263 children participating in a birth cohort study in Perth, Australia [19] . Adenoviruses were detected infrequently in either symptomatic infants (1.4%) or asymptomatic infants (0.4%), and these findings were similar to those from a second study of infants studied as outpatients in the United Kingdom [20] . Notably, the demographic characteristics of the Perth cohort closely resemble those of the COAST cohort, in which white race and mid-to-high socioeconomic status predominated. In contrast, one large study found higher adenovirus detection rates among young children studied as outpatients. Chonmaitree and colleagues studied 294 children aged 6 months to 3 years in Galveston, Texas, and found adenovirus by PCR in 24.1% of samples obtained during colds (including 13% of samples in which adenovirus was the only pathogen) [21] . The reason for the high rate of adenovirus infections was not stated, although it is of interest that the demographic characteristics of the study population (56% Hispanic or Latino and 31% Black) were more similar to the URECA cohort than to the COAST cohort. A number of children had adenovirus detected more than once, and sequence analysis showed that, in 81% of cases, this represented a chronic infection rather than reinfection with a different adenovirus strain [22] . Subtype B1 adenovirus strains (eg, adenovirus 14) can cause more-severe illness, including epidemics of respiratory illness in settings such as military training camps [23, 24] . Adenovirus infections are spread by aerosol droplets, and risk factors for transmission of infection among military recruits include crowded conditions and smoking [25] . In the URECA population, it is interesting that the highest rates of adenovirus infections were found in the participants from New York City, which also has the highest population density among our sites [26] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 822, "end": 826, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 827, "end": 831, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 832, "end": 836, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 837, "end": 841, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1073, "end": 1077, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1306, "end": 1310, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1836, "end": 1840, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2313, "end": 2317, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2488, "end": 2492, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2493, "end": 2496, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2663, "end": 2667, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2874, "end": 2878, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Both the URECA and COAST studies are designed to identify environmental factors, including infections with respiratory pathogens, that influence the subsequent risk for developing asthma and respiratory allergy [1, 8] . The observed differences in the etiology of respiratory illnesses could influence the patterns of acute illness and could also affect longterm outcomes. For example, wheezing illnesses in infancy are an indicator of increased asthma risk, and this risk is further modified by the type of virus causing the wheezing. Adenovirus is of particular interest relative to long-term outcomes because acute infections can lead to viral shedding for weeks or months [22] . Since both the immune system and the lungs are rapidly developing in infancy [27] , chronic infections could influence these developmental processes, leading to long-term changes in lung and/or immune function.

Strengths of the study include the prospective collection of specimens during periods of illness and health, comprehensive viral diagnostic testing, and high rates of retention. In addition, the URECA cohort focuses on urban children of low socioeconomic status who have high rates of respiratory morbidity in early life and of asthma in childhood. Comparison to the COAST cohort is facilitated by the use of similar illness ascertainment and sampling methods and by use of the same viral diagnostic system [12] . The COAST and URECA studies both enrolled children with a family history of allergies or asthma, and there could be differences between patterns of respiratory illness in these children and patterns in the general population. The demographic characteristics of the cohorts are quite different, and since there are major differences in socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and lifestyle (Table 1) , one limitation of the study is that multivariate analysis to determine which of these specific factors contribute to the different patterns of respiratory illnesses and pathogens is not possible. An additional limitation is that the samples from the 2 cohorts were collected 7 years apart. Since the samples collected in Madison yielded differences with all 4 of the urban centers and because continued monitoring in the COAST cohort has revealed persistently low rates of adenovirus isolation ( [3] and unpublished data), the temporal difference is unlikely to account for the observed differences.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 617, "end": 621, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1514, "end": 1517, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1006, "end": 1015, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In summary, we compared the viral etiology of respiratory infection and illness in urban and suburban cohorts and found significant differences in the percentage of illnesses that were attributed to viral infection, as well as the patterns of specific viruses that were detected.
