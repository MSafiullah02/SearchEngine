Despite the heterogeneity of the cases, our results indicate the significant role of viral respiratory infections in these children, in terms of clinical symptoms, lung function, antibiotic prescription, and hospital admission. We have also observed that viral isolation is more frequently associated with symptoms in cases compared with healthy controls although both groups are different in terms of age and immunity and do not allow direct comparisons. Further studies should ideally include age\u2010matched healthy controls, to better assess the impact of viral infections in children with humoral immunodeficiency. However, Peltola et al6 have reported that the duration of symptoms and of rhinovirus shedding was longer in adults with HID than in healthy children. For this reason, we expect that respiratory viruses might cause more symptoms in these patients compared with healthy children, although we have not been able to prove it.
