The largest among known RNA viruses , the genome of coronaviruses consists of a single-stranded, positivesense, 5\u2032-capped, and polyadenylated RNA of 30-32 kilobases. The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the RNA genome of coronaviruses encodes the replicase-transcriptase machinery and is expressed as two very large open reading frames (ORF), ORF1a and ORF1b. The remainder of the genome encodes the structural proteins emagluttinin-esterase protein (HE), spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), transmembrane glycoprotein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N), as well as additional, group-specifi c accessory proteins (reviewed in Masters 2006 ) . The three MHV ORFs encoding accessory proteins are interspersed within the structural genes and include ORF2a, ORF4, and ORF5a (encode ns2, ns4, and ns5a respectively) (Lai and Cavanagh 1997 ; Masters and Perlman 2013 ) (Fig. 1b ) . These general features of genomic organization are shared among all members of the Coronaviridae family; however, substantial variability exists in the number and type of ORFs expressed in the 3\u2032 region of the genome. Remarkably, there is no obvious homology between the group-specifi c proteins encoded by different coronaviruses. In fact, in the case of the SARS-CoV , several of these \"nonstructural\" proteins, including the ORF3a, 7a, 7b proteins, have turned out to be structural (Huang et al. 2006a ; Ito et al. 2005 ; Schaecher et al. 2007 ) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 193, "end": 219, "text": "Masters and Perlman 2013 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 841, "end": 855, "text": "Masters 2006 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1050, "text": "(Lai and Cavanagh 1997 ;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1077, "text": "Masters and Perlman 2013 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 1576, "end": 1597, "text": "(Huang et al. 2006a ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1598, "end": 1615, "text": "Ito et al. 2005 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1616, "end": 1639, "text": "Schaecher et al. 2007 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF136"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1078, "end": 1088, "text": "(Fig. 1b )", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Structure"}, {"text": "Several virus-encoded proteins are packaged into the virion, including the nucleocapsid (N), the spike (S) glycoprotein, the envelope (E) protein, and the transmembrane (M) glycoprotein (Fig. 1a ) . In some strains of MHV and several other group 2 coronaviruses, the envelope also contains a hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein . The S protein mediates attachment and fusion with the host cell, is the target for neutralizing antibody and often the cellular immune response, and has been shown to play a pivotal role in pathogenesis. The N protein is intimately associated with the viral RNA genome, forms the basic structure of the helical nucleocapsid, and has been shown to be involved in several aspects of genome replication (Masters 2006 ; Masters and Perlman 2013 ; Shi and Lai 2005 ) . As the most abundant of all structural proteins in the virion , the M protein is known to play a key role in assembly and particle formation through specifi c interaction with S (Godeke et al. 2000 ) , N (Hurst et al. 2005 ) , and possibly (Baudoux et al. 1998 ) E proteins . Even though it is relatively underrepresented in the mature virus particle (Yu et al. 1994 ) , the E protein is also believed to play a role in virus assembly, but is not absolutely required for this process (Kuo and Masters 2003 ) . In addition, the E protein forms pentameric bundles within lipid bi-layers that have cation-selective ion channel activity (Wilson et al. 2006 ) . While the function of the HE is not fully understood, this protein possesses esterase activity (Vlasak et al. 1988a ) , and is not required for virus replication in tissue culture cells (de Haan et al. 2002 ; Schwarz et al. 1990 ).

However, deletion of all accessory genes from MHV attenuates the virus in vitro and in vivo (de Haan et al. 2002 ) . Although deletion of individual 3\u2032 accessory proteins has little effect on virus replication in tissue culture, their conservation within the species suggests that the accessory proteins play important roles in modulating the host immune response or general host cellular processes in vivo. With regard to pathogenesis, some accessory proteins appear dispensable while others (alone or in combination) are critical for replication in the intact animal. For example, deletion of the ORF4 gene in MHV-JHM does not affect lethality (Ontiveros et al. 2003 ) , while mutation or deletion of the ORF2a gene did not affect growth in tissue culture cells but attenuated replication in mice (Schwarz et al. 1990 ; Sperry et al. 2005 ) . A recent study has shown that ORF2a has 2\u2032,5\u2032-phosphodiesterase activity which prevents the activation of cellular RNase L, thereby preventing the degradation of viral RNA (Zhao et al. 2012 ) . This antagonism of the interferon response promotes hepatitis in MHV-A59 infected mice, but does not seem to affect brain pathology (Zhao et al. 2012 ) .

MHV infection of host cells involves specifi c interaction of the S glycoprotein with a proteinaceous host cell receptor, carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM-1a ) (Williams et al. 1991 ) ; however, the pregnancy-specifi c glycoprotein ( PSG ) and other isoforms of CEACAM have also been shown to serve as a receptor for some strains of MHV. While PSG is expressed at high levels in the CNS (Chen et al. 1995 ) , only CEACAM-1a has been defi nitely proven to be the receptor used in mice ). The S protein consists of two functional domains: the S1 domain is responsible for host cell receptor binding and is prone to mutation, while the S2 domain mediates fusion with the host cell membrane and is more conserved between MHV strains. The receptor-binding domain of the MHV S protein is present within residues 1-330 of the protein (Kubo et al. 1994 ; Suzuki and Taguchi 1996 ; Taguchi et al. 1995 ) , but the precise location of the fusion domain within the S protein remains controversial. In many strains of MHV, cleavage of S into S1 and S2 domains is mediated by a furin-like enzyme and occurs during virus egress (Frana et al. 1985 ) . However, for some coronaviruses, including MHV-2 and SARS-CoV , virion S protein is not cleaved during virus egress, but is cleaved in low pH endosomes by cathepsin (Huang et al. 2006b ). The ligation of CEACAM-1a induces conformational changes between the S1 and S2 domains, which ultimately triggers fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. Virus entry can occur through one of two mechanisms. The viral envelope can fuse at neutral pH with the plasma membrane of the host cell, resulting in the uncoating and release of the viral genomic RNA into the cytoplasm. Alternatively, virus can be taken up into endocytic vesicles where S protein is cleaved, followed by fusion of the viral envelope and host vesicle membranes with subsequent release of the genomic RNA into the cytoplasm. The latter process occurs at acidic pH and is inhibited by lysosomotropic agents such as chloroquine (Kooi et al. 1991 ; Nash and Buchmeier 1997 ) .

The translation of the viral RNA genome results in the generation of Fig. 2 Overview of coronavirus replication . Upon uncoating, virus RNA is directly translated via host cell machinery into two large polyproteins , pp1a and pp1ab. Both polyproteins undergo autoproteolytic processing to generate nonstructural proteins (nsp) of the replicase gene complex (nsp1-nsp16). The replicase proteins mediate continuous or discontinuous replication of negativestrand RNA templates. Genome-length negative strands serve as template for the replication of the genomic, positive-strand RNA that is packaged into virions. Discontinuous replication results in subgenomic-length negative strands that serve as template for the nested set of subgenomic messenger RNAs (mRNA). mRNA is translated by host cell machinery into structural and accessory proteins. E, M, and S proteins assemble on intracellular membranes, along with newly synthesized full-length, positive-strand RNA that has been encapsidated by the N protein. Virus assembly occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC) , and eventual release of virus particles occurs through host cell secretory pathways two large polyproteins , pp1a (450-500 kDa) and pp1ab (750-800 kDa): the translation of the second is a result of a (\u22121) ribosomal frame shift at a pseudoknot structure during translation of ORF1a (Brierley et al. 1989 ). The polyprotein is processed into component proteins by at least two different viral proteases, a papain-like proteinase and a second proteinase with some properties similar to those of the picornavirus 3C protease (M pro ). In addition to a viral RdRp and helicase, coronaviruses encode several novel proteins including a uridylate-specifi c endoribonuclease (NendoU) , a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exoribonuclease (ExoN) , and a 2\u2032-O -ribose methyltransferase , which are likely critical for viral RNA synthesis. The 3C-and papain-like proteinases auto-process the large polyproteins either during or after translation (Ziebuhr et al. 2000 ) . Sixteen total proteins are generated from the two large polyproteins (nsp1-16), eight of which are predicted to have enzymatic activity (reviewed in Weiss and Leibowitz 2011 ) Interestingly, while many of the described functions of nsp1-16 are common to RNA viruses and are clearly important for virus replication or transcription, several others are wholly unique to coronaviruses and may play important roles in modulating cellular processes (Snijder et al. 2003 ) .

The viral RdRp initiates negative-strand synthesis via recognition of signals at the 3\u2032 end of the RNA genome. Interestingly, this process can be continuous, resulting in genomelength negative-strand molecules, or discontinuous, resulting in the generation of a nested set of subgenomic negative-strand templates (transcription, Fig. 2 ).

As described above, negative-strand synthesis can be discontinuous, resulting in subgenomic-length RNA molecules. It is generally believed that subgenomic RNA is produced during negative RNA synthesis (Sawicki et al. 2007 ). During negative-strand synthesis, elongation by viral RdRp proceeds from the 3\u2032 end of the positive-strand genome until the fi rst functional TRS sequence. At this point, via mechanisms that are unclear, the RdRp either continues to elongate (to generate genome-length negative-strand RNA) or dissociates from the positive strand, relocates to the 5\u2032 end of the positive strand, and reinitiates elongation of the nascent negative strand with subsequent incorporation of the 5\u2032 antileader sequence.

Serial passage through suckling mouse brains resulted in the selection of viruses that caused rapid and fatal encephalitis in adult mice (Weiner 1973 ; Weiner et al. 1973 ). However, this pool also contained less virulent viruses, that were isolated as described below. MHV strain A59 is a naturally occurring variant of MHV that was isolated from a mouse with severe hepatitis (Manaker et al. 1961 ). MHV-JHM and A59 are very distinct from one another in their relative infectivity, spread, cell tropism, and neurovirulence. While A59 is generally hepatotropic, intracranial, or intranasal inoculation of mice with an appropriate amount of virus can result in a persistent infection of the CNS characterized by chronic demyelination and minimal parenchymal infl ammation (Lavi et al. 1984b (Lavi et al. , 1986 . On the other hand, intracranial or intranasal inoculation of mice with the most neurovirulent strains of MHV-JHM generally results in rapid and fatal encephalitis . Attenuated variants of MHV-JHM have been selected from these initial pools by limiting dilution assays (with identifi cation by plaque size), by chemical mutagenesis, by exposure to neutralizing antibodies and by cold sensitivity. These attenuated variants are commonly used to study mechanisms of virus persistence and virus-and immune-mediated demyelination. Treatment of viral stocks with the anti-S protein neutralizing monoclonal antibody, J2.2, resulted in one of the most commonly studied attenuated variants, termed 2.2-V-1 (alternatively, rJ2.2) (Fleming et al. 1986 ). Unlike the parental strain of MHV-JHM, 2.2-V-1 preferentially infects oligodendrocytes and minimally infects neurons. Because this variant is relatively neuroattenuated, infected mice uniformly survive the acute infection but remain persistently infected. The disease course and the nature of the host immune response make infection with 2.2-V-1 particularly useful for examining the host response to persistent virus infection of the CNS, and for studying virus-induced immune-mediated pathology.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 422, "end": 443, "text": "(Bailey et al. 1949 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 444, "end": 465, "text": "Cheever et al. 1949 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 605, "end": 619, "text": "(Weiner 1973 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 620, "end": 638, "text": "Weiner et al. 1973", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}, {"start": 846, "end": 866, "text": "(Manaker et al. 1961", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 1240, "end": 1258, "text": "(Lavi et al. 1984b", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1278, "text": "(Lavi et al. , 1986", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 2001, "end": 2021, "text": "(Fleming et al. 1986", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathogenesis of MHV-Induced Disease"}, {"text": "Initial studies with MHV-JHM suggested that demyelination was largely virusmediated (Lampert et al. 1973 ; Weiner 1973 ) .

Moreover, during the course of viral infection, demyelination occurs in immunocompetent mice and in SCID or RAG \u2212/\u2212 mice reconstituted with immune cells. Thus, the host immune-effector cells that enter the CNS to protect from the acute phase of the infection can ultimately cause immunopathology during the persistent phase, leading to tissue damage and clinical evidence of demyelinating disease.

The best example of the former phenomenon is the inability of MHV to productively infect B-cells, despite very high surface expression levels of CEACAM-1a (Morales et al. 2001 ). In addition, MHV replicates efficiently in the CNS of mice despite extremely low levels of CEACAM-1a mRNA and protein expression in this tissue (Godfraind et al. 1995 (Godfraind et al. , 1997 Nakagaki et al. 2005 ) . These observations suggest that virus or host cellular factors other than CEACAM-1a also contribute to productive infection, and other data indicates that MHV can spread in CNS-derived cells independent of CEACAM-1a expression (Gallagher et al. 1992 ; Nash and Buchmeier 1996 ) . This phenomenon occurs only with highly fusogenic strains of MHV-JHM and only when the S protein is expressed on the surface of cells. It is postulated that S1 is released from the S protein when expressed on the surface, exposing the fusogenic S2 fragment. If an uninfected cell is in close proximity, virus may spread, even in the absence of specifi c receptor.

In the parenchyma, several cell types support replication of MHV, including astrocytes, macrophages, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. In contrast to intracranial inoculation, after intranasal inoculation, MHV fi rst infects and replicates in the olfactory nerve and bulb, and then spreads transneuronally to infect distal parts of the brain that are linked through neuroanatomic connections of the main olfactory bulb (MOB) (Barnett et al. 1993 ; Lavi et al. 1988 ) .

The virus replicates at high titers during the acute phase with replication peaking at approximately 5 days post-infection (p.i.). In mice that survive the acute disease, the virus cannot be recovered from mice beyond approximately 2 weeks p.i., but virus antigen and RNA can be identifi ed in the CNS out to 1 year post infection (Adami et al. 1995 ; de Aquino et al. 2014 ; Lavi et al. 1984a ; Rowe et al. 1997 ; Zhao et al. 2009 ).

First, several target cells of MHV infection in the mouse CNS (e.g., astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and neurons) do not express high levels of MHC class I or MHC class II antigen in the absence of injury (Aloisi et al. 2000 ; Fabry et al. 1994 ; Hickey 2001 ; Malone et al. 2008 ) . Thus, by virtue of the cellular tropism of the virus, persistently infected cells may not serve as targets for virus-specifi c cytotoxic CD8 T-cells (CTL) that enter the CNS. On the other hand, virus-specifi c CD8 T-cells do become activated and traffi c to the CNS of infected mice, and the ability of CTL to recognize and eliminate infected target cells is inferred from the analyses of MHV-infected, antibody-protected suckling mice (model described below) . Second, the brain is a tissue subject to minimal immune surveillance (Hickey 2001 ; Ransohoff and Engelhardt 2012 ; Ransohoff et al. 2003 ) , so virus could replicate for longer periods of time and to higher titers while remaining undetected. Third, as both macrophages and microglia can be infected by MHV, and both are critical antigen-presenting cells in the CNS, direct infection of these cells might infl uence the overall presentation of virusspecifi c antigens in the CNS. In support of this possibility, MHV infects both macrophages and dendritic cells in vitro, and infection of these cells results in diminished ability to activate virus-specifi c CD8 T-cells (Turner et al. 2004 ; Zhou et al. 2003 ) . Interestingly, CNS infection results in downregulation of CEACAM-1a receptor expression on macrophages and microglia ). CEACAM-1a downregulation was specifi cally linked to the infi ltration of CD4 T-cells. It is not known whether this phenomenon is strictly MHV-specifi c or whether this also occurs during infection of the CNS with other neurotropic viruses; however, it is postulated that this phenomenon may contribute to MHV persistence via retargeting of the virus to other cell types or by limiting T-cell activation in the CNS. Finally, prolonged infection of the CNS results in a loss of effector function by CD8 T-cells.

In contrast, much more is known about MHV-induced disease in rats . Infection generally results in fatal encephalitis in both suckling Lewis rats and suckling outbred animals; however, a percentage of rats do survive the acute disease. Infection of weanling rats results in variable disease, but infectious MHV can be recovered from all symptomatic animals. Disease in symptomatic animals is characterized by demyelination of the optic nerve, brainstem, and spinal cord, manifesting clinically as hind limb paralysis. In rats that remain asymptomatic, virus is neither recovered nor is there evidence of demyelination out to 60 days post-infection.

These systems have included the use of lethally irradiated mice and SCID or RAG1-defi cient mice . Inoculation of any of these mice with 2.2-V-1 results in acute and chronic encephalitis in the absence of demyelination of the spinal cord (Houtman and Fleming 1996a ; Wang et al. 1990 ; Wu and Perlman 1999 ) . However, reconstitution of these mice with splenocytes results in the rapid development of demyelination. Demyelination is most reproducible when cells are transferred from MHV-JHM-immune mice . Transferred hyperimmune MHV-JHM-specifi c serum is able to mediate demyelination in MHV-JHM-infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice although not as robustly as virus-specifi c T-cells. Houtman and Fleming also showed that when mice lacking CD4 or CD8 T-cells were infected, demyelination developed, showing that neither cell type is required for this process (Houtman and Fleming 1996a ) . Subsequent work showed that several components of both the innate and adaptive immune system could mediate demyelination in the brains and spinal cords of these immunodefi cient recipient mice . For example, in one study, Kim (Kim and Perlman 2005a ) used targeted recombination to generate a virus recombinant version of 2.2-V-1 that expressed the macrophage chemoattractant MCP1/CCL2. Virus-derived CCL2 , in the absence of any antiviral T-cells or antibody was suffi cient to induce demyelination in the spinal cord. While demyelination via immune-or virus-mediated destruction of oligodendrocytes is considered to be primary (not secondary to axonal damage), T-cell-mediated damage of axons has been observed concomitant with demyelination. Although not proven, this process is probably cytokine-mediated (Dandekar et al. 2001 ) . Of note, similar fi ndings are observed in the CNS of MS patients and contribute to long-term, irreversible disability (Trapp et al. 1998 ) . The cells and effector molecules that have been identifi ed as playing a critical role in virus-induced demyelination are summarized in Fig. 3 . Activated macrophages/microglia are a common feature of MHV-induced, immune-mediated demyelination as well as active lesions in patients with MS, suggesting that these cells may actually serve as the fi nal effectors of this process. Macrophages enter the CNS as infl ammatory monocytes and mature in situ. Maturation is characterized by the downregulation of Ly6C and the upregulation of CD11c, a molecule usually used to defi ne dendritic cells. In this instance, it is not clear whether CD11c expression is involved in antigen presentation or if CD11c is only a maturation marker.

Once this trigger is provided, the process of demyelination is rapidly initiated, often accompanied by worsened clinical disease. Thus, macrophages serve as the fi nal effectors of demyelination in MHV-infected mice. Demyelination occurs during the process of virus clearance, in areas devoid of virus antigen.

As described above, infection of na\u00efve mice with highly neurovirulent MHV-JHM is rapidly fatal. However, administration of antivirus antibody protects mice from MHV-JHM but virus persists (Buchmeier et al. 1984 ) . In the suckling mouse experimental system, suckling mice are infected at 10 days post-natal and are nursed by dams that were previously immunized with MHV-JHM (Perlman et al. 1987 ) . Maternal antibodies protect the mice from acute encephalitis and death; however, a variable percentage of survivors develop clinical signs of chronic disease (hind limb paralysis) by 3-8 weeks p.i. In each symptomatic mouse, virus recovered from the brain and spinal cord is mutated in the immunodominant S510 CD8 T-cell epitope (CTL escape variant virus). Thus, immune pressure exerted by a vigorous CD8 T-cell response on MHV-JHMinfected cells results in the selection of variant viruses that have undergone mutation in the immunodominant CD8 T-cell epitope (Pewe et al. 1996 ) . Generally, a single mutant is isolated from each animal, with mutation detected in position 2-7 of the CD8 T-cell epitope that abrogates either binding to the MHC class I molecule or T-cell receptor binding. The biological relevance of CTL escape in MHV-JHM was demonstrated by showing that infection with the mutant viruses resulted in increased morbidity and mortality as compared to na\u00efve mice infected with wild-type virus ). These results further underscore the notion that virus-specifi c CD8 T-cells are critical for controlling virus replication and that at least one CNSresident cell type required for virus maintenance or replication expresses MHC class I. That CTL escape variant viruses can be recovered from MHV-JHMinfected, antibody-protected mice is of particular importance, as CTL escape variants are generally only identifi ed in humans infected with HIV or HCV or nonhuman primates infected with simian immunodefi ciency virus (reviewed in Goulder and Watkins 2004 ) . Therefore, this mode of establishing a persistent MHV-JHM infection has begun to provide key insight into the virus-and host-specifi c factors that infl uence the selection of CTL escape variant viruses, including the relative contribution of antiviral antibody (Dandekar et al. 2003 ) , epitope immunodominance , and virus fi tness and T-cell functional avidity (Butler et al. 2008a , b ) . For example, the anti-MHV antibody response at the site of infection is critical for preventing the development of CTL escape variants. CTL escape is rarely detected in BALB/b mice even though epitope S510 is recognized in this mouse strain, because, unlike B6 mice, a large number of virus-specifi c antibodysecreting plasma cells are detected in the infected CNS (Dandekar et al. 2003 ) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 326, "end": 350, "text": "(Buchmeier et al. 1984 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 512, "end": 534, "text": "(Perlman et al. 1987 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1097, "end": 1116, "text": "(Pewe et al. 1996 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 2078, "end": 2104, "text": "Goulder and Watkins 2004 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2369, "end": 2392, "text": "(Dandekar et al. 2003 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2470, "end": 2496, "text": "(Butler et al. 2008a , b )", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2864, "end": 2887, "text": "(Dandekar et al. 2003 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CD8 T-Cell Responses"}, {"text": "During the persistent infection, MHV-specifi c CD8 T-cells are retained in the CNS at low levels and can be detected out to greater than 70 days p.i.

Furthermore, depletion of CD4 T-cells correlated with decreased numbers of virus-specifi c CD8 T-cells infi ltrating the brain parenchyma (Stohlman et al. 1998 ) .

A pathogenic role for CD4 T-cells during acute encephalitis was demonstrated by using targeted recombination to generate a lacking the immunodominant CD4 T-cell epitope, M133 . Infection of mice with this recombinant resulted in 100 % survival, in contrast to 100 % mortality observed when mice were infected with wild-type virus (Anghelina et al. 2006 ). Introduction of a novel CD4 T-cell epitope into the variant virus reversed the phenotype, resulting in 50 % mortality. The absence of this viral epitope had minimal effects on virulence in BALB/c mice, in which the M133 epitope is not recognized. Together, these results showed that the antivirus CD4 T-cell response and not some other factor caused more severe disease. The ratio of MHV-specifi c effector cells to T-regulatory cells may be critical for these different outcomes as transfer of Tregs decreased clinical disease and demyelination (Trandem et al. 2010 ). Interestingly, virus-specifi c Tregs exist and are even more suppressive compared to bulk Tregs, and inhibit pathogenic CD4 T-cell responses . These virus-specifi c Tregs function in both the draining lymph nodes and site of infection, the brain, to reduce the M133 -specifi c CD4 T-cell response and to a lesser extent, the total anti-MHV CD4 T-cell response. Strikingly, these cells express IFN-\u03b3 and TNF, cytokines usually associated with a pro-infl ammatory immune response.
