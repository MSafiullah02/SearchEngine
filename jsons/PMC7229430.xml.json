When applied to data, visual analytics techniques produce dashboards, among other visual analysis tools [2]. A dashboard is defined as a single-screen visual representation of data from several sources. Graphical displays and tables are used to display qualitative and quantitative indicators. The most relevant information on a dashboard has to be assimilated by managers in a single glance, with a view to improving the decision-making process [3, 4]. Over the last 10 years, dashboard technologies have been deployed widely in the field of healthcare [5]. Clinical dashboards enable easy access to several sources of data on a large number of patients, after aggregation and synthesis into concise, usable indicators. Furthermore, clinical dashboards are intended to provide clinicians with feedback on their practices and thus enable improvements in the quality of patient care [6, 7].",

Although the importance of improving intraoperative practices (such as mechanical ventilation, blood pressure control, and anesthesia depth monitoring) has been emphasized in recent years, there are still very few reports on the use of visual analytic tools that could help anesthesiologists monitor and improve their professional practice. Nelson et al. have reported on the implementation of dashboards to support clinical consistency in medications and airway management for children receiving radiation therapy [24]. Other researchers have reported the use of anesthesia dashboards to reduce discrepancies in controlled substance documentation in the operating room [25] or as an audit tool for obstetric anesthesia and pediatric anesthesia practice [26, 27].",

By developing clinical dashboards for mechanical ventilation and blood pressure control, the present research is part of Lille University Medical Center\u2019s current effort to improve intraoperative management. Specifically, in reference to current guidelines and recent literature, key indicators identified by end-users included the incidence of hypotension [40], ventilatory settings and related monitored variables (particularly driving pressure) [41], fluid administration [42] and blood transfusion [43]. Interestingly, there is significant potential for improvement in compliance with current recommendations of good practice, as they are based on relatively recent studies. Figure 2 shows that the practice of using small tidal volumes and PEEP, which is the basis of protective lung ventilation [41], has consistently increased over the past few years in our hospital. Thus, the dashboards will allow each anesthesia staff to monitor its own practice along time. Moreover, by providing data on postoperative complications, the dashboards will allow to directly assess the impact of any practice change on postoperative outcome. Finally, since the impact of practice changes likely depends on patient and/or surgical risk factors [44], our dashboards will allow for prioritization of different goals across operating rooms [for example, the primary focus will be on ventilatory endpoints in abdominal or thoracic surgery (high risk of respiratory complications), and instead on mean arterial pressure in neurosurgery (low blood pressure can promote cerebral ischemia and increase intracranial pressure)].",

            "text": "The next step of this project is to finalize the tool by addressing the problems encountered and reported by users (see Sect. 3.3). To this end, we will use a set of usability heuristics adapted to the visualization of dashboards [46] to evaluate and improve their usability. Besides, the acceptability of the dashboard by clinicians and units\u2019 heads will be assessed through a questionnaire inspired by the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology [47]. In subsequent work, we intend to assess the dashboards\u2019 medium-term acceptability with anesthetists and other healthcare professionals. After a few months of use, a further round of development might be useful for adapting the existing dashboards and generating new ones that address novel themes and issues and are applicable to other medical specialties. The integration of new data sources could also be considered. On the clinical front, we will have to evaluate the impact of dashboards on activity, practices and endpoints, such as patient outcomes [48]. In this sense, a dashboard could be considered to be an audit tool [49]; it will also be important to establish how dashboards might (i) help clinicians to become more aware of their practice and habits, (ii) change the clinicians\u2019 representations of their activities, and (iii) assist with the decision-making process. For example, the discovery and appropriation of indicators by clinicians will help them to define targets, according to the context of their service and the recommendations of learned societies.",
