For the purpose of this chapter, the Chinese hamster will be referred to as Cricetulus griseus the classification used by most authors. The Chinese hamster, also known as the striped-back hamster (Figure 35.1\n), is indigenous to Northern Asia, with a range extending from southern Siberia, Mongolia, and northeastern China, to the northern regions of North Korea. The Chinese hamster has had an important and much storied role in biomedical research. However in recent years, this hamster\u2019s contributions as a laboratory animal have been largely overshadowed by the focus on its cell lines and the role they play in scientific research and biotechnology.",

In female\u2013female encounters, marking frequency correlates with behavioral dominance. In female\u2013male interactions, the male marks more frequently although the females are usually dominant in fights or chases. In typical female\u2013female and male\u2013male encounters, marking behavior follows rather than precedes engagement in fighting behavior. The lack of warning behaviors and the high level of food caching behavior observed in the Chinese hamster are suggestive that in their natural habitat this species lives a relatively solitary existence with infrequent encounters with conspecifics (Skirrow and Rysan, 1976).",

However, a reversed illumination schedule has been used to successfully establish a production colony for research purposes (Yerganian, 1958). Subsequently, several other schemes have been utilized to manage Chinese hamster breeding colonies due to the aggressiveness of the animals, particularly the females. Consequently, females with non-aggressive behavior (Calland, 1986) or sexually aggressive males (Moore, 1965) are selected as breeders. Modified test mating and monogamous mating schemes are used to breed the Chinese hamster (Camden et al., 1968, 1969). In one approach, a female is placed with a male for 7 days or longer, but the female is removed prior to delivery of the litter. In a second scheme, the male and female are left together during the entire reproductive life of the pair. Hand-mating and artificial insemination have been used with moderate success (Avery, 1968). A more practical and efficient approach to produce Chinese hamsters on a commercial scale has been reported (Cisar et al., 1972). In this system, three males are placed in a breeding cage with three to five female littermates at weaning; the authors reported a 3.5% loss of males per month.",

Progesterone blood levels peak on day 19 with a dramatic drop immediately prior to parturition (Sato et al., 1984). Breeding is confirmed by the presence of a vaginal plug. Pregnancy is indicated by a closed vagina, with dry, pale, and scaly perineal tissue at 4 days post-mating.

Grossly, the two conditions appear similar with multiple nodules ranging in size from less than 1 mm to greater than 1 cm in diameter, and lighter in color than the surrounding tissue. Histologically, these are nodular hyperplastic lesions ranging from small nodules with normal sinusoid and central vein structure to coalescing masses with disrupted tissue architecture. Parenchymal cells are often enlarged with increased eosinophilic and sometimes vacuolated cytoplasm. Cell nuclei are enlarged but otherwise had a benign appearance. Nodular hyperplasia was distinguished from hepatocellular adenoma by the appearance of abundant hyperchromatic nuclei containing multiple nucleoli. Ward and Moore (1969) also distinguished between nodular hyperplasia and hepatic adenomas. In their investigation they found a much higher incidence of hepatic adenomas.

Several genetic and environmental factors have been demonstrated to play a role in this metabolic disturbance in the hamster and influence the extent of beta cell death. These factors include the amount of food consumed, dietary composition, and uterine environment of the dam (Dulin and Gerritsen, 1967, 1972; Gerritsen and Dulin, 1967, Gerritsen and Dulin, 1972, Gerritsen et al., 1970, Gerritsen et al., 1974, Gerritsen et al., 1976, Gerritsen et al., 1981). Plasma insulin and glucagon levels have been shown to be altered in chronically diabetic animals. In general, diabetic Chinese hamsters exhibit low, non-fasting plasma insulin levels (Gerritsen and Dulin, 1967, Gerritsen and Blanks, 1974, Gerritsen, 1982). Plasma insulin levels of newly diagnosed diabetic Chinese hamsters are usually within normal limits or slightly elevated (Gerritsen and Blanks, 1974, Gerritsen, 1982). Plasma glucagon levels are usually elevated with chronic disease (Chang et al., 1977a). The chronic absolute deficiency of plasma insulin and the high plasma glucagon levels in the diabetic Chinese hamster are similar to endocrinologic changes observed for human type I diabetes. Pancreatic hormone levels are markedly altered in the chronic diabetic state. Pancreatic insulin levels are decreased, whereas pancreatic glucagon levels are generally elevated, particularly with chronic disease. Pancreatic somatostatin concentrations are significantly decreased in diabetic Chinese hamsters (Petersson et al., 1977).",

            "text": "A number of studies using the Chinese hamster have focused on structural changes in the islets of Langerhans. Primary morphological alterations are observed in the \u03b2 cells, which degranulate as the disease progresses (Boquist, 1969, Like et al., 1974a, Like et al., 1974b, Malaisse et al., 1967). The defective \u03b2 cells in the Chinese hamster are characterized by proliferation of rough endoplasmic reticulum, expansion of the Golgi apparatus, and glycogen deposition (Boquist, 1969, Luse et al., 1967, Soret et al., 1974). The islets are reduced in size due to \u03b2-cell death (Carpenter et al., 1967, Carpenter et al., 1970). Some peripheral tissues and organs have been studied by light and/or electron microscopy, to better characterize the diabetic Chinese hamster. Glycogen deposition in the renal tubules is the most consistent change in the kidney (Soret et al., 1973, Soret et al., 1974). Examination of the eyes of diabetic Chinese hamsters documents the presence of retinal lesions. The most consistent finding involves glycogen deposition within M\u00fcller cells of the outer nuclear layer (Soret et al., 1973, Soret et al., 1974). Structural changes have been identified in the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems of diabetic Chinese hamsters. Alterations of the hypothalamic\u2013hypophyseal axis may provide the basis for the development of diabetic syndrome in this animal model (Bestetti and Rossi, 1982, Deslex and Rossi, 1976, Luse et al., 1970). Extensive studies of the autonomic nervous system, including both qualitative and morphometric, have been conducted in the diabetic Chinese hamster. Aberrant myelination and axonal degeneration of pelvic viscera may contribute to urinary bladder distension in the diabetic Chinese hamster (Dail et al., 1977). Reduction of myelinated and unmyelinated fiber size in the abdominal sympathetic trunk and ventral abdominal vagus nerve might be a causative factor underlying gastrointestinal malfunction in the diabetic Chinese hamster (Diani et al., 1981, Diani et al., 1984).",

However, based upon epidemiologic examination of diabetic animals from other colonies, a polygenic hypothesis has been proposed for the disease. This hypothesis states that the Chinese hamster possesses a minimum of four recessive diabetogenic genes. In the homozygous state, any two of the genes produce a glycosuric hamster. Extensive genetic studies involving backcrosses have now shown that certain sublines of hamsters possess a single recessive gene for diabetes, whereas other sublines possess two recessive genes (Gerritsen et al., 1984). The onset of glycouria in the diabetic hamsters is regulated by a multi-gene system. Inbred non-diabetic Chinese hamsters appear to lack any recessive genes for diabetes.",

In another study, dietary restriction was shown to delay the development of glycosuria and hyperglycemia. Hyperinsulinemia is typically not observed in non-hyperphagic prediabetic animals (Gerritsen et al., 1981). Metabolic complications associated with diabetes are reduced or prevented by changes in dietary composition. A reduction in dietary fat and replacement of animal fat with vegetable fat in the diet ameliorates or prevents ketonuria (Gerritsen et al., 1981, Grodsky et al., 1974).",

There is no observed concurrent degranulation and degeneration of islet \u03b2 cells (Losert et al., 1971; Richter et al., 1971). A transient glycosuria is produced with low-dose streptozotocin (25 mg/kg) administered in concert with NPH insulin therapy (Berman et al., 1973). In several studies, streptozotocin was administered to adult animals as a single dose (175 or 200 mg/kg). Changes indicative of diabetogenesis included hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and pancreatic islet changes affecting both \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells. Further, pancreatic insulin and glucagon levels were significantly reduced (Dulin and Soret, 1977). Others have shown that, following treatment with streptozotocin, the \u03b2 cells undergo severe degeneration characterized by cytoplasmic vacuolization, nuclear pyknosis, and cell necrosis (Wilander and Boquist, 1972).",

In addition, mutants defective in transcription, translation, and amino acid/polyamine biosynthesis have been isolated. The isolation of cells deficient in DHFR enzyme has led to an effective means for selection of stable clones and amplification of genes (Puck, 1985). DHFR is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of folic acid to tetrahydrofolate (THF). THF is a carrier for one-carbon molecules required in the biosynthesis of glycine, purine, and thymidine. In the early 1980s, Chasin et al. isolated two DHFR-deficient mutants (DXB11 and DG44), that are common parent cell lines used today (Graf and Chasin, 1982, Urlaub and Chasin, 1980, Urlaub et al., 1983). Both DHFR-deficient mutants are derivatives of a proline-requiring auxotroph established by Kao and Puck (1968).",

            "text": "The Chinese hamster has played an invaluable role in biomedical research from rigorous in vivo scientific investigations of its unique biological features to cell-culture-based experimentation. With the advent of cell culture techniques developed within the past 50 years, Chinese hamster-derived cells have played a major role in cytogenetic toxicity assays and the production of glycosylated therapeutic proteins. Numerous recombinant cell lines have been produced using Chinese hamster cells transfected with genes derived from human or other mammalian cells. Advances in cell culture techniques have obviated the need for performing many in vivo studies, and Chinese hamster cell culture research has led to the prolific production of recombinant proteins through bioengineering. During the past 20 years, CHO cells have been utilized to produce numerous recombinant therapeutic proteins to treat a wide array of human diseases. A list is provided in Table 35.10\nof some select therapeutic proteins derived from Chinese hamster cell cultures. Currently, greater than 50% of all recombinant therapeutic proteins are derived from cells of Chinese hamster origin, with annual world-wide revenues exceeding 30 billion dollars (Jayapal et al., 2007). The current focus on the use of Chinese hamster cells in cell culture research exemplifies animal welfare initiatives to refine, reduce, and replace the use of animals in research. The history of the Chinese hamster as a laboratory animal is replete with studies clearly demonstrating its value as a unique animal model in biomedical research.",
