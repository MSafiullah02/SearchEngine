KD is the leading cause of acquired heart disease of children in the United States. This illness, fi rst recognized to be a new entity by Tomasaku Kawasaki in Japan in 1967 (1, 2) , was termed for mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (MCLNS) until KD became the accepted designation for this disorder (3) . Although the disorder was named after Kawasaki, at least one previous case exists in the medical literature (4) . This case, recounted in detail below, is classic in its clinical features of KD.",

Oropharyngeal lesions included an aphthous stomatitis, erythematous lesions of the hard palate, and prominent lingual papillae. On the fi fth hospital day the hectic fevers ceased, but low-grade fevers and tachycardia to 140 beats per minute persisted. The skin of her fi ngers desquamated, but over the ensuing weeks she improved steadily. One month after admission, however, she developed acute chest pain, shortness of breath, and expired. A postmortem examination revealed blood and clots in the pericardial space, and several large aneurysms along the epicardial vessels. One aneurysm, the size of a large ripe cherry in the left coronary artery, was the site of hemorrhage into the pericardium. Although the microscopic appearance of the disease was typical of periarteritis nodosa (i.e., PAN; see Chapter 21B), no hepatic or renal infarctions were present. Indeed, among the internal organs the heart alone was involved. The child's death was attributed to an atypical case of \"infantile periarteritis nodosa,\" now recognized as KD.",

In all 50 of the patients described initially by Kawasaki, the symptoms resolved without sequelae within 1 month. In subsequent years, however, mortality from cardiac complications (usually coronary artery thrombosis) was reported (5, 6) . Cardiac complications of KD result from a severe panvasculitis, leading to narrowing of the coronary lumina by the migration of myointimal cells from the media through the fragmented internal elastic lamina. Although catastrophic heart complications occur in only a small minority of patients (<5%), the preponderance of patients with KD appear to have at least some cardiac involvement. Heart lesions may include myocarditis, pericarditis, aneurysmal dilatation and thrombosis of the coronary arteries ( Figure 21F -2), and myocardial infarction. The tropism of the vascular infl ammation for coronary arteries and its unusual propensity to cause aneurysm formation remain unexplained.",

Support exists for a superantigen-mediated process both from clinical studies (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) and from a murine model for coronary arteritis stimulated by Lactobacillus casei cell wall extracts (23) . This hypothesis proposes that the etiologic agents-which may differ across geographic sites throughout the world-are capable of evoking immunologic responses via T-cell receptor V beta restriction. An oligoclonal response is supported by the discovery of IgA-secreting plasma cells within gia and arthritis, aseptic meningitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, pericardial effusion, obstructive jaundice, and hydrops of the gallbladder. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), a critical medication in the treatment of KD, is a limited resource in many parts of the world because of its expense. The American Heart Association (AHA), concerned about both the potential for overuse of IVIG as well as the failure to employ this medication in a timely manner in appropriate patients, issued guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of KD (Tables 21F-2 through 21F-4) (12, 13) . In these guidelines, the epidemiologic case defi nition of KD included fever of at least 4 days and four or more principal criteria (Table  21F -1) without other explanation; or fever and less than four principal criteria if coronary artery abnormalities are detected by echocardiogram or coronary angiography.",

Because of the potential for impedance of aspirin absorption caused by vasculitic involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, however, the use of aspirin must be monitored carefully in this setting. If aspirin doses are too high (e.g., 100-150 mg/kg/day), improvement of intestinal absorption with therapy may lead to symptoms of toxicity. In Japan, doses of 30 to 50 mg/kg/day have been employed because of the high incidence of the slowacetylator gene in the Japanese population. A combined US and Japanese multicenter study demonstrated that 30 to 50 mg/kg of aspirin plus IVIG (see below) was effective at preventing aneurysm formation in most cases (29) . Current AHA guidelines, however, endorse aspirin doses of 80 to 100 mg/kg/day, in four divided doses (Table 21F-4) .",

Several years later, a follow-up trial compared a single dose of IVIG (2 g/kg) to the traditional 0.4 mg/kg/day \u00d7 4 schedule, confi rming the superiority (a further lowering of the coronary aneurysm rate) of the single-dose regimen (32) .

Although aspirin alone reduced the aneurysm rate from 20% to 11% compared with the no-treatment group, treatment with prednisolone was associated with an increase in the percentages of patients who developed aneurysm to 67% (34) . Of note, the seven patients treated with aspirin plus prednisolone-none of whom developed aneurysm-were not emphasized in the discussion.

Of greatest alarm was the fi nding of such abnormalities in areas of the vasculature previously documented as normal by echocardiogram and even coronary angiography. Electron microscopy studies of endomyocardial biopsies up to 23 years after the KD episode showed ongoing microaneurysms and small vessel coagulopathy. In a small number of young adults who have experienced myocardial infarctions in the absence of known cardiac risk factors, angiograms have revealed giant coronary artery aneurysms compatible with old KD.
