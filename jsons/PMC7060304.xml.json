The animals received conventional mechanical ventilation (Servo-i ventilator, Solna, Sweden) under volume-controlled mode (respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute; inspiration-to-expiration time ratio 1:2 and PEEP 5 cmH2O; fraction of inspiration O2 (FiO2) and tidal volume (VT) 0.4 and 6 ml/kg, respectively).

In addition, arterial blood samples were collected from a PiCCO catheter. A continuous infusion of a 5 ml/(kg h) balanced electrolyte solution was administered during the experiment, and MAP was maintained above 60 mmHg with rapid infusions of 0.9% saline solution at up to 20 ml/kg, if required.",

The increased mPaw lead to more lung tissue hyperinflated, and the EIT-CoV decrease, which revealed redistribution toward non-dependent regions.

EIT has been used in PEEP titration and tidal volume setting by comparison with various conventional methods, such as CT [28], single-photon-emission computed tomography [29], positron emission tomography [30], and pneumotachography [31]. Previous studies have already shown that EIT was able to monitor ventilation distribution during HFOV in preterm infants and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [22, 32]. The optimal settings based on oxygenation were comparable to EIT-CoV and EIT-regional ventilation distribution. It was also observed that overdistended regions were large at the mPaw selected with oxygenation method in several pigs. PF ratio is an invasive method with a certain time delay in response to pressure changes. Although the average values between EIT-derived measures were not very different, individual differences could be large (up to 6 cmH2O, Figs. 2 and 3). Hence, mPaw titration with EIT-based indices improved regional ventilation distribution while titration aiming oxygenation was not always the case. Besides, it is worth to note that EIT is currently the only bedside non-invasive tool to assess overdistension. Further investigation should be conducted in future clinical studies.",
