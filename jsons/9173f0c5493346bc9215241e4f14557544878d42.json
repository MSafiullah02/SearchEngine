Cesium hydroxide, a strong base, is quite corrosive, and can attack glass. Clinicians and responders will need to be aware of the spectrum of risk posed by chemicals used in SRDs and other devices (1) .",

RDDs, also known as \"dirty bombs,\" are simply conventional explosives attached to radioactive materials (1, 5, 6) . Common radioactive materials, such as 137 Cs, are potential sources for dirty bombs. Once detonated, the RDD can contaminate a large area, but because the material is widely dispersed, the level of contamination at any specific location would likely be small. People close to the site of the explosion, however, might suffer physical, potentially lethal injuries from the blast as well as greater radiation doses. For most victims, aside from blast injuries, external contamination with radiologic particles would be the primary problem. Health care providers responding to the victims should consider all exposed victims externally contaminated and at risk for skin injury from beta particles, described later in this chapter. In addition, all victims would require assessment for potential internal contamination through inhalation or absorption through wounds (5) .",

Aside from physical blast injuries, most people exposed would receive less than 100 mrem (millirem) of radiation exposure, which would provide a chronic disease risk of about 1/20,000, equivalent to smoking 100 cigarettes. Those few in the highest exposed group who received 5,000 mrem would suffer chronic risks equivalent to a long-term smoker's risk of cancer. Health care providers treating exposed patients could reduce the exposure levels by removing clothing and washing residual contamination off the skin. Of course, terrorists would probably not announce that the bomb they detonated contained radioactive material. Until authorities detected the radioactive source, other than the immediate blast effects, the radiological injuries could be covert and delayed, determined only when patients developing symptoms arrived at physician offices and emergency rooms after an incubation period.",

Exposure to such unshielded material for an hour at a distance of 1 m would provide enough radiation exposure to cause death without medical care.

Alpha particles, containing two protons and two neutrons, contain a large amount of energy but cannot penetrate very far. While alpha particles can travel 2-3 cm in air, they can penetrate only microns into tissue. Clothing and even the outer, dead layers of skin will block alpha particles and prevent them from causing any injury to live tissue. Therefore, external contamination by alpha particles is not hazardous. On the other hand, alpha particles emitted from sources that have entered the body through ingestion, inhalation or wounds can cause significant damage to adjacent live tissue. Alpha particles are therefore a significant internal hazard (1, 7) . Radioisotopes with atomic numbers of 82 and higher, such as uranium or plutonium, are the major sources of alpha particles (4). Beta particles are high-energy electrons. Compared to alpha particles, beta particles are less massive, can travel farther, up to 1 m in air, and penetrate deeper, up to a centimeter into exposed skin. A light material, such as aluminum or thick plastic, can block penetration. Clothing, including hospital protective clothing, will only partially block beta particle penetration. Depending on the radioactive isotope source, beta particles can have varying degrees of energy, measured in mega electron volts (MeV). Beta particles containing low levels of energy, 0.1 MeV, will penetrate 0.15 cm into tissue, whereas those with 5 MeV can penetrate 5 cm into live tissue. Beta particles left on the skin can cause severe burns to the skin and to the anterior compartment of the eye. Like alpha particles, beta particles are a significant internal hazard (1, 4, 7) .",

The resulting clinical picture reflects damage to these cellular elements, and includes hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, cerebrovascular and cutaneous component syndromes. Each syndrome consists of four phases, prodromal, latent, manifest illness, and recovery or death. The time course and severity of the syndromes reflect the degree and rate of exposure (2). Table 4 .1 illustrates the first three phases, including onset time, associated signs and symptoms, affected organ systems and prognosis (7) . Depending on the absorbed dose, patients will progress through the four phases at different rates, following a predictable clinical course. The prodromal phase usually begins within 48 h, but can occur as late as 6 days following exposure. Clinicians can estimate the dose a patient may have absorbed based on symptoms, system onset and laboratory studies. The presence and onset time of nausea and vomiting and the results of serial CBCs can help clinicians determine the severity of exposure. For example, significant lymphocytopenia developing in the first 6-48 h is a reliable indication that a patient will require prolonged, intense observation and treatment (5). During the relatively brief latent phase, prodromal symptoms improve, and patients may appear recovered. Although patients may be asymptomatic, rapidly proliferating hematopoietic and gastrointestinal cells continue to die during the latent phase. The duration of the latent phase varies, depending on the radiation dose absorbed, the presence of any coexisting illness or injury and other patient characteristics (4) . The manifest illness phase, characterized by moderate to severe immunosuppression, soon follows, with symptoms lasting up to weeks, depending on the absorbed dose. Clinical manifestations depend on several factors, including the organ system most involved (hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, vascular, neurological and cutaneous), the absorbed dose, and any associated coexisting illnesses or injuries (4).",

Ulceration may also be visible (5, 8) . Epidermal and sometimes, dermal loss characterizes the cutaneous injury from radiation exposure. Although the skin injury may cover a small area, the damage may extend deeply into soft tissue, affecting muscle and bone. Patients may develop significant local edema with the potential for a compartment syndrome (2) .",

In addition, any radioactive material that concentrates in the maternal tissues adjacent to the uterus, such as the bladder, can cause fetal exposure. Internal exposures to substances tending to concentrate in specific organs, such as iodine-131 and iodine-123 in the thyroid, iron-59 in the liver, gallium-67 in the spleen and strontium-90 and yttrium-90 in the bones, can cause exposure to their corresponding fetal organs.",

            "text": "After estimating fetal exposure, clinicians should consider the potential health effects on the fetus. Potential fetal health effects other than cancer are a function of gestational age and radiation dose (13) . The information in Table 4 .4 can help physicians advise their pregnant patients, but the table does not provide definitive recommendations. However, clinicians should consider these basic principles in providing advice to pregnant women exposed to radiation: -The main health concern for significant exposures greater than 0.1 Gy early in the pregnancy (before 2 weeks of gestation) is death of the embryo. If the embryo survives the exposure, noncancer health consequences are unlikely, no matter how high the exposure dose. The reason for this is that the few cells contained in the embryo are progenitors for many other cells. Damage to one cell in the embryo will generally cause the death of the embryo. Surviving embryos successfully implanting in the uterus are unlikely to exhibit congenital abnormalities (13) . -Throughout gestation, radiation-induced noncancer health effects are undetectable for fetal doses below 0.05 Gy. Available research suggests that doses below 0.05 Gy represent no risk at any stage of development. However, research on rodents suggests that doses in the 0.05-0.10 Gy range may present a small risk of malformations or central nervous system abnormalities at some stages of gestation. Nevertheless, when providing advice regarding prenatal exposure, clinicians can consider 0.10-0.20 Gy as a practical threshold for congenital effects in the human embryo or fetus (13). -Between 8 and 15 weeks of gestation, radiation can impair brain development, with atomic bomb survivor data revealing an average IQ loss of 25-31 points per Gy above 0.10 Gy. The risk for severe mental retardation increases by 40% per Gy at doses above 0.10 Gy (13). -Between approximately 16 weeks gestation and birth, radiation-induced noncancer health effects are unlikely for fetal exposures below 0.50 Gy. Although some researchers believe that doses above 0.10 Gy between 16 and 25 weeks of gestation present a small risk for impaired brain function, most researchers believe that following 16 weeks gestation, 0.50-0.70 Gy doses represent the threshold for congenital effects (13) . Both the gray (Gy) and the rad are units of absorbed dose and reflect the amount of energy deposited into a mass of tissue (1 Gy = 100 rads). In this document, the absorbed dose is that dose received by the entire fetus (whole-body fetal dose). The referenced absorbed dose levels in this document are assumed to be from beta, gamma, or X-radiation. Neutron or proton radiation produces many of the health effects described herein at lower absorbed dose levels c A fetal dose of 1 Gy (100 rads) will likely kill 50% of the embryos. The dose necessary to kill 100% of human embryos or fetuses before 18 weeks' gestation is about 5 Gy (500 rads) d For adults, the LD50/60 (the dose necessary to kill 50% of the exposed population in 60 days) is about 3-5 Gy (300-500 rads) and the LD100 (the dose necessary to kill 100% of the exposed population) is around 10 Gy (1,000 rads) -Although the central nervous system is less sensitive to radiation between 16 and 25 weeks gestation, higher doses at this stage can cause similar central nervous system impairment as do lower doses between 8 and 15 weeks. At doses above 0.70 Gy, the average IQ loss is about 13-21 points per Gy. In addition, above 0.70 Gy, the risk for severe mental retardation is about 9% per Gy (13). -At 16-25 weeks, the fetal thyroid is active and susceptible to damage from radioactive iodine exposure. Maternal exposures will concentrate in the fetal thyroid at this stage of development (13) . -At 26 weeks and beyond, the fetus is less sensitive to noncancer effects from radiation exposure. However, large doses, above 1 Gy increase the risk for miscarriage, fetal death and neonatal death (13) . -In sufficient dosage, ionizing radiation can impair development occurring at the time of exposure. Data for pregnant atomic bomb survivors demonstrate permanent physical growth retardation at increasing exposures, especially above 1 Gy, and especially if the exposure occurs in the first trimester. The survivor data suggest a 3-4% reduction of height at age 18 for exposures greater than 1 Gy (13). Table 4 .5 describes the risk for childhood cancer from prenatal exposure and the lifetime cancer risk for exposure at age 10. Researchers do not know whether the carcinogenic effects of a given radiological exposure vary with gestation. The current wisdom is that carcinogenic effects are constant throughout pregnancy. However, available animal data suggest that exposure during the early stages of pregnancy, during blastogenesis and organogenesis, is less likely carcinogenic. The same data suggest that late in gestation, fetuses are strongly sensitive to carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation (13) . Also unknown is the lifetime cancer risk following prenatal exposure to radiation. When advising pregnant women exposed to radiation, clinicians should consider that available data suggest that lifetime cancer risk from prenatal exposure is similar to, or slightly higher than, the cancer risk secondary to childhood exposure (Table 4 .5).",

Patients admitted with airways or endotracheal tubes are more likely to have internal contamination (9) . Treatment of ingestion exposures with aluminum hydroxide or magnesium carbonate antacids can prevent or at least minimize internal contamination by reducing gastrointestinal absorption. Following ingestion of strontium isotopes, patients should receive aluminum-containing antacids. Gastric lavage administered within 1-2 h after ingestion can also help reduce internal contamination. Patients suffering from large ingestion doses should receive cathartics, including enemas, to decrease gastrointestinal transit time (5) . For patients with significant inhalation exposures to insoluble radionuclides, pulmonary lavage may be considered but is seldom indicated (5). The lifetime cancer risks from prenatal radiation exposure are not yet known. The lifetime risk estimates given are for Japanese males exposed at age 10 years from models published by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic males exposed at age 10 years from models published by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation d Lifetime cancer mortality is roughly one-third of lifetime cancer incidence Although potassium iodide does not protect the thyroid from external radiation, patients suffering from internal radioiodine contamination should receive potassium iodide to prevent or reduce thyroid uptake. To be effective, patients must receive the potassium iodide within a few hours after exposure (5, 11) . Compared to adults, children are more susceptible to the effects of radioiodine. Consequently, the Federal Drug Administration (15) and World Health Organization recommendations for administration of potassium iodide differ for children and adults. Table 4 .6 contains the FDA recommendations for potassium iodide administration.",

On the other hand, exposed neonates, infants and children should receive potassium iodide to avoid thyroid exposures as low as 10 mGy. Exposed pregnant women should receive potassium iodide to protect themselves as well as their fetus. Administration of potassium iodide to lactating women can reduce the level of radioiodine in milk, but their breast-feeding infants should still receive potassium iodide (15) . Potential potassium iodide side effects include rashes, allergic reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms, and patients with underlying thyroid disease can develop iodine-induced thyroid dysfunction (5) . Because the protective effect of potassium iodide lasts for only 24 h, patients with continued exposure through ingestion or inhalation should continue to receive daily doses until the significant exposure has ceased. Physicians should avoid repeat potassium iodide dosing in infants to reduce the risk of hypothyroidism during the critical stage of brain development. Likewise, physicians should avoid repeat dosing in pregnant and lactating women if possible. If repeat dosing is necessary, the neonate will require T4 and TSH monitoring with administration of thyroid hormone if hypothyroidism develops (15) . The FDA has approved the oral administration of Prussian Blue (ferric hexacyanoferrate) to treat internal contamination with cesium and thallium (16) . Prussian Blue works by increasing fecal excretion of these elements. Patients require treatment only if the exposure dose of 137 Cs exceeds the annual limit (200 uCi from inhalation or 100 uCi from ingestion) (5) . Clinicians should consult with a health physicist to determine whether exposure has exceeded the annual limit. Treatment for exposures between one and ten times the annual limit is controversial. However, exposures exceeding ten times the limit usually indicate the need for treatment. Once treatment has reduced the level of internal contamination below the annual limit, Prussian Blue treatment can stop. However, the clinician can use his or her discretion to discontinue treatment if residual levels remain above the annual limit after prolonged treatment (5).",

Filgrastim and sargramostim have hastened neutrophil recovery 3-6 days in patients following Consensus guidance for treatment is based on threshold whole-body or significant partial-body exposure does. Events due to a detonation of a RDD resulting in \u2264100 casualties and those due to detonation of an improvised nuclear device resulting in >100 casualties have been considered. These guidelines are intended to supplement (and not substitute for) clinical findings based on examination of the patient. NA = not applicable; SCT = stern-cell transplantation b Prophylactic antibiotics include a fluoroquinolone, acyclovir (if patient is seropositive for herpes simplex virus or has a medical history of this virus), and fluconazole when absolute neutrophil count is < 0.500 \u00d7 10 9 cells L \u22121 c Consider initiating therapy at lower exposure dose in nonadolescent children and elderly persons. Initiate treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor in victims who develop an absolute neutrophil count < 0.500 \u00d7 10 9 cells L \u22121 and are not already receiving colony stimulating factor d Absolute neutrophil count < 0.500 \u00d7 10 9 cells L \u22121 . Antibiotic therapy should be continued until neutrophil recovery has occurred. Follow Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines (17) for febrile neutropenia if fever develops while the patient is taking prophylactic medication e If resources are available myelotoxic therapies, including bone marrow and SCT. Neutrophil recovery time was similar whether patients received early or delayed filgrastim therapy after transplantation (5) . In the Radiation Emergency Assistance Center Center/Training Site (REACT/TS) registry of radiation accident victims (http://www.orau.gov/reacts/ registry.htm), patients receiving filgrastim and sargramostim have had faster neutrophil recovery following radiation accidents. However, there was variation in the administration of these agents, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the clinical effectiveness of these agents following radiation exposure. For example, Gy many of the patients in the registry received both agents, patients received therapy at various intervals after exposure, and some patients received interleukin-3 (2, 5) . In contrast to the human studies, several studies involving rhesus macaques have demonstrated a shortening of the period of severe neutropenia following administration of colony stimulating factors within 1-2 days post-60-Cobalt irradiation (5) . Table 4 .8 contains the Strategic National Stockpile Radiation Working Group recommendations for cytokine treatment following exposure to ionizing radiation (2) . Once biodosimetry reveals that a patient has suffered from whole-body or significant partial-body exposure greater than 3 Gy (> 2 Gy for patients with multiple injuries or burns), or if clinical signs and symptoms reveal a level three or four degree of hematotoxicity (see Table 4 .9), clinicians should immediately begin cytokine therapy. Later, the clinician can adjust cytokine dosage based on other information, such as chromosome dicentrics. Although lab studies may reveal an initial granulocytosis followed by neutropenia, the patient should receive cytokine therapy continuously. Once the absolute neutrophil count rebounds from its nadir and reaches 1.0 \u00d7 10 9 cells L \u22121 , it is appropriate to discontinue cytokine treatment. However, monitoring should continue, and clinicians should resume cytokine treatment if the neutrophil count declines significantly (< 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 cells L \u22121 ) after discontinuation of initial cytokine treatment.",

In such events involving mass casualties, given the level of resources available, it may make sense to withhold cytokine treatment from these patients, especially if they also suffer from significant traumatic injuries or burns. Given that cytokines are expensive and critical resources requiring administration for long periods, physicians may have to make difficult triage decisions regarding their use. For example, it may be prudent to give cytokine treatment preferably to patients without additional injuries because of their greater chance for survival, such as adults under 60 with 3-7 Gy exposures and children and adults \u2265 60 with 2-7 Gy exposures.

Because bone marrow suppression is associated with immunosuppression, the cellular components must undergo leukoreduction and irradiation (25 Gy) to prevent transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease in the recipients. Clinicians caring for transfused patients may have trouble differentiating graft-versus-host complications from direct radiation-induced organ damage. Symptoms of both may include fever, pancytopenia, rashes, desquamation, diarrhea, and liver function abnormalities. In addition to preventing graft-versus-host disease, leukoreduction of the cell components before transfusion reduces the frequency of febrile nonhemolytic reactions, reduces the immunosuppressive effects of the transfusion and provides protection against platelet alloimmunization and cytomegalovirus infections (2).",

First, the time from exposure to onset of these symptoms is a useful component of exposure assessment. Secondly, the short onset time for clinically significant exposures makes prophylaxis for vomiting impractical. At low exposure doses, the duration of vomiting varies from about 48 to 72 h, making prolonged antiemetic therapy unnecessary. Prophylaxis for gastrointestinal ulceration is an additional component of supportive care. Physicians should avoid instrumentation of the gastrointestinal tract, since the mucosa is friable and likely to slough and bleed following instrumentation. Radiation victims exposed to doses greater than 10-12 Gy have virtually no chance for survival, and are therefore not candidates for definitive care. These patients should receive comfort measures rather than aggressive definitive treatment. Comfort measures should include analgesia, antiemetic agents and antidiarrheal agents. In addition, these patients, their families and their friends would benefit from psychological support and spiritual care.",

Once clinicians suspect ARS, if possible, they should document the specific source, and the time of onset and severity of symptoms. double gloves and shoe covers are required when evaluating and treating contaminated patients. In addition, staff should change gloves frequently to avoid cross contaminating other patients and staff. Staff should use appropriate radiation detection devices to detect contaminants in the hospital to facilitate removal and decontamination. After use, health care staff should remove their protective equipment, placing the equipment in clearly labeled, sealed containers. All health care workers who have adhered to the Oak Ridge guidelines have avoided contamination from handling radiation accident victims",
