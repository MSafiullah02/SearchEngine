They set out to habituate chimpanzees-to accustom them to human presence-in order to study their behavior (Boesch & Boesch-Achermann, 2000) . Their work has significantly contributed to our understanding of chimpanzee culture and cognition as well as human evolution. Moreover, Boesch and Boesch-Achermann made important observations on illness, on the disappearance of individual chimpanzees, and obtained biological samples that paved the way for future investigations of disease (Boesch, 2008; Leendertz et al., 2006) . These later investigations have led to the identification of numerous pathogens. Not only do they account for pathogens occurring naturally in the chimpanzees (e.g., STLV and SFV) and in the habitat (e.g., Ebola and Bacillus cereus bv anthracis), but also those introduced by humans, such as the human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (Boesch, 2008; Calvignac-Spencer et al., 2012; Formenty et al., 1999; Gogarten et al., 2014; K\u00f6ndgen et al., 2008; K\u00f6ndgen, Schenk, Pauli, Boesch, & Leendertz, 2010; Le Guenno et al., 1995; Leendertz, Boesch, Junglen, Since 1999 , TCP experienced at least six major respiratory disease outbreaks of human origin and with losses of up to 19% of the chimpanzee communities (K\u00f6ndgen et al., 2008) . Other projects have also published data on human respiratory pathogens infecting and, ultimately, killing several wild, habituated great apes (Gr\u00fctzmacher et al., 2016; Kaur et al., 2008; Palacios et al., 2011) . Such findings emphasize the inherent risk of proximity. In all of the reported outbreaks, the viruses detected were either HRSV or HMPV: two common human paramyxoviruses that generally cause only mild symptoms in healthy human adults (Falsey and Walsh, 2000; Webe, Mulholland, & Greenwood, 1998) .

Its mitigation is therefore, an ethical responsibility for habituation projects (Gruen, Fultz, & Pruetz, 2013) . However, preventing people from exposing wild habituated great apes to human pathogens is a challenge. In terms of potential pathogen exposure, both people from overseas who come to visit habituation sites as well as local staff on such projects routinely pose a risk to the health of wild great apes (Muehlenbein & Ancrenaz, 2009) . People who come to visit wild great apes from overseas are more likely to have been exposed to a variety of pathogens throughout their travel (e.g., in airports or airplanes) (Mangili & Gendreau, 2005) . Additionally, the stress of travel and changes in climate make them more susceptible to infection, leading to disease within few days after arrival at the destination where the great apes are encountered (Muehlenbein & Ancrenaz, 2009 ). Despite these different risk factors, eco-tourists frequently lack information about the relevance of their own health for the wildlife they intend to visit and, thus, may not take precautions or report illness (Muehlenbein & Ancrenaz, 2009 ). Finally, local project staff can also pose an increased risk when they come into frequent contact with children in their villages-a subpopulation with high respiratory disease prevalence (Walker et al., 2013) . The results show that international visitors represented 7 (39%) and local staff represented 11 (61%) of symptomatic subjects.

Although the possibility of false-negative results exists, it seems likely that if a person excretes these viruses in any relevant quantity-a quantity that would be sufficient for transmission to chimpanzees-it is likely to be detectable with the methods used here. Of course, the negative results for asymptomatic people are not surprising. For some respiratory viruses, however, pathogen excretion might start before the first symptoms occur. For example, 1-8% of influenza infectiousness occurs prior to illness onset (Lau et al., 2010) . Cases of asymptomatic shedding have been reported for HRSV and HMPV-the most common causative agents of respiratory disease outbreaks in wild habituated great apesbut this is believed to be a rather rare occurrence (Falsey, Erdman, Anderson, & Walsh, 2003) . That said, HMPV has recently been reported at two different great ape field sites in 1 out of 24 and 1 out of 42 apparently healthy staff members (Gr\u00fctzmacher et al., 2016) . Although asymptomatic infections must be taken into account as a risk factor, the absence of symptoms also limits the physical spread (e.g., the absence of cough or nasal discharge limit the excretion of the pathogen).

This is a common problem for diagnostics in human medicine as well (Bartlett, 2011; Bosch, Biesbroek, Trzcinski, Sanders, & Bogaert, 2013) . Beyond viruses and bacteria, the most frequent causative agents for acute respiratory illness, certain parasites, or funguses are also capable of triggering symptoms. More generally, infectious agents are not the only cause of respiratory symptoms (Boutayeb, 2006) . Non-infectious etiologies include allergies, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer, air pollution, wildfire smoke, and smoking.

In 2004, preventive measures were once again strengthened. Spitting in the forest and family members in the camps became prohibited. And, simultaneously, the wearing of surgical masks became obligatory when in the presence of chimpanzees. The step toward quarantine was first taken in 2008.
