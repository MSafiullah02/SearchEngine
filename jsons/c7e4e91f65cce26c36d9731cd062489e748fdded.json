The British public have taken this message to heart and to greater degree than anticipated with 71% saying they would now be nervous about leaving their homes even if businesses were allowed to reopen and travel restrictions were lifted 1 . There were fears initially that the NHS would be overwhelmed by Covid positive admissions and that our critical care units would run out of ventilators. This led to the rapid construction of nine Nightingale hospitals across the UK, all of which have since been stepped down. So, if the main thrust of staying at home was to protect the NHS then the slogan and the campaign can be judged to have been successful.",

We compared hospitalisation rates between boards by chi square test and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals where appropriate and correlated hospitalisation rates with population density using Pearson's correlation coefficient.

Dumfries and Galloway has the highest proportion of older adults in Scotland with 25% of the population aged 65 years or over 9 while ethnic minorities accounted for only 1% of the population at the 2011 census 10 . Corresponding figures for Greater Glasgow & Clyde are 16.2% over 65 in 2013 and 7.5% ethnic minorities in 2011 11 . Taken together it seems unlikely that these differences could account for a 30 fold difference in hospitalisation rates. Differences in population density, on the other hand, seem an altogether more plausible explanation, if for no better reason than that a low population density must make it easier to practice social distancing. We recognise, however, that population density cannot be the only explanation given the relatively high rate of hospitalisation in neighbouring Borders health board (Table 1) .",

Lockdown may well have prevented the NHS from being overwhelmed but has certainly been harmful in other respects: the economy remains shut down, the mental health of the nation is said to be suffering 12 and domestic violence is on the increase 13 . The UK government has said there are five conditions that require to be met before coronavirus lockdown can be lifted. These are that there should be sufficient critical care capacity; a sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths; evidence that the rate of infection is decreasing; that testing and PPE are able to meet demand; and that any relaxation of measures will not risk a second peak that overwhelms the NHS. It is our belief that a regional approach to easing restrictions may be logical if backed by real time data and that if regions such as ours are meeting these five criteria already we should not have to wait for parts of the country with higher levels of virus activity to do so before beginning the slow return to normality 14 .",
