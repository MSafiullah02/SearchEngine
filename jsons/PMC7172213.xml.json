            "text": "On June 19, 2010, a European shorthair feral kitten, 3 months of age, was presented at a veterinary clinic of Bari, Apulia region, Italy, with a soft subcutaneous swelling at the head from which a purulent material was oozing out. Anamnesis of the cat, including the vaccination history, was not known. At clinical examination, an alopecic area, 4 cm of diameter, was evident in correspondence to the subcutaneous swelling. The general health conditions were good and the appetite was preserved despite the presence of fever (39.8\u00b0C). The cat was discharged with a therapy consisting of oral administration of antibiotics (amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid 25 mg/kg q 12 h for 6 days). The day after the cat was again submitted to clinical examination due to the onset of neurological signs that consisted of ataxia and difficulty in standing and walking. Neurological examination revealed depressed postural reactions in all limbs, whereas oculo-vestibular responses, spinal reflexes, pain sensation and urinary and faecal continence were normal. Fever (40.0\u00b0C) and anorexia were also observed. New antibiotics were administered (enrofloxacin 5 mg/kg q 24 h, clindamycin 25 mg/kg q 12 h) in association with carprofen (2 mg/kg at q 48 h). Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-blood, serum and faecal samples were collected during the clinical examination for haematology, serum electrophoresis and immunochromatographic testing for detection of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) (Snap Feline Combo Plus; Idexx Laboratories, Westbrook, Maine, USA) and CPV/FPLV (Snap; Canine Parvovirus Antigen Test, Idexx Laboratories) antigens.",

Reductions of haematocrit (23.9%, RI 30\u201345%) and platelets (79 \u00d7 109\n cells/l, RI 175\u2013600 \u00d7 109\n cells/l) were also observed. Serum electrophoresis did not reveal any important modification of the serum proteins and FIV/FeLV testing was negative, whereas the Snap Canine Parvovirus Antigen Test gave a positive result. In the subsequent days, the cat underwent a progressive clinical improvement, regaining appetite and a normal rectal temperature and losing the neurological signs. On June 23, EDTA-blood, serum, nasal and faecal samples were collected and sent to our laboratory for further investigations. Five days later the kitten was presented again at the veterinary clinic with loss of appetite and diarrhoea and an antibiotic therapy was started with sulfamethopyrazine (30 mg/kg q 24 h). On July 2, the appearance of convulsions was observed with more than 10 episodes per day. By post-contrast computed tomography (CT), carried out using a Philips MX8000 MultiSlice CT scanner, a focal area of markedly enhanced signal intensity compatible with an intracranial abscess was evident in the left parietal region in close proximity to the subcutaneous abscess. An adjacent area of decreased signal intensity of possible oedematous origin was observed together with reduction of the third ventricle and deviation of the falx cerebri. In contrast, there were no cerebellar abnormalities, and no signs of recent, or old, fractures of the cranial bones. Abscess and cerebrospinal fluid samples for cytology, bacteriology and/or virology were not collected at the clinical examination nor during CT. Administration of phenobarbital (2.5 mg/kg q 12 h) resulted in the rapid recovery of the kitten and loss of the neurological signs. The abscesses underwent progressive adsorption leading to complete recovery.",

The presence of codon GAA at position 1276\u20131278 corresponding to residue E426 of the encoded protein led us to type definitively the strain as CPV-2c. The change A1275G was detected in the binding region of the type 2c-specific probe, which accounted for the absence of VIC fluorescence in the 2b/2c assay.16 This nucleotide change did not determine an amino acid substitution at residue 425 of the VP2 protein. The CPV-2c strain 300/10 of feline origin displayed the highest nucleotide identity (99%) to Italian type 2c strains displaying the same non-coding mutation at codon 425.6 By phylogeny obtained using the neighbor-joining method, strain 300/10 was found to fall in the same cluster as Italian type 2c CPVs (Fig 1\n), which was separate from that including a previous CPV-2c strain isolated from a cat with FPL.12 The maximum parsimony method confirmed the topology of the neighbor-joining tree.",

Apart from the occurrence of marked lymphopenia, the haematological findings were not typical of FPL as total WBC and neutrophil counts were increased as a consequence of the concurrent abscess, whereas FPL is usually characterised by a dramatic reduction of all leukocyte subsets. Clinically, the occurrence of diarrhoea was compatible with the parvoviral infection, whereas fever could be attributed to either FPL or suppurative process. The prevalent sign in the cat was the appearance of neurological disease which was characterised by ataxia and subsequently by convulsions. FPL may cause neurological disorders only in newborn kittens due to the virus replication in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum subsequent to perinatal infection. Thus, the major finding is represented by ataxia due to cerebellar hypoplasia.1 In the present case, ataxia was observed only in the early stage of the disease and was subsequently followed by severe seizures. In addition, the CT scanning showed focal lesions compatible with a parietal abscess without any involvement of the cerebellum, so that the neurological signs could be mainly attributed to the suppuration rather than to a viral infection. However, the recovery of the cat together with the lack of analyses on the cerebrospinal fluid prevented a definitive diagnosis for the neurological disorders. Although the clinical history and vaccination status of the cat were unknown, based on the low CPV-2c titres detected in the faeces and blood, it could be speculated that the cat was recovering from the infection when the neurological disease appeared. In this perspective, a preceding CPV-2c infection may have determined a general immunosuppression which could have been responsible for the parietal-brain colonisation by pyogenes.",

In the case reported in the present paper, there are no anamnestic data about previous vaccinations as the feral kitten was found already ill. This further detection of CPV-2c in a cat confirms the circulation of the new canine variant in the feline population, stressing again our recommendation to carefully evaluate the efficacy of classical FPLV vaccine against the CPV-2 antigenic variant.",
