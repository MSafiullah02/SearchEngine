This would be of assistance in searching for a cure or a vaccine. To justify these experiments, a chain of reasoning is presented that the Human ImmunodeEciency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) is a natural recombinant of Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) and Visna Virus, also known as Bovine ImmunodeEciency-like Virus (BIV) (1) . This natural recombinant was inadvertently transferred to humans through contaminated vaccine used to inoculate millions of Africans against smallpox during the smallpox eradication program conducted in sub-Saharan Africa in the late 1960s and most of the 1970s. These facts have serious implications not only for AIDS research but also for the new technology of 'pharming' (2, 3) , whereby genetically altered cows, sheep, goats and pigs are used to obtain human hormones, proteins, and other drugs.",

This theory proposes that the virus was then propagated through changing sexual mores, increased use of blood products in the practice of medicine and increased airplane travel. This seems unlikely, however, since the rural to urban migration in Africa has been going on for over 30 years. If HIV-l had been endemic in rural areas, the disease should have appeared well before 1980 in urban areas, and it didn't. The clinicians Biggar (15) interviewed do not believe they could have failed to recognize AIDS as a distinct clinical entity if it had existed prior to the late 1970s or early 1980s.",

Normally, it takes 4-S years (32) for symploms of the disease to manifest themselves from the date of the infection, but the virus can be transmitted at any time after it enters the animal's bloodstream. Because it is slow acting and there are no visible signs of the disease, many animals remain in the preclinical stage for their entire lifetimes (32) . Diagnosis before the onset of symptoms is by means of an ELISA (enzymelinked immunosorbent assay) test (35) for antibodies to BLV similar to one of the tests used for detecting antibodies to HIV-l in humans. When the infection finally appears, two of the most common symptoms are lymphadenopathy -enlargement of the superficial lymph nodes -and a chronic, persistent diarrhea (32) . After that, various cancers and diseases can infect the digestive tract, the heart, the nervous system, and other organs of the animal's body. This is similar to AIDS in humans.",

In short, any mechanism that can transfer blood or any lymphocyte containing bodily fluid into the blood stream of another cow or sheep can transmit this disease. Johnson (36) has shown conclusively that as little as 1 pl of blood (a fraction of a drop) from a seropositive cow injected into calves intramuscularly, intravenously, subcutaneously or intradermally causes se-reconversion within as little as 4 weeks after inoculation. In other words, a small blood to blood transfer or, more precisely, a small infected lymphocyte to blood transfer is enough to transmit BLV.",

It has been shown in the laboratory that true recombination occurs among the picornaviruses and the coronaviruses (63). Hahn, Lustig, E. Strauss and J. Strauss (67) have shown that westem equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), a 'successful' widespread virus which causes encephalitis in humans, is a natural recombinant of eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and a Sindbis-like virus. RNA recombination is now considered to be an important force in the evolution of all types of RNA viruses (63, 67) . In the special case of retroviruses which contain two molecules of single-stranded RNA and reverse transcriptase (RT) in their core, it has been shown (68) that they undergo the highest rate of recombination of any biological system known. (BLV, Visna, and HIV-1 are such retroviruscs.) A typical experiment is to infect a cell culture with two genetically different retroviruses and then examine the offspring after a few replication cycles. As many as 40% of the progeny can be found as recombinants (69) , in that all contain nucleotide sequences derived from each parent. Genetic experiments with two avian retroviruses (70,7 1) have shown that the frequency of recombinant virus from mixed infections exceeds 10%. Hunter (70) proposed the formation of a heterozygote virus from a coinfected cell which then would produce the recombinant virus during the second cycle of infection as shown in Figure 2. 2. HIV-1 contains sequences from both BLV and Visna as a natural recombinant would.",

Consequently, if HIV-l was already in the vaccinifcr, some of it would be in its epidermis. Vaccinia virus was grown in the epidermis of the vaccinifer, and even if the Vaccinia virus did not coinfect a cell already infected with HIV-l, some HIV-l contaminated cells would be picked up during the 'scooping out' of the infected portions of the vaccinifer's skin and transferred to the vaccine. It was standard procedure (74) to pool individual harvests from one animal with harvests from others to achieve a minimum volume for freeze-drying, and 400 doses of vaccine (0.0025 ml each) could be obtained from 1 ml of vaccine using bifurcated needles (4, ~569).

By constructing plasmids containing a foreign gene under the control of a Vaccinia virus promoter flanked by Vaccinia virus DNA, many foreign genes have been inserted in to Vaccinia and expressed from Vaccinia virus recombinants (82) (83) (84) (85) (86) . Panicali, Paoletti, and Perkus (87) (88) (89) (90) have shown that there are at least 13 sites on the Vaccinia genome where genes can be inserted without interfering with the ability of Vaccinia to replicate. They also showed that this integration of foreign genes into Vaccinia and their subsequent expression can be achieved without directly engineering Vaccinia promoters. It is, therefore, reasonable to conclude that the 2-LTR sequences on the plasmid form of HIV-1 could serve as the promoter for the integration of the entire 9749 bp HIV-l genome into the Vaccinia virus DNA. Because the Vaccinia virus genome is large, about 187 000 base pairs (82) , it has the capacity to accept genes containing as many as 25 000 base pairs (91) . Thus, there is more than adequate room for this integration to take place. Once it does, HIV-1 could be expressed in that cell or by the next cell that the Vaccinia/HIV-1 recombinant infects. This suggested mechanism would increase the con-2. It explains why the disease in Africa occurred centration of HIV-1 in the epidermis of the vaccinifcr with approximately equal frequency in men and beyond its concentration in the absence of the Vacwomen (92, 93) , since there were roughly equal numcinia infection.",

The animal or animals would have appeared healthy, but the BLV and Visna had already naturally recombined into HIV-l. The concentration of HIV-l in the epidermis of the vaccinifer may or may not have been increased during the 4 days of Vaccinia infection by the mechanism discussed in the previous section. In either case, the HIV-1 was then transmitted to the vaccine along with the Vaccinia virus and subsequently to humans during vaccination.",

The early date of this case suggests a conflict with this theory, but this is not clear. We do not know enough about Robert R's medical history. There have also been reports of positive antibody tests to HIV-1 in frozen blood samples from Africa prior to 1969 (96). However, this is not conclusive since these test results may follow from prior exposure to malaria or to human leukocyte antigen due to pregnancy (97) (98) (99) (100) .

This is perhaps the strongest argument against this theory. However, the creation of AIDS was a small likelihood event. It required the presence of both BLV and Visna in one animal, and it required the use of that animal as a vaccinifer for the production of Vaccinia virus. Furthermore, since the veterinary literature does not define BLV as a known virus until the late 1960s and early 1970s (105-109), since BLV is exogenous to cattle (1 lo), and since the first report of Visna in cattle did not occur until 1972, it may be that BLV and Visna simply were not present in the animals used as vaccinifers.",
