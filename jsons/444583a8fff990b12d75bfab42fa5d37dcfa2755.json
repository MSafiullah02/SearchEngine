Compartment model is the base and also a powerful mathematical framework for understanding the complex dynamics of epidemics. At present, Many researchers [1 \u2212 3] are increasingly interested in the influence of these behavioral factors on the spread of infectious diseases. Cooke and Driessche [4] proposed and investigated a classical SEIR epidemic model,which has became the most important model in diseases control. Therefore, ODEs,PDEs and SDEs are employed to study SEIR epidemic models, and some results could be found in literatures [5 \u2212 8] .. Zhao et al. [9] investigated an extended SEIR epidemic model with non-communicability in incubation period. National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China declared that the incubation period of the the COVID-19 is about ten days, the incubation period is infectious [10] . The COVID-19 outbreak in China presents that physical protection and social isolation are critical to controlling the epidemic in the absence of vaccines or antiviral drugs for the virus.",
