Though both live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines are used worldwide to control the disease, IBV occasionally outbreaks in endemic areas (Bijlenga et al., 2004, Cavanagh, 2003). The use of attenuated live-vaccines elicits local, systemic and cell-mediated immunity to the virus (Cavanagh, 2003, Raj and Jones, 1997), but poses a risk of residual pathogenicity associated with vaccine back-passage in flocks (Abro et al., 2012, McKinley et al., 2008, McKinley et al., 2011). Though the inactivated IB vaccines are relatively safe, they are efficacious only when used as boosters after priming vaccination with live vaccines (Ladman et al., 2002). Thus to develop a safer, more efficacious and economic vaccine candidate is of great interest for scientific research.",

The genome of IBV encodes four structural proteins, including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Cavanagh, 2007). People have found that the spike (S) protein, the largest structural protein, constitutes the characteristic club-shaped 16\u201321 nm projections that emerge from the virion surface and presents a corona-like appearance under electron microscopy (Cook et al., 2012). In addition, the S protein was suggested to have haemagglutinating activity that the entry of the viruses is mediated by sialic acid binding activity of the S protein (Schultze et al., 1992).",

It is intriguing for us to know whether recombinant hemagglutinin and S protein can also induce better immunogenicity and protective efficacy against IBV infections. In this study, we first investigated whether the recombinant S protein could induce better immune responses. Therefore, we generated a recombinant S1 (rS1) protein and two recombinant S1 fusion proteins, rS1-H3(TM) (fused with the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic tail (CT) of influenza H3N2 HA protein) and rS1-HA2 (fused with the HA2 domain of influenza H3N2 HA protein).

Recombinant baculovirus generation and infection were performed as previously described (Liu et al., 2013).

Other researchers displayed the S1 glycoprotein on the BacMam virus-based surface and presented that the BV-Dual-S1 protein elicited stronger humoral and cell-mediated immune responses (Zhang et al., 2014).

To improve the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of IBV S1 protein, here we generated two fusion proteins rS1-H3(TM) and rS1-HA2 from S1 protein of IBV and hemagglutinin of influenza virus H3N2. After challenged with virulent IBV M41 strain, our results demonstrated that fusion proteins performed better protection compared with inactivated M41 vaccine and recombinant rS1 protein alone, while the latter groups presented similar protection ratio. Thus, an augment of the humoral and cellular immune responses was suggested to be induced by the fused rS1-H3(TM) and rS1-HA2 proteins.",

Consist with the immunity protective test, in this study, the level of specific antibodies induced by the recombinant rS1-H3(TM) and rS1-HA2 was higher than the rS1 and inactivated M41 group. One interesting thing is that, two weeks after booster vaccination (day 28), the antibody level induced by recombinant S1 protein was lower than that of inactivated virus in our study. It is possible that the inactivated M41 vaccine, which is derived from native viruses, comprised almost all the epitopes of IBV and thus presented better performance in inducing a IBV-specific antibody response after booster vaccination.",

Some reports have demonstrated that the CD8+ CTL response are critical in the control of infectious bronchitis (IB) and more efficient than CD3+CD4+ helper T cells in controlling respiratory virus infections (Cook et al., 1991, Thompson et al., 1997). The CD4+ T-cell responses provide help for B-cells to mature and generate specific antibodies as well as directly antiviral cytokines, increase the proliferation, maturation, and functional activity of CD8+ CTL (Doherty et al., 1997, Kotani et al., 2000). In this study, we found an significant increase of the CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T lymphocyte subgroups in chickens immunized with rS1-H3(TM) and rS1-HA2, comparing to the rS1 and inactivated M41 vaccine groups. The ratio of CD3+CD8+ to CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes in chickens immunized with rS1-H3(TM) or rS1-HA2 was greater than that in chickens inoculated with rS1 and inactivated M41 vaccine. These findings indicate the advantage of employing fused S1 protein to TMs or HA2 of HA proteins in an effectively stimulating cellular immune responses, especially in promoting the CTL response, which is critical for virus clearance and recovery of chickens from IBV infections (Collisson et al., 2000).",
