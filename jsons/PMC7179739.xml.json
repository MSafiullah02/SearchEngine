The brain reportedly, like most other\norgans, expresses the hACE2 considered to be the entry point of the\nSARS-CoV-2 viruses in humans and is therefore not immune to viral infection.\nThough SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be detected in cerebrospinal fluid, SARS-CoV\nwith similar structural and functional features has been detected in the\ncerebrospinal fluid of patients, indicating the ability of the virus to\nbreach the extremely rigid blood\u2013brain barrier.4\nIf previous studies with other CoVs are taken into consideration, SARS-CoV-2\nlike its other family members will first infect the peripheral nerve\nterminals and then slowly crawl its way through the synapse-connected route\ninto the CNS.7 Previous studies in the relevant field\nwith SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV observed that they infiltrate the brains of\ntransgenic mice when administered intranasally.4 The\ninfiltration of the virus into the brain took place through the olfactory\nnerves, eventually affecting the thalamus and the brain stem. The brain stem\nwas eventually observed to be the worst infected.4 So,\nfollowing these experimental studies along with the hematologic spread of\nSARS-CoV-2 in CNS, retrograde neuronal transport of the virus through the\nvagal nerve afferents from the lungs into the CNS must be taken into\nconsideration.7 Also, with reports claiming\ninfection of the gastrointestinal tract by SARS-CoV-2, the virus could even\nuse the enteric nervous system and its sympathetic afferent neurons to reach\nthe CNS.7",

The olfactory mucosa is connected with the olfactory bulb\nthrough the cribriform plate, which is found at the very base of the frontal\nlobes of the brain.2 This very much explains the hyposmia\nand other neurological symptoms that are being increasingly observed in\nCOVID-19 patients (Figure 1). The\npoint to note here is that the long-term effects of the neuroinvasive nature\nof the virus may result in an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases\nwith involvement in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders like\nParkinson\u2019s disease or multiple sclerosis.7 The\nconditions are more likely to be worsened in COVID-19 patients with\npre-existing neurological disorders.",

In this hour of great distress, therapeutic interventions from\nscientists across the globe are needed in order to fight this pandemic\n(Figure 2). As discussed at\nthe beginning of this Viewpoint, we have made good progress in understanding\nthe key interactions between the hACE2 and the RBD of the spike protein in\nSARS-CoV-2.3 Hence, we could utilize that to\ndevelop some good antiviral intervention strategies. Some antibody drugs\ncould be designed following the epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Also, RBD\ncan itself be used to test its efficacy as a subunit vaccine.3 Since the nature of the interactions between RBD and\nhACE2 are protein\u2013protein interactions, designing of peptide-based\ntherapeutics could also be explored (Figure 2).9 Many more such\nstructure-guided therapeutics like small molecules or peptides that\ninterfere with the receptor recognition of the virus could possibly halt the\nprogression of the disease (Figure 2).9 In fact, inhibition of transmembrane\nserine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), the surface protease that cleaves the viral\nspike protein to unleash the full infective potential of the virus, also\nknown as the priming of the virus, was once considered to be an effective\ntherapeutic intervention to stop the viral spread only later to be dropped\nowing to the unknown physiological impact of TMPRSS2 blockade.7 Also patients with reported hyperinflammation caused by\nthe cytokine storm should be administered appropriate steroids, selective\ncytokine blockers like atlizumab, antibody therapy, and inhibitors of the\nJAK pathway.6",

            "text": "Another important feature, which we must consider before deploying treatment\nmodalities to patients, is the genetic predisposition and susceptibility of\nthe patient under consideration, which may vary at the population level\nacross variable geographical locations. A recent study published before the\nmassive outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe and the United States of America\n(USA) tried to screen for ACE2 mutants that would resist attachment of the\nS-protein of the virus in different populations but was not able to find any\ndirect evidence. But thereafter, as COVID-19 slowly engulfed the entire\nworld, a new study has indicated variations observed in the spike surface\nglycoprotein (Ala930Val) in the Indian SARS-CoV-2 strain as compared to the\nstrains from the USA, Italy, Wuhan, and Nepal.10 The same\nstudy also reported the presence of an antiviral miRNA, has-miR-27b, only\nunique to the Indian host population, which surprisingly even binds to the\nmutated region of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 strain.10 miR-27b\nis known to inhibit HIV-1 replication and is widely regarded as an antiviral\nmiRNA. The above claims of the study are further corroborated by the failure\nof anti-HIV regimens to cure patients in China while the same anti-HIV drugs\nseem to have worked in some Indian patients. Along with this, it is now\nbeing widely speculated by many that widespread Bacillus\nCalmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination in countries like India may\nhave boosted the immunity of the country\u2019s thriving population and\nmay be now serving as a protective shield against the widespread COVID-19\nattack across the world. Countries without such universal policies on BCG\nvaccination like Italy, the U.S., or the Netherlands are among the worst hit\nby COVID-19 infection. Unarguably such claims require more elaborate\nscientific proof to be accepted as facts, but ethnicity and regional\ndiversity do play a role in responding to such pandemics that can be\naffirmed without doubt. This only highlights the need for more genetic\nscreening and population-based genome-wide studies in divergent geographical\nregions in order to better understand the host\u2013pathogen interactions\nin a region-specific manner, which could pave the way for the genesis of\nmore region-specific therapeutics and treatment regimens.",

Moreover, these patients or patients with\nexisting neurological conditions should be monitored closely so that the\nsymptoms do not aggravate over the subsequent days of the infection. This\nstrategy could also be considered as a preliminary screening strategy in\ncase of large scale community transmission of COVID-19. The prevailing\nhealth care units taking care of infected patients must now include\nneurologists to gain more perspective into the nature of the infections,\nwhich have a high chance of turning out to be neurological. Meanwhile, more\nautopsies on brains of COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms need to\nbe performed to establish the neuroinfection track of the disease so that\nappropriate measures can be taken.
