The epidemic has spread all of the the country and the wold make a great threat to the public health. There were 114 countries had infected patients and 118 000 patients in total until March 11 th with a mortality of 3.6%. The first sequencing of the viral RNA gene was completed in January 3rd by Chinese microbiologists and medical experts. The CDC shared the new gene sequence of the coronavirus to the world in January 10 th . They developed and tested PCR diagnostic reagent which was wildly used in clinic since January 11 th [1] .The novel coronavirus pneumonia was caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV) which was renamed as SARS-CoV-2 in February 11 th by the the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the novel coronavirus of beta genus, with capsule, round or oval, 60-140nm in diameter and positive RNA virus. In vitro, sars-cov-2 can be found in human respiratory epithelial cells in about 96 hours [2] . Early novel coronavirus pneumonia patients had a history of Wuhan residence or contacted with the people from Wuhan, suggesting that there was interpersonal transmission [3, 4] . Covid-19 is a highly infectious disease. The R0 of covid-19 in early literature is 2.2 ~ 2.9 [1,5] and 3.77 in another study including 8 866 patients [6] . Therefore, early diagnosis, isolation and treatment of suspected cases are essential to control the epidemic. The detection of novel coronavirus nucleic acid is an effective method for rapid diagnosis [7, 8] . However when is the optimal upper respiratory tract sampling time is not sure. The optimal sampling time can help us to diagnosis in time at the same time to avoid the waste of the medical resources.",

All the suspected patients received the test of the samples of sputum, throat swab or secretion of lower respiratory tract by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR to show that sars-cov-2 nucleic acid was positive. 1.2.2 Data collection: The data was collected and obtained from the electronic case system which was came from official website of the Municipal Health Committee and the mainstream media of the city. All the data collected were reviewed by senior doctors in order to insure the accuracy. 1.2.3 Inclusion criteria: The patients were consistent with the diagnostic criteria and the following conditions: a: a clear history of Epidemiology (defined contact initiation and end time), b: single exposure, c: exposure time not exceeding 1 day. Exclusion criteria: a: history of multiple exposures. B: only one exposure but the time (from contact initiation to end time) was more than one day. c: without an unclear exposure time. 1.2.4 Grouping method: The patients were divided into the group before January 25 th including 106 patients and 150 patients in group after January 25 th .
