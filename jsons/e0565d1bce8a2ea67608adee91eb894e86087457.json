Recalculation with 2033 cases based on the refined estimate from China. However, this is falling short in predicting the spread of the pandemic and expansion within individual locations, suggesting that R is not likely to be 109 constant and likely to be dynamic for each outbreak location that results in underestimates of 110 the spread rate. This limitation is hindering epidemic dynamics as previously noted due to the 111 parameter is context specific and dynamic 1,2 . Hence, there is a need to rapidly estimate country 112 specific R values during the epidemic. This will provide global comparisons of expansion at 113 each location.",

Considering the lack of containment globally, except in Singapore, Hong Kong, and 127 Taiwan, we hypothesized that previously calculated R values do not provide reliable estimates 128 because they are more dynamic than is being considered and that influx of new cases and viral 129 mutation are likely sustaining expansion.

In this study, we used incidence data to derive R and compared country 147 specific COVID-19 infection dynamics with viral population genome diversity. By incorporating 148 R, epidemic curve timing, and viral genome diversity we created a systematic framework that 149 deduced how viral genome diversity can be used to describe epidemiological features of an 150 outbreak before new cases were observed. This was done by creating a genome diversity 151 metric that was directly and systematic integrated to provide context and allowed quantification 152 of the infection dynamics globally that are divergent from the early estimates with genomic 153 evidence.

Singapore is an excellent example of effectively 291 controlling and containing the COVID-19 outbreak. They previously designated a response 292 system called Dorscon (Disease Outbreak Response System Condition) 22 providing a 293 systematic approach to control so that they have not moved past the index phase. In contrast, 294 most other countries in this phase are poised to move into the takeoff phase (Fig 3) . The 295 transition into the takeoff phase signified a transition from a 2-day serial interval to a 7-day serial 296 interval that was more sensitive to shifts in the epicurve.",

Local transmission is captured by virus mutation as expressed in GENI 476 score values. GENI scores of SARS-COV2 isolates are relative to Wuhan reference strain Wuhan-Hu-1 NC_045512.2. The red line in the China epicurve represents the time before an 478 outbreak was determined yet genome sequences were circulating. The blue shaded curves 479 indicate GENE scores directly overlaid with the outbreak curve. The dotted line represents the 480 common point in time as a reference for visualization. The GENI score and epicurve show 481 similarity except in China as the outbreak advanced to takeoff and exponential the GENI score 482 increased while in the index stage example of Singapore the outbreak was contained and the Integration of genomic and classical epidemiology for outbreak investigation. The 486 foundation of epidemiology is the accurate and timely reporting of cases which enable the 487 calculation of the number. Genomic Identity (GENI) score is formulated from genomic data of 488 pathogens to differentiate imported cases versus local transmission and measure time of cryptic 489 spread. Together these two epidemic values deliver insight that can be directly used for making 490 decision criteria for public health intervention.",

By quickly sharing the genome sequences it enables investigation of 135 the genome variation during the outbreak using multiple approaches and samples of the virus 136 genome space. It is approaching a viral population scale, which provides additional information 137 that cannot be gleaned with few sequences. Prior work established the value of estimating 138 transmission dynamics of rapidly evolving RNA viruses and highlights the capability to infer 139 transmission during outbreaks coupled with pathogen genomes 11,12 . This approach was 140 validated in EBOV and MERS. Each virus variant is separated by only several mutations yet 141 produces new dynamics during the outbreak 13,14 . Rapidly evolving pathogens undergo genome 142 sequence mutation, selection pressure, random drift and stochastic events between infected 143 individuals 11 . Even small changes in the genome enable transmission that is determined by 144 accounting for the mutations between isolate sequences. It is recognized that the COVID-19",
