In the group with respiratory signs, both upper and lower clinical disease signs were observed. Upper respiratory disease signs included sneezing and increased upper respiratory sounds. Pulmonary signs included dyspnea and coughing. Thoracic radiographic images revealed pleural effusion and patchy pulmonary alveolar densities. In 1 case, lesions were found both in the lungs and in the nasal cavity (\nFIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). Digestive tract lesions were identified in the oral cavity, stomach (\nFig. 5), intestine (\nFig. 6), liver (\nFig. 7), spleen, a mandibular lymph node, and the mesenteric and hepatic lymph nodes (\nFig. 8).

            "text": "The question of the zoonotic potential of mycobacterial infection is a key element of the information provided to the owner and of the decision to treat or euthanize. Many mycobacteria can cause diseases in man. The zoonotic risk is clear for bacteria of the M. tuberculosis group. However, for bacteria of the M. avium group or for rapid growing bacteria such as M. fortuitum or M. chelonae, the actual zoonotic risk appears to be minimal for humans with normal immune systems. Most human infections with atypical organisms originate from the environment, and not from other humans or from animals.11, 29 Nevertheless, precise diagnosis is essential before discussing treatment with an owner.2 In the cases described in this article, owners were encouraged to pursue mycobacterial identification. In 11 cases where identification was achieved, all identified mycobacteria were atypical mycobacteria. The decision to treat should be made carefully, and in conjunction with the owner\u2019s physician. Several treatment protocols have been described in ferrets (Table 1). The ferrets in this report were primarily treated with fluoroquinolones, in particular, enrofloxacin. Enrofloxacin treatment has the advantage of being relatively inexpensive, easily accessible for veterinarians, and easy to administer by owners. In France, fluoroquinolones are considered critical antibiotics, and their use for infection prevention or for minor infections is discouraged; however their use for treatment of mycobacterial infections is likely justified. The use of human antituberculous drugs such as rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, rifabutin, or ethambutol could be considered, but there may be serious ethical concerns regarding the use of these drugs, as antibiotic resistance is of critical concern.25, 26 Another antibiotic to consider is azithromycin, which is well tolerated in ferrets and can be used in association with fluoroquinolones. Existing information regarding the typical susceptibility of each bacterium in humans can also help with antimicrobial selection. The use of interferon should also be investigated. It has been suggested that interferon-gamma may play an important role in host resistance to mycobacteria.30, 31 Human interferon alpha-A, which is inexpensive and easy to use, has proved useful in containing or treating other ferret diseases such as systemic coronavirus infection (authors\u2019 personal observations) and should be investigated as a concurrent treatment for mycobacteriosis. The slow growth of mycobacterial organisms necessitates long-term treatment, in some cases, many months. Gauging treatment success is difficult. In the cases assessed in this case series, treatment ended with the death of the animal or after more than 1 year without return of clinical disease signs.",

Mycobacteriosis may infect ferrets more commonly than once previously thought; it is also likely being underdiagnosed. The aim of the article is to illustrate the polymorphous aspect of the disease and the number of cases diagnosed at the veterinary clinics involved. Veterinarians should include mycobacteriosis in their differential disease diagnoses of ferret patients that present with eyelid swelling, upper and lower respiratory disease, and digestive diseases. For cases of abdominal pyogranulomatous lesions, mycobacteriosis should also be considered along with systemic coronavirus infection.",
