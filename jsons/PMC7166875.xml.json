The HIV virus and contemporary human influenza viruses are prominent examples of viruses that have crossed the species barrier and established themselves permanently in the human population without further dependence on the presence of the original animal host reservoir. Fortunately, natural adaptation of a new virus leading to permanent establishment and dissemination within the human population is a rare event 8. Often, the virus is not readily adapted to infect and spread efficiently from human to human. The emergence of new viral infections often follows environmental, ecological and technological changes caused by human activities 9. These activities may lead to an increased contact between humans and animal hosts acting as reservoirs of zoonotic viruses. Agricultural development, an increased exploitation of environmental resources, growth and increase in the mobility of the human population and trade and transportation of food and livestock, have been identified as important factors contributing to the introduction and spread of a number of new viruses in the human population 10, 11, 12, 13.",

RNA genomes are replicated by RNA polymerases that lack proofreading. Therefore, mutations in RNA viruses can occur up to a million\u2010fold more frequently than in DNA viruses 16, 17. As a consequence, RNA viruses generally evolve more rapidly, and lead to genetic heterogeneity and the presence of so\u2010called viral quasispecies 18. The concept of quasispecies states that in an infected host, the virus exists as a population of genetically related but divergent variants defined by a master sequence and a complex and dynamic series of mutant sequences. While the master sequence remains the predominant sequence present within the population, the spectrum of mutants may shift in response to selective pressures. From the quasispecies population a variant may be selectively expanded 19, 20, 21.",

CPV\u20102 differs from FPV by only two nucleotide substitutions within the capsid gene resulting in two amino acid substitutions 28. These changes are associated with the ability of CPV\u20102 to bind to the canine transferrin receptor with high affinity 29.

This implies that variants of CPV gradually arose due to further adaptation and selection in dogs, in reaction to selective, most likely immunological, pressure. The two new variants (types 2a and 2b) differ at 5 or 6 amino acid from CPV\u20102 isolates 30. At present, the two variants are still endemic in the canine population. These two variant viruses have an expanded host range compared to the original CPV\u20102 since they replicate in cats in both experimental settings and in the wild although with no or relatively low pathogenicity 31, 32. Remarkably, the prevalence of CPV\u20102a and CPV\u20102b and new antigenic variants (CPV\u20102c) has now been demonstrated in a wide range of feline populations worldwide (reviewed in 33).",

Based on their genomic organization and phylogenetic analyses it is clear that HIV\u20101 and HIV\u20102 fall into two different SIV lineages 37.

However, to date, no serological or genetic evidence of widespread prevalence of HIV\u20101\u2010related strains exists in chimpanzees in the wild in Africa.

The following years passaging between infected humans of partially adapted SIV strains may have resulted in series of cumulative mutations and genetic changes. The large genetic differences that exist between SIV and HIV indicate that the initial SIV strains that crossed the species barrier must have undergone adaptation in humans in a relatively short period of time. This suggests the involvement of some modern iatrogenic event. Massive vaccination programs carried out at that time using non\u2010sterile injection needles may have provided opportunities for transmission and further adaptation of the virus to humans in Africa 48, 49.",
