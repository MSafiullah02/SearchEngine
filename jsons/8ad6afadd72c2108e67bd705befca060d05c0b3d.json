While there have been many simulations of droplet evaporation to determine whether droplets containing virions remain floating in air or rapidly fall to the ground, they typically conceal the fundamental mechanisms because of the use of numerics. To make the physics of emitted oral fluid droplets easily understood, we present simple and transparent algebraic equations that capture the essential physics of the problem. Calculations with these equations provide a straightforward way to determine the airborne lifetime of emitted droplets after accounting for the decrease in droplet size from water evaporation. At a relative humidity of 50%, droplets with initial radii larger than about 50 \u00b5m rapidly fall to the ground while smaller, potentially-virus containing droplets shrink in size and remain airborne for many minutes. Rough estimates of airborne virion emission rates while speaking support the proposal that covering the mouth can help end the pandemic more quickly.",

It is a subject that has aroused renewed interest because of the Covid-19 pandemic and has motivated scientists to perform new kinds of experiments. Just published laser light-scattering experiments of Anfinrud et al. (13) show that the number of oral fluid droplets are emitted into the air while speaking is orders of magnitude larger than previously detected using less sensitive methods (9) and that blocking such droplets is easily accomplished with a cloth mouth cover (13)(youtu.be/qzARpgx8cvE). Previous physics calculations of droplet evaporation to determine whether droplets containing viruses remain floating in air or rapidly fall to the ground typically involve numerical simulations, which hide the fundamental mechanisms (5, 14, 15) . In addition, the mathematics employed is too complex to be understood by other than physical scientists.

First, how long does it take for a viruscontaining droplet of a given size to fall to the ground by gravity to potentially contaminate a surface? Second, for each relative humidity, how much time does it take for water evaporation to reduce a virus-containing droplet to a size that leaves it floating in air for a sufficiently long time to allow direct transmission of the virus to another person? The answer to the first question is easily obtained by simply equating the gravitational and Stokesian viscous forces on a falling object (mg = 6\u03c0\u03b7Rv) to obtain the terminal velocity (v). This simplistic treatment is justified in ref. (16) . The mean time for a particle to reach the ground is then:",

The most important effects to consider in the size regime of interest are the cooling of the droplet from the heat loss due to water evaporation, which slows the evaporation rate, and the osmotic effect of the soluble droplet contents, that reduces the water vapor pressure at the droplet surface and therefore decreases the evaporation rate. Oral fluid, which is primarily saliva, contains about 99% by volume water, with the remaining 1% of volume consisting of proteins, mucus, epithelial cells, white cells, electrolytes, small molecules (17) , and possibly a virion. We assume that ~1% volume of water is strongly bound to the solutes. The volume fraction of non-volatile solute, which includes the strongly bound hydration water, is then about \u03a60 = 0.02. Dehydration of the droplet in less than water vapor-saturated air results in a so-called \"droplet nucleus\" (dn), which retains additional water. Balance of the water vapor pressure of the droplet and the ambient air results in an equilibrium solute volume fraction of \u03a6dn = 1 -RH, where RH is the relative humidity. Thus, for RH = 0.5, the initial droplet radius can maximally decrease due to evaporation by about a factor of ( )",

At the same time, non-linear hydrodynamic effects produce a flow boundary layer around the droplet outside of which viscosity effects are negligible. Using double boundary layer theory (16) , the evaporation for Ro > 60 \u00b5m is shown to be even faster than predicted by equation (3) .

            "text": "Given the many contents of saliva, in addition to the possibility of a virion, we estimate that the smallest possible radius before evaporation is ~1 \u00b5m. Table 1 shows the calculated values for initial droplet radii (R0) from 1 to 20 \u00b5m, which predicts that the number of emitted virions while continuously speaking ranges from 2 to ~10 4 per minute. Comparing the evaporation times at a relative humidity of 50% with the sedimentation times in Table 1 shows that for all radii in this range droplet nuclei remain airborne for times sufficiently long that their airborne lifetime will be determined by the turnover time of the air handling system. It is not known what fraction of the virions in these concentration measurements are infectious, but it has been argued that in some systems as few as a single active virion can cause an infection (19) . The very large range of virion emission rates in Table 1 calls for both an accurate determination of the fraction of airborne virions that are infectious, as well as accurate droplet size distributions at the high rate of emission determined by laser light scattering (13) . Measurements of droplet sizes at these high rates are currently underway at NIH. Table 1 . Theoretical virion emission rates (k), sedimentation times (\u03c4sed) at z0 = 1.5 m, and evaporation times (t(Rdn)) at 25 0 C for initial radii (R0) and for droplet nuclei at 50% relative humidity (RH = 0.5). Overall, the above analysis strongly supports the concept that simply speaking can be a major mechanism of Covid-19 transmission and that covering the mouth in public, as suggested by the work of Anfinrud et al (13) (youtu.be/qzARpgx8cvE) and others (12, 20) , could help to more rapidly contain and potentially end the pandemic. It also suggests that mouth covering is a more effective way of reducing transmission than maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet from another person. This conclusion is strongly supported by epidemiological evidence. The All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Even more convincing is Vietnam, where the total number of reported deaths is zero and wearing a mask is mandatory in public places for the entire population of 94 million. Finally, Austria and Germany, where face masks are required, are the only large non-Asiatic countries where there is marked slowing in the rate of new cases (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).",

Thus, droplets with an initial radius of Ro= 20 \u00b5m will shrink to a droplet nucleus radius of ~7 \u00b5m in t(Rdn) \u2248 2 s (equation 4), with the droplet nuclei remaining airborne for about 4 minutes (equation 1).It is useful to define a \"critical radius\", 0crit R , where the evaporation and settling times are equal, i.e. t(Rdn) = \u03c4sed. 0 crit R is obtained by combining equations (1) and (3) (with Rdn = R0/3)",
