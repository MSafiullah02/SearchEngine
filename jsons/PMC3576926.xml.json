            "text": "As the first line of defense, the innate immune response consists of both cellular and humoral components. The cellular component encompasses multiple cell types that use pattern recognition molecules to recognize and remove pathogens and cellular debris. The interactions of pattern recognition molecules within the cellular component have received significant attention in the last two decades. In contrast, less is known about the interactions between the humoral components. The humoral innate immune response consists of the serine protease cascades of the complement and contact systems as well as naturally occurring antibodies (NAb) and pentraxins. Recent data indicate that each component may be beneficial or detrimental during infection or chronic disease depending on concentration and interactions with other components. This review will focus on the interactions and roles of humoral components in bacterial and viral infections as well as the chronic diseases, atherosclerosis and cancer.",

            "text": "Complement activation occurs by one of three initiation pathways, the classical, alternative, or mannose binding lectin (MBL) pathway. Each pathway contains a C3 convertase that cleaves C3 producing C3b and subsequently a C5 convertase. Cleavage of C5 by the C5 convertase results in C5b deposition and initiates the common terminal pathway. The terminal pathway forms the membrane attack complex (MAC), a pore in the cellular membrane, and lysis of the host or pathogenic cell. The action of the C3 and C5 convertases also produces potent anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5. Although not specifically part of the humoral immune response, complement receptor 3 (CR3) found on neutrophils and macrophages enhances the innate immune response by recognizing C3b opsonized pathogens. Recent evidence indicates that complement plays a significant role in directing the adaptive immune response as well as in tissue regeneration [1], [2]. Specifically, as part of the B cell receptor complex, CR2 recognition of cleavage products iC3b, C3dg, and C3d significantly increases Ab production [3]. Thus, maintaining homeostasis requires tight regulation of the cascade. Regulation of this potentially damaging cascade occurs at multiple levels with soluble and membrane bound inhibitors including C1 inhibitor (C1INH), CD55, CD59, CD46, Factor H and related proteins.",

            "text": "The plasma also contains components of a second proteolytic cascade, the contact system. Factor XII (FXII; Hageman factor) of the contact system is proteolytically cleaved to FXIIa by negatively charged surfaces of damaged cells. FXIIa initiates the coagulation cascade leading to clot formation and cleaves prekallikrein to kallikrein for subsequent release of bradykinin. Through an endothelial G-coupled receptor (bradykinin receptor 1; BKR1), bradykinin induces vasodilation, neutrophil chemotaxis and vascular permeability [4]. Furthermore, the bradykinin degradation product, des-arg9-bradykinin regulates the adaptive response and alters the blood\u2013brain barrier through a second receptor, bradykinin receptor 2 (BKR2) [5]. Importantly, both FXIIa and kallikrein activate the complement cascade independent of known complement initiators [6]. Several components of the activated contact system including, FXa, FXIa and plasmin, cleave C5 and C3 producing C5a and C3a [7]. The complement inhibitor, C1INH, also inhibits FXIIa indicating multiple interactions between the two pathways [6]. These data suggest crosstalk between two cascades of humoral innate immune response.",

            "text": "As a family of evolutionarily conserved multimeric pattern recognition proteins, pentraxins are acute phase proteins which are rapidly synthesized and serve as markers of infection, inflammation, and tissue damage [11]. Each pentraxin contains a common domain in the C terminus. The presence or absence of additional domains divides the family into long or short pentraxins, respectively. The short pentraxins include C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid P protein (SAP), both of which are produced by the liver [11]. Produced by a multitude of cell types, pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is the primary long pentraxin active in humoral innate immunity. Similar to NAb, pentraxins recognize and bind multiple pathogens as well as intrinsic ligands, including apoptotic cells and extracellular matrix components [12], [13], [14]. Macrophages and other innate immune cells recognize pentraxins, CRP, SAP and PTX3, via Fc\u03b3 receptors [15], [16], [17]. Binding of pentraxins to a target facilitates clearance of pathogens and cell debris by complement activation indicating additional interactions between components of the innate immune response [12]. Overall, pentraxins are multifunctional and nonredundant components of the humoral innate immune response. Therefore, pentraxins play a critical role in human disease by interacting with multiple components of the humoral response.",

Similarly, other bacterial proteins directly inhibit C3 convertase [29], [30] or MAC formation [31]. Additional bacterial enzymes degrade critical complement components including the anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a. This prevents chemotaxis of phagocytic cells towards the site of infection. E. faecalis, a leading nosocomial pathogen, produces gelatinase, an enzyme that directly cleaves C5a, preventing neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection [32]. Due to incomplete complement activation, each of the above mechanisms frequently allows bacterial proliferation and deleterious effects on the host. A better understanding of the bacterial proteins that inhibit complement activation may lead to therapeutics that also curb excessive complement activation.",

Bacterial activation of the contact system releases kinin which in turn leads to the production of potent anti-microbial peptides and recruits other immune components to the site of infection [33], [34]. Despite activation of the immune response, kinin release and subsequent vasodilation may favor the bacteria due to an influx of plasma nutrients to the site of infection and increasing microcirculation of bacteria [34]. A massive activation of the contact system also causes excessive consumption of thrombin which results in hypovolemic shock and sepsis-induced coagulation [35]. Bacteria initiate the contact cascade and induce kinin release by a) producing proteases to degrade kininogens; b) activating FXII; or c) using structural elements and surface proteins that activate the contact cascade [36], [37], [38]. Several pathogens, including Porphyromonas gingivalis\n[39], Staphylococcus aureus\n[5] and S. pyogenes\n[40], produce proteins that degrade kininogens to kinins, with or without the release of bradykinin. As expected, the excess kinin release results in an array of pathological complications for the host.",

Viruses evade the host immune response by a) modifying C1q or C3; b) entering host cells; or c) using host or virally produced complement inhibitors to prevent cell lysis. Viral proteins directly interact with the components of the complement cascade to disrupt complement-mediated destruction. C1q and C3 are frequent targets of the viral proteins. For example, the coat protein of human astrovirus type 1 binds C1q, displaces the C1r/C1s tetramer and inhibits the activation of the classical complement pathway [64]. Similarly, the matrix (M1) protein of influenza A virus binds C1q but this viral protein blocks the interaction between C1q and IgG [65]. Many other viruses modulate C3 as a central component of the complement cascade. West Nile virus synthesizes two isoforms of NS1 protein to regulate C3. Soluble NS1 increases Factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b to iC3b while the cell surface-bound NS1 decreases deposition of C3b and MAC [66]. Herpes virus synthesizes trans-membrane glycoprotein gC1 and gC2, which bind C3b and specifically accelerate the decay of the alternative C3 convertase and inhibit the interaction of C3b with C5 and properdin [67], [68]. Together these studies indicate that viruses interact with multiple complement components to prevent complement-mediated host cell death.",

In vitro studies demonstrated that the viral inhibitory proteins block C3 deposition by both the classical and alternative activation pathways [69]. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus, herpes virus saimiri, variola virus, vaccinia virus, monkeypox virus and ectromelia virus also encode regulators of the complement cascade which bind C3b or C4b and block activity [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77]. Other viruses recruit host complement regulatory proteins to virions to evade complement-mediated destruction. Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), human T-lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) incorporate the complement control proteins CD55 and CD59 into their virions to circumvent the complement response [78], [79].

Moreover, NAb present in IVIg bind CCR5 to inhibit CCR5-tropic HIV infection in macrophages and lymphocytes.",

They also show limited neutralization, opsonization and complement binding ability compared to specific Ab of the adaptive response. Early in influenza virus infection, NAb bind to the hemagglutinin molecules of influenza A and B, neutralize the viruses and provide initial protection before the emergence of antigen-induced Ab produced by the adaptive response [92], [93], [94]. High titers of influenza virus occur in the lungs of mice which do not secrete IgM, and in the absence of soluble IgM NAb, the survival rate decreases significantly compare to wildtype mice [95]. The broad spectrum of NAb reactivity allows pre-infection sera to bind at least 12 influenza A and B strains. However, the level of influenza specific NAb does not increase as the disease progresses. These data demonstrate that NAb are distinct from antigen-induced Ab. NAb also inhibit CCR5-tropic HIV infection. IVIg contains anti-CCR5 Ab which inhibits HIV-1 infection of human macrophages and CD4+ T cells by CCR5-tropic but not CXCR4-tropic HIV-1. IVIg also contains NAb directed against multiple other cell surface molecules, including CD4, CD5, adhesion motif and CD95 [96]. These data indicate that NAb are an important part of the innate humoral immune response to viruses.",

As described earlier, the classic short pentraxins, CRP and SAP, are generally accepted as indicators of infection. But similar to bacteria, the prototypic long pentraxin PTX3 rapidly increases in response to viral infections. As a better protein marker of dengue virus infection than CRP [97], PTX3 also demonstrates antiviral functions in human or murine cytomegalovirus (HCMV or MCMV) and influenza virus. In these studies, PTX3 binds viruses and inhibits viral-cell fusion and internalization [98]. In influenza infection, sialylated ligands on PTX3 mimic the structure of the cellular receptors and bind the viral hemagglutinin glycoprotein and block the receptor-binding site of hemagglutinin [99]. Thus, pentraxins recognize and bind viral antigens to initiate the humoral innate immune response. However, the specific role of pentraxins in viral infection has not been well studied.",

These networks crosstalk with each other to recognize and eliminate invading viruses. However, viruses use numerous strategies to evade the immune response by compromising multiple proteins of the innate response simultaneously. Further efforts should examine the signaling pathways that modulate each component. Due to the complex interactions between components of the humoral response, future studies may need to examine the virus/host interactions together and not as individual components. Comprehensive research on antiviral mechanisms of the host and viral evasion mechanisms will provide insight into pathogenesis and novel treatment options.",

For example, complement plays a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Compared to non-atherosclerotic arteries, fibrous plaques up\u2010regulate transcripts of the classical complement cascade proteins [100]. Additionally, deposition of classical complement proteins, including C1q, C3, C4 and MAC occurs in atherosclerosis [101]. The alternative complement pathway is also implicated in plaque development or atherogenesis. For example, plasma from mice with high-fat diet-induced atherosclerotic lesions contained elevated C3, properdin and factor D levels [102]. Endotoxin- and diet-induced atherosclerosis in LDL receptor-deficient mice also requires the alternative pathway, factor B [103]. Importantly, C6 deficiency protects against diet-induced atherosclerosis, indicating that the terminal complement pathway is required in progression of atherosclerotic lesions [104]. Indeed, MAC deposition correlates with the severity of arterial damage in human aortic fibrous plaque [105] and in mice, MAC deposition promotes endothelial damage [106]. Endothelial MAC deposition also preceded monocyte infiltration and foam cell formation in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis [104]. Together, the data indicate that multiple complement pathways of activation increase the risk of atherosclerosis.",

Other in vitro studies indicated that IgM NAb recognized malondialdehyde, malondialdehyde low density lipoprotein (LDL) and oxidized LDL. The recognition of oxidized LDL prevented macrophage uptake, inhibited foam cell formation and atherogenesis [109], [111], [112]. However, under other conditions such as myocardial infarction, NAb are pathological. Compared to wildtype mice, Ab deficient mice experience significantly less tissue damage in response to myocardial infarction. Importantly, administering a single NAb clone restores tissue damage and inflammation to the Ab deficient mice [113], [114]. In addition, peptide inhibition of the NAb binding attenuates myocardial infarction induced injury in wildtype mice [113]. NAb play a key role in the modulation of atherosclerosis by clearing apoptotic cells and oxidized structures; however, excessive complement activation in response to NAb binding may be detrimental and cause pathology.",

Detectable in the arterial wall in the early stages of atherogenesis, CRP continues to accumulate with disease progression [100]. By inhibiting endothelial production of nitric oxide, CRP impairs vasodilation and angiogenesis [119] and facilitates endothelial cell apoptosis, leading to atherosclerotic lesion formation. In addition, by increasing the expression and activity of endothelial cell plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a fibrinolysis inhibitor, CRP potentially contributes to plaque instability and atherothrombosis [120]. CRP also enhances endothelial cell adhesion molecules [121], superoxide production [122] and promotes monocyte recruitment into the plaque [12], all of which may contribute to atherogenesis. CRP also binds to enzymatically modified or oxidized LDL; however, the beneficial nature of this binding remains controversial in the clinical setting [123], [124]. A meta-analysis of a large multi-nation statin trial found that increased CRP levels identified only a limited population at risk with no clinical outcomes [125]. Thus, additional clinical studies are required prior to increased CRP screening of the population.",

By binding amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and serum amyloid component A (SAA), SAP mediates the inflammatory response to amyloid fibrils in atherosclerosis [130]. In contrast, SAP binds and prevents the uptake of oxLDL by macrophages, possibly reducing foam cell formation [131]. Similar to CRP and SAP, elevated expression of PTX3 precedes atherosclerotic lesion development [132] and correlates with acute myocardial infarction [133]. PTX3 increases tissue factor expression in endothelial cells, potentially inducing atherothrombosis [134]. Together, these results indicate a causal role of pentraxins in atherogenesis, suggesting that they may be effective therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis.",

The humoral innate immune components play a pivotal role in the progression of this chronic disease. Activation of each component may drive atherogenesis; whereas NAb may also protect against atherosclerosis by binding to oxidation-specific epitopes. It should be noted that these components do not act independently but interact with each other, collectively modulating the disease progression. Further research is warranted to examine the integrated role of these humoral innate immune components in atherosclerosis. Such insights may yield a new understanding of the mechanisms underlying this disease and lead to novel therapeutic approaches to attenuate the progression of atherosclerosis.",

These results may be linked to the anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a, which participate in several signal transduction pathways linked to tumorigenesis (Fig. 3\n). The binding of C3a and C5a to their receptors increases IL-6, which induces transcriptional changes in cell cycle progression and inhibits apoptosis [146], [147]. Specifically, C3a receptor (C3aR) and C5a receptor (C5aR) activate MAPK, ERK, phosphatidylinosityol 3-kinase and Akt [148], [149]. Each of these signal transduction pathways may mediate oncogenic transformation and progression. Similar pathways may also be activated by the MAC to induce cellular proliferation [139], [150], [151].

In healthy individuals, myeloid-derived suppressor (MDS) cells differentiate to macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils [152], [153]. However, when trapped in the intermediate stage of differentiation, MDS cells may mediate tumor-induced immune suppression [152], [153]. Tumor secreted factors induce pro-inflammatory mediators such as C5a, which recruit C5aR+ MDS to the tumor cells and disrupt normal differentiation of MDS cells (Fig. 3) [145]. Binding of C5a to C5aR on MDS increases reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that contribute to cell-mediated immunosuppression [145]. These complement stimulated MDS cells also prevent the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, inhibit Natural Killer cell cytotoxicity, stimulate cytokine production for tumorigenesis and increase angiogenesis [154], [155]. The complement system proteins such as C5a provide inflammatory protection in the tumor microenvironment.",

An abnormal anti-CD176 titer correlates with primary carcinomas [161]. B1a cells produce NAb against CD176, as a form of immunosurveillance against CD176+ cancer cells [162]. Anti-CD176 NAb induce apoptosis in surface CD176+ cells [162]. Tumor cells escape Ab-dependent cytotoxicity by releasing soluble CD176 to bind NAb and protect the tumor cell from apoptosis [161], [163]. Although expression of CD176 is important for recognition of cancer cells, soluble CD176, secreted by tumor cells, prevents Ab dependent elimination. Tumor cells use the innate immune system and NAb to avoid immunosurveillance and elimination.",

The primary PA studied in relation to cancer metastasis is the urokinase-type (u-PA) which generates plasmin for the degradation of ECM [181]. Compared to the normal or benign tissue, malignant tumors produce elevated levels of u-PA [182]. U-PA and/or the receptor, U-PAR are prognostic markers in human malignancies, including breast cancer [183], lung cancer [184], [185], bladder cancer [186], bone marrow [187] stomach cancer [188], colorectal [189] and cervical cancer [190]. The binding of u-PA to its receptor u-PAR appears to be necessary for cancer metastasis [191], [192].

As an example, the binding of u-PA to u-PAR generates plasmin for the activation of the latent form of TGF-\u03b2, which regulates other cellular functions, including PAI-1 [193], [194]. The migration and invasion of cancer cells requires changes in cadherin and integrin expression and binding which leads to alterations in the expression of u-PA, u-PAR and PAI-1 [195]. For example, cancer cell detachment requires a down-regulation of E-cadherin expression [196], which increases expression of u-PA and invasiveness in vitro [197].",

Bradykinin and hydroxypropyl-(Hyp) bradykinin are elevated in the blood plasma, peritoneal and pleural fluids of cancer patients [198], [199]. Bradykinin is the most potent permeability factor and pain inducer produced in the tumor microvasculature. The elevation in bradykinin mediates the enhanced vascular permeability which allows cell invasion in cancer patients [200], [201]. BKR2 is also upregulated in human and rodent cancer tissue [90]. The kallikrein cascade is also implicated in tumor formation. Matsumura et al. [202] showed that the continual generation of kinins stimulated proliferation of tumor cells through mitogenic actions and promoted diapedesis to enhance tumor cell metastasis [202]. Together, these data indicate that the contact system supports cell migration and invasion through multiple interactions with u-PA, u-PAR, PAI-1, kallikrein, kinins, ECM proteins, integrins, receptors, and growth factors that allow reorganization of the tumor microenvironment.",
