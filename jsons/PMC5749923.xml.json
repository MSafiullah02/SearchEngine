Rapid demographic turnover, where new susceptible individuals are added to a population at high rates, leads to a greater probability of maintaining disease and sustaining epidemics over longer periods of time44,45. Modern day beekeepers do just that, by replacing succumbed colonies with new ones, thus artificially replenishing the population with susceptible hosts. This practice is facilitated by the use of \u2018package\u2019 bees (one queen with several pounds of workers) and \u2018nucleus\u2019 colonies (small colonies with a queen, 1\u20132 pounds of bees, and 4\u20135 combs of brood), hundreds of thousands of which are shipped annually to beekeepers for restocking dead colonies. This results in very different demographic dynamics relative to natural disease systems, where susceptibles are used up as an epidemic burns through a population.",

Even wild honeybee colonies naturally have high within-colony individual densities, in turn creating naturally high disease pressure68. In the context of host heterogeneity, this seems to be exacerbated by genotypic homogeneity: all of the individuals within a colony are siblings, borne from the same mother (the queen). But honeybees have an unusual mating system: queens are highly polyandrous, mating with an average of 12 males69, allowing for relatively high within-colony genotypic diversity and a measure of resistance heterogeneity. Colonies headed by queens fertilized by greater numbers of drones can experience lower infestation rates with the American foulbrood bacterium Paenibacillus larvae, the chalkbrood fungus Ascosphaera apis, and the Varroa mite70\u201372. This is probably due to the presence of genetically resistant individuals within a colony. Thus, increasing genotypic variability within honeybee colonies could provide an effective way to control parasites.",

We know little about the potentially wide range of social immune mechanisms in honeybees and how to support those mechanisms via management, but some studies have begun to address this topic.

In honeybee pupae with mixed infections of Kashmir bee virus, sacbrood virus and black queen cell virus, inactivation of the first two viruses resulted in activation of the third, suggesting antagonistic interactions between viruses99. By contrast, co-inoculation of experimental bees with Nosema ceranae increased the infectivity of acute bee paralysis virus100, possibly due to honeybee immune suppression by N. ceranae101. Beyond the individual level, co-infections are common at the colony level in honeybees, including different species of viruses, microsporidians, bacteria and mites7,32,102. Increasing numbers of the nest-invading small hive beetle Aethina tumida are associated with decreasing levels of Varroa103. In contrast, co-infection with Varroa and tracheal mites (Acarapis woodi) results in faster colony collapse than infestation with Varroa alone104. Colony collapse disorder is more often associated with multiple parasites than with single parasites27,105, and a study that inoculated bees with a mixture of four viruses showed elevated bee mortality24.",

Studies in Hawaii and New Zealand have demonstrated a link between Varroa invasion, increasing titres of viruses including deformed wing virus and Kashmir bee virus, and subsequent colony collapses3,107. Indeed, phylogenetic analyses of deformed wing virus indicate that the spread of Varroa around the world, caused by international bee trade, is responsible for the ongoing global epidemic of this virus108. Varroa is not only a vector of this virus, but enhances its infection and growth in bees by suppressing bee immunity109. Statistical analyses indicate that colony collapses in colonies infected with Varroa and deformed wing virus are not entirely due to viral infections, but also due to the damage done by the growth of Varroa itself 25, thus further demonstrating the synergistic negative effects of co-infection with these parasites26.",

For example, transmission opportunities are generally greater for parasites that are transmitted horizontally (between unrelated individuals) than for parasites transmitted vertically (from parent to offspring). As a result, horizontally transmitted parasites are expected to evolve higher virulence117,133,134. In addition, many hosts are co-infected with multiple strains of the same parasite species, and competition between these strains is expected to select for greater parasite virulence93,122,135. Increased horizontal transmission and within-host parasite competition are probably contributing to virulence evolution in honeybees, especially in managed systems. In modern beekeeping, the practice of replacing diseased with new susceptible colonies is also likely to have a major impact on the evolution of virulence. In this case, higher virulence increases the chance of the \u2018birth\u2019 of a new susceptible colony, in contrast to natural systems. This is clearly of benefit to the parasite, reducing the transmission cost of virulence and likely selecting for higher virulence. To determine how beekeeping results in virulence evolution by creating such novel demographics requires explicit theoretical models.",

Strains of the chalkbrood fungus Ascosphaera apis varied in larval mortality rates136, strains of deformed wing virus caused different mortality in adult bees137, and several studies are consistent with genetic variation in Varroa mite virulence138\u2013141. No robust studies have been carried out on virulence evolution, but basic theoretical assumptions are likely to be met. For example, bee colonies with higher numbers of Varroa mites are more likely to collapse25,26,28,29,53,142, probably as a result of direct damage inflicted by haemolymph-feeding mites and viruses vectored by the mite25,28,143. Higher Varroa loads in colonies increase the transmission of mites to other colonies through natural processes such as drifting (bees enter the wrong hive by accident), robbing (bees enter other colonies to steal food), and beekeeping practices such as movement of brood frames between hives144. Thus, the honeybee\u2013Varroa system meets the theoretical assumption that greater mite exploitation of a bee colony results in both greater virulence and between-colony transmission.",

Theoretical models show that when transmission occurs across long distances, parasites tend to evolve higher virulence than when it occurs locally (that is, between near neighbours)145\u2013151. This is due in part to three interacting processes when transmission occurs locally. First, parasite infection results in a shielding effect by which infected individuals are surrounded by other infected or immune individuals who can no longer become infected. Second, highly virulent parasites drive themselves to extinction by killing all hosts in a local spatial cluster. These linked dynamics mean that highly virulent parasites truncate their own transmission via the extinction of nearby susceptible hosts151. Finally, genetic correlations also contribute to the lower virulence of locally transmitting parasites147,151\u2013153: when transmission occurs locally, parasites mostly compete with genetically related parasites for susceptible hosts, which is predicted to result in lower virulence.",

Indirect evidence indicates that these practices have already resulted in more virulent parasites154. As one example, a Norwegian study found that colony losses tended to be higher among migratory than small-scale stationary beekeepers155. Moreover, in a cross-fostering study, Seeley156 inoculated feral bees (with a history of surviving Varroa) and managed bees (with a history of succumbing to Varroa) with mites from managed colonies, and found no differences in bee resistance, thus suggesting that feral colony survival may be due to mite avirulence. This is particularly relevant since feral colonies are characterized by much more local transmission than managed bee colonies (Fig. 3).",

Emerging parasites, such as SARS, HIV and Ebola viruses in humans, are often highly virulent. Such high virulence can arise through at least two processes. First, theoretical studies show that when parasites jump to a novel host species, they encounter a fully susceptible host population, which increases transmission opportunities and thereby selects for increased virulence127,171\u2013174. Such increased transmission opportunities probably underlie the observed increases of virulence of Mycoplasma gallisepticum, which has recently emerged in house finch populations in North America175. Second, natural host-parasite interactions result in coevolutionary dynamics whereby hosts evolve tolerance or resistance as parasites evolve virulence165,176,177. Such highly evolved parasites may express much greater levels of virulence when they infect a novel host species without such resistance or tolerance mechanisms.",

This is partly because Varroa only infests drone (male) brood in A. cerana138,178\u2013180, and A. cerana possesses behavioural defences to resist the mite, including removal of infected brood and social grooming. In A. mellifera colonies, Varroa is not limited to male brood, and its exploitation of worker brood (which comprise the vast majority of brood cells in a colony) allows for much greater population growth. In another example, the recent host shift of Nosema ceranae to A. mellifera has resulted in virulence in its new host; however, another microsporidian, Nosema apis, known to have infected A. mellifera for more than a hundred years, is much less virulent181, which supports the idea of attenuated virulence in the more coevolved relationships.",

This process is supported by theory127,171\u2013173 and empirical studies173,182. Within a few years after releasing a hypervirulent strain of myxoma virus to control rabbit populations in Australia, the virus evolved lower virulence, which maximized its between-host transmission183. Continued infection dynamics also select for more tolerant and resistant hosts, thereby reducing expressed virulence. This does not mean, however, that honeybee diseases will become less virulent in years to come. Instead, current beekeeping practices artificially sustain high transmission levels and also prevent the evolution of honeybee resistance or tolerance by employing artificial disease control57. Thus, without changes in current beekeeping practices, we should expect continued selection for highly virulent parasites.",

Chief among these are Varroa-sensitive hygiene, the phenotype by which nurse bees detect Varroa-infested brood and remove them from the colony191,192 and auto- or allo-grooming in which workers remove mites off their own or nestmates\u2019 bodies193. A key challenge is that trait-breeding approaches operate in apparent tension with the simultaneous pursuit of within-colony diversity. Classical animal breeding, including in honeybees, is based on reducing overall genotypic diversity (for example, through back-crosses or closed populations) in order to increase incidence of targeted alleles194,195. Maintaining such alleles in managed bees is difficult given large dispersal distances of drones196, queen multiple mating, and high labour demands for maintaining inbred lines, all of which contribute to the relatively low adoption of Varroa-sensitive hygiene and other selected traits among beekeepers197. More work is needed to understand how: (1) genotypic diversity can be tractably maintained or increased by beekeepers operating in different management contexts; and (2) if and how genotypic diversity can be integrated into traditional breeding programs that have successfully identified resistance alleles.",

Second, beekeepers routinely manage colonies to discourage reproductive swarming, but it is now known that swarming temporarily reduces both the adult bee population and available brood, thus negatively impacting tracheal mites199 and Varroa54.

But others\u2014such as providing honeybees access to diverse forage plants\u2014could increase contact between species, thus increasing spillover risk. This may be especially true when forage plant density is low, thus forcing managed and wild bees to share plants more often.

A key issue is replication, and for most applied disease studies, the unit of an independent sample is apiary\u2014not colony\u2014as apiary-level effects are well described in the beekeeping literature206. Managing apiaries that are separated in space, with sufficient numbers for adequate sample size, is expensive and represents a logistical challenge. Because of these challenges, most previous work in this realm has unfortunately not been replicated at the apiary level. Second, in most temperate climates honeybees have a distinct annual cycle that contributes variation to key colony parameters such as adult population size, brood production, and foraging. Studies focused on disease ecology and evolution must work within that annual cycle: if experimental manipulations fail once, they cannot be repeated until the following year. Third, honeybee colonies display variation even in closely related colonies within the same apiary, in terms of size, brood production, queen mating number, and temperament. Many of these parameters have direct bearing on responses to disease threats. Thus, it is critical that disease studies standardize both honeybee colonies and parasites as much as possible. For example, studies can start with replicated apiaries with nucleus colonies with the same hive body design and equivalent numbers of workers and new queens that are genetically related. Fourth, disease studies should inoculate colonies with carefully measured, identical infectious doses. As with apiary-level replication, most disease studies in honeybees do not meet these criteria. Given the need for such studies, we suggest that funding agencies recognize these unique and challenging design needs and consider increasing funding limits for honeybee disease research proposals.",
