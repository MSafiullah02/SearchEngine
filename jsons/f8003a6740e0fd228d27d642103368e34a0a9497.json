Good science, however, takes time and careful consideration to prove the value of advancements in diagnosis and treatment. We would like to share what we believe is a classic arc of events for a new imaging indication in the radiology literature: A rush to publish positive results leads to their overinterpretation and, consequently, the dissemination of premature conclusions with broad implications. Although this has occurred before with imaging, our recent experience is unique in that the implications are far-reaching and potentially of immediate importance.",

Fang and colleagues reported CT findings of pneumonia in 50 of 51 patients with RT-PCR-proven COVID-19 (1). Ai and colleagues then reported CT findings of pneumonia in 580 of 601 patients with RT-PCR-proven COVID-19 (2) . Together, these publications ostensibly present a compelling story for CT, with sensitivities for the diagnosis of COVID-19 reported as 98% and 97%, respectively. Ai and colleagues concluded that chest CT may be used as a primary tool for detecting COVID-19 in epidemic areas.",

In reviewing these 2 publications in detail, as well as others that support the use of CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19, we have found that many problems, such as faulty research design, incomplete methods sections with little description of likely biased patient cohorts, absence of a valid gold standard, multiple confounding variables, and scant discussion, limit the generalizability of the results and call into question the broad conclusions that are made. The findings of COVID-19 pneumonia that were used (for example, consolidation and ground-glass opacity) are not specific to the disease; rather, they are commonly seen in a range of infectious and noninfectious conditions. Consequently, positive CT results are only believable if the pretest probability of COVID-19 is high.",

Using 219 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia from China and 205 proven viral pneumonias (not COVID-19) from the United States, the authors asked blinded readers to score the cases as COVID-19 or not. They reported reasonable sensitivities and high specificities for both Chinese and U.S. radiologists and concluded that \"Radiologists in China and the United States distinguished COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT with high specificity but moderate sensitivity.\" On careful review, we found many methodological flaws (5) . Clear differences between the Chinese and U.S. cohorts, which could be obvious by imaging and potentially guide a blinded reviewer, are present, including differences in age (45 vs. 65 years), prevalence of cardiovascular disease (12% vs. 60%), and possibly disease severity. In addition, important and common diseases with imaging appearances that overlap with COVID-19 pneumonia were not included. Moreover, the radiologist's gestalt, and not specific imaging findings, was used to \"diagnose\" COVID-19 pneumonia.",

One of the repercussions of using CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19, which is not discussed in the radiology literature, is that safely performing imaging is problematic. At the very least, droplet precautions with appropriate protective gear (now in short supply) need to be followed, CT scan rooms must be thoroughly cleaned, and the air needs to be recirculated given that COVID-19 is an airborne disease. Even if all protocols are followed, there is a risk that COVID-19 infection may be passed to other patients or staff in imaging departments. ",
