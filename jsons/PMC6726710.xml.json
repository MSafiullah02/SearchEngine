Fever that develops during cytotoxic cancer therapy-induced neutropenia, or \u201cfebrile neutropenia\u201d (FN), is a medical emergency. FN may be an early and only indication of a serious infection, since profoundly neutropenic patients are unable to mount a robust inflammatory response, and signs and symptoms of inflammation are typically attenuated or absent. In these patients, infections may rapidly progress into life-threatening complications (e.g., systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), (severe) sepsis, and septic shock). It is critical to early recognize FN (oral temperature > 38.5 \u00b0C or two consecutive readings of > 38.0 \u00b0C for 2 h and an absolute neutrophil count < 500 \u03bc/L or expected to fall below this threshold), and depending on the estimated risk to develop life-threatening complications, initiate empiric systemic broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy and other supportive care measures promptly [2]. Moreover, FN is associated with higher morbidity, unplanned or prolonged hospitalization, potential intensive care admission, and can necessitate chemotherapy (CT) dose reductions and/or treatment delays, which may lead to poorer clinical outcome and survival [2, 3].",

Nevertheless, patients must be carefully evaluated for potential infection. These patients are routinely subjected to careful history taking, physical examination, chest X-ray, and microbiological evaluations. However, infections can be documented clinically in only 20\u201330% of febrile episodes, whereas a causative microbial pathogen cannot be identified in the majority (> 70%) of cases [5\u201310], and the cause of the fever may remain unidentified (fever of unknown origin; FUO).",

            "text": "Neutropenia risk depends on patient-, tumor-, and treatment-related factors. Although CT dose intensity and myelotoxicity represent significant risk factors, neutropenia and its complications may occur after treatment with almost any type of CT [11]. However, not all neutropenic patients develop fever, and not all episodes of FN progress into life-threatening sepsis. CT regimens can be classified as high, intermediate, and low risk for FN [12]. Those with > 20% FN risk are considered high risk. This includes, but is not limited to, patients treated with high-dose CT with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Most CT regimens used for the treatment of adult solid tumors and lymphoma are rated as intermediate (between 10 and 20%) risk for FN, whereas low-risk cytotoxic regimens are typically considered to be associated with FN risk < 10% [13, 14]. Tools aimed to identify patients with FN at low risk of serious complications have been developed [15]. However, identification of high-risk patients remains a challenge [16]. It is well recognized that oral mucositis (OM) as well as gastro-intestinal mucositis may cause fever [17, 18] and predisposes to systemic translocation of microorganisms [19, 20]. If a patient presents with FN, the physician routinely performs an oral inspection to assess whether ulcerative OM or mucosal infections are present. However, fever may be also caused by inflammation and infection at other oral sites, including the periodontium, the dentition, and salivary glands. Most frequently, this involves asymptomatic chronic infections that were present before the initiation of CT. These infections may exacerbate and present with redness, swelling, and pain [21], but they may also be asymptomatic or manifest with only minimal signs of inflammation. Nevertheless, these predominantly asymptomatic infections (particularly those of the periodontium) may contribute to systemic inflammation [22] and risk of bacteremia and are associated with FN [23\u201325]. Unfortunately, these infections likely remain undiagnosed by simple oral inspection [26]. In order to ascertain diagnosis and management of these \u201chidden\u201d oral infections, the National Institute of Health [27] stated that all patients should receive a comprehensive oral examination by a dental professional and potential foci of infection should be eliminated prior to the start of CT. In most centers, however, this is may be only routinely performed in patients considered at high risk for complications: i.e., patients scheduled for HSCT and those undergoing (chemo)radiation therapy to the head and neck, whereas patients treated with other myelosuppressive CT regimens are not typically referred for pre-treatment oral evaluation. It is thus conceivable that particularly in these patients, FN may have originated from an oral source that remained undiagnosed.",

These include the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis resulting in fever, and effects on the liver resulting in the generation of acute phase proteins. All of which can ultimately result in SIRS and sepsis. Indeed, Blijlevens and colleagues reported that mucositis induces a systemic inflammatory response characterized by fever in neutropenic HSCT recipients, even in the absence of bacteremia [17, 18].",

As dental plaque migrates in apical direction, periodontal attachment degrades, leading to ulcerative periodontal pockets, bone resorption, and tooth loss. About 40\u201350% of adults has chronic gingivitis, around 35% suffer from moderate periodontitis, whereas the prevalence of severe periodontitis is estimated to range from 10 to 15% in Western populations [26]. Periodontitis risk increases with age (peaks between 50 and 60 years) and is more prevalent in men than in women. The severity of the periodontal disease depends on environmental and host factors (e.g., genetic susceptibility, comorbidities, oral hygiene, and smoking) [89]. Inflamed and infected periodontal tissues can expose up to 35\u201350 cm2 of connective inflamed tissue and may serve as a reservoir of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and proteolytic enzymes that may spread systemically via ulcerated pocket epithelium and contribute to endothelial dysfunction, a pro-coagulant state, and low-level inflammation [90, 91]. Periodontal infection has been associated with bacteremic seeding of heart valves and prosthetic devices [92], FUO, and a wide range of systemic conditions, including ischemic cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and respiratory diseases, including aspiration pneumonia [93\u201395].",

Inflammation, particularly an imbalance between upregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine pathways and suppressed anti-inflammatory cytokines, may be a major common driver of these complications [120]. In addition, macrophages have been identified to play a critical role in the potential bidirectional links between periodontal and systemic inflammatory diseases [121]. It has been proposed that the presence of inflammation (anywhere in the body) primes for a dysregulated and exaggerated inflammatory response following a subsequent inflammatory stimulus [122]. This \u201ctwo-hit model\u201d has been hypothesized to underpin a potential association between periodontitis and OM [123]. Moreover, it has been suggested that patients with periodontitis are more prone to developing fever and septic shock syndrome, since endotoxins derived from periodontal pockets may lead to precipitating conditions [124]. These intriguing findings and hypotheses deserve further exploration.",

            "text": "An important clinical question concerns the management of potential oral foci of FN. There is a consensus that patients planned to be treated with high-dose CT with or without HSCT, or those who will be treated with curative (chemo)radiation for head and neck cancers should be referred to a dental professional for a comprehensive oral and periodontal pre-treatment evaluation with appropriate treatment. In patients with head and neck cancers, rigorous elimination of potential foci of infection (i.e., in most cases by extraction) is mandatory in patients with at-risk conditions in the radiation volume [125], whereas in other patient categories, protocols may be less rigid. There is substantial evidence suggesting that intensive oral care performed before and during cancer treatment results in a reduction of infectious complications [24, 53, 66, 68, 126\u2013128]. Elad and coworkers [129] developed a predictive model suggesting that no dental treatment increased the probability of dying due to a dental/periodontal infection in HSCT recipients. In selected cases, treatment of periodontal infections by debridement and reducing the oral bacterial load, and endodontic treatments may be preferred over extractions. In addition, approaches aimed at resolving periodontal inflammation hold significant promise [130]. These interventions may also positively affect OM. When FN (likely) originating from the oral cavity develops during CT treatment, antimicrobial therapy should be preferably based on microbiological evaluation of swabs and/or oral rinsing samples.",

Nevertheless, large longitudinal studies are needed to obtain more insight in the relative contribution of oral pathologies to FN and infectious complications. Particularly, in patients treated with myelosuppressive CT for solid tumors information is scarce. In addition, more information is needed on the impact of myelosuppressive CT and other medications (i.e., antibiotics) on the oral microbiome and systemic translocation of oral microorganisms. Lastly, studies should be directed to obtain a better insight in individual risk factors of patients and to develop optimal personalized oral care strategies.",
