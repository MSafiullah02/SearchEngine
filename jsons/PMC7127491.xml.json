Chemical shifts of phenyl protons are between 7.1 and 7.53 ppm, while phthalimido protons are between 7.8 and 7.9 ppm. H6 chemical shifts were found in the range from 7.82 to 8.47 ppm and H3 protons in the range from 11.33 to 11.73 ppm. The configuration along C2\u2032C3\u2032 double bond was evaluated through 3JH2\u2032H3\u2032 coupling constants (Table 1). The values of all coupling constants involved in the six spin system of N1-substituent including 3JH2\u2032H3\u2032 had to be determined through simulation due to small \u0394\u03b4/J ratios. As an example of our simulations, multiplets of H2\u2032 and H3\u2032 in 14 are compared to the experimental spectrum in Figure 3\n. Vinyl 4JH1\u2032H3\u2032 and 4JH2\u2032H4\u2032 couplings were below signal half width (<1 Hz). Smaller 3JH2\u2032H3\u2032 coupling constants of 10.6, 10.6 and 11.1 Hz in 2, 3 and 7, respectively, are in accordance with Z-isomers along C2\u2032C3\u2032 double bonds. On the other hand, larger 3JH2\u2032H3\u2032 coupling constants of 15.7, 15.5 and 15.7 Hz in 8, 12 and 14, respectively, are in conformity with E-isomers.",

As reported previously,24 the panel cell lines were inoculated onto a series of standard 96-well microtiter plates on day 0 at 1 \u00d7 104 to 3 \u00d7 104 cells/mL, depending on the doubling times of specific cell line. Test agents were then added in five, 10-fold dilutions (10\u22128 to 10\u22124\n M) and incubated for further 72 h. Working dilutions were freshly prepared on the day of testing. The compounds were prepared as 0.04 M solutions in DMSO, and the solvent was also tested for eventual inhibitory activity by adjusting its concentration to be the same as in the working concentrations. After 72 h of incubation the cell growth rate was evaluated by performing the MTT assay (Sigma) which detects dehydrogenase activity in viable cells. The MTT Cell Proliferation Assay is a colorimetric assay system, which measures the reduction of a tetrazolium component (MTT) into an insoluble formazan product by the mitochondria of viable cells. For this purpose, the substance-treated medium was discarded and MTT was added to each well at a concentration of 20 \u03bcg/40 \u03bcL. After 4 h of incubation the precipitates were dissolved in 160 \u03bcL of DMSO. The absorbance (OD, optical density) was measured on a microplate reader at 570 nm. The absorbancy is directly proportional to the cell viability. The percentage of growth (PG) of the cell lines was calculated according to one or the other of the following two expressions:",
