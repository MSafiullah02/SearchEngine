Abrasion or scratching, attack by bacteria or fungi, and the influence of UV or temperature impair the preservation of properties induced during the processing of textiles.

Besides conventional coating methodologies, increasing focus is put on smart coatings to comply with these demands.",

In this case the damaged coating is able to repair itself by means of an increase in mobility.

The restored scratch gains strength because of restored bonds (chemically/physically) (Garc\u00eda et al., 2011, Ghosh, 2009). This technology is already in use in the aerospace and automotive industry. Self-repairing car paints have been developed in which heat triggers the repair action.",

            "text": "Metals such as silver, titanium, zinc and copper are used in finishes and coatings and during fibre extrusion. Although silver is relatively more effective against bacteria compared with copper, which is more effective towards fungi, in both cases the metal ion needs to be released from the metal core to exert its activity. The metal ion will form complexes with vital compounds of the microorganism such as the cell membrane, enzymes and DNA. As a result, the microorganism's metabolism fails in several crucial areas (Lemire et al., 2013). Therefore, resistance against these ions is unlikely to develop because the microorganism is under attack at several targets at the same time. However, as to all antimicrobial products, also for silver and copper, resistive strains have been identified but only in very specific environments such as wastewater treatment plants and mining (Silver, 2003). The active metal ions can be released by dissolving directly from the metal, or by ion exchange. The latter is often used in silver-based products in which silver ions are bound to a ceramic matrix (Lorenz et al., 2012). Although the mobile metal ion is the active compound, metal-based antimicrobials are often not considered to be leaching out. In contrast to toxic chemical compounds, silver and copper ions easily form metal complexes with any organic substance in the vicinity. Leaching test methods such as agar diffusion tests (EN 20645 and AATCC 147) will therefore show no or only limited leaching from silver-treated fabrics.",

One special form of nitrogen compounds for antimicrobial treatment is the so-called quats or quaternary ammonium salts (Coleman, 2005, Shahidi and Wiener, 2012, Windler et al., 2013). These molecules have a positive charge, attracting the negatively charged cell membrane of microorganisms. Mostly, the positively charged nitrogen head is followed by a long organic chain. This combination allows the molecule to puncture the cell membrane, consequently destroying the microorganisms (Curtis White et al., 2010). The advantage of the quats' molecules is their odour-free nature and the ability to add functional groups to the organic chain, which allows them to form a chemical bond to the textile fibres. In this way, leaching is limited and durability increases compared with the smaller nitrogen compounds mentioned previously.",

Often, these products originate from food processing, and researchers try to transfer these products in useful additives for textiles. Bio-based products are mostly plant extracts such as menthol, carvacrol (Oregano sp.), thymol (Thymus sp.), eucalyptol (Eucalyptus sp.), neem extract (Azadirachta indica), aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis), prickly chaff flower (Achysanthus aspera), eugenol (Syzygium aromaticum), turmeric and cumin, to name a few (Joshi et al., 2010, De Smet et al., 2015b). The antimicrobial activity of plant extracts such as peppermint, primrose and perilla oil has been explored as well. In addition, animal extracts also has potential as antimicrobial additives, such as sericin, a macromolecular protein derived from the silkworm Bombyx mori (Joshi et al., 2009, Shahidi and Wiener, 2012).",

Clearly textiles are also prone to fouling, and this chapter will focus on biofouling or biofilm formation and how it can be tackled. Fouling is a result of the stagnating flow of fluids at the surface from which debris will deposit, attracted by van der Waals forces. This process occurs within minutes after submersion. In case of biofilm formation, the first molecules depositing on the surface are proteins and polysaccharides. On the one hand, these molecules cover up any surface functionality and provide a suitable ground for bacteria to attach and develop on this new extracellular matrix (ECM). Bacteria possess surface-bound adhesion proteins designed to bind to such ECM, thus mediating colonisation of the surface. Once the bacteria and other microorganisms have gathered, exertion of more and more proteins and polysaccharides form the so-called external polysaccharide matrix in which the microorganisms thrive and form a complex ecosystem (Bixler and Bhushan, 2012, Harder and Yee, 2009). Some microorganisms and even macroorganisms are expert in colonising virgin surfaces by excreting specially designed attachment proteins such as adhesins (well known in various infectious bacteria) and mussel adhesion proteins (Mytilus edulis) (Klemm and Schembri, 2000, Qin and Buehler, 2014).",

Usually, water- and oil-repellent fluorine-based coatings are used to reduce surface free energy as much as possible. As a result, both the static layer of fluids near the surface and the van der Waals forces are reduced (Van Zoelen et al., 2014). However, microorganisms still manage to colonise these surfaces by secreting viscous, slime-like substances that cover the entire surface and thus cover the underneath functionalities. In contrast to creating hydrophobic and oleophobic surfaces, positive results have been obtained by creating extremely hydrophilic surfaces. The reasoning behind this is that fouling (organic) molecules are partially composed of long-chain hydrocarbon segments that are strongly repelled by the superhydrophilic surface properties (Patel et al., 2010).",

Electronic sensors are well known for their accuracy and ease of data acquisition, but for fabrics, connecting the monitor to the sensor fabric remains an issue of intense research (Chapman, 2012). Alternative to electronics, thermochromic pigments also respond to variations in temperature. Apart from liquid crystals, the temperature resolution of these materials is limited (Seeboth and L\u00f6tzsch, 2013). However, integrated in a coating, the spatial resolution is considerably higher than the point-wise electronic sensors. In addition, a quick visual inspection will indicate hot spots in real time. Although such thermochromic coatings may not be suitable for larger structures, they can be advantageous for quality control during welding of the seams where high enough temperatures have to be reached to ensure proper connection of the fabric parts (Fig. 4.11\n).",

By incorporating specific additives into the PU coating, resistance to abrasion could be even further increased.

As a result, there is no general rule of thumb to assess the safety of a used belt with respect to UV ageing. To counteract this concern, a coating has been developed using a mixture of UV stabilisers to be printed on the belt. In case of UV damage, the print will discolour and indicate the level of UV damage endured by the belt so far. If the safety limit has been exceeded, a text urging the user to replace the belt becomes visible. Fig. 4.13\nexemplifies such label printed on a 35-mm flat web lashing. At UV exposures above 1000 h (EN14836, QUV accelerated ageing test), the replace text is clearly visible and indicates that the belt has endured too much UV irradiation to be used safely.",
