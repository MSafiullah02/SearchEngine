Nosocomial disease often lengthens the hospital stay and, in some instances, may be severe or even fatal> ~ For certain viruses, particularly respiratory syncytial virus, there is a high frequency of infection in nursing, medical, and other stafP ..... which probably also contributes to secondary spread to other infants. Children with respiratory disease are usually placed in isolation and hospital personnel may be cohorted or required to wear gowns when administering patient care. The efficacy of this approach in the control of RSV therefore designed a prospective study to examine the effect of various control methods on the acquisition of symptomatic respiratory infections by medical personnel caring for infants with respiratory disease. The study took place in February and March of 1979, when RSV infections were widespread and influenza A/USSR virus was also present in the community.",

Another possible mode of spread demonstrated in that study was by means of large infected droplets. Rhinoviruses, which might have been present but would not have been detected in this study, have been clearly shown to spread more efficiently by hand-to-nose or hand-to-eye contact than by aerosols. 1~ Influenza, on the other hand, is thought to spread through droplet nuclei, against which masks might be an inefficient barrier.

We recommend that, whenever possible, older, more experienced staff should care for children at high risk of severe respiratory viral illness, and that gown and mask should not be used in an attempt to prevent personnel illness in wards with a high density of acute respiratory infections.
