To explore the role(s) of IFN-g signaling in astrocytes, transgenic mice (GFAP/ IFN-gR1DIC) expressing a dominant-negative IFN-g receptor alpha chain under control of the astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) promoter were generated. Transgenic mice developed normally, had normal astrocyte numbers and distribution, and exhibited no clinically overt phenotype. Transgene mRNA expression was detected only in the CNS, and the transgene-encoded IFN-g receptor 1 colocalized with GFAP, which is consistent with astrocyte expression. Astrocytes from transgenic mice exhibited reduced IFN-g-induced signaling as measured by major histocompatibility class II induction. Neither CNS inflammation nor perforin-mediated clearance of a neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus from astrocytes was impaired following infection. Transgenic mice with impaired astrocyte responsiveness to IFN-g provide a model for studying the selective astrocyte-dependent effects of this critical cytokine in CNS immunopathology.

IFN-g is produced by predominantly T cells and NK cells (Schroder et al., 2004) ; however, it has also been suggested that antigen-presenting cells can secrete IFN-g (Frucht et al., 2001) . IFN-g represents a critical component of immunological defense within the central nervous system (CNS; Benveniste, 1998; Chesler and Reiss, 2002) . IFN-g-secreting cells are normally absent from the resting CNS; however, during inflammation, IFN-g-secreting cells are rapidly recruited into the CNS and exert their immunological function locally (Hart and Fabry, 1995; Popko et al., 1997) . In addition to its critical role in both peripheral and CNS infections, IFN-g plays an important regulatory role in the pathogenesis of the human autoimmune demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) and its murine model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Elevated IFN-g levels correlate with disease severity in both MS and EAE (Olsson, 1992; Popko et al., 1997; Benveniste, 1998) . IFN-g secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells increases prior to MS clinical relapses, and treatment of MS patients with IFN-g had deleterious effects (Panitch et al., 1987; Dettke et al., 1997) .",

In addition to metabolic and trophic functions, they play a crucial role in the maintenance of blood-brain barrier integrity (Rubin and Staddon, 1999) . Astrocytes are also a central component of the CNS response to injury and disease (Eng and Ghirnikar, 1994; Minagar et al., 2002) . Astrocytic reactivity has been described in Alzheimer's disease, in Parkinson's disease (Minagar et al., 2002; Teismann and Schulz, 2004) , and following traumatic injury and ischemia/hypoxia (Eng and Ghirnikar, 1994; Stoll et al., 1998) . Astrocytes are also involved in viral and parasitic infections of the CNS and are believed to play important roles in demyelinating disease (Minagar et al., 2002; De Keyser et al., 2003; Wilson and Hunter, 2004) . Astrocytes express several immune functions potentially associated with CNS immunopathology, including the ability to serve as antigen-presenting cells with IFN-g-inducible surface expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules as well as secretion of a variety of immune mediators, including both chemokines and cytokines (Benveniste, 1998; Dong and Benveniste, 2001) .",

Infiltration of T lymphocytes is associated with clearance of infectious virus, with both CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cells contributing to the reduction in virus replication (Williamson and Stohlman, 1990) . CD8 \u00fe T cells; however, are the major effectors of virus control, utilizing a perforin-dependent mechanism to limit replication in astrocytes, macrophages, and microglia (Lin et al., 1997; Bergmann et al., 2004) . Similarly to its critical role(s) in the control of other CNS viral infections (Weidinger et al., 2001; Chesler and Reiss, 2002) , IFNg plays a protective role within the CNS during JHMV infection (Zhang et al., 1997; Parra et al., 1999) , specifically by limiting virus replication in oligodendroglia. In addition to being targets of JHMV replication, astrocytes are a major source for immune mediators during JHMV infection (Sun et al., 1995; Lane et al., 1998) , and it has been suggested that MHV neurovirulence correlates with the astrocyte proinflammatory response (Li et al., 2004) .",

The truncated receptor, designated IFN-gR1DIC (Dighe et al., 1995) , has only three amino acids of the intracellular domain while retaining the IFN-gR1 extracellular and transmembrane domains, abrogating intracellular signaling. The extracellular domain retains ligand binding activity and contains a human c-myc tag. The IFN-gR1DIC transgene was initially excised from plasmid pSFFV.myc-mgRDIC. A 1-kb EcoR I fragment was first subcloned into pBluescript SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and a BamH I/Hind III fragment subsequently cloned into pRSGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A BamH I/Bgl II fragment was finally subcloned into the gfa2-lacZ plasmid (Brenner et al., 1994) , containing the gfa2 promoter (Fig. 1) . The BamH I/Bgl II-flanked IFN-gR1DIC fragment places the transgene coding region between the gfa2 promoter and a region comprising bp \u00fe95 to \u00fe625 from the mouse protamine-1 (mp1) structural gene, which provides an intron and 3 0 -untranslated and poly-A sequences (Fig. 1 ). An approximately 3.7-kb Bgl II fragment containing the promoter, transgene, and 3 0 regulatory regions was purified from plasmid pGfa2/IFN-gR1DIC, injected into the pronuclei of B6 3 CBA F1 fertilized oocytes, which were transferred into pseudopregnant B6 3 CBA F1 mice.",

CNS and peripheral organs of control wt mice were negative for transgene mRNA (data not shown). Although both lines exhibited identical patterns of transgene mRNA expression, based on the increased level of CNS transgene mRNA detected in mice derived from founder 3 (approximately fourfold higher), further experiments focused on mice derived from the high-mRNA-expressing founder-derived line. At the sixth back-cross, heterozygous transgene-positive mice were intercrossed to produce homozygous mice. No phenotype was apparent during generation of the heterozygotic or homozygotic tg mice, which developed and bred normally. To ensure that transgene expression had no effect on astrocyte development, morphology, or distribution, astrocytes in homozygous tg and wt mice were compared. No differences in amount, distribution, or morphology of astrocytes were detected in either brain (Fig. 3) or spinal cord (data not shown) in comparing tg and wt mice. These data suggest that expression of the GFAPgR1D transgene mRNA is restricted to the CNS and does not result in any clinically apparent phenotype or adversely affect astrocyte development.",

By contrast, c-myc and GFAP colocalized in the CNS of the tg mice (Fig. 4B) , consistent with increased IFN-gR1 expression by astrocytes.

To demonstrate functional transgene expression, astrocytes in mixed glial cultures derived from tg and wt mice were incubated in the presence or absence of IFNg, and class II expression was analyzed by flow cytometry after 48 hr of induction. Cultures containing 30-40% CD45 \u00fe microglia were examined for IFN-g-induced class II expression to provide an internal control population. No class II expression was detected on untreated CD45astrocytes (Fig. 5A ) or microglia (data not shown) from wt or tg mice. By contrast, IFN-g induced class II expression on both astrocytes and microglia derived from wt mice. MHC class II induction on microglia obtained from the CNS of wt and GFAPgR1D tg mice was similar with respect both to the percentage of microglia expressing class II and to the level of expression based on mean fluorescent intensity (data not shown). IFN-g induction of class II on microglia peaked within the first 36 hr of stimulation and then declined at 48 hr, resulting in expression on approximately 20% of microglial cells at 48 hr postinduction (data not shown). In contrast to induction of class II on >60% of astrocytes derived from wt mice, IFN-g induced class II expression on <20% of astrocytes derived from the GFAPgR1D tg mice (Fig. 5A) . A dose-response analysis showed increased class II expression by astrocytes derived from wt mice with increasing IFN-g (Fig. 5B ). By contrast, even at the highest IFN-g concentration tested, astrocytes derived from GFAPgR1D tg mice exhibited markedly diminished class II up-regulation (Fig. 5B) . These data demonstrate that, whereas IFN-g signaling in microglia is not affected, IFN-g responsiveness is selectively impaired in astrocytes derived from the CNS of the GFAPgR1D tg mice.",

Analysis of IFN-g-deficient mice confirmed the critical role of IFN-g in regulation of a variety of CNS autoimmune or viral infections, and also highlighted its complexity. For example, although EAE is mediated by IFN-g-secreting Th1 CD4 \u00fe T cells, inhibition or absence of IFN-g increases disease severity (Billiau et al., 1988; Willenborg et al., 1996) . Additionally, during CNS infection with both JHMV and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, viral clearance is IFN-g dependent (Parra et al., 1999; Rodriguez et al., 2003; Bergmann et al., 2004 ), yet IFN-g contributes to virusinduced demyelination (Pewe and Perlman, 2002; Rodriguez et al., 1995) . Despite its apparent dual roles as effector and inhibitor in these CNS pathologies, IFNg is clearly critical in controlling virus replication in neurons and oligodendroglia (Parra et al., 1999; Griffin, 2003) . Determining the role of IFN-g signaling in specific cell types in vivo is hampered both by the nearly ubiquitous expression of the IFN-gR and by the number of IFN-g-inducible genes and their downstream products (Benveniste, 1998; Chesler and Reiss, 2002; Schroder et al., 2004) , which can be differently regulated in adjacent cells as well as the target cell of interest.",

Activated astrocytes secrete a variety of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, TNF-a, and CXCL10 (Aschner, 1998; Benveniste, 1998; Lane et al., 1998; Dong and Benveniste, 2001) , elevated during brain injury, CNS inflammation and degenerative diseases. However, astrocytes also secrete immune mediators with potential antiinflammatory effects, which inhibit microglial activation, phagocytosis, and cytokine secretion (Aloisi et al., 1997; DeWitt et al., 1998) . Astrocytes also suppress antigen-specific T cell proliferation via induction of the inhibitory CTLA-4 molecule and regulatory T cells (Gimsa et al., 2004; Trajkovic et al., 2004) . Thus, depending on context, these data suggest that IFN-g signaling in astrocytes may result in either pro-or antiinflammatory outcomes.",

Expression of foreign proteins under control of the GFAP promoter can induce astrocyte impairment structurally and functionally and thus adversely impact the CNS. For example, inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration have all been observed after astrocyte-specific transgenic expression of inflammatory cytokines (Campbell, 1998) . Increased secretion of TGF-b by astrocytes resulted in hydrocephalus, whereas expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-6 reduced brain and body weight and decreased the number of astrocytes (Galbreath et al., 1995; Bienvenu et al., 2004) . Expression of human GFAP caused severe encephalopathy associated with altered astrocyte morphology, including the presence of inclusion bodies (Messing et al., 1998) . Thus, although a variety of abnormalities is associated with expression of some transgenes in astrocytes, the GFAPgR1D tg mice developed and bred normally and did not exhibit clinical symptoms or abnormalities in astrocyte frequency, distribution, or morphology. Transgene-specific expression by astrocytes was confirmed by immunofluorescence. Although only minimal IFN-gR1 expression was detected in wt mice, IFN-gR1 expression by astrocytes was more readily detected in tg mice. However, expression of the accessory IFN-gR2 remained low on both wt and tg astrocytes, with no simultaneous increase in IFN-gR1DIC/ IFN-gR1 and IFN-gR2 surface expression as previously noted in mice with targeted expression of the IFN-gR1 transgene in oligodendroglia (Gonzalez et al., 2005) . These data are consistent with the concept that IFN-gR1 and IFN-gR2 are not preassembled (Bach et al., 1996) . Although no increase in IFN-gR2 was detected, the diminished response to IFN-g provides evidence for a functional transgene with impaired IFN-g signaling. The response to IFN-g was substantially reduced in astrocytes derived from the tg mice; however, the response was not completely abolished. Although this suggests that astrocytic responses in these tg mice may be diminished but not completely eliminated, increased transgene expression from the GFAP promoter, for example, during inflammation (Eng and Ghirnikar, 1994) , may increase differential responsiveness.",

            "text": "Mice with global defects in IFN-g signaling exhibit impaired immune responses (Dalton et al., 1993; Huang et al., 1993) . By contrast, impaired IFN-g signaling exclusively in astrocytes did not affect peripheral immune responses or the activation or CNS recruitment of inflammatory cells, despite the notion that chemokines secreted by astrocytes influence recruitment of inflammatory cells into the CNS during JHMV infection (Lane et al., 1998) . CXCL10 plays an essential role in the antiviral defense following MHV infection of the CNS (Liu et al., 2000) . However, CXCL10 can also be induced in a variety of cells, including astrocytes, upon stimulation with type I interferons (Liu et al., 2000) . Consistently with the data suggesting that virus replication is controlled in astrocytes via perforin-mediated cytotoxicity and that MHC class I is regulated by both type I interferons and IFN-g (Lin et al., 1997; Parra et al., 1999; Bergmann et al., 2004) , no difference in virus replication or cell types infected was detected in comparing JHMV pathogenesis in GFAPgR1D tg and wt mice. These data are consistent with induction of MHC class I, required for control of JHMV infection by virus-specific CD8 \u00fe T cells, via type I interferon signaling (Atta et al., 1995) , a pathway unimpaired in these tg mice. These data suggest that, in contrast to the IFN-gdependent MHC class II expression on astrocytes and microglia (Fierz et al., 1985; Bergmann et al., 2003) , MHC class I expression, at least at the minimal levels sufficient for CD8 \u00fe T cell recognition, is independent of IFN-g signaling.",
