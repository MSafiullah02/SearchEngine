As well known, the primary objective of vaccination policy is to minimize the social impacts of pandemic by protecting susceptible individuals from possible infection. In this regard, it is important to establish proper vaccination strategy to prevent the diffusion of a contagious disease at the outset. The decision on the scale of vaccination and the required level of vaccine stockpile is a critical issue, particularly when the disease diffusion process is so fast that immediate vaccination would be only the most viable and effective measure to prevent pandemic.",

However, more originally, mathematical models of infectious diseases can be traced back to 1776 when Daniel Bernoulli used a smallpox model to discuss effectiveness of mass vaccination (inoculation). His basic assertion in building mathematical model is well stated in his remark, \u201cI simply wish that, in a matter which so closely concerns the wellbeing of the human race, no decision shall be made without all the knowledge which a little analysis and calculation can provide.\u201d His fundamental question in regards to the smallpox problem rampant in his era is whether the general population needs to be vaccinated against smallpox when there is a fatal risk of such inoculation measures. Afterwards, many pivotal research including Kermack and McKendrick (1927) have contributed to establish a field of mathematical epidemiology and their works are comprehensively summarized in Anderson and May (1982).",

There are a few papers providing economic models coupled with the epidemiological SIS model. Goldman and Lightwood (1996) study the effect of treatment when the disease has a pattern of susceptibility, infection, and recovery under the framework of SIS model. Similar types of SIS model are presented in Gersovitz and Hammer (2004) and Francis (2004) who analyze social planner's problems for preventing the spread of disease and identifying optimal subsidy for flu vaccination. More recently, Anderson et al. (2012) use the standard SIS model to solve an optimization problem for allocating limited budgets in an effort to minimize the discounted social cost of infection. Similar to them, this paper adopts a SIS model since it allows dynamic processes with interactions between the infected and susceptible population.",

In addition, the paper focuses on the decision on the optimal level of vaccine stockpile based on an economic-epidemiological model. More specifically, the vaccine stockpile model is developed from the perspectives of a real option, since, when the vaccination is once carried out for the substantial number of susceptible group, it is largely irreversible, thereby creating option values for the vaccination particularly when the infectious disease follows a stochastic diffusion process. Real option approach enables us to capture the stochastic nature of disease diffusion, irreversible vaccination costs and irreversible damage costs from the disease outbreak in a unified framework (Dixit and Pindyck, 1994). For example, a real option model to optimally manage stochastic pest population are presented in Saphores (2000) who proves the potentiality of biological resource economics models in studying disease control under stochastic environment. Hsu and Schwartz (2008) develop a real option model to study vaccine investment problem to treat the disease and they examine the effects of various types of research incentive contracts on the vaccine investment. In contrast with those papers which do not study epidemiological aspects of disease diffusion, this paper attempts to combine explicitly the study of the disease control and vaccine stockpile.",

In addition to the development of the herd immunity, the presented economic-epidemiological model allows us to introduce other interesting measure, i.e., the vaccination threshold which cannot be derived from the conventional epidemiological approach. The vaccination threshold is the point at which it is optimal to implement the impulsive vaccination while taking into account the vaccination costs and benefits.

The exponential growth of the reported infection cases has raised issues on the scale of impulsive vaccination and the level of vaccine stockpile as a precautionary measure. For this study, the data on the reported incidents of H1N1 infection was obtained from the Korea CDC (Center for Disease Control). Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to diagnose 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infection for the subjects of visiting outpatients. The death number per week was 1 up to 5 at the initial outbreak stage but was rapidly increased up to 20 cases later. According to Kim et al.

From this, \u03b2 is recovered by setting \u03b2\n = \n\u03b1/K. A non-linear least square method is adopted to estimate parameters in Eq.

The contour map illustrated in Fig. 2\nconfirms an existence of minimum value for the least square errors at around \u03b1\n = 0.4 and its corresponding t. Using them as initial values, the estimation of non-linear least square provides \u03b1\n = 0.496 and \u03b2\n = 0.4799. The estimate of volatility parameter is \u03c3\n = 0.0683 that is calculated from the log-normal distribution of residual values of the least squares. The fitted curve of logistic function is depicted in Fig. 1 to be compared with the actual values. The reported mortality rate in Korea is m\n = 0.005 (KCDC, 2010). The recovery rate is assumed to be \u03b3\n = 0.3149 based on R\n0\n = \n\u03b2/(\u03b3\n + \nm) so that it could be consistent with the mid-point of R\n0\n \u2208 [1.2, 2.0] as reported in Suh et al.

For the economic-epidemiologica model, numerical analysis is adopted to identify I\n\u204e which satisfies a(1 \u2212 \nI) + \u03a6\u2032(I)(I\n \u2212 \nI\n2)/\u03a6(I) + \nI\n = 0. Based on the benchmark set of parameter values (\u03b2\n = 0.4799, \u03c3\n = 0.0683, \u03b3\n = 0.3149, w\n = 0.6, m\n = 0.005, \u03c1\n = 0.1), we obtain I\n\u204e\n = 0.0347, indicating that it is optimal to commence an impulsive vaccination when the infected population reaches 3.47%. The value of I\n\u204e is used to calculate the economic-epidemiological HIT, H\n0\n\u204e. The resulting value of H\n0\n\u204e is 0.4179 which is approximately 23% higher than the conventional H\n0. Notably, the economic-epidemiological model calls for more protective measure, approximately 42% of HIT, which is substantially higher than 33% of HIT in conventional epidemiology approach.6\n",

This relative ordering of H\n0\n\u204e and H\n0 may hold in a robust manner, since the assumption of non-conceivably high interest rate is not particularly pertinent when considering adverse long-run effects of social costs of disease. The results presented here warrant cautious interpretations, mainly because some parameter values are speculated due to the limited information on the diffusion of H1N1 in Korea.

Since the vaccination is largely irreversible, and an infectious disease follows a stochastic diffusion process, the decision making on the impulsive vaccination could be analyzed in a real option framework (Dixit and Pindyck, 1994). The differences between the economic-epidemiological model and epidemiological model were examined under the framework of the so-called herd immunity to protect massive susceptible populations from the infectious disease. A numerical illustration of H1N1 in Korea was presented to prove an applicability of the developed economic-epidemiological model. As reflected in an adage, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, the resulting policy rule suggested a more aggressive and precautionary strategy on the scale of vaccination and vaccine stockpile compared to the traditional epidemiological model.",

SIR type of model is particularly relevant when there exist long-lasting immune effects after recovery from the infection or vaccination as in measles and rubella. Another promising approach for further development is to consider network effects associated with the diffusion of a contagious disease among agents (Barrat et al., 2008) which is not unfortunately feasible for the study in this paper due to the data limitation on Korea H1N1.",
