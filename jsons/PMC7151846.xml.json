            "text": "There are a number of cardinal features of acute virus infections which need to be emphasized. The presence of viruses at the site of illness usually means that the virus is associated with that illness and is almost certainly causal. There are exceptions to this, such as enteroviruses in stools and adenoviruses both in stools and the respiratory tract, but even here they have caused infection and, because they have the property of being excreted for a long time, may be found at the site after the acute phase has passed. However, in lesions of the skin, central nervous system and respiratory tract, viruses found in the presence of symptoms should be taken as causal. In the respiratory tract, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and the parainfluenza viruses are seldom if ever found without illness. The rapid diagnosis of a virus infection in 2-3 hours after admission to hospital revolutionizes the attitude of physicians. They are no longer dealing with a disease of unknown aetiology for most, if not all, of the patient's stay in hospital but with one which is a precise entity immediately known.",

However, herpesvirus hominis eye infections are not infrequent and those of the brain, though rare, are often fatal. Both these conditions need immediate diagnosis and treatment with one of the antiherpetic drugs now available. Amongst these drugs with antiherpetic action are idoxuridine, cytarabine, vidarabine and acycloguanosine (Collins and Bauer, 1977). The first has been effective when locally applied but is toxic when administered systemically; cytarabine and vidarabine are less toxic but trial evidence of their effectiveness in herpes encephalitis is still equivocal. Acycloguanosine is reputed to be non-toxic and with a very powerful antiherpetic action; its action is directed against viral enzyme only. It could indicate the lines along which certain antiviral drugs may develop. The results of the clinical trials which are proceeding at the moment must be awaited with reasonable optimism (Schaeffer et al., 1978).",

Therefore, if antiviral therapy is to stand any chance of success a diagnosis must be made as near to the time of onset of symptoms as possible. It is only at this stage that antiviral drugs can do good by preventing the infection of further cells and thus further replication of virus. This delaying process will allow the normal immunological defences of the body to respond fully and thus terminate what might be an overwhelming virus infection. The most vulnerable groups are therefore the young, perhaps the very old and those who are immunosuppressed. Even when efficient antiviral agents become available their use will still be dependent on accurate rapid virus diagnosis in order to start treatment sufficiently early to contain the infection.",

It would appear from various studies that the majority of these are of viral aetiology (Gardner et al., 1967; Aherne et al., 1970; Scott et al., 1978). The viruses most frequently associated with infant deaths are respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, parainfluenza virus type 3 and various adenoviruses, but recently others such as parainfluenza virus type 1, 4a and 4b have also been incriminated. Measles, too, occasionally causes death in the normal child but is a major cause of death in the immunosuppressed child, who is usually undergoing antitumour therapy (see\npage 292). The majority of respiratory viruses are labile and by necessity most autopsies need to be delayed at least 18 hours, often much longer, in order to obtain the consent of relatives. It has already been pointed out that the ability to demonstrate the presence of virus antigen persists for longer than the ability to detect virus infectivity.

Therapy not only includes the above-mentioned drugs but also radiation. Recent months have seen the development of techniques for the grafting of bone marrow transplants after whole-body irradiation. These measures have proved highly successful as regards the primary condition which now can, in many instances, be cured. However, during the treatment the child is center highly vulnerable and susceptible to infection. Infection has therefore become the major cause of death in acute lymphatic leukaemia, the majority of these infections being associated with viruses. The viruses involved are rhinoviruses, measles, mumps, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and the other everyday viruses which normal children easily combat. However, children with leukaemia and under therapy can die of rhinovirus pneumonia, and most children who are infected with measles during the course of their leukaemia also die. In a defined study of virus infections in childhood leukaemias, their importance in morbidity and mortality has been clearly demonstrated (Craft et al., 1977, 1978, 1979). The numbers of patients both in remission and relapse in whom viruses were associated with death are indicated in Table 15\n. A distinct feature of infectious illness in the immunosuppressed child is its unusual symptomology. Measles is especially severe, often fatal, but seldom has a rash; respiratory syncytial virus, less often seen in childhood after 1-2 years of age, causes severe and prolonged symptoms in the older immunosuppressed child. On many occasions, onset of a virus infection can be sudden and severe, with death rapidly intervening. Rapid diagnosis in these circumstances has become a vital procedure; it is a guide both to the amount of immunosuppressive therapy which should be given at this time and to specific antiviral treatment needed.",

Measles is particularly difficult to diagnose in the immunosuppressed child because of its very varied picture. It is possible that early treatment with interferon might alter what has, up till now, been a very gloomy prognosis; the use of rapid diagnosis and interferon therapy in measles is currently being investigated in a multicentred study. However, the key to any successful chemotherapy must lie in early diagnosis, and the screening of secretions for respiratory viruses even in mild infections should include a test for measles. Immunofluorescence enables this to be done. In the normal child with measles, infected cells, including giant cells, are rarely seen after the third day of rash (McQuillin et al., 1976). The picture is totally different in the immunosuppressed child with measles. In these circumstances the secretions are loaded with giant cells which continue to be excreted, usually until the child dies (Pullan et al., 1976). These virus- loaded giant cells are far more numerous and observed for a far longer period than those which occur in the normal child even at the height of his rash. Figure 78\nillustrates the appearance of such a giant cell on the twenty- first day of a measles illness that had become complicated by the development of an interstitial pneumonia. Plate 18 illustrates a giant cell in a lung impression smear of a leukaemic child who died with measles pneumonitis. There is every hope that the immunofluorescent techniques will not only simplify the diagnosis of these cases but be a guide to the effect of interferon in the ongoing coded trials.",

In fact, the latter illnesses were all pneumonias and a number of these patients died. The patients with influenza A infection admitted to hospital are usually older than those admitted with respiratory syncytial virus infection. The usual reason for admission is a febrile convulsion. Frequently by the time they have been admitted to hospital they have recovered from their convulsion and have lost their fever. Being relatively well at this stage, they run around the ward coughing and secreting virus over patients who can ill afford to acquire infections, such as patients with mucoviscidosis, congenital heart disease or leukaemia or on immunosuppressive therapy. It is the latter group of patients who fare badly when acquiring influenza A. Unfortunately, toddlers are not respecters of cubicles, which to them are no barrier. It is essential that ward staff realize that febrile convulsions in 50 per cent of cases can be of viral origin and when influenza A is prevalent the percentage of febrile convulsions due to this cause and admitted to hospital rises to very much higher than average (Stokes et al., 1976). They must also realize the serious consequences of cross-infection in debilitated children. Rapid diagnosis by immunofluorescence has provided a method for identifying influenza A within 3 hours of admission to hospital. Now that the risks of influenza A cross-infections are known, every child with a febrile convulsion admitted to hospital when influenza A is prevalent must be examined and also confined to a cubicle until the result of the rapid diagnostic test is available.

Collection of specimens, their transportation under suitable conditions to the laboratory for virus isolation and the sampling of all illnesses from the most trivial to the most severe in all age groups and both sexes have proved to be the chief stumbling blocks. To obtain some idea of the virus epidemiology of an area, the total admission of patients to the hospital covering that area can be investigated. Hospital admissions, however, can only reflect the viruses present in the community as only the most severely ill patients are admitted, but nevertheless much useful information can be obtained. Many such surveys have been carried out both in Newcastle and in various parts of the country (Report by the Medical Research Council, 1978); the most recent report gave valuable information on the occurrence of epidemics of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B and parainfluenza viruses over a 6-year period, the interrelationships of these viruses and the effect of climatic conditions, and admission rates to hospital (Martin, Gardner and McQuillin, 1978). The use of immunofluorescence for rapid virus diagnosis made possible the investigation of a greater number of patients and the diagnosis of a wider range of viruses than could be achieved by routine methods. The study was based on total hospital admissions and included 2311 identifications by immunofluorescence of respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 and 3 and influenza A alone.",

Virus culture, however, still takes place mainly when the specimen submitted is unsuitable for immunofluorescence, for example when there are too few cells in the secretion or a throat swab has been submitted instead of a secretion. Under these circumstances, an agent causing a suspicious cytopathic effect can be immediately identified6 by immunofluorescence by scraping the cells off the culture tube, placing them on to a slide and staining in the usual way. This identifies the agent immediately without the necessity for a long and unsatisfactory neutralization test such as for respiratory syncytial virus or for a fastidious haemadsorption inhibition test for the identification of a haemadsorption virus.",
