            "text": "Introduction: we investigated an outbreak of influenza-like illness (ILI) at a boarding school in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. We aimed to confirm the etiological agent, estimate attack rates and identify risk factors for illness. Methods: we conducted a retrospective cohort study including senior school boarders (n=308). Students with ILI (cough and fever) were identified through school medical records. We also conducted a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study among senior students including boarders (n=107) and day students (n=45). We collected respiratory specimens for respiratory pathogen testing by real-time polymerase chain reaction from a subset of symptomatic students. We calculated attack rates of medically attended ILI (medILI) and identified factors associated with medILI using logistic regression. We calculated seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) against medILI. Results: influenza A (H3N2) virus was detected in 61% (23/38) of specimens. Attack rate for medILI was 13% among boarders (39/308) in the cohort study and 20% in both day students (9/45) and boarders (21/107) in the cross-sectional study. Playing squash was associated with medILI (aOR 5.35, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.68-17.07). Of the boarders, 19% (57/308) were vaccinated before the outbreak. The adjusted VE against medILI was 18% (aOR 0.82, 95% CI 0.38-1.78). The outbreak led to cancellation of several events and the need for academic remedial sessions. Conclusion: we confirmed an influenza A (H3N2) virus outbreak with a high attack rate. The outbreak affected academic and sports activities. Participation in sports and social gatherings while experiencing ILI should be discouraged to reduce viral transmission and impact on school activities.",

We included all 308 senior school boarding students, but excluded day students as they were more likely to seek private healthcare and we did not have the resources or ethical permission to review records from students at all private practitioners in the town. Cases of medILI from 3 July -1 August 2016 (start of the school term until end of investigation) were defined as boarding students having a cough and fever as noted on records or extrapolated from prescribed medication, and were identified through a retrospective review of medical records and the admission log at the sanatorium. Fever was defined as either a documented body temperature above 38\u00b0C or \"fever\" noted under symptoms in the medical record. Non-cases were persons who did not meet the medILI case definition. Medical records of 198 patients were reviewed from the senior school boarding population, including all cases of clinician-diagnosed influenza from 3-27 July 2016 (n=82), and a convenience sample of a subset of non-cases (n=116). Age, residence information and influenza vaccination status prior to the outbreak for all boarders were obtained from the school's register.",

Symptoms among students presenting to the sanatorium included fever, cough and generalised body pains.

A further 34 respiratory specimens collected (27 nasopharyngeal and 7 throat swabs) from day and boarding students were tested as part of the investigation. Of all the specimens collected (n=38), 23 (61%) tested positive for influenza A (H3N2) viruses. No influenza B viruses or RSV were detected. Results from bacteriological investigations are shown in Figure 3. Due to sample volume constraints, only 33 specimens were tested for N. meningitides. Thirteen of the 38 specimens (34%) were collected from individuals that did not meet the medILI case definition, 9 of which tested positive for influenza A (H3N2) virus. On molecular analysis, South African influenza A (H3N2) virus HA gene sequences from the 2016 influenza season formed at least 5 genetic clusters (with geographic clustering pattern) supported by bootstrap values of 98-100% and belong to the 3C.2a genetic clade (Figure 4). All HA genes from influenza A (H3N2) viruses identified in the school outbreak were in the genetic cluster characterised by the following amino acid mutations when compared to the 2016 vaccine strain: N171K, I406V and G484E. The outbreak strains formed a distinct highly homogeneous monophyletic sub-cluster with 99% bootstrap support characterised by N121K, I140M and G479E substitutions when compared to the vaccine strain. Included in the outbreak sub-cluster was a single H3N2 virus originally identified in an individual from the Western Cape Province collected in week 24 of the 2016 season trough routine surveillance. All outbreak specimens were collected in weeks 28 to 30. This Eastern Cape Province lineage was distinguished from the A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 vaccine strain by a total of 9 amino acid mutations including the aforementioned and following mutations in the deduced HA amino acid sequences (excluding signal peptide): S96N, K160T and P194L. These 9 mutations are characteristic of the recently emerged 3C.2a1 sublineage. All other South African viruses used as reference belong, like the vaccine strain, to clade 3C.2a.",

            "text": "There are several non-influenza viruses that can cause ILI, as well as some bacterial pathogens, although bacterial aetiologies for ILI are rare[15]. The most common pathogens isolated in non-influenza virus ILI include rhinoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, adenoviruses and coronaviruses[16,17], none of which were identified during laboratory testing of the specimens. Although bacterial pathogens were detected in some samples, levels were consistent with colonization of the respiratory tract; therefore, it was difficult to determine causation[18,19].Closed spaces facilitate the spread of influenza viruses since they are transmitted by droplets and aerosols from infected people when coughing or sneezing [20]. A modelling study by Glass et al. among school-aged children predicted that social interactions with friends, attending school lectures, and participating in sports were some of the most important factors for influenza transmission [21]. This may be the cause for the association of medILI with playing squash. The sport takes place in a confined space leading to participants being in circulated during this outbreak may have undergone antigenic drift from the vaccine strain leading to reduced protection, but antigenic data were unavailable. Genome sequencing of the strains did indicate some mutations from the vaccine strain, but these mutations would not necessarily translate to a reduction in vaccine effectiveness. The or use an alcohol-based hand rub regularly; and wipe down regularly touched surfaces with a disinfectant. Lastly, it is important to practice good respiratory etiquette by covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing [32]. Schools should have an outbreak management plan in place to be able to detect when the number of cases exceeds the normal seasonal number for early outbreak detection and have a contingency plan in place if this occurs.as not all cases were laboratory tested. The higher attack rate observed in the cross-sectional study may be due to the use of selfreported symptoms and not physician indicate symptoms as in the cohort study. The impact of the outbreak might not be completely represented when using the medically attended ILI case definition as described by WHO which relies on the presence of a fever and cough[33]. There were several cases of clinically diagnosed influenza identified through medical record review that did not meet our case definition; mostly due to the absence of a cough. A recent transmission study in Hong Kong showed that 41% of individuals who tested positive for influenza did not present with fever, cough or sore throat, which was the WHO case definition for ILI prior to 2014[24].",
