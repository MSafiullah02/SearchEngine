The reprogramming of protein translation observed in stressed cells is usually initiated by the phosphorylation of serine 51 on eIF2\u03b1.11 The stress\u2010activated signaling cascades responsible for this event are centered around a related family of serine/threonine kinases. This family includes: (1) PKR (protein kinase R), a double\u2010stranded RNA\u2010dependent kinase that is activated by viral infection, heat, and UV irradiation12,13; (2) PERK (PKR\u2010like endoplasmic reticulum kinase; also known as PEK, or pancreatic eIF2\u03b1 kinase), a resident endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein that is activated when unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER lumen14,15; (3) GCN2 (general control non\u2010repressible 2), a protein that is activated primarily by amino acid deprivation16; and (4) HRI (heme\u2010regulated inhibitor), a kinase that is activated under conditions of heme deprivation and arsenite\u2010induced oxidative stress.17,18 Stress\u2010induced phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 converts eIF2 from a substrate to a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, depleting the level of the eIF2\u2010GTP\u2010methionyl tRNA required for cap\u2010dependent translation initiation, thereby inhibiting global translation and initiating SG assembly.2\n",

            "text": "During the past decade, significant progress has been made in understanding the role of SGs in maintaining the survival of cells exposed to adverse conditions. SGs help to silence the expression of housekeeping genes and promote the expression of molecular chaperones that repair stress\u2010induced damage.74 At the same time, sequestration of selected proteins within SGs (e.g., RACK1, RSK2) may determine whether stressed cells live and repair stress\u2010induced damage, or die by apoptosis. In this sense, SGs may play a key role in modulating life or death decisions in cells exposed to adverse conditions. The finding that SG assembly and disassembly are regulated by myriad posttranslational modifications of SG components indicates that this process is subject to complex regulation. It is likely that the identification of new types of modifications, additional modified target proteins, and upstream signaling pathways will be essential to fully understand the functions of SGs. Drugs that target these signaling cascades may prove useful in the treatment of infectious diseases and cancer.",
