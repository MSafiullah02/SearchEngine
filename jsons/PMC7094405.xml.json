The most important health concern is calf diarrhea, resulting in the greatest economic loss in this age group (Torsein et al., 2011). Diarrhea is a complex, multifactorial disease with numerous infectious and noninfectious factors. Factors influencing the pathogenesis of diarrhea are pathogen exposure, environmental conditions, management, nutritional state, and immune status.",

(1999), for example, reported that cow cleanliness and cleaning of the barns after the calving season may prevent diarrhea. Similar results were obtained in a prospective cohort study by Frank and Kaneene (1993). Pithua et al. (2009) compared the prevalence of diarrhea and other diseases in calves in regard to cleaning the calving area. In that study, the risk for diarrhea or any other calf disease was not different between groups, indicating that management factors other than the calving pen had a greater influence on calf health. Regarding colostrum supply, few authors could determine statistically significant effects. The origin of colostrum and route of colostrum feeding (nipple or bucket versus suckling) have been associated with the occurrence of diarrhea (Svensson et al., 2003; Lundborg et al., 2005). Furthermore, the concentration of IgG was related to diarrhea (Berge et al., 2009).",

A farm with diarrhea problems was defined as a farm with multiple treatments by the veterinarian for calf diarrhea. Out of these lists, farms were randomly chosen, and farmers were contacted in the week before the planned visit, asked if problems with calf diarrhea were still present on farm, and asked whether they were willing to participate in the study. Farms were only enrolled into the study when at least one calf suffered from diarrhea at the farm visit. Five farms refused to participate and another 7 of the contacted farms had no actual cases of diarrhea. To define cases of diarrhea, feces of preweaned calves was evaluated as described by Larson et al.

Type and placement of individual calf housing showed a high correlation (Spearman correlation r = 0.73). Consequently, only the variable \u201cplacement of individual calf housing\u201d was chosen for the model. After backward stepwise elimination of nonsignificant variables, a minimal model containing only significant variables was obtained. This minimal model consisted of 5 variables: herd size, presence of farm animals other than cattle on farm, cleaning of the calving pen, placement of individual calf housing, and the presence of respiratory tract disease in calves on farm (\nTable 5). A greater herd size, expressed by the number of dairy cows, increased the odds of calf diarrhea on farm [odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.10; P\n = 0.03]. Furthermore, the presence of other farm animals was a risk factor (OR 26.89, 95% CI: 2.64 to 273.5; P\n = 0.01). On farms where the calving area was cleaned after each calving, calves had decreased odds for calf diarrhea compared with farms where calves were born in calving areas only cleaned seldom or several times per year (OR 0.12, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.79; P\n = 0.03). Placement of individual calf housing in a barn (either in a barn only for calves and young stock or in the cows\u2019 barn) versus outdoors decreased the risk of diarrhea (OR 0.02, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.47; P\n = 0.01).

The average number of cows per farm (34 cows in our study) was larger than the overall average in the 2 visited regions, with 18 and 21 cows per farm, respectively, as reported by the Austrian Association of Cattle Breeders (ZAR, 2010). This might be influenced by selection of the farms being based exclusively on the presence of diarrhea. It is likely that very small farms might have been recognized as diarrhea problem farms less often because only a few calves were present during the selection period. This might have biased the outcome and has to be taken into account when interpreting the results. In this study, the presence of diarrhea was significantly associated with herd size. One possible explanation for the association between farm size and diarrhea could be that although farms in Austria have become larger in recent years, additional personnel were not employed on the surveyed farms. Even on farms with up to 115 cows, no employees were present, which could lead to a decrease in the time that the farmer can spend on calf care. Similar results concerning the association between the appearance of diarrhea and the herd size were obtained by Vaarst and S\u00f8rensen (2009) in Denmark. Furthermore, Frank and Kaneene (1993) identified an increased incidence of calf diarrhea for larger herds, explained by greater housing density that could lead to larger disease outbreaks. Kehoe et al. (2007) reported better colostrum management in smaller farms, which could also reduce the prevalence of disease in young calves.",

A calving pen was present more often on case farms in the current study than on control farms (P\n = 0.02). Cleaning of such an area after each calving significantly reduced the odds of calf diarrhea on farm, as shown by the multiple analyses. A consequent cleaning was performed on only 19% of the farms with a calving area. The increased appearance of diarrhea on farms with a calving pen could therefore be explained by a lack of hygiene and the use of this area for diseased animals. This might lead to a high degree of contamination with pathogens and consequently to high infection pressure on the newborn calf. We can conclude that regular hygienic measures in the calving area should be implemented to reduce the risk of calf morbidity, as shown in other studies (Frank and Kaneene, 1993; Bendali et al., 1999).",

According to the statements of the farmers on the visited farms, calves received colostrum within 6 h after birth (as required by legislation; European Community, 2008) on 99% of the farms. On 7 of these farms, calves were allowed to suckle their dam, representing a risk factor associated with failure of passive transfer (Trotz-Williams et al., 2008). None of the factors associated with colostrum supply had a significant effect on the appearance of diarrhea in our study. This is in accordance with other studies (Bendali et al., 1999; Gulliksen et al., 2009) and can be explained by the high similarity between farms and by the fact that the time of feeding first colostrum is regulated by law.

Individual calf housing is commonly advised because it may lead to a decreased pathogen load (Barrington et al., 2002); in epidemiologic studies, group size rather than grouping itself was associated with an increased risk for morbidity and mortality (Svensson et al., 2003; Maunsell and Donovan, 2008). Nevertheless, in individual calf housing, it is possible to feed calves individually according to their special needs and it is easier to control animals and recognize certain abnormalities. Housing of calves outside the barn is thought to reduce the risk of disease (Marc\u00e9 et al., 2010), as indoor housing has disadvantages such as an increased pathogen load and risk for disease transmission. This, however, was not the case on farms in the present study, in which greater odds for diarrhea were found for calves housed in igloos outside the barn compared with individual housing in a barn. This is in accordance with a study performed in the United Kingdom by Johnson et al. (2013). Possible explanations could be the cold environment and exposure of the calves to considerably greater climate changes (Vasseur et al., 2010). This could be true for the 2 areas of Austria visited in the current study because minimum temperatures were \u221214 to \u221219\u00b0C during December and January 2009 and 2010. Maximum temperature differences were registered during April with a difference in mean daily temperatures up to 19\u00b0C (ZAMG, 2009\u20132010). An advantage of indoor housing mentioned often by farmers is easier and better monitoring of the calves.",

The reason for a restricted milk feeding program is that calves are forced to ingest concentrates earlier and at greater amounts, stimulating rumen development (Drackley, 2008). This procedure, however, does not take into account that these effects are of minor importance within the first 3 wk of life and that calves cannot meet their energy requirements by an additional intake of concentrates during this time of life (Jasper and Weary, 2002; Sweeney et al., 2010). In contrast, several studies (reviewed by Khan et al., 2011; Silper et al., 2014) showed that milk fed at amounts greater than 10 to 12% of calf BW had a positive influence on the calf performance, whereas deficiencies in nutrition may lead to depressed immunity in calves and increase morbidity (Nonnecke et al., 2003).",

Whole milk may have advantages over milk replacer in terms of greater energy content and a better balance of nutrients (Davis and Drackley, 1998; Godden et al., 2005). This might therefore improve calf immunity and lead to a decreased disease rate (Godden et al., 2005). Additional advantages of feeding whole milk are that it is easier and less error-prone than feeding milk replacer (e.g., errors related to products with inadequate protein or incorrect mixing ratios) and that both milk produced over the available quota and waste milk can be used (Vasseur et al., 2010). Nevertheless, using whole milk and especially waste milk poses some risks, such as the transmission of pathogens and the transfer of drug residues to calves (Selim and Cullor, 1997). In the present study, no effect of milk feeding management on the appearance of diarrhea was found. This might be due to the high similarity in feeding management between farms.",

These results have to be interpreted with care as farms were visited only once and, therefore, results represent a snapshot.

Nevertheless, associations between respiratory tract disease and diarrhea in calves have been observed by other authors (Johnson et al., 2013; Woolums et al., 2013). The association can be explained by a lack of hygiene and impairment of the calf immunity, which predisposes calves to different multifactorial diseases. Furthermore, one disease may negatively affect calf performance and consequently predispose to other diseases. Pathogens such as coronaviruses often present on farms and have a predilection for the intestinal and respiratory tract (Boileau and Kapil, 2010).",

In contrast, other areas, such as hygiene measures, differed between farms and showed, in part, a significant association with the presence of calf diarrhea on the farm. Variables significantly related to diarrhea on farm were farm size, presence of other farm animals on the farm, cleaning of the calving area after each calving, placement of individual calf housing, and the presence of respiratory tract disease. Consequently, the possible influence of these factors on the appearance of calf diarrhea should be taken into account.
