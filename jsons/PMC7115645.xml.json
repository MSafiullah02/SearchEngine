Many classical PEDV live vaccines, including CV777, Japan 83P-5, and Korea DR13 strains (all without pathogenicity), induced robust immune responses in sows and succeeded to control classical PEDV infections in pig farms for three decades [4], [5], [6]. CV777 for example was isolated from pigs during a PED outbreak in Belgium in 1976 and the attenuated vaccine strain was prepared via serial passaging of the strain in cell cultures. This strain has been widely used in Asian countries, where it provided effective immunological protection in herds for almost two decades [7], [8]. However, these traditional attenuated PEDV vaccines typically displayed lower serum antibody titers against emerging PEDV strains after 2011, suggesting that classical PEDV vaccine strains may only provide partial cross-protection against highly virulent strains. The low immune protective efficiency was attributed to the remarkable antigenic variation of structure proteins and major antigen sites between classical and emerging PEDV isolates [2], [8].",

At necropsy, both intestine and other major organs were examined. The jejunum samples (three samples were taken at 40\u201360 cm intervals) were placed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated in graded alcohol, embedded in paraffin, and directly cut to 5 \u03bcm sections onto microscope slides; four micron sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were prepared and tested via immunofluorescence (IFA) for the detection of PEDV antigens.",

Phylogenetic analysis of all 40 isolates based on S-gene nucleotides and deduced aa indicated that Zhejiang08 isolates clustered with several of the PEDV epidemic strains of recent years and most of attenuated vaccine isolates; however, the neutralizing epitopes in the S protein of the strains were highly homologous compared to all selected isolates. In addition, it is worth noting that the high homology of the COE epitope between Zhejiang08 and most of the prevailing strains isolated since the 2011 PEDV pandemic were clustered into one independent big group, thus revealing Zhejiang08 as a good candidate for vaccination.",

            "text": "As the most important post-translational modification of the PEDV spike protein, the main feature of N-linked glycosylation was the attachment of a high mannose core to the amide nitrogen of asparagine in the context of the conserved Asn-X-Ser/Thr motif [13]. Via comparison and analysis of the NetNGlyc predicted results of the S protein and compared to Zhejiang08, we found that three and one additional glycosylation sites may have formed in the S proteins of AH2012 and CV777, respectively. Our results revealed that glycan has the ability to form a barrier, thus shielding the antigen of a potential virus and neutralizing epitopes, and influencing the identification and immune response of downstream elements [9]. To further analyze the potential influence on the immunogenicity of the S protein by glycosylation sites, we compared the spatial position of n-glycosylation sites via the homology modeling method. However, to our surprise, we found that two extra aa n-glycosylation sites ASN300 and ASN381 completely covered the sequence between positions 249 and 529 of the AH2012 S protein. Furthermore, the site ASN296 in the S protein of CV777 also proved to be partially hidden in this region. A previous study has reported a potential porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) binding site in this region of the PEDV S protein [30], [31], [32]. It has been reported that PEDV uses porcine APN as its receptor, consequently enabling the virus to enter into host cells and to recognize immune cells, which is initiated via binding of the S protein to this cellular receptor [33]. Therefore, we suggest that the difference of the immune efficiency between CV777 and Zhejiang08 could partly be attributed to epitope exposure and cell binding, influenced by additional glycosylation sites. Moreover, in AH2012 and other highly virulent viruses that have emerged since 2011, the two additional glycosylation sites were likely acquired by selective pressure, thus providing a more complete shielding to this region, which may be associated with viral escape from the immune system. However, future studies could involve the generation of specific mutants, using reverse genetics to validate our suggestion.",
