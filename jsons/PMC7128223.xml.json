Chloroquine, and its hydroxyl analogue hydroxychloroquine, became plausible candidates for treatment of several viral diseases after many reports of their in-vitro inhibitory effects on different viruses.2 Although these effects proved highly reproducible,2 the antiviral effects of chloroquine in vivo have been shown only in a mouse model for coronavirus infection.3 The antiviral effect of hydroxychloroquine was shown in two clinical trials of individuals infected with HIV-1;4, 5 the results, however, could not be reproduced with an equivalent dose of chloroquine.6\n",

Therefore, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could still be considered for treatment in combination with other antiviral drugs. An effect that merits consideration is inhibition, by chloroquine, of some cellular proteins, including the P-glycoprotein and multidrug-resistance-associated proteins, which extrude drugs from the cells and other anatomic compartments.8 Although current anti-influenza drugs act on extracellular or transmembrane targets, new intracytosolic drug targets in the viral life cycle are being explored.9\n",

One reason behind this agreement is suggested by a recent study of hydroxychloroquine,12 which showed that the drug accumulates at high concentrations in lymphoid tissues of patients infected with HIV. These reproducible in-vivo effects of quionoline antimalarials could be used as, or added to, new strategies for restricting the HIV reservoir, which are aimed at counteracting the residual immune activation during antiretroviral therapy (favouring sustained viral replication in anatomic sanctuaries), and targeting activation or proliferation of central and transitional memory T cells harbouring silent copies of the HIV proviral DNA (contributing to maintenance of the virus's genome during treatment).11 Notwithstanding the poor efficacy of chloroquine for influenza prevention, the results reported by Paton and colleagues1 will help to address the process of drug repositioning for treatment of infectious diseases.",
