            "text": "We all live, suffer, and prosper in a world of bacteria and viruses. The damage caused by bacteria as infectious agents\u2014ie, invaders of host tissues and disease-causing organisms\u2014is well accepted. Bacteria can trigger various diseases, many of which affect the respiratory tract. During the prenatal period and early childhood, bacterial infections can affect intrauterine lung development during important developmental time windows.1 Bacteria not only cause infections that elicit adaptive immune responses, but also populate habitats in our body in large numbers, outnumbering human cells about ten-fold. Besides metabolic functions, the microbiome\u2014ie, the collective genomes of microbes living inside and on the human body\u2014has a major effect on the development of immune responses early in life. Mice raised under germ-free conditions show several deficiencies in immune responses and are prone to the development of experimental asthma.2 Reconstitution of the gut microbiome of germ-free mice with microbiota from mice raised in specific pathogen-free conditions corrects these deficits, but only when administered early in life.2 The role of the lung microbiome in turn is less well known. Several studies3, 4, 5, 6 have reported specific colonisation with proteobacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage samples and sputum of patients with asthma. But whether this type of colonisation precedes the onset of asthma or occurs secondary to airway inflammation remains to be elucidated. Viruses are generally known as causes of disease and have been associated with upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs).7, 8 Numerous studies7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 have linked early viral LRTIs to the development of childhood wheeze and asthma. The nature of this association is, however, not completely clear. Viruses might predispose to the onset of wheeze and asthma, but it is equally conceivable that viral infections merely unmask host factors underlying disease susceptibility. Alternatively, both notions might be justified: viruses might trigger wheeze and asthma and thereby aggravate airway inflammation.15, 18 The role of the bacterial microbiome in shaping immune responses to virus infections is currently unknown.",

Several prospective studies and a few studies of population-based cohorts have investigated children admitted to hospital for symptomatic LRTIs (table\n).10, 17, 29, 30, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 Several of these studies30, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 undertook analyses of both HRVs and RSV. In the longitudinal Tucson Children's Respiratory Study,10 viral LRTI during the first 3 years of life was an independent determinant of wheeze at age 6 years (table). This risk decreased until age 11\u201313 years and was accompanied by a reduction in forced expiratory volume during 1 s and increased responsiveness to salbutamol, implying a lasting change in the regulation of airway smooth muscle tone.10 Finnish studies38, 41 replicated this finding and showed that the risk of asthma conferred by virus-induced LRTI might decrease over time (table). Another important population-based birth-cohort, the Tennessee Asthma Bronchiolitis Study (TABS),33 investigated children that were admitted to hospital or visited outpatient and emergency departments with symptoms of bronchiolitis secondary to viral LRTI. Although the risk of asthma was generally increased after viral LRTI during infancy, this risk was also dependent on the age of the child at the peak of the virus season with a maximum risk for those infants aged around 121 days.33 Furthermore, the risk differed between winter months, probably dominated by RSV infections, and non-winter months, probably dominated by HRV infections (table).46, 47 In support of these findings, a further study48 extended the population of the TABS cohort and added a further Californian population; investigators reported that about 13% of childhood asthma cases were attributable to infant LRTIs during the RSV season.",

The first GWAS of asthma described the GSDMB-ORMDL3 locus on chromosome 17q21, which has been replicated in many populations and has the greatest effect on childhood-onset asthma.64, 65, 66 Notably, Smit and coworkers67 did an association analysis in children from the Epidemiological Study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma (EGEA) and showed that neither the effect of 17q21 risk alleles nor of early LRTI on asthma are independent of each other. Odds ratios (ORs) for early-onset asthma after early LRTI were higher for carriers of risk alleles (3\u00b742\u20136\u00b736) than for non-carriers (1\u00b784\u20132\u00b744, pinteraction 0\u00b7008\u20130\u00b705).67 These findings suggest that early RTIs uncover carriers of risk and enhance detrimental viral effects. \u00c7ali\u015fkan and coworkers68 confirmed this notion by investigation of children from the Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) study, and replicated the findings in individuals from the Copenhagen Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC), both high-risk cohorts. The investigators showed that 17q21 variants increased the risk of asthma and that HRV-induced LRTI modified this risk in both cohorts. ORs for asthma in homozygous risk allele carriers of rs7216389 were 26\u00b71 in the COAST study (3\u00b79 in COPSAC) if the children had at least one HRV-induced LRTI compared with 0\u00b78 (0\u00b77 in COPSAC) if there was no previous HRV-LRTI (pinteraction \u22640\u00b701 vs 0\u00b708 in COPSAC).68 Thomsen and coworkers49 did a retrospective analysis of data from the large Danish twin registry and used advanced genetic variance components models and direction of causation models to show that RSV infection was an indicator of genetic predisposition to asthma, but does not seem to cause asthma (table).",

Atopy and allergic disease are independently associated with subsequent asthma.61 The association between early and persistent sensitisation and asthma lasts through early childhood and into adulthood.22, 61 Sensitisation to inhalant allergens during childhood is associated with decreased lung growth, which is an independent risk factor for asthma later in life.22, 61 Studies of two Australian birth cohorts, the population-based Raine Study and the high-risk Childhood Asthma Study (CAS),30, 42, 43, 69, 70 investigated the potential role of atopic sensitisation in the complex interplay with viral infections. In the Raine Study,69 sensitisation at age 6 years was associated with an increased risk of current asthma, but this risk was higher if study participants had LRTI during the first year of life. In the CAS, Kusel and coworkers42 reported that the risk of both current asthma at 5 years (diagnosed by a doctor) and persistent wheeze (which started before age 3 years and persisted until age 5 years) was increased after HRV-induced LRTI compared to outcome without exposure, whereas after RSV-induced LRTI, the risk was only increased for wheeze (table). This increased risk was, however, restricted to children sensitised by age 2 years.42 Results from follow-up at age 10 years showed similar trends.43 Children with virus-induced, particularly febrile, LRTIs were at increased risk of asthma and wheeze, which was pronounced if the children were sensitised by age 2 years (table).43 In the COAST study (table), the risk of wheeze at age 3 years and 6 years was increased after either HRV-induced or RSV-induced LRTI during the first 3 years of life.40, 44 Early sensitisation was a predisposing factor in the time course of events preceding the development of wheeze.39\n",

In Smit and coworkers'67 analysis of children from the EGEA study, ETS exposure further enhanced the effects of early viral LRTIs on 17q21 risk allele carriers.

Children and adults with asthma seem to be primarily colonised with gammaproteobacteria\u2014ie, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n3\u20136,96 However, in individuals with asthma, whether this pattern of colonisation occurs secondary to airway epithelium damage, impaired barrier function, and inflammatory changes in the airways21, 23, 97 or is a primary cause of the disease remains to be elucidated. One birth cohort study3 suggests that colonisation of the hypopharynx with H influenzae, M catarrhalis, and S pneumoniae very early in life precedes the onset of asthma. Notably, this risk associated with colonisation at 1 month of age was independent of colonisation at later timepoints, suggesting a potential window of opportunity for disease development.3 However, because these findings were from children of mothers who had asthma, generalisation of the results is limited. Moreover, the investigators used conventional culture methods;3 studies that use DNA-based techniques are needed because they might identify an increased variety of microbiota. Furthermore, whether these findings truly reflect colonisation of the lower airway mucosa remains unclear because these studies used either bronchoalveolar lavage samples, sputum samples, or samples from the hypopharynx. Although bacteria might colonise mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract and fluid and sputum in the lower airways, true colonisation of mucosal surfaces in the lower respiratory tract remains a matter of debate.",

Benn and coworkers99 did a population-based cohort study in Denmark, and showed that the composition of the maternal vaginal microflora affected wheeze of their offspring during the first 3 years of life, and affected risk of asthma in children aged 4\u20135 years. Whereas Ureaplasma urealyticum was associated with infant wheeze only (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2\u00b70), Staphylococcus aureus (adjusted OR 2\u00b72) and maternal antibiotic use during pregnancy (adjusted OR 1\u00b77) were associated with asthma in the child at 5 years of age as defined by use of asthma-specific medication.99 However, the data for U urealyticum were unaffected by adjustment for antibiotic treatment. Moreover, U urealyticum has been shown to invade the amniotic sac, where it can reproduce.99 Keski-Nisula and coworkers100 reported that intrauterine growth of potential pathogenic bacteria such as Bacteroides spp, Clostridium spp, and Streptococcus spp were associated with doctor-diagnosed asthma at age 15\u201317 years.",

Because of conflicting results and safety issues in infants and immunocompromised individuals, at present no evidence supports prebiotic (containing nutrients such as oligosaccharides fostering growth of beneficial bacteria in the colon), probiotic (beneficial bacteria), or synbiotic (containing both nutrients and beneficial bacteria) manipulation of the gastrointestinal microbiome to effectively prevent asthma.127 Furthermore, evidence for use of the bacteria mix Broncho-Vaxom (OM-85 BV) consisting of H influenzae, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella ozaenae, S aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, and Neisseria catarrhalis is insufficient.125 Although the evidence of any benefit of microbial products is weak, future developments in their application for the prevention and treatment of asthma are in progress.
