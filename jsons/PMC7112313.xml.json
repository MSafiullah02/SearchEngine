Although generally well tolerated for short-term relief, some agents can have adverse effects, especially in young children. Therefore the US Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning against the use of over-the-counter cough and cold products in children younger than 4 years of age.9 Furthermore, the use of decongestants should be minimized, especially in children,10 whereas codeine has been restricted in children by the European Medical Agency since 2015.11 Selective COX inhibitors, such as celecoxib and mesalazine, have been widely used in clinics for their antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties in patients with airway diseases,12 whereas their combination with neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) has significantly improved the survival of IFV-infected mice.13\n",

Impaired interferon production has been observed in patients with various obstructive respiratory diseases, potentially contributing to enhanced susceptibility to and/or severity of virus-induced acute airway exacerbations.21 Although inhaled IFN-\u03b2 supplementation has not shown a clear effect in preventing virus-induced symptom worsening in patients with mild asthma, subanalysis in patients with severe asthma showed a protective effect.22 Interestingly, in an experimental model exogenous administration of IFN-\u03bb1 induced a strong and more prolonged antiviral state than IFN-\u03b2.23 Moreover, experimental studies in an allergic asthma model showed that IFN-\u03bb supplementation enhanced TH1 immunity by inducing IFN-\u03b3 and suppressing TH2 and TH17 responses through modulation of lung CD11c+ dendritic cell function.24, 25 Novel antibody-based drugs with antirhinovirus and immunomodulatory effects act through IFN-\u03b2 induction and suppression of TH2 responses in experimental models.26\n",

Additional challenges need to be overcome, such as the structural variation of viral proteins, multiple genotypes, and high mutation rates. Accordingly, only a very limited number of specific antiviral drugs are currently licensed, and promising approaches mostly aim to control severe complications, reduce disease burden, or transmission.

It is likely that many of these strategies will find a relevant indication: antiviral strategies will most probably make sense in severe life-threatening situations or when a window of opportunity is clearly present, such as in specific virus seasons and susceptible populations. Ideally, prevention at a wide scale through immunization will be able to reduce the overall burden of respiratory infections with a huge effect. This appears to be within reach for RSV and IFV, whereas additional effort is needed toward rhinovirus. In the meantime, symptomatic and immunostimulatory measures provide relief, and they hold promise in relation to postviral reactive airway disease. Public health measures should be expanded because they can be critical in reducing the effect and contain potential epidemics.",

D, Naked nucleic acids are also used as vaccines. E, Nanoparticle vaccines encompass natural and synthetic materials. Membranes can be used to make liposomes to contain and deliver an antigen to a target cell. F, Viruses can have nucleic acid and core protein removed to form virosomes. G, Viral proteins, such as HA stalks or antigens, can be engineered onto immunogenic core proteins (eg, ferritin or vaults). This example is HA on ferritin adapted from PBD codes 3BVE and 5C0S. H, Viruses, such as the vaccinia virus Ankara, with coat proteins and genetic material removed can be engineered to express other antigens, such as influenza M2 ion channel protein. I, VLPs can be engineered to express antigens and naturally glycosylated proteins and have adjuvants incorporated into the coat. PAMP, Pathogen-associated molecular pattern.
