Similar to other coronavirus S protein, IBV S protein is a type I glycoprotein and forms the peplomers on virion particles giving the crown-like appearance. The protein contains two glycopolypeptides S1 (90 kDa) and S2 (84 kDa) in equimolar proportions (Cavanagh, 1983) (\nFig. 1a). The S1 subunit is believed to form the globular head of the protein and contains a receptor binding domain (Kubo et al., 1994). The carboxy terminal S2 subunit, however, is conserved among all coronavirus spikes and forms a stalk-like structure that is embedded in the membrane (Masters, 2006). Overall this gives the spike protein a teardrop shaped structure (Masters, 2006). Mutagenesis of the terminal heptad repeats and the predicted fusion peptides severely compromises SARS-CoV S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion (Petit et al., 2005). S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion is also dependent on a cysteine rich domain in the protein itself (Chang et al., 2000). Yet another point mutation, glutamine to leucine at position 294 of the IBV spike S1 subunit hampers processing of the protein into a matured protein capable of being translocated to the cell surface (Shen et al., 2004).",

One of its most common forms is the N-linked glycosylation. This involves a high mannose core being attached to the amide nitrogen of asparagine (N), within a conserved motif Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X is any amino acid except for proline). In the ER, this mannose core is added in the form of a block of fourteen sugars, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 (Balzarini, 2007). The mannose oligosaccharide then moves through the ER and Golgi apparatus, during which it is altered to form different structures (Vigerust and Shepherd, 2007). Coronavirus S proteins typically contain 23\u201330 N-linked glycosylation sites, depending on the species in question. The protein is post-translationally glycosylated in the ER (Delmas and Laude, 1990), following which it is transported through the Golgi apparatus where high mannose oligosaccharides are trimmed and the protein further acylated.",

Mutagenesis analyses of SARS-CoV S protein have identified seven glycosylation sites critical for DC/L-SIGN-mediated entry, an alternative site for SARS-CoV entry (Han et al., 2007). Interestingly, mutation of multiple sites together did not have a synergistic effect on entry (Han et al., 2007). On the other hand, mutation of a single N-linked glycosylation site (N330) abolishes the specific interaction between SARS-CoV S protein and mannose-binding lectin, a serum protein that serves an important function in host defenses during opsonization and complement activation (Zhou et al., 2010).",

These results and those from other viruses show that the glycans on the S protein provide great avenues and potential for further exploration and understanding, particularly in the area of protein mediated fusion. Carbohydrate binding agents may be a useful tool in combating viral pathogenesis in future. As described by Balzarini in 2007, these agents may act via a dual mechanism of antiviral action, by firstly binding to the glycans and subsequently blocking virus entry, or by creating deletions in the \u201cglycan shield\u201d of a particular viral surface, inducing the immune system to act against otherwise hidden immunogenic epitopes. Before this becomes a full-fledged antiviral method, more work needs to be done to characterize the function of carbohydrates in these viruses, in particular, the S protein here.",

The PNGase F digestion results in the release of the N-linked glycans into the solvent and the glycosylated N within the N-linked glycosylation sequence motif N-X-S/T/C could be converted to D by incorporating extra oxygen derived from the solvent (\nFig. 2a). In addition, deglycosylation occurring in H2O18 environment instead of H2O16 enables incorporation of O18 to Asp which results in a mass increment of 2.98 Da, leading to more robust identification of glycosylated sites (Fig. 2a). However, Asn deamidation also occurs during sample preparation. Asn is converted to a succinimide intermediate that could further hydrolyze rapidly to produce L-Aspartic acid and L-iso Aspartic acid, typically in a 1:3 ratio (Geiger and Clarke, 1987). It is thus possible that Asn deamidation in H2O18 will lead to the mass increment of 2.98 Da. To avoid false positives, a control without addition of PNGase F would be set up for direct comparison with PNGase F mediated deglycosylation.",

A control was used to exclude any false positive caused by chemical deamination that can happen spontaneously during sample preparation. The functional importance of 13 N-glycosylation sites in Cluster I on IBV S protein-mediated membrane fusion, infectivity and replication was characterized using mutagenesis analysis via both transfection of mutant S proteins and construction of recombinant viruses. In SARS-CoV S protein, certain positions are suggested to be of importance for binding to cellular components, such as L-SIGN and DC-SIGN (Han et al., 2007). IBV S protein-mediated fusion is not well understood, and the importance of the S1 region of the protein in fusion is largely unknown. With the postulation that glycans may play an important function, the presence of a large number of glycosylation sites in this region suggests that it may play a role in this process.

Positions N212 and N276, which are confirmed by LC\u2013MS/MS, in particular show high influence when analyzed both for cell-cell fusion and recovery of infectious virus. Although the targeted sites were mutated to remove glycosylation, there is a possibility though that the changes present were down to the mutations in amino acids, rather than the absence of glycans themselves. As mentioned earlier the change in molecular mass is minimal, both amino acids also having similar polar side chains and hydropathy index. Taking the various protein folding forces into consideration, it is thus unlikely that any conformational and binding changes as proposed earlier are due to the amino acids themselves. Given that glycans modify protein structures and assist in folding and interaction, it is likely that they are the factors that determine the phenotypic changes.",

This seemingly under-representation could be partially attributed to the massive amount of IBV S protein produced during IBV infection and the limited capacities of the host cell glycosylation enzymes. It is possible that due to their better spatial availability or other unknown advantages, the asparagine residues at these 8 sites were preferentially modified by glycosylation. The remaining sites were either inefficiently glycosylated, or they might miss the chance of modification because the partially glycosylated IBV S protein has already been transported to the next compartment where glycosylation enzymes are no longer available. It is also possible that there exists a detection limit for LC-MS/MS set up during the time for sample analysis. When one or more of the confirmed glycosylation sites in S protein was mutated, the cellular glycosylation enzymes might be \u201cfreed up\u201d, so that N-linked glycosylation of the remaining sites could be observed in theory. This could be studied by determining the N-linked glycosylation of virus particles from mutant recombinant IBVs using LC-MS/MS analysis. Glycosylation of these \u201credundant\u201d sites might be able to functionally complement the mutations on the \u201ccanonical\u201d sites, explaining why several of the rIBV with these mutations could still be successfully recovered and grew well in cell culture.",

To this end, the same residue was mutated to glutamine, and it was found that the N283Q mutant supports both cell-cell fusion and virus recovery. Therefore, it is concluded that the critical function of N283 is independent of N-linked glycosylation. While N to D mutation involves a change in charge, there is no net change in charge but only a small size increase of side chain for N to Q mutation. Thus, N283 might be positioned in a crucial domain in IBV S protein, in which even minor charge (but not size) changes would disrupt delicate internal electrostatic interactions and lead to drastic modifications of protein structure and function.",

Each peplomer consists of two to three spike molecules already cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits. It is possible that the two subunits need to interact in a certain way to form a proper peplomer as well as to facilitate binding to cellular receptors as the virus approaches the cell. Once again, the presence or absence of glycans on the S1 region may affect its interaction with the S2 region, thus affecting binding, or even the formation of proper peplomers on complete viral particles. This may help to explain why several of the mutant S proteins cannot induce cell-cell fusion, as well as failing to recover recombinant mutants. The observations that very low cleavage bands were seen when some mutant S proteins were expressed suggest that mutations at some glycosylation sites may also affect cleavage efficiency, although the glycosylation sites near the cleavage site were not mutated.",

N-linked glycosylation significantly increases the size of S protein, and has been shown to promote its folding and trimerization (Delmas and Laude, 1990). Therefore, it is reasonable to propose that changes of N-linked glycosylation status in the cluster I mutants may modify the proper folding, processing and/or trimerization of the S protein, thus affecting its proteolytic cleavage pattern and compromising its fusogenic functions. In the schematic diagram of Fig. 1a, Cluster I glycans are shown to be in the N-terminus region of IBV S protein and do not cover the S1/S2 cleavage site and the fusion peptide. However, in the fully folded and trimerized coronavirus S protein, the S1 subunits are closely associated with the S2 subunits. In fact, in a recent publication showing the cryo-electron microscopy structure of MHV S trimer, the fusion peptides were exposed in the periphery, and positioned very closed to the major antigenicity determinant in the S1 subunit (Walls et al., 2016). If the cluster I N-linked glycosylation sites were located closed to critical regions of the S2 subunit, the presence/absence of N-linked glycans could affect the cleavage and/or fusion ability. This may explain why some N to D or N to Q mutants in the cluster I sites could affect the S1/S2 ratio or cell-cell fusion of the overexpressed S protein.",

            "text": "In this study, we have identified 13 potential N-linked glycosylation sites in cluster I of the IBV S protein. Among them, four (N212, N237, N247 and N276) have been confirmed to be N-linked glycosylated in S protein originated from partially purified virions by proteomics studies. N to D/Q mutations in N212 and N276 were found to abolish the infectivity of the recombinant IBV. The receptor binding domain (RBD) on the S1 subunit of each coronavirus may vary, with RBD of MHV located at the N-terminus (Kubo et al., 1994), SARS-CoV at the center (Wong et al., 2004), and TGEV and HCoV-229E at the C-terminus (Bonavia et al., 2003, Godet et al., 1994) of the S1 region. For the M41 strain of IBV, the RBD has been mapped to the N-terminal 253 residues of the S protein, which was both necessary and sufficient for 2,3-sialic acid-dependent binding to chicken respiratory tract (Promkuntod et al., 2014). Interestingly, N212 was located within this putative RBD, while N276 was also very closely positioned. However, the involvement of N-linked glycans at these two sites for IBV (strain Beaudette) receptor binding, both in cell culture and in vivo, requires further investigations. Nonetheless, the importance of N-linked glycosylation on receptor binding and viral infectivity has been well documented for SARS-CoV. For example, seven glycosylation sites (N109, N118, N119, N158, N227, N589 and N699) in SARS-CoV S protein have been shown to be critical for virus entry mediated by the C-type lectin DC-SIGN and L-SIGN (Han et al., 2007). Furthermore, mannose-binding lectin (MBL) has been shown to interact with SARS-CoV S-pseudotyped virus and block viral binding to DC-SIGN, with another glycosylation site (N330) on the SARS-CoV S protein found to be critical for MBL binding (Zhou et al., 2010). It is intriguing that even if these N-link glycans may not directly participate in receptor binding, they may be recognized by different lectin proteins and modulate the immune response during viral infection.",

Since glycosylation patterns in different host cells differ, viruses such as the West Nile Virus have been shown to be able to exploit different host glycosylation profiles to escape such mechanisms, via exerting a specific cytokine blocking effect (Arjona et al., 2007). Other studies also showed that type I interferon and TNF-\u03b1 are further examples of substances differentially induced by varied glycosylation profiles. It is possible that depriving the IBV S of certain glycans may alter its profile and make it more susceptible to antiviral actions by the host cell. The possibility that recombinant IBV with glycosylation-defective at certain positions recovered in this study may be used to study such virus-host interaction would be worth exploring.",

Carbohydrate binding agents have been shown to elicit favorable responses in HIV infected cells, able to inhibit fusion of cell free HIV particles with susceptible cells and also the formation of syncytia between persistently infected and uninfected cells (Balzarini et al., 1991). They are also able to prevent capture of viruses by DC-SIGN and the subsequent transmission of viruses to T-cells (Wang et al., 2008). Carbohydrate binding agents are unique as they will interact directly with the glycans present on the glycoproteins, thus need not be taken up by cells. Also multiple binding of these agents to the glycoprotein exerts a high genetic barrier, which means that if the virus was to mutate and evolve resistance by deletion of its N-glycans, several mutations need to accumulate in the protein before a significant phenotypic drug resistance occurs. Whereas other drugs only require a couple of mutations to evolve resistance, this method of antiviral treatment offers a more stable effect (Balzarini, 2007). With the gradual improvement and increase in significance of carbohydrate binding agents as antivirals, the IBV S glycoprotein should also come into the picture as one of the targets. This would also lead to similar uses in other coronaviruses such as the SARS-CoV. Identifying regions of glycans that exert the most influence on viral infectivity and pathogenesis may facilitate design of such binding agents.",

In fact, overexpression of the S protein of SARS-CoV and MHV induces potent ER stress in cell culture (Chan et al., 2006, Versteeg et al., 2007), while one or more of the three UPR branches are activated in cells infected with SARS-CoV, MHV, TGEV and IBV (Fung et al., 2014b, Fung and Liu, 2014, Liao et al., 2013). However, the involvement of N-glycan in spike-induced ER stress has not been fully investigated. In a previous study, overexpression of SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 spike proteins with multiple putative N-glycosylation site mutated was shown to activate UPR reporter similarly to the wild type protein (Siu et al., 2014). Nevertheless, the implication of spike protein N-glycosylation on cellular stress responses and other aspects of virus-host interactions should be further investigated under the context of actual infection.",
