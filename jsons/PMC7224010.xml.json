The above principles include implementation of the program only when sufficient scientific evidence (with proven effects on the mortality as the end-point) is available and following thorough cost effectiveness analysis, precise definition of the target population as well as invitation strategy, piloting of a screening system, setting up a robust quality assurance system before the system is launched in full operation.",

Reducing antibiotic exposure should minimize the duration and extent of disruption of the microbiome, thereby reducing collateral damage and improving patient outcomes.

More profound reduction of the gastric acidity also could contribute to a higher effectiveness of the therapy. Sugimoto and Yamaoka [64] have recently reviewed the effectiveness of PCAB in H. pylori eradication therapies compared to the traditional PPI containing therapies, and demonstrated significant advantages of the PCAB. Therefore, one directions for future therapies could be PCAB and high-dose (multiple dose) amoxicillin in combination.

The authors estimated that the total hidden cost attributable to each ambulatory antibiotic prescription was $13 (range: $3\u201395), and each ambulatory antibiotic prescription would increase antibiotic costs by 65% (range: 15\u2013475%), if the cost of the resistance was incorporated into antibiotic costs paid by patients or payers [92]. Applying this estimate to the cost-effectiveness estimates of H. pylori eradication and modelling the costs of resistome for other countries globally probably would change the very beneficial cost-effectiveness picture of screen-and-treat strategy. The cost-effectiveness estimates should also incorporate those of organizing the activities and governance of the process, exactly as in traditional cancer screening program settings [93].",
