Almost all women (13 of14) had a cesarean delivery, all with an uncomplicated neuraxial anesthesia and no neurological complications. That neuraxial anesthesia is safe in women with COVID-19 is reassuring, given that it is always preferred to general anesthesia, and specifically to avoid viral aerosolization and wastage of dwindling medical equipment and PPE.",

Current recommendations include airborne protection for all aerosolizing procedures such as endotracheal intubation during general anesthesia.2,3 However, universal testing has not been available in most institutions in the United States, and women may be asymptomatic when admitted in the laborand deliveryunit in spontaneous labor. Further, the signs and symptoms of labor, including shortness of breath, fever in labor, diarrhea, myalgias, and chest tightness, may overlap with symptoms of COVID-19 and obscure the diagnosis.",

A healthy, asymptomatic multiparous woman was admitted for induction of labor at 37 weeks ofgestation for gestation diabetes, and neuraxial analgesia was provided uneventfully. Hours later, an intrapartum cesarean delivery under epidural anesthesia was completed for prolonged second stage of labor and a diagnosis of chorioamnionitis with maternal fever. After delivery of the baby, a postpartum hemorrhage and atony treated with massive transfusion and uterotonics required conversion to general anesthesia; endotracheal intubation precipitated immediate and prolonged bronchospasm. Though bronchospasm could be attributed to carboprost tromethamine (Hemabate; Pharmacia & Upjohn Co, Division of Pfizer Inc, New York, NY), the degree of respiratory decompensation and the fever in labor prompted a nasal swab for COVID-19 testing, which came back positive 4 hours later.",
