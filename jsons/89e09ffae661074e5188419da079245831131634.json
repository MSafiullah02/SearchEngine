I also consider key highlights of the outbreak are the importance of collaboration across national and state borders and a balance between privacy and public health under such situations.",

We might have to note that \"wet market\" exists in many places around the globe, particularly in developing countries. While I agree in principle that such markets should be more regularly inspected and regulated, the livelihood of those relying on the practice needs to be balanced. In addition, research has pointed to the possibility that the virus might have been transmitting, mutating, and adapting among humans before it reached the Huanan wet market (Andersen, Rambaut, Lipkin, Holmes, & Garry, 2020).",

            "text": "On whether China had acknowledged the existence of an outbreak of respiratory illness, it is important to note that Dr. Redfield, Director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), received a call from his counterpart in China on January 3, 2020 about the outbreak (Shear et al., 2020) . What ensued in both countries is puzzling indeed. I share the disappointment and anger against delayed actions to a dire situation. Meanwhile, the US CDC did start to screen travelers from Wuhan on January 17 and the US imposed on January 31 an temporary suspend entry, additional screening, or possible quarantine for individuals that have visited mainland China in the past 14 days (Patel, Jernigan, & 2019 -nCoV CDC Response Team, 2020 . A recent study suggests that early cases of COVID-19 in New York City are primarily from European and US sources (The Mount Sinai Health System, 2020). I drew a slightly different conclusion from Dr. Mitroff's. COVID-19 has features that befuddled the world's best virologists and epidemiologists, including the existence of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic patients who may be contagious (Chen et al., 2020) , an incubation period ranging from two to 14 days (Bai et al., 2020) , and an estimated case fatality rate of 1-3% and an R 0 of approximately 2.2 (Li et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020) . With these features, COVID-10 triumphs over any border, be it between nations, between states, or even across the Pacific and the Atlantic which had been considered the insurmountable borders of the US. I dare to make two suggestions. First, globalization will continue but will require collaboration between nations. Unless we want to transition the countries into fiefdoms, we will need trade and human mobility, and in turn, close collaboration to battle the next pandemic. Second, the US Constitution has given the states sovereignty over public health but dealing with pathogens like SARS-COV-2 (the virus causes COVID-19) would require effective coordination across states. It would necessitate constitutional law scholars to sit down with the federal and state governments and have a long and hopefully productive conversation.",

Balancing the mission to control a pandemic, technology, and privacy concerns would be an excellent topic of future research for a team of ethicists, informaticians, and legal scholars.",
