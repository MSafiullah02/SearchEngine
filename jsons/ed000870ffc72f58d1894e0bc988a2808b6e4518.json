Information has been derived from studies performed on laboratory animals with experimentally induced liver injury as well as humans and animals with spontaneous disease. Research endeavours have examined mechanisms from a fundamental molecular level to attain a better understanding of how complex biological processes culminate in cholestasis and/or hepatobiliary inflammation and fibrosis. It is hoped that this growth in knowledge will lend reason, objectivity and sound scientific logic to clinical management strategies.",

These can be divided anatomically into areas of gross involvement (vascular, parenchymal, biliary structures) and on the basis of histological characteristics, including lobular distribution, the presence or absence of inflammation, type of inflammation (suppurative, non-suppurative or mixed infiltrate), and the presence, localisation and severity of fibrosis. Recognition and classification of chronic hepatitis therefore requires liver biopsy, with acquisition of enough tissue to make accurate diagnostic appraisals. The recent common use of needle biopsy sampling using ultrasonographic guidance has led to inadequate sample collection from some patients. A minimum of 15 portal triads should be observed to ascertain the presence or absence of a periportal/portal lesion.",

All cell components defining this space participate in the synthesis of the ECM, although most of the type I11 and IV collagen and laminin is synthesised by Ito and sinusoidal endothelial cells. During active hepatic fibrogenesis, however, Ito cells become the major ECM-producing cell, and the predominant producer of collagen (type I). As cirrhosis develops, changes in blood vessels, sinusoidal continuity and phenotypic behaviour of parenchymal and perisinusoidal cells develop simultaneously. Formation of regenerative nodules, encouraged by growth promoters (especially transforming growth factor-a [TGF-a]), impairs the hepatocyte-to-sinusoid orientation and perfusion (Fig 2) .",

Altered selective permeability and loss of dynamic fenestrations of sinusoidal endothelial cells and increased collagen deposition in the space of Disse transforms sinusoids so that they resemble systemic capillaries. This capillarisation impairs oxygen and nutrient availability and impairs metabolite exchange between hepatocytes and sinusoidal blood (Villeneuve and Huet 1387, Sherman and others 1770) . Oxygen consumption as well as delivery of oxygen to hepatocytes is therefore reduced in cirrhosis (Kamada and others 1386, Morgan and McLean 1391) . This may be critical for some patients, as even a small reduction in hepatic oxygen delivery can impair elimination of substances biotransformed by enzyme systems that use oxygen directly. Recent studies suggest that this is a major underlying cause of altered drug metabolism in liver disease ( ",

Immune complex deposition may precede tissue damage in some situations. The ECM can serve as a depot for inflammatory mediators and immune complexes and thus can sustain mediator release and inflammation long after the initiating event has resolved. Leucocytes migrating into an area of inflammation release lysosomal proteases and reactive radicals, disrupting normal ECM and cell structures. This liberates not only proinflammatory eicosanoids, but also peptides that function as chemoattractants for collagen-producing cells, neutrophils and macrophages. JOURNAI Transforming growth factor-(3 (TGF-P), produced by many cells, including Kupffer cells, lymphocytes, macrophages and platelets, is the best known of a family of low molecular weight soluble factors that stimulate collagen deposition by Ito cells (Pinzani 1995, Losser and Payen 1996) . This substance also impairs hepatocyte DNA synthesis, induces apoptosis and up-regulates cell adhesion receptors, favouring accumulation of inflammatory cells. These changes promote development of an architecturally deranged and fibrotic acinus. TGF-P also seems to retard collagen degradation which, along with its stimulatory influence on fibrogenesis, favours collagen accumulation.",

In most cases, xenobiotics become toxic after metabolic activation, primarily via the superfamily cytochrome p450 enzyme system. Cell damage from reactive intermediates can occur by two major mechanisms (Fig 3) (Losser and Payen 1996, Pumford and others 1997) . The first is direct toxicity, moderated by electrophiles that bind covalently to proteins or by free radicals that cause lipid peroxidation and protein thiol oxidation. These produce I Jh , 4) . This may result in either a hypersensitivity reaction or an 'auto' immune phenomenon. Rccent work has shown that some drugs that are metabolically activated by cytochrome p450 enzymes result in adduct formation while associated with the enzyme and thus generate a novel domain directing antibody formation against the enzyme (eg, tienilic acid, dihydralazine, phenytoin) (Manns and Obermayer-Straub 1997, Pumford and others 1997) . Hepatotoxicity caused by a drug via adduct formation or DNA injury manifests immediately and in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, liver damage in immune-mediated drug-induced hepatitis occurs after a significant lag-period, is independent of dose, does not occur after first exposure and is characterised by autoantibodies. Methods have been developed to detect and identify xenobiotics covalently bound to proteins as well as neoantigens and autoantibodies. Investigations have clarified the toxic properties and mechanisms of acetaminophen, galactosamine, carbon tetrachloride (CCI,), halothane and certain other drugs. Deficiencies in normal detoxification pathways such as sulphate or glucuronide conjugation, availability of reduced glutathione (GSH) or other free radical scavengers, increased formation of toxic adducts due to enzyme induction (phenobarbital enzyme induction), or reduced rate of adduct elimination as a result of patient exposure to enzyme inhibitors (eg, cimetidine, quinidine, chloramphenicol), can enhance toxicity of some agents. Copper and iron Accumulation of excess hepatocellular copper can develop due to inherited defects in copper transport or excretion, excessive copper intake, or secondary to cholestatic liver injury. Excessive iron can accumulate due to an inherited defect causing increased alimentary uptake in humans (haemochromatosis), excessive exogenous iron administration, haemolytic disease or chronic repeated blood transfusion. Increased Kupffer cell iron is commonly apparent histologically adjacent to areas of chronic inflammation. Copperand iron-induced hepatic damage is related to free radical-generated oxidant injury ( Fig 5) . Damage to membranes, including plasma, mitochondrial, lysosomal and microsomal, leads to cell energy deficits, abnormal microsomal enzyme function and deleterious changes in intracellular free calcium (Bacon and Tavill 1996, Zucker and Gollan 1996) . Copper and iron are also believed to initiate Ito cell activation and collagen synthesis directly.",

Whatever the cause, cholestasis leads to the accumulation of noxious bile acids, most notably the monohydroxy secondary bile acid lithocholic acid derived from chenodeoxycholic acid by enteric bacterial dehydroxylation. Lithocholic acid is a well recognised hepatotoxin known to induce a variety of metabolic and structural injuries. Because lithocholic acid is poorly water soluble, normally only small amounts are dispersed into the portal circulation and presented to the liver. Following hepatocellular uptake in extrahepatic cholestasis, cytosolic peptides direct lithocholate to the canalicular membrane where it binds inducing a deleterious decrease in membrane fluidity (Yousef and others 1977) . Membrane changes are associated with an altered cholesterol-tophospholipid ratio which compromises membrane integrity and function. Similar subcellular injury has been shown in all species studied and includes dilation of bile canaliculi, loss of canalicular microvilli and lamellar transformation of canalicular membranes (Miyai and others 1977) . Although lithocholate is not the only 'membranocytolytic' bile acid, it is the most noxious, with chronic exposure leading to cirrhosis. Accumulation of lithocholate, as well as other noxious bile acids, is thought to contribute to ongoing liver injury in patients with cholestasis and many different forms of chronic liver disease.",

Biliary tree damage results from eicosanoidmediated inflammation and oxidative injury, as well as from cytokines and mediators recruited into the area of inflammation. Biliary epithelial hyperplasia and bile ductule proliferation are early histological features. Classic histological changes of major duct occlusion include distension of the biliary structures, devitalisation of biliary epithelium, accumulation of necrotic debris and suppurative inflammation within the bile duct lumen, periportal accumulations of neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells and oedema, and multifocal parenchymal necrosis. Periportal fibrosis is usually obvious within weeks and evolves into an 'onion skin' appearance around bile ducts. In chronic cases, irreparable distension of large bile ducts develops.

In some of these disorders, lipid peroxidation is implicated as an early pathogenic feature (Tribble and others 1987, Paradis and others 1997) . Lipid peroxidation, initiated by attack of hydroxyl radicals on the unsaturated bonds of membrane phospholipids, propagates as an autocatalytic chain reaction involving highly reactive polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) radicals (Tribble and others 1987) . Cytotoxic metabolites damage membranes leading to cell dysfunction and death. In the circumstance of ATP depletion or oxidative stress, ATP metabolism generates xanthine, which serves as a substrate for generation of 0,.

These reactions can result from exposure of antigens normally hidden within hepatocellular membranes, cytosol or organelles, by alteration of normal surface antigens forming neoantigens, formation of haptens as occurs with certain drug metabolites, alteration in M H C expression (as previously described), or as a consequence of an abnormal immune response. Antigenic moieties involved are controversial and just how autoantibodies are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory liver disease remains unclear. None of the autoantibodies yet recognised have been shown to be pathological and are likely to be by-products of hepatocyte destruction. However, in humans, certain antigens and antibodies have diagnostic importance in differentiating between chronic hepatobiliary disorders. A list of antigens and antibodies associated with various forms of spontaneous and experimentally induced hepatobiliary disorders in man, experimental animal models and companion animal patients is summarised in Table 3 (Thomas 1988 , Anderson and Sevelius 1992 , Weiss and others 1995 , Czaja 1996 , Meyer zum Buschenfelde and Gerken 1996 , Poitout and others 1997 .",

Defective formation of a,-antitrypsin in humans is associated with emphysematous lung disease pathologically linked with unrestrained neutrophil elastase. Hepatic cirrhosis develops in a subset of patients deficient in al-antitrypsin. In these, globules of an amorphous PAS-positive diastase resistant material accumulates in hepatocytes, especially in periportal areas. How this is related aetiologically to hepatocellular injury has not been clarified. It has been suspected that some dogs with liver disease, particularly cocker spaniels, may have a deficiency of al-antitrypsin activity (Sevelius and others 1994) .",

Although differentiated hepatocytes and bile epirhelial cells are quiescent mitotically in a healthy adult liver, hepatic stem cells (oval cells) are capable of extended proliferation that can effectively support repair of either cell type. As long as the reticulin fibre scaffolding is retained and 'pluripotential' oval cells remain, regeneration can follow an orderly pattern resulting in almost complete tissue repair. Although the precise anatomical location of the hepatic stem cell compartment is not well defined, evidence indicates that these cells reside in bile ductules (Alpini and others 1994, Roberts and others 1997) . Recently identified proteins that may regulate cholangiocyte growth and proliferation include hepatocyte growth factor, epidermal growth factor, TGFa, proline, cholecystokinin and insulin-like growth factors. The reparative response of oval cells is recognised by most pathologists as bile duct proliferation and is a common histological feature observed in many forms of liver disease.",

The MHC class I foci are found on the surfaces of almost all nucleated cells and present antigen derived from intracellular proteins to CD8' T lymphocytes. These foci are required for programming efficient lysis of target cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The MHC class I1 foci are highly polymorphic glycoprotein receptors that bind peptide fragments derived from endocytosed extracellular proteins. Bound peptides (foreign and self-derived) are presented to helper T lymphocytes (CD4' lymphocytes) that are both peptidespecific and MHC-restricted (recognising a particular peptide only when presented by a particular class I1 molecule). Immune responsiveness is influenced by this array of polymorphic class I1 foci. Normally, macrophages (including Kupffer cells) and monocytes phagocytise antigens and then degrade them enzymatically into small antigenic peptides that fit into their MHC class I1 groove. These antigens are presented to a specific CD4' T cell which subsequently undergoes 'activation'. The activated CD4' T cell initiates a response through elaboration of inflammatory and cytotoxic mediators, cooperation with B cells and/or cytotoxic lymphocytes and, in some cases, induction of apoptosis. In humans, chronic viral hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis involve CD8' T cells and 'auto' immune forms of hepati-tis mostly involve CD4* T cells, B cells and plasma cells. Hepatocytes normally have low immunogenicity, expressing few MHC class I and no MHC class I1 molecules (Franc0 and others 1988, Innes and others 1988, Lobo-Yeo and others 1990, Arvieux and others 1993). The expression of MHC class I foci in liver is restricted normally to sinusoidal and biliary cells, while MHC class I1 foci are restricted to sinusoidal and dendritic cells. However, in pathological situations, hepatocytes express high numbers of MHC class I molecules and, in some chronic cholestatic disorders, M H C class 11 molecules are expressed in biliary epithelium (Fig",
