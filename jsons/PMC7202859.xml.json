            "text": "Mexico confirmed its first case of the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) on February 28th, 2020 [1]. On March 18th, 2020 the Mexican Health Secretariat reported that a total of 250,656 COVID-19 cases were expected in the country (this amounts to roughly a 0.19% of the total population of Mexico estimated around 130.8 million in 2018 [2]). If the pandemic is expected to last 90 days approximately (using the Wuhan case as an example), then a straightforward calculation shows that this number amounts to an average daily attack rate of 21.5 per million people. On March 19th, 2020 the Heath Secretariat informed [3] that 140,367 (56% of the expected cases) would be mild not requiring hospitalization, 24,564 (9.8%) will require hospitalization, but will not be critical, and 10,528 (4.2%) would be critical patients. Thus, the remaining 75,197 (30% of the expected cases) are asymptomatic carriers. This percentage agrees with the percentage reported by [4] which estimated the size of this population in 30.8%. On the same date, March 19th, it was informed [3] that the Mexican Health Federal Sector at that time had 4,291 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 2,053 ventilators ready for the contingency. On March 23rd, 2020 schools were closed and on March 30th, 2020 the general suspension of non-essential activities was announced [1]. All the recommendations pertained to so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions such as washing hands, keeping cough/sneeze etiquette, avoiding handshakes, keeping distance from other people, working at home. These activities require changes in behavior and, therefore, have a learning curve. Importantly, they can be forgotten, relaxed or only partially implemented in any given population.",

With respect to the time-varying effective contact rate, we introduce three parameters: the proportion of contact rate reduction desired to achieve (\u03b1), the expected time to achieve that reduction from its original value to the desired fraction (\u03b8), and the time lapse between the identification of the first cases to the implementation of the anti-COVID-19 control and mitigation measures (T\u03b8). For the incubation period distribution we use the infection-to-onset time reported in [5], [6], [7] that postulate a Gamma distribution with mean 5.1 days, and coefficient of variation 0.86 (but also see [8], [9], [10], [11] for similar estimates).",

We use the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Mexico City by date of symptoms onset, and the daily number of deaths [12]. The initial (pre-SEM) effective contact rates, ba, bs, the infectious periods, \u03b7a, \u03b7s, and mortality rate \u03bc were estimated using a Bayesian inference approach. Technical details can be found in A. We also estimated the mortality rate after March 23rd, 2020 (post-SEM) denoted by \u03bc\u2217. Table 1 shows the median values and 95% intervals for each parameter. Fig. A.3 shows the trajectory of the epidemic and the observed data. Using the median values presented in Table 1 for the effective contact rates and infectious periods, our median basic reproduction number works out to be R0=3.87, with a 95% credible interval of [2.955.89]. This reproduction number is below the recently reported value R0=5.7 for China given in [15].",

Therefore, we set \u03b81=150 days and \u03b82=150 days as the average learning times for the population fractions q and 1\u2212q, respectively. With these values, the contact rate reduction by April 30th, 2020, the announced initial date of lifting of SEM measures, are, respectively, 23% and 18% on average for both population fraction. On April 6th, 2020, this SEM end date was extended to May 30th, 2020, where our projected contact rate reductions are 41% and 32%, respectively. This assumption gives us a worst-case scenario where the behavioral changes required to lower the effective contact rate take a relatively long time to be adopted. The effective contact rate decreases linearly over time until the target reductions of \u03b11=0.1 and \u03b12=0.3 for the adherent and non-adherent sub-populations (reductions of 90% and 70%) were reached, respectively. Finally, we set 1\u2215\u03c9=200 days. The parameter 1\u2215\u03c9 represents the average time an individual is committed to all the behavioral requirements of effective social distancing (not leaving home, washing hands, frequently cleaning common surfaces, using masks, etc.). All these assumptions imply that the mitigation measures are always leaky, not every member of the community follows them but also that a substantial part of the population under SEM will keep a low-risk behavior even beyond the formal termination of SEM.",

As this same study points out, a high testing rate is recommended to adequately plan the lifting of mitigation restrictions already in place in many countries, including Mexico. Testing is necessary to have a good estimate of the true size of the epidemic. In Mexico, several hundred Health Units constitute the country\u2019s sentinel surveillance system. Here cases are detected and then a methodology is followed to identify contacts and other relevant information [20]. However, the identification of a suspected case detected by symptomatic surveillance has to be confirmed by testing. Limitations in testing correlate with a higher number of confirmed cases [21]. The positivity test rate in Mexico was around 20% on April [22], comparable to that of the US [21]. This high rate may mislead conclusions on the true growth rate of the epidemic and, in particular, on the date where the maximum incidence is expected.",

The voluntary stay-at-home strategy in effect at the time of writing, requires a level of awareness and behavioral change that take time to become established in the population. Behavioral change is one of the main public health control mechanisms for reducing effective contact rates (in the form of so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions [6]). However, when dealing with behavioral issues, we enter into the psychological realm of individuals and groups of individuals. In our simulations we assume that education or awareness and rational decisions regarding the behavioral change associated with reducing effective contact rates is the same for asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, although there is some evidence that this might not be the case as one can directly witness in the street of large metropolitan areas like Mexico City. We find that there exists a trade-off between the percentage of the population put into SEM (q) and the average time an individual is committed to all the behavioral requirements of effective social distancing (\u03c9). This trade-off generates and optimum value of q, not necessarily very high, that minimizes maximum incidence. Parameter \u03c9 can be thought of as a \u201cleak rate\u201d. The reason behind the existence of an optimal rate q that minimizes the maximum COVID-19 incidence is as follows. When q is small, there is a large quantity of individuals outside SEM. Therefore, the net flux of individuals leaking from the population complying with SEM, is relatively small and does not affect the positive effect of q which is to reduce the effective contact rate and therefore the incidence. However, as more people adhere to SEM protocols, the net flux of leaked individuals becomes more important until we reach a point where the negative effect of abandoning safe social-distancing and behavioral practices counter-balances the beneficial effect of SEM. Recall that, in our model, the population outside SEM has a higher effective contact rate even though they also reduce it when the government indicative is announced. On the other hand we assume that before March 23rd, 2020, the epidemic follows the standard Kermack-McKendrick model and therefore both contact rates (for asymptomatically and symptomatically infected individuals) are constant. After March 23rd, 2020, social-distancing measures are implemented with the aim of reducing these two original contact rates. We model this by assuming that there is 1) a target effective contact rate reduction (modeled by the proportions \u03b1i for each subpopulation), and 2) a time during which awareness develops implying a paulatine but decreasing contact rate over time. Since reducing the effective contact rate is a demand on a behavioral trait, we assume it is not automatic, that it takes time.",

Under this conditions, assuming that the educational/promotional efforts of the government to enforce the non-pharmaceutical interventions are effective for at least 6 months after the implementation of SEM (1\u2215\u03c9=200 days), we show that the scenario with the optimal q=0.7, when maximum incidence is minimized (Fig. A.10), coincides with the projection of having maximum incidence in middle to late May, 2020 made by the Secretary of Health [16]. However, our model shows that the incidence peak date is rather sensitive to changes in the values of q and \u03c9. In summary our model is looking only at the scenario where SEM is maintained. Our model exploration finishes in late August. It is expected that (a gradual) lifting of SEM restrictions will start on the first week of June. However, this fact may change in the following weeks since incidence and deaths are increasing quickly at present.",

A recent model by [24] has explored in great detail the impact of several non-pharmaceutical interventions that our work confirms. Adherence to strict social-distancing is reported there as of utmost importance to control and mitigate the pandemic. In [24] the very important role of face-masks in the containment and mitigation of COVID-19 is demonstrated. These authors find that the efficacious face-mask use (high compliance) can lead, in combination with other intervention strategies, to the eradication of COVID-19. This effect is confirmed in our model through the interplay of two parameters, q, the fraction of the population that follows the protocols of the SEM implemented by the Mexican government, and \u03c9 the leak (or escape) rate of individuals from the adherence to SEM. We have found that there exist a balance between these two parameters to achieve a minimum (or optimal) incidence peak. In Mexico, the mitigation strategy is showing signs of reducing the effective contact rate, which is reflected in the average instantaneous reproduction number holding slightly above 1 since March 23rd, 2020 without significant increase (Fig. A.11). Finally, we underline the need of timely interventions accompanied by an efficient public awareness campaign to reduce \u03c9 together with a well managed and controlled implantation of SEM protocols to maintain a high q and a low target effective reproduction numbers, are all important factors for a successful control and mitigation of the epidemic curve. As our simulations indicate, assuming compliance with SEM with high q and a low abandonment rate \u03c9, the most likely dates for maximum incidence are late May and early June, 2020 (Fig. A.4b, Fig. A.8b). According to our results, alternative scenarios for the maximum incidence being reached in early May, 2020 are improbable.",
