The current gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection is a SARS-CoV-2\u2013specific, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) testing from a nasal or pharyngeal swab, sputum or broncoalveolar lavage.7\n,\n8 Following standard protocols, RNA needs to be extracted and the presence of viral RNA confirmed by RT-qPCR. This requires several potentially erroneous steps and several hours for sampling and evaluation. Even high-throughput laboratories require a minimum of 3\u20134 h from sampling to evaluation, and final information of the infection status may take up to 24 h. This bears the risk of a potential further spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the meantime and hinders widespread testing of all potential contacts. There is currently no rapid method to detect potentially SARS-CoV-2\u2013positive individuals that would allow an assessment of their infection status in a reliable manner.",

There are two detection bands (T1 = IgM and T2 = IgG) on the test strip, which are coated with mouse anti-human IgM and IgG antibodies, respectively. The control band (C) is coated with a goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. After discarding the first drop of blood from a fingertip prick, two drops of blood are applied onto the rapid test chip. In addition, two drops of a provided solution are added. The test indicates positivity for IgG after 15 min and for IgM after 20 min. When a test sample is added to the sample-loading area, the antigen forms an immune conjugate with the gold-labelled antibodies and then move to the detection zone by a capillary action. The negative conformity rate has been described to be 100% for 68 negative controls. The positive conformity rate has been described to be 70% at early stages of infection (day 4\u201310) and 100% at late stages of infection (day 11\u201324).",

The manufacturer recommends to classify weak responses as positive which was supported via receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. Therefore, we defined 11 tests as positive in our study.

High transmission rates and the vast majority presenting with only mild to moderate unspecific symptoms complicate the ability to contain the virus.9 Moreover, laboratory methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection rely on RT-qPCR testing that require longer time for sample handling, preparation and diagnosis. While rapid point-of-care testing is critically needed, the current evaluation of an antibody-based system demonstrates only low sensitivity and is therefore not recommendable to detect potential infections as a stand-alone test. Indeed, studies demonstrated that seroconversion occurred sequentially for IgM and then IgG with a median time of 11 and 14 days, respectively. The presence of antibodies was <40% among patients in the first 7 days of illness and then rapidly increased to 100% at day 15 after onset of symptoms, which appear to be too late from a public health perspective.10\n",
