A prompt initiation of sufficient, appropriate and empiric antibiotics is critical for the treatment of sepsis and septic shock [3, 4]. Imipenem, a carbapenem antibiotic, is one of the most important antibiotics used to cover of a wide spectrum of pathogens, including gram-positive, gram-negative, aerobic, anaerobic and multidrug-resistant strains [5]. Imipenem exhibits time-dependent bactericidal activity, and the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameter that best predicts in vivo antimicrobial activity is %T > minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), defined as the percentage of time during which the plasma concentration remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration of pathogens [6, 7]. However, in the clinical setting of sepsis and septic shock, not only substantial pathophysical changes, but also different infusion regimens significantly alter the antimicrobial PK/PD index [8, 9]. Thus, this may affect clinical outcome. Hence, the 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines reinforced that antibiotic regimens should be optimized based on the PK/PD principle in patients with sepsis and septic shock [2].",

            "text": "The optimal infusion regimen of imipenem in patients with sepsis and septic shock remains undetermined. Early studies in healthy volunteers have demonstrated that carbapenems administered by continuous infusion improved the blood concentrations above MIC compared with intermittent infusion regimens [10]. In critical patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), continuous infusion was correlated with better clinical efficacy compared with intermittent infusion [11]. However, the practical application of carbapenems in continuous infusion mode remains challenging because of its inherent stability issue [12]. A 3-h infusion, instead of continuous infusion, was thereby developed because of its feasibility and superiority [13]. Evidence has revealed that the 3-h infusion results in greater T > MICs than those after a bolus injection in patients with VAP [13]. A 3-h infusion of imipenem may improve the cumulative probability of target attainment (PTA) for various microorganisms compared with a 30-min infusion [14]. Recently, with the use of an in vitro pharmacodynamic model and the Monte Carlo simulation, the optimized two-step infusion therapy (rapid first-step infusion and slow second-step infusion) of meropenem has been proven to have better initial bactericidal effects than a prolonged infusion therapy due to the sufficient %T > MIC and Cmax, with a shorter Tmax [15]. However, whether the two-step infusion regimen of imipenem elicits a greater T > MIC than the conventional extended infusion method, especially in critical patients, is still unknown.",

This result was partly in line with that observed in studies on meropenem. A previous in vitro study revealed that the PTA of the two-step infusion of meropenem completed within 2 h was not apparently superior to those with a prolonged 2-h infusion. However, the difference on PTA increased when infusion time was prolonged to 4\u20136 h [15]. Notably, this study was based on the in vitro pharmacodynamics model, which only targeted Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the present study was a real-world exploratory study conducted in critical patients with various pathogens. In addition, an infusion that lasted no longer than 2 h was designed in the present study because of the consideration of stability and clinical feasibility. Therefore, comments on the efficacy of the two-step infusion regimen fulfilled in a longer duration could not be made.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that the total CL and Vd of imipenem markedly fluctuated in critically ill patients compared with normal volunteer populations [19]. For patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, the values of both Vd and CL of imipenem in the present study appeared to be higher than those observed in healthy volunteers, but these were similar to those in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia [19, 20]. The explanation for the pharmacokinetic alteration is that pathophysical changes during septic conditions compromise the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs. On one hand, decreased cardiac output and microcirculation shield the microcirculatory distribution of drugs. On the other hand, the increase in capillary permeability and interstitial edema may enhance drug distribution. Furthermore, the underlying impaired hepatic and renal function also affect the metabolism and clearance of drugs [21].",

In the present study, the percentage of cases achieving targets of 40% T > MIC was nearly 100% at an MIC of 1\u20134 \u03bcg/ml, regardless of whether imipenem was administered with 0.5 g q6h or 1.0 g q8h. However, when MIC was increased to 8 \u03bcg/ml, the percentage of patients reaching 40% T > MIC was only 11\u201330% at a dose of 0.5 g q6h and 80\u2013100% at a dose of 1.0 g q8h. Previous studies on pneumonia have reported a high PTA (40% T > MIC) at an MIC of 1\u20132 \u03bcg/ml when imipenem was used at a dose of 1.0 g q8h or 0.5 g q6h [20, 22]. However, imipenem at 1.0 g q8h or 1.0 g q6h was required for pathogens with a higher MIC in critically ill patients [23]. It is thereby recommended that a maximum imipenem dose of 1.0 g q6h should be considered for treating less susceptible pathogens in patients with sepsis and septic shock. However, further large-scale studies are still needed to confirm this statement. In addition, susceptibility in different pathogenic species should be considered. In the present study, almost all regimens achieved 40% T > MIC against Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, while only a small proportion of imipenem therapies achieved targets against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., because most of the isolates from the present study revealed that MIC was higher than the resistant breakpoints (data not shown).",

Second, the study was not double-dummy for blind randomization, which may have produced biased results. Third, sepsis and septic shock are actually a disease syndrome that refers to a variety of underlying diseases and pathogens. Furthermore, patient heterogeneity may have affected the results. Fourth, the clinical efficacy of both regimens was not compared because the ultimate outcome would be affected by multiple factors other than antibiotics. Fifth, although previous studies have demonstrated that 40% T > MIC is associated with the optimal activity for imipenem, recent studies have suggested that a target of 100% T > MIC might be more appropriate for critically ill patients with severe sepsis [24]. However, the issue of whether the two-step infusion mode is better than the extended infusion mode has been well validated, even when 40% T > MIC was applied as the target of the present study. Finally, we did not analyze the infection outcome because the aim of this study was to explore the pharmacokinetics of imipenem and we speculate that the infection outcome would be affected by multiple confounding factors during a longer observation period. The comparison of PK data between patients with positive and negative microbiology was performed, and the results are shown in Supplemental Table 1, which revealed that there were no significant differences in PK data between the two groups except that CL in the two step (0.5 g q6h) differed slightly, possibly because of the limited sample size. It is also noticeable that analysis was infeasible in the other two groups because of the limited sample size.
