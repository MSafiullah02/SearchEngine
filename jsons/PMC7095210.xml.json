Maternal mortality in India is 440 per 100,000 deliveries compared to 12 per 100,000 deliveries in the United States and 6 in Canada [4]. Although obstetric patients form a significant proportion of ICU admissions in developing countries [5, 6], there are only a very few studies from these countries reporting on critical illness in pregnancy [7, 8, 9], and none comparing the acute disorders leading to critical illness in obstetric patients with those in economically developed countries. Besides case mix, ethnicity and differences in health care system may affect the spectrum of life-threatening obstetric and medical disorders seen in pregnancy. International comparisons can also identify treatments which may result in improved maternal or fetal outcome. We therefore studied obstetric patients admitted to the medical ICU of an Indian public hospital with those admitted to a county hospital in the U.S.",

The reason for ICU admission was classified into obstetric, if it was a direct consequence of the pregnant or postpartum state (e.g., placenta previa, pre-eclampsia, postpartum hemorrhage), and medical, if it could have occurred even in a non-pregnant state (e.g., pyelonephritis, deep vein thrombosis, auto-immune disorders). Organ dysfunction was assessed daily using the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS) criteria [16]. The MODS criteria assess respiratory dysfunction using the ratio of arterial pO2/fraction of inspired oxygen, renal dysfunction by the serum creatinine level, hepatic dysfunction by serum bilirubin level, neurological dysfunction by the Glasgow coma scale, hematological dysfunction by the platelet count, and cardiovascular dysfunction by arterial blood pressure and heart rate [16].

Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, antepartum hemorrhage due to placental abruption and placenta previa, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, amniotic fluid embolism, postpartum hemorrhage, and uterine rupture were equally common in both groups; however, HELLP syndrome occurred more often in American patients (17.8 vs 5.6% in KEMH patients).

The reasons for this difference are not clear. Abnormalities of placental adherence leading to postpartum hemorrhage too were common in BTGH patients, probably because more of these women had had Caesarean section in previous pregnancies [4].",

Urinary tract infections are more common and also more severe in pregnancy because of vesicoureteric reflux due to pressure on the urinary bladder by the gravid uterus and dilatation of the ureters secondary to the effect of progesterone [18]; however, complicated urinary tract infection was rare in Indian patients (0.3%). Sexual intercourse has been shown to increase risk of urinary infection five to tenfold and is implicated as the most important factor in the pathogenesis of urinary infection in young women [19]. Indian women traditionally stay with their mothers during the latter half of pregnancy, away from their husbands. The resulting abstinence from sexual intercourse could explain the lower incidence of urosepsis in the Indian patients. This can also explain why 12.6% of BTGH patients had sepsis due to chorioamnionitis compared with 0.9% of KEMH patients. Sexual intercourse is also an important cause of bacterial vaginosis and premature rupture of membranes, both of which are risk factors for chorioamnionitis [20].",

Acute viral hepatitis, especially due to water-borne hepatitis A and E viruses, is common in India [23, 24].

Central nervous system dysfunction was common in Indian ICU patients in whom eclampsia, cerebral malaria, CNS infections, hepatic coma, and cerebral venous thrombosis were major causes. Renal failure too was more frequent in Indian patients due to a combination of pre-eclampsia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, postpartum hemorrhage, and shock. Severe malaria, leptospirosis, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy too were important causes of renal failure. Hematological dysfunction was the commonest organ affected in the American ICU patients followed by respiratory failure. Bacterial sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation due to obstetric disorders were responsible for most cases of hematological failure, and community-acquired pneumonia, acute asthma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to abdominal sepsis were the common causes of respiratory failure. Cardiovascular failure, mainly due to obstetric hemorrhage, or cardiogenic shock in rheumatic heart disease was more common in Indian patients. Hepatic dysfunction was equally common in the two groups, but the causes differed: acute viral hepatitis in Indian patients was balanced by the higher incidence of HELLP syndrome in American patients. Differences in the use of ICU resources in the two ICUs closely matched the pattern of organ affection.

Several reasons could explain this difference. Only 27% of Indian women (vs 86% of American women) had attended prenatal clinics; mortality in patients who received regular prenatal care was significantly lower than patients who had not. While non-availability of health care services may be an important issue in rural India, this is definitely not the case in Mumbai. Free prenatal services are available at state-funded centers, but long queues and wait times limit their use. Private health care is expensive and cost of regular prenatal visits is prohibitive [4, 31]. Some patients do not seek medical attention during pregnancy because of social misconceptions and up to 40% of deliveries in rural India take place at home, unsupervised by medical personnel [31]. The high number of Indian women with pre-eclampsia manifesting with seizures is a clear reflection of their non-utilization of prenatal care services, as is the interval between onset of acute illness and hospital admission. This also explains higher APACHE II scores, greater incidence of cardiac arrest prior to hospital admission, and high rate of intrauterine fetal death in Indian women.",

In many obstetric disorders including severe pre-eclampsia, prolonged intra-uterine fetal death and acute fatty liver of pregnancy, early delivery can be lifesaving by preventing complications such as seizures, DIC, hepatic encephalopathy, and renal failure [32, 33]. Removing the fetus from the compromised uterine environment also improves fetal outcome [32, 33]. Neonatology services are restricted to only a handful of centers in India, even in large cities. Given the likelihood of poor fetal survival if delivered prematurely, pregnant women and their families decline early elective delivery at a stage when the illness can be managed in primary or secondary care centers. It is therefore not surprising that induction of labor was performed in only 26.7% of Indian women (vs 38% in BTGH patients) and cesarean section in 16% (vs 78% in BTGH patients). This aggressive obstetric approach and better neonatology facilities may have accounted for the low maternal and fetal mortality in the BTGH patients; however, surgical intervention in patients with shock, severe organ dysfunction, and coagulopathy increase the risk of complications, especially hemorrhage and postoperative abdominal and pelvic sepsis [34]. This explains the greater need for transfusion of packed red cells and blood products and higher incidence of puerperal sepsis in BTGH patients. Nevertheless, the far superior maternal and fetal outcomes prove that this approach is fully justified, despite the complications.",

This study also shows how medical and obstetric disorders and their outcomes are affected by social customs, traditions, economics, and patterns of endemic infections. Besides possible differences in quality of ICU care, the main factor contributing to better maternal and fetal outcome in the BTGH cohort is probably the aggressive and timely obstetric intervention. Attention to many of these issues is needed to reduce maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity in developing countries such as India.",
