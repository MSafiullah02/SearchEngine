The virus belongs to the genus Gammacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales\n[2]. IBV poses a major economic threat worldwide, especially due to reduced egg quality and quantity in layer chickens and predisposition to bacterial infections in broilers. IBV initially targets the epithelium of the respiratory tract, but depending on the viral strain it can also infect other organs, mostly the reproductive tract and the kidneys. New IBV variants, resulting in different genotypes, serotypes and pathotypes, are continuously reported [3].",

For histopathological examination, tissue slides of trachea and kidney were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE) according to standard laboratory procedures. Histopathologic changes were critically evaluated via light microscopy by two veterinary pathologists, who after individual evaluation came to a consensus. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on tissue slides as previously described by van Beurden et al. (2017) [16], using a monoclonal antibody directed against the IBV S2 protein (Prionics-Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Percentages of cells showing viral protein expression were scored for each organ by light microscopic evaluation, similarly as described by van den Brand et al. (2011) [17]. For the trachea, this was done with the total piece of tissue divided into ten parts; in each tenth, the percentage of cells showing viral protein expression was defined in 10% increments. An average viral protein expression percentage for the total trachea was then calculated by dividing the total sum of the ten separate percentages by ten. For the kidney and cloaca, similar procedures were followed, but, due to the more variable tissue sample shape, each tissue piece was divided into five instead of ten parts for technical convenience. The GI tract was evaluated for presence of viral protein expression without percentage-wise scoring and with division of the total GI tract into four parts: (1) stomachs (proventriculus and gizzard), (2) small intestines (duodenum, jejunum, ileum), (3) large intestines (caeca, large intestinal segment connecting ileocaecal junction with cloaca) and (4) cloaca.",

Since the 1960s, viremia has been proposed as one of the routes of IBV dissemination [18], with only recent evidence for involvement of mononuclear cells in transportation of the virus throughout the body [19], [20]. In our study, mononuclear cells expressing viral proteins were only rarely detected (data not shown), so it is yet unclear whether they truly contribute to IBV dissemination. In addition, virions excreted by coughing, sneezing and rales, or taken up by ingestion, can contribute to the dissemination of the virus to other organs [1]. Our observation that comparable viral RNA levels for the virulent and vaccine strains were produced in the trachea, while lower or delayed viral RNA levels for the vaccine strain were detected in the cloaca and conjunctivae, suggests that the vaccine has a lower ability to reach or to infect these tissues. It is possible, however, that part of the viral RNA came from non-infectious viral particles, as the infectious dose produced was not determined in this study. The extent to which viral shedding from the trachea contributes to the lower viral RNA titres in the conjunctivae and cloaca remains to be confirmed. Other factors, including stability of the virus in various environmental conditions, susceptibility to immune factors, or intrinsic differences between the viruses to replicate in tissues distant from the initial site of infection may play an additional role in reduced replication in secondary organs.",

This is in accordance with a previous study in which passages of a QX virulent strain in embryonated eggs showed a progressive reduction in ability to replicate in the kidneys of experimentally infected chickens [14]. Kidney lesions induced by D388 did not, however, result in clinical symptoms usually observed in cases of nephritis [9], [21], [22]. Clinical respiratory symptoms in both groups were mild, but comparable (not shown). As the severity of IBV clinical symptoms also relies on environmental factors, including but not limited to cold and heat stress, food additives and the presence of secondary bacterial or viral infections [22], the severity of clinical symptoms in an experimental setting is often less than in the field [23], [24].",

This seems to be supported by the observation that epithelial cells of the distal tubules, collecting ducts and ureter commonly tend to show the only or more prominent viral protein expression, compared to the proximal nephron segments. Comparable observations supporting this theory were made in other studies [24], [25], [26]. The cloaca at least seems to be reached by the virus by a descending route via the gastrointestinal tract, likely after swallowing viral particles. Alternatively, the virus might reach the cloaca via an ascending process called cloacal suckling, with uptake of particles from the environment into the cloaca [27] after their excretion from, for example, airways or eyes. From this study, however, it is not clear whether such cloacal uptake of virus takes place.",
