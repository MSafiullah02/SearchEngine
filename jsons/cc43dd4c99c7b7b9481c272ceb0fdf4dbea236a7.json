Recruitment of sufficient participants is among the most significant challenges for many studies. The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has further changed and challenged the landscape for clinical trial execution, including screening and randomization. The Investigating Gains in Neurocognition in an Intervention Trial of Exercise (IGNITE) study has been designed as the most comprehensive test of aerobic exercise effects on cognition and brain health. Here we assess recruitment into IGNITE prior to the increased infection rates in the United States, and examine new challenges and opportunities for recruitment with a goal of informing the remaining required recruitment as infection containment procedures are lifted. The results may assist the design and implementation of recruitment for future exercise studies, and outline opportunities for study design that are flexible in the face of emerging threats.",

            "text": "Many countries around the world, including the United States, are experiencing a rapid demographic shift, with greater numbers of individuals living longer. [1] Associated with increased life expectancy is an increase in health care costs and risk of chronic and debilitating age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The rising number of individuals at risk for cognitive decline is accelerating efforts to develop effective treatment and prevention approaches as policy makers, clinical researchers, drug developers, and other stakeholders fully recognize the scope of the problem. Exercise is a promising approach for improving brain and cognitive health in late adulthood [2] [3] [4] [5] but the field still lacks definitive evidence of benefit. [6] Our Phase III multi-site randomized dose-response clinical trial called IGNITE (NCT02875301) has been designed to definitively address whether exercise impacts cognitive and brain health in cognitively normal older adults. [7] Clinically definitive trials generally require large sample sizes (e.g., >500) to evaluate the primary outcome of interest. Efficiently and effectively recruiting adequate numbers of qualified volunteer participants is among the biggest challenges facing cognitive aging investigators. [8] Nearly 20% of trials fail to adequately recruit the number of participants necessary to address their clinical question. [9] Trial recruitment is commonly cited as being among the most costly barriers to advancing our understanding of cognitive health interventions [8, 10, 11] and requires significant investment of money, institutional resources, time, and personnel. [12] The pace of recruitment into trials directly impacts the cost of trials and their time to completion. [10, 13] In late December 2019, the novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) was first reported. By late February of 2020, United States municipalities began applying a variety of infection containment policies such as social distancing and non-essential business closures to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. These policies significantly impacted clinical research activities and recruitment into most clinical research across the United States, [16] including IGNITE. All IGNITE sites temporarily halted enrollment and in-person study activities consistent with institutional guidance. Recognizing that recruitment and study procedures would likely be altered for the remainder of the trial timeline, the IGNITE team undertook an assessment of trial recruitment up to the SARS-CoV-2 closures, to assess (a) lessons learned regarding multi-site exercise trial recruitment with respect to demographics (especially underrepresented ethno-racial minorities, URM) and study procedures, and (b) potential new recruitment barriers and opportunities after containment policies were eased. The goal of the analysis was descriptive in nature, rather than driven by a priori hypotheses. Expected outcomes were identified barriers and opportunities to enrollment post SARS-CoV-2 onset applicable to large-scale exercise trials for healthy, sedentary older adults.",

(2) At that dose, does exercise influence brain structure and/or function? (3) Is there a dose-response effect of exercise on cognitive performance or brain structure/function, such that exercise that exceeds the recommended levels of 150 min/week results in even greater benefits in cognitive and brain health? (4) Can we identify possible mechanisms (e.g., cardiometabolic, inflammatory, neurotrophic, or psychosocial changes) by which exercise influences cognitive and brain health? (5) Are there factors (e.g., were conducted by each site through a central database (REDCap [17] ) custom designed by the University of Pittsburgh coordinating center. The phone screening form contained standard screening language employed by all sites. Inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in Table   1 . The script began with a description of the study design, and then study procedures, and request for verbal consent for data collection to determine eligibility. This was followed by demographic information collection, eligibility criteria confirmation most likely to exclude an individual, and finally the Telephone Inventory of Cognitive Status. [18] The phone screen was built with dependency logic that was self-terminating, such that a phone screen would end if any exclusionary criteria were identified at any point, or if the participant declined for any reason, prior to completing the full screen. Therefore, not all demographic, inclusion or exclusion criteria, or medical conditions were captured for each potential participant, resulting in a sparse data set.",

The total recruitment cost to date has been $276,596, with an average perrandomization cost of $590.43. Due to a variety of strategies employed, per-person randomization costs varied across sites, largely owing to different labor costs associated with recruitment; an estimated $199,187 were spent on staff time in recruitment. The estimated number of hours per randomization was 1.16, highlighting the need for dedicated recruitment staff in large-scale trials with high screening throughput.",

We found that direct advocacy approaches, such as a study team member making a community presentation or an individual advocating for participation provided the greatest number of individuals who met inclusion criteria and were ultimately randomized.

The IGNITE study team has worked to increase URM participation. However, not all sites have achieved high levels of URM representation. There are several possible reasons for this representation issue. Prior work has reported on the importance of long-standing relationships on the part of investigators and institutions to increase URM participation.[23] Each IGNITE site is in different stages of establishing relationships with URM communities. For example, the University of Kansas study team has established community partnership that are relatively new (<5 years) whereas the University of Pittsburgh study team has long-standing relationships and URM-dedicated RCTs ongoing. The Center for Cognitive and Brain Health atNortheastern was established two years ago and therefore is still building community partnerships. Approaches to expanding inclusion of underrepresented communities and men in research on aging and exercise need to be culturally tailored, responsive, and appropriate.",
