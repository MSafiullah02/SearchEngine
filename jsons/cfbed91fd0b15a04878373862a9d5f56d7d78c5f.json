This response is facilitated by discriminatory activation of CD4 + helper and CD8 + killer T cells, accompanied by little to no activation of regulatory T cells (Gandhi, Laroni, & Weiner, 2010) . As a result, inflammation is an alternate characteristic symptom of MS. T lymphocytes and activated macrophages infiltrate the brain and with the aid of activated microglia, induce immunological activation, leading to progressive myelin destruction (Kasper & Shoemaker, 2010) . Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) also allows immune cells to enter the brain, where T lymphocytes attack the myelin sheath (Compston & Coles, 2002) . This triggers a subsequent inflammatory cascade, leading to the secretion of cytokines, including interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and interleukin (IL)-17, and the production of antibodies by B lymphocytes which can secrete their own cytokines, TNF\u03b1 and Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-\u03b2 (Duddy et al., 2007) . These soluble factors cause further recruitment of immune cells, perpetuating inflammation and damage (Nylander & Hafler, 2012) . In addition, pro-inflammatory Type 1 T helper (Th1) and Th17 cells display direct cytotoxic effects on oligodendrocyte precursor cells and obstruct remyelination (Baxi et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2015) .",

It is through this pathway that VZV trafficks glycoprotein complexes from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the outer cell membrane to release new virus (Buckingham, Jarosinski, Jackson, Carpenter, & Grose, 2016) . Given that low serum transferrin levels have been linked to several chronic diseases, including MS (Zeman et al., 2000) , trafficking of VZV alongside the transferrin receptor would aid in viral assembly, ultimately leading to increased immune activation.",

            "text": "Apart from demyelination, there is also evidence of axonal or neuronal injury in MS that have gained some importance in the MS field. The \"inside-out\" concept of induced demyelination suggests that pathogenic damage occurs at the unmyelinated axon, often in combination with enhanced oligodendrocyte apoptosis (Tsunoda & Fujinami, 2002) . Several viral infections are accompanied by axonal damage like HIV (An et al., 1997) , HSV (Martin, 1984) , and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) (Tsunoda & Fujinami, 2002) , which has also been associated with MS. The pathogenesis of this axonal injury still requires much study. One concept suggests direct immune attack on the axon based upon the presence of antibodies to neurofilament and tubulin in some MS patients (Silber & Sharief, 1999) . Separately, some viruses can be transported through the axons leading to axonal degeneration and dissemination of virus throughout the CNS (Kristensson, 1996) . In TMEV infection, for example, axonal injury precedes demyelination which indicates in some cases demyelination may come secondary to axonal injury (Das Sarma, Kenyon, Hingley, & Shindler, 2009 ). Additionally, as has been discussed, there is also evidence on axonal injury in silent inactive plaques where few axons are degraded at a given point in time but will instead persist for a longer time in the CNS (Lassmann, 2003) . Viral infections causing encephalitis (Morfopoulou et al., 2016) , are also considered as a risk factor in developing MS (Weiss, 1983) . ",

Examples of direct toxic effects from an active infection is JCV which directly causes demyelination after infecting oligodendrocytes, and canine distemper virus which infects astrocytes in white matter leading to demyelination (Chalkias et al., 2014) . Another mechanism underlying demyelination is molecular mimicry, where pathogenic proteins possess homologous amino acid sequences with self-proteins subsequently causing viral induced autoimmunity (Fujinami & Oldstone, 1985) .

HHV-6 is able to enter cells through the CD46 receptor, with viral antigen able to be detected in oligodendrocytes and rarely in astrocytes. However, HHV-6 has been detected in the scar-like plaques on the myelin sheath of MS patients (Reynaud et al., 2013) . Accordingly, IgM antibody against the P41/38 antigen and DNA of HHV-6A was reported in serum from RRMS patients. HHV-6A persists and may reactivate CNS immune cells, leading to higher lymphoproliferative response against HHV6A which has been detected in MS patients.",

Later onset of symptomatic EBV infection is extremely risky (Ascherio & Munger, 2007) . CD4 and CD8 T cells are the primary line of defense against EBV-infection. The association of EBV with MS is supported by numerous case reports where EBV infection was shown to cause axonal demyelination, and detectable EBV antibodies were reported in CSF and meningeal lymphoid follicles (Salvetti, Giovannoni, & Aloisi, 2009; Thacker, Mirzaei, & Ascherio, 2006; Tselis, 2012) . The major EBV antigen in MS cases is EBNA1, with antibodies produced specifically in the CSF compartment forming oligoclonal bands, a characteristic of viral infection in MS. Epitope mapping techniques employed for testing the specificity of oligoclonal IgG showed that MS-specific epitopes are derived from EBNA1 and BRRF2 (EBV lytic gene product) proteins, providing evidence of intrathecal production of EBNA1-specific IgG in MS (Cepok et al., 2005) . Viral capsid antigen (VCA) and the early antigens (EA) are also produced against EBV. Serum antibodies to VCA show more variation and higher seroprevalence than antibodies to EBNA-1. EBV transforms B cells controlled by host immunological control leading to EBV-associated malignancies. During the lytic stage, C-terminus of EBNA1 binds to the episome (circular DNA of EBV) and transmits virus into progenies. Another link between EBV infection and MS corresponds to molecular mimicry for immunodominant myelin resultant motifs on T cells (Libbey & Fujinami, 2010) . Peptides derived from EBV have sequences which are stimulatory for MBP derived CD4 T-cell clones. A cross-reactive T-cell clone detects the MBP peptide similar to the HLA-DR2b and EBV BSLF1 peptide similar to the HLA-DR2a. T cells specific to EBNA1 will provide immunity against EBV, but in MS patients, an EBNA1specific response of T cells is distorted; yielding exacerbated T cell responses throughout infection. Molecular mimicry amongst viral antigens and autoantigens support autoreactive T cells, such as the accumulation of EBNA1-targeting T cells leading to autoimmunity associated with infection. EBV genes in turn excite autoimmune B cells which are also cross-reactive, serving as evidence that EBV has involvement in MS pathogenesis (Compston & Coles, 2008) ( Figure 2 ). | 1837",

Bystander activation involves a wide range of events that occur after viral infection such as production of cytokines and chemokines, expression of host otherwise inactive genes, and the unveiling of blocked self-antigens (Donati & Jacobson, 2002) . The process of epitope spreading implies the introduction of additional epitopes following an initial inflammatory response to one epitope, such as myelin basic protein (Lehmann, Forsthuber, Miller, & Sercarz, 1992) . The mechanism can be explained by self-sustained breakdown of myelin by continuous exposure of epitope during inflammatory reactions. The phenomenon of epitope spreading is well studied in the autoimmune encephalitis and TME models for demyelination induced by viruses.

In EAE, an immune reaction to CNS components is induced in susceptible animals with self-antigens that are derived from myelin protein. This was first described in monkeys stimulated with rabbit antigen (Rivers, Sprunt, & Berry, 1933) , but later Freund's adjuvant (Freund & McDermott, 1942) and pertussis toxin (Munoz, Bernard, & Mackay, 1984) were added to induce a humoral immune reaction similar to as seen in RRMS (Kabat, Wolf, & Bezer, 1947) , and analogous to what is found in MS patients.",

The type of antigen introduced to the animal determined its particular presentation of EAE. Immunization of SJL/J mice with an epitope of proteolipid protein induces RRMS (Tuohy, Lu, Sobel, Laursen, & Lees, 1989) , while MS induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein in C57BL6/J mice is chronic MS (Tompkins et al., 2002) . Apart from EAE models, viral infection models which most effectively aid in the study of EBV related MS are TMEV infection models (Richards et al., 2011; Tsunoda, Iwasaki, Terunuma, Sako, & Ohara, 1996) . Utilizing TMEV models also assist in studying new therapeutic methodologies targeted toward adhesion molecules and axonal degeneration (Tsunoda & Fujinami, 2010) . Independent of introducing immunogens and viruses, certain chemical compounds have been utilized to cause an immune reaction leading to MS-like symptoms, like cuprizone and lysolecithin, which cause oligodendrocyte cell death and have been primarily used to study demyelination and remyelination in MS (Jeffery & Blakemore, 1995; Matsushima & Morell, 2001) .",

Although many correlations have been established between foreign pathogens and MS, there is no evidence for a direct association between any pathogen and the development or progression of MS. It is still unclear, whether bacterial or viral pathogens are capable of initiating MS in susceptible patients and exacerbate MS symptoms. As multiple species of bacteria and virus have been shown to associate with MS, it is possible that the mechanism of this association is a result of generalized inflammation caused by the immune response to these pathogens. The listed pathogens have been reported to cause one or more of the indicated pathways which culminate in the demyelination of neurons and progression of MS. The outlined therapeutic strategies include the existing treatment options as well as the focuses of current research demyelination (McLauchlan & Robertson, 2017) . Therefore, B celldepleting therapy as an alternative to T cell therapy is considered highly effective against relapsing MS, and disability worsening in PPMS. The B cell-depleting therapy is divided into two categories; polyclonal and monoclonal antibody therapies. Polyclonal antibody therapies inhibit cell-mediated immune reactions by causing general immunosuppression, albeit not commonly used in MS due to high toxicity (Walker, Hoehn, & Kashiwagi, 1976) . On the other hand, numerous monoclonal antibodies including Natalizumab, Alemtuzumab and Daclizumab have proven effective in early RRMS (Nguyen, Gresle, Marshall, Butzkueven, & Field, 2017) . In addition, three emerging monoclonal antibodies against CD20-positive B cells (rituximab, ocrelizumab, and ofatumumab) have shown overall promising effects in clinical phase II and III trials (Abbruzzese et al., 1983; Reff et al., 1994; Stashenko, Nadler, Hardy, & Schlossman, 1980) .",

HLA changes are responsible for approximately 20%-60% of genetic predisposition (International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics et al., 2011), and around 110 polymorphisms found in discrete loci outside the MHC gene are associated with the susceptibility to MS (Sawcer, Franklin, & Ban, 2014). According to a Genome-wide association study, susceptibility to MS has been linked mainly to the HLA-DRB1 locus class II region of the MHC, with the HLA-DR15 (DRB1*1501-DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602-DRB5*0101) haplotypes dominating MS risk in Caucasians and HLA-DRB1*15:01 associated with MS risk in African Americans and northern Han Chinese populations (Compston & Coles, 2008). Additional alleles within the MHC locus have been associated to MS including the HLA-DRB1*03:01, HLA-DRB1*13:03, HLA-DPB1*03:01 and HLA-A*02:01, while HLA-C554 and HLA-DRB1*11 are believed to be protective against the disease (International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics et al., 2011). Polymorphisms in non-HLA genes associated to MS include the interleukin 2 (IL2) receptor alpha (IL2RA) and interleukin 7 (IL7) receptor alpha (IL7RA) loci expressed on regulatory T cells, important for proliferation and survival of T-and B cells, and increase the vulnerability of developing MS",

Presence of 1,25-dihy-droxyvitamin D3 (1\u03b1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 ) modulates the expression of MHC II-complexed antigens on the surface of immune cells, inhibits the production of Type 2 helper T cell cytokines, and affects T-and B cell proliferation and antibody secretion (Aranow, 2011; van Etten & Mathieu, 2005). The International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC) and Welcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2) reported that the genes encoding the Cytochrome P450 Family 27 Subfamily B Member 1 (CYP27B1) enzyme for vitamin D production and Cytochrome P450 Family 24 Subfamily A Member 1 (CYP24A1) enzyme which degrades 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D contribute to MS progression by lowering the levels of active vitamin D. Moreover, RNA expression levels of the MS susceptibility gene, HLA-DRB1*15:01 are controlled by vitamin D levels (International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics et al., 2011).",
