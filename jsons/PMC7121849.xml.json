Acute exacerbations are often devastating with a median survival of usually about 4 months [8]. If an IPF patient requires mechanical ventilation, mortality has been reported to be 78\u201386% [9, 10]. Some authors have proposed that mechanical ventilation in IPF patients is futile and these patients should not receive this intervention [11, 12]. Others have argued, and shown, that even short-term survival allows a window for pulmonary transplantation [10]. Additionally, it is noted that mortality is not absolute, and thus not \u201cfutile\u201d in all cases. Due to the poor prognosis, an accurate diagnosis of AE-IPF is of utmost importance to exclude reversible causes; however, this is often challenging.",

However diagnosis and management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is usually the realm of the pulmonologist. Ensuring that the patient has an accurate diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is critical to determining prognosis for the underlying condition. Fibrotic lung disease associated with collagen-vascular disease, such as polymyositis, has also been associated with acute exacerbations, and may have a better prognosis [15]. Many pulmonologists who are less familiar with interstitial lung diseases often incorrectly attribute all types of lung fibrosis to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [16]. Given the disparate outcomes, accurate discrimination of IPF from other fibrotic lung diseases is critical. Clues on CT scan suggesting the diagnosis of IPF are basal, subpleural predominance of interlobular septal thickening with honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis (see Fig. 30.1) [13]. In the absence of AE-IPF, evidence of extensive ground glass infiltrates and nodules on CT imaging typically argues against IPF [13]. Clinical findings should include a conspicuous absence of inhalational exposures and rheumatologic conditions. \u201cVelcro\u201d rales are typically present on physical exam.",

Additionally, patients with IPF are at higher risk of lung cancer which may require surgical treatment. Thoracic surgery for lung cancer resection or surgical lung biopsy can precipitate an acute exacerbation of IPF [17\u201320]. Interestingly the insult is often radiologically worse in the nonoperative lung [19]. This is theorized to be due to the ventilator-associated lung injury from excessive stretch from single lung ventilation during the operation to de-gas the operative lung. Some have suggested restrictive intraoperative fluid management may minimize post-operative AE-IPF risk, but this has not been prospectively validated [17]. AE-IPF after non-pulmonary operation has been reported, but rarely [21].",
