For example, a sudden increase and high prevalence of the GII.17 strain in Asian countries occurred between 2014 and 2015,28, 29, 30 although the same high prevalence of this strain was not reflected in other parts of the world, with lower levels detected in Australasia, Europe, and North America compared to the Asian outbreaks during that same period.31, 32, 33\n",

The genome has three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes a polyprotein that is posttranslationally cleaved into seven nonstructural proteins (p48 [NS1/2], NTPase [NS3], p22 [NS4], VPg (NS5], a viral protease [Pro, 3C\u2010like, NS6], and a viral RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp, NS7]), by the virus\u2010encoded 3C\u2010like cysteine protease (3CLpro) (Figure 1) (reviewed in Atmar34; Karst35; Karst et al36). ORF2 and ORF3 encode the proteins VP1 and VP2, respectively; VP1 is the major capsid protein and VP2 is the minor capsid protein, likely involved in capsid assembly and genome encapsidation.37 The VP1 protein structure comprises the shell (S) and protruding (P) domains; the S domain encloses the viral RNA, while the antigenically variable P domain forms the outer surface of VP1, and is also involved in cell attachment.38, 39 The VP1 protein can be expressed in baculovirus which then self\u2010assembles into virus\u2010like particles (VLPs). These VLPs are antigenically and structurally indistinguishable to virions produced by the complete virus.40\n",

The HCV replicons typically yield more than 1 \u00d7 104 copies per cell (AA Eltahla, 2018 personal communication), and have been used to identify many successful antiviral candidates. Moreover, they are amenable to high\u2010throughput antiviral screening (reviewed in Horscroft et al45), which has directly led to many of the direct\u2010acting antivirals (DAAs) used to treat HCV infections today (reviewed in Asselah et al46).",
