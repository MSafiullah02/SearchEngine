Although the estimates are variable, there is consistent evidence that the prevalence and incidence of LTBI in health care workers is substantially higher than the general population, in all settings. In high-income countries the pooled risk of TB disease among workers is only twice that of the general population, whereas the risk of infection is 10 times higher. In low-income countries disease and infection are about 5-fold higher than the general population. The reason for the difference in relative risk between infection and disease in high-income countries may reflect the healthy worker effect53 or may reflect overestimation of LTBI because of the nonspecificity of tuberculin skin testing in BCG-vaccinated populations.",

Most of these risk factors can be interpreted to indicate simply that infection and disease are proportionate to likelihood of exposure to patients with TB. It is self-evident that more years of work, in jobs that involve direct patient care, and in hospitals or units caring for more patients with TB, are more likely to result in TB infection and disease. One useful indicator is the number of patients with TB per worker,3, 5 because the same number of patients with TB inevitably creates greater probability of exposure if cared for by a small group of workers, than the per-worker exposure risk in a larger hospital. Other risk factors relate to increased chance of exposure to undiagnosed patients; these include work in emergency departments, or HIV services (the latter because of the atypical clinical manifestations of TB in HIV-coinfected patients). The third category of risk factor relates to specific activities that increase patients' contagiousness. For example, respiratory therapists,52, 92 and pathology workers2, 90, 93 have been consistently identified as high-risk workers, because certain of their tasks can result in aerosolization of TB bacilli (eg, intubation,94, 95 sputum induction,96, 97 bronchoscopy,98 or autopsy99, 100).",

The consistent observation that risk is proportional to the number of patients with TB per worker has resulted in risk-stratified recommendations: large hospitals with few patients with TB are required to implement fewer measures to prevent nosocomial TB transmission than hospitals with more TB cases. The knowledge that workers in high-incidence countries have 5 times greater risk of infection and disease than the general population has led to the realization that TB is the most common and serious occupational illness in these countries. This finding has stimulated concerted efforts to raise awareness, not least among the workers themselves, many of whom have a stoic and fatalistic approach to occupational TB.

These controls include rapid triage of patients suspected of active TB, rapid performance of chest radiographs or other screening tests, expeditious processing of sputum samples for acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear and culture, and more rapid separation of patients with TB (usually in isolation rooms). Personal controls are measures directed at individual workers. These measures include use of personal respirators (masks) and screening for, and treatment of, latent or active TB. Engineering controls are environmental measures that act to reduce the likelihood of workers' exposure to viable airborne TB bacilli. These controls include ventilation to remove and/or dilute airborne bacilli, and to ensure correct direction of flow of contaminated air, and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), which kills airborne bacilli.",

These efforts resulted in a modest decline in overall TB incidence, which was not statistically significant. However, compliance with these measures was suboptimal. In Thailand, 1202 health care workers had serial tuberculin testing before and after administrative, personal, and engineering measures were instituted in one provincial referral hospital. Incidence of LTBI declined substantially but incidence of disease increased.47 However, the increase in disease may have been a result of a concomitant increase in HIV prevalence, and because the number of patients with TB almost doubled at the same time. In 2 Brazilian hospitals incidence of TST conversion was 8 per 1000 person-months following implementation of the full hierarchy of administrative, personal, and engineering controls, compared with 16 per 1000 person-months in 2 other hospitals without any TB infection-control measures.45\n",

In one Italian hospital, the occurrence of new MDR disease among patients was eliminated after implementation of administrative measures alone.108 In a US hospital TST conversion was reduced 80% by administrative measures alone.109 In the Malawi study most of the changes were administrative; these had minimal effect, but as noted earlier, compliance with the measures was poor.65 In 2 US hospitals administrative measures were introduced first, and interim tuberculin testing was performed before implementation of the rest of the infection control measures. In both hospitals incidence of TST conversion decreased significantly after the implementation of the administrative measures.110, 111 Administrative controls are the cheapest and simplest measures to implement, and all evidence suggests that they are effective and important. Hence, implementation of administrative control measures should be the first priority in all health care facilities.",

Infection control and occupational health practitioners, regulatory agencies, and researchers struggled with conflicting recommendations and confusing terminology regarding personal respirators. In 1994 a single standard was recommended: that personal respirators (masks) should filter at least 95% of particles of 1 \u03bcm or larger, with less than 10% face seal air leak.112 Respirators meeting these standards are referred to as N-95. Given that TB bacilli are 3 to 5 \u03bcm in length, these masks should filter at least 95% of TB bacilli out of the air inhaled by health care workers. Modeling studies have concluded that personal respirators should work well.113 On the other hand, there is no epidemiologic evidence of their effectiveness. No studies have been published in which only personal respirators were implemented. Some modeling studies have found that the effect of personal respirators is modest if they are used in a setting with proper engineering control measures.114 Fit testing of personal respirators is particularly controversial because studies have shown that the results of fit testing are not reliable or reproducible.115, 116 Nevertheless, most regulatory authorities and most health care institutions insist on fit testing because in theory a better-fitting personal respirator should provide more protection than one that allows some leakage.",

Usually these are installed above eye level in rooms with reflectors so that only the upper air in the room is irradiated. Occasionally such lamps have caused eye irritation as a result of reflected UV light from glossy ceilings.122 This reflection can be eliminated by use of low-gloss ceiling paint or louvered lamps so that the UV light is emitted only in a narrow beam in the upper air. Effectiveness of UVGI is summarized in Table 6\n. Effect of UVGI installation on TST conversion among hospital workers has been reported in 4 studies. In all 4, the incidence of tuberculin conversion declined substantially, but this may have been a result of other interventions, because UVGI was one of several interventions introduced at the same time. Two studies have irradiated upper air in rooms of patients with TB with UVGI; the air exhausted from these rooms was fed through an animal enclosure. In both studies, animals exposed to air from rooms with UV irradiation had substantially reduced incidence of TB infection and disease.123, 124, 128 In vitro studies have also shown the high potency of UVGI in reducing the number of viable airborne BCG,129 or viable mycobacterial cultures in solid media. Despite solid animal evidence of efficacy and clear evidence that it is safe for humans, authoritative agencies remain reluctant to endorse use of UVGI. As summarized in Table 7\n, UVGI has many advantages compared with mechanical ventilation in terms of proven effectiveness, low initial and recurrent costs, as well as proven safety, yet authoritative agencies continue to recommend it only as an adjunct measure.",

Interest in infection control with SARS was high because no effective vaccine or treatment was available at the time of the epidemic, and a high proportion of all SARS cases occurred as a result of nosocomial transmission. Ultimately the epidemic subsided following strict enforcement of control measures within health care facilities and in the community. Hence, this epidemic provides many important lessons that are applicable for prevention of nosocomial transmission of TB and influenza.",

First, the incubation period was longer than typical for influenza or other respiratory tract viral infections (4\u20136 days instead of 1\u20132 days; see Table 8\n) and the course of the illness was slower.147 Of particular relevance for nosocomial transmission, in most patients the viral load and viral shedding increased to a peak about 10 to 12 days after the onset of symptoms, following which there was a slow decline.146, 147 Because patients typically sought medical care and were hospitalized after a few days of symptoms they became progressively more contagious after their arrival in health care facilities. This situation may have accounted for the disproportionate share of transmission that occurred within health care facilities; it was estimated that 78% of all cases in Singapore, among patients and health care workers, resulted from nosocomial transmission.150 Overall, health care workers accounted for 21% of all cases,132 although in most countries they account for only 2% to 3% of the adult population. A rough estimate is that the risk of disease in health care workers was approximately 10-fold higher than the general population. A similar estimate can be derived from Hong Kong, where there was more extensive community transmission, yet the rates in health care workers were more than 10 times higher than the community rates in the worst affected areas.141\n",

The new pandemic of H1N1, which spread rapidly through air travel,170 and caused millions of cases,153 before a vaccine became available, underscores the importance of understanding the determinants of nosocomial transmission of influenza, to implement effective infection control.",

Risk factors for TB infection and disease are mostly associated with greater risk of exposure to patients with TB, particularly undiagnosed patients. Some risk factors relate to specific work activities that can cause aerosolization of TB bacilli.2.The simplest, cheapest, and quickest interventions to implement, with proven effectiveness, are the administrative measures of triage and separation of patients. These measures should be a part of all TB infection-control programs in all health care facilities.3.There is little direct evidence for the effectiveness of N-95 personal respirators for protection against occupational TB. Nevertheless, on theoretic grounds alone, their use is supported.4.There are sound theoretic reasons why air exchange (ventilation) should help reduce nosocomial TB transmission. There is evidence from several observational studies and one interventional study that higher levels of ventilation reduce risk of TB transmission. Natural ventilation can achieve high air exchange rates and should be effective as well as feasible in health facilities in LMIC. However, resultant airflow patterns within buildings are unpredictable, so natural ventilation may result in inadvertent exposure of workers or other patients.5.UVGI is grossly underused. This is a low-cost, simple, and safe technology. All available evidence suggests that it should be safe and highly effective in reducing nosocomial TB transmission.6.There are few epidemiologic studies on the effectiveness of infection control measures, alone or in combination, and their effect on reducing nosocomial TB transmission.7.For the prevention of nosocomial transmission of influenza, the most important action is vaccination of health care workers. However, if an effective vaccine is not available, then other infection-control measures become of paramount importance. For TB, SARS, and influenza, delayed diagnosis (or delayed institution of an effective treatment, if available) is the most common and important factor in nosocomial transmission. Hence, the most important measures are to promptly identify patients with these illnesses and separate them from other patients and from susceptible health care workers.8.Personal protective equipment including gowns, masks, and gloves is important to prevent transmission by droplet. This is a major mechanism of transmission for SARS and influenza, so should be the major method of protection for health care workers and prevention of spread by health care workers from one patient to another.9.However, there is clear evidence that airborne transmission of influenza and SARS can occur. Transmission is most likely during performance of procedures that cause aerosolization of infectious droplets, or with severely ill patients. Therefore, N-95 personal respirators, which should be more effective in preventing acquisition of airborne infections, should be used by workers caring for severely ill patients, or workers performing aerosol-generating procedures. In addition, these patients should be cared for, and procedures performed, in rooms with adequate ventilation and/or upper-air UVGI, as these environmental measures can further reduce the risk of airborne transmission.\n",
