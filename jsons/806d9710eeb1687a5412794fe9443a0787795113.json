The immunosuppressive effects of these agents that affect multiple 77 cytokine axes have the potential to increase susceptibility and spread of viral infections, including SARS-78CoV-2. 3 Lower doses of medication may allow for less frequent monitoring lab tests, minimizing patient 79 exposure risk. Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of the IL-4/IL-13 signaling pathway, is a 80 targeted immunomodulator with theoretical lower risk for SARS-CoV-2. It is reasonable for patients to 81 continue dupilumab during the pandemic; if viral infection symptoms are present, the decision on whether 82to continue the medication should be made on a case-by-case basis. Finally, we recommend halting 83 office-based phototherapy to minimize exposure, and instead encourage exposure of affected areas to 84 natural sunlight, bleach baths and wet wraps -inexpensive and effective alternatives. 85Mental health care: AD patients have a higher incidence of anxiety and depression than healthy 86 controls. Stress and social isolation during quarantine may exacerbate these conditions. Recommending 87 support groups through the National Eczema Association, engaging in moderate physical exercise, and 88 stress-reduction techniques, may benefit AD patients' emotional well-being and increase resilience.89 Finally, participating in global registries to collect data on AD patients will facilitate outcome tracking 90 and improvement of AD management during this time 91 (https://www.aad.org/member/practice/coronavirus/registry; covidderm.org). Though the future is 92 uncertain, the aforementioned recommendations can help to minimize risk of exposure and mitigate 93 consequences of the pandemic on AD disease course. 94 95 References: 96 1.
