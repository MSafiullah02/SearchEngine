The latter is often influenced by interventions due to political representation or by public administration institutions. However, interventions due to political representation are more often seen at the regional or local level.\n\n",

They do this by knitting together knowledge flows and the systems on which they rely, building trust and confidence in institutional reliability; and above all, they do it by generating institutional self-knowledge and a certain kind of collective dissatisfaction with the status quo. RIS comprise a set of institutions, both public and private, which produce pervasive and systemic effects that encourage firms in the region to adopt common norms, expectations, values, attitudes and practices, where a culture of innovation is nurtured and knowledge-transfer processes are enhanced (Matatkova and Stejskal 2011b).\n",

The RIS is composed of numerous interactions among the various social entities and this result in the creation of network capital. So to evaluate the how this social network thrives, the interdisciplinary methodology can be used. Social Network Analysis has therefore proven to be useful because it enables the visualization of how people are connected, thereby enabling users of this methodology to find out how best people and institutions interact to share knowledge in the RIS.

These procedures provide us with a better understanding into the various roles and categories in a network\u2014who constitute the connectors, where are the clusters and their makeup, who forms the center of the network, and who is on the periphery. This methodology can be relied upon in RIS when we endeavor to assess the rate at which knowledge and information flow across functional and institutional borders as in triple helix. It can also be useful when we want to find out who knows who (social relationships) and who might know what (expertise) in groups where individuals play key roles. One advantage of using this methodology in RIS is that, it provides it helps us to understand and simplifies the complex nature of interorganizational networks. It allows for comparative analysis by first of all mapping the already established network and its properties.",

The goal is that the objects within a group be similar (or related) to one another and different from (or unrelated to) the objects in other groups. The greater the similarity (or homogeneity) within a group and the greater the difference between groups the better or more distinct the clustering\u201d (Nowak et al. 2008). According to (Romesburg 2004), cluster analysis refers to combinations of mathematical models that can be utilized to group objects that are similar into the same group. All objects have their attributes which might not be the same, but when has many objects, there is bound to be different attributes, so these can be arrange to for a cluster. Cluster analysis is the best and widely used research method when it is necessary to examine the similarity of the objects.",

The cluster in reference here is not assumed to be the same as happens in other forms of interaction they are very similar and linked in the value chain. Clusters can either be horizontal or vertical (cross-sectorial) network that consist of industries that are not the same but complementary firms that have a specific specialization that can result in the creation of innovation (Morgan 1997). The cluster analysis approach differs from other conventional research approaches because it takes into account collaborations and knowledge flow within the network (Rouvinen and Yl\u00e4-Antilla 1999). Comparatively, the conventional research approaches have focuses on networks that have homogenous firms producing same products, but the cluster have proven to be a reliable alternative because, it offers a different view in the RIS in the sense that, it places premium on the interaction-based theories of innovation which many authors now called \u201ctriple helix\u201d (see Leydesdorff 2012; Vaivode 2015). This dynamic nature of the cluster analysis has made it a reliable alternative to the other traditional research approaches (Roelandt and Den Hertog 1999). Another reason that has made cluster analysis so important is its focus on vertical relationship and interdependence of actors who may not necessarily be similar firms or institutions (Roelandt and Den Hertog 1999).",

As a mathematical model, it is not faced with deficiencies, (Andersen and Petersen 1993) have concluded that the DEA methodology has been very successful in determining the relative efficiency in decision making units but the method does not allow us to rank how efficient these units are. In addition Kao and Liu (2000) have also described the use of DEA to measure efficiency as very difficult because of its (DEA) use of complex economic and behavioral entities. This becomes more difficult when multiple outputs and inputs need to be aggregated in isolation to determine efficiency.",

The study also found out that technical expertise and sales opportunities directly correlate with operational efficiency of 3PLs at the same time, there was no direct correlation between the size of 3PLs and their performance. Abbott and Doucouliagos (2003) also used the DEA model to evaluate the efficiency of Australian universities. Their result proved that irrespective of the blend of input and outputs, Australian universities recorded high levels of efficiency relatively when compared one by one. In a study to measure the performance of 500 manufacturing firms in Turkey D\u00fczak\u0131n and D\u00fczak\u0131n (2007) used the DEA methodology and came out with the conclusion that during 2003 nine firms efficiently performed in Turkey, and out of these nine firms ranked among themselves. Furthermore, each of the firms in the analysis was ranked within each industry, and the results were that 65 firms were efficient among the industries.",

The case study as an approach can be adopted for a study based on the research questions and the objectives the researcher wants to achieve. The case studies are pertinent when the research being undertaken addresses either a descriptive question or an explanatory question (Shavelson and Towne 2002). The case study therefore seeks to provide a rich description and detailed explanation of the reason behind a complex phenomenon, and why they have happened or remained as they are.",
