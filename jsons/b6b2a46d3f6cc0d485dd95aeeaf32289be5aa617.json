            "text": "Methods: This multicentre epidemiologic study collected data concerning paediatric tracheostomy from the JaRPAC database. Patients were divided into two groups: those with or without tracheostomies when they were discharged from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). Consecutive patients aged \u226416 years who did not undergo tracheostomy when admitted to ICU or PICU between April 2014 and March 2017 were included. Results: A total of 23 hospitals participated, involving 6199 paediatric patients registered in the JaRPAC database during the study period. Of the registered paediatric patients, 5769 (95%) patients were admitted to the ICUs or PICUs without tracheostomies. Among the patients, 181 patients (3.1%) had undergone tracheostomies. There were significant differences in chronic conditions (134, 74.0% versus 3096, 55.4%, p < 0.01), chromosomal anomalies (19, 10.5% versus 326, 5.8%, p < 0.01), urgent admission (151, 83.4% versus 3093, 55.4%, p < 0.01). More tracheostomies were performed on patients who were admitted for respiratory failure (61, 33.7% versus 926, 16.1%, p < 0.01) and for post-cardiac pulmonary arrest (CPA) resuscitation (40, 22.1% versus 71, 1.1%, p < 0.01). Conclusions: This is the first report to use a large-scale registry of critically ill paediatric patients in Japan to describe the interrelated factors of tracheostomies. Chronic conditions (especially for neuromuscular disease), chromosomal anomaly, admission due to respiratory failure, or treatment for post-CPA resuscitation all had the possibility to be risk factors for tracheostomy.",

Tracheostomy is a valuable procedure in children with severe respiratory compromise or upper airway obstruction. Recently, the clinical characteristics of children undergoing tracheostomy have changed, [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] being performed most often in children who have an airway obstruction or those who require prolonged mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure associated with chronic conditions, such as neuromuscular disease or bronchopulmonary dysfunction [8, 10] . The most common current indications of paediatric tracheostomy include prolonged ventilator dependence (as a consequence of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysfunction) and upper airway obstruction (resulting either from craniofacial or structural abnormalities of the upper airway or hypotonia stemming from neurological or neuromuscular disturbance) [11] . Additionally, there has been an increasing number of children surviving with high medical needs for whom tracheostomy and/or home ventilation is part of their chronic disease management [4] .",

These patients were divided into two groups: those who received tracheostomies while in ICU or PICU (tracheostomy group) and patients without tracheostomies (no-tracheostomy group). Risk factors for tracheostomy were evaluated using the JaRPAC data. The cause of admission was divided into six categories: respiratory failure, circulatory failure, neurological dysfunction, post-operative care, tight observation, and recovery from cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA). The final diagnosis for each patient was registered and assigned as either an intrinsic or an extrinsic cause. Intrinsic disease was coded based on the International Classification of Diseases v. 10 (ICD-10) and categorized into one of ten groups (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, gastrointestinal/hepato-biliary-pancreatic, haematologic/ oncologic, renal, sepsis, metabolic/endocrinologic, allergic groups, and others) in order to ensure sufficient patients for analysis.",

As a result of changes to adult practice which have been driven by research data that are largely absent in the paediatric population, it is difficult to establish evidence-based indications for the paediatric population [22] . Prolonged intubation, ventilator dependence, and neurological or neuromuscular disorders can all be interrelated and difficult to separate. The complications, such as ARDS or VAP might be related to tracheostomy due to the longer mechanical ventilation. Having many classifications of indications can be helpful for the sake of specificity, but subclassifying the patient groups makes them much smaller, making meaningful comparison more difficult [11] . Consistent with a survey of Canadian paediatric intensivists, common indications of tracheostomy varied widely between institutes [31] . This means that there are no definitive guidelines. As a result, the indication and timing of tracheostomy depends on individual institutions or physicians. Koltai et al. reported that the long-term neurological status of children was the most consistent predictor of an ongoing tracheostomy requirement [32] . This is consistent with our study, in which the proportion of patients with neuromuscular disease and respiratory failure were significantly higher than in the control group.",
