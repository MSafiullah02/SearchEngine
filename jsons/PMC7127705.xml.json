Both siRNA and oligofectamine complexes were mixed and kept for incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 45 min. Meanwhile B95a cells were trypsinized and cells were counted using haemocytometer, 4 \u00d7 105 cell concentration was used for siRNA transfections. siRNA and oligofectamine complexes (total volume 100 \u03bcl) per well were added to a 12 well plate and again 100 \u03bcl of Opti-MEM was added to the wells. 4 \u00d7 105 cells were added to each wells and antibiotic free growth medium (5% FCS) was added to make the final volume up to 500 \u03bcl. Cells was incubated under a 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h. After 48 h incubation, media was changed and again 50 pmol of siRNA added to the cells (50 pmol of siRNA in 1 \u03bcl of oligofectamine). Again cells were incubated under a 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C for next 24 h. 72 h after post original siRNA transfection, one set of cells were used for RNA extraction to study inhibition of B95a SLAM using real-time PCR. Another set of cells was infected with 103TCID50 of PPRV after 72 h of initial siRNA transfection and cytopathic effect (CPE) observed. After 48 h post virus infection, cells were frozen-thawed and used for virus titration (Dhinakar Raj et al., 2000) and another set of cells used for RNA extraction to study effects of SLAM inhibition on virus replication in terms of PPRV \u2018M\u2019 gene expression.
