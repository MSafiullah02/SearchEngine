            "text": "Emergency department (ED) evaluation and treatment before hospital admission expedites patient care, improves patient safety, facilitates appropriate patient disposition within the hospital, and, in some cases, decreases hospital admission rates. 1-3 However, hospitals must balance the use of the ED as a portal of entry with concerns about increasing ED volumes, wait times, overcrowding, discontinuity of patient care, increased handoffs, and cost. 4,5 Such concerns have led to national efforts to reduce unnecessary ED utilization. 6 Direct admission to an inpatient hospital ward without ED visit is a frequently employed alternative strategy. 3,7 National studies have found that direct admissions account for 25% of all unscheduled pediatric hospital admissions; 95% of the US hospitals accept patients for direct admission, though only one-third have a policy in place governing this process. 7, 8 Direct hospital admission without ED evaluation has potential benefits, including improvements in continuity of care, efficiency, referring physician satisfaction, and patient and family experience as well as reduced ED overcrowding and healthcare costs. 3, 4, 7, 8 However, direct admission also has risks, including inaccurate determination of the need for hospital admission and potential delay in the evaluation and treatment of unstable or critically ill patients through a placement to an inappropriate level of inpatient care. 4, 7, 8 Three pediatric studies have evaluated the safety of direct hospital admission by Issue 2 \u2022 Volume 5 Abstract Introduction: Direct hospital admission of children without evaluation in the emergency department (ED) is common, but few guidelines exist to maximize safety by assessing patient stability. This report describes a novel approach to support patient safety. Methods: An interdisciplinary children's hospital team developed a brief ED-based evaluation process called the ED Rapid Assessment of Patients Intended for Inpatient Disposition (ED RAPID). It entails a brief evaluation of vital signs and clinical stability by the ED attending physician and nurse. Children deemed stable are admitted to inpatient wards, whereas those requiring immediate intervention undergo full ED evaluation and disposition. We assessed outcomes for all children evaluated through this process from March 2013 through February 2015. Results: During the study period, we identified 715 patients undergoing ED RAPID evaluation. Of these, we directly admitted 691 (96.4%) to the hospital ward after ED RAPID evaluation; median ED treatment time was 4.0 minutes. We transitioned 24 (3.4%) to full ED evaluation, 14 (2.0%) because a ward bed was unavailable, and 10 (1.4%) for clinical reasons identified in the evaluation. We admitted four of the 10 stopped (40% of stops, 0.6% of total) to an intensive care unit, and 6 (60% of stops, 0.8% of total) to the hospital ward after ED care. Eight children (1.1%) admitted to the hospital ward after ED RAPID evaluation required a transfer to an intensive care unit within 12 hours. Conclusion: The ED RAPID evaluation process for children directly admitted to the hospital was feasible and effective in this setting.",

Before the implementation of the process described here, our hospital allowed direct admission to the hospital ward at the discretion of the accepting provider, without specific tracking of patient outcomes. In response to a sentinel event in which a deteriorating patient presented directly to the pediatric inpatient ward and suffered a serious adverse outcome, an interdisciplinary hospital team developed a novel ED evaluation process for children accepted for direct admission to the hospital.

Patient caregivers or Emergency Medical Services (EMS) transport teams are directed to present to the ED. On arrival, they are evaluated in the triage area (if arriving via private transport) or ED hallway (if EMS transport) by an ED attending physician and an ED nurse. The evaluation includes vital signs and a brief evaluation by the physician and the nurse to assess clinical stability and the potential need for urgent intervention. If the patient is stable, the ED nurse and physician document the ED RAPID evaluation encounter in the EHR using very brief standardized documentation templates (Fig. 1) . Then, the patient is escorted directly to the inpatient hospital ward. If the patient is found to have signs of respiratory, cardiovascular, or neurologic instability necessitating resuscitation or other urgent intervention, 12 the ED RAPID process is stopped, and the patient becomes a standard ED patient. The entire process of ED RAPID evaluation and documentation was designed to take the ED physician and the nurse less than 5 minutes. Figure 2 outlines the process.

An in-depth review revealed that process failures occurred because of bed unavailability during times of high inpatient census or because communication of the direct admission plan was incomplete, but never because of ED physician or nurse unavailability. To address these process failures, leaders have emphasized the need for accepting physicians to secure an inpatient bed before patient transport, and in some cases, when safe and feasible, to consider requesting a delay of transfer to await bed availability. The 4-minute total time required for the process further supports its feasibility. This time measurement does not include time spent on phone calls, but the phone conversations required to accept an ED RAPID evaluation patient are similar to those required to accept any transfer patient.",

This ICU bounce rate is slightly higher than our institution's 0.65% bounce rate for routine ED patients, but is similar to one published report comparing direct admissions and ED hospitalizations. 9 Another report of a pediatric direct admission process discussed the need to follow ICU bounce rates as a quality measure but did not report outcomes. 11 As with ED stops, ICU bounces were younger and more likely to have respiratory conditions. Particularly, in the 50% of ICU bounce cases where a transfer occurred more than 6 hours after admission, these transfers may represent the unpredictable and unavoidable progression of the disease.

The same is true, however, for any currently existing systems for accepting and placing referred patients. Second, the implementation of the process required an upfront expenditure of time and ongoing commitment among stakeholders. These stakeholders include EMS providers, who accepted a brief delay in their transfer process, ED staff, who accepted brief additional tasks and the need to balance performance of the ED RAPID evaluation with other patient care needs, and inpatient staff, who accepted a new step in the process of admitting their patients. In this setting, there was sufficient motivation for this in the dual goals of ensuring the safety of directly admitted patients and avoiding the inconvenience to patients and staff of unnecessary full ED evaluations. Third, process implementation required information technology resources to overcome initial barriers, including the development of new processes to allow ED staff to document for a new class of patients and the creation of an EHR entry before arrival for patients new to the system.",

Furthermore, although it may have been useful to compare ED RAPID evaluation patients to patients pre-emptively diverted from the process by accepting staff, there was no mechanism to identify such patients, and we do not describe them here. Likewise, as we did not prospectively track the phone calls involved in arranging the direct admissions, we are unable to comment on the frequency with which the process required multiple phone calls or the time spent in phone coordination. Also, the ED RAPID evaluation process was not intended to identify direct admission patients that may have been safely discharged home after ED evaluation and care. Thus, we may have admitted some patients via the process that could have been treated and discharged from the ED. However, the ED RAPID evaluation process does not increase this likelihood when compared with standard direct admission. We do not currently have data regarding the effects of this process on patient-centered outcomes such as patient satisfaction, admission throughput, and the frequency of brief admissions that additional ED-based management may have averted; quality improvement targeting these outcomes would be a useful area for further research. Although the ED RAPID evaluation process includes formal evaluation of vital signs, it ultimately relies on a brief clinical assessment by ED attending physicians and nurses rather than standardized, objective measures.
