Travelers may be at increased risk of certain respiratory tract infections (RTIs) due to travel itself (mingling and close quarters in airports, airplanes, cruise ships, and hotels; and risk of influenza, legionellosis, and tuberculosis [TB]) and due to unique exposure at travel destinations (melioidosis, plague, Q fever, coccidioidomycosis, and histoplasmosis). Travel-related respiratory infections can lead to importation and secondary transmission, as occurred during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, and more recently with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and H1N1 influenza.4 This chapter reviews causative agents, clinical manifestations, and management approaches for travel-related RTIs.",

Acute coryzal illness, traditionally referred to as a \u201ccommon cold,\u201d manifests as nasal discharge and obstruction, sneezing, and sore throat, and is most commonly caused by viruses, including rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus (especially coxsackievirus A21), coronaviruses, and metapneumonia virus. Acute laryngitis is characterized by hoarseness of voice with a deepened pitch, with possible episodes of aphonia. Often these signs are associated with those of coryza and pharyngitis. Common causes of laryngitis include parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, and adenovirus. Less frequently, laryngitis can be caused by bacteria including Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae. Pharyngitis is also most commonly viral in origin, although streptococcal disease accounts for a significant minority. Other causes of pharyngitis include Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).Box 59.1Most Common Etiologic Agents of Upper Respiratory Tract Infections\n\nAlt-text: Box 59.1",

No additional diagnostic procedures are required and treatment is usually supportive. The diagnosis of laryngitis is also clinical, and treatment is usually supportive. Although the diagnosis of pharyngitis is also clinical, it is important to identify individuals with pharyngitis caused by group A streptococcal infection from other causes to lessen the likelihood of subsequent sequelae, including glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever. Bacterial pharyngitis is reportedly associated with more severe pharyngeal pain, odynophagia, and higher fever, with grayish-yellow exudate on the tonsils and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. However, clinical criteria are unreliable to identify bacterial pharyngitis/tonsillitis because a typical presentation occurs in <50% of cases. Rapid antigen detection tests are available with a specificity >95% when compared with blood-agar plate cultures and sensitivity of 80%\u201390%, and should generally be performed in patients ill enough to seek medical care for pharyngitis, especially in young children. A negative rapid test should be followed by a confirmatory throat culture in children and adolescents but not necessarily in adults. Nucleic acid amplification tests including isothermal loop amplification are also available in some locations with a high degree of specificity and sensitivity as well as a rapid turnaround time. A treatment course with penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days is appropriate to treat pharyngitis due to Streptococcus pyogenes. Diphtheria is a rare cause of pharyngitis, with a potentially fatal outcome. It is characterized by a thick and gray pharyngeal and tracheal membrane that bleeds upon attempted removal. Diagnosis is based on clinical recognition and culture isolation of a toxigenic strain of C. diphtheriae. The mainstay of therapy is diphtheria antitoxin, associated with antibiotic treatment with penicillin or macrolides.

Examination usually discloses pulmonary crepitation, rhonchi, and adventitial sounds. Chest imaging should be used to further characterize and define pulmonary involvement. Complications of pneumonia include pulmonary cavitation, pneumothorax, and empyema formation. In many facilities, it is now standard to collect nasopharyngeal swabs or washings from patients with severe RTIs and pneumonia, and to apply rapid antigen tests to assess for common respiratory viruses, including influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and metapneumonia virus. Although the majority of cases with radiologic evidence of pneumonia may still have a viral infection, the proportion of cases due to bacteria is high enough to usually warrant systematic antibacterial treatment, especially if a viral screen is unrevealing. The chest film is not helpful in making a specific etiologic diagnosis; however, lobar consolidation, cavitation, and large pleural effusions support a bacterial cause. Pneumococcal disease is often characterized by abrupt onset of fever, cough, rapid respiration, and lobar consolidation on chest film. Atypical pneumonias caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae may be characterized by gradual onset of symptoms, cough progressive from dry to productive, chest film worse than symptoms, and normal peripheral white blood cell counts. Overall, however, the clinical presentation is not specific enough to make an etiologic diagnosis, and effective methods to recognize the causative agent of pneumonia are not available. The sputum Gram stain is a simple, quick, and inexpensive procedure, but its helpfulness in establishing a specific etiologic diagnosis is uncertain. The utility of the sputum culture is also unclear, since the procedure is insensitive: Only half of patients with pneumonia produce sputum and contamination occurs in one-third. An advantage of routine sputum Gram stain and culture is that these procedures would capture rare causes of pneumonia such as TB and melioidosis in travelers. Because the cause of pneumonia cannot be determined on the basis of any specific clinical, radiographic, or laboratory parameter, antibiotic therapy is usually initiated empirically. Treatment should be effective on S. pneumoniae, the most frequently responsible agent, and on agents of atypical pneumonia: M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and legionella infections.",

Human infections are primarily acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. In 1997 human infections with the H5N1 virus were reported during an outbreak in poultry in Hong Kong SAR, China. Since 2003 this avian virus has spread from Asia to Europe and Africa, and has resulted in millions of poultry infections, several hundred recognized human cases, and a high case-fatality rate.34 In 2013 human infections with the H7N9 virus were reported in China.35 Since then, the virus has spread in the poultry population across the country and resulted in several hundred human cases and many human deaths. Other avian influenza viruses have resulted in sporadic human infections including the H7N7 and H9N2 viruses. Some countries have also reported sporadic human infections with swine influenza viruses, particularly the H1N1 and the H3N2 subtypes. In many patients infected by A(H5) or A(H7N9) avian influenza viruses, common initial symptoms are high fever (\u226538\u00b0C) and cough. Signs and symptoms of lower respiratory tract involvement including dyspnea or difficulty breathing are common. Complications of infection include hypoxemia, multiple organ dysfunction, and secondary bacterial and fungal infections. The case fatality rate for A(H5) and A(H7N9) subtype virus infections among humans is much higher than that of seasonal influenza infections. Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs, notably oseltamivir and peramivir, can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve survival. Since their availability may be limited in some areas, travelers with a high likelihood of exposure (poultry workers, veterinarians, or medical doctors in endemic areas) should consider bringing these drugs with them. Currently no vaccines for avian influenza in humans are commercially available. Particular attention should be given to travelers planning to visit areas endemic for avian influenza in poultry and where human cases have occurred. Such areas are currently found in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Advice should focus on avoiding contact with patients suffering from respiratory disease, and contact with birds and their excreta at live bird markets or farms, as well as avoiding contact with and consumption of insufficiently cooked poultry products.4 Human-to-human transmission has fortunately been highly sporadic thus far, and limited to very close contacts. However, should such viruses mutate to become steadily transmissible in the human community, a new deadly pandemic influenza could emerge.",

Several changes in our globalizing world contribute to the growing importance of travelers in spreading influenza: (i) steady increase in total travel volume worldwide, (ii) advent of mass tourism, and (iii) increasing numbers of immunocompromised and elderly travelers.4 Mutsch et al. found that 1% of the travelers enrolled in a study of influenza virus infection in persons traveling to tropical and subtropical countries seroconverted to influenza during their trip, and that 40% of those who seroconverted had sought medical attention during travel. Influenza virus infections were acquired largely in Asia (48%), Africa (28%), and Latin America (25%).36 Travelers acquire influenza both as sporadic cases and as clusters from common sources aboard ships, airplanes or in airports, and in tour groups. All described outbreaks are caused by the type A virus, and are characterized by involvement of a large proportion of the population at risk and the explosive nature of outbreaks. Data collected from GeoSentinel and EuroTravNet indicate that in 2008, prior to the H1N1 pandemic, the number of influenza confirmed cases was at just 0.1%. During 2009, however, the number of confirmed influenza cases in GeoSentinel rose to 11%, 12%, 18%, and as high as 32% with the majority of these attributable to H1N1.7, 37 Influenza is a common infection also among hajj pilgrims, with approximately 20,000 estimated cases per hajj season.38\n",

Because it can manifest months or years after leaving the endemic area, patients may not remember the exposure event and its potential relationship to their symptoms. The diagnosis can be confirmed by Gram stain and culture of respiratory specimen and/or blood.

Therapy should be guided by antimicrobial susceptibility tests. For severe disease, prolonged treatment for 2\u20136 months is recommended to prevent relapses.

The incubation period is 2\u20135 days, but spores can germinate up to 60 days after exposure. Pathogenesis is mediated by a toxin responsible for hemorrhage, edema, and necrosis. The presenting symptoms are nonspecific, with mild fever, malaise, and a nonproductive cough. After a period of a few days in which the patient's condition apparently improves, a second phase begins with high fever, respiratory distress, cyanosis, and subcutaneous edema of the neck and thorax. Crepitant rales are evident on auscultation. Inhalation anthrax is almost invariably fatal with a very short time between the onset of the second phase, mediastinal signs, and death. The diagnosis of inhalation anthrax is extremely difficult outside of epidemic conditions. Direct examination and Gram stain of the sputum specimen are unlikely to be positive. A serologic ELISA test is available, although a significant increase in titer is usually obtained only in convalescent subjects who survive. The most useful bacteriologic test in case of suspicion, however, is a blood culture demonstrating B. anthracis. Treatment of inhalation anthrax should be as early as possible and usually involves a carbapenem, penicillin, doxycycline, and fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. Ancillary treatment to sustain vascular volume, cardiac, pulmonary, and renal functions is essential.",

Permanent plague foci exist in the Americas among native rodent and flea populations in Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, and the United States.53 The 1994 Indian epidemic, where a total of 5150 suspected pneumonic or bubonic cases occurred in a 3-month period, caused travel and trade disruption and resulted in severe economic repercussions.54 Travelers are rarely affected by plague while visiting endemic areas (e.g., no visitors were affected during the 1994 epidemic in India).
