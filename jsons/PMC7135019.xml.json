Soap and disinfectant should not be used on the internal components of syringes. Remove as much water as possible from the syringe and allow it to cool before use, because heat inactivates modified live viral vaccines. Some syringes may need to be disassembled to adequately clean them. Disassembly should be performed on a clean work surface followed by cleaning the components with hot tap water, avoiding the use of soap or disinfectant. If syringes are physically contaminated enough to require disassembly for cleaning, they should be boiled for 5 minutes in deionized or distilled water. Plastic, continuous feed syringes can be sanitized after cleaning, if necessary. The syringe and tubing should be filled with distilled water and wrapped in multiple layers of paper towels. After soaking the paper towels in water, the syringe is placed in an unclosed zip-lock bag. This bag is placed in a microwave oven for 5 minutes using the high setting. Care should be taken that the paper towels do not dry out during this process. Syringes should be individually microwaved when using this method.

Thirty-eight (19.9%) operated at the correct temperature 66% to 95% of the time, whereas 34 (17.8%) operated properly 36% to 65% of the time and 23 (12.0%) were in the correct range 5% to 35% of the time. The remaining 45 refrigerators (23.6%) operated at the desired temperature less than 5% of the time. Nearly 43% of these 191 refrigerators were greater than 10 years old. The second study evaluated 176 refrigerators.3 Producer refrigerators accounted for 129 of the 176, whereas 47 were feedstore or veterinary clinic refrigerators. Forty (31%) of the 129 refrigerators operated at the correct temperature greater than 95% of the time, with another 19 (14.5%), operating properly 66% to 95% of the time. Forty-three (33.3%) were at the correct temperature less than 5% of the time. The retail coolers were similar, in that 16 (34%) were at the correct temperature greater than 95% of the time. Seven (14.9%) operated properly 66% to 95% of the time and 10 (21.3%), were at the correct temperature 36% to 65% of the time.
