The phagemid preparation from the original library was first digested with NcoI and SpeI, followed by electrophoresis on an agarose gel to delete the entire heavy-chain variable domain (VH) repertoire. The gene encoding the VH of m102 was amplified by error-prone polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Stratagene) to introduce random mutations and then fused with the CH1 gene fragment by use of splicing by overlapping extension PCR. The fused fragment was digested with NcoI and SpeI and purified from gel; it was then ligated into the purified backbone vector to create the VLs-shuffled Fab repertoire. Escherichia coli TG1 cells were transformed with the ligation mixtures via electroporation. The transformed TG1 cells were plated on 2\u00d7 yeast extract\u2013tryptone (2YT) agar plates containing 100 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin and 2% glucose (2YTAG). After incubation overnight at 37\u00b0C, all of the colonies grown on the plates were scraped into 5 mL of 2YTAG medium, mixed with 1.2 mL of 50% glycerol (final concentration, 10%), aliquoted, and stored at \u221270\u00b0C as the library stock. Two rounds of biopanning were performed on sGHeV conjugated magnetic beads as described for the original library panning [13]. Eight clones were identified as affinity-maturated antibodies, and m102.4 was selected for further characterization. Selected Fabs and m102.4 IgG1 expression and purification was performed as described elsewhere [14]",

A baseline blood sample was collected from an axillary vein, and a 20-g intravenous catheter was placed in the left jugular vein. The antibody m102.4 was administered via the catheter by slow infusion over 2 minutes; 2 ferrets received 25 mg of m102.4 and 2 ferrets received 5 mg of m102.4. The catheter was withdrawn, and animals were allowed to recover from the anesthetic. Subsequently, the ferrets were anesthetized on days 1, 4, 8, 12,18, 21, 28, 35, and 42 by intramuscular injection with ketamine (Ketamil; Ilium) and medetomidine (Domitor; Novartis) (reversed with atipamazole [Antisedan; Novartis]). Blood was collected from an axillary or jugular vein while animals were under anesthesia. After collection of the final blood sample, the animals were euthanized by means of an intravenous barbiturate overdose. For all samples, serum was aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Ferret serum was diluted 1:1000 and assayed by use of the binding multiplex microsphere assay described above. An m102.4 standard curve ranging from 500 ng/mL to 0.5 ng/mL and all ferret serum samples were assayed simultaneously. Ferret serum m102.4 concentrations were extrapolated from the standard curve using nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPad software; GraphPad). Half-lives were estimated from the slopes of the natural logarithms of the antibody concentration as function of time by using the formulas ta=0.69/a[[ln(2)=0.69] and tb=0.69/b[[ln(2)=0.69], where ta and tb are the distribution and elimination half-lives, respectively, a and b are measured as the slopes of ln (m102.4 concentration, \u03bcg/mL) dependent on time",

One of these antibodies, m102, exhibited the highest level of cross-reactivity and relatively better binding to NiV G than to HeV G. We reasoned that improving m102\u2019s binding to HeV G could further increase its cross-reactive neutralizing activity by increasing its affinity to HeV G. To mature in vitro m102, we constructed an antibody library\u2014which contained approximately 2\u00d7108 clones\u2014by light-chain shuffling combined with heavy-chain VH random mutations introduced by error-prone PCR. Two rounds of panning against sGHeV conjugated to magnetic beads demonstrated sufficient enrichment (data not shown), and 190 random colonies were screened by phage ELISA. The 24 best binders were selected for sequencing analysis. They represented 8 different clones, which were designated m102.1\u2013m102.8. Although there were no amino acid sequence changes, silent mutations occurred in the VH regions in 3 of the 8 clones (data not shown), indicating that the error-prone PCR had worked. Seven of the 8 different light chains were from V \u03ba subfamily III, which is the same as that of m102; 1 clone (m102.8) was from the V \u03ba subfamily I. A sequence analysis of these light chains showed that all clones contained mutations in all 3 complementarity-determining regions; of the 7 clones from subfamily III, m102.4 had the largest number of mutations (data not shown)",

As shown in figure 2A, m102.4 binds to both sGHeV and sGNiV in a dose-dependent fashion. At relatively low concentrations (in the range of 50 ng/mL or less), the binding reached 50% of its maximum, indicating strong binding to both soluble G proteins. Furthermore, the multiplex assays also demonstrated that m102.4 is highly efficacious in blocking the binding of ephrin-B2 ligand (EFNB2) to both sGHeV and sGNiV (figure 2B). It is important to note that the increase in affinity did not alter the specificity of the Fab; it could still bind to both G proteins very well. It is also interesting to note that m102.4 binds sGNiV better than sGHeV, a result that was also reflected in its slightly better efficiency at blocking EFNB2-sGNiV binding. These results suggest that m102.4 is a cross-reactive, high-affinity binder to the soluble forms of both HeV G and NiV G glycoproteins",

A comparison with a previously identified antibody, m101, which is specific for HeV and the most potent inhibitor of infectious HeV [13], suggested that m102.4 and m101 had comparable activity in both Fab and IgG1 formats (figure 3B). Interestingly, and similar to the multiplexed results, the inhibitory activity against NiV G\u2013mediated cell fusion was higher than that against HeV G\u2013mediated fusion although m102.4 was selected by using sGHeV. These results suggest m102.4 possesses exceptional cross-reactivity and potency against HeV and NiV Env-mediated cell fusion and syncytia formation",

These data suggest a strong correlation between binding to the antigens, inhibition of fusion, and neutralization of infectious virus and confirm the exceptional potency and cross-reactivity of m102.4. IgG1 m102.4 was also evaluated in the sensitive Vero cell-foci-immunostaining assay overnight side by side with IgG1 m101 (figure 4). In this case, not only was the amount of virus per well high (4000 TCID50 for HeV and 2000 TCID50 for NiV), but the antibody-virus mixtures were incubated on Vero cell monolayers overnight. If no antibody was present (panels A and F), there was massive coalesced syncytia for both viruses. In the presence of m101, HeV was neutralized to localized foci at 10 \u03bcg/mL, which was further reduced to individual infected cells at 50 \u03bcg/mL. Importantly, if this assay was carried out as a standard cytopathic effect\u2013based neutralization assay, these wells would essentially look uninfected. By comparison, m102.4 neutralized 100% of HeV and NiV at either 10 \u03bcg/mL or 50 \u03bcg/mL. This extended neutralization window demonstrates the exceptional potency of m102.4 and may have important implications for postexposure therapeutic efficacy",

The binding of HeV G mutants D260A, G439A, K443A, and K465A to both m101 and m102.4 was almost absent, whereas the mutations G449A and D468A significantly decreased the binding of both antibodies, although they did so to varying degrees (figure 5). Interestingly, one mutation, K560A, almost completely eliminated the binding of the HeV-specific antibody m101 but did not have any effect on the binding of the cross-reactive antibody m102.4. Bishop et al. [15] showed that all 4 mutations\u2014D260A, G439A, K443A and K465A\u2014that eliminated the binding of both MAbs in this study are detrimental for the binding of HeV G to the receptor ephrin-B2.

Middleton; unpublished data) and have become important animal models for several other human respiratory viruses, including SARS coronavirus and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. Ferrets received 1 of 2 different doses of m102.4 (25 or 5 mg), as detailed above. Animals were closely observed for at least 2 hours after recovery, and no adverse effects were noted. Blood samples were collected over a 42-day period, and antibody concentrations were measured.

Average distribution and elimination half-lives of 1.48 days and 3.53 days, respectively, were calculated, with relatively small individual differences. To determine whether the relatively short elimination half-life was the result of immune responses, we tested the ferret serum for anti-m102.4 ferret antibodies.

Importantly, the substantial gain in potency was achieved without decreasing cross-reactivity. To our knowledge, this is the first fully human antibody that is capable of potently neutralizing both infectious HeV and NiV. An interesting observation made during the present study was that m102.4 had better binding to sGNiV than to sGHeV, despite the fact that sGHeV was used as the selector antigen during the original library screening [13] and in the maturation panning procedures. The better binding to sGNiV correlated with better neutralizing activity against NiV, compared with HeV. Further studies are required to understand the mechanism underlying this unexpected observation",

It was previously shown by Bishop et al. [15] that K560A had no effect on the binding of HeV G to the henipavirus receptors ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3. Thus, the m101 epitope may contain contact site(s) located outside the receptor binding site. Because the m102.4 epitope does not include this site, one could hypothesize that it overlaps the receptor binding site to larger extent than the m101 epitope does. Such a hypothesis is in agreement with m102.4\u2019s much higher observed degree of cross-reactivity, compared with that of m101. Thus, one could further hypothesize that the m102.4 epitope closely mimics the receptor binding site and, therefore, that the generation of escape mutants in the presence of this antibody would be less likely, compared with m101 and indeed any other known HMAb. We have previously made similar observation for our potent cross-reactive neutralizing HMAb m396, which is predicted to be effective against all SARS coronavirus isolates with known sequences [17]. The m396 binding site overlaps extensively with the receptor binding site on the SARS coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein, as shown by the crystal structure of the m396-S complex [18]. Thus, targeting the conserved and functionally important receptor binding site that is critical for virus entry into cells is a promising strategy for the development of cross-neutralizing antibodies",
