            "text": "HRSV is a major cause of severe acute respiratory illness in infants and young children worldwide (Nair et al., 2010). Two HRSV subgroups, A and B, and multiple genotypes within each subgroup have been described (Mufson et al., 1985; Peret et al., 2000). In natural human infections, protection between homologous subgroup viruses is more pronounced than between heterologous subgroups (Mufson et al., 1987), a finding confirmed in animal challenge studies (Johnson et al., 1987). Some studies have suggested that infection with HRSV subgroup A viruses yield more severe infections than subgroup B (Hall et al., 1990; Laham et al., 2017; Walsh et al., 1997), although other studies have reported no significant differences (Devincenzo, 2004; Fodha et al., 2007). Molecular assays that discriminate between HRSV subgroups would facilitate studying the prevalence of subgroups, potential differences in clinical presentations, and immune responses to subgroup which may eventually help better inform the development of HRSV vaccines and immunotherapies (Vandini et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Reliable methods for detection of HRSV may be useful for clinical management and accurate disease burden estimates. Whereas antigen-based HRSV assays have proven useful in the clinical setting for testing infants and young children, molecular diagnostic methods are more sensitive generally and particularly with older children and adults that more often present with low viral loads and later into their illnesses (Mahony, 2008). Given their inherent design advantages and wide general use, real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays for HRSV that both detect and discriminate between the two HRSV subgroups are available (Kuypers et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2016; Perkins et al., 2005; van Elden et al., 2003). However, a weakness inherent to all molecular assays is their susceptibility to pathogen strain variation that evolve overtime leading to primer/probe mismatches and potential false negative results (Suss et al., 2009; Whiley and Sloots, 2005, 2006). To remain viable, molecular assays must \u201cevolve\u201d with the pathogen. Instructive of this, Kamau et al. (2017) recently described their failure to detect HRSV among some immunofluorescence assay (IFA) positive specimens using a widely used multiplex respiratory pathogen rRT-PCR assay (Gunson et al., 2005) that acquired HRSV primer/probe sequences from an assay reported in 2003 by van Elden et al. (2003). The investigation revealed that the IFA-positive-rRT-PCR-negative samples collected during 2014/15 and 2015/16 HRSV epidemic seasons in Kilifi, Kenya, contained a new HRSV B strain with polymorphisms in the rRT-PCR probe region that hindered annealing. The authors noted that failure to detect these strains could have adversely affected studies that used this assay (Anderson et al., 2013; Choudhary et al., 2013; Gimferrer et al., 2015). To address this, we have developed and validated a novel duplex rRT-PCR assay using the most current HRSV genome sequence data available in GenBank. This assay will allow sensitive and specific detection and subgroup identification of HRSV, including possible dual infections.",

Primers/probe sets were selected using Primer Express v2.0 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA) and by visual inspection following real-time hydrolysis probe assay design guidelines (Rodriguez et al., 2015). Potential interference from sequence secondary structure was assessed in the target region using the Mfold web server (Zuker, 2003). Primer/probes targeting conserved regions in the HRSV nucleoprotein (N) gene were designed to discriminate between HRSV subgroups A and B and be compatible in a duplex reaction. Primer/probes were synthesized by the CDC Biotechnology Core Facility and probes were HPLC-purified. To minimize overlap in dye emission spectra, the HRSV A probe was labeled at the 5\u2032-end with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and the HRSV B probe was labeled at the 5\u2032-end with CAL Fluor Red 610.

Extracts were stored at \u221270 \u00b0C until use. The duplex rRT-PCR assay for subgrouping HRSV was developed following amplification conditions previously described for the CDC reference rRT-PCR pan-HRSV assay that does not distinguish between HRSV subgroups (Fry et al., 2010). Briefly, the assay was performed in 25 \u03bcl reactions containing 0.2 \u03bcM forward and reverse primers, 0.05 \u03bcM HRSV A probe, 0.05 \u03bcM HRSV B probe, and 5 \u03bcl of extracted RNA on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx real-time PCR instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the AgPath-ID\u2122 One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems/Life Technologies). Thermocycling conditions consisted of 10 min at 45 \u00b0C for reverse transcription, 10 min at 95 \u00b0C for activation of the Taq polymerase, and 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0C and 1 min at 55 \u00b0C. Each run included one viral template control (see below) and one non-template control. A specimen was considered positive for HRSV A or B if a well-defined fluorescence curve crossed the auto threshold setting within 45 cycles. Specificity of the duplex HRSV rRT-PCR was evaluated by testing other respiratory pathogens (RNA and DNA genomes) also using the AgPath-ID\u2122 One-Step RT-PCR kit which has been validated for simultaneous testing of RNA and DNA pathogens (Weinberg et al., 2013).",

A review of more recent HRSV genomes deposited in GenBank following study completion found 31 sequences that contained two single base substitutions in the primer/probe region of the duplex assay that would also predict compromised performance; one at the 3\u2032-terminis of the forward primer and the other near the middle of RSV B probe (e.g., MF973158). A review of sequences obtained from clinical specimens in our study found two (8221 and 8266) with identical substitutions (unpublished result).

In another, older assay (Perkins et al., 2005), melting temperatures of rRT-PCR probes were lower than their corresponding primers, which would result in a lower percentage of probe bound to the target during each amplification cycle, compromising assay sensitivity (Rodriguez et al., 2015). To exploit short regions of homology in the HRSV genome for primer/probe targeting, some assays used short probes with 3\u2032-minor groove binder (MGB) moieties to increase the stability of the probe\u2013target hybrid (Kuypers et al., 2004; You et al., 2017). However, MGB probes were originally designed to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms and are inherently susceptible to base mismatch destabilization (Whiley and Sloots, 2006; Yao et al., 2006).",

Moreover, when primer/probe changes are needed to accommodate new genetic variants, regulatory requirements can delay implementation.

Sequencing identified mismatched bases in the probe\u2019s central region disrupting probe-template annealing. The authors designed a replacement assay to correct this problem, but did not provide validation data documenting assay performance. These variants were discovered because the hospitalized children were routinely screened for HRSV by IFA, a method less susceptible to virus strain variation. However, routine IFA screening is impractical and would be less effective for testing adults where the method would lack the requisite sensitivity. Even with updated sequences, we also encountered a single HRSV strain that was poorly amplified with our duplex assay. Sequencing revealed a single nucleotide mismatch with the 3\u2032-end of the reverse primer. Although generally more tolerant than probes (Suss et al., 2009; Whiley and Sloots, 2005), primer mismatches can also diminish target amplification (Blais et al., 2015). Although occasional HRSV variants that elude molecular detection would not be expected to greatly impact HRSV disease burden estimates, HRSV variants can quickly replace competing strains as occurred with the novel \u201cBA\u201d virus that emerged in 1999 and is now the most common HRSV B lineage detected worldwide (Trento et al., 2003, 2006).
