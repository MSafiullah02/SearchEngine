Patients treated in the acute setting were considered theoretically infected and the necessary protective devices were used. The number of patients and the possible infection of physicians were evaluated. The number and type of interventions and the need for postoperative IC during this period were compared with those in the same periods in 2018 and 2019. Results: One hundred and fifty-one interventions were performed, of which 34 (23%) were acute/emergency. The total number of interventions was similar to those performed in the same periods in 2019 and 2018: 150 (33, of which 22% acute/emergency) and 117 (29, 25% acute/emergency), respectively. IC was necessary after 6% (17% in 2019 and 20% in 2018) of elective operations and 33% (11) of acute/emergency interventions. None of the patients treated electively were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection during hospitalisation. Of the 34 patients treated in acute/emergency interventions, five (15%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection.

In Emilia-Romagna, from 8 March to 8 April 2020, 18 000 infections were identified, with 3 750 symptomatic patients admitted to hospital and 360 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, 61% of the overall available ICU beds in the region, occupied by patients with COVID-19 ( Fig. 1 ). 2, 3 During the first month after the lockdown, all regional vascular surgery activities were limited to acute cases. Metropolitan vascular surgery in the city of Bologna, the main centre of the Emilia-Romagna region with about one million citizens, serves two tertiary hospitals, and provides service for five peripheral hospitals (Fig. 2 ). The healthcare system of the city of Bologna maintained some elective surgical activities during the pandemic emergency, such as cardiac, oncological, and vascular surgery; however, keeping patients undergoing such procedures separated from the COVID-19 patients posed a major set up challenge. In total across the city hospitals, 800 ward beds were reserved for patients with COVID-19, in addition to a total of 130 ICU beds (with a further 50",

Concerning these recommendations, the present authors have recently suggested an extensive revision of the priority scale, following current scientific evidence in particular for carotid interventions for asymptomatic patients but their treatment remains an objective for the regional health system.",

In the present series only seven elective cases required ICU, with a median stay of two days. Keeping the use of strategic resources such as ICU beds for COVID-19 patients in the pandemic period is a key element; current advances in vascular and endovascular surgery allow a very effective response to this need. 10 The present study has some limitations such as the scarce number of procedures and its retrospective nature, and moreover the present data are not associated with a control group to evaluate the real efficacy of the protocols adopted. Another element of reflection is the rate of false negative tests, which can lead to spread of the infection despite precautions.",

            "text": "a normal volume of elective activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. This work is observational and limited to a short time, however it may help planning the activity of other units at different times of contamination. The Emilia-Romagna region had the second highest number of COVID-19 infections in Italy, after Lombardia; by 8 April, the official number of patients infected was 18 000, diagnosed by 78 000 NPS, with 3 750 patients admitted to hospitals and 360 receiving intensive care. The infection mortality rate was 12%, for a total number of 2 234 deaths. 2 The availability of ICU beds in Emilia-Romagna is usually 449, with an increase to 573 (+124/ +28%) during the pandemic phase. Three hundred and sixty/573 ICU (i.e. 63% of the total) beds were for patients with COVID-19 on 8 April; fortunately, a decrease in this number began after this date. 3 The healthcare system organisation allowed maintenance of selected elective surgery activities: cancer surgery, cardiac surgery and vascular surgery for pathologies with a top priority level, as designated in nonpandemic time, with cessation of most outpatient activities and all venous surgical procedures. The metropolitan vascular surgery unit of Bologna was the only one in the region performing elective surgery, accepting patients planned for surgery at the vascular surgery unit. During a pandemic, any elective surgical activity requires specific attention to avoid patient and physician infections. The primary approach to avoid in hospital infection was to submit all prepandemic in hospital patients with history of risky contacts or symptoms to NPS, as well as all newly admitted patients. Use of isolation and protection devices for any acute/emergency surgery case and in all patients potentially contaminated prevented the spread of COVID-19 infection to other patients and to the vascular surgery team, despite six interventions (34% of acute/emergency cases) being performed on patients positive for COVID-19.Physicians were submitted to NPS only after close contact with other healthcare professionals with infection or unprotected contacts with infected patients. The need for scrupulous and constant screening of the healthcare personnel is therefore fundamental to avoid in hospital contamination.Standardisation and validation of screening criteria is of paramount importance in an ideal prevention plan.",
