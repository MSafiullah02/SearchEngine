Starting from the integrity and systematicness of interactions between drug targets and diseases, it uses computer methods to model multi-target activities on the basis of multi-level networks of diseases, genes and drugs. At the same time, it studies the biological basis of drugs acting on the body, which is a powerful tool for Mongolian medicine modernization research (Zheng and Fan, 2017). Molecular docking is a computational tool for predicting the binding ability and binding mode of proteins and ligands. Its principle is based on the \u201clock key model\u201d of the interaction between proteins and small ligands, calculating and predicting the conformation and orientation of ligands at protein active sites, so as to judge the binding degree and play an important role in the target prediction of drug organisms (Duan et al., 2019).There are many links and factors that affect the infection in SARS-CoV-2. According to previous studies, the infection routes of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are the combination of S-protein of the virus and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) in human body, which leads to the invasion of the virus into the body and causes disease (Li et al., 1864). In this study, molecular docking screening was carried out on ACE2, a key target protein in the process of virus infection, to obtain active compounds against coronavirus, providing reference for effective drug screening and new drug development.",

It is reported that residues 442, 472, 479, 487 and 491 in SARS-CoV S- protein are located at the receptor complex interface, which is considered to be essential for cross-species and human-to-human transmission (Raj et al., 2013). Compared with the SARS-CoV S-protein, the RBD domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein has been replaced with amino acid residues at positions 442, 472, 479, 487 except for Tyr491 (Figure 5-A). Substitution of residues at positions 442, 472, 479 and 487 of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein did not change its interface structure. SARS-CoV-2 S- protein and SARS-CoV S-protein have almost the same three-dimensional structure in the RBD domain, thus maintaining similar van der Waals and electrostatic characteristics in the interaction, thus SARS-CoV-2 have significant binding affinity with human ACE2 (Schwede et al., 2003). Since the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein in the RBD domain has high homology with SARS-CoV, we downloaded the sequence file (FASTA format) (PDB:6ACD) of SARS-COV S-protein using RCSD protein database(www.rcsb.org), replacing Y with L at 442, F with L at 472, C with N at 479, and N with T at 487.

The Metascape platform was used to perform GO annotation analysis and KEGG pathway analysis on the potential targets for antivirus. The threshold value P \uff1c 0.01 was set to screen out the front GO annotation results and KEGG pathway. The results are shown in Fig.2\n-B and the specific values are shown in table 3\n. The results showed that there were 20 signal pathways with high coincidence, and KEGG pathway annotation related to anti-toxic substances was selected to map the genes corresponding to the regulatory target protein directly to the pathways. The GO annotation has a large amount of data, among which, the top ones in the biological process are response to toxic substance, response to xenobiotic stimulus, Cellular Response to Nitrogen Compound. Through the enrichment analysis of KEGG pathway in Metascape database, two pathways closely related to immunity and anti-allotoxin are mainly IL-17 signaling pathway and PID ATF2 pathway. Kappa Score is an indicator of the extent to which two raters who are examining the same set of categorical data, agree and takes into account agreement occurring by chance. The nodes are connected to form a network by the similarity between terms (Kappa>0.3), and each node represents an enrichment term. The color of the node in Fig.2-C indicates the cluster to which the node belongs. It can be seen that the terms belonging to the same cluster are closer and more closely related to each other. The color of the nodes in Fig.2-D indicates the degree of enrichment (P value), and it can be seen that the more the number of genes is included, the more significant the P value is.",

Molecular docking results showed that phillyrin and Gln325 of ACE2 were mainly combined in the form of hydrogen bonds and had good binding activity, which indicated that phillyrin could hinder the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein RBD domain and ACE2 at Gln325/Glu329 , and the docking energy value was smaller and the binding was more stable. Chlorogenic acid combines with ACE2 Gln42/Asp38 in the form of hydrogen bonds. Compared with SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 binding model, the docking energy is smaller and the binding is more stable, which indicates that chlorogenic acid can hinder the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein RBD domain and ACE2 at Gln42/Asp38.

Currently, there is still a lack of specific drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, and the existing chemical drugs can only alleviate some symptoms. The development and research of new drugs based on clinical experiments are long and expensive, which is difficult to apply to clinical treatment in time. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 has high infectivity and variability. The research requires high-level laboratory conditions, which greatly limits drug screening. Therefore, computer-aided drug design has fast speed, save drug development costs, and is suitable for large-scale screening of chemical components of traditional Mongolia medicine.

In April 2018, Honeysuckle was explicitly listed in the \u201cMedicine and food homologous food\u201d catalogue by the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China. Chlorogenic acid is the main active ingredient of Mongolian medicine honeysuckle, which is an ester substance formed by caffeic acid and quinic acid. It is easy to isomerize through hydrolysis or ester group migration in the extraction process (\u5f20\u6d69\u8d85, 2017, \u8d75\u68a6\u5a07, 2016). Chlorogenic acid is very high in Eucommia ulmoides, honeysuckle, coffee bean, blueberry, apple and potato containing phenolic acids. As the main active ingredient of the Mongolian medicine honeysuckle, chlorogenic acid has been proven to have significant pharmacological effects, such as antioxidant, antitumor, hypoglycemic, anticoagulant, antiviral effects, etc (\u80e1\u5b97\u798f, 2006, \u9648\u7ecd\u534e, 2008). Studies by Wang Xuebing and others have shown that chlorogenic acid plays a significant role in preventing viral infection in the early stages of virus growth, and also has a strong inhibitory effect on porcine parvovirus, showing that chlorogenic acid has a strong antiviral effect (Xiehuang et al., 2008). In vitro antiviral experiments by Xiehuang Sheng, Lin Huang, etc. have proved that chlorogenic acid has obvious effect on herpes simplex virus I (HSV-1) infection, and can effectively prevent viral infection, and the antiviral effect increases with the increase of chlorogenic acid concentration [30]. Lijing Li and others have studied the antiviral effect of chlorogenic acid in Senecio cannabifolius, and the results showed that chlorogenic acid extracted from Senecio cannabifolius can produce better inhibitory effect on adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus (Lin et al., 2012).",

There are more than 400 Chinese and Mongolian medicine preparations involving honeysuckle-forsythia drug pairs in the existing Chinese patent medicines on the market, such as Lianqiao baidu pill, Yinhua ganmao granule, Zhizi Jinhua pill, etc (Haiqing and Jia, 2020). Meiyi Zhang et al studied the anti-H1N1 influenza virus effect of Jinqiao Tablets in vivo, and found that Jinqiao Tablets can significantly inhibit the increase of lung index in mice, reduce the viral load of lung tissue, and increase the level of \u03b3-IFN, thus having obvious therapeutic effect (Zhang et al., xxxx). Pan Qu et al. conducted in vitro studies on the anti-influenza virus effects of honeysuckle, forsythia, burdock and their extracts, which are the main drugs of Yinqiao Powder, and found that the single drugs and their compatible extracts have good anti-influenza A virus proliferation effects, and are correlated with drug concentration and duration of action (Zhang et al., 2018). Studies on the effect of honeysuckle-forsythia on respiratory syncytial virus show that Yinqiao powder has the effect of inhibiting respiratory syncytial virus, and the protective effect of drug-containing serum combined with the two drugs on cells is better than that of drug-containing serum of two single drugs (Pan et al., 2011). Yinqiao Powder can reduce the lung index of mice (Mo et al., 2005), reduce the damage of nasal mucosa epithelial cells and lung tissue. Its improvement effect on respiratory system of RSV infected mice is comparable to that of positive control drug ribavirin. In addition, in vitro cell experiments verified the improvement effect of Yinqiao Powder on RSV infection, and its mechanism of action is related to the activation of NALP3 inflammasome. An anti-RSV virus study conducted on Yinhua Ganmao Granules found that the half-toxic concentration of this preparation is 2.3937 mg / mL, the half-therapeutic concentration is 52.03 \u03bcg / mL, and the therapeutic index is 46.01, indicating that Yinhua Ganmao Granules have better inhibitory effect on RSV (Qin, 2016). In the study of antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of honeysuckle, forsythia single medicine and compatibility, Jiarui Wu et al studied the mechanism of action of honeysuckle-forsythia drug pair by network pharmacology (Wang, 2013). The diseases involved are mainly inflammatory diseases, which showed that the compatibility of the two drugs is consistent with the efficacy of clearing away heat and toxic materials. Although water decoction alone has certain anti-inflammatory effect, it has no statistical difference with the model group, and the anti-inflammatory effect is strongest when the two are used in combination at a ratio of 1:1 (Jiarui et al., 2017). For antipyretic effect, the research results showed that forsythia alone has no antipyretic effect, and the antipyretic effect of honeysuckle and forsythia 1:1 compatibility is the most obvious, the combination of the two can reduce the level of IL-6 in experimental rats and play a certain antipyretic effect (Lin et al., 2008). Animal experiments have verified that in the antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects, the combination of honeysuckle and forsythia can play a synergistic role.",
