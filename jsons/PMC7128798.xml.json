Analysis of the genomic sequence of ACE2 has revealed that the gene contains 18 exons and maps to chromosomal location Xp22 [5]. The full-length, human ACE2 cDNA predicts a protein of 805 amino acids that has 42% homology with the N-terminal catalytic domain of ACE, and a hydrophobic region near the C-terminus, which probably serves as a membrane anchor. Like ACE, ACE2 is predicted to have the topology of a type 1 membrane protein, with the catalytic domain on the extracellular surface.",

            "text": "Unlike somatic ACE, ACE2 has only one active enzymatic site and functions as a carboxypeptidase rather than a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase. Thus, ACE2 removes a single C-terminal Leu residue from Ang I to generate Ang 1\u20139, a peptide with no known function. Although ACE2 was described originally for its ability to generate Ang 1\u20139 from Ang I [4], it also degrades Ang II to the biologically active peptide, Ang 1\u20137 [9] (Figure 1). Indeed, in vitro studies indicate that the catalytic efficiency of ACE2 for Ang II is 400-fold greater than for Ang I [9], indicating that the major role for ACE2 is the conversion of Ang II to Ang 1\u20137. The potential role of Ang 1\u20137 as a cardioprotective peptide with vasodilator, anti-growth and anti-proliferative actions has been recognized relatively recently 6, 10. Taken together, the data suggest that ACE2 might function to limit the vasoconstrictor action of Ang II through its inactivation, in addition to counteracting the actions of Ang II through the formation of the agonist, Ang 1\u20137. Recent studies [11] have identified the G-protein-coupled receptor encoded by the MAS1 protooncogene, Mas, as the receptor for Ang 1\u20137 [11]. Genetic deletion of the Mas receptor abolished the binding of Ang 1\u20137 to whole mouse kidney, whereas the functional significance of Ang 1\u20137 and its receptor was demonstrated by studies showing that Mas-deficient mice could not respond with antidiuresis to Ang 1\u20137 after a water load, and that the aortas of Mas-deficient mice were unable to relax in response to Ang 1\u20137 [11].",

There has been increasing interest in peptides that are either cleaved or generated by this enzyme. In addition to effects on the angiotensin peptides, ACE2 cleaves the C-terminal residue of the peptides des-Arg9-bradykinin, neurotensin 1\u201313 and kinetensin [4], and hydrolyses apelin-13 and dynorphin A 1\u201313 with as high a catalytic efficiency as Ang II [9]. ACE2 has no effect on bradykinin, in contrast to ACE, emphasizing the specificity of ACE2 4, 9. Many of the in vitro substrates of ACE2 have actions that are relevant to cardiovascular regulation; apelin is a potent cardiac inotrope [15], dynorphin A is an endogenous opioid neuropeptide and des-Arg9-bradykinin binds to the bradykinin B1 receptor, which is activated by inflammation and tissue injury [16].",

The importance of ACE2 in cleaving and/or inactivating Ang II is indicated by the increase in plasma, cardiac and kidney Ang II levels in the Ace2-knockout animals, and confirmed by studies in which genetic ablation of Aceon an Ace2 mutant background completely rescued the cardiac phenotype [17].",

Given that marked stimulation of ACE and Ang II occurs after myocardial infarction [23], ACE2 probably increases after myocardial infarction; this increase would limit the adverse effects of raised cardiac Ang II by increasing levels of the vasodilator Ang 1\u20137. Support for this idea comes from studies in the rat myocardial infarction (MI) model, in which the development of heart failure was associated with increased Ang 1\u20137 immunoreactivity [24]. Furthermore, infusion of Ang 1\u20137 attenuated the development of heart failure after MI, confirming the functional significance of Ang 1\u20137 [25]. It is possible that the relative balance of vasoconstrictor and vasodilator angiotensin peptides is important in the modulation of both haemodynamic and trophic effects of these peptides in the context of ischaemic heart disease.",

We have recently characterized ACE2 in the kidney of a rodent model of type 1 diabetes mellitus and compared and contrasted it with ACE [26]. Previous studies in the kidney using this model of diabetes demonstrated that ACE is downregulated in the renal tubules and upregulated in the glomerulus. In a recent study, we found that both ACE and ACE2 mRNA levels were decreased in diabetic renal tubules by \u223c50%. We also found that ACE2 protein synthesis is reduced in the diabetic kidney, and this reduction is prevented by ACE inhibitor therapy, suggesting that ACE2 might have a renoprotective role in diabetes [28]. Although there have been no other studies on the expression of ACE2 after renal tissue injury, the synthesis of collectrin, a protein with significant homology to ACE2 is upregulated in a model of progressive renal injury [29].",

These beneficial results are thought to result from blocking the vasoconstrictor, hypertrophic and proinflammatory actions of Ang II. The discovery of a new enzyme in the RAS pathway, ACE2, which produces the vasodilatory and antihypertrophic peptide Ang 1\u20137, gives rise to the hypothesis that ACE2 provides a counter-regulatory system to Ang II, which might also contribute to the beneficial effects of RAS blockade.",
