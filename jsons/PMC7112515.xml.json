Even if prophylaxis or treatments were effective, they would likely be in short supply5.

When SARS first emerged in China, it was thought to be little more than a severe strain of influenza. Eventually this diagnosis was changed to that of \u2018atypical\u2019 pneumonia. Even as more patients sought medical care for fever associated with shortness of breath, no definitive diagnosis was made. Then SARS spread across the world to Scarborough Grace hospital in Toronto. There, the staff was relatively unprepared for such a virulent virus, and SARS spread throughout the city. In the coming months, the virus had a severe impact on both the Canadian health system and economy. The outbreaks of this mysterious disease led to public fear and panic since no one understood the cause of SARS or the method or degree of transmission. The only effective mechanism for containment was quarantine.",

The lost productivity associated with the outbreaks was calculated, in terms of wages.

Then, we calculated the cost of infection for the index case and the people who were infected by him or her. It is important to note that although the index case was quarantined, a subset of people was infected since the virus probably was not identified and isolated before the patient became symptomatic. During this time, the patient was contagious and likely had contact with a number of people. However, once the infectious disease has been identified, all of the contacts of the index case should be quarantined. In the event that any of the quarantined individuals contract the virus, they would be isolated from the public and the virus would be contained. After calculating the costs of infection for a given number of people, we then subtract this figure from the aggregate cost of letting the virus spread unchecked to the maximum number of people. We then compare the cost of infection to the cost of quarantine.

In order to assign economic value to each year of life, we examined the average wage of a worker in Ontario as a proxy for productivity. This yields an average of $30 702 lost per life year per worker. Therefore, mortality related to SARS results in a loss of productivity valued at approximately $460 530 per life lost.
