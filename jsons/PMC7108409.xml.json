While a desire for faster, better and cheaper results continually provides an impetus for new test development, an improvement in one arena often yields shortcomings in another. Thus, laboratory directors face difficult decisions regarding assay implementation for which numerous factors need be considered, not the least of which is the overall impact on patient care.",

            "text": "With respect to diagnostic testing for pathogenic respiratory viruses, cell culture (CC) has traditionally been considered the gold standard reference method (Yolken et al., 2003). One major disadvantage to this approach, however, is the extended incubation period often required for virus isolation, such that results are unavailable to clinicians during the initial stages of patient management (Shetty et al., 2003). Additional tests including enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), immunofluorescence (IF) assays and other direct antigen tests (DAT) (Johnston and Siegel, 1990, Reina et al., 2004, Shetty et al., 2003, Weinberg and Walker, 2005), shell vial techniques (Engler and Preuss, 1997, Schirm et al., 1992) and nucleic acid amplification tests (Kehl et al., 2001, Templeton et al., 2004, Weinberg et al., 2004b) have all been introduced into the viral diagnostic armamentarium with the logical rationale that more rapid detection may favorably influence patient management, leading to reductions in antibiotic usage, shorter and less costly hospitalizations with fewer extraneous laboratory tests ordered, better cohorting capabilities and infection control measures, and better utilization of anti-viral therapies. A number of investigations have addressed one or more of these issues directly, each having employed some DAT as the methodological basis by which patient outcome comparisons were made (Adcock et al., 1997, Barenfanger et al., 2000, Byington et al., 2002, Noyola and Demmler, 2000, Woo et al., 1997).",

Yet many clinical laboratories are not equipped with this capability at present. Direct antigen tests are inexpensive relative to PCR and offer the benefit of simplicity and very short turnaround times.

Sensitivity/NPV for the detection of RSV by R-mix\u2122 was significantly higher than by CC (73%/95.8% and 42%/91.5%, respectively; p\n = 0.0001); and mean TTD of all RSV positive specimens by R-mix\u2122 shell vial assay was 1.2 days compared to 8.0 days required by CC. On the other hand, DAT identified 72/72 RSV-positive samples (20 by EIA, 52 by DFA), resulting in a significantly greater sensitivity/NPV for RSV (100%/100%) than for either CC or R-mix\u2122 (p\n < 0.0001). In addition, all results were reported within 24 h of specimen processing. Sensitivity/NPV for the detection of adenovirus was significantly higher by CC than by R-mix\u2122 (100%/100% and 45%/96.9%, respectively; p\n < 0.0001), while mean TTD by CC was 4.8 days versus 1.4 days by R-mix\u2122. Interestingly, CC required an average of 2.6 days for isolation of the 14 adenovirus strains detected by the R-mix\u2122 system, whereas mean TTD for the other 17 isolates (identified by CC only) was 6.7 days. Sensitivity/NPV for the detection of all parainfluenza isolates was 87%/99.4% by CC and 83%/99.2% by R-mix\u2122. These differences (as well as differences between detection of individual serotypes) were not significant. Additionally, 23 picornavirus isolates and 16 herpesvirus isolates were recovered by CC only (Table 2\n).",

Of 468 such cultures, 6 (1.3%) and 21 (4.5%) were positive for RSV and influenza A/B, respectively, by either R-mix\u2122 or CC (Table 3\n). When analyzed in this fashion, no statistical differences in sensitivity between R-mix\u2122 and CC for the detection of RSV or influenza A/B were noted. Mean TTD by R-mix\u2122 remained shorter than by CC, averaging 3.2 and 8.6 days faster for influenza A/B and RSV, respectively. Had this culture protocol been in place during the study period, however, the overall detection rate by either CC or R-mix\u2122 would have been effectively reduced. As illustrated in Fig. 1\n, the relative proportions of viruses detected by culture alone would have differed in comparison with the proportions detected by all three methodologies. As a result, while RSV, influenza A/B and parainfluenza 1\u20133 comprise 67% of the total number of viruses detected by all methods (Fig. 1A), they represent only 44% of viruses detected by culture alone (Fig. 1B). Put differently, specimens for which culture would have been the sole manner of virus detection (e.g. DAT negative or DAT not requested) gave similar overall positivity rates for RSV (5/468; 1.1%), HSV (5/468; 1.1%) and CMV (11/468; 2.4%) as well as for influenza A/B (21/468; 4.5%), picornaviruses (23/468; 4.9%), adenovirus (31/468; 6.6%) and parainfluenza 1-3 (23/468; 4.9%) (Fig. 1B).",

Given the two culture protocols used in this study, we found negligible differences in set-up times (e.g. specimen processing, inoculations, centrifugation steps, etc.) and baseline material costs (i.e. cell monolayers/shell vials) between the two culture methodologies. The primary differences in cost were noted in immunofluorescent reagents and overall technologist time. We calculated having spent approximately $12,000 for R-mix\u2122 ($21 per specimen) and approximately $3000 for CC ($5 per specimen) on immune reagents over the entire study period. This was partially compensated for by savings in technologist time\u2014\u223c0.37 h per specimen for R-mix\u2122 versus \u223c1.02 h per specimen for CC, representing a difference of $13 per specimen based upon a $20 h\u22121 salary.

When compared with DAT, however, neither R-mix\u2122 nor CC provided as sensitive or as timely results, suggesting that DAT should remain the test of choice for RSV at our institution. Given the liability of RSV and prior reports demonstrating that DAT frequently detects uncultivable RSV (Johnston and Siegel, 1990, Kellogg, 1991), we have no reason to doubt that most RSV-positive samples detected by DAT alone were actually true positives. Indeed, other investigations of the R-mix\u2122 system have illustrated the benefits of DAT for RSV detection (Dunn et al., 2004, Fong et al., 2000). Yet given the possibility that a small number of RSV-positive samples detected only by DAT may have been falsely positive, we cannot rule out having slightly underestimated the sensitivity for RSV detection by CC and SV. Additionally, because pediatric-aged patients (a) were overrepresented in our data, and (b) have been shown to harbor higher RSV titers and, hence, test positive by DAT more frequently than adults (Kellogg, 1991), we cannot draw conclusions from the present study regarding appropriate testing for RSV in the adult population.",

Potentially significant reductions in mean TTD were achieved without any appreciable compromise in sensitivity (Table 2). Surprisingly, comparison of sensitivity for influenza A/B by DAT and either culture methodology revealed no statistical differences. Because influenza virus is not generally considered to be as labile as RSV, a scenario wherein DAT is the sole positive assay for this virus seems somewhat less likely. Review of our data indicated that 5 of 15 DATs positive for influenza A/B (all of which were performed by EIA) were unconfirmed by either culture method. While we speculate that some of these results may have been falsely positive (and therefore decreased the calculated sensitivity of both culture systems), supplemental testing (e.g. RT-PCR) and/or detailed information (e.g. duration between DAT and culture set-up), which might have corroborated this suspicion, were not readily available.",

Reports by Huang and Turchek (2000) and St. George et al. (2002) demonstrated similar detection rates and analytical sensitivity for adenovirus isolates between R-mix\u2122 shell vials harvested 24 h post-inoculation as compared to other 24-h shell vial or conventional CC methods. However, the two studies utilized (a) stored patient samples that had previously tested positive by IFA or (b) dilutions of passaged virus. By contrast, two prospective studies using fresh, non-passaged patient samples reported low sensitivity rates for adenovirus similar to the present study\u2014namely 69% and 25% based on 51 and 16 isolates, respectively (Dunn et al., 2004, Weinberg et al., 2004a). These authors concluded that abbreviated incubation periods (24 h) or differing inoculum volumes (0.2 mL versus 0.3 mL) may have accounted for their observed low sensitivity values. Yet these variables cannot account for our observed adenovirus sensitivity, as we (a) extended the incubation period of R-mix\u2122 shell vials to 48 h and (b) used identical inoculum volumes of each specimen for CC and R-mix\u2122. Still, the lower sensitivity observed in R-mix\u2122 could have been due to low viral titers in some samples, particularly given the mean TTD by CC for the 17 samples not detected by R-mix\u2122 (6.7 days). In that case, extended incubation of shell vials beyond 48 h may have resulted in an increased recovery rate, although this seems to us to defeat the overall purpose of shell vial techniques. Lastly, because different antibody reagents were utilized for R-mix\u2122 screen/confirmation (D3, DHI) and CC confirmation (Bartels, Trinity Biotech), we cannot exclude the unlikely possibility that differences in observed adenovirus sensitivity between the two culture systems were partly attributable to inherent antigen specificities between the virus-specific monoclonal antibodies.",

As the virus season progressed, staff became more attuned to the fact that weak positivity on screening often did not confirm. A minor modification of the SV protocol was instituted so that confirmation of weakly positive screens from day 1 was postponed until day 2. Indeed, the number of equivocal samples at 24-h decreased as the study progressed, and we were able to confirm six virus-positive samples on day 2 that may have otherwise gone undetected by R-mix\u2122.

We found that the overall cost of the R-mix\u2122 system using the described protocol was only slightly higher (\u223c$4 per sample) than our current CC protocol after taking into consideration the marked reduction in labor required by the former (\u223c300% average reduction/specimen). As with other shell vial systems, additional advantages included simplicity of the methodology and less dependence on experience in discerning CPE. Importantly, our cost estimates were based upon an \u201call or nothing\u201d scenario (i.e. CC alone versus R-mix\u2122 alone). As a result, implementation of R-mix\u2122 with retention of some CC capabilities would have served to increase the overall cost of the \u201cR-mix\u2122 approach\u201d.",

For RSV, the R-mix\u2122 system is significantly more sensitive and more timely than CC, but neither appears to offers diagnostic benefit over DAT. The sensitivity of R-mix\u2122 for adenovirus detection in clinical material is significantly lower than that of CC. Finally, while technical and logistical advantages of the R-mix\u2122 system exist, alternative methodologies must remain in place if identification of other recognized viral respiratory pathogens, including CMV, HSV and picornaviruses is desired.",
