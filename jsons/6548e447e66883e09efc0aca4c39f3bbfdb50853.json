The 17 human AdV (HAdV) species B and C, such as HAdV-C2, C5 and B14, cause respiratory 18 disease, and constitute a health threat for immuno-compromised individuals. HAdV-Cs are 19 well known for lysing cells, owing to the E3 CR1-\u03b2-encoded adenovirus death protein 20 (ADP). We previously reported a high-throughput image-based screening framework and 21 identified an inhibitor of HAdV-C2 multi-round infection, Nelfinavir Mesylate. Nelfinavir is 22 the active ingredient of Viracept, an FDA-approved inhibitor of the human immuno-23 deficiency virus (HIV) aspartyl protease, and used to treat acquired immunodeficiency 24 syndrome (AIDS). It is not effective against single round HAdV infections. Here, we show 25 that Nelfinavir inhibits the lytic cell-free transmission of HAdV, indicated by the 26 suppression of comet-shaped infection foci in cell culture. Comet-shaped foci occur upon 27",

HAdV lacking ADP was insensitive to Nelfinavir, but gave 29 rise to comet-shaped foci indicating that ADP enhances but is not required for cell lysis. 30 This was supported by the notion that HAdV-B14 and B14p1 lacking ADP were highly 31 sensitive to Nelfinavir, although HAdV-A31, B3, B7, B11, B16, B21, D8, D30 or D37 were 32 less sensitive. Conspicuously, Nelfinavir uncovered slow-growing round-shaped HAdV-C2 33 foci, independent of neutralizing antibodies in the medium, indicative of non-lytic cell-to-34 cell transmission. Our study demonstrates the repurposing potential of Nelfinavir with 35 post-exposure efficacy against different HAdVs, and describes an alternative non-lytic cell-36 to-cell transmission mode of HAdV. 37 Graphical Abstract 38 39 40",

More than 100 human AdV (HAdV) genotypes 44 have since been characterized by molecular genetics or serology and grouped into seven species 45 (Harrach et . The N-terminus of ADP is lumenal and the C-terminus protrudes into the cytosol 114 . Following post-translational modifications, ADP is transported to the inner 115 nuclear membrane, where the N-terminus is intruding into the nucleus (Georgi and Greber, 116 submitted). At late stages, when capsid assembly in the nucleus has commenced ADP expression 117 is boosted Wold et al., 1984 Here, we report that Nelfinavir is an effective inhibitor of HAdV lytic egress. The identification 122 process of Nelfinavir is described in an accompanying paper using an imaging-based, high 123 content screen of the Prestwick Chemical Library (PCL) comprising 1,280 mostly clinical or 124 preclinical compounds (Georgi et al., 2020; Yakimovich et al., 2015) .

The work here documents the repurposing 127 potential of Nelfinavir, which is effective against a spectrum of HAdV types in a post exposure 128 manner. Nelfinavir is partly, but not exclusively, active against ADP-encoding HAdV types, and 129",

            "text": "al., 2019; Ismail et al., 2019). HAdV species A, F and G replicate in the gastrointestinal 46 tract, B, C and E in the respiratory organs, and B and D in conjunctival cells of the eyes. Species 47 B members have a broad tropism, including kidney and cells of the hematopoietic lineage (Lion, 48 2019; Lynch and Kajon, 2016; Mei et al., 2002). HAdV-caused illness can range from asympto-49 matic to lethal, especially in immunocompromised individuals (Bailey et al., 2018; Greber et al., 502013;Krilov, 2005). HAdV outbreaks are frequent in military training camps, but also nursery 51 homes, as recorded in recurrent outbreaks of HAdV-E4 and HAdV-B7 (Erdman et al., 2002; 52 Hwang et al., 2013; Lynch and Kajon, 2016; Potter et al., 2012; State of New Jersey Department 53 of Health, 2019). To counter the disease burden, an oral HAdV-E4/B7 vaccine was reintroduced, 54 leading to a sharp decline in adenoviral disease among military recruits (Deal et al., 2013; Lynch 55 and Kajon, 2016; Radin et al., 2014). In addition to recurrent HAdV outbreaks, novel HAdV 56variants emerge, some of them causing pneumonia and death of elderly with chronic diseases. 57One of these emerging HAdVs is the HAdV-B14 variant 14p1, also known as 14a(Carr et al., 58 2011; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2007; Lam et al., 2015; Louie et al., 59 2008; O'Flanagan et al., 2011). Furthermore, AdVs have a potential for zoonotic transmission 60 (Benk\u0151 et al., 2014). Cross-species infections to humans from either non-human primates or 61 psittacine birds have been reported from the USA and China, respectively (Chen et al., 2011b; 62 To et al., 2014). Despite the high prevalence (Gray et al., 2007; Haque et al., 2018; Lynch and 63 Kajon, 2016; Metzgar et al., 2007) and the broad use of AdV as gene therapy vectors (Ginn et al., 64 2018) as well as oncolytic viruses (Jiang et al., 2015; Lawler et al., 2017) no FDA-approved 65 specific anti-HAdV treatment is available to date. Clinically, HAdV infections are treated with 66 Ribavirin, Cidofovir, or more recently, Brincidofovir, which all inhibit viral DNA replication 67 (Hiwarkar et al., 2017; Wold et al., 2019). 68 69 HAdV particles have been well characterized. They have a double-stranded DNA genome of ~36 70 kilo base pairs (kbp) packaged into an icosahedral capsid of about 90 nm in diameter (Benevento 71 et al., 2014; Flatt and Greber, 2017; Liu et al., 2010; Reddy et al., 2010). HAdV-C2 and C5 72 replication cycle has been extensively studied including entry, uncoating, replication, assembly 73 and egress from the infected cell (Allen and Byrnes, 2019; Atasheva et al., 2019; Charman et al., 74 2019; Greber, 2002; Greber and Flatt, 2019; Hidalgo et al., 2019; Kleinberger, 2019; Lynch et al., 75 2019; Nemerow and Flint, 2019; Oliveira and Bouvier, 2019; Pied and Wodrich, 2019; 76 Prusinkiewicz and Mymryk, 2019; Sohn and Hearing, 2019; Suomalainen and Greber, 2013; 77 Wang et al., 2018). HAdV-C infects cells by binding to the coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor 78 (CAR) and integrin co-receptors, followed by receptor-mediated endocytosis, endosomal lysis 79 and microtubule-motor driven transport to the nucleus, where it uncoats DNA and delivers the 80 DNA into the nucleus (Bauer et al., 2019; Bremner et al., 2009; Burckhardt et al., 2011; Gastaldelli 81 et al., 2008; Leopold et al., 2000; Luisoni et al., 2015; Meier and Greber, 2004; Suomalainen and 82 Greber, 2013; Suomalainen et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2017; Wiethoff et al., 2005; Wolfrum and 83 Greber, 2013; Zhou et al., 2018). The first viral protein expressed is E1A, a multifunctional 84 intrinsically disordered protein controlling the transcriptional activity of all AdVs, as well as many 85 cellular promoters, thereby affecting the cell cycle, differentiation, transformation and apoptosis 86 (Berk, 2005; Ferrari et al., 2008; King et al., 2018; Pelka et al., 2008; Rao et al., 1992; Zemke and 87 Berk, 2017). Viral early proteins besides E1A mediate immune escape, block activation of pro-88 apoptotic pathways and form nuclear viral DNA replication compartments. Late viral proteins give 89 rise to mature progeny virions upon limited proteolysis of capsid proteins by the viral cysteine 90 protease L3/p23 (Ahi and Mittal, 2016; Greber, 1998; Mangel and San Mart\u00edn, 2014). Mature 91 HAdV progeny is released upon rupture of the nuclear envelope and plasma membrane, which 92 facilitates rapid viral dissemination and plaque formation in vitro (Doronin et al., 2003; Tollefson 93 et al., 1996a; Yakimovich et al., 2012). The convection forces in the medium give rise to comet-94 shaped infection foci in cell cultures (Yakimovich et al., 2012). Foci of infected cells are also found 95 in tissue, such as rat liver upon intravenous inoculation of HAdV-C5 (Haisma et al., 2008). 96 Accordingly, acute HAdV infections trigger an inflammatory response, as shown in airways or 97 conjunctiva of susceptible animals (Ismail et al., 2019; Kajon et al., 2003). In contrast to lytic virus 98 transmission, direct cell-to-cell transmission leads to round plaques, as shown with vaccinia virus 99 (Beerli et al., 2019; Doceul et al., 2010; Roberts and Smith, 2008; Zhong et al., 2013). 100 101 The mechanisms of virus transmission are highly virus-specific. They comprise non-lytic pathways 102 involving the secretory-endocytic circuits, multi-vesicular or autophagic membrane processes, 103 cellular protrusions, or transient breaches of membrane integrity (Burckhardt and Greber, 2009; 104 Jansens et al., 2020; Mothes et al., 2010; van der Grein et al., 2018; Zhong et al., 2013). In 105 contrast, lytic egress pathways further involve the destabilization of cellular membranes by viral 106 and host factors, often tuned by the cytoskeleton (Danthi, 2016; Madan et al., 2008; Scott and 107 Griffin, 2015; Wang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). HAdV-C2 controls lytic cell death by the 108 adenovirus death protein (ADP), also known as 11.6K, as concluded from genetic and 109 overexpression studies (Doronin et al., 2003; Tollefson et al., 1996a). ADP is a type III membrane 110 protein transcribed from the CR1-\u03b2 region in the immuno-regulatory E3a locus. All HAdV-C 111 members harbour homologous E3a CR1-\u03b2 sequences (e.g. 10.5K in HAdV-C5). Other HAdV 112 species differ in their E3 region, however (Davison et al., 2003a; Dhingra et al., 2019; Robinson 113 et al., 2013)",

Nelfinavir was reported to inhibit the activity of regulatory proteases in 647 the Golgi, the growth of cancer cells and to induce a wealth of other effects, including autophagy, 648 ER stress, the unfolded protein response, and apoptosis (Caron et al., 2003; Chow et al., 2006; 649 Gills et al., 2007; Guan et al., 2011, 2012, 2015; Yang et al., 2005) (reviewed in Bernstein and 650 Dennis, 2008; Br\u00fcning et al., 2010; Chow et al., 2009; Koltai, 2015; Shim and Liu, 2014). 651 652 Here, we demonstrate that Nelfinavir inhibits the egress of HAdV particles without perturbing other 653 viral replication steps including entry, assembly and maturation. Morphometric analyses of the 654 fluorescent plaques indicated that HAdV-C propagates by two distinct mechanisms, lytic and non-655 lytic. Lytic transmission led to comet-shaped convection driven plaques, whereas non-lytic trans-656 mission gave rise to symmetric round-shaped plaques. Nelfinavir specifically suppressed the lytic 657 spread of HAdV, most prominently the HAdV-C types and B14, but not other HAdV, such as A31 658 or D37. Incidentally, HAdV-C and B14 replicate to considerable levels in Syrian hamsters, where-659 as other HAdV types do not (Radke et al., 2016; Tollefson et al., 2017; Wold et al., 2019). We 660 infer that lytic infection could be a pathogenicity driver, at least in the hamster model. 661 662 The molecular mechanisms underlying cell lysis in AdV infection are not well understood, largely 663 due to the lack of specific assays and inhibitors. Single cell analyses combined with machine 664 learning start to identify specific features of lytic cells, such as increased intra-nuclear pressure 665 compared to non-lytic cells (Andriasyan et al., 2019). The lysis induced by HAdV was suggested 666 to involve caspase-dependent functions, and necrosis-like features (Abou El Hassan et al., 2004; 667 Yun et al., 2005; Zou et al., 2004). The best characterized factor in HAdV cell lysis is ADP, a small 668 membrane protein encoded in HAdV-C (Davison et al., 2003a, 2003b; Robinson et al., 2013).669",

            "text": "697 chondrial proton gradients (Fonseca et al., 2012; Jurgeit et al., 2012). 698 699 We noticed that ADP is not the sole lysis factor of HAdV. HAdV types lacking ADP, such as B 700 types, also release their progeny by lysis, albeit with efficacies that vary depending on the cell 701 type (Baker et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2011a; Uchino et al., 2014). This is in agreement with the 702observation that HAdV types of the A, B and D species form comet-shaped plaques, and that 703 ADP-deleted HAdV-C2 lyse the host cell, and form comet-shaped plaques, albeit delayed and 704with lower efficacy than ADP-containing rec700 or HAdV-C2-dE3B-GFP. 705706In addition to providing a new inhibitor of lytic HAdV propagation, Nelfinavir revealed an alternative 707 non-lytic HAdV transmission pathway, which gives rise to slow-growing symmetrical plaques. This 708 non-lytic pathway exists in unperturbed cells, but is camouflaged by the rapid and far-reaching 709 lytic infection. Non-lytic egress from the nucleus bypasses the nuclear envelope and the plasma 710 membrane. We speculate that the non-lytic pathway involves sorting of HAdV particles to 711 membrane sites where outward budding and scission occur. HAdV budding through the nuclear 712 envelope could involve the WASH complex, akin to nuclear release of large RNPs in Drosophila, 713andperhaps similar to HSV budding (Hagen et al., 2015; Verboon et al., 2019). Cytoplasmic 714 membrane budding could be enhanced by the ESCRT complex, which is known to release 715 enveloped viruses, such as HIV, and also facultative-enveloped viruses, such as hepatitis A virus 716 (Feng et al., 2013; Hurley, 2015; Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 2017). Alternatively, autophagy could 717 sequester virions from the nucleus and upon fusion with the plasma membrane release virions 718 from infected cell. 719 In conclusion, our work opens new therapeutic options for treating adenovirus disease, including 721 acute and persistent infections. For example, HAdV-C persists in lymphocytes, which resist lytic 722 infection, but also in epithelial cell lines under the repression of interferon and activation of the 723 unfolded protein response sensor IRE-1a (Garnett et al., 2002; Kosulin et al., 2016; Murali et al., 724 2014; Prasad et al., 2014, 2020b; Zheng et al., 2016). Nelfinavir might be considered for anti-725 HAdV therapy, for example prophylactically in hematopoietic stem cell recipients, whose life is 726 threatened by reactivation of HAdV-C (Hiwarkar et al., 2018; Lion, 2019; Lynch and Kajon, 2016). 727 Contributions 728 UFG, VA and AY conceived the project.

Cells were incubated with 383 an inoculum ranging between 10 -2,560 pfu / well HAdV-C2-dE3B-GFP for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Cells 384were washed with PBS and 100 \u00b5l DMEM phenol-free medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 385Waltham, USA), supplemented with 1% penicillin streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), 386 1% L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), 7.5% FBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad USA), 1% non-387 essential amino acids (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), 1% 100 mM sodium pyruvate (Thermo 388 Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), 0.25 ng / ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) 389 and 1 \u00b5g / ml propidium iodide (PI, Molecular Probes, Eugene, USA). Plates were imaged at the 390 indicated times pi on an IXM-C automated high-throughput fluorescence microscope (Molecular 391Devices, San Jose, USA) using a 40x objective (NA 0.95) at confocal mode (62 \u00b5m pinhole). DAPI 392 channel was acquired for nuclear Hoechst staining, FITC / GFP channel was acquired for viral 393 GFP and Cy5 channel was acquired for PI signal. 30 z steps with 0.5 \u00b5m step size were acquired 394for each channel and maximal projections were calculated. 395Plaques were segmented in Plaque2.0(Yakimovich et al., 2015) and plaque region eccentricity 398was measured as fraction of the distance between the two focal points of the ellipse divided by 399 the length of the major axis. Only plaque regions consisting of at least five infected cells 400(\u22656,000 px 2 ) with a centroid located 600 px from the well rim were considered to exclude spatial 401limitations. Plaque roundness was calculated as 1-eccentricity (Equation 1). 402Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad (GraphPad Software, Inc, version 8.1.2) using 404 the non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. 405Confocal microscopy of ADP localization 407Infection and immunofluorescence stainings were performed as described under Microscopic 408plaque assay with a cell seeding density of 3,000 cells / well. Cells were incubated with 1:1,000 409 rabbit \u03b1-HAdV-C2-ADP87-101 antibody and subsequently stained using 410 donkey \u03b1-rabbit-AlexaFluor594 (21207, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) and 0.2 \u00b5g/ml 411 NHS ester (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA) for whole cell outline. Plates were imaged on an 412IXM-C automated high-throughput fluorescence microscope (Molecular Devices, San Jose, USA) 413 using a 40x objective (NA 0.95) at confocal mode (62 \u00b5m pinhole). DAPI channel was acquired 414for nuclear Hoechst staining, FITC / GFP channel was acquired for viral GFP, TRITC / Texas red 415 channel was acquired for immunofluorescence ADP staining and Cy5 channel was acquired for 416 NHS ester signal. 30 z steps with 0.5 \u00b5m step size were acquired for each channel and maximal 417 projections were calculated. Image analysis was performed using CellProfiler(Carpenter et al.,  418  2006). Nuclei and whole cell areas were segmented based on thresholded Hoechst and NHS 419 ester signal, respectively. Nuclear rim was defined as 10 pixel-wide area around the nuclear 420border. Infected cells were classified based on the whole cell 5% quantile GFP intensity. Whole 421 cell and nuclear rim mean TRITC / Texas red (detecting ADP) intensities as well as whole cell 5-422pixel granularity per infected cell were normalized by the according mean over all infected cells 423of the solvent control.
