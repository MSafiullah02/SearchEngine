Complexity is a characteristic of large scale events, but also manifests in routine disasters such as floods, tornados, outbreaks and hazmat events that occur more frequently. All these events present high levels of uncertainty and require collaborative action between multiple sectors, which are part of complex adaptive systems (Ansell, Boin, & Keller, 2010; Okros, Verdun, & Chouinard, 2011; Wyche, Pfefferbaum, Pfefferbaum, & Norris, 2011).",

This theory has been useful in the analysis of complex adaptive systems, such as health care organizations, providing knowledge to assist with policy development, and design of information technology and work environments that support nonlinear processes that characterize the provision of patient care (Burns, 2001; Coiera, 2011). Systems characterized by change, particularly those crossing jurisdictional boundaries, cannot be analyzed without consideration of the dynamic context influencing operations (Ansell et al., 2010; Cilliers, 1998). The complexity frame of reference recognizes the interactions among system components, and between a given system and the larger environment (Coiera, 2011), and is now recognized as an essential lens for disaster management and resilience-oriented development (Kahan, Allen, George, & Thompson, 2009).",

The 2010 earthquake in Haiti exemplifies this. The acute response spanned several months, yet recovery will continue for years, and will continue to require extensive collaboration between Haitian and international agencies to develop the infrastructure to promote population health and resilience in the country. Likewise, following the relatively short response phase for the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), recovery and planning efforts to prepare for the next global outbreak have been ongoing for nearly a decade (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2009; Reissman, Watson, Klomp, Tanielian, & Prior, 2006; World Health Organization [WHO], 2009).",

Discussions of systems of critical infrastructure tend to focus on securing and protecting hard capital resources, such as facilities, supplies (e.g. vaccines), technology, and equipment. Recognition of soft capital (e.g. people and knowledge) has been slower, and there is a need for deeper understanding of the dynamics of critical social infrastructure and how it influences community capacity. Several authors have recognized this gap and suggest more empirical studies focused on social infrastructure such as communication networks, social capital, collaboration and community engagement, and methods for evaluating resilience-oriented intervention activities which focus on soft infrastructure are needed (Chandra et al., 2011; Sherrieb, Norris, & Galea, 2010; Wyche et al., 2011).",

First, disaster management, which is dynamic and adaptive, involves cross boundary integration and a diverse mix of people. Second, previous literature has expanded our understanding of the complexity of disasters, but few studies have examined empirically what the necessary ingredients for crisis management are at the grass roots, micro level, and how dynamic elements of critical social infrastructure influence community capacity. This gap in the literature is particularly apparent with respect to protecting and promoting the health of high risk populations, who are people at heightened risk for negative impacts from a crisis, due to the intersection of the social determinants of health (O'Sullivan & Bourgoin, 2010). These groups are reliant on community supports for activities of daily living, and when these supports are compromised, high risk populations, particularly people with complex medical needs, are at even greater risk for health and social problems, which create additional demands for health and social services.",

However many interventions focus on macro outcomes, without relating to the complexity of inputs at the micro level, and there is a lack of emphasis on upstream initiatives to address the complexity. Mapping of hard and soft system infrastructure, and how they contribute to managing uncertainty in disaster management, is a gap that has not been adequately addressed in the literature. We suggest the development of resilience-oriented interventions requires unpacking of the complexity at the micro level, and that interventions must emerge from the underlying complex structure including dynamic organizations, processes, technology and people; therefore an essential first step is to model the complexity inherent in the social infrastructure of a community.",

Additional recruitment techniques involved snowball sampling as the community members became aware of the sessions and disseminated information through their networks. Broad inclusion criteria ensured representation from different sectors, and fostered inclusion of community groups representing high risk populations. In each community there was representation from municipal or regional emergency management, public health, tri-services (e.g. fire, police, paramedic), emergency service organizations, food banks, and associations which advocate or provide direct care for people with disabilities. Multi-generational representatives from high risk groups participated in the focus groups, including stroke survivors and their family caregivers, several people who are hard-of-hearing or Deaf, people with low (or no) vision, and people who use assistive devices, such as a cane, wheelchair or service animal. The focus groups were conducted in English in three communities and French for the other two. Sign interpreters were provided for participants from the Deaf community and notetakers were provided for people with limited vision or fine motor control, to ensure they could participate.

The participant who is the interviewer writes down the response in the form of field notes, whereas the participant being interviewed voices his/her thoughts about the question without the pressure of speaking in front of the whole group. The process is repeated until each participant has interviewed one person from each of the other tables and also responded to the questions from each table. The facilitator guides the group so participants know how to proceed through the matrix. Following the interview matrix, the participants return to their assigned table for the small group deliberation phase, to review and summarize the data from the interviews. Data during this phase is in the form of conversations as the people at each table discuss the responses they received to their question during the interview phase.

The questions were informed by the CMIST functional needs framework (Kailes & Enders, 2007). Sample questions included: \u201cWhat are the strengths/assets/resources within your community that contribute to preparedness for, response to, and recovery from a disaster?\u201d (the same question was asked in relation to weaknesses/vulnerabilities) and \u201cIn a disaster in your community, what supports and challenges would appear for people who have limited ability to communicate (due to disabilities affecting communication, being socially isolated, or communication technology being down)?\u201d",

However, to align with the predominant themes which endorse efforts to foster connectedness and draw on the expertise in the community, inclusivity must be front and center when fine tuning the invitation list for collaborative planning activities, to ensure high risk populations are represented and their functional needs are acknowledged.",

These examples underscore the need to consider how the impact of massive demands on the acute health care system radiate into other parts of the health sector where service delivery is provided, including public health and home care, as well as occupational health and safety, employee assistance programs, and other sectors which ultimately influence population health. There is extensive literature on the need for coordination and collaboration for unified, comprehensive response to disasters, and national frameworks for disaster response acknowledge the need for multi-sector engagement and action. Population health and resilience requires collaboration between multi-disciplinary sectors, to ensure there is adequate surge capacity, as well as efficient and effective communication, particularly when infrastructure and operating systems are disrupted (Chandra et al., 2011; FEMA, 2008; Okros et al., 2011; WHO, 2009).",

Coordinated plans provide structure to consider the possible scenarios and response strategies, however flexibility is essential because self-organization, a central tenet of complexity theory, is often what evolves during a disaster when the context changes quickly (Norris et al., 2008). Action recommendations from our study, supported by the literature, include interventions designed to facilitate open-minded, pliable contingency planning, to ensure organizational adaptive capacity (Cilliers & Preiser, 2010; Kahan et al., 2009). Wyche et al. (2011) emphasized the role of flexible protocols in the provision of support for people evacuated after Hurricane Katrina. The responders were empowered when they were able to appropriately bend protocols to meet the immediate needs of the survivors and adapt to the emergent issues that arose in the shelters. In the context of pandemic, the WHO (2009) recommends contingency planning include designating and training alternate people for critical positions in any organization, to ensure back-up is available to sustain operations.

This finding is consistent with previous studies (Chandra et al., 2011; Norris et al., 2008) emphasizing organizational and individual linkages as key components of community resilience. Our results underscore the need for possibility thinking, to allow organizations to dismantle silos, create functional and informational linkages, and cross boundaries more easily to manage the dynamic context during a disaster.",

This is consistent with the findings from Chandra et al. (2011) suggesting engagement and partnerships are critical for community resilience, but that opportunities to engage in resilience-oriented activities are limited. Part of the complexity of fostering collaborative activities is the culture clash between different sectors and organizations, which McConnell and Drennan (2006) describe as institutional fragmentation. The expense and logistics of engaging a wide variety of organizations create additional barriers, yet interventions which foster collaborative activities can be useful for sharing information, social learning, and building collaborative relationships (Carroll et al., 2009; Kuziemsky & Varpio, 2010).",

Second, recruitment for this study was broad, including participants in full time paid positions with extensive expertise in emergency management, as well as volunteers and employees from community organizations with little to no experience with disaster planning. Our study provides an empirical model to map critical social infrastructure within a community and identify levers for action to promote community resilience. It represents an assets-based lens for identifying resources and opportunities to reduce vulnerabilities for high risk populations, but can also be applied to the broader community to promote well-being. Future studies could explore the directional relationships depicted in the model and effectiveness, feasibility and appropriateness of different intervention strategies targeting each of the inputs in the framework of critical social infrastructure presented in this paper. In particular it will be important to determine how to fully engage representatives of high risk populations and non-traditional organizations not typically involved in disaster planning activities.",

By unraveling the complexities of the inputs and outputs influencing adaptive community response, it simplifies the identification of target points for intervention to enhance resilience. \u2018One size fits all\u2019 solutions are not adequate to promote community resilience.
