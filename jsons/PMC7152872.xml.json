Later, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 was identified based on sequencing of respiratory tract samples from these patients. As of April 12, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed patients and more than 3000 deaths have been reported in China, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. Analysis of the genome of SARS-CoV-2 showed that this new virus shares about 80\u201390% sequence identity to the original SARS-CoV. Both bioinformatics modeling and in vitro experiments indicate that 2019-nCoV likely utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to gain entry into human cells [2,3].",

            "text": "ACE2, discovered in 2000, shares 40% identity and 61% similarity with ACE [4]. The full-length protein structure of ACE2 consists of an N-terminal and a C-terminal domain with a single transmembrane helix and an intracellular segment [5]. Considering the difference in active sites between ACE2 and ACE, the functions of these two enzymes are distinct. Unlike ACE, which converts angiotensin I (Ang I) to angiotensin II (AngII), ACE2 converts Ang II to Ang-(1-(1 and Ang I to Ang-(1\u20139) [6,7]. ACE2 is expressed in different tissues, such as renal, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal [8,9]. ACE2 is also present in lung alveolar epithelial cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells [10]. ACE2 was previously identified as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 [11,12]. Considering that the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the SARS-CoV and that SARS-CoV-2 appears to use the same ACE2 receptor to enter cells, analyses of ACE2 expression and distribution in lung and related biological processes may help us understand the pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.",

Moreover, ACE2 is also related to adaptive immune responses [17]. In this current study, GSEA analysis showed that the high expression of ACE2 was related to innate immune responses, adaptive immune responses, B cell regulation and cytokine secretion, as well as an enhanced inflammatory response induced by IL-1, IL-10, IL-6, IL-8. We speculate that the immune system dysfunction involved in the high expression of ACE2 is related to the symptoms of a cytokine storm. A clinical study in Wuhan pointed out that the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-10 and IL-8 were significantly increased in critically ill patients with new coronavirus infection, indicating that the pathologic process may involve an exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine response [1]. This may be related to pyroptosis, which has been suggested as another pathogenic mechanism involved in COVID-19 infection. Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of apoptosis. The fact that tissue injury and death may be related to a pro-inflammatory process resulting from the viral infection suggests that the use of IL-1\u03b2 blockers or IL-18 blockers may have some benefit in COVID-19 patients.",

It has been shown that RPS3 plays an important role in cell mitosis by interacting with \u03b1-tubulin. When cells are infected with HIV-1, HIV-1 Tat protein can interact with RPS3 and disturb its localization on the spindle, and ultimately inhibit cell proliferation [18].

Ang2 induced vascular permeability and lung injury is facilitated by binding to the Angiotensin-2 receptor type 1 (AT1R) [26]. In a mouse model, SARS-CoV induced lung injury can be attenuated by blocking AT1R [27]. If SARS-CoV (and SARS-CoV-2) binding to ACE2 leads to a downregulation of ACE2, this could result in higher Ang2 levels and increased lung injury.

Additionally, DPP-4 was found to be an entry receptor for MERS, but this has not yet been shown in SARS-CoV-2. A further consideration and potential target for treatment may relate to the role of ADAM-17. While ACE2 is a membrane bound protein, it is cleaved by ADAM-17 leading to shedding to form soluble ACE2. ADAM-17 therefore may lead to a decrease in membrane bound ACE2, reducing its regulatory activity. AT1R upregulates ADAM-17, so use of an ARB may potentially block shedding and reduction of membrane bound ACE2. However, it is believed that the majority of ACE2 is membrane bound and that the decrease resulting from shedding would not significantly affect ACE2 activity to begin with [33].",

SARS-COV-2 virus uses the ACE2 receptor to gain entry into the cell, leading to the increase in proinflammatory cytokines and the development of cytokine storm, as well as increased viral replication (see Fig. 4). TMPRSS2 assists in S protein priming. ARBs may potentially increase the expression of ACE2, leading increased binding of SARS-CoV-2 and greater proinflammatory cytokine production. SARS-CoV-2 may at the same time downregulate ACE2, which leads to an increase in angiotensin 2 mediated lung injury. The negative regulatory activity of ACE2 is reduced by SARS-CoV-2 and leads to worsening severity of illness.",
