On March 11, 2020 , the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared COVID-19 a pandemic because of alarming levels of its spread, severity and inaction [2] . COVID-19 is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is sufficiently genetically divergent from the closely related Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), to be considered a new humaninfecting betacoronavirus [3] . It mainly affects the respiratory tract and the illness ranges in severity from asymptomatic or mild to severe or critical disease. Although the current estimate of the case fatality rate of COVID-19 is <5%, up to 15-18% of patients may become severe or critically ill, some of them requiring ICU care and mechanical ventilation [4] .",

First, to the best of our knowledge this is the first large meta-analysis on specific influence of diabetes on severity of COVID-19, as well as on its mortality. In addition, we also studied the prevalence of diabetes among COVID-19 patients. Second, we have included a large number of studies, with patient population above sixteen thousand, spanning three continents. Third, we have included only large studies, with more that 100 patients, thus each study contributed a robust data on diabetes-COVID19 association without increasing heterogeneity. Fourth, we have avoided including any duplicate studies by limiting our search to single database, limiting search to English articles only, and carefully going through each included article's study setting and author list. Fifth, while synthesizing results we have taken care of both heterogeneity as well as publication bias by appropriate statistical tools.",

Our results on prevalence are similar to a large Chinese nationwide study of 1590 patients which had shown the prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 patients to be 8.2% [23] . Another small meta-analysis of 12 Chinese studies (2,108 patients) by Fadini et al [24] also reported the prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 patients as 10.3%. Our study as well as these other previous studies indicate that the prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19 is in the range of 10%, which is similar to the population prevalence of diabetes in the general population of China and the USA (10.9% and 11.1%, respectively) [25, 26] . Thus our meta-analysis supports the previously held notion that the susceptibility of diabetic population to COVID-19 infection might not be increased but be similar to the non-diabetic population [27] .",

We found that diabetic patients with COVID-19 are twice more likely to develop severe COVID-19 disease and twice more likely to die due to it (odds ratio close to 2 for severity as well as mortality). Thus patients with COVID-19 and diabetes are more likely to develop ARDS, need ICU care, need invasive ventilation, and are more vulnerable to succumb to it. Our results are similar to two small meta-analyses, by Fadini et al (6 studies, 1687 patients) and Wang et al (6 studies, 1558 patients), which gave odds ratio of 2.26 and 2.47, respectively, for diabetic patients developing more adverse disease due to SARS-CoV-2 infection [24, 28] . Another systematic review of 7 studies by Singh et al also suggested that diabetes is a determinant of severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients [29] . However, our meta-analysis is the largest with 33 studies, and we have now conclusively shown the association of diabetes with COVID-19 mortality as well as severity.",

Further they found, serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, D-dimer, IL-6, serum ferritin and coagulation index, were significantly higher in diabetic patients compared to those without, suggesting that patients with diabetes are more susceptible to an inflammatory storm that leads to worsening of COVID-19 [30] .",

            "text": "The pathogenesis of increased mortality and severity of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes is still unclear. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 202-2004 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks in 2012 and 2015, had also resulted in increased severity and fatality in patients with diabetes mellitus [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . All these previous outbreaks were also caused by other coronaviruses, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively. To elucidate the mechanism of enhanced disease severity in diabetics following MERS-CoV infection, Kulcsar et al [36] used an animal model in which mice were made susceptible to MERS-CoV infection by expressing human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and type 2 diabetes was induced by administering a high-fat diet. Upon infection with MERS-CoV, diabetic mice had a prolonged phase of severe disease and delayed recovery that was independent of viral titres. Histological examination revealed that diabetic mice had delayed but prolonged systemic inflammation, fewer inflammatory monocyte/macrophages and CD4+ T cells, lower levels of chemokine ligand 2 and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 expression, lower levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), interleukin (IL) 6, IL 12b, and arginase 1 expression and higher levels of IL 17a expression. The data suggested that the increased disease severity observed in diabetes was likely due to a dysregulated immune response, which resulted in more severe and prolonged lung pathology [36] . Since patients with diabetes have multiple immune dysregulations such as phagocytic cell dysfunction, inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis, impaired T-cell mediated immune response, altered cytokine production, and ineffective microbial clearance [37] , these dysregulated immune responses may result into a cytokine profile resembling secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterised by increased IL 2, IL 7, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon-\u03b3 inducible protein 10, monocyte chemo-attractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03b1, and TNF\u03b1 [38, 39] .",

Two recent meta-analyses had shown that DPP4 inhibitors increased the risk of various infections [42, 43] while a third meta-analysis showed that there is no increased risk of infections with DPP4 inhibitors [44] .

According to the 2019 estimate, the age standardised diabetes prevalence in South-East Asia, including India, among ages 20-79 years, was estimated to be 11.3% (95% CI: 8.0%-15.9%), with the actual number of people with diabetes in India being more than 77 million [25, 47] . Drivers of type 2 diabetes in south Asia include genetic and epigenetic factors, intrauterine and early life factors, high carbohydrate dietary patterns, and increase in physical inactivity [48] . All these factors, not only increase the prevalence of diabetes, but are also major factors in the causation of obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, fatty liver, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, with a resultant increase in morbidity and mortality. In fact, diabetes, along with cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease accounted for 4%, 27%, and 3% of deaths, respectively, in South Asia [49] . During the current COVID-19 pandemic, our meta-analysis, as well as multiple other studies have shown that COVID-19 is particularly more severe in patients with these comorbidities with increased hospitalization, ICU and ventilatory requirements [50, 51] . With the huge population burden of diabetes in India, if urgent and strong measures are not taken to flatten the curve of COVID-19 pandemic in India, it will lead to disastrous consequences with overburdening of already stretched healthcare system of India. Especially, elderly population of India with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiac diseases will need special protection as enumerated in the preceding paragraph. Their blood sugars need to be better controlled and their health condition need to be better monitored, even in the face of lockdown, through measures such as tele-consultation and tele-medicine [52] .",

We have shown that diabetes is associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality; however, it cannot be said whether diabetes is acting as an independent factor responsible for this severity and mortality, or it is just a confounding factor. Many conditions such as elderly age, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and obesity, often co-exist with diabetes, and each of these comorbidities have been shown to be associated with severe COVID-19 and its mortality. In spite of this limitation, the implication our meta-analysis will remain unchanged that diabetic need to be protected from COVID-19, and they will need extra care if infected. The second limitation of this metaanalysis is that we have not been able to document the role of glycemic control on the severity or mortality of COVID-19. It has been shown previously that poor glycemic control, in terms of high HbA1c, was significantly associated with increased risk of various infections [53, 54] . However, none of the included studies on COVID-19 in our meta-analysis had evaluated glycemic control as one of the factors associated with severity and/or mortality; and this needs to be explored in further trials.",

This necessitates enhanced prevention of COVID-19 in diabetics, increased vigilance in patients of diabetes for COVID-19, and a lower threshold for monitoring, hospitalization, and ICU care if diabetics develop this infection. Results of our meta-analysis emphasizes the need for further investigation on the pathogenic mechanism of relationship between diabetes and COVID-19, and to explore its therapeutic implications.",
