As cases throughout the USA are steadily rising, we are only now getting a picture of its true extent. The numbers are staggering, and healthcare systems are struggling under the burden of this rapidly spreading disease. In this situation, it would be easy to forget how the pandemic is affecting the physical and emotional lives of residents and fellows, who are at the front lines of this battle. However, thanks to traditional and social media, the situation of the HCW has now come into the spotlight and many have even begun to consider the impact this pandemic will have on the training of residents and fellows.",

With rooms in the ED now fully occupied with COVID-19 patients waiting for hospital beds, stretchers are lined up wherever there is space and many hospitals have tents outside their EDs to house additional patients. Some are being transferred to the nearby Javits Convention Center, which has been converted into a field hospital, and others to the USNS Comfort docked on the Hudson River.",

All ICUs (cardiac or surgical) are now COVID ICUs, and temporary ICUs have been created on medicine floors, in peri-operative spaces and even endoscopy suites and all HCWs, regardless of their prior roles, are now taking care of hospitalized COVID patients In this situation, it has been especially challenging for specialists providing advanced services. For instance, last month, during the initial surge of patients, due to lack of resuscitation rooms, we received a patient presenting with a STEMI in a makeshift curtained-off room in the ED, before rushing her to our catheterization laboratory. STEMI patients often present in extremis, which is why they are brought to the resuscitation rooms first. But that night, this was not an option, it was touch-and-go, but we were lucky that all went well. Despite the surprising fall in the number of STEMIs presenting to our hospital during the pandemic, every new case presents a similar logistical challenge. It is not just because of a lack of space to triage patients, but also due to the fact that time-sensitive therapies of STEMI management need to be counterbalanced against the time and care that are required to deploy PPE, don gear and ensure isolation precautions to protect the staff -(any new patient could have COVID-19).",

Yet fellowship training in cardiovascular diseases relies heavily on experience in interpreting echocardiograms, nuclear tests, and other imaging studies as well as performing cardiac catheterizations and electrophysiology procedures. Since the vast majority of these are elective, they have been canceled. Additionally, outpatient clinics, a key component of a fellow's clinical training, have also been suspended, and replaced by the rare tele-health visit. This may have less of an effect on fellows engaged in three years of training, who might be able to make up for lost time in the subsequent years, however, this is especially problematic for our procedure based specialty fellows, such as interventional and electrophysiology fellows whose training is only 1-2 years. Interventional fellows are required to perform 400 procedures (ACGME) and 250 procedures (ABIM) before graduation (2, 3) .",

Assuming up to 2 months of lost time in the labs during this pandemic, it is estimated that the total number of cases performed will be reduced by 20%. Trainees at programs that provide only the minimal requisite number of cases, may not meet the required numbers this year. Additionally, a procedural based trainee, generally gains the most experience in fellowship at the end of their year of training when they operate with more independence. Yet, during the last months of this year, fellows, like most, are instead working as medical residents in COVID wards. Additionally, national, international conferences and local conferences including grand rounds and morning reports have been cancelled. Programs are making efforts to move these conferences to a virtual platform. However, due to competing clinical demands, there has been limited time for trainees to attend these conferences.",

Even those who are well worry about transmitting the virus to their loved ones and have considered living away from them; given the indefinite duration of this pandemic, for many it is unreasonable to consider living apart. Some trainees have indeed chosen to live apart from their families at great personal expense, others have tried to be especially diligent about distancing themselves while at home, and still others have accepted the possibility of transmitting the infection and hoping that they develop immunity. Some of the more stressful situations are those of pregnant house staff, who have concerns that this virus may not only cause harm to themselves but also to their unborn child. Many of our house staff have gotten ill, but have ultimately recovered. Sadly, the pandemic has taken the lives of members of the system's wider health care community including a nurse and a technician very dear to our trainees. These great losses have taken an emotional toll on all. Residents and fellows rely on their friends and families for emotional support. But given the social distancing in place, these support networks have become strained. Some are experiencing depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, just as were seen in many HCWs early in the pandemic in China (6).",

Apart from the suffering brought on by COVID itself, patients have to endure many other ordeals. They are isolated and alone and only see their providers through layers of face shields, masks and other protective gear. Further, to limit exposure to HCWs, direct patient interactions are reserved for essential issues. The tragedy of this pandemic is that the necessity of every treatment and therapy for the patient has to be measured against the safety of HCWs. At no time is this more evident than when a patient is in extremis or goes into cardiac arrest. The need to gain rapid access to the patient and institute life-saving and resuscitative measures is sharply at odds with the time and care needed to doff protective gear and ensure isolation precautions.",
