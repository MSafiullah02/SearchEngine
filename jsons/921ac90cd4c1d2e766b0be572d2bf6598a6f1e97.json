Climate change can further alter or disrupt natural systems, making it possible for diseases to spread or emerge in areas where they had been limited or had not existed, or for diseases to disappear by making areas less hospitable to the vector or the pathogen. The cause-and-effect chain from climate change to changing patterns of health determinants and outcomes is often extremely complex and includes factors such as wealth, distribution of income, status of the public health infrastructure, provision of medical care, and access to adequate nutrition, safe water, and sanitation. Therefore, the severity of future impacts will be determined by changes in climate as well as by concurrent changes in nonclimatic factors and by the adaptation measures implemented to reduce negative impacts.",

However, models facilitate understanding of what is known and what still needs to be understood of how systems actually function. In the context of climate change, models are critical for planning appropriate adaptation options to reduce the likelihood that climaterelated changes will increase the burden of health determinants and outcomes.

Although public health has considerable experience dealing with exposures to hazardous agents where a defined exposure causes a specific adverse health outcome in identifiable exposed populations, weather has only recently been considered a potentially hazardous exposure that needs to be evaluated in its own right (Bernard and Ebi 2001) . Isolating the role of weather in disease patterns is difficult because most climatesensitive health determinants and outcomes have many causal factors, with the causal chains neither linear nor direct, sometimes with a lag between the exposure and response, and with a number of factors influencing whether an adverse health outcome occurs. Although the entire population is exposed to weather, climate variability, and climate change, the risk associated with a particular exposure varies within the population due to intrinsic and extrinsic vulnerabilities. For example, poverty, under-nutrition, water storage practices, substandard housing, lack of access to safe water and sanitation, certain land use practices, and other factors can combine with climatic conditions to favor vector-breeding and promote the spread of some infectious diseases. Further, exposures are changing over time with changing weather patterns.",

There is extensive literature discussing approaches to low-dose extrapolation to predict possible health impacts of exposures to occupational and environmental hazards. Whereas low dose extrapolation is bounded at no exposure and no response, increasing climate variability suggests the need for high-dose extrapolation. Different statistical approaches may be needed to estimate the shape of exposure-response relationships outside the upper range of current exposure data.

Assuming the model will be used to project possible future health impacts, the exposure-response relationship needs to be quantified in ways that allow linkage with, at a minimum, climate and socioeconomic models. The critical factors associated with the outcome need to be understood sufficiently for incorporation into the model; this includes considering the extent to which other factors (or alternative explanations) could explain an association between weather/climate and a health outcome, and whether the factors to be included in the model are consistent with what is known about the health outcome. In many cases, model development will be constrained by our incomplete understanding of disease mechanisms. For many climate-sensitive health outcomes, there is limited knowledge of the relationships among weather, other drivers of the health outcome, and the health outcome. For example, Chan et al. (1999) developed an integrated assessment framework for climate change and infectious diseases, and conducted a literature review to determine data availability. Of the 16 linkages in this simple model, data were available for only three, primarily because the other linkages were multi-disciplinary questions that had received insufficient research attention.",

One limitation of current malaria models is that they rarely include key drivers besides climatic factors, such as land use change, drug resistance, and economic and technological development, and no model includes all these factors. Appropriate consideration of these factors and how they interact is important when trying to project plausible possible future changes in the geographic range and incidence of malaria. Projecting likely locations where malaria may retract or spread with changing weather conditions within the next few decades (in order to decide where surveillance programs may best be placed, for example) may require a different model than projecting likely burdens of endemic and epidemic malaria under specific climatic changes.",

Because climate change will be experienced at local scales, local actions, such as land use changes that contribute to heating or cooling of the environment (e.g. urban heat islands), can amplify or ameliorate larger scale climate forces. In addition, although by definition measurements of the impact of climate change entails identifying effects relative to \"exposures\" above a baseline, the baseline itself has been changing.

In the year 2000, climate change was estimated to have caused the loss of over 150,000 lives (0.3% of worldwide deaths) and 5,500,000 Disability Adjusted Life Years Lost (DALYs) (0.4%), with malnutrition accounting for approximately 50% of deaths and DALYs (Ezzati et al. 2002; McMichael et al. 2004 ).

Absolute health burdens depend on assumptions of population growth, future baseline disease incidence, and the extent of adaptation. Warmer winter temperatures are projected to result in a small proportional decrease in cardiovascular and respiratory disease mortality attributable to climate extremes in tropical regions, with a slightly larger benefit in temperate regions. The relative risk for diarrhea in 2030 in low-income countries is projected to be between 1.0 and 1.1 under unmitigated emissions, compared with baseline climate. Countries with an annual GDP of $6,000 or more are assumed to have no additional risk of diarrhea. The projected impacts of malnutrition vary from a large increase (relative risk=1. . Developed countries are assumed to suffer no climate change-related malnutrition impacts. Coastal flooding is projected to result in a large proportional increase in risk under unmitigated emissions; however, this is applied to a very low burden of adverse health outcomes. The projected increase in relative risk of coastal flooding is equally high in high-and low-income countries. Large changes are projected in the risk of falciparum malaria in countries at the edge of the current distribution, with relative changes much smaller in areas that are currently highly endemic for malaria.",

Thresholds can be viewed as the exposure concentration at which the health burden associated with exposure becomes unacceptable. Knowledge of the factors that determine the health burden in a population, and how those factors interact, facilitates the identification of thresholds, and, thus, the assessment of risk. The choice of a threshold is often based on social acceptance of a particular risk (Jones et al. 2004) . Identification of thresholds is relatively easy for non-continuous events such as floods and tropical storms. In high-income countries, the population expects that these events will result in no or at most a handful of deaths. Setting thresholds for continuous distributions is more difficult; it requires deciding how much disease is acceptable. A threshold above zero means that it is acceptable that a specified percentage of a population will contract a particular disease and perhaps die. Different populations may accept different thresholds of risk, as in the case of some occupational and environmental exposure limits.",

Climate is a primary determinant of whether the conditions in a particular location are suitable for stable Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission (Craig et al. 1999; MARA/ARMA 1998) . Changes in precipitation or temperature may result in conditions during the season of transmission that are conducive to increased or decreased parasite and vector populations, or may lengthen or shorten the period of time that mosquitoes or parasites can survive. Small changes in precipitation or temperature may cause previously inhospitable altitudes or ecosystems to become conducive to transmission by rendering hospitable higher altitudes that were formerly too cold or desert fringes that previously were too dry for mosquito populations to develop. Based on experience, the degree of change in weather variables that has been associated with increased disease transmission can be used to establish an exposure threshold. This threshold can be used to model future malaria risk, assuming limited change in land use, vector control, parasite drug resistance, access to medical care, and other factors.",

There usually is a narrow range of temperatures at which mortality is lowest, with increasing rates on either side of the minimum. It is not clear from these distributions what should be the point that separates acceptable from unacceptable mortality. Historically, meteorological organizations or national weather services set a temperature above which they declared a heat event (Kalkstein et al. 1996) . Because humidity and others factors also determine which weather patterns are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in a community, some heat event early warning systems are based on the association between daily mortality and synoptic air masses; a threshold is set based on the number of daily deaths that can be discernable above the background rate (Kalkstein et al. 1996) .",

An age of emerging infectious diseases could result from the re-emergence of infectious diseases that are currently controlled through public health efforts along with the simultaneous emergence of new infectious diseases. The likely consequences could include increasing rates of infectious diseases in both high-and low-income countries, with falling life expectancies and economic productivity. Travel and trade, microbiological resistance, human behavior, breakdowns in health systems, and increased pressure on the environment would facilitate this health transition (Barrett et al. 1998) . A number of worldwide events and trends support this possibility, such as malaria parasites becoming increasing drug resistant, HIV/AIDS lowering life expectancy in several African countries, the mosquitoborne disease West Nile virus crossing the Atlantic, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) quickly moving worldwide via travelers, etc.",

About half of the 0.4 billion difference resulted from an increase in the number of projected deaths, the majority from the higher projected levels of HIV/AIDS and the remainder from a reduction in the number of projected births, mostly due to lower expected future fertility levels.

There will be higher confidence about the potential impacts of flooding in regions where climate models suggest that extreme precipitation events are projected to increase, yet other regions may experience rare flooding events with severe consequences.

For example, signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change regularly submit national communications that summarize their vulnerability to climate change and the options available to reduce projected future impacts. Non-Annex 1 countries (primarily low-income countries) are beginning their Second National Communications and many would like to include health among the sectors they consider.

Ideally, model development should be an iterative process involving scientists and policymakers to ensure that modeling results will address the needs of decision-makers and contribute to the body of scientific knowledge. One example of how scientists and decision-makers have worked together is the development of heat event early warning systems that use information on physiological responses to high ambient temperature and on populations at increased risk during a heat event to create systems designed to reduce morbidity and mortality (Kalkstein et al. 1996) .",
