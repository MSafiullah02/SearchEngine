            "text": "Parkinson's disease (PD) was first described as \u2018paralysis agitans\u2019 by James Parkinson in 1817 (Parkinson, 1817). Classically, PD refers to progressive parkinsonism due to loss of pigmented aminergic brainstem neurons without an identifiable cause, while \u2018parkinsonism\u2019 refers simply to the syndrome of bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity and postural reflex impairment. Over nearly two centuries, Parkinson's clinical description has provided the framework for clinical investigations, including epidemiologic ones. More recently, investigations of a few families with genetic parkinsonism have revealed a wide range of clinical and pathological features in persons sharing a single disease\u2010causing mutation, calling into question the assumptions underlying the strict syndromic classification employed by most studies to date. Whether a similar heterogeneity applies to the common \u2018idiopathic\u2019 disorder is not known. Although our current clinicopathological definition of PD may merit revision, further work is needed to determine what an appropriate new definition should be, and the classical definitions will be used in this discussion.",

Since then, epidemiologic approaches have been used not only to investigate the population distribution of PD, but also as a way to glean clues as to the cause of this \u2018idiopathic\u2019 disorder. Heredity, infection, toxicant exposure and multifactorial gene\u2013environment interactions have been proposed. Although single genetic or environmental causes have been identified, these explain only a small proportion of all cases (Marras 2002, Korell 2005). This chapter will provide an overview of this work, beginning with descriptive studies, followed by studies investigating the determinants of PD. Because other chapters in this volume thoroughly address the genetics of PD, this topic will be considered briefly here.",

In some instances, PD cases can be identified through health service rosters within defined geographic areas or in enumerated populations. In others, cases of PD are sought independently of the health care system, such as through door\u2010to\u2010door surveys.

Clinical diagnostic accuracy can vary with the experience of the practitioner. Essential tremor, for example, may be confused with PD in up to 40% of diagnoses in some settings (Mutch et al., 1986). Conversely, actual cases of PD may be missed, particularly in older age groups, where slowness and tremor may be discounted as \u2018normal\u2019 or misdiagnosed as one of several other common disorders affecting this age group (for example, arthritis, stroke, dementia). A further difficulty is presented by persons with both parkinsonism and dementia, who may be classified as either primary disorder in different epidemiologic surveys. The common use of neuroleptics in institutionalized elderly, especially those with cognitive impairment, can further confound diagnosis in this age group.",

First, because survival with PD typically involves many years or even decades, very long follow\u2010up is necessary. In addition, clinical diagnostic criteria do not perfectly predict \u2018classic\u2019 postmortem features of PD. Error rates of more than 20% were seen in one clinicopathological series by Hughes et al. (1993). The same authors later suggested that the use of standard clinical criteria (e.g. the UK PD brain bank criteria) improved accuracy of a clinical diagnosis in 100 patients (Hughes et al., 2001) in which 90 were shown to have idiopathic PD at postmortem and 10 had other parkinsonian syndromes. In a report published the following year (n = 143), Hughes et al. (2002) estimated that the positive predictive value of the clinical diagnosis for the whole group was 85.3%, with 122 cases correctly clinically diagnosed, 98.6% (72 out of 73) for idiopathic PD, and 71.4% (50 out of 70) for other parkinsonian syndromes. However, since autopsy is most likely performed when the clinical diagnosis is not certain, misclassification may be overestimated in published series (Maraganore et al., 1999). Nonetheless, in the few settings where postmortem validation of PD is possible, valuable insights can result (Ross et al., 2004).",

Patients with PD show reduced tracer accumulation in the striatum contralateral to the affected limbs using markers of the presynaptic dopaminergic system in the very early stages of the disease (Marek 1996, Wenning 1998, Benamer 2003). Others have suggested that ultrasound may be a useful way of identifying nigral injury in PD (Berg et al., 2002). Although these approaches are promising, their abilities to distinguish normal from abnormal and to distinguish PD from other forms of parkinsonism have not yet been developed to the extent that any of these techniques can be used outside the research setting. In epidemiologic research, broad application of these techniques remains difficult, as they are not widely available. However, combining these tools with other, more easily characterized, potential biomarkers, such as olfactory testing, may be useful in prospective studies to identify those \u2018at risk\u2019 for developing parkinsonism, to identify those persons appropriate for interventions to protect against PD and to provide better methods for case definition in studies of genetic and environmental risk factors, where incorrect classification of cases and controls could significantly alter results (Siderowf 2005, Stiasny\u2010Kolster 2005).",

Onset of the motor features of PD is insidious. It is commonly held that at least 50% of substantia nigra pars compacta cells are damaged before the symptoms of PD prompt medical attention (Bernheimer et al., 1973). It has long been observed in autopsy series that the pathologic changes of PD can be identified in the brains of persons who were not diagnosed during life; these \u2018incidental Lewy body\u2019 cases increase with increasing age of the population surveyed, and may represent clinically unrecognized PD (Gibb and Lees, 1991). More recently, improved neuropathological methods led to the proposal that neuropathologic injury in PD begins in lower brainstem and olfactory nuclei, and progresses through predictable stages over time, involving the substantia nigra and producing classical parkinsonism only relatively late, at stage 4 (Braak 2003a, Braak 2004). Lewy neurite pathology can also be seen in autonomic ganglia outside the central nervous system, leading to the further hypothesis that PD may begin outside the central nervous system, well before the classic signs of parkinsonism develop (Braak et al., 2003b). If this is correct, the true onset of the disease process may begin long before the neurological syndrome is diagnosed. This research hypothesis merits further investigation. To be effective, studies of risk or protective factors, as well as investigations of preventive therapies, may need to target time periods decades before the onset of disease.",

This is particularly important for a slowly progressive disorder such as PD. However, as discussed above, because the time of onset of PD is not easily determined, incidence can vary depending on the definition of disease, as well as by factors such as method of ascertainment and access to health care. Studies using more intensive ascertainment methods, such as in\u2010person screening, may find higher rates (de Lau et al., 2004). Crude estimates of incidence can also vary due to the age and gender distribution of the population studied, and crude rates must be compared with this in mind. For example, reported incidence of PD varies fourfold, from 4.5 to 19 per 100 000 population per year when the entire age spectrum of the population is considered (Rosati 1980, Harada 1983, Ashok 1986, Granieri 1991, Mayeux 1995, Sutcliffe 1995, Fall 1996, Kusumi 1996, Bower 1999, Kuopio 1999, MacDonald 2000, Twelves 2003, Van Den Eeden 2003). However, when studies using similar methods are compared, and rates are adjusted to a reference population, this range is markedly reduced (11.0\u201313.9/100 000 population per year; Van Den Eeden et al., 2003).",

PD incidence increases steadily in the sixth through the eighth decades in most populations, but a decrease in late life is seen in some studies. Whether this apparent decline in PD incidence is the result of methodologic challenges, such as the greater difficulty identifying and diagnosing PD in the very old (Bower et al., 2000), rather than an actual decline in disease frequency, is not certain. If the decline is real, a biological \u2018window of vulnerability\u2019 for PD may exist. Investigation of the determinants of this could provide important insights into the causes of PD.",

A steady increase over the past several decades could implicate exposures increasingly present, such as those due to industrialization or lifestyle practices. Conversely, if PD incidence has remained stable over time, recent environmental factors are unlikely to be important causes of PD. Only two reports have addressed this possibility, with differing results. Reviews of the Mayo Clinic database from Olmsted County, Minnesota, found no change in age\u2010specific PD incidence between 1935 and 1990 (Rajput 1984, Rocca 2001). One limitation to this work is the small population size. Only 154 PD cases were incident in 15 years, resulting in poor precision of these estimates. In contrast, in southwestern Finland, based on a larger number of cases, estimated incidence of PD was increased in men, particularly those aged 60 and older, in 1992 as compared to 1971 (Kuopio et al., 1999). Although it is possible that these differences may reflect temporal changes in environmental exposures in Finland, but not in Minnesota, this cannot be determined from the published studies.",

By the eighth decade, estimated prevalence in European and North American populations is between 1000 and 3000 cases per 100 000 population. Although differences in the age distributions in these populations, diagnostic criteria, ascertainment methods, access to health care or disease survival rates may explain much of this variation, international variation in PD frequency is seen even after adjusting for many of these inconsistencies (Zhang and Roman, 1993). Risk factors, which may vary geographically, include both genetic differences in disease susceptibility and exposure to causative and protective environmental factors. Although PD is intimately related to aging, it has been well documented that its underlying process is distinct from natural aging (McGeer 1988, Fearnley 1991, Gibb 1991). An age\u2010determined process, such as an acquired defect in cellular metabolism, or a process requiring a long period of time to manifest \u2013 as might result from prolonged toxicant exposure or the cumulative effects of many individual injuries to nerve cells \u2013 might cause a similar pattern.

Alternatively, culturally determined differences in male and female behavior, with associated differences in exposure to risk factors, could explain the pattern. The latter hypothesis is supported by a large Finnish study showing a dramatic increase in the male\u2010to\u2010female relative risk from 0.9 in 1971 to 1.9 in 1992 (Kuopio et al., 1999). Others have suggested that hormonal differences between men and women explain these differences, although the relationship does not appear to be a simple one (see also section 6.3.7). Further epidemiologic studies, along with experimental laboratory studies, will be necessary to determine whether men are at greater risk for PD.",

Nevertheless, two multiracial population\u2010based studies estimating the incidence of PD in upper West\u2010Side Manhattan (Mayeux et al., 1995) and in Northern California (Van Den Eeden et al., 2003) suggest racial differences in PD incidence. In the Manhattan study, African\u2010American women had lower rates, but African\u2010American men had higher rates than whites (Mayeux et al., 1995). The Northern California study, a much larger evaluation of PD incidence, showed a lower frequency of PD in both men and women of African or Asian descent than in non\u2010 Hispanic whites (Van Den Eeden et al., 2003). Results remain equivocal in both studies, however, as even in this large study the numbers of non\u2010whites were low and between\u2010group confidence intervals for race\u2010specific PD incidence overlapped.",

Others have suggested that dermal melanin may protect against PD by trapping potential neurotoxins before they reach the brain (Mars and Larsson, 1999). Because dermal melanin is regularly sloughed with keratinized skin, persons with more dermal melanin may be protected from the passage of toxicant compounds into the central nervous system. Alternatively, differences in non\u2010genetic risk factors may explain differences among populations. For example, PD prevalence is high in the Inuit population of Greenland (Wermuth et al., 2004). This population is at risk for dietary and other exposures to persistent organic pollutants (Dewailly et al., 1999), agents suggested to be risk factors for PD.",

After a 13\u2010year follow\u2010up, results from the DATATOP cohort study show that the mortality rate was similar to that of the general population and that PD did not affect survival differently across gender or age groups in a selected group of otherwise healthy clinical trial participants (Marras et al., 2005a). In other clinical trial populations, mortality has been higher than expected, however (Hely 1999, Lees 2001, Fall 2003). Among participants in the DATATOP study, severity, rate of worsening of parkinsonism and response to levodopa are related to survival (Marras et al., 2005b), suggesting that differences in these factors among studies may also account for the observed differences in PD\u2010related mortality among these studies.",

Demographic differences in the frequency of PD, particularly differences in PD incidence, may be the result of ascertainment bias. Alternatively, differences in risk factors for PD among different demographic groups may explain these patterns. Some of these possibilities have been discussed above. Disease clusters, representing more than the expected number of new cases of PD at a certain time and/or in a certain place, are another type of pattern that may suggest a shared cause of disease and provide clues to the underlying etiology of all cases. An example is the cluster of parkinsonism in narcotics addicts caused by 1\u2010methyl\u20104\u2010phenyl\u20101,2,3,6\u2010tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) exposure (Langston et al., 1983) (Fig. 6.1\n). MPTP induces parkinsonism that is similar to PD, with key symptoms that improve with levodopa treatment and a similar side\u2010effect profile. Differences include the more rapid onset of symptoms in MPTP\u2010induced parkinsonism than in PD, and possibly some differences in neuropathologic features as well. Although MPTP injection is clearly not a cause of most PD, investigation of this cluster provided an important animal model. Investigation of the mechanism of MPTP toxicity led to the hypothesis that toxicants may cause PD, and has focused interest on compounds with structural or functional similarities (Fig. 6.2\n). Other proposed clusters, such as the syndrome of motor neuron disease\u2013parkinsonism\u2013dementia in certain areas of the Western Pacific (Spencer, 1987) or several clusters in Canada (Kumar et al., 2004) have yet to reveal specific etiologic factors.",

Because persons with disease may be more aware of disease in relatives, these studies in part may reflect reporting bias. Elbaz et al. (2003a) showed evidence for family information bias whereby cases with PD are more likely to report a relative with PD than are control subjects, increasing the risk estimate by 133%. Studies in twins do not support a genetic cause for typical age at PD onset, although genetic factors appear to be increased in those with younger age at onset (Duvoisin 1981, Marsden 1987, Marttila 1988, Vieregge 1992, Tanner 1994, Wirdefeldt 2004).",

In many of these cases, the clinical features resemble typical PD. However, within affected families there are often clinical features that are unusual for PD. At present, mutations in at least five genes have been firmly associated with parkinsonism: (1) \u03b1\u2010synuclein (SNCA or PARK1; Polymeropoulos et al., 1997); (2) parkin (PRKN or PARK2; Kitada et al., 1998); (3) DJ\u20101 (DJ1 or PARK7; Bonifati et al., 2003); (4) PTEN\u2010induced putative kinase I (PINK1 or PARK6; Polymeropoulos et al., 1997); and (5) leucine\u2010rich repeat kinase 2 or dardarin (LRRK2 or PARK8; Paisan\u2010Ruiz 2004, Zimprich 2004) (Table 6.4\n). PINK1 homozygous mutations have been reported to be an important cause of disease among Italian sporadic patients with early\u2010onset parkinsonism, whereas the role of single heterozygous mutations is less clear (Bonifati et al., 2005). The LRRK2 G2019S mutation is the most common pathogenic mutation linked to parkinsonism, accounting for 1\u20132% of cases, including cases of not only younger but also older age at disease onset (Kay et al., 2006). Other candidate PD loci have been proposed, including putative disease\u2010causing mutations in the ubiquitin carboxy\u2010terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) (Leroy et al., 1998) and in a nuclear receptor of subfamily 4 (NR4A2 or NURRI) (Le et al., 2003). These candidates do not map to known PD linkage regions, but polymorphisms in both genes have been associated with PD in some case\u2010control studies (as reviewed by Bertram and Tanzi, 2005). The GSK3B polymorphism has been reported to alter transcription and splicing and interact with tau haplotypes to modify PD risk (Kwok et al., 2005).",

By depleting stores of glutathione, iron may have a role in the progression of parkinsonism associated with exposure to other chemicals that are metabolized to free radicals and/or contribute to the adverse effects of oxidative stress (Kaur et al., 2003). Also, since iron has a strong catalytic power to generate highly reactive hydroxyl radicals from iron (II) and hydrogen peroxide, increased levels of iron in the brain can increase oxidative stress (Fenton reaction). Excessive iron accumulation in the brain is also a potential risk for neuronal damage, which may be promoted by other triggering factors (Lan and Jiang, 1997). A combined high dietary intake of iron and manganese may increase the risk of developing PD (Powers et al., 2003). Dietary intake of manganese alone does not seem to have toxic effects, except among individuals with liver failure (Hauser et al., 1994). Although dietary intake is the main source of non\u2010occupational exposure to manganese, occupational exposure seems to be a more influential PD risk factor. Case\u2010control studies suggest that occupational exposure to metals (Gorell 2004, Racette 2005) may be at increased risk of PD, although cohort studies have not replicated this (Fryzek 2005, Fored 2006).",

In laboratory studies, PCBs have been shown to reduce dopamine levels in the brain areas affected in PD (Seegal 1986, Chu 1996). The association between PCBs and PD has been studied in a blinded comparison of postmortem determinations of caudate PCB concentrations in PD patients and controls (Corrigan et al., 1998). PD brains had significantly higher levels of PCB congener 153, and several other congeners tended to be higher in PD caudate. Also increased in PD brains were the organochlorine pesticide dieldrin and the dichloro\u2010diphenyl\u2010trichloroethane (DDT) metabolite 1,1\u2010dichloro\u20102,2\u2010bis(4\u2010chlorophenyl)ethene (DDE).

            "text": "Given the increasing evidence that environmental factors play a role in PD, there has been an increasing effort to identify occupational risk factors, but to date few have been identified. A higher frequency of PD has been reported among teachers and health care workers (Tsui et al., 1999). These findings were replicated in a case\u2010control study in twin pairs discordant for PD (Tanner et al., 2003), and in very large occupational mortality studies in the USA (Schulte et al., 1996) and the UK (Coggon et al., 1995). It has been suggested that an infectious etiology could explain the increased risk in these occupational groups. Alternatively, these associations could be related to some other unrecognized occupation\u2010associated risk factor, to premorbid personality characteristics predisposing to certain occupations (Menza, 2000) or to issues of study design, such as ascertainment bias or confounding by age or other factors. A higher frequency of PD has also been reported in carpenters and cleaners (Fall et al., 1999) and in workers chronically exposed to metals (Gorell et al., 2004). Welding has been proposed as a risk factor (Racette et al., 2005), but this finding is controversial (Fryzek et al., 2005), with recent results from a nationwide linkage study indicating no support for an association between welding and PD, or any other specific basal ganglia and movement disorders (Fored et al., 2006). Overall, results from the available studies are inconclusive, reported findings need confirmation and not all occupations have been evaluated. Differences within even one type of occupation make occupation groups heterogeneous and comparisons difficult.",

(2005a) that show either that higher levels of physical activity may lower the risk of PD in men, or that men predisposed to PD tend to avoid strenuous activity in their early adult years. A significantly lower level of physical activity was present before diagnosis (men, 12 years prior; women, 2\u20134 years prior), and there was a sustained decrease in physical activity after diagnosis. Case\u2010control studies, however, have shown inconsistent results. In one Chinese hospital\u2010based study investigating risk factors for classic\u2010onset versus young\u2010onset PD, the duration of exercise was substantially longer in the young\u2010onset group than in controls or in the classic\u2010onset PD group (Tsai et al., 2002). In another small study assessing the lifetime physical activity via sports/leisure activity and participation using visual analog scales, there was no difference in lifetime physical activity between cases and controls; however, there was a greater decline in activity after age 50 years in those with PD (Fertl et al., 1993). In a nested case\u2010control study of male Harvard students, moderate physical activity was associated with a lower risk of PD, but this association was not seen at higher levels of physical activity (Sasco et al., 1992).",

Higher levels of uric acid, a potent antioxidant, during midlife were associated with a 40% reduced risk of PD in one prospective cohort (Davis et al., 1996). This observation was recently replicated in a nested case\u2010control study in the health professional prospective cohort study (Weisskopf et al., 2006, unpublished; see Ascherio et al., 2006 for abstract).

Since that time, however, clinical and neuropathological criteria have clearly differentiated postencephalitic parkinsonism from typical idiopathic PD. Although subsequent studies have been unable to identify an infectious agent in PD (Marttila 1977, Wang 1993), a number of studies have continued to suggest that infection may play a role in idiopathic PD. As described previously, increased PD frequency in health care workers and teachers has been linked to infection (Schulte et al., 1996). One study observed elevated coronavirus antibody levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of PD patients, supporting a possible link of PD with coronavirus infections (Fazzini et al., 1992), a common cause of respiratory infections. Another study noticed reduced risk for PD associated with most viral childhood infections, especially measles (Sasco and Paffenbarger, 1985); both studies await replication. The soil pathogen Nocardia asteroides causes a levodopa\u2010responsive movement disorder and nigral degeneration in mice (Kobbata and Beaman, 1991), but a serologic case\u2010control study did not support its role in human PD (Hubble et al., 1995).",

Head injury can trigger an inflammatory cascade, or conceivably disrupt the blood\u2013brain barrier, increasing risk of exposure to toxicants or infectious agents. In a sibpair study (Maher et al., 2002) and a study of twin pairs concordant for PD (Goldman et al., 2006), the sibling with younger\u2010onset PD was more likely to have sustained a head injury. In twins discordant for PD, a previous head injury with amnesia or loss of consciousness was associated with a nearly fourfold increased risk of PD. Significant head injury is rare, however, and there may be a latency up to 30 years between injury and PD diagnosis, minimizing the chance that disease\u2010related disability caused the injury (Factor 1991, Seidler 1996, Taylor 1999). Severity of head injury is likely to be important and there may be a dose effect; there is no association with PD and mild head injury without loss of consciousness. Nevertheless, medical record validation suggests that this is a real association, not explained by recall bias.",

The similarities in the pathogenetic background of PD and Alzheimer's disease and animal data suggesting that anti\u2010inflammatory drugs may protect against PD (Ferger et al., 1999) have encouraged investigation of the association between NSAID use and PD risk in humans. An inverse association of NSAID use with risk of PD has been observed in two prospective studies for non\u2010aspirin NSAIDs, as well as for aspirin (Abbott 2003, Chen 2003). Interestingly, in a cross\u2010sectional study of 1258 PD cases and 6638 controls from the General Practice Research Database, this inverse association was again observed for men, but not women, in whom non\u2010aspirin NSAID use was associated with a higher risk of PD (Hernan et al., 2006). Whether this reflects a characteristic of the study population or method, or a true gender difference in risk, will require studies in other populations.",

An inverse association between cigarette smoking and PD has been observed in studies spanning more than 30 years, involving diverse populations and including several large prospective investigations (Doll 1994, Grandinetti 1994, Benedetti 2000, Willems\u2010Giesbergen 2000). A meta\u2010analysis (Hernan et al., 2002a) indicated a 40% reduced risk of PD in smokers. Three basic categories of smoking were evaluated: ever smoking, past smoking and current smoking behavior. Long duration (highest pack/year) correlated with dose, and smoking more than 5 years prior to PD onset was not protective; recent smoking appeared more protective. Other research suggests cigarette smoking, on average, appears to lower the risk of developing PD by about half (Sugita et al., 2001). This inverse association has been reported in nearly every population studied over more than 30 years (Quik, 2004), and a recent study in a population characterized by a high prevalence of occupational pesticide exposure confirms an inverse correlation between cigarette smoking and PD in this potentially \u2018high\u2010risk\u2019 group as well (Galanaud et al., 2005). One report suggests the inverse association of smoking and PD is only present in those with a specific monoamine oxidase\u2010B allele (Checkoway et al., 1998), although this was not replicated (Hernan et al., 2002b), and other single observations suggest other interactions of genes and smoking (Tan et al., 2002).",

Indeed, the personalities of those who have gone on to develop PD have been described as shy, cautious, inflexible, punctual and depressive (Hubble et al., 1993b); such persons may be less likely to smoke or drink. In contrast, indirect evidence against this theory derives from a study in twin pairs discordant for PD (Tanner et al., 2002). The twins without PD had smoked more than their brothers. Despite a high correlation for smoking in monozygotic twin pairs, this difference was more marked in the monozygotic pairs, known to be remarkably similar in personality. Similar results have been reported in other studies of twins (Bharucha et al., 1986) and siblings (Scott et al., 2005) discordant for PD.",

Indirect evidence supporting a role for nicotine is provided by the observation that PD was less commonly reported among users of smokeless tobacco in a large prospective cohort (O'Reilly et al., 2005). Animal studies suggest that nicotine may protect against experimental parkinsonism (Janson 1993, Prasad 1994) (Table 6.5\n). Nicotine has been found to protect against transection\u2010induced and MPTP\u2010induced dopaminergic neuronal cell loss in rodent substantia nigra (Janson 1993, Prasad 1994). In addition, nicotine has antioxidant properties (Ferger et al., 1998), and increases striatal trophic factors (Maggio et al., 1997). Alternatively, smoking may afford indirect protection by inducing peripheral detoxifying enzymes, or by reducing bioactivation of protoxins. This latter hypothesis is supported by the observation that cigarette smoking reduces monoamine oxidase\u2010B activity in humans (Fowler et al., 1996).",

(1999) reported the mean age at onset in ever\u2010smoking men was significantly higher than in never\u2010smoking men, results of four other studies assessing age at onset of PD in relation to smoking status (Haack 1981, Rajput 1987, Morens 1996b, Levy 2002, De Reuck 2005) revealed the same or a younger age of PD onset in smokers. Interestingly, however, in several prospective cohort studies, survival of those persons with PD who continue to smoke cigarettes appears to be similar to, or even somewhat better than, survival of non\u2010smokers with PD (Grandinetti 1994, Elbaz 2003b, Chen 2006), in contrast to the typically increased mortality observed in cigarette smokers. This tantalizing preliminary information suggests that some aspect of smoking may not only modify disease risk, but also improve survival once PD is manifest.",

For example, a longitudinal study and two case\u2010control studies of incident PD cases provide provocative evidence that coffee drinking may be inversely associated with PD risk. A longitudinal study of Japanese\u2010American men indicated greater use of coffee was inversely associated with PD risk in a dose\u2010dependent fashion (Ross et al., 2000). A very provocative finding in the same cohort was that greater use of coffee was inversely associated with incidental Lewy bodies at postmortem (Ross et al., 1999). A similar dose\u2010dependent inverse association between coffee drinking and PD was observed in two prospective studies (Benedetti 2000, Willems\u2010Giesbergen 2000), and retrospectively an incident case\u2010control study in Northern California (Nelson et al., 1999). In each case, the inverse association between PD and coffee drinking continued to be observed in multivariate analyses adjusting for cigarette smoking, alcohol use and other potential confounders. Similar associations had previously been reported in a few case\u2010control studies of prevalent cases, but these results were inconsistent, and a dose\u2013response gradient was not described (Tanner 1996, Checkoway 1998).",

It has been suggested a potential interaction between hormone exposure, primarily estrogen, and caffeine consumption may mediate PD. In participants of the Cancer Prevention Study II, caffeine intake was associated with a significantly lower mortality of PD in men but not in women (Ascherio et al., 2004). In women, the association depended on estrogen use, with a relative risk for PD of 0.47 (95% CI 0.27\u20130.8) in caffeine consumers not using hormones and of 1.31 (95% CI 0.75\u20132.3) in hormone users. Caffeine may be neuroprotective through its antagonist action on the adenosine A2A\u2010receptor (Chen et al., 2002a), which in laboratory studies, modulates dopaminergic neurotransmission (Popoli 1991, Nehlig 1992) and protects against striatal dopamine loss caused by MPTP (Richardson 1997, Kanda 1998). A2A\u2010receptor antagonists are receiving increasing attention as potential treatments, in particular for on/off fluctuations and dyskinesia in combination with levodopa therapy (Xu et al., 2005), but also as a possible monotherapy in early\u2010stage PD because of positive results from animal studies and a small clinical trial (Hauser 2003, Jenner 2003).",

A biologic explanation for this observation has not been articulated. One study found that fewer cases with PD had a diagnosis of alcoholism than controls (Benedetti et al., 2000). The variability across studies is great and, overall, the current evidence for an association between alcohol intake and risk of PD is weak. In the Nurses' Health and the Health Professionals' cohorts, no association between incidence of PD and overall alcohol consumption was observed (Hernan et al., 2003); however, an inverse association of beer (but not wine or liquor) consumption was seen. Comparison of alcoholics and non\u2010alcoholics in a large database found comparable PD incidence in both groups (Hernan et al., 2004). Interestingly, in a stratified analysis for men and women separately, male alcoholics had a significantly lower incidence of PD whereas female alcoholics had a twofold increased incidence. Low consumption of alcohol in PD has commonly been attributed to the reserved personality that has been observed prior to PD manifestation (Menza, 2000).",

Hysterectomy with or without an oophorectomy and early menopause were associated with increased risk of PD (OR = 3.36 and 2.18, respectively) and estrogen use after menopause was inversely associated with PD risk (OR = 0.47), although the latter two differences were not statistically significant. Several subsequent case\u2010control studies have similarly suggested that factors associated with estrogen deficiency such as hysterectomy and early menopause may increase PD risk (Currie 2004, Ragonese 2004). Recently, Popat et al. (2005) found that the association of postmenopausal hormone use with PD risk depended on the type of menopause. Among women with history of a hysterectomy with or without an oophorectomy, estrogen use alone was associated with a 2.6\u2010fold increased risk and the risk of PD increased with increasing duration of estrogen use. In contrast, among women with natural menopause, no increased risk of PD was observed with hormone use.",

Women appear to have different risk profiles to at least some of the exposures linked to PD in men, as discussed in previous sections. Although the explanation for these differences is not known, investigation of the combined effects of risk factors may explain some of these differences. For example, in two prospective cohort studies, PD risk was influenced by the combined effects of caffeine consumption and supplemental estrogen use. Women using supplemental estrogens with low caffeine consumption were at a lower risk of PD, but this effect was attenuated or reversed in women who had a high caffeine consumption and were at higher risk of PD (Ascherio 2003, Ascherio 2004). Future studies including populations of women of sufficient size to allow the separate assessment of risk factors in women will be important to clarify the question of gender and PD risk.",

As described previously, several environmental factors, including pesticide and chemical exposure, have been consistently shown to modify the risk for PD in epidemiologic studies. If PD results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, then an interaction of genetic factors with certain exposures could result in a high level of disease risk. For example, increased risk from an environmental toxin could be influenced by the genetically determined level of activity of metabolizing enzymes. Few gene\u2013environment interactions have been investigated. One case\u2010control study suggests that smoking history modifies the effect of family history on the risk for PD, such that the odds ratio is highest in those with a history of smoking and a family history of PD (OR 10.0; Elbaz et al., 2000). This is a surprising finding given the increasing body of evidence that smoking is negatively associated with the occurrence of PD.",

Interactions between xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme genotype and pesticide exposure in the risk of PD have also been studied (Menegon 1998, Taylor 2000). The association between pesticide exposure and PD may be modified by glutathione transferase P1 polymorphisms (Menegon et al., 1998). In a study of 96 patients and 95 controls, no overall difference in the distribution of glutathione S\u2010transferase (GST) P1 genotypes was found between cases and controls. In those with pesticide exposure, however, the GST P1 AA genotype was associated with the lowest risk for PD. Confirmation of each of these observations in additional populations may provide important clues to disease etiology.",

            "text": "An emerging direction of epidemiologic research in PD also deserves mention. Recent work involves investigation of those \u2018at risk\u2019 for PD, before disease is manifest. A variety of disorders may precede formal diagnosis of PD, including olfactory dysfunction, rapid\u2010eye movement sleep behavior disorders, QT or rate\u2010corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation on the electrocardiogram, adiposity and constipation. In vivo imaging of the dopamine transporter with (99mTc)TRODAT\u20101 (TRODAT) and olfactory testing have both been proposed as potential biomarkers in PD, and impaired smell recognition correlated with lower TRODAT uptake (Siderowf et al., 2005). Rapid\u2010eye movement sleep behavior disorder is strongly predictive of PD, and RBD patients have been shown to have impaired olfactory function compared to controls (Stiasny\u2010Kolster et al., 2005). In addition to olfactory dysfunction and rapid\u2010eye movement sleep behavior disorders, a number of patients with PD and multiple system atrophy, have QT or QTc interval prolongation on the electrocardiogram. In one prospective cohort, these findings were highly predictive of PD incidence (LR White, personal communication). Although these QT or QTc interval abnormalities are likely related to autonomic dysfunction, the pathophysiology remains unknown (Deguchi et al., 2002). Other characteristics in midlife associated with increased PD risk include increased triceps skinfold thickness (Abbott et al., 2002) and constipation. Men with less than one bowel movement per day at midlife had a 4.1\u2010fold excess incidence of PD when compared with men with more frequent bowel movements (Abbott et al., 2001). Taken together, these observations suggest that PD may begin decades before nervous system symptoms are observed. PD may be first a disorder of the peripheral autonomic nervous system. If an environmental trigger is involved, the gastrointestinal tract or the olfactory epithelium may be portals of entry. This hypothesis is indirectly supported by neuropathologic findings, suggesting that nigral pathology is a relatively late event in the pathogenesis of PD (Braak et al., 2004). Further studies to identify those at risk will be essential in determining the causes of PD, and methods for its prevention.",

The impact of PD can also be expected to affect disease\u2010associated health expenditures, lost income and personal suffering. As described in this chapter, despite intensive research efforts during the past several decades, the cause (or causes) of typical PD remains unknown. Likely, PD will be understood to be multifactorial, and both genetic and environmental determinants will be important. For example, estimated lifetime penetrance in parkinsonism caused by LRRK2 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is only about 30% (Ozelius et al., 2006). Both genetic and environmental factors may determine expression of this monogenic form of parkinsonism. Typical PD may similarly be due to many different combinations of genetic or environmental determinants. The investigation of possible gene\u2013environment interaction in PD is just beginning. In the next decade, investigations involving careful characterization of genetic and environmental factors will be essential to defining the causes of PD.",
