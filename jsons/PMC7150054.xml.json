The antisense approach utilizes antisense agents to fight various diseases by regulating the expression of a specific factor, the presence of which actually causes that particular disease. Some antisense approaches have evolved over the last few decades, explicitly the introduction of antisense oligonucleotides (AS ODNs) by Stephenson and Zamecnik in the late 1970s [1], the description of ribozymes by Cech and colleagues in the 1980s [2], and the demonstration of short interfering RNA (siRNA) by Fire and Mello in the 1990s [3]. Recently, microRNA (miRNA) replacement therapy has emerged as a new approach to treat human diseases like cancer and various neurodegenerative diseases. Replacement therapy involves the reintroduction of a synthetic version of a natural miRNA that gets depleted in the diseased tissue [4].",

Thus, these are being extensively explored for personalized therapy of cancer, HIV, and other mutating viral diseases [5], [6], [7], [8]. Gene silencing also has a great potential as a chemosensitizing agent to overcome the difficulties of drug resistance and dose-limiting toxicities of chemotherapeutic agents [9]. This technique differs from that used with conventional drugs in that it precisely checks the formation of disease-causing protein by downregulating its expression, rather than relieving the symptoms of the disease after its manifestation. Moreover, this technique can be differentiated from the genetic approach by its action on the mRNA, expressing the disease-causing protein rather than acting on a particular faulty gene. The success of this approach relies on understanding the correct sequence of RNA that carries the protein message responsible for the disease of interest. Fortunately, the completion of the human genome project endows us with a rich source of information on target genes, for the rational design of antisense drugs within hours, for research and clinical trials.\n",

However, this challenge can be met by better understanding of the various formidable barriers encountered, from the site of delivery to the site of action of antisense drugs. Two major limitations, insufficient delivery to target cells and off-target side effects, can be addressed by designing a suitable delivery system, by chemical modifications such as using structural modifications or nanocarriers, or by conjugation with receptor-specific targeting ligands, or combinations thereof [11], [12]. Thus, the purpose of this chapter is to highlight the limitations of antisense agents in therapeutics, the progress made to meet delivery challenges, and the clinical applications of antisense technology. This chapter surveys the agents employed in antisense technologies and discusses the various mechanisms of gene silencing. The emphasis will be on those techniques that employ oligonucleotides composed of both modified and unmodified DNA and/or RNA nucleotides, and another major antisense technology called RNA interference, or RNAi.",

            "text": "It was discovered in the late 1970s that the expression of a specific gene product could be inhibited using a short complementary DNA sequence [1]. This led to intensive research on the antisense approach. In 1978, the concept of antisense technique came into view after the discovery of single-stranded DNA molecules, known as antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (AS ODNs), by Zamecnik and Stephenson [1]. Since then, new applications of antisense technology have continued to develop rapidly. In early developmental stages, blockage of target protein expression was achieved by administering whole DNA or RNA locally as therapeutics [13]. Then, single-stranded DNA molecules (AS ODNs) were first locally administered for the treatment of\ntumors [1]. However, the mechanism of their antitumor activity was never elucidated, and their activity also varied with their size and structure. Compared to studies done on DNA, more extensive research has been reported on using RNA and polyribonucleotides as medicinal agent. In early stages of development, double-stranded polyriboinosine\u2013polyribonocytidine was the most extensively studied polynucleotide [14]. Miller et al. were the first to try modifying the phosphate backbone of oligonucleotides to improve their properties, and they synthesized the first chemically modified oligonucleotide belonging to the class of methyl phosphotriester oligonucleotides [15], [16]. Thereafter, ribozymes, another class of catalytic oligonucleotides, appeared as a new tool to investigate gene expression. Depending on the structure, ribozymes can degrade or modify the target mRNA to produce correct sequence [17], [18]. AS ODNs and ribozymes were already in clinical practice as genetic therapeutics long before small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were developed as potential medicinal agents. In 1992, Fire et al. were the first to describe the RNAi as a mechanism of action of AS ODNs for the destruction of target mRNA [19]. They are a natural cellular defense mechanism, by virtue of which the presence of double-stranded viral DNA triggers the mRNA degradation. Introduction of 20- to 23- nucleotide-long siRNA could exhibit antiviral activity by blocking the expression of viral proteins, which led to the progress of siRNA in therapeutics to block the production of disease-related proteins.",

            "text": "Presently, three decades after the emergence of the antisense concept, the basics of this technology and the key steps to challenges in therapeutics are well comprehensible. The main attention of researchers and pharmaceutical industries today is to make this technology available for its therapeutic applications. Thus, today's focus is not only to design an antisense molecule with good affinity and specificity or to predict its in vivo effect, but also to practically approach its formulation, taking care of the ultimate pharmacological and toxicological aspects at the initial stage of development to avoid rejection at the final clinical phases. Incredible progress has been made in the rational design and appropriate selection of antisense agents, its formulations, delivery carriers, doses, and dosage regimens, and most importantly in the design of preclinical and clinical trials [20], [21], [22]. Since the discovery of antisense technology, there have been numerous advances both in the structure and properties of oligonucleotides used as therapeutic agents. Compared to that of whole DNA or RNA, today RNAi is achieved using siRNA, dsRNA (double-stranded RNA), and shRNA (short hairpin RNA). Several modifications such as novel bases, sugars, conjugates, and chimeric technology have been tried to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these oligonucleotides [11], [12], [20], [21], [22]. Because the biological activity of an AS ODN at the site of action is dependent on factors such as its concentration, concentration of mRNA, rate of synthesis and degradation of mRNA, and the type of terminating mechanism, various strategies have been employed to improve the properties of systemically administered oligonucleotides. Further, a more potent gene therapy, ribozymes, has gained more attention than AS ODNs [23], [24], [25]. Ribozymes are enzymes that cleave single-stranded regions of RNA by transesterification or hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond. To achieve RNAi, either ribozyme-encoding sequences are incorporated into plasmids, or chemically modified minimum ribozyme structure is administered [26]. Chemical modifications have also been tried to synthesize nuclease-resistant ribozyme drugs [27]. Moreover, earlier used AS ODNs exhibit gene silencing after entering the nucleus, but some newer ones and siRNA need not enter the nucleus; this leads to posttranscriptional gene silencing by degrading target mRNA in the cytoplasm itself, making the delivery challenge a little simpler than it was before with AS ODNs [18]. The evolution of different antisense technologies has not closed the path of oglionucelotides; rather the progress and improvements in the oligonucleotides have hastened the pace of newer antisense agents to reach the therapeutic platform. Currently, there is swift progress in systematic research and development, while obviating the downside faced previously by AS ODNs at the earlier growth and clinical steps.",

            "text": "Downregulation of mRNA expression is made possible either via transcriptional arrest of the RNA complementary to the disease-related protein or through the posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) phenomenon. Transcriptional arrest is an alternative to inhibiting mRNA expression by AS ODNs posttranscription. The transcriptional arrest of double-stranded DNA can be achieved by two distinct strategies, namely, strand invasion and triple-strand formation [28]. Until recently, triple-strand formation has been the most commonly used strategy to induce transcriptional arrest. Triple strands are formed by involving Watson\u2013Crick hydrogen bonds between the third strand and the complementary strand of DNA duplex [28]. Homopyrimidine oligonucleotides are capable of inhibiting transcription via triple-strand formation [29], [30]. Several modifications in oligonucleotides have been tried to improve binding to duplex DNA via triplex formation with high affinity and specificity [31], [32], [33]. Strand invasion, though not a widely studied strategy to induce transcriptional arrest, is being used by certain oligonucleotides, such as peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), to inhibit transcription [34]. PTGS is the phenomenon in which antisense agents act through degrading the transcribed target mRNA to prevent translation into the complementary protein (Fig. 7.1\n).",

Within 1 min, nearly 70% of the administered antisense molecule degrades, resulting in low gene silencing [35]. Chemical modifications and use of nonviral vectors can drastically improve the stability of the oligonucleotide toward nucleases in the biological system [18], [36], [37], [38], [39]. Remarkable modifications can be done at the 2\u2032-OH position of pentose sugars and the 3\u2032 half of the siRNA structure. The substitution of sulfur for oxygen to form\nphosphorothioate oligonucleotides is the most common chemical modification to improve stability toward the nucleases [36]. Further, 2\u2032-OH modifications, locked nucleic acids (LNAs), PNAs, morpholino compounds, and hexitol nucleic acids (HNAs) can also improve mRNA stability toward nucleases. In addition, prolonged pharmacological action has been observed after the inclusion of a six-carbon sugar instead of ribose, 2\u2032-F and 2\u2032-OMe modifications, and use of gapmers [18], [36]. Similarly, cationic lipids and polymers readily complex with the anionic antisense molecules by electrostatic interaction, thereby protecting the oligonucleotides from degradation by nucleases [40], [41].",

Nevertheless, particles smaller than 100 nm leak out from the intercellular junction of capillary endothelium to the interstitial space of hepatic sinusoid because of hepatic uptake, and get trapped by the hepatic Kupffer cells there. Colloidal complexes of AS ODN and siRNA with polymers or lipids of high-charge density get destabilized as aggregates due to the presence of negatively charged serum proteins. Both size and charge of these complexes determine their clearance from the circulation [43], [44], [45], [46]. A coating of polyethylene glycol (PEG) helps in making these nanocarrier complexes long circulating by neutralizing the surface charge and imparting a protective hydrophilic sheath around it [47], [48]. Thus, hepatic clearance and the RES uptake of nanocarrier-associated antisense agent can be avoided by carefully monitoring the size and charge of the final complex, which should be around 100 nm and near to neutral respectively, to avoid opsonization. The large uptake of antisense agents by tissues with fenestrated vasculature, liver, and spleen can be beneficial while targeting such molecules to these tissues. Also, oligonucleotides smaller than 5 nm (70 kD in molecular weight) undergo rapid clearance from the body through glomerular filtration. This glomerular filtration can be avoided by manipulating the size of the antisense molecules by incorporating them into a suitable nanocarrier system and attaching with targeting ligands [18].",

The endothelial cells tightly adhere to the underlying extracellular matrix via integrins and to each other via several adhesion molecules, forming tight intercellular junctions with very small intercellular spaces. Small oligonucleotides travel across the endothelium via a paracellular route involving imperfections in these intercellular junctions [49]. However, in certain tissues such as those of the liver and spleen, these endothelial intercellular spaces are relatively larger than in any other body tissue, allowing access of even large oligonucleotides. AS ODNs also traverse across these endothelial cells transcellularly via claveolin-based transcytosis [50]. This transcellular transport is size independent, allowing passage of both small and large oligonucleotide molecules. Cell-penetrating peptides, targeting ligands, or molecular conjugates, can be used to facilitate passage of AS ODNs across endothelial lining [18].",

This nonspecific cellular uptake by nontarget tissues results in severe toxic manifestations due to unwanted protein expression. This nonspecific cellular uptake can be reduced by coating the nonviral vector\u2013AS ODN complexes with PEG and by attaching cell-specific targeting ligands such as transferrin [52], folate [53], surface receptor\u2013specific antibodies [54], and so on. Coupling with membrane-permeable peptides like transportan and penetratin also enhances the cellular internalization [55]. Coating with PEG not only reduces uptake by the RES but also reduces uptake by target cells. Hence, it is more rational to use cell-specific targeting ligands along with PEG coating. However, use of receptor-specific antibodies can evoke immunogenic manifestations. Therefore, these antibodies must be suitably tailored before being used as targeting ligands [56].",

Hence, the transfection efficiency of nonviral vectors depends on cellular internalization as well as the endosomal escape of the active moiety to reach the actual target [57], [58]. Two strategies are widely used to enhance the endosomal escape. The first uses fusogenic lipids or peptides to rupture lysosomal membranes, by forming pores in membranes [59], [60]. A pH-sensitive liposome system, such as Lipofectin, composed of cationic lipids along with a fusogenic helper lipid such as DOPE (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine), has been reported, which readily releases the entrapped oligonucleotides at low-pH environments [61]. Interaction of the cationic lipids of these liposomes with the anionic lipids of the cell membranes (endosomal membrane) results in phase separation, thereby creating DOPE-rich regions that form pores in the membranes, causing membrane destabilization [62], [63]. The second strategy involves using delivery systems that possess high buffering capacity. This prevents acidification of the endosomes, resulting in disruption of the endosomal membrane [64], [65]. Polyethylenimine is used as a buffering agent in such polymer\u2013AS ODN complexes. Also endo-osmolytic agents like chloroquine and a higher concentration of other osmotic agents like glycerol, sucrose, or polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) have been shown to aid osmolysis of endosomes.",

Addition of an anionic lipid can displace negatively charged siRNA or AS ODN from the cationic lipid\u2013polymer-oligonucleotide complex [66], [67]. This release is attributed to the multivalent nature of the anionic lipid and the electrostatic and hydrophilic\u2013hydrophobic interactions of the lipids. This lipid mixing results in charge neutralization, allowing the diffusion of the cationic lipids away from the oligonucleotide. Thus, the anionic lipid competes with the anionic oligonucleotide for the cationic lipid, displacing the oligonucleotide. In the cationic polymer\u2013AS ODN complex, cationic polymers like polyethyleneimine (PEI) or poly-l-lysine (PLL) accelerates nuclear localization by preventing cytosolic degradation of the complex. The extent and duration of the oligonucleotides' response depends upon the step limiting the rate of cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking, endosomal release, and nuclear entry. This step can be controlled by the conjugation of cell-penetrating signal peptides, endosomal release signal peptides, or nuclear localization signal peptides to the oligonucleotides. However, siRNA polyplexes with reducible polymers, such as polyethyleneglycol-poly-l-lysine (PEG-PLL) block copolymers with disulfide crosslinking, are preferred for cytosol-specific degradation, to release siRNA in cytoplasm to act on target mRNA in cytosol [68].",

This resistance is conferred by two distinct mechanisms, namely, innate immunity and adaptive immunity, and presents a major barrier to intracellular AS ODN delivery. An individual is born with innate immunity, which is mediated by receptors that bind to conserved structures called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), common to many pathogens [71]. Thus, innate immunity is of major concern in case of viral vector\u2013based antisense drug delivery. On the other hand, adaptive immunity an individual acquires after birth, on exposure to disease-causing pathogens, and it is mediated by T and B lymphocytes. When a pathogen invades the body, it interacts with specific surface receptors on T and B lymphocytes, causing their activation and production of effector T cells and antibodies that neutralize the pathogen. Many researchers have reported dangerous immune responses with AS ODNs [72]. When phosphorothioates were administered to monkeys as a large, one-time injection, they triggered a systemic and lethal inflammation by activating complement. They also stimulated a dramatic increase in immunoglobulin secretion within 24 h and increased the expression of activation markers such as MHC class II. CpG (cytosine and guanine) separated by phosphate-containing phosphorothioates augment natural killer (NK) cell activity, modulate T cell function, and may stimulate the release of several members of the interleukin family.",

This is the most widely used and validated mechanism for the knockdown of mRNA, resulting in more than 80% reduction in mRNA and protein expression. However, the precise mechanism by which the RNase H enzyme recognizes a duplex has not been elucidated completely. The RNase H cleavage sites are found near the translational initiation codon and the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 untranslated regions. RNase H is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of all cells [74]. Its regular function is to remove RNA primers from Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Hence, oligonucleotides that act via RNase H activation must be designed carefully. Although the requirement for an AS ODN to inhibit a protein expression is not known precisely, modifications in sugar moiety such as sugar type and its orientation are thought to influence RNase H activation [75], [76], [77], [78]. Modifications that result in DNA-like oligonucleotides support RNase H activity, while changes resulting in RNA-like oligonucleotides do not support RNase H activity. Modifications in oligonucleotide backbone also alter RNase H activity [79], [80], [81]. However, the favored design is to use chimeric molecules, such as a single ribonucleotide, which can be bound to its complementary oligonucleotide backbone, which then serves as a substrate for RNase H [36]. These RNase H-dependent oligonucleotides can inhibit protein expression by binding to any region of the complementary mRNA.",

RNAi is an antisense mechanism of action that utilizes the enzyme Dicer to promote hydrolysis of the target RNA. siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes have been reported to inhibit protein expression through RNAi pathway by activation of double-strand RNase [96]. The potency, maximal effectiveness, duration of action, and sequence specificity of siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes have been found to be comparable to those of RNase H-dependent oligonucleotides [97]. Also, the activity of siRNA oligonucleotides has been found to be affected by the secondary structure of the target mRNA. The RNAi pathway (Fig. 7.4\n) involves several complicated steps, which we discuss here in brief [96].1.The process of RNAi is activated by exposure to dsRNA precursors. In the initiation step, in the presence of ATP and RNase-III-type endonucleases, the dsRNA precursors are processed into smaller nucleotides called siRNAs having length from 21 to 23 nucleotides.2.The resulting siRNAs are subsequently incorporated into a multiprotein complex known as the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).3.In the successive step, in the presence of ATP the siRNA molecules undergo unwinding with the aid of helicases, while getting processed into RISC. This activates the complex, leaving only the antisense strand of siRNA associated with the RISC, while the sense strand gets degraded by the exoribonucleases in cytoplasm.4.The activated RISC then directs the siRNA toward its complementary mRNA sequence.5.After binding of siRNA to complementary mRNA sequence, the RISC complex cleaves the target mRNA with the help of Argonaute enzymes associated with the RISC.6.The cleaved mRNA is then degraded by nucleases in the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting the expression of the related protein, while the freed RISC complex recycles to cleave more of the target mRNA sequences.\n",

PNAs are AS ODNs in which the sugar phosphate backbone is replaced completely by polyamide linkages comprising repeating N-(2-aminoethyl)glycine units attached to nucleobases via methylene carbonyl linkers [111], [112]. These possess increased stability and favorable hybridization [113] due to absence of negative charges on the PNA oligomers, but do not support the RNase H antisense mechanism. These exert antisense effect through steric blockade and can bind to both RNA and transcription factors [114], [115]. N3\u2032-P5\u2032 PA morpholino-oligonucleotides are synthesized by substituting the deoxyribose moiety with a morpholino ring, and the charged phosphodiester linkage with a neutral PA linkage [116]. These are biologically stable [117] and possess efficient antisense activity that is RNase H independent. These are comparatively less toxic than first- or second-generation oligonucleotides and show low interaction with plasma proteins. LNA is a new and promising third-generation modification composed of nucleotides that are \u201clocked\u201d into a single conformation via a 2\u2032-O, 4\u2032-C methylene linkage in 1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylene-\u03b1-d-allofuranose [117]. These possess remarkably increased thermodynamic stability and enhanced nucleic acid recognition.\n",

Ribozymes are RNA enzymes having the potential to process RNA and thus can act to knock down the gene expression. Hammerhead ribozyme has been explored extensively for its catalytic efficiency due to the catalytic core in its structure and for its sequence-specific binding capacity to RNA due to two flanking sequences [24], [25]. The structure of hammerhead ribozyme has two regions: a catalytic core for cleavage and two flanking sequences confirming binding and specificity. Shorter flanking sequences of 6\u201310 nucleotides present a more rapid turnover rate. Ribozymes can lead to the activation of RNase degradation through dsRNA recognition [118]. Many ribozyme formulations are under different phases of clinical trials (Table 7.3).",

It is not essential for the aptamers to be complementary to the target mRNA; instead its three-dimensional tertiary and quaternary structures determine the specificity and binding capabilities. Aptamers can be well utilized as nonimmunogenic alternatives of antibodies even at 1000 times higher doses. Aptamers are acquiescent to the amendments that apply to the other nucleotide-based antisense agents. Thus, aptamers can be tailored according to various required modifications while safeguarding their structure, specifically, the binding region [119], [120].",

            "text": "RNAi is more potent than antisense in general and makes selection of a candidate sequence much easier [17], [18], [19], [20]. Mammalian cells have single-stranded RNA, and the introduction of viral long dsRNA (>30 nt) can trigger RNAi and initiate a potent antiviral response by inhibition of protein synthesis through mRNA degradation. This natural defense mechanism has been utilized as an antisense technology to fight a tremendous number of diseases by the introduction or expression of siRNAs [20]. Presence of long dsRNA can trigger the RNAi pathway, which leads to the activation of Dicer enzyme to cut long dsRNA into short RNA fragments called siRNA [118]. These siRNA fragments degrade the complementary mRNA to prevent its expression into undesired protein. siRNAs can be produced chemically as well as enzymatically and introduced directly into the cell with or without minimal interferon response as compared to the long dsRNA. Since 1998, many studies have been executed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of siRNA, and pharmaceutical industries have invested billions on this technology through licensing delivery platforms and strategic alliances in the development of RNAi-based therapeutic products. Initially, the studies were limited to local administration of siRNA for the treatment of topical, specifically ocular, diseases, but presently vigorous efforts are in progress to cover the treatment of almost all the incurable diseases like cancer, hepatitis, AIDS, various other mutating viral diseases, and respiratory disorders, through various routes of administration, including topical, inhalation, and systemic [10], [121], [122], [123], [124], [125], [126], [127]. Increasing figure of products in clinical and preclinical stages is a sign of foreseen breakthrough in pharmaceutical and biotechnology market. Besides siRNA, a few other short RNAs like miRNA and Piwi-associated RNA (piRNA) have also been identified [128]. The folding of long single-stranded RNA sequences (encoded by specific genes and function in repressing mRNA translation or degradation) into intramolecular hairpins containing imperfectly base-paired segments led to the formation of miRNAs. piRNAs are also from the long single-stranded precursors and its function is associated with Piwi subfamily of Argonaute proteins. A large number of tiny noncoding RNAs have been discovered since 1990, and this continues. [126]. Of these, siRNA was first identified because of their potential to regulate gene expression. Recently, miRNAs have been shown to regulate critical biological processes from growth and development, to oncogenesis and host\u2013pathogen interaction in higher eukaryotes. miRNA is a natural molecule, also consisting of dsRNA with short single-stranded ends. Primary miRNA is transcribed from DNA and folds into a hairpin. The Drosha enzyme cuts the hairpin from the rest of the transcript, forming pre-miRNA. The Dicer enzyme cuts away the loop, forming the mature double-stranded miRNA. The double strand loads onto a ribonucleoprotein complex (miRNP), which includes the Argonaute protein, and Argonaute cleaves one strand of the dsRNA, incorporating the uncleaved single strand into the mature complex. This complex inhibits translation of partially complementary mRNA [128], [129], [130].",

Each can cleave perfectly complementary mRNA targets and decrease the expression of partially complementary targets. However, the major difference between endogenous siRNA and miRNA (Table 7.5\n) seems to be that the precursor of endogenous siRNA is a long dsRNA, whereas the precursor of a miRNA is hairpin-shaped RNA.",

They have the potential to arise from foldback structures characteristic of miRNA precursor hairpins. siRNAs are similar small RNAs that do not appear to correspond to protein-coding regions and do not have the potential to arise from hairpins characteristic of miRNA precursors, and yet they are expressed at sufficiently high endogenous levels to be detected on RNA blots; there is a theory that they might be processed from long dsRNA. As progress is made in understanding the role of miRNA in biological milieu, these therapeutic molecules are promising for targeting various diseases, including various neurodegenerative diseases that do not yet have any effective therapies and conventional druggable targets. However, traditional antisense and novel siRNA oligonucleotides or miRNA all typically need chemical modifications and formulation into clinically suitable, safe, and effective drug delivery vehicles for stability and tissue targeting. To achieve this, it is essential to understand the in vivo effect of these molecules.\n",

            "text": "AS ODNs are designed specifically and selectively to inhibit translation of target mRNA and expression of related protein [137], [138]. To elucidate the safety of AS ODNs, their biological activity as a function of dose, rate of distribution, and mechanism of clearance from the body must be established. Because phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were the first synthetically prepared antisense nucleotides, their pharmacokinetics, and hence their efficacy and safety, has been widely studied and reported [134], [135], [136]. Their pharmacokinetics has been found to be independent of their physical and chemical properties. Following injection, AS ODNs bind to various proteins, distribute to various tissues, and finally get cleared from the body. The kidney, liver, and other organs of the RES are the major organs of distribution for AS ODNs and siRNA [135], [136], [137], and have benefitted from their ability to target to these sites. Certain siRNA formulations also accumulate in subcutaneous tumors through enhanced permeability and retention due to their leaky vasculature [135]. The reported data demonstrate that the pattern of absorption, distribution, and clearance of phosphorothioates in various species such as mouse, rat, dog, and monkey is similar and independent of oligonucleotide sequence and route of administration [135], [136], [137], [138], [139]. With intravenous administration, the concentration of oligonucleotides in plasma decreases rapidly, with distribution half lives of 30\u201380 min, whereas with intravenous infusion, oligonucleotide concentration [134], [136] increases linearly as the dose increases [140]. Intravenous administration of oligonucleotides also bypasses the absorption barriers to antisense drug delivery, usually encountered with other routes of administrations. However, rapid intravenous injection results in hemolytic effects due to high local concentrations of oligonucleotides. Hence, slow intravenous administration is advantageous over rapid injection. When considering tissue distribution of phosphothiorate (PS) oligonucleotides, highest concentrations are found in the liver and kidney, followed by the spleen and lymph nodes [140], [141], [142]. Tissue uptake of these oligonucleotides can be readily increased using long-term continuous infusion, which extends the exposure of PS oligonucleotides to the target tissues. However, their clearance from the organs of distribution is relatively slow, requiring a 3-times-a-week treatment regime, thereby ensuring an enhanced biological effect.",

The metabolism of many AS ODNs follows the same pathway as the endogenous nucleic acids. Immediately following intravenous administration, 35% of the AS ODN degrades within 10 min [140]. In tissue metabolism, the metabolites, being smaller, excrete more slowly than the parent oligonucleotide [144].

This protein binding is a nonspecific electrostatic interaction dependent on salt type and pH of the surrounding biological milieu. The PS oligonucleotides have been reported to bind to \u03b12-macroglobuline with higher affinity than albumin. These oligonucleotides have also been reported to bind to other plasma proteins as well, but with lower affinity, and binding of the PS oligonucleotides to the thrombin-binding sites of these plasma proteins results in severe hematological risks [146]. However, this protein binding of PS oligonucleotides has been found to be reversible and to occur both in plasma and tissues. Tissue distribution of these oligonucleotides has been attributed to the protein binding within the organ and on the cell surface, constituting the organ resulting in higher tissue uptake of oligonucleotides. Thus, a decrease in protein binding of oligonucleotides results in a decreased tissue disposition and an increased urinary excretion. Certain drugs such as aspirin have been reported to displace PS oligonucleotides from plasma proteins, increasing their rate of excretion and decreasing the magnitude of their biological effect [147].",

Neutral lipids are used to facilitate fusion with cell membranes. The cationic lipids widely used in formulating cationic liposomes include DOTAP (1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane) and DOTMA (1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane) [12], [157], [159]. However, lipoplexes, along with cationic lipids, contain anionic amphiphilic molecules, facilitating the release of negatively charged oligonucleotides from the lipoplex, thus assisting in nuclear localization of oligonucleotides [12], [160], [161], [162]. Overall neutral charge of the formulation reduces the biological toxic effects of cationic lipids Lipofectin RNAifect, Oligofectamine, Lipofectamine, TransIT TKO, synthetically cationized cholesterol, and natural analogues of cardiolipin are the most widely explored lipids for improving the delivery, safety, and efficacy of antisense drugs [12], [160]. Thiocholesterol-based cationic lipids have been used as components in self-assembled cationic micelles and nanolipoparticles, which can efficiently entrap anionic oligonucleotides and deliver them intracellularly [12], [157], [163].

Many authors have also reported chitosan-based nanoparticles for antisense drug delivery [12], [157], [162], [168]. Cyclodextrin-based nanoparticles have also been developed by Mark Davis for efficient intracellular siRNA delivery to tumors, and this has recently been approved by the FDA [169].

When placed in aqueous media, hydrogels swell to form insoluble three-dimensional networks via chemical crosslinks (tie-points, junctions) or physical crosslinks, such as entanglements or crystallites. These networks are composed of either homopolymers or copolymers and are used to control drug release in reservoir-based or controlled release systems or as carriers in swelling-controlled release devices. Hydrogels can be used to modulate antisense drug release in response to pH, temperature, ionic strength, electric field, or specific analyte concentration differences, thus making them enviro-intelligent and stimuli-sensitive delivery systems [162]. Antisense activity of oligonucleotides immobilized in a cationic crosslinked poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and PEI nanogel has been evaluated in a cell model [180]. A poly[1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone-co-(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)] hydrogel has been reported as a potential carrier for AS ODNs [181]. Also, cationic agarose-based hydrogel has been developed to deliver AS ODNs targeting the mRNA of TNF-\u03b1 for the prevention of arthritis in animal models [182]. In hydrogels, release can be designed to occur within specific areas of the body (e.g., within a certain pH of the digestive tract or within cancerous cells) and also to specific sites (using adhesive or cell-receptor specific gels with modified hydrogel surface). Hydrogels can be prepared from polymers like polyacrylic acid, pluronic, PEI, PEG, agarose, etc. [162], [168], [180], [181], [182], [183].\n",

Hydrodynamic renal vein injection of an AS ODN against connective tissue growth factor has been reported to treat renal fibrosis in rats [185].

However, the technique has limited use because of high cell mortality and suffers from drawbacks such as difficulty in transfecting cells in a large area of tissues due to a limited effective range of approximately 1 cm between the electrodes. Furthermore, surgery is required to place the electrodes into deep-seated organs. Process parameters like voltage, length, and number of electric pulses can be optimized to get maximum transfection with minimum cell mortality.",

Monroe et al. and Coll et al. described the photocaging spatiotemporal strategy, which makes use of a photolytic chromophore for rapid release of a biologically active substrate on exposure to light [190], [191]. This caging involves covalent attachment of photolabile compounds to effector nucleic acid species that block the bioactivity until triggered by near-ultraviolet light. Photocaging also protects the effector nucleic acid from nuclease and blocks its native bioactivity until exposed to near-ultraviolet light. This phenomenon was first used by Kaplan et al. to release an inducer in the biological environment [192]. The various types of cage compounds commonly used with an effector nucleic acid are summarized in Fig. 7.7\n.",

Some ocular diseases can be treated by intravitreal injection of antisense agents to treat eye diseases like AMD, inhibition of ocular neurovascularization, and angiogenesis [199], [200], [201], [202]. An AS ODN formulation, Vitravene, is available in the market for the treatment of retinitis. siRNA is also being evaluated as an inhalation therapy for lung disorders and systemic applications [203]. Moreover, intranasal administration of siRNA has been investigated in rodents for targeting heme oxygenase-1 to enhance ischemia-reperfusion-induced lung apoptosis and for the treatment of respiratory virus infection [8].

            "text": "AS ODNs are now being widely used in basic research to elucidate the general splicing patterns of various genes, which in turn may help in treating genetic disorders [99], [208]. Oligonucleotides splice out specific introns from a pre-mRNA by interfering with the assembly of a spliceosome. A spliceosome is complex comprising various proteins and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and is formed for each splicing event. Thus, AS ODNs can be used to elucidate the various pathways involved in the synthesis of a protein and to determine the various possible mutagenic splicing sites alterations that result in inappropriate protein production. In genetic disorders, point mutations result in new splice sites within the introns, directing the splicing machinery to rupture the splicing pathways, resulting in the formation of a defective mRNA and an inappropriate protein product [209]. Blocking of these splice sites using AS ODNs thus prevents inappropriate protein expression. However, oligonucleotides must not activate RNase H enzyme when used to alter these splicing patterns. This is usually achieved by inducing certain chemical modifications in the AS ODNs such that the oligonucleotide RNA duplex is not recognized by the RNase H [210]. Examples of such enzymes include methylphosphonate derivatives, O-alkyl oligonucleotides, and PNAs [211]. Using antisense technology, O-alkyl oligonucleotides or morpholino-oligonucleotides have been reported to treat genetic blood disorder \u03b2-thelassemia completely [212], [213].",

This technology has been successfully used to study central nervous system (CNS) proteins such as transmembrane receptors, ion channels, transporters, G proteins, and growth factors [214]. Many of these belong to large families with closely related subtypes and isoforms are generally nondistinguishable using common assay techniques. By using AS ODNs that can bind to one specific subtype, however, it is possible to distinguish them, as a sufficient degree of diversity exists in the mRNA sequences of these closely related proteins. Phosphodiester oligonucleotides exhibit considerably more stability in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) than in plasma but require frequent administrations in large quantity to obtain significant antisense inhibitory effects [215]. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, though having good stability in CSF and producing the desired antisense effect, are quite toxic [216], [217]. AS ODNs exert their inhibitory effect through RNase H mechanisms in the brain [218]. PNAs and LNAs have also been tried to inhibit inappropriate protein expression [219], [220]. As AS ODNs cannot readily cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, invasive methods such as intraventricular, intraparenchymal, and intrathecal administrations have also been tried to deliver AS ODNs to the brain, but these result in tissue injury and hemorrhage [142], [221]. Antisense technology has been reported to treat brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease [222], [223], pain [224], [225], and affective disorders [226] successfully.",

Inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase enzyme is the molecular target for the treatment of diseases like Alzheimer's disease [227] and myasthenia gravis [228]. Advances in research concerning Alzheimer's disease and myasthenia gravis have demonstrated alternative splicing variants of acetyl cholinesterase enzyme being involved in the etiology of these diseases. Thus, only AS ODN therapy could be useful in the management of these diseases. AS ODNs have also been used successfully to characterize the various members of D2 dopamine receptors [229]. This technology has also been employed to differentiate between different opioid receptors viz. mu, delta, and kappa [230]. Similarly, AS ODNs have been successfully utilized to study the various phosphatases involved in cellular growth\u2013control pathways and thus help in the screening of potential anticancerous agents [231], [232], [233]. These enzymes regulate diverse cellular processes such as metabolism, ion-channel activity, and membrane transport as well as learning and memory. Thus, inhibition of many protein kinases using AS ODNs have been used to treat related disorders in humans.",

When inflammation is deregulated, disease or even death can happen. In acute inflammatory processes cells like eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages migrate to the site of injury in response to chemotactic factors such as platelet-activating factor, leukotrienes, and cytokines. In inflammation, antisense technology can be used to demonstrate the relative importance of various signaling components at the molecular level in a controlled manner. Hence, this technology is useful both in defining the role of a particular mediator in the process of inflammation and in the screening of potential anti-inflammatory drugs [138], [234], [235]. The technology has been reported to downregulate successfully the molecular targets involved in various inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease [236], inflammatory bowel disease [237], renal allograft rejection [238], and psoriasis [239].",

Several reports document the role of the tissue kallikrein-kinin system in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Reduced urinary kallikrein has been observed in hypertensive subjects. Hence, systemic delivery of the human tissue kallikrein gene results in a decrease in blood pressure and may assuage even glomerular sclerosis [253], [254]. However, antisense technology has been successfully used to elucidate the role of tissue kallikrein-kinin system in blood pressure regulation. Intracerebroventricular injection of AS ODNs against kininogen mRNA or bradykinin B2-receptor mRNA results in an increase in blood pressure. However, injection of antisense against the B1-receptor causes a decrease in blood pressure. Thus, antisense technology is useful in elucidating the role of bradykinin B1 and B2 receptors in the central regulation of blood pressure [253].",

A rational strategy to fight against viral diseases is to inhibit the genes implicated in various viral infections with the help of AS ODNs. Antisense technology can be easily applied to viruses as they encode unique proteins, very different from the ones encoded by normal cells. Vitravene\u00ae (fomivirsen) was the first antiviral AS ODN used intravitreally to treat cytomegalovirus retinitis [10]. The various viruses being investigated as potential targets of antisense drugs include human papillomavirus [255], human immunodeficiency virus-2 (HIV-2) [256], hepatitis-B virus [257], influenza A virus [258], and herpes simplex virus (HSV) [259]. Traditional antiviral drugs are competitive antagonists binding to the disease-causing proteins and subsequently blocking the actions of natural agonists, resulting in toxicological manifestations. Viral proteins essential for the replication of viruses are the prime targets of these antisense drugs. AS ODNs, being selective and specific, readily bind to the target mRNA sequence, thereby downregulating the expression of related proteins and causing the death of the virus.",

Thus, a drug effective at a particular time will not be effective for the next viral mutation. siRNA can be designed according to the particular gene mutation; moreover, a pool of more than one mutant-specific siRNA can be incorporated in a single delivery agent for delivering at one time [18].\n\u2022Once a carrier is approved for siRNA delivery, different mutant-specific siRNAs can be formulated without changing the carrier system [5].\u2022Cancer-like diseases are highly patient specific. Thus, siRNA can be explored as personalized therapy to benefit an individual patient [5].\u2022Antisense drugs have the potential to act as a chemosensitizing agent and can prevent multidrug resistance by blocking the resistance-causing component [9].\n",

In fact, liposomes, polyconjugates, and other biodegradable polymeric carriers have emerged as the leading platform for the systemic delivery of RNAi therapeutics and offer considerable promise for diseases of the liver, solid cancers, as well as potentially enhanced vaccines, infectious diseases, and immune cell-related disorders. Because the drugs based on liposomal and biodegradable polymeric carriers systems are already on the market, a big leap forward should occur toward the development of polymer- and liposome-based RNAi formulations to make a swift and safer dosage form; from a regulatory perspective. An attention toward the development of an attractive and feasible field of RNAi-based vaccines is also the need of the hour. Many flu vaccines, like that for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), swine flu, and its further mutating varieties, can be developed and put into one pool to cover the closer probable mutations of the existing mutant variety in a single formulation. Because these antisense formulations can have potential side effects and can lose their viability in the biological milieu, extensive but satisfactory pharmacological and toxicological studies should be performed at the initial development and preclinical stages so as to avoid failures at the later clinical phases. Many experiments and evaluations have already been performed on the eldest antisense technology of oligonucleotides. Thus, all the shortcomings and profits from such studies should be taken into account while developing newer antisense-based formulations. Highly specific agents like siRNA can boom as agents for individualized therapies. Principal companies that are actively involved in RNAi-based therapeutics should focus on investing in developing these as personalized therapeutic agents for patients suffering from either major disorders or rare ones that have occurred because of an individual-specific gene defect or mutation. As a potent agent effective at very low doses, siRNA is a strikingly suitable agent to be delivered via inhalation route. Also many studies done on inhalation of various genes can support the development of stable and effective aerosolizable or nebulizable siRNA formulations. Simplicity of siRNA design, its specificity, potency, availability of human genome information, feasibility of fabrication into required sequence, and applications for an endless number of disease-related expressions\noffers the broadest application in almost every area of therapeutics. Thus, these features should be sincerely evaluated through specialized distribution of antisense-oriented research to various respected companies, industries, and institutes. We request their required collaboration, cooperation, and support of one another in order to present this long-awaited technology as a practically available therapy to humankind.",
