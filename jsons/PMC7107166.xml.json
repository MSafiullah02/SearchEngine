In many countries HCAI (of patients) is subject to mandatory surveillance, reporting and analysis of potentially remediable risk factors. In some countries (such as the UK), healthcare institutions are subject to a variety of penalties when HCAI targets are breached or preventive standards are deemed to fall below acceptable levels. By contrast, there is no mandatory surveillance and no formal system of reporting of HCAI of healthcare workers (HCWs), and the analysis of remediable risk factors for occupationally acquired infectious diseases is exceptional rather than routine in the majority of healthcare systems.",

A more recent review of the literature suggests that the risk of TB is higher in HCWs than the general population with an incidence rate ratio of 2.0 in low-incidence countries rising to over 5 in high-incidence countries (Baussano et al., 2011). The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that \u2018Among 35 million health workers worldwide, about 3 million receive percutaneous exposures to blood-borne pathogens each year\u2019 (World Health Organization, 2003).

Advice from Infectious Diseases and Virology experts was that the travel history made the diagnosis of Ebola unlikely. It was also agreed that samples should be sent to a national reference laboratory for tests to include Ebola. Several hours ensued before relevant laboratories and appropriate courier services could be organized. Meanwhile, the patient remained clinically stable, but was increasingly concerned about the lack of communication and apparent anxiety of the departmental staff.

Many HCWs have no special training in infectious diseases and rely heavily on their employing institutions to communicate risks and assure their personal safety. Individual HCWs do not (generally) hold substantive responsibility for the cooperative action required to control the spread of infectious diseases. Surveillance and the implementation of risk mitigation measures require cooperative action. An outbreak is rarely curtailed by the actions of a single HCW. It is the engagement of multiple actors in coordinated action, often decided at a distance from the point of risk that determines the degree of risk. In the case of infectious disease, the adequacy of the coordinated response determines the risk to which an HCW, patients and community contacts are exposed. Individuals have little control of infrastructure, facilities, work-load, communication, training or teaching within the institutional context.",
