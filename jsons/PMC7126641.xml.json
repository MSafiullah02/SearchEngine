            "text": "Nodaviruses are small, nonenveloped, spherical viruses with bipartite positive-sense RNA genomes, which are capped but not polyadenylated. Two genera have been distinguished in the Nodaviridae family: alphanodaviruses, which are originally isolated from insects and betanodaviruses, which usually infect a wide variety of larval and juvenile marine fish Ball 1994, Ball et al 2000. Similar to alphanodaviruses, the genome of betanodaviruses has two coencapsidated genomic RNA segments (RNAs 1 and 2), both of which are required for infectivity. RNA1 encodes protein A, which is the viral component of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). RNA2 encodes protein \u03b1, a proteolytic precursor of viral capsid proteins. A subgenomic RNA3 is synthesized during RNA replication from 3\u2032 terminus of RNA1 and encodes one or two small proteins (B1 and B2) with unknown functions. As a member of betanodaviruses, the complete sequence of greasy grouper (Epinephelus tauvina) nervous necrosis viruses (GGNNV) of Singapore strain has been determined in our laboratory. The complete nucleotide sequence of RNA1 is 3103 nucleotides containing an ORF of 982 aa and the RNA2 is 1433 nucleotides containing an ORF of 338 aa (Tan et al., 2001). RNA2 encodes a 37-kDa capsid protein whose recombinant protein \u03b1 could be used as a sensitive reagent to diagnosis GGNNV infection (Huang et al., 2001). In our previous work, GGNNV was demonstrated to be capable of inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis in GGNNV-infected SB cells and protein \u03b1 was a possible apoptotic inducer in transfected cells (data not shown).",

However, more and more exogenous nonribosomal proteins were demonstrated to be transported to the nucleolus under certain conditions. Proteins from porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Rowland et al., 1999), Semliki Forest virus (Favre et al., 1994), coronavirus (Hiscox et al., 2001), and Borna disease virus (Pyper et al., 1998) have been reported to localize in the nucleolus and to get involved with various aspects of virus replication. It has been found that a cluster of basic amino acids could lead proteins to the nuclear or nucleolus (Kaffman and O\u2019Shea, 1999).",

In this study, the protein \u03b1 of GGNNV could be detected in both nucleolus and cytoplasm of SB cells infected by GGNNV and SB and Cos-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/RNA2. The ORF of protein \u03b1 was then fused with EGFP and transfected to the SB and Cos-7 cells to study its subcellular localization. It was found that the GGNNV protein \u03b1 could direct the EGFP to the nucleolus of both SB and Cos-7 cells. Employing a series of deletion mutations, the N-terminal amino acid residues 23RRRANNRRR31 were identified as a nucleolus localization signal which functioned in both fish and mammalian cells, indicating that there is a conserved mechanism for nucleolus localization in both cells.",

EGFP/RNA2/N90 (data not shown), EGFP/RNA2/N78 (data not shown), and EGFP/RNA2/N43 (Fig. 3B, image a) showed the same distribution in Cos-7 cells; that is, at 36 h posttransfection, most protein was distributed in the cytoplasm and only background signal was observed in the nucleoplasm, but was completely excluded from nucleoli. However, the expression image of EGFP/RNA2/C39 (Fig. 3B, image g) was the same as that of wild-type EGFP-\u03b1 fusion protein. The indirect IFA with antiprotein \u03b1 sera further demonstrated the localization of EGFP/RNA2/N43 and EGFP/RNA2/C39 in transfected Cos-7 cells. The merged image (Fig. 3B, image f) of EGFP/RNA2/N43 fusion protein (Fig. 3B, image d, green) and red image of antiprotein \u03b1 sera (Fig. 3B, image e) showed empty nucleoli.

To further confirm the nucleolar localization of EGFP/43aa observed by confocal microscopy, Cos-7 cells expressing EGFP/43aa was fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear component and mAb against GFP was used in Western blot assay. EGFP-43aa fusion protein was not detected in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 5, lane 3), whereas in the nuclear fraction, the EGFP-43aa fusion protein was in high concentration (Fig. 5, lane 1). However, EGFP as a control was found in both cytoplasmic (Fig. 5, lane 4) and nuclear fraction (Fig. 5, lane 2). There was more EGFP in cytoplasmic extract than in nuclear fraction. Antinucleolin mAb was used as a control to test the fidelity of the subcellular fractionations from nuclear (Fig. 5, lane 6) and cytoplasm (Fig. 5, lane 5).

After 36 h transfection, the fluorescent signal was viewed in cytoplasm, but not in the nucleolus (Fig. 6B, images ai, di, and gi).

We transiently expressed those different deletion mutants which functioned in Cos-7 cells into SB cells. The distribution of EGFP fusion proteins showed a similar pattern, as we predicted. At 36 h posttransfection, EGFP-RNA2/N43 was distributed in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm except the nucleolus (Fig. 7, image a) and EGFP/43aa was enriched in the nucleolus (Fig. 7, image d). Following the deletion amino acids of 23RRR25 (Fig. 7, image g), 29RRR31 (Fig. 7, image j), or 23RRRANNRRR31 (Fig. 7, image m) from protein \u03b1, the localization of EGFP-\u03b1 fusion protein disappeared from the nucleoli. In addition, DAPI staining was carried out to show the nuclear in blue (Fig. 7, images b, e, h, k, and n). These observations demonstrated that the nucleolus localization signal 23RRRANNRRR31 identified in Cos-7 cells played the same important role in betanodavirus GGNNV host SB cells.",

Nucleoli are present when cells are in interphase (Alberts et al., 1994). In the present study, at various time points, about 10% of infected or transfected cells exhibited nucleolus and cytoplasmic localization of GGNNV protein \u03b1. A possible reason for this observation could be that the fewer infected or transfected cells are at interphase, which showed localization of GGNNV protein \u03b1 to the nucleolus, whereas other cells are in other phases of mitosis. Hiscox et al., (2001) also reported fewer cells with nucleolus localization of IBV N protein. However, mitosis alone cannot account for the absence of protein \u03b1 from the nucleoli in the majority of infected or transfected cells, which suggests that localization of GGNNV protein \u03b1 to the nucleoli might be dependent on particular events of the cycle that the infected or transfected cell is undergoing.",

Proteins less than 40 kDa are able to enter the nucleus by passive diffusion; others generally require a specific nuclear localization signal (NLS), which is ATP dependent. NLSs have been identified for a number of viral and cellular proteins which have been classified as either monopartite or bipartite, depending on whether or not stretches of basic residues are interrupted by a 10 amino acid space region (Garcia-Bustos et al., 1991). Recently, several sequences have been defined as nucleolus localization signals. They consisted of clustered basic Arg/Lys residues and also functioned as nuclear transporting signals Kubota et al 1996, Siomi et al 1988, Goatley et al 1999, Zhu et al 1999. In this study, EGFP was used to study the subcellular localization of protein \u03b1 and search for its NoLS. EGFP-\u03b1 fusion protein with a mass of 67 kDa could not be expected to diffuse into the nucleoplasm unless it contained an NLS/NoLS. The results of subcellular fraction analysis indicate that EGFP protein can diffuse to the nucleus, but its concentration in the nuclear extract is low. However, when EGFP was fused with N-terminal 43 aa of protein \u03b1, the fusion protein was mostly detected in the nuclear extract. So, we predicted that there must be a nucleolus localization signal in the 43 aa which contributes to the nucleolar localization of EGFP/43aa. There are two groups of basic amino acids in the N-terminal amino acids of protein \u03b1: 2RKGEKKLAK10 and 23RRRANNRRR31, which resembled nucleolar localization signals that have been described in other viral and cellular proteins. The distribution of the deletion mutants of protein \u03b1 in transfected cells demonstrated that 23RRRANNRRR31 is a nucleolus localization signal. In this study, nucleolus localization signal of protein \u03b1 was first identified in betanodaviruses, which may yield new insights into the mechanism of betanodaviruses infection. When 23RRR25 or 29RRR31 or 23RRRANNRRR31 was deleted from protein \u03b1, EGFP fusion protein, which is too large (>40 kDa) to pass through the nuclear pore complexes by simple diffusion, was still observed in the nucleus. However, when the N-terminal 43 aa was deleted from protein \u03b1, EGFP/RNA2/N43 disappeared from the nucleus. These observations led to the possible suggestion that the protein \u03b1 may contain other signals within 43 aa, such as 2RKGEKKLAK10, to be involved in its nuclear localization in the transfected and infected SB cells.",

            "text": "The mechanism of nucleolar localization of exogenous proteins depends on their nucleolar localization signals to bind either to an acid region in the nucleolus such as B23, or to rRNA, or to ribosome proteins Li 1997, Kubota et al 1999, Roller et al 1996, Gorlich and Kutay 1999. B23 may serve as a shuttle for the import of protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus coupled to the export of viral mRNA (Qiu and Brown, 1999). The nucleolin binding activity of hepatitis delta antigens (HDAgs) contributes to nucleolar localization and the modulation of the HDV replication (Lee et al., 1998). Many other RNA viruses make use of their RNA-binding proteins to localize into nucleolus to promote disassembly and assembly of the virus particle, such as the RNA-binding proteins in coronavirus (Hiscox et al., 2001), alphaviruses (Wengler, 1984), and alphanodaviruses (Hiscox and Ball, 1997). Nucleocapsids of Semliki Forest virus bind to 28srRNA to facilitate the release of the viral RNA genome (Rikkonen et al., 1992). Through the nucleoli of host cell, virus proteins appear to be involved in viral disassembly replication and assembly as well as in transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. The nucleolus localization proteins ICP27 (Mears et al., 1995) and US11 (Roller et al., 1996) of HSV-1 are involved in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by binding ribosomal 60s subunit. Although the mechanism by which the betanodavirus protein \u03b1 was transported to the nucleolus was not elucidated in this study, the nucleolar localization signal in betanodavirus protein \u03b1 has been demonstrated. The expression of protein \u03b1 was detected in both nucleolus and cytoplasm of transfected and infected cells. Based on this we speculate that by using the nucleolus localization signal 23RRRANNRRR31, protein \u03b1 as the precursor of capsid protein could be imported to the nucleolus by a certain \u201ccarrier.\u201d Similar to nuclear import, export of a protein depends on the presence of a specific nuclear export signal (NES) (Gorlich and Kutay, 1999). These NES are short sequences characterized as being rich in leucine residues and have been identified in a variety of different proteins, the best study of which being the HIV Rev protein (Pollard and Malim, 1998). Protein \u03b1 was detected in both nucleolus and cytoplasm. Possibly the regions other than 1\u201343 amino acids might be NES to be involved in its nuclear export, which could explain the observed cytoplasmic localization in this study. However, by analyzing amino acids of protein \u03b1, we were unable to definitely identify specific NES motifs in protein \u03b1. Two different possibilities exist that explain the failure in our identification of protein \u03b1 NES. First, the NES has an unusual sequence that was not identified by initial sequence homology comparisons to known NES. Second, protein \u03b1 may in fact lack a NES but is exported from the nucleus in complex with another NES-containing protein. Additional studies will be necessary to examine the mechanism of protein \u03b1 shuttle between nucleolus and cytoplasm.",

Localization of bax to nucleoli played a role in apoptosis-induction of glioma cells (Joy et al., 2000). DEDD was involved in apoptosis caused by CD95 (Stegh et al., 1998). In our previous work, protein \u03b1 was found to induce apoptosis in transfected SB and Cos-7 cells. Although protein \u03b1 failed to localize to the nucleolus when amino acids 23RRRANNRRR31 were deleted, the apoptosis could not be prevented in transfected SB and Cos-7 cells (data not shown), indicating there is no relationship between nucleolus localization of protein \u03b1 and its ability to induce apoptosis. Since protein \u03b1 is located in both cytoplasm and nucleolus in transfected and infected cells, its cytoplasm localization might be involved in its apoptosis.",
