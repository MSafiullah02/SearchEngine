The association of sub-fertility and lactation can be regarded as a product of the homeorhetic changes necessary to support milk production, thus directly affecting reproductive tissues. Greater milk production has been associated with physiological changes that can reduce fertility such as accentuated negative energy balance (Wathes et al., 2007), lower concentrations of progesterone and estradiol in plasma (Wiltbank et al., 2006), and disruption of the growth hormone\u2013IGF-1 axis in the liver early postpartum (Kobayashi et al., 1999). Lactating dairy cows have relatively high fertilization rate of around 80 to 90%, but only about 35% are diagnosed pregnant after 60 d of gestation (Santos et al., 2004; Sartori et al., 2010). The basic mechanisms that lead to this massive embryonic and fetal loss observed is not clearly understood at the molecular and cellular levels.",

From fertilization to term, several molecules and systems apparently work in synchrony to receive and maintain the conceptus. Interferon-\u03c4 is synthesized by the trophectoderm cells of the conceptus and is essential for the maintenance of the corpus luteum (CL) during pregnancy (Hansen et al., 1985). Interferon-\u03c4 (IFNT) induces an array of changes in the uterus by promoting the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG; Spencer et al., 2008). In addition to the ISG, genes related to cell remodeling, adhesion and invasion, cell orientation and polarization, angiogenesis, and transporters of glucose and lipids are mostly upregulated by pregnancy and progesterone (Bauersachs et al., 2006; Forde et al., 2010).",

(2009) observed a greater expression of HST70 and IFNT in embryos recovered from heifers than from lactating cows, indicating molecular evidence of the effects of lactation in d-7 embryos. The differential gene expression in a d-7 embryo caused by lactation status is likely to be partly mediated by changes in the endometrium. As evidenced by the complexity and synchrony of events occurring in the endometrium in the presence of a conceptus, it is reasonable to believe that homeorhetic changes that come with initiation of milk production would affect one or, more likely, several genes and pathways in the endometrium crucial to a successful pregnancy. A previous report described genome-wide changes in the liver caused by nutritionally induced ketosis (Loor et al., 2007), demonstrating changes in response to alterations in energy balance of lactating dairy cows. It was one of the first reports to address global transcriptome changes with the scope targeted at cows with lactation-related effects as the primary objective of the study. Considering that lactation could potentially affect many genes or functional groups of interest in the endometrium, the use of a microarray fit the goals of the current study. The objectives were to determine the effect of lactation and pregnancy on the endometrium transcriptome. It was also our priority to unveil global changes caused by lactation that could be closely related to the changes induced by the presence of the conceptus in the endometrium.",

Heifers were evaluated for pregnancy and vaccinated against leptospirosis (Spirovac L5, Pfizer Animal Health, New York, NY) and major viruses (bovine rhinotracheitis virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza-3 virus; Cattlemaster 4, Pfizer Animal Health) upon arrival. Cows were vaccinated again at 8 wk before expected date of calving against bovine rotavirus (serotypes G6 and G10), bovine coronavirus, enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens type C (Scourguard 4KC, Pfizer Animal Health), and against E. coli mastitis (J-Vac, Merial Ltd., Duluth, GA). All heifers were housed in a single sod-based pen with shade at around 3 wk before expected calving and moved after calving to a freestall barn equipped with fans and sprinklers that were automatically turned on when ambient temperature reached 26.7\u00b0C. All cows were fed the same ration (1.51 Mcal of NEL/kg, 15.2% CP) once daily in the prepartum period. After calving, cows were assigned randomly into 2 treatment groups, nonlactating (NL) and lactating (L), and moved to the freestall facility. The NL heifers were dried off immediately (i.e., not milked) after calving, whereas the L cows were milked twice daily.",

Reports (Bauersachs et al., 2006; Spencer et al., 2008; Forde et al., 2011) have described several genes and the complexity to understand the variety of functions that are affected by different stages of the estrous cycle and the presence of the conceptus. The IFN-\u03c4 synthesized by trophectoderm is the main signal needed to block the PGF2\u03b1 cascade (Thatcher et al., 1989; Spencer and Bazer, 2004), but it also promotes the regulation of a great number of ISG involved in cell adhesion, angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, immune function, metabolic processes, and others (Bauersachs et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007\nSpencer et al., 2008; Mansouri-Attia et al., 2009; Forde et al., 2010; Walker et al., 2010).

A great portion of these genes (the vast majority upregulated by pregnancy) were in fact ISG genes, such as MX1, MX2, B2M, ISG12, ISG15, ISG20, IFN regulatory factors (IRF1, IRF3, IRF5, IRF6, IRF7, IRF8, IRF9),IFIH1, chemokines (CCL2, CCL8, CCL11, CXCL2, CXCL10, CCR7), STAT1, and STAT2, with many of them previously described in sheep (Spencer et al., 2008).",

Except for TRD, these genes are related to immunoglobulins and indicate a possible increase in B-lymphocyte activity or an increase in the endometrial B-lymphocyte population in lactating dairy cows. None of these immunoglobulin genes were affected by pregnancy and no interaction with lactation was observed, indicating a novel effect on endometrial gene expression caused specifically by lactation. Nonetheless, it is not surprising that an event such as lactation could promote an imbalance in the immune system in the peri-implantation period, with potential negative effects on maintenance of the conceptus. Several chemokines and cytokines are responsible for the stimulation of B-lymphocyte plasma cells to produce antibodies; however, conclusions on how lactation affects immunoglobulin production are unclear at this point and require further investigation.",

The \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, unlike the \u03b1\u03b2 T cells, are not major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted and can recognize unprocessed antigens without presentation by MHC molecules; thus, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are likely to interact with the conceptus during pregnancy because \u03b3\u03b4 T cells need the conceptus for activation.

            "text": "The changes in the endometrium transcriptome caused by lactation described above have the potential to affect mechanisms that are often observed in pregnant uteri. Among many immune-related genes affected only by pregnancy, some exemplify the notion that the uterus is searching for an immunologically balanced environment necessary for a successful implantation. For instance, the chemokine signaling pathway (Figure 11) is a classical pathway affected by type 1 IFN (Stark et al., 1998). The chemokine CXCL10, which was upregulated more than 11-fold in pregnant cows in the current study, is described as a promoter of trophoblast growth, migration, and adhesion (Nagaoka et al., 2003), but it also regulates inflammatory and immune responses with a strong chemotactic activity toward T helper 1-lymphocytes, eosinophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells (Taub et al., 1993). In the current study and others (Lobo et al., 2004), many genes of the complement pathway were upregulated by pregnancy (C1QA, C1QB, C1QC, C2, CFB, CFP), a proinflammatory B-lymphocyte stimulated reaction probably needed to provide the developing embryo with some protection within an uterine environment that on d 17 of estrous cycle or pregnancy is driven by the immunosuppressive effects of progesterone. A direct regulator of the complement system is pentraxin-related gene (PTX3), which was highly upregulated by pregnancy in the current study and has the ability to bind C1Q and regulate the classical complement pathway cascade (Nauta et al., 2003; Popovici et al., 2008). The uterine serpins SERPING1 or SERPINA14 were also upregulated in the current study and could serve as immune suppressors against the complement-mediated immune responses. In sheep, SERPINA14 can block lymphocyte proliferation in vitro, natural killer cell activity in vitro and in vivo, and T-cell dependent antibody production in vivo (Padua and Hansen, 2010). Another gene upregulated (64-fold increase) in pregnant cows that could also have an immunomodulatory activity is indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (INDO or IDO). Recently, an 18-fold increase in IDO mRNA was observed in d-18 pregnant heifers, and a decrease in endometrial l-tryptophan and an increase in l-kynurenine were observed from d 12 to 18 in pregnant heifers (Groebner et al., 2011). Results from the current study indicate that the immune system is probably the most affected system in the endometrium when the conceptus is present. A vast number of genes with distinct immune functions (i.e., pro- and antiinflammatory) may serve to create a uterine environment that is sufficiently protected against viral and bacterial infections but still tolerant enough to accept the implantation of the embryo. Lactation is likely to affect this balanced immune environment in the endometrium with potential negative effects on embryo survivability.",

            "text": "The cadherin CDH1 or E-cadherin was affected by pregnancy and, unlike other cadherins, was upregulated in the present study. E-Cadherin is a transmembrane cell surface molecule that is involved in calcium-dependent cell-to-cell adhesion of epithelial cells (Takeichi, 1988). It interacts with \u03b2-catenin, which, in addition to having a role in cell adhesion, functions as an intracellular signaling molecule in the canonical Wnt pathway (Willert and Nusse, 1998). The Wnt signaling pathway is implicated in cell polarity, proliferation, differentiation, and junctional complexes, including CDH1 (Jamora et al., 2003; Karner et al., 2006). In the current study, WNT2, GSK3B, MSX1 were all downregulated (CTNNB1 had a numerical decrease in expression only) by pregnancy, findings similar to those in preimplantation endometrium in sheep (Satterfield et al., 2008). The cascade of the Wnt signaling pathway represented by WNT2, GSK3B, CTNNB1, and MSX1 was in fact downregulated on d 17 of pregnancy, which indicates an important feature of bovine uterine regulation in preparation to accommodate the conceptus. Furthermore, a pregnancy upregulation (almost 4-fold) of dickkopf homolog 1 (DKK1), a secreted inhibitor of Wnt signaling (Glinka et al., 1998), may be the main force contributing to the downregulation of the canonical Wnt pathway. Interestingly, CDH1 was upregulated in pregnancy, indicating that CDH1 is probably under the influence of another signaling pathway and that perhaps other cadherins and claudins, such as CDH2, CDH11, CDH13, and CLDN10, are targets of the Wnt signaling pathway in cattle. In addition to its function in the endometrium, DKK1 of endometrial origin could go to the lumen and affect embryo development because of its function in head and limb development (Grotewold and R\u00fcther, 2002; Nie, 2005; Lieven et al., 2010). The fact that we observed a downregulation of DKK1 by lactation (2-fold downregulated) that counters the positive effect of pregnancy on DKK1 expression indicates a powerful candidate gene mediating the effects of lactation on endometrium transcriptome. Improper amounts of DKK1 to block the Wnt pathway in the uterus and in the conceptus at specific times (such as on d 17 of gestation) could lead to suboptimal embryo development and partly explain the large embryonic losses observed in lactating dairy cows. Another gene regulated by pregnancy and lactation and their interaction was reelin (RELN); it was downregulated in lactating pregnant cows compared with lactating cyclic cows, but was not altered by pregnancy status in nonlactating cows. The RELN gene encodes a secretory serine protease (a glycoprotein) that guides neurons and radial glial cells to their correct positions during brain development in the embryo (Fatemi, 2005). Lactating pregnant cows had a decrease in RELN expression to about half of what was observed in lactating cyclic cows, demonstrating a possible imbalance and perhaps lower availability of this protein with potential effects on embryo differentiation and development. It is interesting to note that DKK1 and RELN can both utilize the same receptor family (lipoprotein receptors, LPR), and both have implications in brain formation during embryo development.",

The downregulation of cadherins, claudins, and collagens indicates a strong remodeling of the endometrium tissue, perhaps to accommodate the changes necessary for embryo development, such as vascularization, uterine gland remodeling, cell proliferation, migration, and even the permeability of the epithelium (Tsukita and Furuse, 2002). Satterfield et al. (2008), when studying the effect of pregnancy and progesterone on the Wnt signaling pathway, observed downregulation of genes related to tight junctions in the preimplantation period of the ovine uterus. Those authors suggest that the loss of epithelial tight junctions before elongation may be to increase the availability of serum- or stromal-derived molecules within the uterine lumen that stimulate embryo growth and elongation (Satterfield et al., 2008).",

Angiopoietin-like 2 (ANGPTL2), known to regulate endothelial cell growth (Morisada et al., 2006), was downregulated by pregnancy in the current study and previously described as a possible regulator of angiogenesis during the estrous cycle (Mitko et al., 2008). Most reports indicate a vasculature development during pregnancy and toward estrus during the estrous cycle (Greiss and Anderson, 1969; Mitko et al., 2008). However, little information is known about the vasculature remodeling on d 17 of gestation in the bovine. Lactation, for instance, downregulated placental growth factor (PlGF or PGF), which is positively involved in angiogenesis and partly regulated by VEGF via MAPK signaling pathway in humans (Zhao et al., 2004). Angiogenesis is probably a dynamic process as gestation progresses, but the results from this study indicate that, near implantation, both pregnancy and lactation seem to downregulate this process. Whether the downregulation of PlGF by lactation has an additive negative effect on vascularization and negatively affects uterine function and embryo development remains unclear.",

Mitko et al. (2008) found an overrepresentation of genes involved in nutritional support of the embryo during diestrus, including several transporters such as SLC1A1 (glutamate), SLC11A2 (metal ion), and SLC16A1 (monocarboxylate), indicating that transporter molecules are actively upregulated as the estrous cycle progresses, possibly adjusting to metabolic needs of the elongating embryo. Results also indicate that not only are transporters of substrates more available on d 17 of pregnancy in endometrial cells but they are all upregulated in association with a large number of genes related to glycolysis such as LOC614107 (similar to hexokinase II), hexokinase 4 (GCK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (PCK2), phosphofructokinase (PFK), and phosphoglucomutase 5 (PGM5). Interestingly, the only gene linked to glycolysis and affected (upregulated) by lactation was pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK4), which was not affected by pregnancy. It is involved in the reduction of glucose utilization by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase, thus reducing the conversion of pyruvate as an energy source through the citric acid cycle (Sugden and Holness, 2006). Lactation also decreased a carbohydrate transporter (SLC35A4) and another transporter related to zinc (SLC39A13), which could partially impair the utilization of glucose by the endometrium and negatively affect pregnancy.",

Several genes (FCGRT, IGHG1, IGLL, andTRD) were upregulated by lactation but not altered by pregnancy. These genes indicate a possible increase in B-lymphocyte and \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell activity that could negatively affect the fine immunological balance of the uterus necessary to accept the semi-allograph embryo. In addition, lactation affected DKK1 and RELN, 2 genes involved with embryonic neural and limb development, by countering the effects of pregnancy on these genes. The Wnt signaling pathway was downregulated by pregnancy, and the increase in DKK1 by lactation may prove an important process that regulates embryonic loss in lactating dairy cows. The regulation of different immune functions seems to be the most important event in the d 17 pregnant endometrium as observed by the several genes and GO terms related to the immune system, and the current study suggests that lactation disturbs some of these mechanisms. Cell adhesion (represented by cadherins, claudins, collagens, and L-galectins) was a function mostly downregulated by pregnancy at this stage, which may indicate a strong tissue remodeling as well as a window of time that facilitates the flow of substrates to the uterine lumen to support the elongating embryo. The implication that lactation acts on the Wnt signaling pathway also indicates an interference of lactation on remodeling of the endometrium. In addition, the effect of lactation on RELN reinforces the potential impact of lactational status on embryonic differentiation and development. Because of the activity in endometrial tissue on d 17 of gestation, genes related to carbohydrate, lipid, and AA metabolism and transport are upregulated by pregnancy, but upregulation of PDK4 by lactation indicates that lactation exerted a negative effect on glucose homeostasis.",
