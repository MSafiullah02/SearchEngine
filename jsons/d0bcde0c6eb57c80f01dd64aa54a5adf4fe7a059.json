The side chains were placed by using SCWRL 3.0 (Canutescu et al., 2003) and manually adjusted in Swiss-PdbViewer (Guex and Peitsch, 1997). Missing intermolecular and intramolecular salt bridges, namely R845-E850, K866-E871 and E868-R872 respectively, were introduced and torsion angles of the core side chains were adjusted to the usual values in coiled-coil structures. Finally, the model was optimized by performing 100 rounds of steepest-descent energy minimization as implemented in Swiss-PdbViewer and coiled-coil parameters were validated using TWISTER (Strelkov and Burkhard, 2002) .",

Rat kidney lysate serves as positive control. Protein extracts were separated on 7.5 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to 0.45 \u00b5m nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with N-PC2 (1:2000) in blocking buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C with rocking. The membranes were further incubated with a secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated, Biorad; 1:2000) for 1 hr at RT.

Supplemental Figure 4 Specific localisation of polycystin-2 in whorls and karmellae A-D, High resolution images of whorls (A, C, D) and karmellae (B) in PC2-expressing HEK 293T cells. Electron micrographs show sections through a whorl (W) and karmellae (K)containing cell. In panel B, karmellae appears to be lamellar ER membrane adjacent to the outer nuclear envelope. In panel C, clusters of whorls appear to be peeling away from the juxtanuclear cisternae. A zoom of lamellar ER is shown in panel D. The organization of whorls as pairs of membranes is clearly apparent. Arrows indicate pairs of apposed ER membranes separated by cytoplasmic space. N, nucleus; C, cytosol; L, lumen.

B, 2D NMR studies investigating the interaction between 15 N-CT2 or 15 N-CT2-4M with unlabeled MBP-CT1. Addition of one equivalent of unlabeled CT1 produced large changes to the NMR spectrum of labeled CT2 but had little effect on labeled CT2-4M. Unlabeled MBP-CT1-R4227X had little effect on the NMR spectrum of labeled CT2 or CT2-4M. The two proteins were approximately 20 \u00b5M, implying that the dissociation constant for the CT2/CT1 interaction must be in the low \u00b5M range or stronger.
