IFNs are molecules secreted in response to pathogens, and their production results in an inflammatory state. As such, patients with type 1 interferonopathies who are affected by the upregulation of type I IFN signaling have persistent systemic inflammation. There is a growing body of evidence implicating IFN pathways in the pathogenesis of APOL1-associated collapsing glomerulopathy. Collapsing glomerulopathy is the most fulminant histopathologic form of APOL1-associated nephropathy. This form of glomerulopathy is well known to be associated with diseases that have increased IFN levels, such as HIV infection and systemic lupus erythematosus.4\n,\n5\n,\n9\n,\n15\n",
