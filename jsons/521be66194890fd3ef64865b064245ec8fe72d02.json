In the USA, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) predictions are used to evaluate two to three thousand chemicals each year and to assess a significant portion of the toxicity information [3] . Due to the uncertainty in the predictions, their use is extremely limited. While the EU and other countries have been very passive in introducing QSARs, they are now actively investing in the development and expansion of QSARs programs with the introduction of the REACH system that declares 'No Data, No Market' for all chemicals. In addition, institutional support has been established to require that non-testing methods, such as QSARs, be identified first, before conducting a new toxicity test for REACH registration [2] . In Korea, the enactment of the Law on the Registration and Evaluation of Chemical Substances (the K-REACH Act, enacted in 2015) has strengthened the EU's obligation to evaluate not only new chemicals, but also existing chemicals that are manufactured or imported of over 1 ton quantity [4] . In order to improve the evaluation of chemicals to the level of developed countries, this law was introduced to strengthen the responsibility for demonstrating the hazards and risks of industries. As a result of this institutional strengthening, the enacted law also allows the submission of data by non-testing methods, such as QSARs as defined in EU REACH. In addition, the K-REACH Act stipulates omission of the toxicity test data for small quantities (less than 1 tonne per year) of new chemicals with a small amount of manufacture or import, which means that it must be absolutely dependent on the results of QSARs for the evaluation of small quantities of new scientific substances [4] . In this respect, many efforts have been made to collect, interpret, and link large amounts of known chemicals to each other, and to link chemicals to evaluations.",

This review examines several applications of in silico toxicological approaches that many industries and institutions are taking, reviewing the examples of in silico tools they are using for their predictions. When the in silico toxicology (IST) protocol is fully developed and implemented, the IST assessment will be able to be used to evaluate the chemicals in the workplace and the regulatory body. The development of the IST protocol is an initiative developed in collaboration between international consortia and reflects the latest in silico toxicology for risk identification and characterization. In this review, a new approach to determine the credibility of in silico predictions with raw data is explored, and the method of determining the confidence level of evaluation based on the credibility of data is discussed.",

Here is a brief review of the issues involved in using predictive toxicology in regulatory alternative analysis (AA). It is good practice to use case studies to integrate predictive toxicology with AA, to start with prioritization of chemicals of interest, and to leverage existing resources to integrate predictive toxicology into AA practices using existing resources. Incorporating predictive toxicity into AA will enhance the ability of workplaces and regulators to choose alternatives to hazardous components and further increase the use of toxicity prediction in regulation [5] . Computational toxicology, also known as \"in silico toxicology,\" is based on knowledge gained from various scientific disciplines, and its activity is known due to the premise that the toxicity of chemicals is predictable in the molecular structure, and can be inferred from the properties. In order to provide a faster, more economic, and animalfree tool for predicting the toxicity of analogous compounds, structure-activity relationships (SARs) play an important role as the application of chemical genotoxicity and carcinogenicity assessments increases. The development of SAR algorithms is an ongoing process, and new models, as well as new versions of applications, are constantly being made available [6] .",

It is considered to be one of the alternatives to animal testing, which, in broad terms, utilizes a variety of computational techniques that correlate the toxicity or efficacy of a chemical with its structure. Computational techniques make it possible to quantitatively and qualitatively predict the toxicity of chemicals, mixtures, nanomaterials, and so on. The methods have strengths and limitations, specifics of scope and interpretation, so it is important to find the most effective method for each problem. Chemicals are toxic by interacting with other substances, and risk assessments can overlook the side effects of the mixture. For example, although adding other metals together increases lead (Pb) toxicity and reports accumulative risk assessment, there is a lack of raw data on the toxicity of the mixture, due to chemical exposure types and complex interactions, and it is not possible to test all combinations of these elements [10] .",

A linear QSNR model has been provided to predict EC 50 (effective concentration for 50% enzymatic inhibition) for silver nanoparticles from size and surface charge, and a QSNR model using a quantum chemical descriptor is a fullerene C 60 derivative. Integrating high-throughput screening methods with biosafety and in silico modeling emphasizes a system biology approach that ensures quality in nanosafety research, bridges the mechanical gap in fundamental research, and makes recommendations for predictive biological responses in nanotoxicology. In particular, \"nano-QSAR\" should be systematic and standardized as information collected in consideration of nano-characteristics. When developing toxicity prediction models, system interactions should be considered, and the EU NanoPUZZLES project was one of the global collaborations that improved the data availability and modeling approach to support the evaluation of nanomaterials [25] . Strategic development that combines multiple alternative tests can be useful for NM risk assessment and can assist decision-making [26] .",

To ensure the credibility of the forecast results, the OECD Toolbox report is prepared by applying five principles to ensure the credibility of the forecast program presented by the OECD. It is expected that this will be useful for collecting hazard and risk information of chemicals, and preparing new safety data sheets for not only researchers, but also companies that manufacture or import chemicals.

The genotoxic impurities play a critical role in carcinogenesis, and impurities that affect pharmaceutical, safety, efficacy, and drug quality are attracting increasing interest in regulatory agencies and related industries [37] . Toxicity is defined as a series of events resulting from exposure to, and the distribution and metabolism of chemicals, and ultimately, interactions with other macromolecules in the cell, that is, interactions with DNA or proteins with various toxicity endpoints [38] . Mutagenicity is a major toxic endpoint for chemical risk assessment. The nature of a chemical that alters DNA or RNA sequences is mutagenicity, and these mutations can actually be fixed or transmitted [39] . DNA can be affected by ultraviolet light and by a variety of chemicals, such as industrial chemicals, pesticides, and the combustion byproducts of fossil fuels [40] . The accurate identification of potentially toxic chemicals represents an important problem, and chemicals are proven to be mutagens mainly through battery experiments such as in vitro and in vivo. The electrophilic theory of Miller and Miller's chemical carcinogens suggests that most of the carcinogens are electrophilic or nucleic acids or proteins [41] . Further reacting with nucleophilic groups leads to the fact that electrophilic properties are common between mutations and carcinogens [42] . There are various in silico approaches for identifying and predicting chemically induced mutagens [43] . Although the in vivo genotoxicity of a compound does not always correlate with its activity in an in vitro test system, there may be good overlap between two endpoints for certain compounds. However, the difficulty lies in selecting the most appropriate protocol to establish an example of this relationship and to highlight potential in vivo risks. With this in mind, a project has begun to assess the relevance of existing structural alerts for ex vivo chromosomal damage from expert system Derek Nexus to its in vivo activity, by assessing the predictability of in vivo chromosomal damage datasets. Detailed information related to the in vivo activities and protocols added to the alert along with the mechanism information provided is useful for directing further testing of the compound of interest [44] . Various software is currently available for mutagenesis prediction and mutagenesis analysis.

This highlights the need for a reliable eye stimulation model that takes into account the mechanism of action and the individual structural classification, and the value of the profiling compound in relation to its chemical reactivity and physicochemical properties, which, together with the existing model, provide better prediction of severe stimulants [46] . Potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals present difficult regulatory challenges, and endocrinedisrupting chemicals can interfere with hormonal receptors associated with various health hazards. By integrating QSAR, docking, and systems biology approaches as virtual screening tools for use in risk assessment, systems biology pathways and network analysis approaches will provide a means to more critically assess the potential impact of endocrine-disrupting chemicals [47] . QSARs can contribute to the assessment of chemicals under REACH, where appropriate, and in some cases can be applied instead of experimental tests to fill in data gaps for information requirements. These results are similar to those of early QSAR and experimental studies of chemicals and show how high-throughput virtual screening can be used to identify potential genotoxic carcinogens, mutagens, and developmental toxins using QSAR predictions [48] . The US EPA Endocrine Disorder Screening Program (EDSP) uses in vitro data sourced from ToxCast/Tox21 high-throughput screening assays to evaluate the endocrine activity of chemicals. The QSAR model estimated more potent estrogen activity for most of the known estrogen metabolites compared to the parent chemical, and the method proposed in the in silico approach is an inexpensive and fast strategy for the detection of chemicals using estrogen metabolites [45] . A rapid test strategy for reproductive toxicity testing, avoiding the use of animals, combines knowledge of important processes affected by reproductive toxicants with the knowledge of the mechanical basis of those effects. As an additional step, examples were generated of how to predict the reproductive toxicity of chemicals using available data, formal validation of panel components was performed, and mechanical approaches used to test and verify, using more innovative approaches [49] .",

This review undertook a comprehensive overview of the properties of in silico models tools for prediction, and the characteristics of the computational tools, and examined the future prospects. The various methods have their different strengths and weaknesses with varied scope of application, and each goal needs to find the most effective method among them. QSNRs (also known as nano QSARs) that use nanomaterial-specific descriptors are related to their structural and physicochemical properties. A linear QSNR model was used to predict the effective concentration for EC 50 enzymatic inhibition of silver nanoparticles using size and surface charge. The toxicity of a chemical is related to its interaction with other chemicals. For example, it has been found that the toxicity of lead (Pb) increases with the coadministration of other metals, and a \"cumulative risk assessment\" has been developed to evaluate the toxicity of mixtures. But due to chemical exposure types and complex interactions, insufficient experimental data on the toxicity of mixtures are available, and it is not possible to test all combinations of these elements [50] .",

These methods and models are areas where further development is expected for future chemical safety assessments. Recently, in vitro and in vivo tests have been performed to evaluate chemical safety and a variety of toxic side effects [11] , to develop in vitro models, such as \"in vivo organs.\" Although efforts are being made, the process is still costly and time-consuming. Comparing the experimental methods, computational techniques show lots of advantages, because of their natural, fast, cheap, and accurate performances before the compound of interest is synthesized [12] . Many software and Web servers can be used to predict chemical toxicity, and OECD Toolbox is a product for predicting and modeling toxicity using QSTR. The Web server is easy to use and favors toxicologists. Lazar can predict many toxic endpoints using a user interface to describe the chemical structure [51] .

Sourced and modified from Refs. [23, 32] . Adapted with permission silico toxicity predictions continue to evolve through the introduction of new methods, and improvements to current methods. The future of chemical hazard assessment emphasizes the replacement of animal experiments with human-related assays in vitro or in silico, and intelligently combining and using information for toxicity assessment and decision-making through an increasing variety of alternative assays. Certainly, useful components in the process of evaluating in silico toxicology, and in the future, mathematical calculations, will be extended to include special new types of toxicology items and models for chemicals. Toxicity evaluation of chemicals is essential for workers' health and safety. Regulations for assessing the toxicity of genotoxic impurities lead to the integration of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity in vivo, and in vitro assays are becoming integrated with computational predictions [52] . One of the ICH M7 guidelines focuses on the identification of mutagens using in silico prediction, instead of in vitro studies [53] . Good prediction depends on two main factors: sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is the ability of a program to accurately identify true positive mutagens, which are chemicals that are likely to cause mutations, and specificity is the ability to identify true negative mutagens, such as safe chemicals that are not likely to be mutagenic [54] . In silico screening techniques can be applied to the toxicity assessment of chemicals, and the number of chemicals can be filtered by evaluating large libraries of compounds. Virtual screening is a cheminformatics tool applied using two categories of ligand-based and structure-based screening. The approach of virtual screening also utilizes target and ligand information to predict ADMET properties and other molecular characterization data [55] .",

These data-driven models can be used to accelerate the decision-making process by screening hazards, and making early identification and management of potential toxicity, and physicochemical properties; and maximizing the use of information that these models provide can also support the industrial, regulatory, and public needs for safer chemicals [64] .

Cheminformatics provides a computer method for learning from chemistry data and for the modeling tasks facing chemists.
