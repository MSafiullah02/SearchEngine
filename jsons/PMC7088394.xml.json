For example, in Southeast Asia, Pteropus fruit bats are the natural reservoirs of the zoonotic paramyxoviruses Hendra and Nipah (Chua et al. 2000). In 2002\u20132003, an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in China (Drosten et al. 2003, Ksiazek et al. 2003), and bats were determined to be natural reservoirs and the possible source of the virus (Ge et al. 2013; Lau et al. 2010). In 2012, a pathogenic paramyxovirus, Sosuga virus, which caused severe illness in a patient following contact with bats in Uganda, was subsequently detected in Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) (Amman et al. 2015). In Africa, Egyptian fruit bats (R. aegyptiacus) are reservoirs of Marburg virus (Towner et al. 2008), and antibodies against Zaire ebola virus have been detected in the same species (Pourrut et al. 2009), while antibodies against Bombali ebolavirus have been detected in Little free-tailed bat (Chaerephon pumilus), Angolan free-tailed bat (Mops condylurus) (Goldstein et al. 2018).",

Date, site name, season, apparent species, sex, age class (determined by the degree of epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion) (Anthony 1988), reproductive status, and mass data were recorded. For handling and restraining larger fruit bats, light anesthesia was induced using inhalational isoflurane and oxygen (Fluriso\u2122, Teva UK, Limited, Castleford, UK). Smaller fruit bats and insectivorous bats were physically restrained during sampling. All bats were released at the capture site within 3 h of capture.",

Purified PCR products were cloned (pCR4-TOPO vector; Invitrogen Corp.) and sequenced (ABI 3730 Capillary Electrophoresis Genetic Analyzer; Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Sequences were analyzed and edited using Geneious (Version 6.0.3) and compared with known sequences in the Genbank database. Species identification of PCR-positive individuals was confirmed by DNA bar coding of the cytochrome b (Cytb) and cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) mitochondrial genes (Townzen et al. 2008). Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to examine the association of viral positivity with age and season using STATA 13.0 software.

The high sequence similarity of the viral fragment detected in both bat species suggests that this virus may have the ability to be maintained in more than one host or that cross-species transmission may occur. Studies have found that viral sharing and cross-species transmission may be important factors that contribute to emergence of novel coronaviruses and recombination of bat coronaviruses (Lau et al. 2010; Johnson et al. 2015).",
