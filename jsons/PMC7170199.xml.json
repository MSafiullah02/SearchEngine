About half of the patients will have nystagmus. A staggering gait, dysarthria, and truncal ataxia are the characteristic features.2 Peripheral white blood cell counts are expected to be normal. Cerebrospinal fluid studies typically yield a mild pleocytosis with normal protein. A computed tomographic scan of the head will typically be normal. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging of the head typically shows abnormal signal intensity in the cerebellum, cerebral white matter, or globus pallidus.3 The pathophysiology of postinfectious acute cerebellar ataxia is poorly understood. The offending agent may produce the ataxia via direct invasion of the cerebellar tissues or via an autoimmune-mediated effect.4 Cerebral and cerebellar antibodies have been found after varicella infections.5 Parvovirus B19 has been associated with cerebellar vascular injuries.6 Single-photon emission computed tomography of the head may demonstrate reduced regional cerebellar blood flow.7\n",

This condition is typically considered a self-limited, monophasic disorder that is thought to be immune mediated9 (Table 46-1\n). The incidence of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is estimated to be as high as 5 in 10,000 hospital admissions. The association with an antecedent viral infection is reported to be between 54% and 77%. However, the true cause-and-effect relationship has not been definitively established due to the high background frequency of viral illnesses in children.8, 10, 11, 12 The average age of onset is 8 years, with a reported age range of 3 months to 18 years of age. A common reported prodrome is headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, and malaise. There are no clinical, laboratory, or computed tomographic findings pathognomonic for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. The diagnosis is made based on the neurologic examination and the presence of large, multifocal, hyperdense areas in the brain and spinal cord on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Electroencephalograms typically reveal nonspecific findings and are not diagnostic. Cerebrospinal fluid findings are also nondiagnostic and may reveal mild pleocytosis.",

Because the causes of dystonia are varied, there is not a single overall approach that is appropriate to these children. The evaluation and management is typically guided by the likely cause based on the history and physical examination. Although clinical experience suggests acute dystonia is relatively rare in children, one of the more common causes is exposure to medications. Commonly implicated medications include dextromethorphan, cisapride, and metoclopramide. Treatment for medication-induced acute dystonia is often accomplished by administering 1.25 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) of intravenous or intramuscular diphenhydramine. Unless there are other extenuating circumstances, children who respond well to the diphenhydramine can usually be discharged home from the emergency department after a short period of observation. Continuing oral diphenhydramine at home for a few days is probably prudent. Coordinating the discontinuance of the inciting medication with the prescribing physician is a reasonable courtesy in many cases.",

The term juvenile Huntington's disease is sometimes used to designate these early-onset cases. While adults will often have uncontrolled choreic movements, children are much more likely to manifest rigid akinetic symptoms.15 The initial presentation of juvenile Huntington's disease is often very subtle and nonspecific, making early diagnosis difficult. Common early symptoms include personality changes, school performance problems, rigidity, slowness, stiffness, an awkward gait, clumsiness, speech difficulties, drooling, frequent choking episodes, and seizures.16, 17, 18, 19\n",

Tourette's syndrome is characterized by repetitive, stereotypical tics that are intermittent and have a compulsive quality to them. The range of symptoms can be divided between vocal, motor, and behavioral. Boys tend to manifest motor and vocal symptoms, while girls tend to manifest more behavioral symptoms. The most well-known and dramatic of the vocal manifestations is coprolalia, the expression of \u201cdirty\u201d words or phrases. Most patients do not demonstrate this feature. Between 5% and 30% of patients with Tourette's syndrome manifest coprolalia. The vocal tics range from simple sounds to complex phrases or speech patterns such as echolalia (repetition of words) or palilalia (rapid repetition of words or phrases). The motor manifestations may be simple, fast, meaningless muscle movements or they may be slower, stereotyped movements that look purposeful. The behavioral symptoms include those labeled attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, self-mutilation, aggression, and various learning disabilities.30, 31, 32, 33\n",
