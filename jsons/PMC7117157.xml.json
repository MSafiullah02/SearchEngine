International studies estimate that approximately 80% of all purebred cats are infected with the causative agent, feline coronavirus (FCoV). Out of these, 5\u201312% develop the classical symptoms of effusive/wet FIP, the non-effusive/dry form of FIP or a combination of both. The outcome of clinical FIP is almost always fatal (de Groot and Horzinek, 1995).",

            "text": "The pathogenesis of the disease is complex with many unresolved issues relating to the role of the immune system. Humoral immunity is not protective and conventional vaccines seem to accelerate the disease progress rather than being protective (Vemmema et al., 1990). This has been attributed to antibodies that facilitate the uptake of virus into macrophages (Hayashi et al., 1983, Pedersen, 1995, Olsen et al., 1992, Olsen et al., 1993, Hohdatsu et al., 1994). The histopathological lesions in the wet form of FIP (mainly vasculitis) are suggestive of a type III hypersensitivity reaction. On the other hand, the histopathological picture in the dry form of FIP (mainly granuloma formations) point in the direction of a type IV immune reaction. Based on these and other observations it has been hypothesized that animals with a weak cell-mediated immunity (CMI) in combination with a strong humoral immune response are likely to develop wet FIP. In contrast, cats with a moderately strong CMI would develop the dry form of the disease. Finally, cats with a strong CMI may not develop the disease at all (Pedersen, 1995). The viral influence on the type of immune response mounted against the viral infection is not known, but is assumed to be acquired, via mutation from the harmless feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) into the lethal feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (Vennema et al., 1998).",

In addition, the expression of IFN-\u03b3 within the inflammatory lesions was examined by RT-PCR. Our results confirm the mixed nature of the inflammatory reaction in FIP, involving B cells and plasma cells as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

These antibodies had previously been tested on feline lymphoid tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, verifying their reactivity and specificity (Lundgren et al., 1995, Berg et al., 1999). To identify macrophages, a biotinylated Griffonia Simplicifolia lectin (Vector Laboratories) was used. The monoclonal antibodies were applied overnight, after blocking steps with avidin, biotin and normal horse serum. On day 2, a biotinylated horse anti-mouse antibody (Vector Laboratories) was applied to the sections for 30 min at a dilution of 1:200. Following quenching of endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H2O2 for 15 min, an avidin\u2013biotin complex (ABC) (Vector Laboratories) was added to the sections for 30 min. Bound antibodies were visualized with AEC. Washing with TRIS-buffered saline (TBS) was performed between every incubation step. The biotinylated lectin was applied to paraffin sections for 60 min at room temperature. Blocking of unspecific background staining, washing steps and visualization followed essentially the protocol used for frozen tissue sections. After the completion of immunohistochemistry, all sections were counterstained with haematoxylin.",

Here, our results differ somewhat from Kipar et al. (1998), who reported that T cells only occurred in low numbers in all types of lesions. This discrepancy in results might be due to different specificities of the antibodies used for immunohistochemistry: non-cat specific (Kipar et al.) versus cat specific. CD4+ cells tended to be more numerous than CD8+ cells in type B lesions, providing some support for the notion of a type IV hypersensitivity reaction in the pathogenesis of FIP (Paltrinieri et al., 1998b). The same predominance of CD4+ cells over CD8+ cells in FIP granulomas was reported by Paltrinieri et al. (1998a), who used a different panel of monoclonal antibodies. A further indication of a type IV hypersensitivity reaction is the presence of multinucleated giant cells in type B lesions. This cell type, not commonly reported as a feature of FIP, usually occurs during conditions of chronic stimulation of macrophages (e.g. tuberculosis) (Tizard, 1987).",

However, those results were obtained using peripheral blood mononuclear cells only. It seems likely that cytokine profiles run on samples from tissues with relevant inflammatory lesions would reflect the local cytokine response more adequately. In a recent study, Dean et al. (2003) found a non-significant tendency of elevated IFN-\u03b3 mRNA expression in lymphoid tissues in FIP-infected cats as compared to controls. Also, in a study focused on the neurological form of FIP, Foley et al. (2003) showed that cats with generalized FIP (but not cats with purely neurological affection) had upregulation of IFN-\u03b3 as well as several other Th1-associated cytokines in the brain.

Macrophages are, without question, the most predominant inflammatory cells in FIP lesions. Cytokines secreted by local T cells will attract more macrophages to the lesions, thereby stimulating and preserving the granulomatous inflammation. Of particular interest in this context is the role of IFN-\u03b3. A strong local IFN-\u03b3 expression would be expected to result in activation of macrophages, including an increase in the number of Fc-receptors on the macrophage cell membrane. Thus, viral uptake in macrophages is enhanced and viral replication increased. On the other hand, a strong IFN-\u03b3 response is considered to be vital in the defense against viral agents, stimulating the differentiation of cytotoxic T cells.",

In addition, many molecules are redundant, having many different effects and acting on different cells.
