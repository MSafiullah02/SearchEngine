This approach has been addressed by Pappalardo and colleagues who developed the ECMOnet score concerning risk stratification in H1N1 pneumonia [7] and Lindskov and colleagues who developed a score concerning ICU survival [8]. Recently, the question of 6-month outcome prediction and risk stratification of ARDS patients treated by ECMO was addressed by Schmidt and colleagues, who developed the Predicting Death for Severe ARDS on VV-ECMO (PRESERVE) score [9]. This mortality risk score was developed with eight pre-ECMO parameters; that is, age, body mass index, immunocompromised status, prone position, days of mechanical ventilation, sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and plateau pressure. Recently, the same group developed the Respiratory Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation Survival Prediction (RESP) score addressing the question of survival prediction after ECMO for severe acute respiratory failure [10]. Twelve pre-ECMO parameter were incorporated in this more complex score, where the acute respiratory diagnosis, central nervous dysfunction, acute associated non-pulmonary infection, neuromuscular blockade agents, use of NO, bicarbonate infusion, cardiac arrest, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and peak inspiratory pressure are used in addition to age, immunocompromised status and days of mechanical ventilation.",

            "text": "Validating the PRESERVE and RESP scores in the setting of our study confirms their usefulness in discriminating survival probability for ARDS patients treated on ECMO in a tertiary hospital (Figure 1), and particularly in the subgroup of patients treated on v-v ECMO. Because of the small number of patients treated on v-a ECMO no final conclusion can be drawn from the findings in our study. In the subgroup of patients treated on v-v ECMO we found an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.92) using the PRESERVE score and an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.95) with the RESP score, compared to 0.89 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.94) in the PRESERVE study [9] and 0.74 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.76) in the RESP study [10]. The lower AUC of the PRESERVE score in our study suggests a weaker but significant performance for the PRESERVE score if applied externally, which is not the case for the RESP score. While there is good agreement of mortality risk estimation in PRESERVE score groups 2 and 3, the overall survival in group 1 in our study was lower than in the French study (78% versus 97%). In contrast, mortality risk estimation obtained using the RESP score is much closer to what we observed. This difference between PRESERVE mortality risk estimation and observed mortality may be explained by the high mortality in the subgroup of patients treated with v-a ECMO (60%) in our study, again suggesting that, compared to v-v cannulation, v-a cannulation is an unfavorable prognostic factor. The slightly higher Charlson\u2019s comorbidity index in our patients may also contribute to the higher mortality. While the PRESERVE score is validated for use in ARDS patients through our findings, it showed suboptimal performance in a heterogeneous collective of patients treated on v-v ECMO for acute respiratory failure [17].",

In contrast, mechanical ventilation prior to ECMO treatment for more than 5 to 7 days, a non-pulmonary cause of ARDS, chronic lung disease, high PaCO2 (\u226575 mmHg) and an elevated peak inspiratory pressure (>35 cmH2O) are independent predictors for poor ECMO treatment outcome characterizing the state of lung disease.
