However, it has also been established that the viral load in children is significantly higher than in adults, and our results are comparable to other studies in children that used swabs. Khamis et al. reported a PR of 50% in nasopharyngeal aspirates from the paediatric patients of an Omani hospital using multiplex PCR. In this study, the most prevalent virus was RSV, but the study population was limited to children under 5 years old 9. Another large, prospective study following paediatric patients for 2 years and employing real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR also detected RSV most frequently, but again patients were young (<2 years) with suspected pneumonia 10. In our study, picornaviruses were most frequently detected in the paediatric population.

Other studies, however, have shown even higher rates of co\u2010infections. In the study by Khamis et al. 9, MVI were found in 18% of cases. Zhang et al. 11 reported a rate of 29.5% in children younger than 3 years old, while Kouni et al. 12 reported an MVI rate of 42.5% in children between 1 month and 14 years old, as detected by DNA/RNA microarray assay. Although the clinical impact of multiple infections is unknown, a more severe clinical course was observed in the latter study 12. It is also unclear whether infection with the first virus may facilitate or prevent infection with other viruses. In the present study, picornaviruses were those most frequently involved in co\u2010infections, which is certainly related to the fact that picornaviruses are detected throughout the year and are the most prevalent. It is also possible, however, that picornavirus serotypes vary over the year; some of these might manifest a seasonal pattern, variable virulence and/or the capacity to predispose their host to additional viral infections. The most frequent co\u2010infection was with picornaviruses and adenoviruses. Not surprisingly, this association was consistent throughout the year, whereas the MVI involving influenza virus, RSV or coronaviruses were more frequently found in winter.",

Hence, an infection following a previous one with still\u2010detectable nucleic acid cannot be excluded. Alternatively, detection of multiple respiratory viruses might be a surrogate marker of immunosuppression, as persistent infection has been described for several respiratory viruses in immunocompromised patients 13. Finally, it seems that co\u2010detection of different respiratory viruses is not random. A recently published study showed that there were positive and negative associations between some viruses. For example, rhinoviruses and adenoviruses were positively associated whereas influenza A virus and rhinoviruses showed a negative association 14. Of note, in our study influenza virus was almost completely absent among the viruses involved in co\u2010infections in the paediatric population, in which picornaviruses were very prevalent.",

Existing evidence suggests that the seasonality of some pathogens may be driven by enhanced wintertime survival, and also by increased host susceptibility resulting from relative \u2018wintertime immune suppression\u2019 15. A cold environment decreases innate defence mechanisms such as mucociliary clearance, so increasing susceptibility to viral infections 16. In a large Malaysian study performed over 27 years and with >10 000 respiratory samples, while RSV and other, less frequent viruses produced peaks throughout the year, they spiked more notably from September to December, correlating with the rainy season 17. For those viruses showing seasonal patterns, the months in which the peaks occur may be determined by local topography and latitude, making comparisons among studies performed in different countries difficult 18.",

The reasons why picornaviruses and adenoviruses display no discernible seasonal patterns are poorly understood. As expected, we found that influenza viruses and other viruses increase in prevalence with a seasonal distribution in winter (see Fig. 3b). In these periods, picornaviruses and adenoviruses were less frequently detected. Whether picornaviruses delay influenza circulation or whether the initiation of influenza circulation decreases the prevalence of picornaviruses is not clear either. It has been suggested that rhinovirus infection might protect against influenza virus infection either through viral interference at the cellular level or via interferon or other cytokines. Indeed, it has been hypothesized that in some countries such as France and Norway, rhinovirus circulation delayed the spread of pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009 19, 20.

The approach should probably be adapted to the local epidemiology of each particular centre. In Geneva, a city with a continental climate and inhabitants who travel internationally with relative frequency, employing a complete panel year\u2010round appears justified, despite a low detection of some viruses. However, as shown in Fig. 3a, despite a slight decrease of PR in summer months, overall PR for respiratory viruses remained relatively stable throughout the year. A complete respiratory viral panel would also be appropriate for immunocompromised patients, particularly lung transplant recipients or children with chronic pulmonary diseases. The additional costs incurred by the use of a complete panel would likely be offset by the attendant reduction in unnecessary hospitalizations and antibiotic therapy.",

A positive result from an upper respiratory sample (e.g. nasopharyngeal aspirate) may represent an upper respiratory infection or a lower one (bronchiolitis for example), hence upper respiratory sampling does not guarantee an upper respiratory infection. Second, pooled data from bacterial and fungal testing were not available; these would have been particularly illuminating among immunocompromised patients. In addition, the prevalence of RSV may be underestimated in our study: because a rapid test for RSV antigen detection is available in our centre in the paediatric emergency wards: not every child with suspected RSV infection was tested by NATs. This may explain, in part, why picornaviruses were detected more frequently in the present study, whereas most other studies report RSV as the most frequent virus in children. Finally, the proportion of immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients is not known; we offer an analysis of the whole population (ambulatory and hospitalized, immunocompetent and immunocompromised).",

Picornaviruses are the most frequently detected respiratory viruses among paediatric, adult and geriatric populations, although influenza virus predominated in the latter. Influenza virus, RSV and human metapneumovirus display a seasonal pattern, whereas picornaviruses and adenoviruses are detected with regularity throughout the year. Multiple infections are commonly observed in children, although their overall prevalence is relatively low. A clearer picture of respiratory virus prevalence patterns across all seasons and age groups aids in the design of diagnostic strategies and can help to reduce unwarranted antimicrobial consumption.",
