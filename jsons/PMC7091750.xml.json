            "text": "Bats represent one-fifth of the world mammal diversity and provide several ecosystem services that benefit diverse sectors of the society (Kasso and Balakrishnan, 2013; Kunz et al., 2011). For example, bats positively affect the economy by acting as insect pest suppressors saving billions of dollars annually on pesticides in agroecosystems (Boyles et al., 2011; Russo et al., 2018), pollinators of commercial plants (e.g. fruit bats are the major pollinators of durian, Durio zibethinus, a highly economic fruit crop in southeast Asia (Bumrungsri et al., 2008), and seed dispersers (maintaining and regenerating forests) (Kasso and Balakrishnan, 2013; Salda\u00f1a-V\u00e1zquez et al., 2019; Taylor et al., 2018). Bats can also be used as bioindicators of environmental pollutants (Heiker et al., 2018; Zukal et al., 2015), a well-known problem of the Chinese large cities. Their role as potential virus hosts of recent outbreaks (e.g. Ebola, Severe acute respiratory syndrome) has also highlighted their public health importance (Han et al., 2015; Moratelli and Calisher, 2015). Particularly in China, bat-borne viruses have drawn the focus of numerous studies in this century (Chu et al., 2008; Cui et al., 2007; Ge et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2009).",

As a result, a massive amount of novelties has been published in the past two decades, making China the current largest producer of scientific papers. Following this trend, post-millennium studies on bats in China have uncovered an overlooked diversity and unveiled several aspects of bats\u2019 evolutionary history and life-history features (Lin et al., 2014; Peng et al., 2017; Tu et al., 2017). Recently, 135 bat species, of which 19% are endemic, were listed in the last national compilation (Jiang et al., 2017). This diversity represents 20% of the Chinese mammal fauna but is expected to be underestimated, as, on average, one new species has been described per year in the last decade and several taxa are known to represent species complexes (Mao et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2016). All this 21st-century knowledge about Chinese bats, however, is scattered in the literature, hampering a general understanding of the current status, and a large part of it is concealed from most of the international scientific community in Mandarin-language articles.",

Mapping the available knowledge is a key step to identify scientific gaps and define priority research topics and subjects to direct research efforts. We hope that our review provides this baseline for future studies. As we anticipated an uneven distribution of publications across taxa and provinces, we test a set of parameters (species distribution range, species threatened status, presence in caves, province area, and province bat diversity) that could be related to research biases. Additionally, we provide an up-to-date list of bat species in China with supporting references.",

Myotis latirostris is allocated in the genus Submyotodon and Myotis ricketti is considered a junior synonym of Myotis pilosus (Ruedi et al., 2015). Myotis taiwanensis is considered subspecies of Myotis fimbriatus following Ruedi et al. (2015). Myotis watasei is considered synonym of M. rufoniger and Myotis flavus is treated as subspecies of M. formosus (Csorba et al., 2014). Previous records of Myotis daubentonii in China refer to Myotix petax (Matveev et al., 2005). Falsistrellus affinis is allocated in the genus Hypsugo (G\u00f6rf\u00f6l and Csorba, 2018). Thainycteris is considered a valid genus (Francis et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2017) and all Chinese records of Kerivoula titania and Kerivoula hardwickii are attributed to K. furva (Yu et al., 2018). All Chinese records of Hipposideros bicolor and Rhinolophus rouxii are respectively attributed to H. pomona and R. sinicus (Zhang et al., 2009a). Hipposideros terasensis is considered subspecies of H. armiger (Thong et al., 2012). The records of Barbastella leucomelas in China were treated either as Barbastella beijingensis or Barbastella darjelingesis depending on the collecting locality (Benda et al., 2008; Kruskop et al., 2019). The few records of Miniopterus fuscus and Miniopterus australis were considered misidentifications as these species have no reliable records in China. The Chinese records of Miniopterus schreibersii were treated as M. fuliginosus or M. magnater based on the collection locality (Li et al., 2015). We consider Plecotus auritus and P. austriacus restricted to Europe (Spitzenberger et al., 2006) and the records of Plecotus from Beijing and Henan provinces are tentatively assigned to P. ognevi.",

Pearson\u00b4s Chi-squared (X\n2) was used to test the evenness distribution of the number of publications per research topic, per species, and per Chinese province. As we anticipated an unbalanced distribution of publications per species, we selected five parameters as explanatory variables to understand why some species are more studied than others using quasi-Poisson generalized linear models in R software (R Development Core, 2017). The parameters are: 1) total species distribution, 2) species distribution in China, 3) IUCN threatened status, 4) Chinese threatened status, and 5) presence in caves. Species distribution was calculated in square kilometers based on IUCN spatial data maps (http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data) using ArcGIS 10.2. The threatened status was based on the most recent assessments of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN, 2017) and the China Mammal Red List (Jiang et al., 2016). Species that were recently described or underwent recent taxonomic changes were not included in this analysis. Presence in caves was retrieved from Luo et al. (2013) and our own survey. Lastly, we assessed via quasi-Poisson generalized models, whether province area (in square kilometer), province bat diversity and the presence of a bat research unit (institute or university) are correlated with the number of publications per province. The number of species per province was calculated by overlapping the IUCN species geographic ranges using ArcGIS 10.2.",

Nearly half of the publications on systematics and taxonomy in the past decades focused on the three most species-rich genera Rhinolophus, Myotis, and Murina. Not surprisingly, 25 species were newly recognized in these genera. In contrast, the majority of genera (82%) was the focus of less than 3% of taxonomic studies (Fig. 3). Particularly for species with wide and disjunct geographic distributions (e.g. Eptesicus serotinus, Nyctalus aviator, Nyctalus noctula, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Plecotus ognevi), we might expect future taxonomic discoveries. An apparent exception to this trend is Hipposideros that was the focus of 9% of the taxonomic studies but showed only minor species-level taxonomic changes in the last decades. Part of this stability can be explained by systematic practices applied by some authors. Marked geographic, morphological, and genetic variation within species of Hipposideros have led to subspecies recognition (Zhao et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2016), largely defined on mitochondrial cytochrome b genetic distance (Bradley and Baker, 2001). However, the degree of genetic divergence should be used as complementary support to set taxonomic ranks, not as sole criteria (Bradley and Baker, 2001; Ferguson, 2002). For future works, we encourage authors to apply multiple lines of evidence in defining species boundaries.",

Less than 4% of all publications in the past 18 years were conducted in the western and northern portions of China, which cover nearly half of the Chinese territory. Our models show that most of the bat studies were held in provinces with higher bat diversity (see Supplementary Data SD6). The core area of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, at the west, seems to impose abiotic constraints to bats\u2019 survival; thereby, no study on bats is expected from this region. In contrast, the north part of the country might have its diversity partially underestimated due to this spatial bias. For example, a new bat species from Beijing\u2013the most studied province in the north of China\u2013was described in this century (Zhang et al., 2007). Furthermore, studying bats living in harsh environmental conditions as in deserts and semiarid zones may help answer physiological adaptation questions (Geiser, 2004; Yuan et al., 2011). Among the 43 physiology-focused studies retrieved in this review, only two examined bats from north China (Jilin province).",

Long-term monitoring studies should also be conducted in these areas to assess population dynamics. However, neglecting other roosting habitats results in an incomplete understanding of the bat community structure (Feij\u00f3 and Rocha, 2017; Flaquer et al., 2007). In addition, species inhabiting forest patches or human settlements near urbanized and agricultural areas are of public health concern due to the higher likelihood of bat-human contact, demanding regular surveillance programs (Nunes et al., 2016). Complementary sampling methods (ground and canopy mist nets, acoustic detectors) should be combined with cave roost surveys in future projects aiming to address community ecology questions.",

Although English-language papers represent the majority of publications in the last decade in China, their proportion is still much lower than in other non-English speaking countries (Gonz\u00e1lez-Alcaide et al., 2012). Non-English papers prevent the research findings from being accessed by a broader audience (Di Bitetti and Ferreras, 2017; Gonz\u00e1lez-Alcaide et al., 2012). This is particularly true for articles written in Mandarin, China\u2019s exclusive language. In addition, English-language papers tend to have a higher citation rate; thereby, higher international recognition [which does not necessarily reflect quality] than non-English articles (Di Bitetti and Ferreras, 2017). Perhaps in a way to partially overcome this language barrier, most of the recent Mandarin articles retrieved in this review have English abstracts. The pros and cons of publishing in non-English or English languages were addressed in more details by Bortolus (2012) and Di Bitetti and Ferreras (2017).",

Museum specimens are temporal and spatial snapshots of biodiversity and limitless source of information to address systematics, taxonomic, ecological, evolutionary, climate change, and public health questions (Suarez and Tsutsui, 2004). Failing to disclose the destination of voucher specimens impedes their use in future studies as well as to ascertain species taxonomic identity. This undesirable practice may lead to negative impacts on the bat community caused by oversampling of collecting sites (Russo et al., 2017). Particularly in Parasitology/Disease studies, collected specimens (if preserved or not) and their whereabouts are often omitted. As detailed by Suarez and Tsutsui (2004), voucher specimens are of major relevance to public health, as they can be used to identify hosts of zoonotic pathogens, trace back the origin and evolution of parasites, and identify potential agents or phenomena related to past and future outbreaks, providing guidance for rapid and efficient actions. Thus, we reinforce the recommendation of the American Society of Mammalogists (Sikes et al., 2016) that all individual collected in nature should be deposited with associated data into an official scientific collection and the museum voucher number should be clearly disclosed in the article.",

Taxonomic revisions are paramount to reveal the actual diversity and to properly define species, the basic unit for conservation actions (Garbino et al., 2018; Mace, 2004; Tsang et al., 2016). In addition, the knowledge about species\u2019 life-history aspects (e.g. Cheng and Lee, 2002; Ho and Lee, 2003; Ma et al., 2006; Park et al., 2000) generated in this century helps to assess the threatened status of bat species and plan effective conservation strategies (Mickleburgh et al., 2002). However, conservation-driven research is needed to draw efficient conservation actions (Weeks and Adams, 2017). For example, although the majority of articles were related to ecological aspects of bats, long-term monitoring studies are still lacking. These studies can provide reliable information about community dynamics and how species respond to climate and human-induced changes (Ingersoll et al., 2013; Meyer et al., 2010). Future projects should also address the effects of human-modified landscapes (i.e., agricultural systems, urbanization, dams, deforestation) on the bat community, and which species are more susceptible to these alterations.",

            "text": "Based on findings and recommendations retrieved from papers during this review, we discuss some priority actions and projects that will help enhance bat protection in China:(i)Strengthen protection of caves used as roosts by bats and their surroundings, in particular, those identified to harbor large colonies and threatened species (see Luo et al. (2013). Because cave tourism is a growing business in China, we should link it with bat conservation through educational events. For example, bat-watching programs have been attracting hundreds of millions of visitors annually to observe the evening emergence of large bat colonies in the United States (see http://www.batcon.org/resources/getting-involved/visit-a-bat-viewing-site). Similar activities can be developed in China to stimulate bat tourism.(ii)The modernization of old buildings in China has restricted the number of available roosts for bats, which contributes to the decline in bat populations (Zhang et al., 2009b). Urbanization is an inevitable process, especially in rapidly developing countries as China, leading to deforestation and fragmentation, well-known major threats to wildlife (lmqvist et al., 2016; McDonald et al., 2013). Particular for bats, urbanization has an uneven effect across species, favoring some while leading others to local extinction (Jung and Threlfall, 2018; Nunes et al., 2016; Russo and Ancillotto, 2015). Nevertheless, in the absence of natural habitats, most of the urban bats seem to be dependent on man-made roosts to survive. Artificial roosts (\u201cbat houses\u201d, \u201cbat boxes\u201d) in urban areas can be used as a mitigation program to enhance roost availability (Mering and Chambers, 2014; Rueegger, 2016), as have been applied in Hong Kong (Chan, 2006; Shek et al., 2012). Additionally, monitoring programs should be coupled to assess bat-boxes effectiveness (Rueegger, 2016).(iii)Increasing landscape connectivity to facilitate bats dispersion among forest fragments is a key factor to prevent massive biodiversity losses in the next decades (Hughes et al., 2012). In this century, multiple afforestation programs have increased 42% of the forest cover in China, the country with the highest greening rate in the world (Chen et al., 2019). China thus represents a model for other developing countries by showing that economic development can be successfully integrate with environmental protection. Liang et al. (2018) identified conservation priority areas and ecological corridors in China that, if preserved, will enhance the landscape connectivity and promote an efficient ecological network. Currently, about 19% of China\u2019s nature reserves are within those priority areas.(iv)Our review shows that threatened and endemic species are those that have received the least attention. Even the basic information on general aspects of home-range, diet, population size, reproduction of threatened and endemic bats are lacking. Thus, we encourage future projects to focus on species with higher extinction risk (see Supplementary SD 3 and 4). Notably, population monitoring programs are particularly important as they can provide both ecological information and reveal the main threats.(v)Successful conservation actions often rely on the engagement with policy-makers and the local population to ensure their long-term efficiency (Andrade and Rhodes, 2012; Superina et al., 2018). Strengthening publicity and education to raise public awareness of bat ecological and economic relevance is highly important, as well as to enroll government managers, policy-makers and private sectors in conservation actions. The ecological services provided by bats should be better quantified and monetized in future projects (e.g. Boyles et al., 2011; Taylor et al., 2018) to highlight their economic value for the Chinese private sector and governments.\n",

Likewise, studies on bats have increased fourfold over the past two decades. Fifty percent of the post-millennium articles were focused on ecology and systematic aspects, resulting in a better understanding of the Chinese bat diversity and species ecological features. Harboring 147 species, China lies among the most bat-rich countries in the world. Nevertheless, the taxonomy and spatial research biases on Chinese bat studies predict a still overlooked diversity. Future systematic/taxonomic projects should target those groups and regions identified in this review as poorly studied, and apply integrative approaches to properly define species boundaries.",

It is noteworthy that the risk of human exposure to pathogens is drastically reduced when bats\u2019 natural habitats and roosting sites are preserved. Therefore, efforts to preserve bats\u2019 habitats have large public health value. They also provide diverse economic services (e.g., suppressors of agricultural pest insects and insects that transmit pathogens to humans, pollinators and seed dispersers of highly economic fruit crop; reviewed by Kunz et al., 2011). Unfortunately, many of these ecosystem benefits remain largely neglected in Chinese studies. We encourage future projects to quantify and monetize bats\u2019 ecosystem services in a way to emphasize their importance for the Chinese private sector and governments.",

The ongoing marked economic development in China has led to an accelerated rate of urbanization, and, ultimately, intensification of wildlife threats. As a consequence, severe decline of bat populations has been reported in recent years. At the bright side, national afforestation programs in this century have increased in about 42% of forest cover in China. The continuation and expansion of these nationwide programs is crucial for a sustainable development, integrating biodiversity preservation into socioeconomic plans.",
