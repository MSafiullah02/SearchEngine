In the United States, extensive debate has ensued as to the risk posed by the disease, whether the health system is prepared to manage a high volume of critical cases, whether any number of public health responses are necessary and appropriate, and the appropriate ways to prevent, manage, and treat the pandemic. We hypothesized that the interplay between scientists, policymakers, and the public in an open forum was associated with increased overall public trust in science and scientists, but that this was moderated by political orientation and/or religious commitment. In the context of a public health emergency, it is important to understand the degree to which science and scientists are trusted to produce information that can provide reassurance and also can explain the details of a highly complex event like a viral pandemic while providing actionable recommendations.",

            "text": "Since the emergence of Covid-19, we have observed a rapid, public back-and-forth exchange between scientific research, policy, and social media that is largely unprecedented. On January 20, 2020, the first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, Covid-19, was reported in the United States (US). 1 Much early communal discussion analyzed the epidemiologic risks posed by the disease within the US, though the preponderance of data remained sourced from international cases. A pre-print scoping review/meta-analysis of 61 studies from January 1, 2019 to February 24, 2020 reported that 13.9% of Covid-19 cases were severe and 4.7% were critical, with an overall case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.1%. 2 The US CFR on the COVID-19 Dashboard at Johns Hopkins University as of April 24 th indicated a 5.7% CFR, though only 4,692,797 total tests had been conducted. 3 Without access to true data (e.g., complete information or data via random sample), debate continued as to the actual severity and CFR. 4 Reasonable and serious concerns were raised that the US healthcare system is under-resourced and understaffed to manage a high volume of Covid-19 cases, which has led to efforts at and calls for selfmonitoring, quarantine, capacity-building and other methods to \"flatten the curve.\" 5 Nonpharmaceutical, behavioral and policy responses to Covid-19 were expected to be a primary mechanism by which the basic reproduction number, R 0 , could be reduced below 1.0. 6 In the time between initial submission and revision of this study, additional public debate has also illustrated tension between differing perspectives and advice on perceptions, treatment, and management of the pandemic, such as continued comparisons between Covid-19 and influenza, 7 the proposed use of hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19, 8 and implementation of and compliance with social distancing measures. 9 The Covid-19 pandemic has produced a large-scale, open, and public epidemiologic investigation and discussion, with contributions from scientists, journalists, clinicians, politicians, and laypeople often shared contemporaneously. [10] [11] Because of the way in which the scientific process, such as making conclusions based on complex epidemiological modeling, has been conducted rapidly and discussed in open forums, public perception of the scientific enterprise may have been altered in some way in the past several months.",

In referring to \"science and scientists\" I did not mean the institutional or governmental implementation of policy based on scientific research, but rather trust in scientists qua scientists, and in the scientific methodology. 12 This was somewhat different from much (though not all) of the prior literature on trust as it relates to science, such as the fairly extensive body of work on vaccine hesitancy, 13 as the focus of this hypothesis was not on a specific set of evidence but rather on the people and processes involved in generating evidence. In this case, for example, I was not concerned with measuring whether individuals believed that Covid-19 was like influenza, but rather whether there was any preliminary evidence that the pandemic shifted how people thought about science itself. In doing so, I was guided by the work of Nadelson et al. (2014), 12 who conceptualized trust as a complex and multifaceted belief, weighted by epistemology (e.g., \"how our degrees of confidence are rationally constrained by our evidence\"). 14 Their instrument measured trust using Likert-type scales capturing a wide variety of components of trust, such as \"When scientists change their mind about a scientific idea it diminishes my trust in their work\" and \"Scientists will protect each other even when they are wrong.\" 12 The way that individuals respond to recommendations or advice regarding public health appears to rely on a variety of factors, among which trust in multiple entities, including government, community, and scientists, appears to play a role. 9, 12 Any such shift in trust is therefore important to understand. Jones (2020) describes prior work explaining epidemics as social dramas involving citizens that include \"desire for self-reassurance\" followed by \"reluctant acknowledgement\" and then a demand for explanations. 15 In this context, too, it is important to understand the degree to which science and scientists are trusted to produce information that can provide reassurance and also can explain the details of a highly complex event like a viral pandemic. We therefore conducted a pilot survey to investigate changes in trust of science and scientists among US adults ages 18+ two months after the first Covid-19 case was identified in the United States.",

Although not the focus of this study, data also indicated substantive differences between liberal and conservative respondents, as well as respondents with low and high levels of religious commitment, in terms of overall trust in science and scientists. These latter findings were consistent with correlations observed in the validation study for the instrument used to measure trust. 12 Research conducted by Gadarian et al. (2020) identified self-placed political ideology as the \"most consistent factor that differentiates' Americans health behaviors\" in the context of Covid-19. 18 Thus, in addition to continued research on changes, if any, brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, it seems that additional investigation into the directionality of influence of political orientation on trust in science/scientists, and vice versa, might be also valuable, especially in cases where health-related advice from scientists and non-scientific entities differs, and individuals are determining whose advice to follow, and in what way.",
