Fight-or-flight is the reaction to danger for survival in the jungle. Humans are part of this. Although some humans are able to remain indoors in critical life-threatening conditions, some others rush towards a new-seemingly natural-horizon, i.e., a village or an island. Is it that architecture in cities fails in offering the adequate natural environmental conditions in order to keep its population indoors or might this behavior be attributed to a more complicated archetypical reason? The best way out of a crisis like COVID-19 is through dwelling indoors. Humans have lived longer in nature than indoors over the timespan of their existence and this might be one of the reasons why some members of society flee towards it in conditions of crisis. However, is this truly the case?",

He was inspired by the \"one-stop-shop\" design of the multiple occupancy condition in ocean liners [1, 2] . Nowadays, in 2020, apart from sporadic cases of design in Europe and Asia, this architectural paradigm has been treated essentially just as part of the literature or even as an \"old-fashioned\" architectural ideology. It has not managed yet to approach the thinking of Le Corbusier in a unified manner and thus the question persists. That is, how can we design units for living in, which can retain occupants in self-sufficient spaces where dwellers can be safe and healthy, physically and mentally?",
