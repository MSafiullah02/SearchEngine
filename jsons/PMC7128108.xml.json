However, through not being able to fully comprehend the essence of the philosophy, many Chinese people mistakenly extend the scope of the homology and simply think that one is made of the supplements they eat. For instance, kidney and penis of deer or tiger are believed to have aphrodisiac effect, and brain of fish or monkey are supposed to make people brighter.",

Eating of other wild animals, such as African snail, frog, bamboo rat, or octopus, has also been broadcasted.
