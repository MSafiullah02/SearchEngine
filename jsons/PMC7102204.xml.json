            "text": "It is now known that in addition to the classical hormonal (tissue-to-tissue) renin-angiotensin system (RAS), there are a paracrine (cell-to-cell) and an intracrine (intracellular/nuclear) RAS. Over the last two decades, all components of the classic RAS have been identified in the brain. Initially, the brain RAS was associated with brain areas involved in the central control of blood pressure. More recently, several studies have shown local RAS in many brain regions and their involvement in several brain disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). We have revealed the presence of a local RAS in the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum of rodents and primates, including humans [1\u20133]. Classically, angiotensin II (Ang II) is the main RAS effector peptide and acts through two major receptors: Ang II type 1 and 2 (AT1 and AT2) receptors [4\u20136]. Ang II is formed by the action of renin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) on the precursor glycoprotein angiotensinogen. In several animal models of parkinsonism, we have investigated the possible role of the brain RAS in dopaminergic degeneration, and we have demonstrated that enhanced activation of the Ang II/AT1 axis exacerbates dopaminergic cell death [7, 8]. Other studies also support the involvement of brain RAS in dopaminergic degeneration [9\u201311]. Furthermore, AT2 receptors have been shown to exert effects opposed to those mediated by Ang II via AT1 receptors [9, 12].",

            "text": "In addition to the above mentioned classical effects via AT1 and AT2 receptors, other components mediate the actions of the RAS, such as (pro)renin receptors (PRR) and other angiotensin-derived peptides, being Ang 1-7 particularly interesting. Ang 1-7 is a hectapeptide which is formed from angiotensin I (Ang I) or Ang II by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The seven-transmembrane G protein-couple receptor Mas is the main receptor for Ang 1-7 [13]. Recently, two different RAS arms have been postulated: a detrimental (i.e., pro-oxidative, pro-inflammatory) arm constituted by the Ang II/AT1 axis and the (Pro)renin/PRR axis and a protective axis constituted by the Ang II/AT2 axis and the Ang 1-7/Mas receptor axis [14, 15]. A few years ago, we described for the first time PRR in nigral dopaminergic neurons and microglial cells in rats, monkeys and humans [1, 2, 16]. However, nothing is known about the protective axis Ang 1-7/Mas receptor in the dopaminergic system. Moreover, we have recently observed the existence of a functional intracrine RAS, in mitochondria and nuclei from rat ventral mesencephalon and dopaminergic cell cultures [17, 18]. However, the possible existence and functional role of an intracellular Ang 1-7/Mas axis remains to be investigated. In the present study, we investigated the presence of major components of the Ang 1-7/Mas receptor axis in the dopaminergic system of different animal and cellular models, including human SN and human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We also studied the possible effects of aging and the interactions between Mas and AT1 and AT2 receptors using knockout (KO) mice. Finally, we investigated the presence and functional effects of an intracellular Ang 1-7/Mas axis, particularly at the mitochondrial and nuclear level.",

In addition, the localization of Mas receptors in dopaminergic neurons isolated from rat SN was confirmed by laser capture microdissection (LCM) and RT-PCR or droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Experiments using human-derived cells were approved by the corresponding committees of the Spanish Advisory Committee for Human Tissue and Cell Donation and Use and of the University of Santiago de Compostela and authorized by the local government. The human postmortem samples were obtained from the Neurological Brain Bank of Navarra (Hospital of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain). Brains were dissected at autopsy from donors who had given informed consent in accordance with the Brain Donation Program of the Government of Navarra (Government directive 23/2001). The samples were obtained from four adult men (33.75 \u00b1 6.4 years old) with no history or histological findings supporting any neurological disease. Following autopsy, brain slices including ventral mesencephalon were obtained, immediately frozen at \u2212 80 \u00b0C, and stored until processing. Postmortem times varied from 2.5 to 6 h. Nonhuman primate tissue was obtained from three adult male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) (4.5\u20135 years old; body weight ranging from 3.8 to 4.5 kg). Animal handling was conducted in accordance with European Council Directive 86/609/EEC and with the Society for Neuroscience Policy on the Use of Animals in Neuroscience Research. The experimental design for monkey experiments was approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Testing of the University of Navarra (ref: 019/2008) as well as by the Department of Health of the Government of Navarra (ref: NA-UNAV-04-08). Rodent experiments were carried out in accordance with the Directive 2010/63/EU and Directive 86/609/CEE and the Spanish RD/53/2013 and were approved by the corresponding committee at the University of Santiago de Compostela. Animals were housed at constant room temperature (RT) (21\u201322 \u00b0C) and 12-h light/dark cycle. All surgery was performed under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia.",

Rats and monkeys were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with a fixative solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.125 M PB, pH 7.4. Once perfusion was completed, the skull was opened, and the brain was removed and stored for 48 h in a cryoprotectant solution. Human brain blocks including the mesencephalon were fixed by immersion in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h and cryoprotected for 48 h. Coronal tissue sections (40-\u03bcm thick) were then cut with a sliding microtome and collected in cryoprotectant solution. Sections at different rostrocaudal levels of the SN were processed for double immunofluorescence for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and Mas receptor. Neuromelanin granules co-localized with TH in human SN sections and were also used as confirmatory markers of dopaminergic neurons. Free-floating tissue sections containing SN were pre-incubated in KPBS-1% BSA with 5% normal donkey serum (Sigma) and 0.03% Triton X-100 for 60 min at RT. Antigen retrieval was required for human SN sections. Tissue sections were then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C in primary antibodies raised against Mas receptor (1:100; AAR-013, Alomone) and TH (1:5000; mouse monoclonal; T2928, Sigma) diluted in KPBS-1% BSA with 5% normal donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100. As several commercial antibodies against G-protein-coupled receptors have problems of specificity, we selected the Mas receptor antibody AAR-013 (Alomone) because its specificity has been demonstrated in previous studies that showed the absence of immunoreactivity in brain tissue from Mas receptor KO mice [25]. The immunoreaction was visualized with the following fluorescent secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Molecular Probes) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Molecular Probes).

In the present study, we observed that the increase in mitochondrial superoxide production, via Ang II/AT1/NOX4, is inhibited by activation of the mitochondrial Ang 1-7/Mas receptor axis (Fig. 7d), supporting a beneficial function of Ang 1-7/Mas receptor axis against mitochondrial oxidative stress production.",

The purity of the sample was confirmed by the absence of the cytosol marker \u03b1-tubulin and the plasma membrane marker Na+/K+-ATPase pump. Using WB, we observed the presence of the Mas receptor and the enzyme ACE2 in isolated nuclei (Fig. 8a, b). This is consistent with our recent study showing the presence of other major RAS receptors (AT1 and AT2) at the nuclear level and their role in modulation of Ang II-induced cell oxidative stress [18]. We then studied the effects of nuclear Ang 1-7/Mas receptor activation on nuclear ROS and RNS levels. Activation of nuclear Mas receptors by Ang 1-7 inhibited the increase in nuclear superoxide induced by Ang II via nuclear AT1 receptors (Fig. 8c). This inhibition was not observed in the presence of the Mas receptor inhibitor A779, which confirmed the action of the natural ligand of Mas receptors at nuclear level. Consistent with our previous work, the increase in superoxide induced by Ang II/AT1 activation was mediated by nuclear Nox4. Nox4 is a constitutive enzyme, and its effects were blocked by treatment with the Nox4 inhibitor thioridazine (Fig. 8c). In addition, Ang 1-7 treatment induced a significant increase in nuclear NO levels, which was not observed in the presence of the Mas receptor antagonist A779 or the NOS inhibitor L-NAME (Fig. 8d). All these data suggest a major role of the Ang 1-7/Mas receptor axis at the nuclear level.\n",

After demonstrating that Ang 1-7 was a ligand of Mas receptor, the Ang 1-7/Mas receptor axis was definitively established as a new arm of the RAS [34]. A local paracrine brain RAS has been identified and associated with several brain disorders such as anxiety and stress [35], depressive illness [36], and others. Over the last decade, we and others have shown a major role of the brain RAS in the progression of dopaminergic neuron degeneration in PD models. We observed that Ang II, via AT1 receptors and activation of the NADPH oxidase complex, induces oxidative stress and exacerbates neuroinflammation in different cellular and animal PD models and contributes to the progression of neurodegeneration. AT2 receptors are known to counteract the actions of AT1 receptors, exerting a neuroprotective role [7, 8, 37].",

However, the new Ang 1-7/Mas receptor RAS arm was not investigated in the dopaminergic system. In the present study, we observed Mas receptor labeling in dopaminergic neurons and glial cells in rat mesencephalic primary cultures and rat substantia nigra (SN). The Mas receptor immunoreactivity was higher in neurons than in astrocytes and microglial cells. Furthermore, we confirmed the presence of Mas receptors in dopaminergic neurons from monkey and human SN. We also observed the presence of Mas receptors in human iPSCs derived from healthy controls and sporadic PD patients. The results confirm those observed in the human nigra. More importantly, the presence of MasR in dopaminergic neurons obtained from iPSCs may be basis for future functional studies investigating possible alterations in the Ang 1-7/MasR axis in iPSCs from PD patients. In the present study, we just used immunohistochemistry, and we did not detect any obvious difference between cells from patients and controls. More detailed and complex studies are necessary to investigate possible functional or structural differences. However, this is beyond the scope of the present general approach showing the presence of an Ang 1-7/MasR axis in dopaminergic neurons. The results obtained with immunological methods were confirmed with different methodological approaches such as laser capture microdissection and digital PCR. We have also observed that the Ang 1-7/Mas axis is downregulated with aging, and the results from AT1 and AT2 KO mice revealed interactions between AT1, AT2, and Mas receptors. Interestingly, we have identified an intracellular (i.e., mitochondrial and nuclear) Ang 1-7/Mas axis that modulates mitochondrial and nuclear levels of superoxide.",

Aging is associated with a pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative state that affects the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons [39\u201341]. We have shown that aging-related dysregulation of nigral RAS is involved in these effects and that aging-related increase in levels of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and dopaminergic cell vulnerability were inhibited by treatment with the AT1 antagonist candesartan. In the present study, we observed a decrease in the protective Ang1-7/Mas axis expression in the SN of aged rats (i.e., a decrease in Mas receptor and ACE2 expression and Ang 1-7 levels). This is consistent with previous studies in aged animals that showed a dysregulation of nigral RAS, particularly an increase in the pro-oxidative AT1 receptor expression and a decrease in the protective AT2 receptor expression [42, 43]. The present data further support that an aging-related decrease in the activity of the RAS protective axis (Ang II/AT2 and Ang 1-7/Mas receptor) and an increase in the activity of the pro-oxidative pro-inflammatory axis (Ang II/AT1) are involved in the higher vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons with aging.",

It has been shown that AT2 and Mas receptors may form heterodimers, as they have similar signaling mechanisms and protective actions [44]. Furthermore, a functional dependence between both receptors has been suggested because Ang 1-7 did not induce any effect in astrocytes from AT2 KO mice, and the AT2 receptor agonist Compound 21 (C21) was ineffective in astrocytes from Mas receptor KO mice [44, 45]. In the SN of AT1 KO mice, we did not observe a significant change in the Mas receptor expression. However, ACE2 and Ang 1-7 levels and ACE2 activity were significantly decreased, which may lead to a decrease in the activity of the Ang 1-7/Mas axis in the absence of the Ang II/AT1 pro-oxidative pro-inflammatory axis. Interestingly, a decrease in the AT2 receptor expression was also observed in the nigra AT1 KO mice [46].",

We observed Ang II and functional AT1 and AT2 receptors in isolated mitochondria from rat brain, which modulate the mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial AT2 receptors are much more abundant than AT1, increase after treatment of cells with oxidative stress inducers, and induce, via nitric oxide, a decrease in mitochondrial respiration [17]. The present data show the presence of Mas receptors in isolated mitochondria from the rat nigral region. However, the expression of this receptor in mitochondria was lower than that observed in the whole cell homogenate. Interestingly, the Ang 1-7-forming enzyme ACE2 was much more abundant at the mitochondrial level than in the whole cell homogenate, suggesting an additional role for this enzyme in the mitochondria. Both ACE (the Ang II forming enzyme) and ACE2 have several substrates that give them multiplicity of functions. The new RAS member alamandine has been shown to be formed by ACE2 from angiotensin A and to act through a Mas-related gene receptor (MrgD) [49]. Another possibility is that Ang 1-7, which is more abundant than Ang II at the mitochondrial level, acts via other mitochondrial receptors (i.e., in addition to Mas receptors). Interestingly, mitochondrial AT2 receptors, which are the most abundant Ang II receptors in mitochondria, have been shown to bind Ang 1-7 in the cardiovascular system [50]. Furthermore, the abovementioned MrgD receptor has also been suggested to be an additional Ang 1-7 receptor [51]. In isolated mitochondria, we have observed that Ang 1-7, via the Mas receptor, induces an increase in mitochondrial nitric oxide production and inhibits the increase in levels of superoxide produced by activation of Ang II/AT1 (i.e., Ang 1-7 protects mitochondria from detrimental effects of the ROS production). These protective effects are similar to those induced by the activation of mitochondrial AT2 receptors [17]. A similar protective effect of Ang 1-7/Mas receptor activation (i.e., reduction of ROS produced by high glucose treatment) was recently reported in cardiomyocytes [52], and in human brain microvascular endothelial cells, where Ang-(1-7) suppressed the Ang II-induced pro-apoptotic activity, ROS overproduction, and NO reduction [53].",

In dopaminergic neurons, we have observed that this inhibitory effect may be exerted at several levels (summarized in Fig. 9), and the mitochondrial level appears as a major site for RAS-related ROS production/modulation. Several previous studies have shown a ROS-mediated interaction (i.e., cross-talk signaling) between the membrane-bound NADPH oxidase complex and the mitochondria, so that ROS generated by the AngII/AT1/NADPH oxidase (Nox2) may act as a trigger to induce the opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (mitoKATP), which leads to an increase in the generation of mitochondrial ROS [10, 45]. In isolated mitochondria, the activation of AT1 mitochondrial receptors produces Nox4-derived superoxide [17]. It is known that increased mitochondrial ROS results in mitochondrial DNA damage and oxidation of mitochondrial proteins, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial-derived ROS also reach the cytoplasm and contribute to cellular dysfunction. In the present study, we have observed that in dopaminergic neurons, Ang 1-7 inhibited the increase in levels of superoxide and changes in cell respiration induced by Ang II. In isolated mitochondria, we observed that Ang II-derived ROS were inhibited in the presence of Ang 1-7. In a previous study [17], we showed that the activation of mitochondrial AT2 receptors leads to inhibition of mitochondrial superoxide, as observed for Ang 1-7 Mas receptors in the present study (see Fig. 9).",

The activation of Mas receptors by their natural ligand Ang 1-7 produced an increase in the nuclear NO production and counteracted the increase in Ang II-derived nuclear superoxide. The activation of nuclear AT2 receptors by Ang II also induced an increase in nuclear NO production and counteracted the increase in nuclear superoxide [18]. Previous studies have shown that extracellular (paracrine) Ang II induces the activation of the cell membrane AT1/Nox2 axis, leading to the generation of intracellular NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide and oxidative stress, but Ang II also induces the internalization of the Ang II-AT1 receptor complex to the nucleus (Fig. 9). We have recently observed that the activation of nuclear AT1 receptors induces an increase in nuclear NOX4/superoxide and IP3/Ca2+ levels, which are known to regulate the gene expression, triggering several mechanisms that may protect cells against oxidative stress [18]. These protective mechanisms include an increase in the expression of AT2 receptor mRNA, which leads to an increase in the levels of protective AT2 receptors that traffic to different cell structures such as mitochondria and cell membrane (i.e., overactivation of the detrimental Ang II/AT1 axis leads to a compensatory increase in the RAS Ang II/AT2 protective arm). In addition, the activation of nuclear AT1 receptors induces an increase in angiotensinogen, renin, and prorenin/renin receptor mRNA, which leads to an increase in the synthesis of intracellular AII and Ang 1-7 to act on intracellular AT2 and Mas receptors [18] (Fig. 9). In the present study, we have observed that the treatment of isolated nuclei with Ang 1-7 does not induce changes in the Mas and AT1 receptor mRNA expression. However, the activation of nuclear Mas receptors by Ang 1-7 induces a decrease in nuclear ROS and in the expression of AT2 receptor mRNA. The results suggest that nuclear Mas and AT2 receptors buffer the protective response (i.e., the enhancement of the Ang II/AT2 protective arm triggered by the activation of nuclear AT1 receptors). Altogether suggests that the nuclear RAS receptors play a pivotal role in maintaining an adequate balance between the cell detrimental and the protective RAS arms (Fig. 9). The present and previous results [18] also reveal that this important function is impaired in aged animals.",

Aging induced a decrease in the activity of the Ang 1-7/Mas protective axis, which may play a role in an aging-related increase in dopaminergic vulnerability to neurodegeneration. Intracellularly, Ang 1-7 is highly expressed at the mitochondrial level and increases mitochondrial levels of nitric oxide via the Mas receptor, leading to a decrease in mitochondrial superoxide production. At the nuclear level, Ang 1-7, via Mas receptors, increases levels of nitric oxide, decreases nuclear superoxide levels, and decreases AT2 mRNA transcription. Nuclear RAS receptors may regulate the adequate balance between the detrimental and the protective arms of the cell RAS. The present data support the beneficial effects of the Ang 1-7/Mas receptor protective arm in the dopaminergic system. In summary, we have observed that the Ang 1-7/Mas receptor axis is present in dopaminergic neurons and counteracts the pro-oxidative effects of the Ang II/AT1 axis, which has been previously shown to enhance progression of neurodegeneration in PD models. Furthermore, the Ang 1-7/Mas receptor axis is downregulated in the aged nigra, and aging is the major risk factor for PD. On this basis, we suggest that the Ang 1-7/MasR axis is involved in counteracting dopaminergic degeneration and progression of PD, and it should be taken into account for the design of new therapeutic strategies for PD.",

ACE2 enzyme presents a higher expression than MasR in isolated mitochondria relative to whole cell homogenate (b). Isolated mitochondria from the nigral region have higher levels of Ang 1-7 than Ang II as measured by specific EIA (n = 3\u20135) (c). Treatment of isolated mitochondria with Ang 1-7 inhibits the increase in mitochondrial superoxide production induced by the activation of mitochondrial AT1 receptors (Ang II + the AT2 receptor antagonist PD123,319). Superoxide is produced via Nox4, as the Nox4 inhibitor thioridazine blocked the AT1-induced superoxide production. The inhibitory effect of Ang 1-7 was not observed in the presence of the MasR antagonist A779, which confirmed that Ang 1-7 acts through MasR in isolated mitochondria (n = 4) (d).

            "text": "Fig. 9: Model of the role that the intracellular MasR plays, interacting with AT1 and AT2 receptors, in modulating the pro-oxidative effects of the activation of membrane AT1 receptors by extracellular (i.e., paracrine) angiotensin II (AII). Extracellular AII induces activation of the membrane the AT1-Nox2 axis, leading to the generation of intracellular superoxide and oxidative stress (red arrows) [3, 8, 33]. Extracellular AII also induces the internalization of the AII-AT1 receptor complex to the nucleus (green arrows; 18). Internalized and intracellularly produced AII is transformed by ACE2 into A1-7, which acts on MasR. Activation of nuclear AT1 receptors induces an increase in nuclear NOX4/superoxide levels, which are known to regulate gene expression, and triggers a number of mechanisms that protect cells against oxidative stress (green arrows; 18). These protective mechanisms include (i) an increase in the expression of AT2 receptor mRNA, which leads to an increase in the levels of protective AT2 receptors that traffic to different cell structures such as mitochondria and cell membrane, inducing a compensatory increase in the RAS protective arm (i.e., AII/AT2); and (ii) an increase in angiotensinogen, renin, and prorenin/renin receptor mRNA, which leads to an increase in the synthesis of intracellular AII to act on intracellular AT2 receptors and MasR (via ACE2/A1-7). Nuclear MasR and AT2 [18] receptors modulate this process (via NOS; red lines) by counteracting the effects of nuclear AT1 receptors.
