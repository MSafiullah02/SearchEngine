IP3 increases intracellular calcium levels by inducing the release of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium stores. The released intracellular Ca2+ leads to the translocation of additional PLC\u03b32 to the plasma membrane, where its activation leads to the sustained influx of extracellular Ca2+ across the plasma membrane [1].",

The majority of these mutations occur in the autoinhibitory C-terminal SH2 domain, conferring gain-of-function activity (Fig. 2a). These PLCG2 variants have also been described as somatic mutations causing clonal expansion in Ibrutinib-resistant chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [5]. Another hotspot region in the PLC\u03b32 protein associated with Ibrutinib resistance mutations is amino acids 1139 to 1141 within the C2 domain which is involved in calcium binding and membrane anchoring of PLC\u03b32 [6].",

Variants were called using mpileup (SAMtools), subsequently filtered with varFilter, and annotated using an in-house pipeline that combines SnpEff [9], Ensembl variant database (including pathogenicity prediction), dbSNP [10], NHLBI exome sequencing database (https://esp.gs.washington.edu/drupal/), COSMIC [11], and an in-house human variation database [12]. Annotated variants were then filtered: (1) according to the inheritance mode, (2) ExAC Browser (exac.broadinstitute.org) and (3) previous reported pathogenicity with a phenotype of B cell defects in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and ClinVar databases. There were 193 unique variants identified of which PLCG2 was considered to be the most suitable for further evaluation based on in silico modeling and its known role in B cell development. The heterozygous variant was identified in 50 of 96 reads.",

            "text": "In antigen-stimulated B cells, the first transient Ca2+ flux is caused by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) binding to IP3 receptors (IP3R), which triggers rapid Ca2+ release from finite internal Ca2+ stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This initial phase of receptor-activated Ca2+ signaling is followed by a sustained influx of extracellular Ca2+ across the plasma membrane [1, 29]. The C2 domain of PLC\u03b32, in which this mutation resides, has previously been shown to play two roles in this second phase. Firstly, the initial Ca2+ flux via IP3R promotes lipase-independent translocation of additional PLC\u03b32 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane leading to more production of IP3 and DAG after binding to the adapter protein BLNK [1]. DAG in turn activates more influx of Ca2+ by directly activating transient receptor potential cation (TRPC) Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane [30]. The C2 domain is critical for this Ca2+ entry\u2013dependent translocation of PLC\u03b32 as deletion of one of the expected Ca2+ binding sites in the C2 domain of PLC\u03b32 (\u03941138E-1140D) results in the absence of this second sustained phase [1]. The proximity of the amino acid substitution in the patient\u2019s PLC\u03b32 (M1141K) to this putative calcium-binding site may result in the formation of a higher affinity Ca2+ binding site, leading to increased IP3 and DAG production. Secondly, binding of the PLC\u03b32 SH2 domain to BLNK is stabilized by the PLC\u03b32 C2 domain in a Ca2+-regulated manner [31]. Interestingly, total deletion of the C2 domain in PLC\u03b32 ablated both intracellular and extracellular BCR-triggered Ca2+ responses [1]. The additional requirement of the C2 domain for the initial BCR-mediated Ca2+ flux could be explained by the universal role of C2 domains in promoting binding to phospholipid bilayers. A mutation within the C2 domain has the potential to affect the association of PLC\u03b32 with the plasma membrane. For example, mutants that increase the positive surface charge of the C2 domain in p110\u03b1, a catalytic subunit of PI3K involved in tonic BCR signaling, lead to a gain-of-function [32]. This is analogous to our variant as methionine is substituted with positively charged lysine at position 1141.",

IgM receptor-induced Ca2+ flux and proliferation in response to B cell mitogens was absent. Ig levels were reduced and T cell\u2013independent antibody production was absent. Fc\u03b3R signaling was also defective, resulting in a loss of collagen-induced platelet aggregation, mast cell Fc\u03b5R function, and NK cell Fc\u03b3RIII and 2B4 function [35]. Targeted deletion of Plc\u03b32 in germinal center B cells demonstrated an additional essential role in the maintenance of memory B cells [36]. To date, there are no reported cases of humans with PLC\u03b32 deficiency. This suggests that PLC\u03b32 activity may be tightly regulated in normal B cell development; a decrease in PLC\u03b32 activity results in diminished BCR signaling that strongly impairs development of transitional B cells [37], while BCR hyper-reactivity causes B cell apoptosis.

After overnight incubation, the transfected DT40 cells were incubated in Ca2+-free media and stimulated via BCR followed by addition of exogenous Ca2+. Each data point is representative of three independent experiments with measurements shown in 15-s intervals. Viable cells were analyzed for 60 s prior to BCR stimulation in order to establish an average baseline by which the relative fold increase in fluorescence is measured. b Western blot showing equal transfection expression of PLC\u03b32 constructs",
