In this study, three different convolutional neural network based models (ResNet50, InceptionV3 and Inception-ResNetV2) have been proposed for the detection of coronavirus pneumonia infected patient using chest X-ray radiographs. ROC analyses and confusion matrices by these three models are given and analyzed using 5-fold cross validation. Considering the performance results obtained, it is seen that the pre-trained ResNet50 model provides the highest classification performance with 98% accuracy among other two proposed models (97% accuracy for InceptionV3 and 87% accuracy for Inception-ResNetV2).",

They have obtained 95.38% of accuracy for ResNet50&SVM. Fei et al.[14], tried to predict COVID-19 patients using \"VB-Net\" neural network to segment COVID-19 infection regions in CT scans.

Xiaowei et al.[15], proposed an early prediction model to classification COVID-19 pneumonia from Influenza-A viral pneumonia and healthy cases using pulmonary CT images using deep learning techniques. Their CNN model has yielded the highest overall accuracy was 86.7 % CT images. Shuai et al.[16], used CT images to predict COVID-19 cases.
