Influential United Nations publications have highlighted the low levels of human development in the region despite it being the overwhelming source of Nigeria's vast oil wealth (UNDP, 2006) and the profound and systematic devastation of its environment and fragile wetlands ecosystem by decades of oil production (UNEP, 2011).",

Although much of the Niger Delta is often presented in terms of \u201cvillages\u201d or \u201cthe rural areas\u201d; in reality, these villages often have rudimentary houses tightly packed together in surprisingly densely populated small areas. A typical village house will host four-seven people in it and be located just a few feet away from other such houses. The lack of accessible piped drinking water and adequate sanitation make frequent hand washing difficult. Most Niger Delta villagers will never have free access into an oil company facility, but they know that oil workers have dramatically better health care facilities than they do. This will surely increase resentment as their increased exposure to the disease risk is exacerbated by their comparative material poverty and the adverse economic effects of the lock-down.",

This mixture contains high quantities of carbohydrates, protein and considerable amounts of fat, minerals, fiber and moisture. It is a good source of nutrients and energy for growing children. The fat content of soybeans is a rich source of omega-3 fatty acid (fish oil) which plays a significant medical role in the treatment of heart diseases. The Ogi Soy Plus is typically prepared either in what Nigerians call a \u201cpap\u201d formula (porridge or oatmeal-like consistency) or in a dry formula which can be mixed into rice. Various other foods such as scotch eggs, sweet bread, fish rolls or ripe plantains in egg sauce are used to help the children eat their entire serving of Ogi Soy Plus which is what does the heavy nutritional lifting in this program.",

Worldwide malnutrition estimates indicate that 35.8% of preschool children in developing countries are underweight, 42.7% are stunted, and 9.2% are wasted (Manyike, et.al., 2014). We based our nutrition program selection criteria on the findings of our pre project questionnaire, findings of medical and physical examinations including laboratory investigations and dietary history of 100 pupils. Children of the poor, orphans, immuno-compromised and children with sickle cell anaemia were prioritized. Feeding was done using a control randomized trial study with 50 pupils feeding on Ogi Soy Plus and another 50 not receiving the product as a control.

Our previous method of feeding the kids all in one large room to make serving them easier and to allow the other classrooms to be used for classes for the children not enrolled in the nutrition program would no longer be viable because the children were packed in tightly (see photo 1\n). We did not want to abandon the nutrition program as the children are only likely to get even more malnourished as COVID 19 restrictions further minimize their parents\u2019 ability to feed them. We discussed this with the parents who all agreed that they wanted the program to continue. As such, on March 27, 2020 we had our first socially distanced feeding with the children spread out across four or five different classrooms to enable us to maintain the requisite amount of distance between them (see photo 2\n). This level of social distancing would not previously have been possible when the other kids were in attendance and those classrooms were in use.
