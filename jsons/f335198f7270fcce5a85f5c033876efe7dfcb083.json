Following postnatal growth, the mitotic index in the rodent lung was calculated to be less than 0.4% per day. 2 In tracheal epithelial cells, 4-week-old rats had a turnover of about 1 month, whereas very low mitotic activity has been identifi ed in the epithelial cells of the postgrowth trachea and terminal bronchiolar epithelium. 3 Prolonged studies achieved by the addition of radiolabeled thymidine to drinking water have demonstrated that alveolar epithelial cells can survive for 125 days in young animals. 4 These observations were obscured by the prolonged period of postnatal alveolar growth that occurs in animals and humans. When labeling of alveolar wall cells was considered relative to age, cell turnover in the alveolar epithelium was noted to decrease even further. 5 Thus, in the absence of injury, the epithelial cells of all lung compartments are mitotically quiescent.",

Programs for repair are directed by epithelial, mesenchymal, and infl ammatory signals that collectively constitute highly regulated networks. Principal components of the repair network are developmental morphogens, integrin and growth factor signaling molecules, and transcription factors. The epithelium responds to these signals with a remarkable plasticity and is bulwarked by a population of lung progenitor cells to ensure maintenance and repair for fl uid balance and host defense functions.",

Epithelial cell responses have been studied by numerous methods, initially based on morphologic image analysis, cell radiolabeling, and more recently by immunolabeling of molecular markers, receptors, ligands, and genetic tags for lineage analysis. Together, these data have been integrated with a classic injury-wound healing paradigm to create a multistage model (Figure 45.1) . Although specifi c injury/repair responses initiate programs, the resulting steps of epithelial differentiation for repair recapitulate embryonic patterns. In the pathologic state, repair programs are perturbed, leading to states characterized by fi brosis, metaplasia, or carcinogenesis.",

The proximal airway epithelium lines the trachea and bronchi and forms the attendant bronchial glands. The distal airway includes bronchiolar epithelium that extends to the junction of the alveolar ducts. Major epithelial types of the airway include ciliated, secretory (Clara), mucous (goblet), and basal cells. Neuroendocrine tive response was observed over 50 years ago following direct wound injury of the tracheas of rats 7 and subsequently in large numbers of in vivo and in vitro models utilizing mechanical injury in airway and alveolar cell models. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] A similar pattern of behavior is often observed in respiratory epithelial cells injured by chemical or infectious agents, suggesting a stereotypical repair program. [16] [17] [18] Although not a simple linear process, the programmed response to injury and repair can be condensed into a model, shown in Figure Although shown for an airway epithelial cell model, concepts are similar during alveolar epithelial cell repair. 15 Each of these stages involves participation of multiple factors that are directed by the mesenchymal and epithelial cells. For the purpose of this section, we discuss repair after classic wounding that includes loss of the epithelial cell barrier and, critically, disruption of the basement membrane and underlying interstitial matrix. However, injured epithelial cells may also be selectively removed without disruption of the basement membrane.",

The uppermost layer (adjacent to the epithelial cells) is composed primarily of laminin-5 and laminin-10, while the lower layer is collagen IV. 19 The layers are connected by entactin/nidogen and multiple, highly charged, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) that are distributed throughout the basement membrane. 19,20 The underlying interstitial matrix contains fi broblasts in a fi brillar collagen (types I and III) matrix with additional HSPGs. Following disruption of the epithelial cell layer and basement membrane, a provisional matrix is formed predominantly by passive leakage of serum factors from local vasculature into the disrupted epithelial basement membrane and into the exposed airspace. 6,21 Cellular components including red blood cells (passively) and neutrophils (actively) move into the wound. The serum components form a fi brin clot that is present for up to 4 days. 7 In acute alveolar injury, the \"hyaline membranes\" seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are an example of exuberant provisional matrix after breach of epithelial and endothelial barriers. 22 Inhibitors of fi brinolysis, such as serine protease inhibitors, are present at this point to stabilize the provisional matrix. 23 The passive provisional matrix formation is accompanied by active production of fi bronectin by fi broblasts and epithelial cells. 24 Although many molecules compose the provisional matrix, the major factors are fi brin (most prominently), fi bronectin, and vitronectin.",

First, as discussed earlier, a change in basement membrane composition as mediated by epithelial and mesenchymal cell secretion occurs rapidly to provide barrier protection and matrixdependent signals for epithelial cells and fi broblasts. 32 Second, epithelial cells, in response to matrix and growth factors, dedifferentiate, stretch, and migrate to cover the basement membrane for reestablishment of functional epithelial cells for barrier, host defense, and fl uid equilibrium. Third, proteolytic cleavage of the provisional matrix returns the steady-state composition. 33 Using morphologic methods, these changes are observed to occur within hours following mechanical injury. 8, 11 Epithelial Cell Dedifferentiation Soon after injury (1-2 hr), the epithelial cells at the edge of the wound undergo dynamic cytoskeletal rearrangement resulting in changes in morphology, featuring formation of lamellipodia. 14 This is the result of the loss of components of cell-matrix and cell-cell junctions leading to dissolution of focal adhesions, adherens junctions, and hemidesmosomes, untethering of intermediate fi laments, and thus reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.

Fibronectin is the most potent promigratory substance for these cells. 12, 28 There is a switch in the expression of integrin receptors on epithelial cells during injury that facilitates migration over the provisional matrix. During steady state, the matrix-associated receptors in lung epithelial cells are predominantly collagen and laminin binding integrins (\u03b12\u03b21, \u03b13\u03b21, and \u03b16\u03b24) but \u03b15 and \u03b1v are not present. 43 With injury, integrins \u03b15 and \u03b1v are expressed on epithelial cells at the wound edge. 43 These integrins are specifi c receptors for RGD epitopes in fi bronectin and vitronectin and are required for migration. 12, 28 Fibroblasts also express \u03b15 to facilitate migration on fi bronectin.

These proteases function by releasing epithelial cell-cell junctions and primordial contacts with the matrix. Of the MMPs, both MMP-7 and MMP-9 are required for normal airway epithelial cell migration. 46,47 Migrating epithelial cells secrete MMP-7 (matrilysin) in a basolateral direction to degrade the extracellular domain of E-cadherin, 46 contributing to cell detachment and spreading at the wound edge. Gelatinase B (MMP-9) releases lamellipodia of migrating cells from the matrix surface to allow extension. 47,48 Tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 present in early wounding inhibits all secreted MMPs (including MMP-7 and MMP-9). A defi ciency of this antiprotease accelerates wound closure. 49 Serum-derived serine protease plasminogen within the wound is activated to plasmin by uroplasminogen activator secreted by bronchial epithelial cells. 50 The primary role of plasmin is fi brinolysis of the provisional fi brin plug. Plasmin also promotes MMP synthesis and activation. 48 Plasmin activator inhibitor-1 is also present and blocks migration by binding to and obscuring vitronectin epitopes. 51 Fibroblasts also require proteases for migration, and membrane type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP, MMP-14) may be crucial for migration through fi brillar collagen and fi brin. 52 Additionally, infl ammatory cells present in the wound can alter the activation of these proteases and alter the epitopes present in the provisional matrix. 53",

Lineage tagging by conditional recombination in mice engineered with airway and alveolar epithelial cell specifi c promoters that drive cell markers has identifi ed a single pool of progenitor epithelial cells present during early lung development. 64 Within fully formed adult lung, injury models reveal regional niches (proximal airway, distal airway, alveolar) for progenitor cells. 34,64-66 These lung cells are considered to be slow cycling but can give rise to progenitor cells that are capable of further cell division (transit amplifying cells). In the proximal airway, a niche of labelretaining cells has been localized within the submucosal glands and basal cells of the mouse trachea. 65, 67 The expression of cell cycle protein Ki-67 in basal cells of cystic fi brosis bronchi identifi es a similar proliferating population in human disease. 68 In the distal airways, naphthalene injury models suggest that pulmonary neuroendocrine cells provide a protective niche for label-retaining Clara-like cells that are capable of epithelial reconstitution. 35 Similar studies identifi ed injury-resistant cells expressing Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) at the bronchoalveolar duct junction that are reparative. 34 Consistent with this, in the terminal airways of humans, 20%-40% of the proliferating cells express CCSP. 69 Cells expressing ciliated cell markers (e.g., transcription factor Foxj1) were not observed to proliferate in naphthalene or virus injury models. 17,38 Progenitor cells that repair the alveolar epithelium are less well defi ned.

Although these families have been studied in detail during lung development (specifi cally in branching morphogenesis), their roles in repair are not as well defi ned. Wnt signaling regulates cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. 36, 80 The canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway involves the binding of Wnt ligands to the receptor complex and regulation of \u03b2-catenin. Noncanonical Wnt signaling, such as utilized by Wnt5, is required for normal alveolar differentiation and alters expression of Shh and BMP4. 80 Sonic hedgehog is expressed in developing lung epithelium where it signals through its receptor Patch to activate the transcription factor Gli. Gli1 and Gli2 are expressed in developing lung mesenchymal cells budding from the foregut and instruct the tracheal epithelial cells during branching morphogenesis. 81 However, Shh and Gli are also highly expressed in the epithelium following naphthalene injury and are upregulated in small cell lung cancer. 82 Overactivation of the Shh pathway results in proliferation and perturbation of differentiation, notably in epithelial neuroendocrine cells of the lung, but the role in normal lung epithelial cells is unclear. 82 BMP4 is expressed in the lung epithelium, regulates proximal-distal patterning, and is required for normal alveolar epithelial cell differentiation. 83 This pathway may be interrupted in infl ammatory states where activation of transcription factor NF-\u03baB has been shown to alter epithelial-mesenchymal signaling through interruption of BMP4 in a chick lung model. 84 ",

Signaling occurs after homo-or heterodimerization of receptor family members. At steady state, EGF receptors are localized predominantly on the basolateral surface of epithelial cells, providing ligand-receptor exclusion. Following injury, there is redistribution of receptors to apical cell surfaces, enhancing ligand-receptor interaction and subsequent repair. 79, 92, 97 Epidermal growth factor, TGF-\u03b1, and other ligands are elevated in human disease (e.g., cystic fi brosis, asthma) and cell and animal models of airway and alveolar epithelial cell injury. 68, [97] [98] [99] Transforming Growth Factor-\u03b2 Family Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 functions in both epithelial maintenance and injury-repair. 21, 58 The three TGF-\u03b2 forms all signal through the same receptor but have unique functions. 100 Abundant latent TGF-\u03b2 is stored within the extracellular matrix at steady state and is activated after injury through proteolytic and nonproteolytic mechanisms. 58 Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 activation results in increased synthesis of matrix factors by epithelial cells and fi broblasts, differentiation of epithelial cells, enhanced survival and proliferation of fi broblasts, inhibition and apoptosis of infl ammatory cells, and maturation of certain infl ammatory cell subsets. Failure to activate TGF-\u03b2 in the lung matrix results in excessive infl ammation and lung destruction. 101 Excessive or prolonged TGF-\u03b2 activation leads to fi brosis (see Chapter 46). It also prevents normal epithelial cell differentiation due to TGF-\u03b2 signaling via Smad that inhibits TITF-1 to subsequently reduce surfactant protein gene expression. 102 Additionally, TGF-\u03b2 promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transdifferentiation. 103 ",

Hepatocyte growth factor is increased in human and animal models of lung injury, in part through proinfl ammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1 and IL-6) that stimulate HGF secretion from fi broblasts. 59 Following alveolar epithelial cell injury, HGF secretion precedes FGF-7 111 and is temporally related to type II cell DNA synthesis during the cell proliferation phase, suggesting that HGF is a prominent mitogen in ARDS. 59 Epithelial Cell Repair Following Prototypic Injuries Human diseases characterized by respiratory epithelial cell injury provide insight into normal and abnormal repair mechanisms. Epithelial injury and repair occur commonly after respiratory viral and bacterial infections but may also occur with acid aspiration or toxic gas or steam inhalation. In contrast, chronic injury associated with cigarette smoking, asthma, and chronic bronchitis results in an interruption of normal repair. Normal and pathogenic mechanisms that follow acute respiratory epithelial injury in human disease demonstrate the importance of each stage of the injury-repair model described earlier (see Figure 45 .1). Below, events occurring during repair of the airway after respiratory virus infection (Figure 45.2) and of the alveolar epithelium in ARDS demonstrate the relevance of the repair model.",

Foxj1 expression was not detected in proliferating cells identifi ed by bromodeoxyuridine labeling, 17 suggesting mature ciliated cells are nonmitotic. Instead, it is more probable that Foxj1 is important for late-stage ciliogenesis. 88 The sequence of differentiation during the repair phase, including the lag of CCSP expression relative to the appearance of cilia markers, is similar to that seen in the developing lung, supporting the idea that repair recapitulates development. 85 ",

Diffuse alveolar damage, the histologic correlate of acute lung injury/ARDS has been subdivided into three phases that parallel the wound-repair model. 22 The early exudative phase (days 1-7) is characterized by necrosis of pneumocytes and endothelial cells and by interstitial and alveolar edema with hemorrhage and hyaline membranes.
