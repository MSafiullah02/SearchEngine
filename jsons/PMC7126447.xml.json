            "text": "The prevention of infectious complications after SOT is paramount, and careful pretransplant evaluation for risks from infectious diseases should be conducted in all potential recipients. Comprehensive recommendations for the evaluation of SOT candidates and all other aspects of transplant-related infectious diseases have been recently summarized in guidelines from the American Society of Transplantation (AST) Infectious Diseases Community of Practice.5 Consultation with a specialist in infectious diseases in transplant should always be considered as part of the pretransplantation evaluation. A careful medical, social, and travel history should be performed to ascertain any potential exposures to problem pathogens (such as endemic mycoses or parasitic infections) so that appropriate risk stratification can occur, including consideration of specific posttransplantation prophylaxis. Vaccine histories should be reviewed, with careful attention paid to completion of childhood vaccination series (ie, measles/mumps/rubella), history of infection with pathogens such as varicella (chicken pox), and maintenance of adult vaccination schedules.6 In many cases, the patient\u2019s primary disease process may render him or her functionally immunosuppressed, so initiation of missed or delayed vaccine series should begin as early in the transplant evaluation as possible, especially for live attenuated vaccines such as varicella vaccine (Varivax Merck, West Point, PA, USA), which are currently contraindicated after SOT. If vaccination must be delayed until after transplant, most centers defer administration until 3 to 6 months after transplantation or until baseline immunosuppression levels are achieved. The vaccine status of household contacts and family members should also be assessed for the optimal protection of the transplant recipient, and should be up to date before transplantation, if possible. Current recommendations for routine adult vaccines are summarized in Table 1\n.6\n",

A recent prospective multicenter cohort study by the Resistra group showed that despite 3 months of CMV-directed viral prophylaxis, 10% of postlung transplant pneumonias reported were caused by CMV.9 Lung transplant recipients have the highest risk of developing CMV disease among all SOT recipients, although the risk of CMV has decreased over time.10 This situation is likely because of the combination of the large CMV viral load that is transmitted via a CMV-positive lung allograft relative to other types of allografts and the more intensive immunosuppression often required in lung transplant recipients, as well as other common risk factors shared by other organ recipients.4 These risk factors include the serostatus of the donor and recipient, with a seronegative recipient of a seropositive organ at the highest risk, the presence of allograft rejection, the use of induction immunosuppression, and the presence of concurrent infections (primarily with other viruses). Areas under recent investigation include defects in CMV-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI), polymorphisms in various components of the innate immune system, and other host factors such as renal dysfunction.11\n",

Recent interest has also focused on the indirect effects of CMV, which include immunomodulatory effects of the virus that increase the risk of developing other opportunistic infections (human herpesvirus 6 [HHV-6], HHV-7, EBV, fungal, and bacterial), EBV-related posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease, and increased risk of both acute and chronic rejection of the allograft.13 The contribution of CMV to the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is still being investigated, with conflicting results as reported in a recent systematic review and several single-center publications.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 A more recent single-center study by Snyder and colleagues20 reported a 21% posttransplant incidence of CMV pneumonitis, and found an increased risk of subsequent BOS in both univariate and multivariate analyses (hazard ratio of 1.88 to 2.11 depending on time dependence).",

            "text": "There have been significant advances in CMV-specific diagnostic testing recently, and in many cases CMV infection or disease is initially diagnosed based on the detection of viremia. In the last decade, quantitative nucleic acid testing, primarily via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), has become the most widely accepted method of CMV viral load monitoring. The previous modality, CMV antigenemia detection via pp65 antigen detection in peripheral white blood cells, has fallen out of favor because of its relative insensitivity and labor intensity. However, the lack of standardization of CMV nucleic acid testing platforms and procedures across many laboratories produces significant interlaboratory variability.21 This situation can make interpretation of viral load results obtained from different laboratories problematic, and also poses problems for establishing uniform viral load cutoffs for positive and negative results. One promising area in CMV diagnostics is the measurement of CMV-specific CMI as a predictor of the development of CMV viremia and disease after the completion of primary prophylaxis. A recent study by Kumar and colleagues22 used a commercially available CD8+ CMV-specific interferon \u03b3 release assay (QuantiFERON-CMV, Cellestis, Valencia, CA, USA) to test serial CMV-specific CMI in SOT recipients during a 3-month posttransplant CMV prophylaxis period. Postprophylaxis CMV disease (within the first 6 months after transplant) occurred in 22.9% of patients with no detectable CMV-specific CMI, versus 5.3% in patients with a positive QuantiFERON-CMV result, suggesting a possible role in predicting late-onset CMV disease. CMV-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays and intracellular cytokine staining followed by flow cytometry have also been studied as predictors of CMV viremia and disease, but these assays have not been standardized and may not be readily available at all transplant centers and are not currently recommended for routine patient monitoring.23\n",

There are 2 generally accepted strategies for CMV prophylaxis in solid-organ transplantation: universal prophylaxis (administration of antivirals to all at-risk individuals) and preemptive therapy (administration of antivirals only to individuals with demonstrable viral replication). These strategies have not been compared in a randomized fashion in lung transplantation specifically, but the current expert opinion of both societies favors the use of universal prophylaxis in high-risk patients, including lung transplant recipients. Initial universal prophylaxis strategies used intravenous ganciclovir only, but with the development of the oral prodrug valganciclovir most centers have switched to oral valganciclovir exclusively, or oral valganciclovir after a short course of intravenous ganciclovir immediately after transplantation because similar efficacy has been shown with both medications.25 Some centers add CMV hyperimmune globulin to universal prophylaxis regimens, but this has not been evaluated in a randomized fashion.18, 26 Significant uncertainty remains regarding the appropriate duration of prophylaxis. Recent trials have suggested that extending prophylaxis to 1 year or longer after transplant may reduce CMV-related complications, but these trials had significant limitations.15, 27 Recently, the first prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing short-course (3 months) with long-course (12 months) prophylaxis with valganciclovir in at-risk lung transplant recipients (positive donor or recipient serologic status) was reported by Palmer and colleagues.28 After completing an initial 3-month course of valganciclovir, patients were randomized to either placebo (short course) or continued prophylaxis (long course) and subsequently followed for the development of CMV disease until month 13 after transplantation. The investigators found 4% of long-course prophylaxis patients developed CMV disease during the trial, versus 32% of short-course patients. No significant differences were found in CMV resistance, adverse events, or acute rejection episodes between the groups during the observation period. Only a subset of study patients was followed for the development of CMV disease beyond the first 13 months after transplant. However, late CMV disease rates were low in both groups (only 3% in long-course and 2% in short-course subjects), suggesting that a longer duration of prophylaxis may not simply delay onset CMV disease but may also reduce the overall incidence.28 Whether additional studies examining varying durations of prophylaxis between 3 and 12 months or involving longer-term CMV surveillance after prophylaxis will confirm these findings is unknown. Reinitiation of CMV prophylaxis should be considered during the treatment of acute rejection if antilymphocyte antibody therapy or high-dose steroids are used.",

Not only does the preemptive approach require frequent blood work with rapid access and reaction to results, but there is also concern about whether weekly testing might miss the onset of periods of rapid viral replication and thus risk the development of more severe CMV disease before treatment can be initiated, especially in higher-risk D+/R\u2212 and lung transplant recipients in general. It is also unknown whether low-level CMV viral replication may facilitate increased indirect effects of the virus, including rejection. There are limited data regarding the use of preemptive prophylaxis in the lung transplant setting specifically, with no large, randomized trials available. These studies have raised concerns about earlier onset of CMV disease and higher rates of ganciclovir resistance in D+/R\u2212 patients receiving preemptive therapy, and highlight the need for further research in this area.29, 30, 31\n",

Treatment should be continued for a minimum of 2 to 3 weeks and until the cessation of viral replication has been verified and any CMV-attributable symptoms have resolved. Quantitative nucleic acid testing or antigenemia testing should be performed on a weekly basis during treatment to follow virologic response to therapy, and confirmation of resolution of viremia with consecutive negative tests at least 7 days apart is recommended before completion of therapy. Secondary prophylaxis with lower-dose valganciclovir (900 mg daily adjusted for renal function) can be considered for high-risk patients after completion of CMV treatment, especially those in whom reduction of immunosuppression is not possible. The addition of CMV hyperimmune globulin for more severe CMV disease, such as pneumonitis, may be considered. Patients who fail to respond to standard antiviral therapy should be suspected of having ganciclovir-resistant CMV disease and should be evaluated with genotypic resistance testing for mutations in the viral UL97 and UL54 gene products.10, 23 Additional therapy with the more toxic antiviral agents foscarnet or cidofovir may be required in these cases.34 Infectious diseases consultation should be considered for patients with suspected or documented CMV resistance.",

No vaccine is licensed for the prevention of RSV, and antiviral treatment strategies are controversial. Supportive care with the reduction of immunosuppression if possible is universally recommended.40 The use of ribavirin in transplant recipients remains controversial because of the lack of controlled studies in this population. Aerosolized ribavirin is commonly used in the pediatric population for seasonal RSV bronchiolitis, and limited data suggest a benefit in lower tract disease in the stem cell transplant population.42 The addition of high-dose steroids and adjunctive antibody-based therapies such as palivizumab, RSV immunoglobulin (Ig), or intravenous immunoglobulin is controversial. Two small case series suggest a role for parenteral or oral ribavirin in lung transplant patients specifically.43, 44 Both studies treated patients with ribavirin (1 with an oral formulation, 1 with intravenous) plus high-dose oral or parenteral corticosteroids until repeated nasopharyngeal swabs were negative. After a median follow-up of greater than 300 days in both studies, all subjects had full recovery of FEV1 (forced expiratory volume after 1 second) after resolution, and only 1 case of late BOS was identified out of 23 total subjects. The oral ribavirin study reported no adverse events,44 and the intravenous study reported a mild but reversible hemolytic anemia.43 Randomized studies are needed to fully assess the usefulness of ribavirin in this population.

Historically, patients with CF who were colonized with B cepacia before transplant had poorer outcomes than those who were not colonized, leading to the exclusion of these patients from consideration for transplantation. However, recent studies have revealed that 9 genetically distinct species (genomovars) make up the B cepacia complex (BCC), with B cenocepacia (genomovar III) and B multivorans (genomovar II) causing the bulk of disease in patients with CF.49 This finding has allowed for more precise study of specific BCC genomovars in the context of lung transplantation, and several recent studies have suggested that infection with B cenocepacia specifically is a risk factor for poor outcome after transplantation.50, 51, 52 These studies all found an increased risk of death among patients infected with B cenocepacia, whereas those infected with non-cenocepacia species did not have significantly worse outcomes than uninfected controls. In addition, in the study by Murray and colleagues,52 the subset of patients infected with nonepidemic strains of B cenocepacia had a higher risk of death compared with transmissible or epidemic strains, which were not significantly different from uninfected patients. These investigators\u2019 data also suggested that infection with B gladioli before transplantation was associated with an increased risk of death. Taken together, these new data suggest that more specific selection criteria might be established based on the specific BCC genomovar isolated (ie, B cenocepacia vs B multivorans), the presence of nonepidemic versus epidemic strains of B cenocepacia, or the presence of B gladioli. This strategy may allow access to transplantation for patients with CF with BCC who are at lower/standard risk for posttransplant complications.",

Historically, the presence of purulent secretions or numerous white blood cells or bacteria on sputum Gram stain precluded consideration of the donor lung for transplantation.53 A single-center retrospective study by Avlonitis and colleagues54 suggested longer stay in the intensive care unit, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and poorer survival in recipients who received a donor lung with a positive Gram stain. However, several recent studies have suggested that a positive donor Gram stain does not lead to poorer posttransplant outcomes if targeted, aggressive antimicrobial prophylaxis is given initially.45, 55, 56 Weill and colleagues55 reported no difference in the incidence of posttransplant pneumonia at 30 days or duration of mechanical ventilation between recipients of donor lungs with positive or negative Gram stains in patients treated with standard postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis (vancomycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin for 7 days). Currently suggested lung donor acceptability criteria state that a positive Gram stain of the donor tracheal aspirate does not preclude lung donation, but the amount of purulent secretions is of probable, but unproven importance.53\n",

In addition, a literature review comprising studies from 1996 to 1999 found no cases of transplant recipients with CF colonized with Aspergillus before transplant progressing to IA.84 A recent single-center retrospective analysis of mold infections in explanted lungs reported 5% of explants with invasive fungal infections, and pretransplant diagnosis of these infections occurred less than 50% of the time.85 There was an association of unrecognized pretransplant mold infection with invasive fungal infections after transplant, regardless of voriconazole prophylaxis, and attributable mortality was 29% in these patients.85 Earlier studies suggested posttransplant Aspergillus colonization was associated with an 11-fold higher risk of the development of IA,86 but a subsequent single-center series combined with a pooled data analysis from the published literature by Mehrad and colleagues84 suggests that the risk may be substantially lower.

However, the development of rapid, minimally invasive diagnostic testing modalities for aspergillosis remains an area of urgent clinical need. Galactomannan is a polysaccharide cell wall component of Aspergillus, and antigen detection in body fluids can be performed using an enzyme immunoassay technique (Platelia Galactomannan EIA, BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The galactomannan assay has been studied primarily in the hematopoietic stem cell transplant population, in whom it is currently approved for use as a twice-weekly serum-based screening test for the development of IA. Several studies have assessed its usefulness in the diagnosis of IA infection in lung transplant recipients, with mixed results. Prospective testing of serum specimens had poor sensitivity for IA (30%), and did not detect any cases of Aspergillus tracheobronchitis.87 Testing of BAL was more promising, with sensitivities ranging from 60% to 82% and a specificity of 95% in 2 studies.88, 89 False-positive test results can be seen with the use of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (especially piperacillin-tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and amoxicillin), and the test may cross-react in the presence of other molds and endemic fungi. The (1\u21923)-\u03b2-d-glucan assay tests for a cell wall component present in most fungi, thus it is not specific for aspergillosis. The test also has a high false-positive rate in critically ill patients, and does not seem to have better sensitivity than the galactomannan test.90 PCR-based methods for detection of Aspergillus are in development but are not yet standardized for clinical use.91\n",

Other theorized risk factors include early airway ischemia, placement of a bronchial stent, single lung transplantation, hypogammaglobulinemia, CMV infection, use of alemtuzumab or thymoglobulin induction therapies, and acute rejection requiring augmentation of immunosuppression. Both inhaled amphotericin compounds and oral itraconazole and voriconazole prophylaxis strategies have been used, but no randomized controlled trials have assessed these approaches (for a summary of recent study results see Ref.92). A recent single-center, retrospective, sequential study compared universal voriconazole prophylaxis for a minimum of 4 months against 4 months of targeted prophylaxis with itraconazole plus or minus inhaled amphotericin in patients with pretransplant or posttransplant Aspergillus colonization and reported reduced IA in the voriconazole arm.93 However, several recent studies have reported unanticipated adverse events in lung transplant patients given prolonged voriconazole therapy for prophylaxis or treatment of IA, including disabling neuromuscular disorders and periostitis resembling hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.94, 95 Because of the numerous drug interactions of azole antifungals with calcineurin inhibitors and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors, close attention to the dosing of these immunosuppressive agents is imperative.96\n",

In this regard, several species have intrinsic resistance to certain antifungals, such as C krusei resistance to fluconazole, whereas other isolates may have dose-dependent susceptibility, such as C glabrata to fluconazole and C lusitaniae to amphotericin.103 Real-time PCR techniques are in development that may aid in the rapid determination of a specific Candida species from a clinical specimen, but these assays are currently experimental only.91 Suggested treatment of invasive candidal infections has been summarized recently in both the 2009 AST guidelines and the 2009 IDSA guidelines.103, 104 Culture data are essential in all cases to determine the identification of the isolate and subsequent susceptibility information. In nonneutropenic patients with mild to moderate illness, no previous significant azole exposure, and at low risk for C glabrata infection, high-dose fluconazole may be used initially. However, given the increasing use of azole prophylaxis (both fluconazole and voriconazole) in lung transplant patients and their higher risk level for developing severe illness, many experts recommend empiric therapy with an echinocandin or liposomal amphotericin B (depending on renal tolerability). Ongoing treatment should be adjusted based on susceptibility data. The duration of treatment depends on the extent and severity of disease, and ranges from a minimum of 2 weeks after negative blood cultures for uncomplicated candidemia to prolonged courses of treatment with the potential for life-long suppression for endocarditis or similar conditions.",
