Esophageal physiologic testing is among the many clinical procedures that are considered 'non-emergent', since high resolution manometry (HRM), pH and pH-impedance studies are performed for non-life threatening indications. Many physicians, including the authors, are struggling with patients who suffer from refractory undiagnosed gastrointestinal symptoms, who could benefit from esophageal physiologic testing to triage management. How are gastroenterologists managing esophageal symptoms to function under these extra-ordinary circumstances? Clearly, accepted indications for esophageal physiologic testing 2 3 cannot be implemented since guidelines for social distancing impact elective interactions between patients and healthcare providers. In the absence of guidance regarding emergent indications for esophageal physiologic testing in the COVID-19 era, we have developed practical guidelines for triaging patients for safe performance of some of these tests, in settings where management decisions could be expedited to relieve patient symptoms and prevent complications, while simultaneously shortening hospital stay.",

While there is no conclusive evidence that endoscopy and esophageal physiologic testing transmit viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 5 , these procedures are being severely limited out of an abundance of caution in absence of evidence to the contrary. However, some patients with esophageal symptoms may have obstructive motor disease needing urgent management, while others may be regurgitating in the context of severe reflux and pulmonary disease; both are at risk for aspiration. In modern healthcare systems where clinical practice needs exist in a continuum, there is often difficulty in separating what is elective from what is emergent. We have developed a scheme for identifying patients at highest risk for adverse consequences if esophageal physiologic testing is not performed, those that need testing within weeks and cannot wait months, and others that have purely elective indications (Table 1) . These recommendations could be useful in triaging patients during the current lockdown, but will also be useful in prioritizing testing on the backlog of patients once clinical activities resume.",

As the acute crisis resolves and motility laboratories open back up for business, we suggest that emergent/urgent procedures are given priority, followed by semi-urgent procedures, and finally elective procedures. Of course, how and when reopening will occur remains unknown, and must be adapted to the local context. We hope more detailed recommendations will become available in the near future from respective specialty societies to guide practitioners not just during but also following the pandemic. ",
