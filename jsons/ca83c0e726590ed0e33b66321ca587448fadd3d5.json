N protein also has roles in viral replication, transcription, and translation as well as modulating cellular processes. Although coronavirus N proteins have the potential to be phosphorylated at multiple serine residues, mass spectroscopic analysis of both the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) have shown that N protein is phosphorylated at only three or four residues. 1, 2 In the case of IBV N protein, these map to predicted casein kinase II sites. 2 Based on amino acid sequence comparisons, three conserved regions have been identified in the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) N protein. 3 In general, other coronavirus N protein would appear to follow this pattern. Of the three regions, for MHV, region two has been shown to bind both coronavirus and non-coronavirus RNA sequences, whereas regions one and three for IBV N protein have been shown to bind to RNA. 4 We hypothesize that phosphorylation of N protein controls the RNA binding activity and differential phosphorylation of the protein alters its structure to expose necessary binding motif(s). In support of this hypothesis, antibodies studies suggested that phosphorylation of N protein led to substantial conformation change, 5 and using surface plasmon resonance we have recently shown that phosphorylation of IBV N protein was involved in the recognition of viral RNA from nonviral RNA. 2 To investigate this hypothesis, we have developed methodologies to determine whether the overall conformation of N protein changes upon binding viral RNA and what regions may be involved in this process. Our technique is to express either wild-type IBV N protein or its three subregions (termed NI, NII, and NIII) and measure changes in structure upon RNA binding using circular dichroism (CD).

Polypeptides and proteins have regions where the peptide chromophores are in highly ordered arrays; as a consequence, many common secondary structure motifs, such as the \u03b1-helix, \u00df-pleated sheet, \u00df-turn and random coil, have very characteristic CD spectra. 6 CD also allows the detection of gross protein conformational changes; it can therefore be utilized to monitor changes in secondary structure upon ligand binding, multimer formation, and to analyze the protein in a variety of environments. CD was used to analyze structural changes that may occur when IBV N protein binds to models of viral RNA and to map any conformational changes to specific regions of the protein.

Relatively pure (approximately 80%) NII could be produced at lower concentrations (up to 800 \u00b5g/ml) after a two-step chromatography strategy, although some low molecular weight contaminants remained after gel filtration (Fig. 1b) .

The first was RNA synthesized by runoff transcription from pCD-61 (generously provided by Dr. Paul Britton and Dr. Dave Cavanagh) to generate a 6.1-kb analogue of the IBV genome, and the second a synthetic RNAmer that was identical to the 5' end of IBV mRNA 3 up to, and including, the translation initiation codon for gene 3a; both of these targets were used in previous binding studies. 2 Various concentrations of IBV N protein were analyzed in the far UV and averaged. Due to the nature of CD it is difficult to assign definitive structures, however, when delineating the spectrum of IBV N protein the peak between 190 and 200 nm is indicative of \u00df-sheet and the dip at 220 nm can be due to \u03b1-helical secondary structures (Fig. 2) . Other features of the spectrum, including the trough at around 210 nm, are consistent with random coil motifs. Upon the addition of CD61 or leader RNA, subtle changes can be seen in the overall shape of the spectra, in particular the negative signal at 210 nm becomes weaker and a stronger negative trough can be seen between 230 and 250 nm (Fig. 2) .

            "text": "IBV N has a molecular weight of approximately 45 kDa. It is therefore likely that it contains more than one type of secondary structure motif, such as a mixture of \u03b1-helices and \u00df-sheets, or \u00df-sheets involving \u00df-turns, together these motifs generate \"noisy\" spectra. In order to overcome this problem, IBV N was broken down into its three regions, NI, NII, and NIII, and analyzed by CD. The far UV CD-spectrum of NI, the Nterminal region of IBV N protein, can be seen in Fig. 3a . The curve is consistent with a random coil with the major trough at 210 nm. Upon the addition of leader RNA, no change can be seen in the overall shape of the spectrum, indicating that the secondary structure of IBV NI doesn't alter in the presence of viral RNA. NII, the central 15 kDa of IBV N, conversely undergoes a substantial conformational change in the presence of RNA. The far UV CD-spectrum of NII protein in the absence of RNA has a trough at around 215 nm which is indicative of random coil or \u03b1-helical secondary structures. Addition of leader RNA results in changes in the spectrum, namely the strong negative trough at 215 nm is lower in intensity and the peak at 235 nm shifts along nearer to 220 nm; these changes suggest that the protein-RNA complex may contain more \u00df-turns and sheets than that of protein alone (Fig. 3b) . NIII, the C-terminal region of IBV N, was analyzed in the far UV. Due to the nature of this protein and problems with purity, strong CD signals proved difficult to obtain, and the resulting spectrum are therefore less definitive and assigning secondary structure problematic. As can be seen on the NIII spectrum (Fig 3c) , a strong negative signal is obtained upon the addition of viral RNA, indicating that this interaction may stabilize the protein and prevent it from precipitating out of solution. The overall spectrum shows some features consistent with \u00df-sheet motifs, 7 In conclusion, our data would support the hypothesis that N protein undergoes conformational change upon binding viral RNA. These changes would appear to be confined to regions II and III, where RNA binding motifs may be located. Certainly our mass spectroscopic study indicated that regions II and III contained two phosphorylation sites each, whereas region I contained no such sites.",
