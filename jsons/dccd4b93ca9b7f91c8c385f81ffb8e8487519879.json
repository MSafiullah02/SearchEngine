As of 24:00 on February 5th, the National Health Commission has received a total of 28 018 confirmed cases reported. The number of confirmed cases is far more than the total number of confirmed cases of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) worldwide, which indicates that the infectivity of SARSCoV-2 is higher than that of SARS coronavirus. There have been 3859 severe cases, 563 fatal cases, and more than 110 confirmed cases in children.",

            "text": "The disease is still in progress. 3 SARSCoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus that can infect humans and belongs to the \u03b2-coronavirus group. Current research shows that SARSCoV-2 may come from wild animals, but its specific source needs further study. SARSCoV-2 is a new \u03b2-coronavirus, and its gene sequence is most similar to that of viruses isolated from bats, According to the current epidemiological data, the infection rate of SARSCoV-2 to children is low. Studies have demonstrated that SARSCoV-2 has a similar binding receptor and binding properties to SARS-CoV, namely the S protein of coronavirus, which is mainly responsible for binding to the receptor protein of the infected host, enabling the virus to invade and infect host cells. Studies have shown that angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2) is the receptor protein of S protein, which provides evidence for human infection of SARSCoV-2. 9, 10 The study 11 analyzed the mononuclear RNA sequencing data of more than 430 000 human lung cells (non-SARSCoV-2 infection), and found that more than 80% of the ACE2 in the lung was distributed on the surface of type II alveolar epithelial cells (AT2). ACE2 is necessary for SARSCoV-2 to enter into cells and may be one of the receptors of SARSCoV-2. The reason for the low susceptibility of children to SARSCoV-2 may be related to the imperfect development and function of ACE2 protein, or the intracellular response induced by ACE2 in alveolar epithelial cells of children is lower than that of adults. In addition, it may also be related to the imperfect innate immune development of children, and the subsequent low level of adaptive immune response. 5 The symptoms of COVID-2019 in children are mild which may be related to a reduce inflammatory response because the immune system in children is less well developed. Epidemiological studies show that 43 of 99 adults infected with SARSCoV-2 have different degrees of abnormal liver function. Further studies showed that the abnormal liver function of the patients infected with SARSCoV-2 may be caused by bile duct cell dysfunction and other reasons, but not related to the direct damage of hepatocytes. 12, 13 In addition, children are susceptible to a variety of viruses, such as influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, and rhinoviruses. Antibodies produced after infection may cross-react with the coronaviruses to provide some protection. Further studies are needed to confirm whether these manifestations lead to differences in the clinical manifestations of children and adults were infected, whether there are still unexplored mechanisms.",

Close contact with patients with SARSCoV-2 infection and asymptomatic infection is the main way to cause children's infection. It has alsobeen reported that SARSCoV-2 can also be transmitted through aerosols, the fecal-oral route, and suspected mother-to-infant transmission.The incubation period of SARSCoV-2 infection in children is 1 to 14 days, generally 3 to 7 days. The clinical manifestations are asymptomatic or include fever, fatigue, and dry cough; a few patients have upper respiratory tract symptoms, such as nasal obstruction, runny nose, and sore throat; and a few patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, stomachache, and diarrhea.",

(b) Acute upper respiratory tract infection: only fever, cough, pharyngeal pain, nasal obstruction, fatigue, headache, myalgia, or discomfort are observed. There is no pneumonia manifestation on imaging examination or pyemia. (c) Mild pneumonia: with or without fever and accompanied by respiratory symptoms such as cough; chest imaging examination shows pneumonia manifestations but does not reach the threshold of severe pneumonia. (d) Severe pneumonia: any of the following: (i) respiratory rate increase: RR \u2265 70 times/min under 1-year old or RR \u2265 50 times/min over 1-year old, excluding the effects of fever and crying; (ii) oxygen saturation <92%; (iii) manifestations of anoxia: auxiliary respiration (moaning, nasal flaring, and triretraction sign is positive), cyanosis, and intermittent apnea; (iv) disturbance of consciousness: drowsiness, coma, and convulsion; and (v) food refusal or feeding difficulty and dehydration signs. (e) Critically ill children: those who meet one of the following conditions and need ICU monitoring and treatment: (i) respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation; (ii) shock; and (iii) combination with other organ failures. 4 Compared with the clinical characteristics of adult cases, the obvious phase of symptoms lasts for 1 to 2 weeks after the disease, and the detoxification period can lasts for 3 to 4 weeks or longer. The condition of children is obviously milder, recovery faster, and have a better prognosis. 5 We observed that the SARSCoV-2 infection in the two children was characterized by familial aggregation, which further proved that SARSCoV-2 had the characteristics of human-to-human transmission. And the conditions of the two cases were relatively mild, while the six adults who were in close contact with them all had symptoms such as high fever and dyspnea. Case 1 with SARSCoV-2 infection had only mild respiratory tract infection symptoms, the chest CT indicated pulmonary infection, and case 2 had no clinical manifestations of infection. The laboratory examination, including the blood test, CRP, liver, and kidney function and myocardial zymogram, and so forth of the two infected children were not significantly abnormal, which was different from the SARSCoV-2 infection in an adult. In addition to the symptoms of severe respiratory tract infection, most of the adult patients with different degrees of abnormal liver function. At present, there were no obvious manifestations of abnormal liver function among the children infected with infection in domestic reports. 6-8 Among the confirmed cases of the SARS, there were only 135 cases of infection in children, and there were no deaths in children under 12 years old. The MERS caused 2143 people infected and 750fatal cases, while 11 children been confirmed to be infected with MERS, the symptoms were mild. The symptoms of children infected with SARSCoV-2 are mild or even asymptomatic, which may be its characteristic. With the wide application of pathogen detection, whether the number of cases in children will increase needs to be observed with more clinical data.",
