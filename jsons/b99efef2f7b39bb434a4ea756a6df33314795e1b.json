These repeated outbreaks may indicate enhanced viral transmission in the healthcare setting. Better understanding of the viral transmission during an outbreak can potentially improve future preventive measures in similar outbreaks. Our objective in this study was to investigate the transmission pattern of MERS-CoV during the 2015 hospital outbreak in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",

Moreover, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary in-hospital transmissions were reported in the Korean outbreak [9] . A recent risk assessment of MERS-CoV cases from the Korean and Middle East outbreaks estimated the risks of having secondary, tertiary, quaternary, quinary, and beyond quinary hospital transmission at 22.7%, 10.5%, 6.1%, 3.9%, and 2%, respectively [12] . In the current outbreak, tertiary, quaternary, and quinary generations represented 24%, 13%, and 3% of all hospital-acquired transmissions.

Additionally, it is not uncommon that very few community-acquired cases can lead to a major outbreak [1, 14] . Before the outbreak, a seroprevalence study projected that 0.15% of the community in Saudi Arabia has been exposed to the virus [15] . However, due to the lack of accurate and continuous community monitoring [16] , we cannot prove or exclude the presence of a community outbreak at the time of our hospital outbreak.",

Interestingly, the current data show that cases who were infected while in the ED had significantly longer hospital stays and higher mortality outcomes. The role of the ED in spreading healthcare-related MERS-CoV infection has been reported previously [2, 4, 17] . For example, in the largest single hospital cluster in the 2015 Korean MERS-CoV outbreak, 81 (89%) of the 91 HAI cases were infected in the ED [17] . Overcrowded healthcare facilities, particularly EDs, were identified as a major cause for MERS-CoV outbreaks, which by default means poor compliance with infection control practices [4, 7, 18] .",
