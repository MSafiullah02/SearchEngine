            "text": "Acute bronchiolitis is the main cause of hospitalisation in infants and has significant mortality. RSV infection is the major cause of bronchiolitis, accounting for 70\u201380% of cases [1]. RSV bronchiolitis is clearly linked with the later development of wheeze and asthma though its link with later development of atopy is still controversial [2]. An association with the later development of atopic sensitisation has also been reported in studies involving severe bronchiolitis. No association has been observed in less severe bronchiolitis. The mechanisms underlying the association between RSV bronchiolitis and the later development of wheezing are incompletely understood, though there is increasing evidence that impaired antiviral immunity is likely to play an important role in increasing susceptibility to virus infections early in life, as well as perhaps the later development of asthma [3]. Whether RSV bronchiolitis plays a causal role in increasing the risk of asthma development is a subject of great interest though clear evidence for a causal role has not yet been established. We need to understand the mechanisms of association of bronchiolitis with later wheezing and asthma in the hope that we will be able to define potential avenues for development of new therapies.",

However, the epidemiological evidence linking other viruses with later development of wheeze and asthma is less extensive than the literature on RSV. This may be because RSV has a particular tropism for the lower respiratory tract and perhaps other special features such as the ability to induce TH2 biased inflammation or to induce long\u2010lasting changes in local immune responses. However, it may also be a result of relatively poor diagnostic methods for the other virus types and a lack of appreciation of the importance of these viruses resulting in studies not being carried out as frequently or effectively with these viruses as with RSV. There is clearly an urgent need for studies specifically investigating the role of upper and lower respiratory tract virus infections in this context.",

The role of genetic variation in the host immune response as a determinant of disease severity and of HLA subtype also needs to be determined. The importance of specific cytokines and chemokines in inflammatory responses to virus infection requires investigating as specific antagonists are available for some and in development for others and there is good potential for intervention if individual cytokines or chemokines can be demonstrated as being important in disease pathogenesis. Developing and testing safe and effective antiviral therapies and vaccines against RSV remains an urgent priority. To achieve this will require in vitro models, in vivo animal models and human experimental challenge models. The role of RSV in impairment of lung growth in infancy and in the initiation of airway remodelling responses should be studied.
