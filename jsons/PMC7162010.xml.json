            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a positive sense, single\u2010stranded RNA virus coated with viral particles (Fehr & Perlman, 2015). Together with Arteriviridae and Roniviridae, CoVs belong to the Coronaviridae family in the order Nidovirales. These CoVs can infect a wide variety of hosts, including avian, swine and humans. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) represent a major group of CoVs associated with various respiratory diseases from common cold to serious pneumonia and bronchitis (Mesel\u2010Lemoine et al., 2012). Today, HCoVs are recognized as one of the most rapidly evolving viruses originated from their characteristic high genomic nucleotide substitution rates and recombination. In human, their infection is known to cause approximately one\u2010third of common cold. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoVs are highly pathogenic and caused a fatal first major outbreak in 2003 and 2012, respectively (de Wit, Doremalen, Falzarano, & Munster, 2016). SARS\u2010 and MERS\u2010CoVs genomes contain two open reading frames ORF1a and ORF1b translated to two respective viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab by host ribosomes. ORF1a encodes two cysteine proteases, a papain\u2010like protease (PLpro) and a 3C\u2010like protease (3CLpro). While PLpro cuts the first three cleavage sites of its polyprotein, 3CLpro is responsible for cleavage of the remaining eleven locations resulting in release of a total of 16 non\u2010structural proteins (nsp) in both SARS\u2010 and MERS\u2010CoVs. The homodimeric form of 3CLpro is active in the presence of substrates. The crystal structure of 3CLpro showed that each monomer is composed of three structural domains: domains I and II form a chymotrypsin\u2010like architecture with catalytic cysteine and are connected to a third C\u2010terminal domain via a long loop (Neddle, Lountos, & Waugh, 2015). In the proteolytic site, all 3CLpros prefer glutamine at P1 position and leucine, basic residues, small hydrophobic residues at P2, P3 and P4 positions, respectively (Chuck, Chow, Wan, & Wong, 2011). At P1\u2032 and P2\u2032 positions, small residues are required. Since the autocleavage process is essential for viral propagation, 3CLpro is a good drug target for anti\u2010coronaviral infection. In this study, we used a proteolytic method to probe MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro inhibitory compounds with a synthetic peptide labelled with the EDANS\u2010DABCYL FRET (Fluorescence resonance energy transfer) pair (Liu et al., 2005). Since emission wavelengths of EDANS are widely overlapped with absorbance wavelengths of DABCYL, the energy emitted from EDANS will be quenched by DABCYL in a close proximity (10\u2013100 \u00c5). Therefore, an increment of fluorescence can be a sign to judge whether a substrate is cleaved or not in this design. Hence from the fluorescence intensity change, the proteolytic activity of protease could be detected. With a synthetic peptide with the FRET pair, a flavonoid library was screened to search MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro inhibitory compounds. Recent studies showed that some flavonoids have antiviral activity in some viruses (Frabasile et al., 2017; Juc\u00e1 et al.,2018; Kiat et al., 2006; Yang, Lin, Zhou, Liu, & Zhu, 2017; Zakaryan, Arabyan, Oo, & Zandi, 2017). Therefore, we assayed flavonoids and tried to induce their structural property crucial to bind with MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro.",

NC_019843.3) was synthesized chemically by Bioneer and cloned into a bacteriophage T7\u2010based expression vector. The plasmid DNA was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were grown on Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 150 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin. Several colonies were picked and grown in capped test\u2010tubes with 10 ml LB broth containing 150 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin. A cell stock composed of 0.85 ml culture and 0.15 ml glycerol was prepared and frozen at 193 K for use in a large culture. The frozen cell stock was grown in 5 ml LB medium and diluted into 2,000 ml fresh LB medium. The culture was incubated at 310 K with shaking until an OD600 of 0.6\u20130.8 was reached. At this point, expression of MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro was induced using isopropyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010d\u20101\u2010thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 1 mM.

This substrate contains the nsp4/nsp5 cleavage sequence, GVLQ\u2193SG (Wua et al., 2015), and works as a generic peptide substrate for many coronavirus including MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro. The peptide was dissolved in distilled water and incubated with each protease. A SpectraMax i3x Multi\u2010mode microplate reader (Molecular Devices) was used to measure spectral\u2010based fluorescence. The proteolytic activity was determined at 310 K by following the increase in fluorescence (\u03bbexcitation = 340 nm, \u03bbemission = 490 nm, bandwidths = 9, 15 nm, respectively) of EDANS upon peptide hydrolysis as a function of time. Assays were conducted in black, 96\u2010well plates (Nunc) in 350 \u03bcl assay buffers containing protease and substrate as follows: for the MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro assay, 1.84 \u03bcl of 0.19 mM protease containing 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 was incubated with 8.75 \u03bcl of 0.1 mM substrate at 310 K for 2 hr before measuring Relative Fluorescence Unit (RFU). Before the assay, the emission spectra of 40 flavonoids were surveyed after illuminating at 340 nm to avoid the overlapping with the emission spectrum of EDANS. Every compound was suitable to be tested. The final concentration of the protease, peptide and chemical used at the assay was 1, 2.5 and 20 \u03bcM each. At first, MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro and chemical were mixed and preincubated at room temperature for 1 hr. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the substrate, and each well was incubated at 310 K for 2 hr. After 2 hr, we measured the fluorescence of the mixture on the black 96\u2010well plate using the end\u2010point mode of SpectraMax i3x where the excitation wavelength was fixed to 340 nm and the emission wavelength was set to 490 nm using 9, 15 nm bandwidth, respectively. All reactions were carried out in triplicate. Among the first forty flavonoids (Table S1), four of them were picked up to further assay at a concentration range of 2 \u03bcM\u2013320 \u03bcM. IC50 value which is the value causing 50% inhibition of catalytic activity of MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro was calculated by non\u2010linear regression analysis using graphpad prism 7.03 (GraphPad Software).",

Naringenin has therapeutic effects on various neurological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, rheumatological, metabolic and malignant disorders (Rani et al., 2016). It also represents antiviral function (Zakaryan et al., 2017). Fisetin is a commercially available nutraceutical with anti\u2010inflammatory, antioxidant, anti\u2010tumorigenic, anti\u2010invasive, anti\u2010angiogenic, anti\u2010diabetic, neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects (Pal, Pearlman, & Afaq, 2016). Interestingly, fisetin has an anti\u2010noroviral activity by inducing cytokines (Seo & Choi, 2017). Although some of flavonoids show an antiviral effect, a molecular mechanism of their antiviral activity was rarely known.",

For the trial, a flavonoid library composed of nine different scaffolds plus one undefined group was constructed. They are classified based on a C6\u2010C3\u2010C6 skeleton and differ in the overall hydroxylation patterns and in the saturation of the heteroatomic ring C together with the position of the attached aromatic ring B (at the positions C\u20102 or C\u20103 of ring C) (Juc\u00e1 et al., 2018). The flavonoid library was tested, and thus, a systematic analysis was possible. Among the ten groups, isoflavones, isoflavane, flavanols and flavanones did not show any inhibitory activity over MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro. The other groups contains some flavonoids displaying moderate inhibitory activity. However, four flavonoids, herbacetin, isobavachalcone, quercetin 3\u2010\u03b2\u2010d\u2010glucoside and helichrysetin exhibited prominent inhibitory activity. The immediate inference of the primary scaffold required for binding with MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro was as follows: first, the orientation of the aromatic ring B at the position C\u20102 of ring C is essential as shown in isoflavones and isoflavane. Second, the saturated heteroatomic ring C is not preferred as shown in flavanols and flavanones. Third, chalcone and flavonol scaffolds show a promising binding property.",

Helichrysetin is a chalcone derivative (Van Puyvelde et al., 1989). Therefore, we compared its inhibitory activity with a chalcone, cardamonin (2\u2032,4\u2032\u2010dihydroxy\u20106\u2032\u2010methoxychalcone) which is the structurally identical homologue except one hydroxyl group at the 4\u2010position of the benzyl moiety of chalcone. The inhibitory activity of cardamonin at the concentration of 40 \u03bcM was lower than that of helichrysetin (Figure 4). It implies that the 4\u2010hydroxyl group of helichrysetin is functionally important to bind with MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro. The structural comparison of cardamonin with isobavachalcone also indicated the modification effect of acetophenone ring of chalcone: the hydrophobic modification at the 3\u2032\u2010position of the acetophenone ring moiety of isobavachalcone improves its binding affinity to MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro. Intriguingly, the docking study shows that the 4\u2010hydroxyl group of helichrysetin forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Tyr54 of MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro. Since Tyr54 is located deep inside of the hydrophobic S2 site, helichrysetin is inserted into deeper than cardamonin (Figure S3a). As a result, helichrysetin seems to have a better affinity and thus represents a better inhibitory activity.",

The docking study indicates kaempferol derivatives occupy the S1 and S2 sites of MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro (Figure S3b). The hydroxyl group at 7\u2010position looks important to bind at the S1 binding site. A bit better inhibitory activity of herbacetin indicates the hydroxide at 8\u2010position is favourable for its binding affinity to MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro. In the predicted complex, the hydroxyl group at 8\u2010position of herbacetin induces a hydrogen bond with His41 at the S1 site.",

Recently, the non\u2010competitive inhibition of cardamonin against the dengue virus protease has been reported (Kiat et al., 2006). As discussed above, cardamonin is a strong homologue of helichrysetin. The analysis of the crystal structures of three viral proteases, MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro, dengue virus NS2B/NS3 protease and norovirus 3CLpro were performed, and their active sites were compared (Figure S4) (Erbel et al., 2006; Nakamura et al., 2005). Despite their sequential divergence, their overall architecture resembles each other. Furthermore, the spatial positions of their catalytic residues were also highly conserved. The observation implies that chalcone and flavonol can be used as templates to develop a potential antiviral agent by targeting these viral proteases.",

The assay in the presence of Triton X\u2010100 also eliminated the chance of the false\u2010positive result from the aggregation of flavonoids. The analysis of the four compounds with their homologs using an induced\u2010fit docking study provided an insight of flavonoid scaffolds required to bind with MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro. The prominent activity of helichrysetin and isobavachalcone indicates that the flexibility of the chalcone scaffold is good to bind with MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro. In contrast, the comparable activity of flavones with a rigid \u03b3\u2010pyrone ring indicates that their spatial rearrangement together with various functional groups may be an alternative strategy to interact with MERS\u2010CoV 3CLpro.
