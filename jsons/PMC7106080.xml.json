The family consists of the two classic genera: Marburgvirus, discovered in 1967 (Siegert et al., 1967), comprised of various strains of the Lake Victoria marburgvirus including Marburg virus and Ravn virus, and the antigenically distinct genus Ebolavirus discovered in 1976 (Emond et al., 1977), comprised of five species partially including Sudan ebolavirus, Zaire ebolavirus, Ivory Coast ebolavirus also known as Cote d\u2019Ivoire Ebolavirus or the Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus, and the Reston ebolavirus (Towner et al., 2008). The fifth and most recent member of the Ebolavirus genus is the Bundibugyo ebolavirus identified in an outbreak of human disease in Uganda, Africa. In addition, a tentative, third genus of Filoviridae has been recently identified in Spain, in bats, with formal publication of the discovery and full genome characterization anticipated (Kuhn et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Filovirus genomes are comprised of linear, non-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA approximately 19 kb in length (Regnery et al., 1980) (Fig. 1\n). The gene organization consists of a conserved 3\u2032 non-coding region followed by seven genes that encode structural proteins and concluding in a conserved 5\u2032 non-coding region (Fig. 1). In addition, the viral genes are flanked by extragenic regions containing promoters for transcription and replication (Feldmann et al., 1992) (Fig. 1). The nucleoprotein (NP), viral proteins VP35 and VP30 and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or L protein are bound to the viral genome, mediate transcription and replication and together form the nucleocapsid of the virus particle (Muhlberger, 2007). Another viral protein, VP40, serves as a matrix protein and plays a role in virus budding and release from the host cell (Urata et al., 2007). Virus protein VP24 represents yet another matrix protein and is involved in nucleocapsid formation and assembly (Noda et al., 2007). The seventh protein encoded by the virus is the envelope surface glycoprotein or spike glycoprotein (GP), which mediates attachment and entry into target cells and represents a major determinant of virus pathogenicity (Licata et al., 2004). A notable difference between Ebola and Marburg viruses is the use of mRNA editing in the expression of full length GP by Ebola viruses, but not Marburg viruses. As a result of RNA editing in Ebola viruses, two forms of envelope protein are expressed, the more abundant being a smaller soluble protein (sGP) and the less abundant being the full length GP (Fig. 1). The sGP has been shown to have antagonistic effects on TNF-\u03b1 induced endothelial barrier functions (Falzarano et al., 2006, Sanchez et al., 1996, Volchkov et al., 1995, Wahl-Jensen et al., 2005). Regarding the full length GP, there is a strong correlation between the level of GP expression and severe vascular cell cytotoxicity that is characteristic of filovirus infections. In vitro, the mucin domain of GP itself has been found to elicit cytotoxicity of endothelial cells (Yang et al., 2000). In addition, high level expression of full-length GP on host cell surfaces has been shown to not only mask particular immune-reactive epitopes of the GP but also cause the down regulation of host cell surface immune surveillance markers including major histocompatibility complex class I molecules resulting in immune evasion (Reynard et al., 2009). Among the viral proteins, VP35 and VP24 are known to be involved in interference of host cellular antiviral interferon mechanisms by prevention of nuclear accumulation of the phosphorylated signal transduction and transcription activation element, STAT1(Basler et al., 2003, Reid et al., 2006, Valmas et al., 2010). In addition the VP40 of Marburg virus has been shown to inhibit interferon mediated antiviral mechanisms in a manner that is distinct from Ebola viruses through interference with the phosphorylation event of STAT1 and STAT2 and also has effects on Janus kinase dependent interferon pathways (Valmas et al., 2010).",

Likewise, the genus Ebolavirus, comprised currently of multiple isolates of five representative species, would be similarly written and abbreviated to discriminate the genus, species, and individual virus isolate names (Table 1) (Kuhn et al., 2010). As a result of the recent genome characterization of a novel filovirus, Lloviu virus (LLOV), equidistantly related to Marburg and Ebola viruses and discovered in Schreiber\u2019s long-fingered bats (Miniopterus schreibersii) in the Cueva del Lloviu Principality of Asturias in Spain, a new genus within Filoviridae, Cuevavirus, has been proposed (Kuhn et al., 2010).",

While pathogenesis seems largely limited to humans and non-human primates, a few other animal species including swine have been found to be susceptible to infection by Ebola viruses (Barrette et al., 2009). Trace RT-PCR evidence and/or serological evidence suggest the potential susceptibility of duiker antelope to infection (Gonzalez et al., 2007, Rouquet et al., 2005). Candidate reservoir hosts for filoviruses are thought to be mammals of small body size, asymptomatic, and not likely to be companion animals (Peterson et al., 2004). Investigations into potential host species have also recently identified African fruit bats as possible reservoirs for Zaire ebolavirus (Leroy et al., 2005, Swanepoel et al., 1996) and Marburg virus (Swanepoel et al., 2007, Towner et al., 2007).",

Subsequent human to human transmission of Ebola virus has similarly been linked to close contact between immediate family members (Leroy et al., 2009, Walsh et al., 2005). Likewise Marburg virus outbreaks have been occasionally attributed to direct contact with infected mammalian tissues (Swanepoel et al., 2007). There have also been examples of human acquired infections of Marburg virus, upon entering caves where bats harboring the virus are known to reside. The route of infection for these cases is presumed to be through exposure to aerosol or bat excreta within the cave. (Anon, 2009, Swanepoel et al., 2007, Timen et al., 2009, Towner et al., 2009).",

The discovery of Reston virus in domestic swine had broad implications not only for our understanding of the potential host range of filoviruses and the newly recognized risk of their spread to food producing animals, but also to the greater prevalence and circulation of Ebola virus as directly inferred from the genetic diversity of the co-circulating viruses from swine as compared to the historical Reston virus isolates from monkeys (Barrette et al., 2009).",

Similar to the complete genome, the phylogenetic relationship of VP35 displays an ancestral node for TAFV and BDBV that has an ancestral relationship that is closest to the Zaire ebolavirus (Fig. 3\n). While TAFV and BDBV group closely together in both analyses (Fig. 2, Fig. 3), their respective branch lengths as determined by the DNA Distance algorithm on the full length genome analysis clearly demonstrates the divergence of these two viruses leading to the classification of BDBV as a new distinct species (Fig. 2) (Towner et al., 2008). This distinction is less clearly defined in the more limited analysis of the VP35 gene (Fig. 3), highlighting the importance of full genome or multi-gene analyses in inferring phylogenetic relationships.",

These findings are particularly remarkable considering that most RNA viruses do not replicate their genomes in the host cell nucleus. In this regard, it is believed that co-expression of an endogenous or exogenous retrovirus might have led to the generation of cDNA from a co-infecting RNA virus in turn resulting in the integration of viral cDNA sequences into the genome of a host germ cell. For instance a genome integration of VP35 in Tarsier and microbat genomes appears to have originated from a common ancestor with the Ebolavirus genus (Fig. 3) (Belyi et al. 2010). In addition to integrations of viral VP35 sequences in the genomes of the tarsier, wallaby, and microbat, the NP gene has integrated into the guinea pig, microbat, shrew, opossum, and wallaby genomes, and an L gene remnant has been found in the opossum genome (Belyi et al. 2010). A large number of stop codons and gaps observed in the wallaby gene insertion may indicate an earlier integration event than observed in the tarsier and microbat. Similar integrations of genes from other positive or negative sense RNA viruses, likely facilitated by reverse transcription of endogenous or co-infecting retroviruses, have also been recently identified (Horie et al., 1990, Taylor et al., 2010). Based on the analysis of these paleoviral elements, found to be integrated, it is estimated that the association event with filovirus and their mammalian hosts occurred tens of millions of years prior to previous estimates (Taylor et al., 2010) In this regard a better understanding of why some species harbor integrated filovirus derived genes others do not, may one day have predictive value for identifying reservoir host species (Taylor et al. 2010). Transcription has also been identified from some of the integrated genes increasing the potential for evolutionary influence on the host.",

Initially, it was believed that the emergence of variants of Ebola virus was largely monophyletic, originating from a single event and diverging in a wave front distributed over time. However with the evidence of viral genome stability within an individual outbreak (Rouquet et al., 2005) coupled with the observation of multiple strains of Zaire ebolavirus occurring in a single outbreak, as seen in the Gabon/Republic of Congo outbreak in 2001 with up to 2\u20133% variation (Wittmann et al., 2007), it seems likely that some outbreaks may have more diverse origins than originally thought. Similarly, a pattern of multiple, parallel introductions of Reston virus in swine in the Philippines in 2008 (Barrette et al., 2009) lends credence to the observation that multiple individual introductions of unique viruses originating from a viral reservoir may be an integral part of the viral transmission cycle (Wittmann et al., 2007). This may occur as low pathogenic viruses may circulate undetected through the host population. This may be the outcome of a pool of divergent strains, which may indicate where the host and virus have co-evolved as to allow for viral propagation, with minimal pathogenicity. What is less clear is the mechanism by which the virus is able to emerge from a reservoir pool and cause disease in novel host species.",

Additionally, there may be some incidents of coinfection which may be able to facilitate virus entry or persistence in different hosts. Fruit bat species Rousettus aegyptiacus, (Towner et al., 2009) and Hypsignathus monstrosus (Laminger and Prinz, 2010) in Africa, considered as likely reservoir hosts for Marburg and Ebola viruses respectively, have been shown to be seropositive for antibodies against the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Muller et al., 2007). Likewise, within the insectivorous bats a single species, Miniopterus inflatus has been identified as a potential Ebola virus reservoir (Leroy et al., 2009) and has similarly been found to be seropositive for antibodies against the SARS-CoV (Muller et al., 2007). Coincidentally, both Ebola virus and SARS-CoV share a similarity upon virus entry as both are dependent upon cathepsin-L cleavage in the endosomal compartment of the host cell (Schornberg et al., 2006, Simmons et al., 2005). It is intriguing to speculate about how similar mechanisms of virus infectivity between the two viruses may affect host susceptibility to infection, disease, and/or synergistic or competing co-infection between the reservoir and new host.",

Despite the historical evidence of a co-infection, in Cynomolgus macaques, it has been demonstrated that the Reston virus alone is sufficient to cause fatal illness (Jahrling et al., 1996). Pathogenicity of Reston virus is less clear in pigs, where Reston virus was found in diseased lung tissue of pigs, likely contributing to disease, but was also only found in co-infection with the PRRSV suggesting that Reston virus alone may not be sufficient to manifest serious clinical signs in pigs (Barrette et al., 2009).",

Along with the recent discoveries highlighted in this review, an increased interest in surveillance for emerging diseases and an increased use of high throughput next generation sequencing will continue to uncover new filovirus members and potential host reservoirs at an ever increasing rate. Such discoveries that enhance our understanding of the phylogeny of filoviruses coupled to interdisciplinary approaches to the study of emerging infectious diseases at the human, animal, plant and environmental interfaces will no doubt be essential to elucidating new reservoir hosts and potential risk factors for transmission of filovirus infections to humans and livestock.",
