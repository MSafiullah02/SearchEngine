Given this event is truly a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic (World Health Organization, 2020), most individuals will view the event as extremely negative in valence, unpredictable, largely outside their own ability to control it, and relatively extraordinary in nature, insofar that it is unlike any past events they have experienced. All of these factors will likely play a contributing role with respect to several mental health concerns. In addition, the potential for derailment to prove a lingering concern arises from the fact that the pandemic, and our response to it, has been an emotionally significant challenge for several individuals, and one that may have impacted their lives, worldviews, and social statuses. Indeed, if one believes that the world has changed in fundamental ways, it would be difficult to perceive one's own life as having continuity in the same direction as before the event. Moreover, shifting social ties may lead individuals to reset their motivations, or at least question the ambitions they once held. With calls for continued self-isolation and social distancing, several individuals are at risk for disconnection from their past selves and motives, and left questioning whether their lives will be continuously discontinuous as a result.",

Items from the Derailment Scale (Burrow et al., 2020) reflect how many people have felt during recent weeks and months. For instance, most people have probably noticed \"how different (they) are now from who (they) used to be,\" or even are starting to doubt that their lives have \"been heading in the same direction for a long time.\" In addition, several people may no longer feel that their \"motivations in life have been the same over time,\" as they are more focused now on resolving basic needs or completing work-related tasks remotely.",

Moreover, it is important to note that some symptoms of derailment may be treated even with limited resources. Though more malignant forms likely require one-on-one therapy, similar to identity disorders, research has shown that journaling activities at home at least can temporarily help individuals reduce their derailment symptoms (Burrow et al., 2020) . Given the clear challenges faced by mental health professionals due to the widespread impact of this pandemic, and ongoing public health policies that limit social interaction, derailment may be uniquely positioned as a construct both of great significance for clinicians, and one that may be intervened upon in part without significant inperson care.
