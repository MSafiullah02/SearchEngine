The United States of America Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta proposes a 10-steps process in outbreak investigation that is adaptable to circumstances, resources available or suspected cause.1, 2, 3 The application of such a systematic approach allows in defining the outbreak, identifying the risk factors and application of interventions, that could alter the risk of transmission post-assessment. There exists a logical sequence in the 10-steps followed during an outbreak investigation but in some situations, these steps may occur simultaneously.4\n",

According to a recent review of IDSP (2015), the issues still needing attention were that of poor quality surveillance and reporting, limited specimen testing in outbreaks and low laboratory standards18; lack of useful data and data analytics; non-functional surveillance committees, a higher priority to disease of other vertical programmes; no defined core competencies for staff, high vacancies, contractual post and lacunae in the fund release18 We presume that combination of such identified issues could have contributed to the gaps that were observed in the systematic approach to outbreak investigations in India.6, 7, 8\n,\n10\n",

Previous studies recognize lack of reporting of the actual procedures followed in outbreak investigation by the investigating teams.10, 12, 24 In order to improve better reporting practices of outbreak investigations in published literature, a 22 item checklist - \u201cOutbreak Response and Intervention studies of Nosocomial Infection\u201d (ORION) was developed in 2007 by Stone SP et al.21 A follow-up review close to a decade after the ORION guidelines were framed, reported a failure in the completion of reports as per these guidelines.22 Our study has followed the 10- steps approach since both international and national agencies have advocated the need to stringently follow these ten steps while conducting an outbreak investigation. Nevertheless, it is possible that the authors might have overlooked reporting of these steps based on the journal's target audience and word count limitations of the journal. However, by using this review tool, we would also like to draw attention to the need for guidelines while reporting such field-based investigations. Hence, only through mandatory compliance with guidelines while publishing an outbreak investigation, we can improve the quality of reporting of available information. Reporting the steps holds importance in ensuring that a systematic methodology and transparency are followed and clarifies any concerns raised by the audience in the conduct of an outbreak investigation.",

We could have under-estimated the actual use of systematic outbreak investigation methodology in the field. However, actual use may be difficult to arrive at and hence, we did consult grey literature to partially overcome this limitation. On the other hand, we could have over-estimated the use of completion of 10-steps in the published outbreaks due to publication bias associated with such investigations. This limitation is difficult to avoid and our estimates are available by investigating agencies that allows us to interpret accordingly. It may be possible that public health trainees (such as FETP) may tend to accurately report the systematic methodology due to the academic rigor and expectations. However, our primary interest was in estimating proportion of published outbreak reports following 10-steps irrespective of the author profile. Despite these limitations, our findings do provide important information on existing gaps that require immediate attention from surveillance and outbreak response authorities, investigating agencies and may be publishing houses.18 Additionally, we also conducted critical appraisal of the study designs using a modified JBI checklist to estimate the quality of the reporting.",
