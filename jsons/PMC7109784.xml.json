            "text": "Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS with both genetic and environmental components. While immunopathogenic mechanisms appear to be important in multiple sclerosis, the trigger or triggers responsible for initiating and perpetuating the immune reaction remain undetermined. A viral trigger involved in multiple sclerosis was suggested >100 years ago (Marie, 1884), and an extensive list of candidate viruses has emerged since then. Early investigations examined differences in viral antibody titres between multiple sclerosis and normal control patients. The predominant viruses with putative positive connections were measles, mumps, varicella-zoster, Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), parainfluenza and canine distemper virus (Reed et al., 1964; Millar et al., 1971; Lehrich et al., 1974; Ito et al., 1975; Sumaya et al., 1976; Cook et al., 1979). For every implicated virus, there were also papers whose antibody titre results refuted a connection (Woyciechowska et al., 1977; Poskanzer et al., 1980; Stephenson et al., 1980). Advances in molecular biology have allowed sensitive techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH) to identify viral nucleic acids in multiple sclerosis tissue samples. These advances have increased the number of candidate viruses to include endogenous retroviruses, coronaviruses, several new human herpesviruses and the bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae (Murray et al., 1992; Wilborn et al., 1994; Challoner et al., 1995; Sanders et al., 1996). In spite of the new techniques, most implicated viruses sport numerous papers that refute a connection with multiple sclerosis in almost equal proportion to those that show an association (Godec et al., 1992; Hilton et al., 1994; Martin et al., 1997; Merelli et al., 1997; Tsai and Gilden, 2001; Tuke et al., 2004). No single virus so far has been successfully linked to multiple sclerosis initiation and/or exacerbation, although recent successes in identifying infectious agents involved in other chronic diseases have raised fresh hopes that the agent(s) involved in multiple sclerosis will be identified (Zimmer, 2001).",

            "text": "There has been much recent interest in a member of the herpesvirus family, human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6). HHV-6 was first isolated from AIDS patients (Salahuddin et al., 1986). It is a \u03b2-herpesvirus that comes in two distinct variants (A and B) (Ablashi et al., 1991; Schirmer et al., 1991) and has a linear double-stranded DNA genome of 160 kb (Gompels et al., 1995). The virus has a high seroprevalence, with most becoming infected by the age of 2 years (Okuno et al., 1989; Levy et al., 1990), and is associated with the common childhood infection exanthem subitum (Yamanishi et al., 1988). After initial infection, HHV-6 can remain in the host in a latent state, with reactivation being a particular problem after transplant surgery (Singh and Carrigan, 1996). In vitro studies have demonstrated that HHV-6 can infect neural cells (Albright et al., 1998), and primary infection with HHV-6 can cause CNS complications such as encephalitis (Yoshikawa and Asano, 2000). In addition, in vitro infection of immature dendritic cells induces functional and phenotypic alterations, suggesting an ability to affect immune function (Kakimoto et al., 2002). There is also evidence to suggest that HHV-6 infection may result in oligodendrocyte cell death (Kong et al., 2003) or a decrease in cell proliferation rate (Dietrich et al., 2004), and could initiate demyelination as the virus encodes a protein capable of generating cross-reactivity with myelin basic protein (Cirone et al., 2002; Tejada-Simon et al., 2003). The combination of all of these studies enhances the viral hypothesis and makes HHV-6 a credible virus for involvement in multiple sclerosis. The presence of HHV-6 in patient lesions was first demonstrated by Challoner et al. (1995) by PCR of DNA extracted from the lesions and immunocytochemistry (ICC) on lesion sections for viral proteins, findings that were largely confirmed by others (Friedman et al., 1999). Subsequent studies have demonstrated the presence of the HHV-6 genome in oligodendrocytes, lymphocytes and microglia of lesional tissues by performing in situ PCRs (ISPCRs) (Blumberg et al., 2000; Goodman et al., 2003). In most studies, HHV-6 has been found in normal control samples, and is frequently absent in some of the multiple sclerosis samples (Moore and Wolfson, 2002; Tyler, 2003). This is especially apparent in the majority of studies that only examine sera and/or CSF (Ablashi et al., 1998, 2000; Akhyani et al., 2000; Soldan et al., 2000; Tomsone et al., 2001; Alvarez-Lafuente et al., 2002a,b; Caselli et al., 2002; Tejada-Simon et al., 2002; Cermelli et al., 2003; Chapenko et al., 2003). This is also the case for studies where it is concluded that HHV-6 does not play a role in multiple sclerosis (Hay and Tenser, 2000; Taus et al., 2000; Al-Shammari et al., 2003).",

            "text": "As no studies to date have examined evidence of active viral infection through detection of RNA either in situ or in extracted nucleic acids, we reasoned that this could be important in identifying a possible connection between HHV-6 and multiple sclerosis. Experiments were therefore designed which examined expression of both an immediate early (IE) gene (U94) responsible for maintenance of latency (Yoshikawa et al., 2002) and a late gene (expression of which indicates active viral infection). We have utilized mRNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and PCR/reverse transcription (RT)\u2013PCR, in our search for latency-associated U94 and late gene U58 expression. By comparing normal control tissue with multiple sclerosis normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and lesional tissues, we hoped to establish whether there were any differences in viral activity between these three tissue types.",

A further 45 rounds of amplification failed to improve matters, prompting the adoption of the nested PCR approach. As nested PCRs carry a higher risk of a false-positive signal, Southern blots were performed to validate the results. Southern blot of nested PCRs show positive samples for multiple sclerosis tissues for all genomic DNA samples and many of the cDNAs from mRNA (Fig. 4C and D). RT\u2013PCR was also performed on the samples for the endogenous oligodendrocyte gene claudin-11 and the housekeeping gene \u03b2-microglobulin (see Fig. 4A and B). Although equal amounts of mRNA were used, the level of claudin-11 expression is obviously variable between the different samples, whereas the housekeeping gene remains relatively uniform (see Fig. 4A and B). This suggests that the actual number of oligodendrocytes varies between the samples. \n",

            "text": "We have shown here that HHV-6 mRNA expression is found in both normal control and multiple sclerosis brain samples, with activity confined to oligodendrocytes. The difference between normal control samples and multiple sclerosis tissue is quantitative rather than qualitative, with control normal tissue exhibiting much lower levels of viral activity (our highest level being \u223c12% of all oligodendrocytes surveyed, with the average level at \u223c4\u20135%). Both NAWM and lesional multiple sclerosis tissue samples exhibited in general much higher levels of viral gene expression, with some examples of close to 100% of oligodendrocytes exhibiting active viral gene expression. Statistical analysis confirmed that the differences between the tissues were significant. The mRNA FISH results were confirmed with both immunofluorescence against viral proteins and RT\u2013PCR. Although the presence of viral proteins indicates an active infection (from both A and B subspecies), we cannot exclude the remote possibility that there could be a post-translational block and consequent absence of virus particle production. While some individual NAWM and lesional samples had HHV-6-positive oligodendrocytes within the normal range, most had much higher levels. These results suggest that NAWM may not be \u2018normal\u2019 in multiple sclerosis patients, a notion which has been suggested previously (Peters et al., 1995). The lesional samples that exhibited lower levels of HHV-6 infection may be inactive lesions, with high levels of viral load seen only in active lesions and pre-lesional NAWM. Alternatively, it is possible that higher levels of activity are only seen immediately preceding and/or during a clinical episode. Reactivation of HHV-6 from a latent state due to an exogenous viral infection/inflammatory response is another plausible hypothesis that could explain the differences in HHV-6-positive oligodendrocytes. It is also possible that HHV-6 plays a role in multiple sclerosis pathogenesis in only a subset of patients, with other environmental agents acting in other cases (possibly another herpesvirus such as the related HHV-7 or EBV). Even if viral gene products are significantly upregulated in multiple sclerosis, the question inevitably arises as to whether this is an epiphenomenon secondary to underlying disease processes or a primary event in disease pathogenesis. Differentiation of these two scenarios is problematic and relies mainly on the interpretation of multiple relevant data. Comparing and interpreting results from different research groups is in itself difficult as a wide variety of techniques are used and there is not even a commonly adopted primer set for PCR verification of the HHV-6 genome (Enbom, 2001; Moore and Woolfson, 2002; Clark, 2004). In addition, few, if any, groups have access to the number of patient samples and controls necessary to establish a strong link between multiple sclerosis and a given candidate virus. There is also the potential pitfall that with low numbers, what appears to be a trend may only be the result of random sampling, and the problem of low patient sample numbers is also problematic.",

            "text": "The novel features of this study are the use of both IE and late gene probes to detect HHV-6 mRNA in white matter samples, and the use of fluorescent double labelling of two different RNA species to visualize co-localization of HHV-6 gene expression and oligodendrocytes. The detection of late gene mRNA and protein in addition to IE gene expression and translation confirmed the presence of an active infection in all the sample groups studied. The absence of any qualitative differences necessitated the adoption of a quantitative evaluation of viral activity in the samples. Multiple sclerosis samples had a predominantly higher proportion of their oligodendrocyte cells undergoing active HHV-6 infection compared with normal control levels, with lesional samples exhibiting generally higher levels of infection than NAWM. It was also interesting to note that the number of oligodendrocytes in total varied between samples, and that the RT\u2013PCR results suggested that this was not an artefact and could be a part of the multiple sclerosis pathology where oligodendrocyte cell death is a feature. This is to our knowledge the first study to use a (semi-)quantitative approach to determine the relative viral load in tissue samples. Our results suggest that HHV-6 activity is a feature of multiple sclerosis pathology in many patients, although it is not possible from the current evidence to prove a role in initiation. It has been postulated that multiple sclerosis may be initiated and/or propagated through interactions between the immune system and one or more viruses, in a manner analogous to that documented for other diseases (Welsh and Selin, 2002; Nagai and Osame, 2003; Nowak et al., 2003). How a virus enters the brain and initiates multiple sclerosis is currently the subject of debate (Fazakerly and Walker, 2003; Tsunoda and Fujinami, 2002; Tsunoda et al., 2003). Key properties that may be expected of a candidate virus include neurotropism, latency and reactivation. In addition, some aspect of the viral infection cycle and/or genome should be able to suggest possible mechanisms in the initiation and/or propagation of the immune response that causes the demyelination typical of multiple sclerosis. In the most recent publications investigating a viral link with multiple sclerosis, herpesviruses have predominated (Simmons, 2001). One family member, EBV, was one of the early candidates and continues to be an important focus/area of current research (Ascherio et al., 2001; Levin et al., 2003; Alotaibi et al., 2004; Haahr et al., 2004). HHV-6 may be present in a latent state in oligodendrocytes and subsequently reactivated as part of multiple sclerosis pathogenesis (a raised activity preceding new lesions may explain the high levels of viral mRNA seen in morphologically NAWM of multiple sclerosis patients). It is possible that HHV-6 may even integrate into the host cell genome, staying undetected and inactive for years. Interestingly, studies have indicated that HHV-6 may have a preferred integration site located to chromosome 17p13.3 (Morris et al., 1999). Located to this site are a number of genes whose interaction with HHV-6 could theoretically contribute to multiple sclerosis pathogenesis. Inappropriate expression of CXCL16, a chemokine ligand that may be involved in T-cell migration and T- and dendritic cell interactions (Matloubian et al., 2000), could enhance the autoimmune response, whilst reduction in PITPN (phosphatidylinositol transfer protein) could result in neuronal degeneration (Hamilton et al., 1997). Activation of SERPIN/PEDF (pigment epithelium-derived factor) could also initiate neurodegeneration due to the neurotrophic properties of the protein (Simonovic et al., 2001), whilst increased expression of GPCR42 (G protein-coupled receptor 42) could render a cell sensitive to retroviral infection (Ericsson et al., 2003). Possibly the most interesting scenario is integration downstream of the TRPV 3 (transient receptor potential channel, subfamily V, member 3) promoter, which is heat activated (Smith et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2002). HHV-6 could then be transcribed/activated during febrile episodes, which would explain the frequent exacerbation of multiple sclerosis following common viral infections such as the common cold. Alternatively, HHV-6 may be constitutively active in oligodendrocytes, with infectivity kept in check in normal brains, whilst the disregulated immune system of multiple sclerosis patients is unable to control periodical flare-ups of the virus that may in turn contribute to the pathology of the disease.",

            "text": "The recently reported detection of HHV-6 in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy surgical brain sections (Donati et al., 2003) suggests that HHV-6 activity seen in brain samples is not necessarily linked to an inflammatory response. Consistent with these findings is the fact that we also detected viral gene expression in normal control brain samples. This does not imply that the inflammatory response fails to increase the level of viral activation, and the observation of very high levels of activation in the two AIDS brain samples does strongly suggest that this may indeed occur. In the majority of our tissue samples (multiple sclerosis and normal controls), we observed that HHV-6 gene expression tended to occur in clusters of oligodendrocytes instead of single cells evenly distributed throughout. Although we did not see active HHV-6 infection in all oligodendrocytes, we suggest that it is possible that many/most may contain the virus in a latent state (with latency transcripts below the limit of detection by our mRNA FISH) capable of subsequent reactivation (possibly as a side effect of a localized inflammatory response, or with a different virus/pathogen as co-factor in the reactivation process). Our observations complement the experimental results and theory forwarded by Rotola et al. (2004) that HHV-6 reactivation and replication may occur only in certain sites, triggered by local factors and contained within a small area.",

            "text": "How do our findings fit in with previous published studies on a putative link between HHV-6 and multiple sclerosis? A direct comparison is difficult to make as the majority of studies have examined peripheral blood and CSF samples, and studies on brain tissue samples have generally been limited to detection of viral DNA and/or protein. A recent review by Clark (2004) provides an up to date examination of previous publications based on research strategy, and highlights how similar studies can produce varying and often contradictory results and conclusions. The closest comparisons with our study would be published papers based on the analysis of human brain tissue. In PCR-based studies, those that examined normal control brain tissue found that HHV-6 DNA could also be detected to a varying degree, ranging from 13.5% (Friedman et al., 1999) to >70% (Challoner et al., 1995). The frequency of HHV-6 genome detection in multiple sclerosis lesion samples also varied, ranging from 36% (Friedman et al., 1999) to 78% (Challoner et al., 1995). Our own examination of genomic DNA extracted from tissue samples showed that the HHV-6 genome could be detected in all samples (see Fig. 4C) and is consistent with conclusions that the presence of the viral genome in the CNS is not implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (Sanders et al., 1996). Results on brain sections using immunohistochemistry may be as confusing and variable as the PCR results, although sample numbers are much lower. For studies that included non-multiple sclerosis control tissue, multiple sclerosis positivity ranged from just under 50% (Friedman et al., 1999) to >70% (Knox et al., 2000), with control tissue positivity 0 and 8%, respectively. Differences in tissue protein preservation and pre-treatment (as well as use of different antibodies) could explain the variable results. The non-uniform pattern of mRNA expression seen in our tissues also suggests that viral protein distribution may be random, increasing the chances of a negative result in tissues where viral activity is low (as we see in our control tissues as well as in some of the multiple sclerosis samples). In CSF and serum samples, detection of cell free HHV-6 DNA is considered proof of active viral infection, but the results are as variable and confusing as in the brain tissue studies. For CSF, results range from no detection of HHV-6 DNA in either multiple sclerosis or normal control samples (Taus et al., 2000) to 46% of multiple sclerosis samples and 20% of controls being positive (Tejada-Simon et al., 2002). In serum studies, the results are even more diverse, ranging from no detection in either multiple sclerosis or control samples (Wilborn et al., 1994) to 66 and 33% in multiple sclerosis and control samples, respectively (Tejada-Simon et al., 2002). The variable level of infection seen in our tissues, as quantified by the number of oligodendrocytes exhibiting active HHV-6 infection, suggests that the level of viral DNA released may vary and could easily fall below the level of detection of many of the PCR assays. The use of different primers and reaction conditions, as well as varying methods of DNA extraction, makes direct comparisons between these papers extremely difficult. Serial serum samples taken at several time points (ideally spanning a year or more) would help elucidate the extent of HHV-6 activity in the general population compared with multiple sclerosis subjects, provided a reliable sensitive PCR methodology has been established and used as routine in all laboratories. For post-mortem samples, this is of course not possible, but ideally the \u2018next best thing\u2019 would be several tissue samples from both NAWM and different lesions from the same individual.",

            "text": "It would be important to determine whether increased HHV-6 activity (as determined by blood markers) could be linked to multiple sclerosis exacerbations and thus be used to indicate a need for early treatment with antiviral agents specific for HHV-6 (using carrier molecules capable of passing the blood\u2013brain barrier). It would also be important to determine whether any of the oligoclonal bands so characteristic of (Correale and Molinas, 2002), but not exclusive to, the CSF of multiple sclerosis patients contain antibodies that react with HHV-6 antigens. An unequivocal demonstration of an active HHV-6 infection in multiple sclerosis patients, but not in normal individuals, would clearly have specific therapeutic implications. There are several studies that do link multiple sclerosis exacerbations with increased HHV-6 activity (Berti et al., 2002; Chapenko et al., 2003; Alvarez-Lafuente et al., 2004). Direct comparison of the results of these studies is impossible due to the differences in techniques and PCR primers used, and may explain the divergence in results with the percentage of patients in exacerbation also exhibiting active HHV-6 infection ranging from 22% (Berti et al., 2002; Alvarez-Lafuente et al., 2004) to 76.9% (Chapenko et al., 2003). Comparison with our results is also difficult since our samples are post-mortem tissue from patients predominantly in the secondary progressive phase of the disease, whereas relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis predominates in the serum-based studies. Before any large-scale study into treatment/prevention of HHV-6-linked exacerbations can be contemplated, establishing a commonly adopted stringent PCR-based detection assay for detection of HHV-6 in serum with maximum sensitivity is essential. Whether the global upregulation of HHV-6 gene transcription that we have detected in multiple sclerosis patients relative to controls is pathogenically significant remains an open question, but one that needs to be resolved in further studies. It is particularly important to determine whether specific cofactors exist that may render the viral infection significant enough to justify antiviral therapy.",
