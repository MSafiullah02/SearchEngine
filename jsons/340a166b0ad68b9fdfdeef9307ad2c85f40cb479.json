            "text": "The novel coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) was first confirmed in the Chinese city of Wuhan, late December, 2019. The rapidity of its spread in many countries around the globe made the WHO declare it as a global pandemic and public health emergency, raising concerns that if countries with robust healthcare systems to detect and control disease outbreak are having challenges managing the disease, countries with weak healthcare system need to put adequate measures in place to contain the spread [1] . The coronavirus disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents clinical features which are similar to the diseases caused by other coronaviruses, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome such as lower respiratory illness with fever, dry cough, myalgia, shortness of breath etc. The Coronavirus disease is \"novel\" in the sense that, it is a new strain of zoonotic origin which has not been previously discovered to affect humans. Historically, the COVID-19 pandemic is a major human coronavirus epidemic in the last two decades aside SARS [2] and MERS [3, 4] respectively. The incubation period of COVID-19 is between 2 -14 days with symptoms averagely between 5-7 days. Its basic reproduction number is averaged 2.2 [5] and even more ranging from 1.4 -6.5 in [6] . Globally as at May According to literatures the bilinear and standard incidences has been extensively studied by various authors in [33 -36] and others. Another kind of incidence that is of interest to our work is the Saturation incidence. In 1973, sequel to the study of cholera epidemic which occurred in Bari, Capasso and Serio [22] introduced the saturated incidence denoted as \u221e Matias [20] studied a model for disease transmitted by vector with saturating incidence such that the model assumes a saturating effect in the incidence due to the response of the vector to change in the susceptible and infected densities. The Saturation incidence seems more realistic than the bilinear incidence due to the inclusion of behavioural change and crowding effect of the infective. In the face of the current realities from COVID-19, it is evident that we have high saturation incidence in which useful strategies need to be deployed to contain the spread through various interventions such as good hygiene, physical/social distancing, partial/total lockdown, travel/public gathering ban, good treatments, contact tracing, pool testing etc can help to reduce the high rate of secondary infections as stipulated by the WHO guidelines.",
