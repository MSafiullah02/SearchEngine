            "text": "Previous studies indicated that CD94 could be induced on PBLs, but that induction required the prolonged combination of TCR engagement and exposure to IL-15.50 This led us to examine the effect of TCR stimulation and IL-15, alone or in combination, on CD94 expression by IELs. IELs were isolated from histologically normal surgical samples, and CD94-negative cells were further purified by cell sorting. CD94-negative IELs, which included 90%\u201395% TCR\u03b1\u03b2+CD8+ cells, were stimulated during a short period of time, 18\u201336 hours, with anti-CD3 antibodies and/or IL-15 before multicolor flow-cytometric analysis using anti-CD8 and CD94. Figure 6 shows that IL-15 alone, or TCR stimulation alone, rapidly and selectively induced CD94 on up to 40%\u201350% of IELs, whereas less than 10% of unstimulated cells induced CD94.\nInduction of CD94 was detected as early as 18 hours after culture and is shown at 24 hours. The prompt and important increase in the frequency of CD94 expression, in the absence of changes in cell recovery (data not shown), rules out the possibility of selective expansion or survival of a minor subset of CD94+ contaminants among the FACS-purified cells. Adding anti-CD3 antibody did not significantly enhance the effect of IL-15 in 6 separate experiments. In contrast, expression of CD56 and CD16 was consistently unaffected (data not shown). In addition, within a time frame ranging from 18 to 36 hours in 3 different experiments, IFN-\u03b3 had little effect on CD94 expression, and other cytokines that may be present in normal and/ or inflammatory intestine, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, and transforming growth factor \u03b2, had no detectable effect alone or in combination with TCR stimulation. We confirmed in 3 separate experiments that, within this time frame, neither IL-15 alone nor the combination of IL-15 and TCR stimulation induced CD94 on CD8-high PBLs (which include 98% TCR\u03b1\u03b2+), as previously reported.50 Furthermore, we showed that even the minor subset of CD45RO+CD8+ PBLs that may be functionally closer to IELs than CD45RO\u2212CD8+ PBLs displayed little induction of CD94 (5%\u20137%) (Figure 6). Thus, in marked contrast with both RO+ and RO\u2212 CD8+ PBLs, a large fraction of IELs promptly expressed CD94 in response to IL-15 alone and, to a lesser degree, to TCR stimulation alone. Finally, to examine whether IL-15 might play a role in the expression of CD94 by IELs in celiac disease, we examined the presence of IL-15 in intestinal tissue sections. The IL-15 protein was mainly detected in ECs of the villi in the normal intestine and was strongly expressed by crypt and villi ECs as well as by numerous lamina propria cells in active celiac disease (Figure 7).\n\n",

The results showed that IELs and PBLs markedly differed in the frequency of T cells expressing NK receptors as well as in the nature of the NK receptors expressed. Thus, more than 60% of T-IELs vs. only 20%\u201330% of T-PBLs expressed at least 1 NK receptor. NKR-P1A was expressed on a much larger subset of T-IELs than T-PBLs, and Pen5 and NKp46 were expressed by a subset of T-IELs but not by T-PBLs. Conversely, CD57 was expressed by a subset of T-PBLs but not by T-IELs. These NK receptor\u2013expressing T-IELs, or a subset of them, might be the counterpart to the mouse NK receptor\u2013expressing T-IELs, which are thought to differentiate in the gut wall and expand in response to self antigens.29, 61, 62 Alternatively, the expression of NK receptors on human T-IELs could be the consequence of particular activation events. In any case, our data suggest that the gut epithelium is a unique environment that favors the differentiation and/or expansion of particular subsets of NK receptor\u2013expressing T cells in humans as well as in mice. Some NK receptors, such as CD16, endow T-IELs with NK-like properties23 that may contribute to the innate defense of the intestinal epithelium.25, 26, 27, 28 Other NK receptors, such as CD94,63, 64, 65 function as regulators of TCR-mediated signaling by modulating the activation threshold of the TCR. Accordingly, our recent studies of T-cell clones derived from CD8+TCR\u03b1\u03b2+ IELs indicate that CD94 can modulate TCR-mediated cytotoxicity (unpublished data, Bana Jabri and Nadine Cerf-Bensussan, January 1999). These functional properties may profoundly influence the outcome of the local immune responses, and it is therefore of particular significance that distinct patterns of NK receptors may be expressed in particular types of inflammatory processes of the intestine.",

In this context, it was important to further characterize the nature of the expanding cells, particularly with respect to their pattern of NK receptor expression, because NK receptors may regulate the interactions of IELs with the altered epithelium of celiac patients. Our results indicated that active celiac disease is associated with a striking increase in CD8+ TCR\u03b1\u03b2+ IELs expressing the CD94 NK receptor. This increase was specific of active celiac disease and was not observed in various other types of villous atrophies, including autoimmune enteropathy, or in Crohn's disease.

            "text": "A remarkable finding of this study was that the induction of NK receptors seemed to be a selective process because CD94 was the only NK receptor tested whose expression was markedly increased in active celiac disease. This observation suggested that induction of CD94 could be dissociated from that of other NK receptors in vivo. Our in vitro studies further confirmed that CD94 induction was selective because CD94, but not the other NK receptors tested (such as CD16 and CD56, data not shown), could be induced on CD8+ T-IELs upon TCR and IL-15 stimulation. A selective induction of CD94 upon treatment with anti-TCR and IL-15 was also recently reported for PBLs.50 However, there seem to be some interesting differences between the response of PBLs and IELs to these stimuli. CD94 expression by PBLs required the combined stimulation by anti-TCR and IL-15 over a period of 4\u20136 days,50 but IELs expressed CD94 as early as 18 hours after stimulation with IL-15 alone, and, to a lesser degree, with TCR stimulation alone. This unusual property of IELs was not shared by the minor subset of CD45RO+CD8+ PBLs, which is functionally closer to IELs than the bulk of PBLs, suggesting that the ability to rapidly induce CD94 upon exposure to IL-15 is not a common feature of memory CD8+ T cells. A possible explanation for these differences is that, by prior exposure to antigens in the gut microenvironment, T-IELs were \u201cprimed\u201d for CD94 induction. Our in vitro studies further indicated that cytokine-mediated induction of CD94 was the restricted property of IL-15 because other inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 consistently failed to induce high levels of CD94. IL-15 can be secreted by the intestinal epithelium33 and is a potent activator of human IELs, stimulating their proliferation, cytotoxicity, and IFN-\u03b3 secretion.67 In addition, IL-15 favors migration of lymphocytes68 and induces expression of several chemokines and chemokine receptors on lymphocytes.69 Altogether, these findings suggest a scenario whereby after TCR-mediated activation and exposure to the cytokines of the epithelial microenvironment, including IL-15, celiac disease IELs not only up-regulate CD94 expression, but also increase their cytotoxic properties through the induction of perforin and granzyme B.70 Our finding that IL-15 is abundant in the intestinal epithelium of celiac disease is consistent with this scenario. The local events leading to TCR engagement remain to be elucidated. One could speculate that celiac disease IELs recognize as yet undefined antigens induced on the intestinal epithelium in response to gliadin. Such a mode of response to stress has recently been suggested for TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ IELs using the variable V\u03b41 region, a subset of IELs known to be increased in celiac disease5, 17, 18 and that respond to the stress-induced MICA/MICB HLA molecules.19\n",

Interestingly, we found that the proportion of CD94+ T-IELs expressing the CD94/NKG2A inhibitory receptor was low in celiac disease.
